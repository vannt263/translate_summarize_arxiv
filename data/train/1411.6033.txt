    "besides noninvasive imaging at low intensities , ultrasound is commonly used at high acoustic powers in therapeutic applications such as kidney stone lithotripsy or tumor treatment @xcite . indeed high - intensity focused ultrasound ( hifu ) can induce strong mechanical stresses and shear wave propagation in biological tissues @xcite or even cell membrane permeabilization and rupture through cavitation @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , hifu has not yet been used in the fundamental context of soft disordered `` jammed '' systems although the physics of jamming has attracted tremendous attention over the last two decades @xcite .",
    "soft jammed materials range from emulsions , foams and colloidal suspensions to granular materials and typically show a transition from fluidlike to solidlike behavior upon increasing the volume fraction @xcite . among them",

    "have been dedicated to dry grains under unfocused , low - frequency ultrasound , reporting rather limited fluidization effects such as creep motion of weakened contacts @xcite or shock wave propagation @xcite . in this article",
    "we introduce hifu as a useful , versatile tool to remotely exert a _ localized _ volumic force onto a dense three - dimensional granular assembly and to trigger its unjamming . above a critical ultrasonic intensity , stresses due to the so - called acoustic radiation pressure @xcite become high enough to induce large - scale flows within the pile .",
    "we show both experimentally and numerically through space- and time - resolved velocity measurements that this local unjamming transition displays intermittency and hysteresis",
    ". further analysis of the simulated stress tensor reveals that in the intermittent regime , after an acoustic pulse has unjammed the system , the state of the packing at rest is undistinguishable from the previously jammed state so that unjamming can not be predicted from standard static observables .",
    "a simple two - state model involving an effective noise temperature reproduces qualitatively the observed features .",
    "we first describe our experimental setup and numerical methods in sect .",
    "[ sec : matmeth ] .",
    "there we also emphasize the structure of the ultrasonic field and show that acoustic radiation pressure dominates over other nonlinear acoustic effects .",
    "experimental and numerical results are detailed in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we analyze the structure of the simulated packings , devise the two - state model and compare our work to previous studies on more classical fluidization modes in granular materials .",
    "we conclude this article by listing a number of questions that remain unanswered and some possibilities for future research .",
    "as sketched in fig .  [ fig : setup](a ) a dense packing of spherical beads is submitted to mechanical solicitations from hifu generated by a high - power hemispherical piezoelectric transducer ( imasonic , diameter @xmath0 , center frequency @xmath1 , wavelength @xmath2 in water at room temperature ) whose acoustic impedance is matched with water .",
    "polydisperse glass beads ( usf matrasur , batch f03 7911 , density @xmath3 ) were sieved to achieve a mean diameter @xmath4 with a standard deviation of @xmath5 .",
    "these grains are first poured up to a height of roughly @xmath6 into a cell of size @xmath7 filled with distilled water and whose open face is closed with a thin plastic membrane that has been checked to be transparent to ultrasound .",
    "the cell is finally reversed upside down so that the grains sediment under gravity and rest onto the membrane .",
    "both the cell and the ultrasonic transducer are immersed in a large water tank ( @xmath8 ) filled with water at @xmath9 .",
    "images of the granular packing are captured with a ccd camera ( baumer hxc20 ) at up to 300  fps .",
    "bursts of sinusoidal waves at @xmath1 and of duration @xmath10 , hereafter referred to as `` pulses '' , are emitted every @xmath11 using a low frequency generator ( agilent 33522a ) and a power amplifier ( kalmus 150c ) .",
    "the duty cycle is limited to @xmath12 to avoid heating of the transducer and the maximum achievable acoustic pressure at focus is @xmath13 . in all cases",
    "the rest time of 1.5  s between two pulses is long enough so that all grains in the packing come to a complete stop .",
    "no cavitation bubbles were detected during or between pulses in both the water tank and the experimental cell .",
    "prior to any experiment , the pile is submitted to two successive cycles of ultrasonic pulses whose amplitude is progressively increased up to the maximum acoustic power and then decreased back to 0 , in order to reach a reproducible initial state ( see also the discussion on hysteresis in sect .  [",
    "sec : hysteresis ] ) . next various protocols and analyses",
    "are applied : time - resolved studies of grain motion within a single pulse ( sect .",
    "[ sec : unjamming ] ) , long series of successive pulses with a constant amplitude ( sect .  [ sec : intermittency ] ) , and cycles of pulses with increasing then decreasing amplitudes ( sect .  [ sec : hysteresis ] ) .",
    "we checked that all our results are qualitatively unchanged when the pulse duration is varied .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup](b ) shows pressure field measurements @xmath14 obtained by scanning a needle hydrophone ( precision acoustics 1659sn with active element diameter 40  @xmath15 m ) in water in the absence of the experimental cell .",
    "for these measurements we use short , low - intensity pulses of sinusoidal waves at frequency @xmath16  mhz with a fixed amplitude , a duration of 10  @xmath15s and a pulse repetition frequency of 1  khz .",
    "the output voltage from the hydrophone is digitized by an oscilloscope ( agilent 33522a ) and the pressure amplitude @xmath14 is computed from an average over 1,000 successive pulses .",
    "the position of the hydrophone is controlled by three - axis precision translation stages ( physik instruments m-410pd ) and the origin @xmath17 is taken at the focal point where the pressure amplitude reaches its maximum value @xmath18 .",
    "the two - dimensional scans of fig .  [ fig : setup](b ) , performed with steps @xmath19  @xmath15 m and @xmath20  @xmath15 m , show that the acoustic field generated by our focused transducer is axisymmetric around the direction of propagation and that the acoustic power is localized in a small focal spot of diameter @xmath21 and focal depth @xmath22 at @xmath23 , located at @xmath0 from the vibrating surface . as reported in the lower panels of fig .",

    "pressure measurements in the presence of grains are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](c ) . in this case , as scanning the pressure field directly within the grains would damage the hydrophone , a couple of grain layers were deposited on the membrane located in the focal plane @xmath32 and the needle hydrophone was scanned just above the grains .",
    "we checked that the pulse duration was short enough to ensure the absence of any grain motion due to acoustic radiation forces .",
    "the pressure field of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](c ) shows strong heterogeneity and speckle - like features : due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between the glass beads and the surrounding water , the ultrasonic incident beam gets scattered and the acoustic field behind the grain layers is strongly distorted .",

    "[ fig : setup](b ) ] .",
    "we conclude from fig .  [",
    "fig : setup](c ) that when the cell is filled with grains the pressure field rapidly decays after a few grain layers due to strong scattering by the glass beads . for this practical reason we chose to locate the ultrasound focal spot within the first grain layers ( at about 0.5  mm behind the membrane ) . in order to optimize the visualization of the grain displacements ,",
    "the ultrasonic beam is focused at about 1  mm behind the wall of the cell facing the ccd camera [ see fig .  [",

    "is simply given as the acoustic pressure @xmath36 measured at the focal spot in the absence of grains .",

    "this estimate is however obviously very crude as , in our case , ( i )  the sphere has a diameter comparable to the acoustic wavelength and ( ii )  the acoustic field is strongly focused over a few acoustic wavelengths .",
    "therefore one has to take into account the exact forms of both the acoustic field radiated by the sphere and the focused incident beam .",
    "this more general case of a small elastic sphere in a focused beam has been worked out in @xcite . beside the longitudinal wave velocity , it involves the velocity @xmath56 of shear waves within the obstacle ( @xmath57  ms@xmath30 for glass ) . implementing the full computation in our experimental conditions leads to @xmath58 for @xmath52  mpa .",
    "nonlinear acoustic propagation also induces attenuation which results in momentum transfer from the acoustic wave to the fluid and hence in a flow field with velocity @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "modeling the acoustic beam around the spherical obstacle as a cylinder of radius @xmath60 and length @xmath61 , the magnitude of @xmath59 at focus can be estimated as  @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the wave pulsation and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the dynamic and bulk viscosities of the fluid respectively .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as `` acoustic streaming . '' for our experiment at @xmath16  mhz in water , with @xmath66  mm and @xmath67  mm , we find a typical streaming velocity of @xmath68  cms@xmath30 for @xmath52  mpa .",
    "note that this estimate does not account for the presence of bounding walls and obstacles . in practice",
    "this velocity most probably largely overestimates the actual streaming velocity which is strongly limited by both the presence of the membrane and the large compacity of the granular packing . in any case , if present , such streaming flow is the cause of a steady inertial force acting on the obstacle that reads  @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mass of the fluid displaced by the elastic sphere . finally , for small reynolds numbers , the streaming flow also exerts a viscous drag on the obstacle : @xmath71    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : streaming ] ) and ( [ eq : drag ] ) respectively yield @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath52  mpa .",
    "therefore the forces due to acoustic streaming are about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath58 . since @xmath74 and @xmath75 this remains valid over all our experimental pressure range .",
    "we conclude that acoustic radiation pressure always dominates forces due to acoustic streaming .",
    "this result is also supported by movies of the granular packing that show that the typical velocity and acceleration of the grains within the focal spot are @xmath76  ms@xmath30 and @xmath77  ms@xmath78 respectively , well above the ( over)estimated @xmath79 and similar to the acceleration due to acoustic radiation pressure .       used in the simulation and plotted in a logarithmic color scale ( db ) .",

[ fig : dem](a ) ] .",

    "this subtle difference between the two groups of pulses can also be evidenced by investigating the statistics of the pressure increments from one pulse to the next one , @xmath139 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stats](c ) , the distribution of @xmath140 slightly depends on whether pulse number @xmath127 has induced unjamming or not .",
    "when grains remain in a jammed state , the average and standard deviation of the increments are respectively @xmath141 and 28.8 , while one gets @xmath142 and 36.0 when fluidization occurs .",
    "this means that the local pressure tends to increase when the system remains in the jammed state ( i.e. the packing is consolidated by successive pulses ) while fluidization leads on average to smaller pressure levels yet with larger spatial variations ( i.e. increased disorder ) .",
    "we also note that in the intermittent regime , the probability density function of @xmath143 displays exponential tails that lie between the fully jammed and unjammed cases which respectively display tails that are close to power - law and gaussian distributions .",

    "note that using a uniform distribution or a lognormal distribution for @xmath144 would avoid the problem of negative stress values .",
    "we checked that the predictions of the model are not significantly affected by the probability density function provided the mean and variance of @xmath176 are kept constant .",

    "[ fig : intermittency](c ) . in the case of the cycling protocol",
    ", hysteresis is predicted with properties similar to the experiments . upon increasing the pulse amplitude @xmath148",
    "the system always unjams above a threshold that is significantly larger than that obtained for jamming upon decreasing @xmath148 . on the decreasing branch",
    "there is generally no new fluidization event once a jammed state has been reached .",
    "however the decreasing branch displays important variability and some intermittency is observed on the increasing branch .",
    "a typical example of a single hysteresis cycle is displayed in the inset of fig .",

    "[ fig : model](b ) .",
    "this last figure shows that despite important variability in the cycles there exists a clear hysteresis and typical values for jamming and unjamming thresholds are consistent with the boundaries of the intermittent regime obtained in the experiments .",
    "we note however that the number of pulses over which the system remains ( un)jammed is much larger in single realizations of our model ( typically hundreds of pulses ) than in experiments and simulations ( typically tens of pulses ) .",
    "more intermittent signals can be obtained by tuning the parameters of the model but the corresponding cycling protocols no longer provide clear hysteresis branches and rather remain strongly intermittent throughout the intermediate regime .",

    "when @xmath179 or @xmath180 is increased while keeping @xmath176 and @xmath115 constant , i.e. when lowering the effective temperatures , the @xmath181 curves and the hysteresis cycles are observed to shift towards larger @xmath148 values but their shapes are roughly conserved . on the other hand , when @xmath179 or @xmath180 is decreased , the curves shift to smaller @xmath148 and the hysteresis eventually disappears .",

    "when the number of pulses per step @xmath115 is increased in the cycling protocol with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the hysteresis cycle keeps roughly the same amplitude but shifts to larger @xmath148 , most likely because the probability of getting trapped in a deep energy minimum largely exceeds that of being fluidized again .",

    "[ fig : model](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) results from an average over independent realizations that are intrinsically symmetric , jumping from 0 to 1 , as the material can only be either fully jammed or fully fluidized in the model . in the experiments and simulations",
    "however , only part of the system may be jammed or fluidized and local heterogeneities can be highly correlated through avalanches or long - range force chains . capturing the asymmetry of the hysteresis certainly requires to include such local effects in the model .",
    "classical methods for perturbing grain assemblies include shear @xcite , vertical vibrations @xcite , thermal cycling @xcite and injection / suction of an interstitial fluid @xcite .",
    "they all involve a _ global _ driving of the material at the scale of the container .",
    "so far unjamming a granular packing _ locally _ had only been achieved through intrusive methods , e.g. by moving an intruder or by blowing a fluid through a granular material @xcite . here",
    "we have shown that hifu can remotely induce local fluidization through acoustic radiation pressure , in contrast with previous ultrasonic studies on granular packings that reported much weaker effects @xcite .",
    "moreover this fluidization mode displays intermittency and hysteresis , two distinctive features that are commonly encountered in the physics of granular materials .",
    "for instance , experiments in a rotating drum have shown both features in avalanching behavior along the grain surface @xcite .",
    "hysteresis is also typical of the compaction kinetics of a granular column under vertical tapping @xcite and of fluidization in tapered granular beds @xcite . in the latter case hysteresis",
    "was attributed to the formation of a fluidized cavity at the bottom of the bed which compresses the jammed region when the inlet flow velocity is progressively ramped up . in the present acoustically - induced fluidization",
    "however , energy is injected discontinuously into the granular packing and the system is given enough time to come to full rest and to relax possible density heterogeneities between two pulses , so that a similar mechanism is unlikely to explain hysteresis . to build a proper comparison with previous works on fluidized beds ,",
    "future hifu experiments should focus on a continuous insonification of granular packings by using transducers that can sustain high power levels on durations much longer than 1  s without overheating .",
    "finally we note that arguments similar to those expressed in the heuristic model of sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] have already been used in the context of granular materials by @xcite . there , activated processed were invoked to describe the logarithmic strengthening of granular materials under continuous shear .",
    "the present results open a number of questions regarding ( i )  the state of the hifu - induced fluidized state compared to the jammed state , ( ii )  the possibility of long - range effects similar to those induced by steady shear in split - bottom cells @xcite and ( iii )  the physical interpretation of intermittency and hysteresis from microscopic approaches . throughout this article",
    "we have highlighted subtle yet most probably physically relevant differences between experimental and numerical results .",
    "for instance the fact that simulated hysteresis cycles are smaller than in the experiments [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] ] hint at weaker memory effects .",
    "this would be consistent with the time series of figs .",
    "[ fig : intermittency](a ) and ( b ) where the experimental fluidized area @xmath182 appears to remain correlated over a larger number of successive pulses than the simulated @xmath183 . together with the observation of different short - time transient responses in figs .",
    "[ fig : unjamming](d ) and ( h ) , these discrepancies between experiments and simulations point to the possible influence of the interactions between grains , of their surface roughness and/or of the interstitial fluid on the fluidization characteristics and more specifically on its history - dependence .",
    "since friction has been recognized to crucially influence the jamming of granular packings , whether static @xcite , sheared @xcite or compressed @xcite , it can also be naturally expected to play a significant role in hifu - induced unjamming . therefore addressing the above issues",
    "calls for more work where the grain properties shall be systematically varied .    to conclude hifu appears as a useful , nonintrusive tool to locally unjam granular packings .",
    "more generally it could be further used to probe the physics of jamming in assemblies of soft particles . by tuning the acoustic properties of both the fluid and the grains so that radiation pressure still dominates over streaming but with much less scattering , e.g. by using packings of hydrogel particles in glycerol ",
    "water mixtures , we can expect to target virtually any position within the bulk .",
    "this should allow us to map the local susceptibility of the packing in three dimensions and hence identify stronger / weaker zones within the jammed material .",
    "such heterogeneities could then be analyzed in terms of local correlation lengths as a function of the initial packing fraction , in an effort to address the long - standing issue of diverging scales upon three - dimensional jamming @xcite . finally , on the applicative side",
