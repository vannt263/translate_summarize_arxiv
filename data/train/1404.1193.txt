    "driven by environmental concerns , green wireless communications have recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia .",
    "it is reported in @xcite that the world - wide cellular networks consume about sixty billion kilowatt hour ( kwh ) of energy per year , which result in a few hundred million tons of carbon dioxide emission yearly .",
    "these figures are expected to increase rapidly in the near future if no further actions are taken . on the other hand ,",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite that , with the explosive growth of high data rate wireless applications , more energy is consumed to guarantee the users quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "these facts create a compelling need for green wireless communications .",
    "one way to achieve green wireless communications is to improve the energy - efficiency of the current communications networks @xcite .",
    "another way is to introduce clean and environment - friendly renewable energy ( such as solar power and wind power ) to wireless communications networks @xcite .",
    "introducing energy harvesting capabilities to wireless communications is a promising approach to achieve green communications , with its great potential to reduce the carbon dioxide emission produced by conventional energy .",
    "however , it poses lots of new challenges on the design of resource allocation strategies for the wireless communications networks .",
    "this is mainly due to the highly time - varying availability of the renewable energy .",
    "for instance , solar energy and wind energy may vary significantly over time and locations depending on the weather and the climate conditions .",
    "thus , conventional transmit power constraints are not suitable to model communications devices with renewable energy .",
    "instead , resource has to be allocated subject to energy harvesting constraints . with energy harvesting constraints , in every time slot , the transmitter is allowed to use at most the amount of harvested and stored energy currently available . in other words ,",
    "the transmitter can not consume any energy harvested in future .",
    "throughput optimization for wireless communications systems with such energy harvesting constraints has been extensively studied in recent literatures .",
    "the capacity of awgn channel with the energy harvesting system setup was studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "throughput maximization for a single - user energy harvesting system with a deadline constraint in a static channel was studied in @xcite and @xcite . for single - user fading channel ,",
    "the optimal energy allocation scheme to maximize the throughput for a slotted system over a finite horizon of time slots was obtained in @xcite through dynamic programming . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors derived continuous time optimal policies to maximize the throughput of fading channels with the energy harvesting constraints .",
    "then , energy allocation strategies to maximize the throughout of multiple access channels and broadcast channels with energy harvesting constraints were investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "throughput maximization for relay channels with energy harvesting constraints was studied in @xcite .",
    "another line of related research in wireless communications with energy harvesting nodes focused on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer @xcite .",
    "the idea of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer was proposed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the tradeoff between information rate and power transfer in a frequency selective wireless system .",
    "then , the tradeoff between energy and information for a mimo broadcast system was studied in @xcite . in @xcite , operation protocols and switching schemes to minimize the outage probability for wireless systems with simultaneous information and power transfer were studied . in @xcite , practical receiver designs for implementing simultaneous information and power transfer were investigated . in @xcite ,",
    "a new protocol was proposed to achieve simultaneous bi - directional wireless information and power for a multi - user communication network .    in these aforementioned works ,",
    "the communications devices are powered only by the renewable energy . however , due to the highly random availability of the renewable energy , communications devices powered only by the renewable energy may not be able to guarantee a required level of qos . since in many communication systems , such as in a cellular communications , the qos must be satisfied at least with high probability , a hybrid energy supply system with both renewable energy supply and conventional energy supply is preferred in practice .",
    "this motivated us to consider a communications system with both energy harvesters and conventional energy supply in this paper .",
    "as an incentive to promote the use of the renewable energy , we assume that the renewable energy has a lower cost than the conventional energy . under this assumption , minimizing the energy consumption is not equivalent to minimizing the energy cost . in this paper , unlike the conventional energy - efficient studies whose objective is minimizing the energy consumption , our objective is to minimize the total energy cost .",
    "the motivation for this is that , from a user s perspective , minimizing the total energy cost is more important and meaningful .",
    "the contribution and the main results of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* we consider a point - to - point communications system with both renewable energy and conventional energy .",
    "to guarantee the qos of the system , we propose an outage constraint , which requires a minimum number of slots to be reliably decoded .",
    "this constraint is useful if , for example , an outer code is used to recover all data bits .",
    "a mixed integer programming problem is then formulated to minimize the total energy cost of such a system for @xmath0 fading slots under both energy harvesting constraints and the proposed outage constraint .",
    "* we study the optimal power allocation strategy to minimize the total energy cost by assuming full knowledge of the channel and energy state information ( cesi ) . by exploring the structured properties of the optimal solution , we propose two low complexity algorithms with worst case linear time complexity to yield the optimal power allocation for two extreme cases : when the number of outage slot is either @xmath1 or @xmath2 . * for the general case , we propose a lower bound based on linear programming relaxation . besides , we propose two suboptimal algorithms referred to as _ linear programming based channel removal _ ( lpcr ) and _ worst channel removal _ ( wcr ) , respectively .",
    "it is shown by simulation that the proposed suboptimal algorithms exhibit only a small gap with respect to the lower bound .",
    "it is proved that wcr is optimal when certain conditions are satisfied .",
    "* we extend the proposed algorithms and the obtained results to the multi - cycle scenario where the outage constraint is imposed for each cycle separately .",
    "it is shown that the proposed algorithms can be easily extended to the multi - cycle scenario with few modifications .",
    "* when cesi is not available , a new outage constraint is proposed .",
    "closed - form solution is obtained for this case .",
    "it is shown that the optimal solution has a greedy feature .",
    "it always uses the low - cost energy first and uses the high - cost energy only when necessary ( i.e. , when the low - cost energy is not enough to guarantee the required qos ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the system model in section [ sec - sysmodel ] and give out the problem formulation in section [ sec - problemformulation ] .",
    "the proposed algorithms and obtained theoretical results are then presented in section [ sec - theoresults ] . in section [ sec - nocsi",
    "] , we investigate the power allocation strategy when future csi and energy harvesting information is not available .",
    "then , in section [ sec - numericalresults ] , numerical results are presented to verify the proposed studies .",
    "finally , section [ sec - conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this paper , we consider a point - to - point channel with one transmitter ( tx ) and one receiver ( rx ) .",
    "we assume that the transmitter has access to two types of energy : conventional energy and renewable energy",
    ". the conventional energy is obtained from conventional power grid or batteries .",
    "the renewable energy is obtained by energy harvesting devices , such as solar panel and wind turbine .",
    "these two types of energy are provided to the transmitter at different prices : @xmath3 per unit for conventional energy , and @xmath4 per unit for renewable energy . for exposure",
    ", we make the following assumptions in this paper .",
    "* @xmath5 .",
    "we make this assumption due to the following two reasons : the renewable energy greatly depends on the environment ( such as the weather ) , and thus is not as reliable as the conventional energy .",
    "therefore , the renewable energy should be priced lower to attract users .",
    "the renewable energy is clean and environment - friendly .",
    "thus , pricing the renewable energy at a lower price provides an incentive for users to use green energy . *",
    "the transmission is slotted , and the tx is equipped with an energy storage device . the energy harvested at the beginning of slot @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the harvested energy @xmath7 can be used is slot @xmath6 or stored for future use .",
    "the conventional energy and the renewable energy consumed at slot @xmath6 are denoted as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . *",
    "the channel experiences block - fading and remains constant during each transmission slot , but possibly changes from one slot to another .",
    "the channel power gain is assumed to be a random variable with a continuous probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath10 .",
    "the channel power gain for slot @xmath6 is denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "the noise at the rx is assumed to be a circular symmetric complex gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath12 denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the whole transmission process consists of @xmath0 time slots . under the system model given in section [ sec - sysmodel ] , the instantaneous transmission rate in slot @xmath6 can be written as @xmath14 .",
    "thus , if the target transmission rate of the user is @xmath15 , the minimum power required to support this rate is @xmath16    we refer to @xmath17 as * _ channel inversion power _ * for slot @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath18 , we say the user is in outage in slot @xmath6 . for convenience ,",
    "we define an indicator function for each slot , which is given as @xmath19    to guarantee the qos , we assume that the fraction of outage should be kept below a prescribed target @xmath20 .",
    "mathematically , this can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is given by . in this paper",
    ", we refer to this constraint as * _ outage constraint_*. this outage constraint requires at least @xmath23 packets to be received without error over @xmath0 slots , which is useful for delay - sensitive data or when an outer code is used that can correct any @xmath24 packets in outage . clearly , if @xmath25 , no outage is allowed . in this paper , we assume that the harvested energy can be stored for future use . thus , the _ energy harvesting constraints _ can be written as @xmath26    in this paper , our objective is to minimize the total energy cost of the @xmath0-slot transmission through proper energy allocation strategies . under the constraints described above , the problem can be formulated as follows .",
    "[ problem-3 ] @xmath27    where @xmath22 is given by . for notation convenience",
    ", we use @xmath28 instead of @xmath22 in the rest of the paper .",
    "problem [ problem-3 ] is a mixed integer optimization problem , which is difficult to solve optimally @xcite .",
    "for the problem considered here , we assume full cesi , i.e. , the channel power gains ( i.e. , @xmath29^t$ ] ) and the energy harvesting state information ( i.e. , @xmath30 @xmath31^t$ ] ) are known at the tx as a _",
    "priori_. this assumption is fairly strong and may not be practical",
    ". however , the solution provides a lower bound on the energy cost and sheds insights on the design of energy allocation strategies with partial cesi where not all information is available in advance .",
    "problem [ problem-3 ] is a non - convex optimization problem .",
    "thus , standard convex optimization techniques can not be applied to solve this problem . to solve problem [ problem-3 ]",
    ", we start our analysis by exploring the properties that problem [ problem-3 ] has and then design algorithms based on these properties .",
    "we start by analyzing this problem to obtain structural properties of the optimal solution , which is useful in developing good sub - optimal algorithms later .",
    "[ lemma-1 ] denote the set of slots in which the user is in outage as @xmath32 .",
    "then , at the optimal solution of problem [ problem-3 ] , we have @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the cardinality of a set and @xmath35 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath36 .    first , any feasible solution of problem [ problem-3 ] must satisfy the constraint .",
    "thus , we have @xmath37 . now , suppose @xmath38 .",
    "then , we can always drop more slots such that holds with equality .",
    "thus , the energy cost of these slots becomes zero .",
    "obviously , by doing this , the value of is reduced .",
    "this contradicts with our presumption that @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 must be equal to @xmath41 .",
    "proposition [ lemma-1 ] indicates that the optimal allocation strategy is to drop as many slots as allowed by the outage constraint . in those dropped slots ,",
    "the user should shut down its transmission , and thus consumes no energy .",
    "we next consider the case where the set of outage slots is fixed , and determine the optimal power allocation policy under this condition .",
    "we first state a lemma that may be of independent technical interest .",
    "[ lemma-0 ] an optimal policy for the following linear program @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "proof of this lemma follows from observing that the policy satisfies the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions  @xcite for the linear program .",
    "since the kkt conditions are sufficient for optimality of linear programs  @xcite , this policy is optimal . the proof is given in the part a of the appendix .",

    "it is not difficult to observe that is equivalent to @xmath54 obviously , the objective function is minimized when it holds with equality for all @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 furthermore , it is also easy to see that our optimization problem is equivalent to setting @xmath57 for all @xmath58 . based on these observations , problem [ problem - complement ] can be converted to we note that problem 3 has the same structure as the linear program in lemma  [ lemma-0 ] . applying lemma  [ lemma-0 ] to with @xmath59 and @xmath60 then concludes our proof of proposition  [ lemma-2 ] .",
    "proposition [ lemma-2 ] indicates that the power allocation is zero for both conventional and harvested energy in dropped slots .",
    "this is clearly optimal in terms of energy saving .",
    "it is also observed that for the remaining slots , the harvested energy should be used first .",
    "if the harvested energy is not enough to support the target rate during these slots , conventional energy should be used as a compensation .",
    "this is similar to the greedy use of harvested energy whenever possible , and thus highlights the fundamental difference of prioritizing the use of ( cheap ) harvested energy over ( expensive ) conventional energy .",
    "thus , for convenience , we refer to the power allocation given in as * _ greedy power allocation_*.      from the results obtained in proposition [ lemma-1 ] and proposition [ lemma-2 ] , it is observed that problem [ problem-3 ] in general can be solved in two steps : ( 1 ) find the set of the time slots that should be dropped , i.e. , @xmath52 .",

    "then , the harvested energy consumed during slot @xmath69 is @xmath75 .",

    "thus , no energy is consumed in slot @xmath69 and @xmath78 in case 1 can be saved for future use . if @xmath79 , the energy cost generated by slot @xmath6 is @xmath80 , which is less than @xmath76 .",

    "now , we look at the energy harvest constraints under @xmath52 and @xmath127 , respectively . under @xmath52 , we have @xmath145 . while under @xmath124 , we have @xmath146 .",
    "all the remaining energy harvest constraints are exactly the same for the two cases .",
    "thus , we are always able to set @xmath147 and @xmath148 for all the remaining time slots . then",
    ", it is observed that the resultant total energy cost under @xmath52 is always less or equal to that under @xmath124 . using the same approach",
    ", we can prove that the total energy cost under @xmath52 is lower than that under any other feasible solution set of problem [ problem-3 ] .",
    "in the previous subsections , we consider the single - cycle scenario , i.e. , the outage constraint is imposed over @xmath0 continuous slots from one cycle . in this subsection , we consider the multi - cycle scenario , in which the outage constraint is imposed on each cycle .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath109 cycles , and each cycle has @xmath0 time slots . in each cycle , the maximum number of slots that can be dropped is @xmath149 .",
    "then , the energy cost minimization problem with energy harvesting constraints can be formulated as follows .",
    "[ problem - sm ] @xmath150    where @xmath151 since problem [ problem-3 ] is a special case of problem [ problem - sm ] , we expect the optimal solution of problem [ problem - sm ] to be hard to obtain .",
    "thus , in this subsection , we develop two suboptimal algorithms to solve problem [ problem - sm ] based on the lpcr and wcr developed for the one - cycle case .",
    "the extension from the one - cycle case to the multi - cycle case depends on an important property of problem [ problem - sm ] , which is presented in the following proposition .",
    "[ pro-1 ] at the optimal solution of problem [ problem - sm ] , the constraints given by must hold with equality , i.e. , @xmath152 .",
    "proposition [ pro-1 ] can be proved by the same approach as proposition [ lemma-1 ] .",
    "thus , details are omitted here for brevity .    in the following , we present the multi - cycle lpcr and the multi - cycle wcr , respectively .      denote the leftover harvested energy of cycle @xmath6 as @xmath153 , and denote the initial storage energy of cycle @xmath6 as @xmath154",
    ", we can extend the lpcr to the multi - cycle scenario , which is given as follows .",
    "initialization : @xmath155",
    ".    solve problem [ problem - relaxtion ] with initial storage @xmath154 for cycle @xmath6 by existing linear programming solvers such as cvx .",
    "sort the obtained @xmath156 in cycle @xmath6 in descending order , and drop the first @xmath149 slots .",
    "apply the greedy power allocation scheme during the rest of time slots in cycle @xmath6 .",
    "the multi - cycle lpcr algorithm solves the multi - cycle problem cycle by cycle .",
    "we note that it is the leftover harvested energy that couples the cost minimization problem of different cycles .",
    "for example , if no harvest energy is left for future cycles , the optimization problem in each cycle can be solved independently . in the following ,",
    "we investigate how the leftover harvested energy affects the energy cost .",
    "[ pro-3 ] define initial storage state to be @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "let @xmath159 be the optimal policy at storage state @xmath157 and @xmath160 be the optimal policy at storage state @xmath161 .",
    "let @xmath162 and @xmath163 denote the total energy cost under @xmath157 and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "then , the cost difference is bounded by @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath166 .    see part b of the appendix for details .      it is observed that the multi - cycle lpcr algorithm requires solving a series of linear programming problems , which may incur high complexity for the worst - case scenario .",
    "thus , in this part , we develop the multi - cycle wcr , which is implemented by a simpler suboptimal algorithm .",
    "sort the time slots according to the descending order of channel power gains in each cycle .    drop the worst @xmath149 time slots in each cycle .",
    "apply the greedy power allocation scheme during the rest of time slots .",
    "the key idea of the multi - cycle wcr is to remove the worst @xmath149 channels in each cycle .",
    "it is clear that multi - cycle wcr is in general not optimal .",
    "however , when certain conditions are satisfied , the multi - cycle wcr gives the optimal solution . in the following ,",
    "we give out a sufficient condition for the multi - cycle wcr to be optimal .",
    "[ pro-4 ] if wcr is the optimal solution for each individual cycle @xmath167 , then the multi - cycle wcr is the optimal solution for problem [ problem - sm ] .",
    "see part c of the appendix for details .",
    "under this assumption , we model the qos criterion by the following the equation . @xmath168",
    "this constraint requests the outage probability of the user s transmission in each time slot to be less than or equal to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the outage probability of the whole transmission process is less than or equal to @xmath20 . with this constraint ,",
    "the energy cost minimization problem is formulated as    [ problem-1 ] @xmath169    [ theorem-1 ] the optimal solution @xmath46^t$ ] for problem [ problem-1 ] is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171^t$ ] , and @xmath172^t$ ] .",
    "it is east to observe that the constraints given in are equivalent to @xmath173 since the distribution of @xmath11 s is i.i.d and with the cdf @xmath174 , then it is easy to observe that @xmath175 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath176 define that @xmath177 , where @xmath178 .",
    "since the cdf function @xmath179 is an increasing function with respect to @xmath180 , and @xmath180 is a decreasing function with respect to @xmath181 , it can be inferred that @xmath179 is a decreasing function with respect to @xmath181 .",
    "thus , can be converted to @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the inverse function of @xmath174 . thus , to minimize the power consumption , should hold with equality for each @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath184 then , it follows that @xmath185 and based on these equations , problem [ problem-1 ] can be converted to @xmath186 this problem has the same structure as the linear optimization problem in lemma  [ lemma-0 ] . applying lemma  [ lemma-0 ] with @xmath187 and",
    "@xmath60 then concludes the proof . and",
    "thus can be easily solved .",
    "to minimize , the user is opt to draw power from the renewable energy source , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the renewable energy has a lower cost than the conventional energy , i.e. , @xmath188 .",
    "thus , it is clear that @xmath189 and @xmath190 when @xmath191 . on the other hand , when @xmath192 , we have @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "in this section , we present several numerical examples to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimal and suboptimal algorithms .      in the simulation , the target transmission rate @xmath15 of the user",
    "is set to one .",
    "the receiver noise power @xmath12 is also assumed to be one . unless specifically declared , we assume i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading for all channels .",
    "thus , the channel power gains are exponentially distributed , and we assume that the mean of the channel power gain is one . the conventional energy is priced at @xmath195 per unit , and the harvested energy is priced at @xmath196 per unit . the incoming energy @xmath7 is modeled as a random variable with uniform distribution over the range @xmath197 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath198 . in practice ,",
    "the characteristics of the incoming energy depends on the type of renewable energy source .",
    "for example , it is shown in @xcite that the energy can be modeled as a markovian chain with memory . for a given type of energy harvester",
    ", the characteristics of the incoming energy can be obtained through long - term measurements .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the assumption of particular distributions of the channel power gains and the incoming energy does not change the structure of the problems studied and the algorithms proposed in this paper .                in this subsection",
    ", we consider the case that there are @xmath199 time slots . in fig .",
    "[ fig - myfig3a ] , we plot the total energy cost vs. the number of dropped slots .",
    "the result is obtained by averaging over @xmath200 channel realizations .        in fig .",
    "[ fig - myfig3 ] , we plot the gap between the suboptimal schemes and the lower bound vs. the number of dropped slots .",
    "the result is obtained by averaging over 1000 channel realizations .",
    "it is observed that lpcr performs better than wcr in general .",
    "however , wcr performs close to the lower - bound when the number of slots to be dropped is either small ( less than 80 ) or large ( more than 160 ) . for intermediate range ( about 120 slots ) , wcr has about a @xmath201 gap from the lower bound .",
    "the intuition is as follows .",
    "when there are @xmath199 slots , it is likely that there will be a small number of slots that are in deep fading . at the optimal solution ,",
    "these slots are likely to be dropped as the cost required to serve these slots is very high , even if all of them are using the cheap renewable energy .",
    "similarly , it is also likely that there will be a number of slots in which the channel power gain is high , and these slots are likely to be kept as only a small amount of energy is needed to serve these slots . since wcr is a greedy heuristic in which channels with low power gains are dropped , it is likely to agree with the optimal solution when the number of slots to be dropped is small or large . however , at the intermediate range , in addition to dropping the channels in deep fading and keeping channels with high power gains , we also have to make a decision on channels with moderate power gains .",
    "wcr only drops the channels with lower power gains , but does not take into account the renewable energy supply pattern . for channels with moderate power gains , the variation in the renewable energy supply may result in channels with lower power gains being kept in the optimal solution .",
    "this results in the sub - optimality of wcr .",
    "in contrast , in the lpcr algorithm , we try to take into account the variation in renewable energy through linear programming relaxation , resulting in a better performance in the intermediate range compared to wcr .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the problem of communicating over a block fading channel in which the transmitter has access to an energy harvester and a conventional energy source , and sought to minimize the total energy cost of the transmitter , subject to an outage constraint .",
    "this problem is shown to be a mixed integer programming problem .",
    "optimal algorithms with worst case linear time complexity have been obtained in two extreme cases : when the number of slots in outage is @xmath1 or @xmath2 . for the general case of allowing @xmath202 slots in outage , using a linear programming relaxation ,",
    "we have obtained an efficiently computable lower bound as well as a suboptimal algorithm ( upper bound ) , linear programming based channel removal ( lpcr ) , for this problem . using a greedy heuristic ,",
    "we have also proposed another suboptimal algorithm with lower complexity , worst - channel removal ( wcr ) , and have shown that this algorithm is optimal under some channel conditions .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that these algorithms exhibit only a small gap to the lower bound .",
    "then , we show that the results obtained for the single - cycle case can be extended to the multi - cycle scenario with few modifications .",
    "finally , when the only causal information on the energy arrivals and only channel statistics are available , we have introduced a new outage constraint and obtained the optimal resource allocation .",
    "to prove lemma  [ lemma-0 ] , we verify the kkt conditions for the proposed policy . for @xmath203",
    ", we have @xmath204 the first two conditions are satisfied since @xmath205 is always chosen to be feasible .",
    "it remains to choose @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 . to this end , we set @xmath209 .",
    "let @xmath210 be the largest index such that @xmath211 . if there is no such index , we set @xmath212 . if @xmath213 , we set @xmath214 and @xmath215 for @xmath216 ; we set @xmath217 for @xmath218 and @xmath219 for @xmath220 .",

    "hence , these choices are feasible . if @xmath223 , we set @xmath215 for all @xmath6 and @xmath224 for all @xmath6 .",
