    "the casimir effect@xcite is the force and also the specific polarization of the vacuum arising in restricted quantization volumes and originating from the zero - point oscillations of quantized fields .",
    "this force acts between two closely spaced macrobodies , between an atom or a molecule and macrobody or between two atoms or molecules . during more than fifty years ,",
    "passed after the discovery of the casimir effect , it has attracted much theoretical attention because of numerous applications in quantum field theory , atomic physics , condensed matter physics , gravitation and cosmology , mathematical physics , and in nanotechnology ( see monographs  and reviews  ) . in multidimensional kaluza - klein supergravity",
    "the casimir effect was used@xcite as a mechanism for spontaneous compactification of extra spatial dimensions and for constraining the yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity.@xcite in quantum chromodynamics the casimir energy plays an important role in the bag model of hadrons.@xcite in cavity quantum electrodynamics the casimir interaction between an isolated atom and a cavity wall leads to the level shifts of atomic electrons depending on the position of the atom near the wall.@xcite both the van der waals and casimir forces are used@xcite for the theoretical interpretation of recent experiments on quantum reflection and bose - einstein condensation of ultracold atoms on or near the cavity wall of different nature .",
    "in condensed matter physics the casimir effect turned out to be important for interaction of thin films , in wetting processes , and in the theory of colloids and lattice defects.@xcite the casimir force was used to actuate nanoelectromechanical devices@xcite and to study the absorption of hydrogen atoms by carbon nanotubes.@xcite theoretical work on the calculation of the casimir energies and forces stimulated important achievements in mathematical physics and in the theory of renormalizations connected with the method of generalized zeta function and heat kernel expansion.@xcite all this made the casimir effect the subject of general interdisciplinary interest and attracted permanently much attention in the scientific literature .",
    "the last ten years were marked by the intensive experimental investigation of the casimir force between metallic test bodies ( see refs .",
    " ) . during this time the agreement between experiment and theory on the level of 1 - 2% of the measured force",
    "was achieved .",
    "this has become possible due to the use of modern laboratory techniques , in particular , of atomic force microscopes and micromechanical torsional oscillators .",
    "metallic test bodies provide advantage in comparison with dielectrics because their surfaces avoid charging . in refs .",
    ", where the importance of the casimir effect for nanotechnology was pioneered , it was demonstrated that at separations below 100 nm the casimir force becomes larger than the typical electrostatic forces acting between the elements of microelectromechanical systems .",
    "bearing in mind that the miniaturization is the main tendency in modern technology , it becomes clear that the creation of new generation of nanotechnological devices with further decreased elements and separations between them would become impossible without careful account and calculation of the casimir force .",
    "successful developments of nanotechnologies based on the casimir effect calls for more sophisticated calculation methods of the casimir forces .",
    "most of theoretical output produced during the first decades after casimir s discovery did not take into account experimental conditions and real material properties of the boundary bodies , such as surface roughness , finite conductivity and nonzero temperature .",
    "the basic theory giving the unified description of both the van der waals and casimir forces was elaborated by lifshitz@xcite shortly after the publication of casimir s paper .",
    "it describes the boundary bodies in terms of the frequency dependent dielectric permittivity @xmath0 at nonzero temperature @xmath1 . in the applications of the lifshitz theory to dielectrics it was supposed that the static dielectric permittivity ( i.e. , the dielectric permittivity at zero frequency ) is finite .",
    "the case of ideal metals was obtained from the lifshitz theory by using the so - called schwinger s",
    "prescription,@xcite i.e. , that the limit @xmath2 should be taken first and the static limit @xmath3 second . for ideal metals the same result , as follows from the lifshitz theory combined with the schwinger s prescription , was obtained independently in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in matsubara formulation.@xcite however , the cases of real dielectrics and metals ( which possess some nonzero dc conductivity at @xmath4 and finite dielectric permittivity at nonzero frequencies , respectively ) remained practically unexplored for a long time .",
    "the case of semiconductor boundary bodies was also unexplored despite of the crucial role of semiconductor materials in nanotechnology .",
    "starting in 2000 , several theoretical groups in different countries attempted to describe the casimir interaction between real metals at nonzero temperature in the framework of lifshitz theory .",
    "they have used different models of the metal conductivity and arrived to controversial conclusions . in ref .  , using the dielectric function of the drude model , quite different results than for ideal metals were obtained . according to ref .",
    ", at short separations ( low temperatures ) the thermal correction to the casimir force acting between real metals is several hundred times larger than between ideal ones .",
    "in addition , at large separations of a few micrometers ( high temperatures ) a two times smaller magnitude of the thermal casimir force was found than between ideal metals ( the latter is known as `` the classical limit''@xcite ) . in refs .  ,   the dielectric permittivity of the plasma model was used to describe real metals and quite different results were obtained . at short separations",
    "the thermal correction appeared to be small in qualitative agreement with the case of ideal metals . at large separations for real metals",
    "the familiar classical limit was reproduced .",
    "later the approach of ref .   was supported in refs .  ,  .",
    "the plasma model approach can be used at such separations @xmath5 that the characteristic frequency @xmath6 belongs to the region of infrared optics .",
    "later a more general framework , namely the impedance approach was suggested@xcite which is applicable at any separation larger than the plasma wave length .",
    "it was supported in refs .  ,  ,  .",
    "in the region of the infrared optics , the impedance approach leads to practically the same results as the plasma model approach . as was shown in refs .",
    ",  , the drude model approach leads to the violation of the nernst heat theorem when applied to perfect metal crystal lattices with no impurities .",
    "this approach was also excluded by experiment at 99% confidence in the separation region from 300 to 500 nm and at 95% confidence in the wider separation region from 170 to 700nm.@xcite on the contrary , the plasma model and impedance approaches were shown to be in agreement with thermodynamics and consistent with experiment . the polemic between different theoretical approaches to the description of the thermal casimir force in the case of real metals can be found in refs .  ,  .    these findings on the application of the lifshitz theory to real metals have inspired a renewed interest in the casimir force between dielectrics . as was mentioned above , at nonzero temperature dielectrics possess an although small but not equal to zero dc conductivity . in ref .",
    ",   the van der waals force arising from the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate was shown to lead to large effect in noncontact atomic friction,@xcite a phenomenon having so far no satisfactory theoretical explanation .",
    "this brings up the question : is it necessary or possible to take into account the dc conductivity of dielectrics in the lifshitz theory ? recall that in the case of a positive answer the static dielectric permittivity of a dielectric material would be infinitely large .",
    "it is amply clear that the resolution of the above issue should be in accordance with the fundamentals of thermodynamics . for this reason ,",
    "it is desirable to investigate the low - temperature behavior of the casimir free energy and entropy for two dielectric plates both with neglected and included effects of the dc conductivity .",
    "a major breakthrough in the investigation of this problem was achieved in the year 2005 . in ref .",
    "a new variant of perturbation theory was developed in a small parameter proportional to the product of the separation distance between the plates and the temperature . as a result",
    ", the behavior of the casimir free energy , entropy and pressure at low temperatures was found analytically .",
    "if the static dielectric permittivity is finite , the thermal correction was demonstrated to be in accordance with thermodynamics .",
    "this solves positively the fundamental problem about the agreement between the lifshitz theory and thermodynamics for the case of two dielectric plates . in ref .",
    "it was shown that , on the contrary , the formal inclusion of a small conductivity of dielectric plates at low frequencies into the model of their dielectric response leads to a violation of the nernst heat theorem .",
    "this result gives an important guidance on how to extrapolate the tabulated optical data for the complex refractive index to low frequencies in numerous applications of the van der waals and casimir forces .",
    "all these problems and related ones arising for semiconductor materials are discussed in this review .    in sec .",
    "2 we derive the analytical behavior of the casimir free energy , entropy and pressure in the configuration of two parallel dielectric plates at both low and high temperature .",
    "it is demonstrated that if the static dielectric permittivity is finite the lifshitz theory is in agreement with thermodynamics .",
    "sec .  3 contains the derivation of the low - temperature behavior for the casimir free energy and entropy between two dielectric plates with included dc conductivity . in this case the lifshitz theory is found to be in contradiction with the nernst heat theorem .",
    "the conclusion is made that the conductivity properties of a dielectric material at a constant current are unrelated to the van der waals and casimir forces and must not be included into the model of dielectric response . in sec .",
    "4 we consider the thermal casimir force between metal and dielectric .",
    "this problem was first investigated in ref .  .",
    "it was found that for dielectric plate with finite static dielectric permittivity the nernst heat theorem is satisfied but the casimir entropy may take negative values . here",
    "we not only reproduce an analytical proof of the nernst heat theorem but also find the next perturbation orders in the expansion of the casimir free energy and entropy in powers of a small parameter .",
    "the results obtained in high - temperature limit are also provided .",
    "5 is devoted to the casimir interaction between metal and dielectric plates with included dc conductivity of the dielectric material .",
    "we demonstrate that in this case the nernst heat theorem is violated .",
    "6 contains the discussion of semiconductors which present a wide variety of electric properties varying from metallic to dielectric .",
    "we consider the casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor test bodies and formulate the criterion when it is appropriate to include the dc conductivity of a semiconductor into the model of dielectric response .",
    "in doing so , the results of recent experiments@xcite on the measurement of the casimir force between metal and semiconductor test bodies are taken into account . to this point",
    "the assumption has been made that metal , dielectric and semiconductor materials of the casimir plates possess only temporal dispersion , i.e. , can be described by the dielectric permittivity depending only on frequency . in sec .",
    "7 we discuss recent controversial results by different authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "note that in this case @xmath229 at the first matsubara frequencies with @xmath230 and , thus , this quantity can not be considered as a small parameter . at the same time , for a high - resistivity sample the inclusion of the dc conductivity would lead to deviations from the dashed line in fig .",
    "3 only at frequencies @xmath231rad / s , which are much less than the characteristic frequency .",
    "this comparison permits to make a conclusion in what experimental situations the conductivity properties of semiconductors at low frequencies should be taken into account and when they should be omitted as being not related to dispersion forces .",
    "the future experiments on the modification of semiconductor charge carrier density by laser light@xcite will bring a more clear understanding of this problem on the connection between the low - frequency material properties and dispersion forces .",
    "the presented above new analytic results on the low - temperature behavior of the casimir free energy , pressure and entropy between dielectrics or between dielectric and metal are based on the conventional lifshitz theory which describes dielectric materials by means of the frequency dependent dielectric permittivity .",
    "in fact , the assumption that the material of the plates possesses only the frequency dispersion means that the components of electric displacement are connected with the components of electric field by the relation @xmath232 this equation is central in all different derivations of the lifshitz formula ( see , e.g. , refs .  ,   ,  ) .",
    "the effects of spatial nonlocality ( spatial dispersion ) are in fact essential only at shortest separations between the plates comparable with atomic dimensions and also for metals at sufficiently large separations ( typically of about 23@xmath233 m ) in the frequency region of the anomalous skin effect .",
    "the casimir force in the latter region was described by the lifshitz theory reformulated in terms of the leontovich impedance.@xcite    recently the spatial dispersion came to the attention in connection with the thermal casimir force.@xcite in particular , it was claimed@xcite that for real metals at any separation the account of spatial dispersion leads to practically the same result ( [ eq6 ] ) for the reflection coefficients at zero frequency as was obtained earlier using the drude model dielectric function ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this conclusion , if it is correct , not only returns us to the contradiction with experiment@xcite but also casts doubts on all results obtained by means of the conventional lifshitz theory accounting for only the frequency dispersion .",
    "it is natural when the spatial dispersion contributes a small fraction of a percent as it is generally believed in numerous applications of the lifshitz theory .",
    "it is , however , quite another matter when the account of the spatial dispersion results in some `` dramatic effects'',@xcite i.e. , in several hundred times larger thermal correction than is obtained in the local case .",
    "below we demonstrate that the conclusions of refs .",
    " are in fact not reliable because they use the lifshitz theory of dispersion forces outside of its application range.@xcite    to find the electromagnetic modes associated with an empty gap between the plates , refs .",
    " use the standard continuity boundary conditions , @xmath234 which are commonly applied in the derivation of the lifshitz formula for spatially local nonmagnetic materials . here",
    "@xmath235 is the magnetic induction , @xmath236 is the normal to the boundary directed inside the medium , the subscripts @xmath237 refer to the normal and tangential components , respectively , the subscript 1 refers to the vacuum and subscript 2 to the plate material . in refs .",
    " the spatial dispersion is described by the longitudinal and transverse dielectric permittivities depending on the wave vector and frequency : @xmath238 . however , as is shown below , in the theory of the casimir effect both the boundary conditions ( [ eq106 ] ) and permittivities @xmath238 are inapplicable .",
    "we start from the boundary conditions and recall the set of maxwell equations in a metal describing the casimir effect , @xmath239 equations ( [ eq107 ] ) do not contain any external , i.e. , independent on @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , current or charge densities .",
    "the definition of the electric displacement is @xmath243 where the volume current @xmath244 is induced by @xmath240 and @xmath242 and takes into account the conduction electrons .    in electrodynamics with spatial dispersion",
    "the electric field and magnetic induction are finite at the boundary surfaces , whereas the electric displacement can tend to infinity.@xcite then , integrating eqs .",
    "( [ eq107 ] ) over the thickness of the boundary layer as is done in ref .  , we reproduce the first two conditions in eq .",

    "they should not be mixed with the boundary conditions arising in perturbative theories and for the fictitious fields ( see below ) .    in linear electrodynamics for a medium with time - independent properties without spatial dispersion the material equation connecting the electric displacement and electric field takes the form @xmath247 according to this equation , the electric displacement at a point @xmath248 and moment @xmath249 is determined by the electric field at the same point @xmath248 at different moments @xmath250 ( the spatial dispersion is absent but the temporal may be present ) .",
    "it is easily seen that the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ eq111 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq110 ] ) leads to @xmath251 , @xmath252@xmath253 and , as a result , the boundary conditions ( [ eq109 ] ) coincide with the standard continuity conditions ( [ eq106 ] ) .",
    "it is unjustified , however , to use conditions ( [ eq106 ] ) in the presence of spatial dispersion . in refs .",
    "a few examples are presented illustrating that in this case neither @xmath254 nor @xmath252 is equal to zero .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the use of dielectric permittivity @xmath255 in the theory of the casimir effect with account of spatial dispersion . in the presence of only frequency dispersion , it is possible to perform the fourier transformation of the fields @xmath256 in eq .",
    "( [ eq111 ] ) and arrive at eq .",

    "in fact eqs .",
    "( [ eq105 ] ) , ( [ eq112 ] ) and ( [ eq113 ] ) are used in parallel with the boundary conditions ( [ eq106 ] ) in all derivations of the lifshitz formula.@xcite    if the material of the plates is characterized not only by temporal but also spatial dispersion , eq .",
    "( [ eq111 ] ) is generalized to @xmath259 if the material medium were uniform in space ( i.e. , all points were equivalent ) , the kernel @xmath260 would not depend on @xmath248 and @xmath248@xmath261 separately , as in eq .",

    "( [ eq114 ] ) , one could introduce the dielectric permittivities @xmath264 as refs .  ",
    "do , and rearrange eq .",
    "( [ eq114 ] ) to the form @xmath265    in the casimir effect , however , the material medium is not uniform due to the presence of a macroscopic gap between the two plates ( half spaces ) . because of this , the assumption that the kernel @xmath260 depends only on @xmath266 and @xmath49 is wrong . as a result ,",
    "it is not possible to introduce the dielectric permittivity @xmath267 depending on the wave vector and frequency .",
    "in fact , for systems with spatial dispersion in the presence of boundaries the kernel @xmath260 depends not only on @xmath266 and @xmath49 but also on the distance from the boundary.@xcite in this complicated situation the following approximate phenomenological approach is sometimes applicable.@xcite for electromagnetic waves with a wavelength @xmath268 the kernel @xmath269 in eq .",
    "( [ eq114 ] ) differs essentially from zero only in a certain vicinity of the point @xmath248 with characteristic dimensions @xmath270 ( for nonmetallic condensed media @xmath271 is of the order of the lattice constant ) .",
    "then it is reasonable to assume that @xmath260 is a function of @xmath266@xmath272@xmath248@xmath248@xmath261 , except for a layer of thickness @xmath271 adjacent to the boundary surface .",
    "if one is mostly interested in bulk phenomena and neglects the role and influence of a subsurface layer , the quantity @xmath267 may be employed as a reasonable approximation .",
    "this approximate phenomenological approach is widely applied in the theoretical investigation of the anomalous skin effect ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "some kind of fictitious infinite system was introduced and electromagnetic fields in this system are discontinuous on the boundary surface .",
    "this discontinuity should not be confused with the discontinuity of physical fields of a real system in the presence of spatial dispersion described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) and ( [ eq110 ] ) .",
    "( there is also another approach to the description of the anomalous skin effect in polycrystals using the generalizations of the local leontovich impedance which takes into account the shape of fermi surface@xcite ) .",
    "the frequency and wave vector dependent dielectric permittivity in the presence of boundaries is also approximately applied in the theory of radiative heat transfer@xcite or in the study of electromagnetic interaction of molecules with metal surfaces.@xcite in all these applications the boundary effects are usually taken into account by the boundary conditions ( [ eq109 ] ) supplemented by so called `` additional boundary conditions '' .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the approximate phenomenological approach using such quantity as @xmath267 in the presence of boundaries would be applicable in the theory of the casimir force where the boundary effects on the zero - point electromagnetic oscillations are of prime importance .",
    "it is notable also that this approach faces serious theoretical difficulties including the violation of the law of conservation of energy.@xcite it is then not surprising that the application of this approach in refs .",
    "results in the contribution to the casimir free energy from the transverse electric mode which is in contradiction with experiment.@xcite    one more shortcoming of refs .",
    " is that they substitute the dielectric permittivity @xmath267 , depending on both wave vector and frequency , into the conventional lifshitz formula derived in the presence of only temporal dispersion . in the famous review paper@xcite",
    "it has been noticed , however , that with the inclusion of spatial dispersion the free energy of a fluctuating field takes the form @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is given by the conventional lifshitz expression derived in a spatially local case and written in terms of the fresnel reflection coefficients , and @xmath275 is an additional term which can be expressed in terms of the thermal green s function of the electromagnetic field and polarization operator .",
    "review@xcite calls as not reliable the results of , e.g. , ref .",
    "obtained by the substitution of dielectric permittivity @xmath267 , taking account of spatial dispersion , into the conventional lifshitz formula .",
    "it can be true that the lifshitz formula written in terms of general reflection coefficients is applicable in both spatially local and nonlocal situations .",
    "however , as far as the exact reflection coefficients in a spatially nonlocal case are unknown , the use of some approximate phenomenological models , elaborated in literature for applications different than the casimir effect , may lead to incorrect results for @xmath275 and create inconsistencies with experiment .    to conclude this section , the results of refs .",
    " on the influence of spatial nonlocality on the casimir interaction are shown to be not reliable .",
    "although at present there is no fundamental theory of the thermal casimir force incorporating spatial dispersion , there is no reason to expect that it can play any significant role in the frequency region of infrared optics ( experimental separations ) or normal skin effect ( i.e. , at separations between plates greater than 45@xmath233 m ) .",
    "in the foregoing we have presented the derivation of analytic asymptotic expressions for the free energy , pressure and entropy of the casimir interaction between two dielectric plates and between metal and dielectric plates at low and high temperatures .",
    "it was shown that the low - temperature behavior of the casimir interaction between dielectrics and between dielectric and metal is determined by the static dielectric permittivities of nonpolar dielectrics .",
    "the obtained results were shown to be in agreement with thermodynamics when the static dielectric permittivities of dielectrics are finite .",
    "in particular , the entropy of the casimir interaction goes to zero when the temperature vanishes , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is satisfied .",
    "this demonstrates the consistency of the original lifshitz s approach to the van der waals forces between dielectrics which disregards the small conductivity of dielectrics at constant current .",
    "the second important result shown above is that the inclusion of the dc conductivity of dielectrics into the model of dielectric response leads not to some small corrections to the characteristics of the casimir interaction , as one could expect , but makes the lifshitz theory inconsistent with thermodynamics leading to the violation of the nernst heat theorem .",
    "this reveals that real material properties at very low , quasistatic frequencies are in fact not related to the phenomenon of the van der waals and casimir forces which is actually determined by sufficiently high frequencies . in this case the zero - frequency contribution to the casimir force should be understood not literally but as analytic continuation to zero of the material physical behavior in the region around the characteristic frequency .",
    "the presented results provide a basis for the calculation of the van der waals and casimir forces between real materials .",
    "such calculations are much needed for numerous applications of the casimir force discussed in the introduction , in particular for the applications in nanotechnology and for constraining predictions of fundamental physical theories beyond the standard model .",
    "bearing in mind that semiconductors are the main constituent materials in nanotechnological devices , it is a subject of high priority to understand the casimir effect with semiconductor boundaries . in this connection",
    "we have discussed new experimental results and theoretical ideas on the casimir interaction between a metal sphere and semiconductor plate .",
    "it was stressed that by changing the charge carrier density in the semiconductor it is possible to bring it in different intermediate states between metallic and dielectric . in this case",
    "the problem arises when the conductivity properties of semiconductor are not related to dispersion forces and when they are becoming relevant .",
    "a criterion for the resolution of this problem was formulated based on the relation between the typical frequency at which the dc conductivity properties come into play and the characteristic frequency of the casimir effect .",
    "in fact the thermal casimir interaction between semiconductors remains an open question and much work should be done both in experiment and theory to gain a better insight into this subject .",
    "the last major problem discussed in this review is whether or not the spatial dispersion influences essentially the thermal casimir force between real materials . in the present literature",
    "there is no agreement on this subject .",
    "we adduced arguments in favor of the statement that in the region of experimental separations the influence of the spatial dispersion on the casimir force is negligible small .",
    "the statements on the opposite , contained in the literature , were shown to be not reliable because they are obtained by the application of the lifshitz theory outside of its application range . at the same time",
    "it was ascertained that at the moment there is no consistent fundamental theory of the van der waals and casimir forces taking the spatial dispersion into account .",
    "this is the problem to solve in the foreseeable future .",

    "<S> we review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal casimir force acting between two dielectrics , dielectric and metal , and between metal and semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed derivation for the low - temperature behavior of the casimir free energy , pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real dielectric plates is presented . for dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivity </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the nernst heat theorem is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the lifshitz theory of the van der waals and casimir forces is demonstrated to be consistent with thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric plates is proved to lead to a violation of the nernst heat theorem and , thus , is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature asymptotics of the casimir free energy , pressure and entropy are derived also in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a finite static dielectric permittivity . </S>",
    "<S> if the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the nernst heat theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to the casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> discussions in the literature on the possible influence of spatial dispersion on the thermal casimir force are analyzed . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the conventional lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all present experiments . </S>"
