    "by definition , in a first order phase transition , thermodynamic state functions such as density @xmath1 and enthalpy @xmath2 change discontinuously as we cool the system along a path crossing the equilibrium coexistence line [ fig .",
    "[ p - t - fs](a ) , path @xmath3 .",
    "however in a real experiment , this discontinuous change may not occur at the coexistence line since a substance can remain in a supercooled metastable phase until a limit of stability ( a spinodal ) is reached @xcite [ fig .",

    "[ p - t - fs](b ) , path @xmath5 , the state functions continuously change from the values characteristic of a high temperature phase ( gas ) to those characteristic of a low temperature phase ( liquid ) .",
    "the thermodynamic response functions which are the derivatives of the state functions with respect to temperature [ e.g. , isobaric heat capacity @xmath6 have maxima at temperatures denoted @xmath7 .",
    "remarkably these maxima are still prominent far above the critical pressure @xcite , and the values of the response functions at @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) diverge as the critical point is approached .",
    "the lines of the maxima for different response functions asymptotically approach one another as the critical point is approached , since all response functions become expressible in terms of the correlation length .",
    "this asymptotic line is sometimes called the widom line , and is often regarded as an extension of the coexistence line into the `` one - phase region . ''    if the system is cooled at constant pressure @xmath9 , and @xmath9 is not too far from the critical pressure @xmath10 , then there are two classes of behavior possible .",
    "( i ) if @xmath11 ( path @xmath12 ) , then experimentally - measured quantities will change dramatically but continuously in the vicinity of the widom line ( with huge fluctuations as measured by , e.g. , @xmath13 ) .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath14 ( path @xmath15 ) , experimentally - measured quantities will change discontinuously if the coexistence line is actually seen .",
    "however the coexistence line can be difficult to detect in a pure system due to metastability , and changes will occur only when the spinodal is approached where the gas phase is no longer stable .",
    "the changes in behavior may include not only static quantities like response functions @xcite but also dynamic quantities like diffusivity .",

    "based on analogies with other network forming liquids and with the thermodynamic properties of the amorphous forms of water , it has been suggested that , at ambient pressure , liquid water should show a crossover between fragile behavior at high t to strong behavior at low t @xcite in the deep supercooled region of the phase diagram below the homogeneous nucleation line . this region may contain the hypothesized liquid - liquid critical point @xcite , the terminal point of a line of first order liquid - liquid phase transitions . according to one current hypothesis ,",
    "the liquid - liquid critical point is the thermodynamic source of all water s anomalies @xcite .",
    "this region has been called the `` no - man s land '' because to date no experiments have been able to make direct measurements on the _ bulk _ liquid phase @xcite .",
    "recently the fragility transition in confined water was studied experimentally @xcite since nucleation can be avoided in confined geometries .",
    "also , a dynamic crossover has been associated with the liquid - liquid phase transition in silicon and silica @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we offer an interpretation of the dynamic crossover ( called a fragility transition or fragile - strong transition by many authors ) in water as arising from crossing the widom line emanating from the hypothesized liquid - liquid critical point @xcite [ fig .",
    "[ p - t - fs](c ) , path @xmath5 .",
    "our thermodynamic and structural interpretation of the dynamic crossover may not hold for liquids for which the fragile - strong dynamic crossover can be caused by other mechanisms , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "using molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations , we study three models , each of which has a liquid - liquid critical point . two of the models , ( the tip5p @xcite and the st2 @xcite ) treat the water molecule as a multiple - site rigid body , interacting via electrostatic site - site interactions complemented by a lennard - jones potential .",
    "the third model is the spherical `` two - scale '' jagla potential with attractive and repulsive ramps [ fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla - pot ] ] which has been studied in the context of liquid - liquid phase transitions and liquid anomalies @xcite .",
    "for all three models , we evaluate the loci of maxima of the relevant response functions , compressibility and specific heat , which coincide close to the critical point and give rise to the widom line .",
    "we provide evidence that , for all three potentials , a dynamic crossover occurs when the widom line is crossed .",
    "our results for the tip5p potential are based on md simulations of a system of @xmath23 molecules , carried out both in the npt and nvt ensembles using the techniques described in @xcite . for st2 simulations",
    "@xmath24 molecules are used and all the simulations are carried out in nvt ensemble . for the jagla potential , discrete molecular dynamics simulation @xcite implemented for @xmath24 particles interacting with step potentials @xcite is used in both nvt and nve ensembles .",
    "[ fig : tip5p](a ) shows for tip5p the relevant portion of the @xmath17 phase diagram . a liquid - liquid critical point",
    "is observed @xcite , from which the widom line develops .",
    "the coexistence curve is negatively sloped , so the clapeyron equation implies that the high - temperature phase is a high - density liquid ( hdl ) and the low - temperature phase is a low - density liquid ( ldl ) .",
    "[ fig : tip5p](b ) shows the @xmath25 dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath26 , evaluated from the long time limit of the mean square displacement along isobars .",

    "the crossover between these two functional forms takes place when crossing the widom line .",
    "for paths @xmath15 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tip5p](d ) ] , crystallization occurs in tip5p @xcite , so the hypothesis that there is no fragility transition can not be checked at low temperature .",
    "hence we consider a related potential , st2 , for which crystallization is absent within the time scale of the simulation .",
    "simulation details are described in @xcite .",
    "this potential also displays a liquid - liquid critical point @xcite , as seen in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : st2](a ) .",
    "the analog of fig .",
    "[ fig : tip5p](b ) is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : st2](b ) . we confirm that along paths @xmath12 a fragility transition takes place [ fig .",
    "[ fig : st2](c ) ] .",
    "moreover , along paths @xmath15 the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath26 does not show any sign of crossover to arrhenius behavior and the fragile behavior is retained down to the lowest studied temperature ( note that @xmath29 extends to @xmath30 . indeed , for paths @xmath15 , the entire @xmath25 dependence can be fit by a power law @xmath31 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : st2](c ) ] .",
    "thus we see that the simulations for both tip5p and st2 water models support the connection between the widom line and the dynamic fragility transition .",
    "it is natural to ask which features of the water molecular potential are responsible for the properties of water discussed here , especially because water s unusual properties are shared by several other liquids whose inter - molecular potential has two energy ( length ) scales @xcite .",
    "we next investigate the two - scale spherically symmetric jagla potential .",
    "the jagla model displays  without the need to supercool  a liquid - liquid coexistence line which , unlike water , has a positive slope , implying that the widom line is now crossed along @xmath12 paths with @xmath32 [ figs .",
    "[ p - t - fs](d ) and [ fig : d - t - p](a ) ] .",
    "there is a crossover in the behavior of @xmath33 when the @xmath8 line is crossed [ figs .",
    "[ fig : d - t - p](b ) and  [ fig : d - t - p](c ) ] . at high temperature",
    ", @xmath26 exhibits an arrhenius behavior [ figs .",
    "[ fig : d - t - p](b ) and  [ fig : d - t - p](c ) ] , while at low temperature it follows a non - arrhenius behavior , consistent with a power law . along a @xmath15 path ( @xmath16 )",
    ", @xmath33 follows the arrhenius behavior over the entire studied temperature range [ figs .",
    "[ fig : d - t - p](b ) and  [ fig : d - t - p](d ) ] .",
    "thus , the dynamic crossover coincides with the location of the @xmath8 line , extending the conclusion of the tip5p and st2 potentials to a general two - scale spherically symmetric potential .",
    "before concluding , we note that our findings are consistent with the possibility that the observed dynamic crossover along path @xmath12 is related to the behavior of @xmath13 , suggesting that enthalpy or entropy fluctuations may have a strong influence on the dynamic properties . the role of @xmath13 is consistent with expectations based on the adam - gibbs @xcite interpretation of the water dynamics @xcite and of the fragility transition @xcite .    for both water and the jagla model , crossing the widom line",
    "is associated with a change in the t - dependence of the dynamics . in the case of water ,",
    "@xmath33 changes from non - arrhenius ( `` fragile '' ) to arrhenius ( `` strong '' ) behavior , while the structural and thermodynamic properties change from those of hdl to those of ldl . for the jagla potential , due to the _ positive _ slope of the widom line , @xmath33 changes from arrhenius to non - arrhenius while the structural and thermodynamic properties change from those of ldl to those of hdl .    in summary ,",
    "our results for water are consistent with the experimental observation in confined water of ( i ) a fragility transition for @xmath34 @xcite , and ( ii ) a peak in @xmath35 upon cooling water at atmospheric pressure @xcite .",
