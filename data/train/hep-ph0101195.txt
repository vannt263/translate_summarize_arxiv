    "bjorken sum rule_@xcite ( bsr ) .",
    "it was derived about thirty years ago in the framework of quark current algebra and it relates the first moment of the difference between @xmath231 for the proton and @xmath250 for the neutron and the neutron @xmath251-decay axial coupling @xmath252 = \\frac{1}{6 } g_a / g_v\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath253 is very accurately known .",
    "the bsr gets also a negative qcd correction and we will come back later to the test of this firm prediction of qcd .",
    "one can also derive sum rules for @xmath254 and @xmath255 separately .",
    "these are the _ ellis - jaffe sum rules_@xcite ( ejsr ) which read @xmath256 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are the @xmath251-decay axial coupling constants of the baryon octet and @xmath259 is the total polarization of the proton carried by the strange quarks .",
    "one recovers eq.([55 ] ) by taking the difference because @xmath260 . in their original work , ellis and",
    "jaffe made the critical assumption that @xmath261 , which allows to make definite predictions for @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",

    "this important sum rule which predicts @xmath268 for the proton , has never been tested directly due to the need for a circularly polarized beam with a longitudinally polarized target and a wide range of photon energies to be covered .",
    "however the gdh integral can be generalized to the case of absorption of polarized transverse virtual photons with @xmath2 @xmath269\\frac{d\\nu}{\\nu}.\\ ] ] one can show that , within a good approximation , one has in the scaling limit @xmath270 where @xmath271 , so the gdh sum rule is connected to polarized dis .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the generalized gdh sum rule has been measured by the hermes collaboration@xcite in the range @xmath272 ( see fig.[fig : igdh ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2-behavior of @xmath273 agrees with the theoretical prediction of ref.@xcite and this suggests that there are no important effects from either resonances or non - leading - twist .    concerning the structure function @xmath178 , which is related to transverse polarization ( see eq.([34 ] ) , but has no simple interpretation in the parton model , it is possible to derive a superconvergence relation by considering the asymptotic behavior of a particular virtual compton helicity amplitude .",
    "this leads to the _ burkhardt - cottingham sum rule_@xcite ( bcsr ) @xmath274 for proton and neutron and from this result , it has been naively argued that @xmath178 vanishes identically .",
    "actually from what we discussed in section  [ kindis ] about the asymmetry @xmath107 in the scaling limit , one can alternatively expect @xmath275 , a simple relation between @xmath127 and @xmath276 .",
    "however @xmath178 is more complicated than that@xcite and only part of it ( twist-@xmath277 contribution ) is entirely related to @xmath177 by means of the _ wandzura - wilczek sum rule_@xcite ( wwsr ) which reads for @xmath278 @xmath279 = 0\\ .\\ ] ] clearly for @xmath280 one recovers the bcsr eq.([57 ] ) and for @xmath281 one has @xmath282 very preliminary data obtained recently by e155x@xcite and shown in fig.[fig : g2e155 ] for proton , are consistent with eq.([59 ] ) , as shown by the dashed curves , but this has to wait for further confirmation .",
    "this approximation gives also the same kind of agreement with the @xmath107 data for proton and deuteron , as noticed above in fig.[fig : a2e155 ] .",
    "so far we have considered the proton structure in the framework of the qpm , a picture valid only in the scaling limit . for finite @xmath2 , there are several experimental facts which confirm the existence of scaling violations and we have already shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : f2p ] and [ fig : f3ccfr ] , the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath283 and @xmath284 , for different values of @xmath12 . for small @xmath12",
    ", @xmath283 increases with larger @xmath2 and for large @xmath12 , it decreases with larger @xmath2 .",
    "actually this can be understood in the framework of qcd , a color gauge theory , which is the underlying field theory for describing quark interactions and in particular , deep inelastic phenomena .    from the knowledge of the structure functions @xmath285 and @xmath286 , one basic observation , which was made long time ago , is the fact that in dis , the total fraction of the proton momentum carried by quarks and antiquarks , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath287 $ ] , is about @xmath100 .",
    "so half of the proton momentum is carried by electrically neutral objects , which have been identified with the gluons , already mentioned above .",
    "gluons are the carriers of the color force and therefore in the qpm diagram shown in fig.[fig : graph2 ] ( see also fig.[fig : proton ] ) , one can no longer neglect the possibility that the quark may radiate a gluon , before or after being struck by the virtual photon @xmath65 .",
    "these contributions are of order @xmath288 , where @xmath3 is the strong interaction coupling and moreover a gluon as a parton in the proton can contribute to dis via the diagram @xmath289 to the same order . from the qcd lagrangian and the corresponding feynman rules one can compute these contributions , so partons in qcd@xcite",
    "are no longer described by distributions which are functions of @xmath12 alone , but of @xmath12 as well as @xmath2 .",
    "these scaling violations will affect the predictions of the qpm and , as an example , the ratio @xmath56 ( see eq.([16 ] ) ) is not equal to zero , so the callan - gross relation ( see eq.([17 ] ) ) is not exact any more , and so on .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the parton ( quark , antiquark and gluon ) distributions has been investigated by several authors@xcite and can be summarized in the following way . given the parton distributions at some reference point @xmath290 ,",
    "the @xmath2 evolution is given by a set of coupled equations between singlet part with no gluon contribution . ]",
    "@xmath291 and gluon @xmath292 @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the number of flavors and the @xmath295 , the so - called splitting functions , are known@xcite .",
    "this set of equations , usually called the dglap equations , is valid in leading order ( lo ) qcd , but it can be generalized to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , _ i.e. _ by including corrections of order @xmath296 , because we have @xmath297 a more formal approach to derive the @xmath2 behavior of the structure functions is based on the use of the operator product expansion@xcite ( ope ) . the starting point is to consider time ordered products of two currents , which are related to the hadronic tensors introduced above , and to study their singularities on the light cone@xcite .",
    "this is also a very powerful method to derive directly sum rules in qcd , together with their radiative corrections at the level of one or several loops .",
    "concerning the polarized distributions there exists a set of equations similar to eq.([60 ] ) which provides their @xmath2 evolution@xcite , and the corresponding polarized splitting functions can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "we note that in addition to the quark ( antiquark ) polarizations @xmath298 , one also introduces the gluon polarization @xmath299 defined as in eq.([44 ] ) .",
    "this distribution plays also a crucial rle in connection with the anomaly of the axial current@xcite , as we briefly recall now@xcite . for a given flavor @xmath137 , the first moment @xmath300 is defined as the nucleon matrix element of the quark axial current @xmath301 due to the fact that this axial current is not conserved , it was shown@xcite that eq.([61 ] ) gets a gluon contribution which generates a shift of @xmath300 @xmath302 it is worth recalling that from the qcd evolution equations @xmath303 is @xmath2 independent , whereas @xmath304 increases logarithmically with @xmath2 , but such an increase exactly compensates the decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath2 . however the size of this gluonic correction , which can be partly absorbed in the definition of the quark distributions , is purely a matter of scheme convention @xcite .",
    "finally we note that so far , we have no direct experimental information on the sign and magnitude of @xmath305 .",
    "there is an enormous literature devoted to phenomenological work on dis but we shall discuss only very briefly , a few aspects of this broad area of high energy physics . clearly one particular goal is to parametrize all the parton distributions as function of @xmath12 , at a given low @xmath2 value , @xmath306 , and to test whether the @xmath2 evolution agrees with the qcd predictions . in several analysis@xcite",
    "the quark and gluon parton densities were described by a polynomial standard form @xmath307 where @xmath308 are free parameters .",
    "these twenty or so parameters were determined by making a global nlo fit of the data on unpolarized structure functions and the results obtained are rather satisfactory .    in a different approach , one is using , for valence quarks and antiquarks , a set of fermi - dirac distributions@xcite , with the following expression @xmath309 + 1 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath310 plays the role of the `` thermodynamical potential '' and @xmath311 is the `` temperature '' .",
    "the gluon density function @xmath312 is given in this approach by a bose - einstein distribution with no free parameter .",

    "we note that , as expected @xmath149 quarks dominate over @xmath123 quarks , @xmath316 and the @xmath138 and @xmath317 quarks are very small .",
    "clearly the gluon distribution @xmath318 , which was divided by a factor 10 and represented by the curve @xmath319 in the figure , dominates largely in the small @xmath12 region .",
    "the predictions obtained in a larger @xmath2 range are in excellent agreement with the ccfr data for @xmath320 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3ccfr ] and also with the very recent data at hera - desy from the zeus and h1 collaborations@xcite on @xmath321 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2p ] .",
    "the rapid rise in the very small @xmath12 region , down to @xmath322 or so , where sea quarks dominate , is well described by the qcd predictions and this rise is the direct extrapolation of what has been observed by ccfr for @xmath323 .",
    "we gave only these two examples for illustration , but these tests have been widely extended as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the large amount of available data on the unpolarized structure functions was also used to perform a global analysis by several authors@xcite and they all find for the parton densities a general pattern similar to the one displayed in fig .",

    "we now turn to some tests involving the polarized structure functions . as we have seen before",

    "i.e. _ @xmath326 . given the present accuracy of the data and the small @xmath2 range investigated so far , the @xmath2 evolution of @xmath327 predicted by qcd can not be tested at the level it was done for the unpolarized case .",
    "moreover this test depends on @xmath328 , for which only theoretical speculations can be made . in ref.@xcite , since the initial quark ( antiquark ) distributions are @xmath329 for each flavor @xmath137 , one gets immediately @xmath330 .",
    "therefore one can calculate consistently the @xmath331 s and the @xmath127 s structure functions , with no additional parameters and the agreement with the data is rather good@xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pparton ] a typical pattern of polarized parton distributions . @xmath332 and @xmath333 are rather well determined and they are consistent with the results shown in fig .",

    "we also see that @xmath334 is small and we find that @xmath199 , for @xmath335 are compatible with zero .",
    "the @xmath336 shown in the figure is one possible solution but it has large uncertainties .",
    "there are several other qcd analysis of the @xmath127s@xcite , where one relates the polarized parton distributions to the unpolarized ones with some additional parameters .",
    "these analysis conclude that @xmath305 is weakly constrained by present data and they all agree that a small @xmath305 is prefered .    finally let s say a few words on testing the first moment of @xmath127 , _",
    "i.e. _ the ejsr and the bsr .",
    "since data are obtained for each @xmath12 at a different @xmath2 , in order to have @xmath337 for a constant @xmath2 , one has to rely on the crucial hypothesis that the asymmetry @xmath112 ( see eq.([28 ] ) ) is @xmath2 independent , so the @xmath2 evolution of @xmath127 is driven by that of @xmath331 .",
    "moreover , the sum rules involve integrals from @xmath338 to @xmath339 and since there is no data at both ends , one has to make some reliable extrapolations in these two regions , low @xmath12 being the most critical one .",
    "the qpm results given in eqs.([55 ] ) and ( [ 56 ] ) are modified by qcd corrections , which have been calculated up to order @xmath340 . for example , in the gauge invariant factorization scheme , perturbative qcd corrections to @xmath341 lead to the following results@xcite : @xmath342 where @xmath343 the coefficients non - singlet @xmath344 and singlet @xmath345 are given by @xmath346 for three quarks flavors .",
    "the bsr becomes now @xmath347.\\ ] ] here we have neglected the theoretical uncertainties in the very low @xmath2 region due to the higher - twist effects which go like @xmath348 .",
    "the world data for the @xmath349 s show a defect in the ejsr for proton and deuterium both at @xmath350 from e143@xcite and @xmath351 from smc@xcite . from this one",
    "deduces also a defect for neutron , which was confirmed by the e154 result . if one combines the world data one finds for the bsr @xmath352 to be compared to the qcd prediction @xmath353 .",
    "one can also turn the argument around and given the experimental result , use the theoretical expression for the bsr to extract @xmath354@xcite .",
    "we also note that the defect in @xmath355 and @xmath356 are usually interpreted as being mainly due to a large and negative @xmath357 ( see eq.([56 ] ) ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath358 , but of course this does not necessarily holds if one considers @xmath140 symmetry breaking effects@xcite .",
    "the total contribution of the quark spins to the proton spin , is defined as @xmath359 . for @xmath360 ,",
    "the ellis - jaffe@xcite prediction gives @xmath361 , but according to all experiments , one gets a smaller value , for instance , e155 experiment@xcite has obtained @xmath362 at @xmath363 , which is not so easy to reconcile with our first intuition from the naive quark model , namely , @xmath364 .",
    "our knowledge of the unpolarized and polarized structure functions has improved considerably over the last twenty years or so and consequently also , our basic understanding of the proton structure .",
    "the enormous quantity of high statistics experimental data which is now available , allows us to make rather precise tests of the qcd parton model and this theoretical picture is nowdays established on very serious basis .",
    "deep inelastic phenomena is only one of the several areas of high energy particle physics which are the testing grounds of perturbative qcd and obviously , it has to be supplemented at least by electron - positron annihilation and hard hadron - hadron collisions@xcite .    for the unpolarized parton distributions , the flavor symmetry breaking of the sea quarks ( _ i.e. _ @xmath365 ) was only discovered recently with the violation of the gsr and it should be investigated more precisely for example in drell - yan lepton pair production or in @xmath366 production@xcite .",
    "our knowledge about the gluon distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ its small @xmath12 behavior and @xmath2 dependence , is improving but a real experimental effort remains to be done to put it on equal footing with the quark distributions .",
    "it requires , for example , better measurements of @xmath321 in the very small @xmath12 region and this makes hera - desy really exciting for the coming years .    concerning the polarized parton distributions significant progress",
    "have been made and we have now the following results .",
    "the violation of the ejsr is confirmed for the proton and for the neutron .",
    "the bsr is verified up to 10% and this important test must be strengthened at a higher level of accuracy .",
    "the kinematic domain presently accessible is still too limited to answer some important questions , in particular about the small @xmath12 behavior of @xmath127 , the @xmath2 evolution of the quark distributions and about the , so far , elusive @xmath328 .",
    "the perspective of having polarized protons at hera - desy , which is seriously envisaged@xcite , is opening a new experimental window for answering these questions .",
    "finally let us mention the very exciting spin physics programme which has been approved at rhic - bnl and will start operating by 2001 as a polarized @xmath367 collider@xcite . hopefully it will also shade some light on parton helicity distributions as well as quark transversity distributions .",
