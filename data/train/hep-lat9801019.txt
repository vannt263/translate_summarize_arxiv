    "studying the finite temperature phase transition of lattice qcd and the equation of state near this transition requires an understanding of the zero quark mass limit , where molecular dynamics methods fail completely @xcite . even at realistic values of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark masses",
    ", the dirac operator is nearly singular , and iterative methods for its inversion become extremely costly in computer time .",
    "for this reason , we modify the lattice qcd action by the addition of an irrelevant , chirally invariant 4-fermion interaction which renders the dirac operator non - singular , even when the quark mass is zero . because the extra interaction is irrelevant",
    ", such an action should lie in the same universality class as the standard action , and thus have the same continuum limit .",
    "the 4-fermion interaction we choose is of the gross - neveu , nambu - jona - lasinio form @xcite .",
    "ideally , such an interaction should be chosen to have the @xmath6 flavour symmetry of the original qcd action",
    ". however , we note that when one introduces auxiliary scalar and pseudoscalar fields to render this action quadratic in the fermion fields  which is necessary for lattice simulations ,  the fermion determinant is no longer real , even in the continuum limit .",
    "thus for 2 flavour qcd ( @xmath7 ) , we make a simpler choice and choose a 4-fermion term with the symmetry @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is generated by @xmath9 .",
    "the euclidean lagrangian density for this theory is then @xmath10 .",

    "brower et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested the addition of such chiral 4-fermion interactions to lattice qcd to control the singular nature of the zero mass dirac operator .",
    "in addition , 4-fermion terms arise in systematic attempts to improve the fermion lattice action to make it better approximate the continuum action @xcite .",
    "our work was suggested by earlier work by one of us on lattice field theories with quartic 4-fermion actions @xcite and by studies of the role such terms play in lattice qed .",
    "we have simulated this theory using 2 flavours of staggered quarks on @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattices , at an intermediate value of @xmath13 and zero quark mass , in order to determine the position and nature of the finite temperature transition .",
    "we also present some zero temperature results on an @xmath14 lattice , where we demonstrate that the theory with massless quarks does indeed have a massless goldstone pion .",
    "in addition to measuring the standard order parameters we have measured the pion , @xmath2(@xmath3 ) , and @xmath15 screening masses to probe the nature of chiral symmetry restoration at this transition .",
    "we also simulated the corresponding theory with 4-fermion couplings but no gauge interactions on relatively small lattices ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) to aid us in deciding what values of 4-fermion coupling constant to choose .    in section 2",

    "the `` dots '' represent derivatives with respect to molecular dynamics `` time '' as distinct from normal time . for the presentation of all our simulation results",
    "we use a time definition which is twice this , in order to be consistent with the convention used in the works of the hemcgc and htmcgc collaborations .",
    "we note that @xmath30 .",
    "although the determinant of @xmath31 does not appear to be real , it becomes so in the continuum limit . without the gauge fields , this theory reverts to the one studied in @xcite , with @xmath32 flavours .",
    "the advantage of this choice of the chiral 4-fermion interaction is that it preserves the axial @xmath33 chiral symmetry of the normal staggered quark lattice qcd action generated by @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "this means that , when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , the pion associated with @xmath36 will be a true goldstone boson and will be massless at @xmath35 , even for finite lattice spacing . under this exact chiral symmetry",

    "quarks the above lagrangian has an exact @xmath33 flavour axial symmetry .",
    "in order to ascertain which ranges of values of @xmath39 represent strong coupling and which represent weak coupling , we simulated the above lattice theory without the gluon fields where it becomes the lattice version of the nambu - jona - lasinio - gross - neveu model with @xmath40 flavours @xcite .",
    "we have simulated this theory with @xmath35 on @xmath16 and @xmath11 lattices .",
    "for these simulations , we ran for 5000 molecular - dynamics time units at each @xmath39 value with step size @xmath41 .",
    "this theory is known to have a phase transition , even at zero temperature , as a function of @xmath39 @xcite . for strong coupling ( small @xmath39 )",
    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , while at weak coupling ( large @xmath39 ) chiral symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "since the theory is strictly massless , the direction this axial symmetry is broken is arbitrary , and the chiral condensate is a linear combination of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( or @xmath2 and @xmath18 ) . because we work on finite lattices , the direction of this symmetry breaking does not remain constant , but rotates over the course of the run .",
    "for this reason , the order parameter we will denote by @xmath42 is actually the molecular - dynamics time average of @xmath44 , which differs from the true chiral condensate by terms @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the space - time volume of the lattice .",
    "this quantity is given in figure  [ fig : njlgn ] as a function of @xmath39 for both lattice sizes .    from the @xmath16 lattice",
    "we conclude that the zero temperature phase transition from the strong coupling phase to the weak coupling phase occurs somewhere in the range @xmath47 , while the finite temperature transition on the @xmath48 lattice occurs at a somewhat smaller value of @xmath39 .",
    "thus we would conclude that since , for lattice qcd with chiral 4-fermion interactions , we wish to work in the weak 4-fermion coupling regime , we should restrict ourselves to values of @xmath39 which are greater than 2 .",
    "moreover , since the introduction of this 4-fermion term produces chiral phase transitions where none previously existed , we could expect that chiral symmetry might be restored at a temperature higher than the deconfinement temperature . since this is not the case for normal lattice",
    "qcd , we should try to work at a large enough @xmath39 value that the 2 transitions are close , if not coincident .",
    "we describe studies to determine the appropriate range of @xmath39 values in section  5 .",
    "we have undertaken a preliminary investigation of the hadron spectrum of qcd with chiral 4-fermion interactions of the type discussed in section  2 on an @xmath14 lattice with 2 flavours of massless quarks at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 was chosen since it lies just below the phase transition for lattice qcd without the 4-fermion term on an @xmath52 lattice .",
    "thus we were assured of being in the confined phase .",
    "we used the hybrid molecular dynamics method with time increment @xmath41 for updating .",
    "we ran for a total of 5000 time units , discarding the first 1000 time units for equilibration .",
    "250 configurations spaced by 20 time units were saved for further analysis .",
    "the first 50 of these were discarded for equilibration .",
    "the pion and @xmath2 propagators were calculated from the correlations of the @xmath18 and @xmath2 fields , sampled every 2 time units . because , as was the case in the previous section , the direction of chiral symmetry breaking rotates during a run on a finite lattice , we chirally rotated each @xmath53 configuration ( see equation  [ eqn : chiral ] ) so that @xmath54 .",
    "the propagators are then given by @xmath55 where @xmath46 is the space - time and @xmath56 is the spatial volume of the lattice .",
    "correlated fits are made to these propagators , binning over 10 measurements ( 20 time units ) to account for correlations , and using jackknife to remove the vacuum expectation values in the @xmath2 propagator .",
    "the @xmath18 propagator was fitted to the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the lattice propagator for a massless scalar boson @xmath59 with the @xmath60 mode excluded .",
    "we found @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the fit from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "this fit has a 78% confidence level .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi ] shows the measured propagator with this fit superimposed . as indicated by the high confidence level , our measured pion propagator is very well fit by a massless scalar propagator , except at @xmath65 where we see the remnant of the original @xmath66-function interaction .",
    "thus the sum of fermion `` bubble '' diagrams has converted the auxilliary @xmath18 field to a true goldstone pion .",
    "for large @xmath67 the sigma propagator should behave as @xmath68                + b [ e^{-m_{\\pi_2 } t } + e^{-m_{\\pi_2 } ( n_t - t)}]\\ ] ] we have attempted such fits , but are unable to find a stable value for the @xmath69 mass . for this reason we resorted to the single particle fit obtained by setting @xmath70 to zero . here , our best fit yielded @xmath71 with a 51% confidence level .",
    "this mass was consistent with those obtained from the 2 particle fits .",
    "we have plotted our @xmath2 propagator and this fit in figure  [ fig : sigma ] .",
    "here it is clear why our fits were so poor  the propagator disolves into noise after only a few time - slices , which is the usual problem encountered when trying to calculate high mass propagators as in equation  [ eqn : sigma ] .",
    "( here the error in the propagator is expected to be independent of t , whereas for meson propagators calculated directly from the quark propagator , the error falls with increasing t ) .",
    "it is interesting to speculate as to whether the `` tail '' of this propagator is due to the 2-pion cut in the @xmath2 propagator .",
    "we have performed simulations on @xmath1 lattices and with 2 flavours of zero mass quarks , in order to study the transition from hadronic matter to a quark gluon plasma at finite temperature .",
    "our initial runs were performed on @xmath11 lattices with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 the time step @xmath41 for these runs .",
    "we experimented with values of @xmath75 from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , and found @xmath41 to be small enough that finite @xmath75 errors were smaller than statistical errors .",
    "we measured the wilson / polyakov line and the chiral condensate , @xmath42 , enabling us to determine the phase structure of the theory .",
    "since , as we have seen in section  3 , the presence of the 4-fermion coupling can break chiral symmetry , even at zero gauge coupling where there is no confinement , we expect that the chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement will in general occur at different values of @xmath78 .",
    "in fact for values of @xmath39 less than that for the transition at zero gauge coupling , chiral symmetry will always be broken . in figure",
    "[ fig : wil - psi ] we show the values of the 2 order parameters for each of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "it is clear at @xmath72 that the deconfinement transition , marked by the rapid increase in the wilson / polyakov line ( around @xmath79 ) , occurs at a much lower value of @xmath78 than the chiral symmetry restoration , marked by a drop in @xmath42 ( which does not reach zero for the reasons given in section  3 ) between @xmath80 and @xmath74 . at @xmath81",
    "the 2 transitions still appear to be distinct , although we can not rule out this being a finite volume effect , while at @xmath50 the 2 transitions appear to be coincident .",
    "since we are interested in obtaining results which are relevant to the continuum limit where the 4-fermion coupling vanishes and the 2 transitions _ are _ believed to be coincident , we chose to work at @xmath50 .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    \\(c ) ( d )    at @xmath50 , we observed signs of a two state signal in the time evolution of both order parameters at @xmath82 , indicating the possibility of a first order transition . figure  [ fig:533_8 ] shows the time evolution of the wilson / polyakov line at this @xmath78 value .",
    "thus we conclude that the transition occurs at @xmath83 on this size lattice . since the standard action shows a false first order transition on small lattices , we repeated our runs on a @xmath12 lattice .",
    "having @xmath84 enabled us to measure hadronic screening lengths in the @xmath85 direction .    on this larger lattice , we find evidence for 2-state signals at @xmath86 and @xmath82 . in figure",
    "[ fig : wilson ] we show the time evolution of the wilson / polyakov line for these 2 @xmath78 values . at @xmath86",
    "the wilson line measured from a cold start remains small for the total length of the run while that from a hot start , remains large for over 3000 time units before it tunnels rapidly to a low value and stays there . at @xmath82",
    "the wilson line from a hot start remains high for the entire run , while that from a cold start remains low for over 1500 time units before it tunnels rapidly to a high value and stays there .",
    "there is no sign of metastability for higher or lower @xmath78 values .",
    "we thus conclude that the transition occurs in the range @xmath87 , and probably closer to @xmath86 .",
    "the values of these quantities , @xmath88 and the average plaquette , @xmath89 are given in tables  [ tab : wilpsiapq8],[tab : wilpsiapq12 ] .",
    "we note that the required relationship @xmath90 is approximately true in the chirally broken phase , but that in the chirally symmetric phase it is somewhat less well obeyed .",
    "since the continuum values of both these quantities are zero in this symmetric phase , this suggests that the difference is in the @xmath91 departures of our estimators for these quantities from their true values , which do not have to obey this relationship .",

    "this helps substantiate our conclusion that the transition is first order . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of each of these quantities on either side of this transition is modest .",
    "the action for lattice qcd with 2 flavours of staggered quarks is modified by the addition of a chiral 4-fermion interaction .",
    "the chosen 4-fermion interaction has a @xmath113 symmetry , where @xmath119 is the normal @xmath6 chiral flavour symmetry of qcd with massless quarks .",
    "this irrelevant interaction alows us to simulate at zero quark mass by rendering the dirac operator non - singular .",
    "we have performed simulations at @xmath120 , a relatively weak value for the 4-fermion coupling , and zero quark mass at both zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the zero temperature calculation was performed on an @xmath14 lattice at @xmath49 , and was meant as a precurser to performing serious hadron spectroscopy with this action .",
    "our major result was clear evidence of a massless goldstone pion , the other hadrons having relatively large masses ( in lattice units ) for gauge couplings and hence lattice spacings this large .",
    "the effectiveness of the 4-fermion term in rendering the dirac operator non - singular is reflected in that the average number of conjugate gradient iterations required to invert the dirac operator was @xmath121 .    the finite temperature simulations were performed on @xmath12 and @xmath17 lattices .",
    "the finite temperature transition occured at @xmath122 , which is to be compared with @xmath123 , estimated for the massless quark extrapolation with the standard action @xcite .",
    "we have seen clear evidence that the transition is a strong first order transition . since we believe that the actual continuum transition should be second order ( or possibly weakly first order ) @xcite which is what simulations with the standard action suggest @xcite , we believe this to be due to the size of the 4-fermion interaction , enhanced by the strength of the gauge coupling . again",
    "the condition of the dirac operator was well under control , it requiring @xmath124 conjugate gradient iterations , on average , to invert this operator throughout the range of @xmath78 s considered .",
    "we are now running at @xmath1 with @xmath125 , and @xmath126 with @xmath50 and @xmath125 .",
    "preliminary results at @xmath126 suggest a second order transition at @xmath50 , which is even clearer at @xmath125 .",
    "it is still too early to draw any conclusions from the ongoing runs at @xmath1 , @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath2 screening masses showed the appropriate behaviour .",
    "the goldstone pion mass remained zero below the transition , and increased from zero after the transition .",
    "the @xmath2 mass dipped as the transition was approached from below ( it is not clear whether it actually approached zero on the cold side of the transition ) , and rose , apparently from zero , above the transition where it was degenerate with the pion mass .",
    "the other screening masses remained large across the transition .",
    "in particular the connected part of the @xmath2 propagator , the @xmath127 ramained large over this region . however , flavour symmetry violation is large enough at these @xmath78 and @xmath39 values that it is not clear whether this is further evidence that the flavour singlet @xmath128 symmetry remains broken across the transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "if our thermodynamics simulations at larger @xmath129 and/or @xmath39 do indicate a second order transition , we should be able to determine the universality class of this transition and the critical indices , enabling us to determine the equation of state of hadronic matter .",
    "with still larger @xmath129 we should be able to measure asymptotic scaling and determine the position , as well as nature of the phase transition . at zero temperature",
    "we should be able to obtain the hadronic spectrum , first at zero mass and then at the physical quark masses _ without _ having to perform an extrapolation in quark mass .",
    "we are investigating how one might overcome the difficulties with simulating with a 4-fermion term having the more physical @xmath119 chiral symmetry , and perhaps @xmath130 chiral symmetry .",
    "in addition we will investigate combining this improvement to the standard lattice qcd action with the improvements of lepage _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , or of the `` perfect action '' methods @xcite .",
    "preliminary results of these simulations were reported at lattice97 @xcite .",
    "these computations were performed on the cray c-90 at nersc .",
