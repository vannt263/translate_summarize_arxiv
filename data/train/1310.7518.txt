    "localization of waves is an intriguing physical phenomenon that can be encountered in many fields of physics .",
    "anderson localization @xcite of the charge carriers in mesoscopic conductors leads to an exponentially decreasing conductance with sample length , a phenomenon that may be encountered in sufficiently phase - coherent nanomaterials , such as graphene or carbon nanotubes . in graphene , the phase - coherence length can reach several microns at low temperatures,@xcite and due to the large length scales involved , computational simulation of localization is often challenging .",
    "there are two main numerical methods for studying electronic transport at the quantum level , namely , the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite and kubo - greenwood ( kg ) method.@xcite in the landauer - bttiker formalism , one studies a system connected to two or multiple terminals , and relates the conductance of the system to the probabilities of the charge carriers to transmit from one terminal to another .",
    "the transmission probabilities can be evaluated using green s function techniques , with the recursive green s function ( rgf ) technique being the numerically most efficient implementation for a two - terminal system . however , although the computational effort scales linearly with the length of the system , it scales cubically with the width of the system . on the other hand , in the tight - binding approximation , the ( real - space ) kg method @xcite",
    "can be implemented so that the computational effort scales linearly with the total number of atoms in the system , which enables the study of much wider systems .",
    "although it can not take into account effects that occur due to contacts or contact - device interfaces , the kg method is in principle very suitable for obtaining intrinsic diffusive transport properties of the device , such as conductivity and mean free path .",
    "both the rgf and kg methods have been widely used to study electronic transport in disordered graphene in the diffusive transport regime , while most direct studies of the localized regime have utilized the rgf formalism .",
    "@xcite the main difficulty of using the kg method in the localized regime is a lack of a length scale , which is crucial for characterizing the scaling behavior of conductance .",
    "this makes the original kg formula not very suitable for studying mesoscopic transport , while a ` mesoscopic kg formula ' @xcite was found to be equivalent to the rgf formalism .",
    "however , it has been realized recently that a definition of length is possible by recasting the kg formula into a time - dependent einstein formula,@xcite in which the conductivity is expressed as a time - derivative of the mean square displacement ( msd ) .",
    "this enables one to define a length in terms of the square root of the msd , which has a clear interpretation in the ballistic regime .",
    "the possibility of defining a length combined with the linear - scaling techniques developed in the kg formalism , which still lack successful counterparts in the rgf formalism , makes the kg method very promising for simulating electronic transport in realistically - sized graphene - based systems .",
    "however , the relationship between the kg and the rgf methods in the localized regime has not been exactly determined .",
    "so far , it is known that the msd given by the kg method will saturate to a finite value , thought to equal the localization length.@xcite on the other hand , before this saturation there is a regime where the conductance given by the kg method decays exponentially , roughly equaling the conductance given by the rgf method.@xcite    in this paper , we present methods to obtain the localization properties of a mesoscopic conductor using the kg method , using a hexagonal graphene lattice as a testbed . in the localized transport regime ,",
    "the conductance decreases exponentially with the length of the conductor , with the exponential decrease being quantified by the localization length @xmath0 .",
    "thus , one may perform an exponential fit to the simulated conductance to obtain @xmath0 , which is indeed a standard way to find @xmath0 using the rgf method .",
    "thus , we first compare the conductance given by the kg method with the one acquired using the rgf method , and establish how an accurate correspondence between the results from these two methods can be achieved , before the saturation of the msd . however , the selection of the fitting region to obtain @xmath0 is not completely unambiguous when the kg method is used . we find a direct relation between the converged value of the msd and the localization length , which provides a numerically more efficient and accurate method to obtain @xmath0 . using a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) @xcite to perform the kg simulations",
    ", we are able to reach the localized regime and the saturation of the msd without especially time - consuming computations .",
    "as a model system , we have chosen graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) with vacancy - type defects , modeled by randomly removing carbon atoms according to a prescribed defect concentration , which is defined to be the number of vacancies divided by the number of carbon atoms in the pristine system .",
    "our calculations are performed in both armchair and zigzag edged graphene nanoribbons ( agnrs and zgnrs , respectively ) , both in the quasi-1d region , where the width @xmath1 and in the effectively 2d region , where @xmath2 , as well as in the transitional region .",
    "an agnr with @xmath3 dimer lines along the zigzag edge and a zgnr with @xmath4 zigzag - shaped chains across the armchair edge are abbreviated as @xmath3-agnr and @xmath4-zgnr , respectively .",
    "the carbon - carbon distance is chosen to be 0.142 nm .",
    "we use the nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation to obtain the hamiltonian @xmath5 of the system , which gives in the notion of second quantization @xmath6 where the hopping parameter @xmath7 is set to @xmath8 ev and the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "spin degeneracy is assumed .    in the time - dependent einstein formula @xcite derived from the kg formula , the zero - temperature electrical conductivity at fermi energy @xmath9 and correlation time @xmath10",
    "may be obtained as a time - derivative of the msd @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 } { \\textmd{tr}\\left[\\delta(e - h)\\right ] } , \\label{msd}\\ ] ] @xmath14 being the position operator @xmath15 in the heisenberg representation , and @xmath16 \\label{dos}\\ ] ] is the density of states ( dos ) with spin degeneracy included .",
    "the factor of 2 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ equation : rec ] ) should be there to make this equation consistent with the original kg formula .",
    "also , except for pure diffusive transport , the time - derivative in this equation can not be substituted by a time - division . for a three - dimensional system",
    ", @xmath17 is the volume of the system .",
    "however , for both quasi-1d gnrs and truly 2d graphene , we can simply omit the dimension perpendicular to the basal plane and take @xmath17 as the area of graphene sheet . as a result , the conductivity has the same dimensionality as the conductance .",

    "one may note that the quantity calculated by eq .",
    "( [ equation : rec ] ) is the conductivity .",

    "fortunately , there exists a definition of length in terms of the msd , @xmath19 which enables converting conductivity to conductance : @xmath20 the conductance defined in this way corresponds exactly to the two - terminal conductance for a ballistic conductor , apart from some numerical problems around the van hove singularities @xcite . in general",
    ", @xmath21 is length - dependent and it is one of our purposes to find out how accurate correspondence between independent rgf calculations can be achieved by using the above two definitions given by eqs .",

    "( [ equation : length_definition ] ) has been justified in ref . .",
    "intuitively , it means that @xmath22 equals the diffusion length only in one transport direction , and the factor of 2 accounts for the opposite direction .",
    "we further note that in the purely ballistic regime , this definition of length leads to a length - independent conductance can be derived as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the fermi velocity , which is equivalent to the textbook formula.@xcite the factor of 2 in this textbook formula has a similar meaning : only half of the carriers at the fermi energy move along transport direction . remarkably , the conductance calculated by eq .",
    "( [ equation : g ] ) does give the correct results for quasi-1d ballistic conductors , except for some numerical inaccuracies around the van hove singularities .",
    "@xcite we stress that the length defined in eq .",
    "( [ equation : length_definition ] ) is the propagating length of electrons , rather than the length of the cell used in a specific simulation .",
    "the simulation cell only needs to be sufficiently large to eliminate finite - size effects resulted from the discreteness of the spectrum of a finite system .    in the rgf",

    "the fermi energy @xmath28 of the leads can be set to the same value as in the device , @xmath9 , or to an arbitrary value . in this work",
    ", we set it either to @xmath9 or to a value of 1.5 ev , where the latter value is used to simulate metallic contacts with a high number of propagating modes .",
    "the self energy matrices may be obtained through different methods , e.g. , using an iterative scheme.@xcite the matrices @xmath29 , that describe the coupling to the leads , are obtained from @xmath30,\\ ] ] and the conductance is then computed using @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the quantum of conductance .",
    "the conductance of a mesoscopic system depends on the exact configuration of disorder .",
    "this effect is especially significant in the localized regime , where variations in the disorder configuration give rise to conductance fluctuations of several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus the conductance and the dos are not uniquely determined by the defect concentration , and methods for ensemble averaging are required . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the distribution of the conductance values is roughly normal , and arithmetic averaging is the preferred method . on the other hand , in the localized regime",
    "the conductance values tend toward a log - normal distribution .",
    "thus , in the localized regime the typical value of the distribution , defined as @xmath33 , describes the ensemble in a statistically meaningful way.@xcite    in the rgf formalism the average and typical conductances are straightforward to obtain , but one has to note that in the localized regime a much larger ensemble is required for obtaining an accurate value of the average conductance . on the other hand , when computing the conductance using the kg method , the trace operations of eqs .",
    "( [ msd ] ) and ( [ dos ] ) correspond to arithmetic averaging .",
    "in order to be able to obtain typical values for the conductance and dos using the kg formalism , we have defined @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a wave function located at site @xmath37 .",
    "thus by varying @xmath37 and the defect configuration , we obtain an ensemble of values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the ensemble is represented by the average values @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as well as by the typical values @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus when utilizing the kg method , we obtain the average and typical conductances from @xmath44 where the length @xmath45 is obtained from the expression @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "and the ensemble size is 10000 . ]     and the ensemble size is 10000 . ]    when the length of the system is much larger than @xmath0 , the conductance decays exponentially .",
    "early work by landauer @xcite showed that @xmath48 decays as @xmath49 , whereas anderson _",
    "_ @xcite noted that @xmath50 decays faster , i.e. as @xmath51 .",
    "let us first study the conductance far away from the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , with the number of propagating modes being large in this region .",
    "we compute the average and typical conductances using both the rgf and kg methods , obtaining the conductance from eq .",
    "( [ rec_ens ] ) in the latter case . in both methods",
    ", we have obtained the values from ensembles of 10000 random defect configurations , and the simulation cell is set to be about 200 nm long in the kg simulations .",
    "the vacancy concentration is set to 1% .",
    "figures [ g_comp](a ) and ( b ) show a direct comparison between results from the rgf and kg methods in the localized regime , for a 65-agnr at @xmath52 ev and @xmath53 ev , respectively . as the msd finally reaches an upper bound , the conductivity given by eq .",
    "( [ equation : rec ] ) drops eventually to zero super - exponentially.@xcite before the super - exponential decay of the conductance , both the typical and the average conductances given by the kg method decrease exponentially and in good agreement with the corresponding values given by the rgf method . from the slopes of the typical conductances ,",
    "the localization lengths can be obtained as roughly 8 nm at @xmath52 ev and 5 nm at @xmath53 ev .",
    "thus it can be seen that the regime where @xmath50 , given by the kg method , decays exponentially extends roughly to four times @xmath54 , with @xmath48 exhibiting a somewhat shorter regime of exponential decay .    at energies closer to the cnp , a clear discrepancy between results from the two methods rises , as shown in figs .",
