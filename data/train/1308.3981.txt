    "a number of interesting dynamical phenomena can occur in optical systems with nonlinear feedback .",
    "such systems , typically nonlinear cavities , can , within a certain range of input optical power , exhibit optical bistability ( or even multistability ) , a phenomenon which is expected to play an important role in data processing applications . with a further increase of power , the systems may exhibit generation of optical pulses from continuous wave input ( self - pulsing ) and chaos . the nonlinearity is often provided by the kerr effect , in which the intensity of propagating light alters the refractive index of the medium .",
    "the chaotic behavior is related to the instability that was first investigated by ikeda @xcite in a single ring resonator . under suitable conditions ,",
    "namely for the finite relaxation time of the nonlinear response , the ikeda instability can lead to self - pulsing ( sp ) @xcite .",
    "these predictions were experimentally confirmed with a hybrid optically bistable device @xcite .",
    "similar effects were found in a nonlinear fabry - perot resonators @xcite and distributed feedback structures @xcite .",
    "the impact of the relaxation time was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite    other nonlinear mechanisms can also induce the mentioned effects .",
    "for various types of optical microcavities , e.g. , silicon microring resonators , the nonlinear effect is not only provided by the kerr effect but also by the free carrier absorption ( fca ) and free carrier dispersion ( fcd ) through the two - photon absorption ( tpa ) effect @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that nonlinear effects are enhanced in coupled - cavity systems @xcite .",
    "coupled cavities with instantaneous kerr response exhibit rich dynamics and offer more control over nonlinear switching , sp and chaos @xcite .",
    "in particular , sp and chaos were observed in systems with two and three coupled microcavities @xcite . for two - cavity systems ,",
    "sp can be explained as a result of beating of modes and bistable switching @xcite .",
    "however , sp can also be related to gap solitons @xcite . for long microring chains , spontaneous generation of gap solitons from cw input",
    "was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on simulation of coupled ring resonators . compared with the publications regarding coupled - cavity systems , we take into account non - instantaneous kerr response .",
    "we also introduce the effect of loss which has not been considered in such systems so far .",
    "often , the simulation of nonlinear cavities is performed by coupled mode theory in time @xcite .",
    "the technique can treat different kinds of cavities in the same manner .",
    "however , its validity is limited to the case of weak coupling @xcite .",
    "here we describe an alternative approach that can be used for ring resonators .",
    "we generalize the map presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and obtain a system of difference - differential equations .",
    "we formulate an efficient numerical technique for the solution of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ tech ] , we introduce the model and theoretical formulation . in section",
    "[ results ] , we demonstrate the technique by presenting the dynamical behavior of a system with two rings . the effect of loss as well as the effect of instantaneous and non - instantaneous kerr response is also presented .",

    "similarly as in @xcite , we assume that the coupling is lossless and localized at a single point . then , by using the notation in fig",
    ". 1 , the interaction in each coupler ( in time @xmath6 ) is given by @xmath7 @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 ) , are respectively the coupling and transmission coefficients which describe each coupler @xcite .",
    "the structure exhibits kerr nonlinearity , i.e. , in the stationary state , the nonlinear change of the effective mode index at a certain position in the ring ( or waveguide ) is given by the relation of type @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the effective nonlinear kerr - index ( it is assumed to be constant in all rings / waveguides ) and @xmath14 is the physical amplitude of the mode at this position .",
    "however , instead of @xmath14 we use the dimensionless amplitude @xmath1 defined by the relation @xmath15 , where @xmath16/\\alpha$ ] is the effective length , @xmath17 is the waveguide loss coefficient ( it includes all possible linear loss mechanisms , such as material absorption or scattering ) , @xmath18 is the half of the ring circumference , and @xmath19 is the wavelength of the light in vacuum .",

    ", the powers are directly related to the physical amplitudes and can also be used as a measure of nonlinearity strength .    optical pulse propagation in a nonlinear dispersive media is well - described by maxwell s equations @xcite taking into consideration nonlinear polarization and applying the slowly - varying - envelope approximation . in the presence of kerr - nonlinearity and waveguide loss , the relations between mode amplitudes in fig .",

    "( [ eq : alp_dim_1]-[eq : alp_delay_2 ] ) , we assume no signal at the add port , @xmath5 , and arbitrarily choose the amplitude at the drop port @xmath45 . then , the other amplitudes are calculated step by step with using eqs .",
