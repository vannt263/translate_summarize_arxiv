    "in the last few years an increasing bulk of data have been accumulated favouring the scenario of a spatially flat universe dominated by some form of dark energy . a first strong evidence came from the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( hereafter sneia ) that turned out to be best fitted by spatially flat accelerating cosmological models including a non trivial component @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the results from the observed first and second peak in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( hereafter cmbr ) spectrum strongly suggested that the geometry of the universe is spatially flat @xcite . when combined with the data on the matter density parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "these results lead to the conclusion that the contribution @xmath1 of the dark energy is the dominant one , being @xmath2 .",
    "this picture of the universe has been further strengthened by an increasing sample of high redshift sneia @xcite and most precise and extended measurements of the cmbr spectrum @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of these evidences of a spatially flat and accelerating universe , an overwhelming flood of papers , presenting a great variety of models for the explanation of this phenomenon , has appeared .",
    "the simplest explanation is the cosmological constant @xcite which is able to fit the sneia data with good confidence , but it is also plagued by many problems on different scales .",
    "this situation has strongly encouraged the search for alternative approaches which now ranges from minimal coupled scalar fields , to strings and anthropic principle ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "some of us have introduced a new approach to the problem modifying the usual equation of state of the cosmological fluid in order to see whether going further than the standard approximation of cosmological perfect fluid allows to reproduce the available data .",
    "the authors have considered a standard cosmology with a van der waals equation of state for matter without any other kind of energy source .",
    "this approach is extremely `` natural '' and `` obvious '' since it starts from the consideration that the universe , in its evolution , is not always well described by a perfect fluid in the forms of radiation or non - interacting dust . in our opinion , before adding an exotic and mysterious dark energy into the cosmic pie , it is worth wondering whether the observed acceleration of the universe can be implemented using the minimal number of fluids .",
    "the price to pay is taking into account a more complicated equation of state and motivate it physically . from elementary thermodynamics , we know that a real fluid is never perfect @xcite . moreover , it is also well known that the perfect fluid equation of state @xmath3 with @xmath4 is just a rough approximation of cosmic epochs capable of describing stationary situations where phase transitions ( e.g. , from radiation dominated to dust dominated regions ) are not considered @xcite . on the other hand , the only thing we know about dark energy is that it gives rise to an accelerated expansion , but there are no hints about its nature . due to this situation ,",
    "it is worth asking whether dark energy is indeed needed or , on the contrary , the observed acceleration is driven by standard dark matter provided that its equation of state is more realistically treated .",
    "a van der waals fluid could be a first step toward the goal to get a whole dynamics where _ 1 . ) _ only observed fluids are taken into account , _ 2 . )",
    "_ phase transitions occur in the framework of the same evolution , _ 3 . ) _ accelerated and decelerated periods depend on the relative values of the parameters of the state equation with respect to the pressure and matter energy density which are functions of time .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar approach has yet been explored in @xcite where the author considers a mixture of two fluids , using the perfect gas equation of state for the matter and the van der waals one for the dark energy .",
    "however , our approach is radically different since the model we consider is made out of matter only .",
    "is is worth noting that the term _",
    "_ usually refers to both baryons and dark matter and both these substances are described by the same equation of state .",
    "actually , we have a direct knowledge of the properties of baryons only and indeed their equation of state is well described ( on cosmological scales ) by the dust approximation . on the opposite",
    ", the nature of the dark matter is still completely unknown so that , a priori , nothing prevents us from exploring the possibility that its properties call for a more general equation of state such as the van der waals one .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to explore further this approach in order to see whether a cosmological fluid with van der waals state equation can be reconciled with observations .",
    "we have thus constrained the effective parameters of the theory looking for cosmological models which : @xmath5 can admit a nowaday accelerating universe ; @xmath6 satisfy the constraints on the estimated age of the universe , @xmath7 are able to fit the data on the dimensionless coordinate distance to sneia and radio galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we briefly summarize the main features of van der waals equation of state and choose the set of parameters which are best suited to assign the model .",
    "dynamics of the model is described in sect.3 where we determine the evolution of the energy density , the hubble parameter and the scale factor . matching with observations",
    "is performed in sect.4 where the data on the dimensionless coordinate distance to sneia and radio galaxies are used to select among the models . in sect.5",
    ", we compare the model prediction for the age of the universe with the estimated one , while , in sect.6 , we evaluate the position of the first three peaks of the cmbr anisotropy spectrum and qualitatively speculate on how structure formation could take place in the van der waals quintessence scenario .",
    "sect.7 is then devoted to the discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "the dynamical system describing a friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) cosmology is given by the friedmann equations @xcite :    @xmath8    @xmath9    and the continuity equations for each of the two fluids :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter , the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time and @xmath12 is the spatial curvature constant respectively for open , flat and closed universes .",
    "eqs.([eq : fried1 ] ) , ( [ eq : fried2 ] ) and ( [ eq : continuity ] ) are derived by the einstein field equations and the contracted bianchi identities assuming that the source of the gravitational field is a a mixture of baryons with energy density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 and dark matter with energy density @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16 . to close the system and determine the evolution of the scale factor @xmath17 and of the other quantities of interest , the equation of state of the dark matter fluid ( i.e. a relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 )",
    "is needed .    in the standard cosmology",
    ", one assumes that the dark matter may be described as a perfect fluid so that the equation of state is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so called zeldovich interval .",
    "however , this is only an approximation which is not always valid and which does not describe the phase transitions between the successive thermodynamic state of the cosmic fluid .",
    "several times , for instance at equivalence , two phases had to exist together . in these cases ,",
    "a simple description by a perfect fluid equation of state is not realistic .",
    "an immediate generalization can be achieved by taking into account the van der waals equation of state which describes a two phase fluid .",
    "also in this case , we have an approximation , but the consequences on dynamics are interesting @xcite . hence we assume that the equation of state is :    @xmath20    which reduces to the perfect fluid case in the limit @xmath21 . hereafter , we will denote with the subscript _ b _ ( _ vdw _ ) all the quantities referring to the baryons ( the van der waals dark matter ) . in standard units ,",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 coefficients may be rewritten as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the density and the pressure of the cosmic fluid at the van der waals critical point .",
    "the critical values are the indications that the cosmic fluid changes its phase at certain thermodynamic conditions . as a consequence ,",
    "the three parameters @xmath27 are not independent from each other .",
    "inserting eq.([eq : alphabeta ] ) into eq.([eq : vdweq ] ) and considering the situation at the critical point , one gets :    @xmath28    so that the number of independent parameters is now reduced to two , which are @xmath29 .",
    "using eq.([eq : pcrhoc ] ) we may rewrite eq.([eq : vdweq ] ) as :    @xmath30    having defined the dimensionless energy density @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that :    @xmath32    as we know , observations tell us that we are living in a phase of accelerated expansion so that today the leading pressure must be negative .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath33 so that the pressure is positive ( almost vanishing ) in the limit @xmath34 and negative in the opposite limit @xmath35 .",
    "this simple consideration suggests us that models with @xmath33 could have some chance to reproduce the observed data provided that the present day energy density of the dark matter is much larger than the van der waals critical energy density , i.e. it should be @xmath36 where hereon all quantities with a subscript 0 are evaluated today ( i.e. at @xmath37 . on the other hand , models with @xmath38 have a negative pressure in the limit @xmath39 and a positive ( and large ) one in the limit @xmath40",
    "we may thus conclude that , in order to give an accelerated expansion today , @xmath41 must be much smaller than 1 for models with @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth noting that these conclusions have been obtained without the need to solve the friedmann equations .",
    "data on the cmbr anisotropy spectrum strongly suggest that the universe is spatially flat today @xcite so that we will assume @xmath42 in the rest of the paper . in this case , evaluating eq.([eq : fried1 ] ) at @xmath43 , we get :    @xmath44    with :    @xmath45    with @xmath46 and @xmath47 the critical density of the universe .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that eq.([eq : ocob ] ) is a consequence of the assumption that there is only a single fluid other than baryons filling the spatially flat universe and playing the role of both dark matter and dark energy . from this point of view",
    ", van der waals quintessence may be considered in the framework of unified dark energy models such as the chaplygin gas @xcite and the hobbit models @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a significant difference .",
    "the van der waals equation of state does not interpolate between a dust like pressure and a constant negative one as @xmath48 evolves .",
    "indeed , for models with @xmath33 the pressure becomes quite small for @xmath39 , but it is not zero . on the other hand , when @xmath38 , the pressure becomes quite small and negative , but still remains different from zero .",
    "it is worth noting that it is possible to start narrowing the class of models to explore without the need to explicitly solve the friedmann equations . to this aim ,",
    "let us consider the deceleration parameter :    @xmath49    where we have combined eqs.([eq : fried1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fried2 ] ) . inserting eq.([eq : vdwour ] ) into eq.([eq : defq ] ) , evaluating the result at the present day and solving with respect to @xmath50 , we get :    @xmath51    since @xmath52 , the denominator is always positive so that @xmath50 is consistently defined by eq.([eq : gammavsqz ] ) .",
    "we may thus use @xmath53 as a parameter instead of @xmath50 and characterize the models by the three parameters @xmath54 where we use the logarithm of @xmath41 instead of @xmath41 itself for reasons that will be clear later .",
    "it is worth noting that using @xmath53 instead of @xmath50 allows to select immediately nowadays accelerating models .",
    "moreover , it is easier to choose a range for @xmath53 than for @xmath50 that is _ a priori _ completely unknown . actually , there is a third parameter that has to be given to completely assign the model and study its dynamics .",
    "this is the hubble constant @xmath55 which , however , we will consider as a known quantity .",
    "we will explain later why this assumption is necessary and why , nonetheless , it does not introduce any loss of generality .    finally , let us observe that there is another interesting quantity that may be evaluated without the need of solving the friedmann equations . by definition",
    ", the barotropic factor @xmath56 of the van der waals fluid is given as :    @xmath57    using eq.([eq : gammavsqz ] ) and evaluating the result at the present day , we get :    @xmath58    for accelerating models ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 takes on negative values and may also be lower than -1 thus suggesting that phantom models ( that are indeed characterized by negative pressure fluids with @xmath61 ) could be somewhat confused with van der waals quintessence .     and",
    "three different values of @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 ( short dashed ) , @xmath64 ( solid ) and @xmath65 ( long dashed ) .",
    "we use @xmath66 to get @xmath67 from @xmath62 . ]",
    "having described the general features of the model , let us now determine the dynamics of the universe , i.e. let us investigate how the relevant physical quantities ( scale factor , energy densities and hubble parameter ) evolve . as a preliminary step ,",
    "let us remember that , solving the continuity equations for baryons , we get :    @xmath68    with @xmath69 the redshift . to solve the continuity equation for the van der waals dark matter , it is convenient to change variable from the cosmic time @xmath70 to the redshift @xmath71 and to use the dimensionless energy density @xmath72 .",
    "we thus get :    @xmath73}{8 ( 1 + z ) ( 3 - \\eta ) } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : etavsz}\\ ] ]    this is a first order nonlinear differential equation for @xmath74 which may be numerically solved provided that the three parameters @xmath54 are given .",
    "it is worth stressing that , although not explicitly present , the parameter @xmath67 enters eq.([eq : etavsz ] ) through @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , being eq.([eq : etavsz ] ) nonlinear , a sort of _ butterfly effect _ takes place with the result that also small changes in the baryons content lead to significantly different evolutions of the the energy density of the van der waals dark matter with the redshift @xmath71 .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.[fig : ez ] where we plot @xmath75 for a particular choice of @xmath76 and three different values of @xmath62 . comparing the short dashed line ( corresponding to a model with no baryons ) with the other two",
    ", we may safely conclude that , although the present day baryon density parameter is quite small ( @xmath77 ) , it can not be neglected without introducing a severe bias in the past ( @xmath78 ) evolution of the van der waals energy density as the ratio between the van der waals energy density and the present day critical density @xmath47 .",
    "it is thus not surprising that @xmath79 gets larger than 1 even if the universe is assumed to be spatially flat . ] .",
    "this is also evident considering the the hubble parameter .",
    "while , for @xmath80 , there is essentially no difference at all among models having the same values of @xmath76 but different baryon content , the dependence on @xmath67 is more and more important going back in time , i.e. to higher redshifts .",
    "in particular , we note that , for a given @xmath71 , the higher is @xmath67 , the larger is @xmath81 , i.e. models with higher baryons content evolve faster .",
    "it is worth noting that these results do not depend on the values of the parameters @xmath76 that only determine when the effect of @xmath67 becomes important .",
    "for the same models considered in fig.[fig : ez ] . ]    a striking feature of fig.[fig : ez ] is the flattening of @xmath79 towards a constant value suggesting that the van der waals fluid mimics a cosmological constant term in the past . *",
    "it is worth stressing that this behaviour does not depend on the particular choice of the parameters @xmath76 , but is rahter a characteristic feature of the van der waals fluid .",
    "however , the lower is the value of @xmath82 , the higher is the redshift @xmath71 when @xmath79 becomes constant .",
    "although quite peculiar , this result may be easily explained considering the evolution of the barotropic factor @xmath56 .",
    "as an example , fig.[fig : wz ] shows @xmath56 for the same models considered in fig.[fig : ez ] .",
    "first , we note that the effect of @xmath67 is negligible ( for realistic values of this quantity ) in agreement with what is predicted for @xmath60 by eq.([eq : wzqz ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 quickly converges to @xmath83 so that the van der waals fluid behaves as the cosmological constant in the past . changing the values of the parameters @xmath76 have the only effect of increasing or decreasing the rate of convergence , but not the asymptotic limit of @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , implicitly defining @xmath84 as @xmath85 , it is possible to show that @xmath84 is a decreasing function of @xmath82 , while it depends only weakly on @xmath53 . since @xmath79 becomes constant for @xmath86 , this explains why the energy density of the van der waals fluid becomes flat in fig.[fig : ez ] for higher values of @xmath71 as @xmath82 decreases .",
    "we may thus conclude that the van der waals fluid behaves as the cosmological constant at high redshift whatever are the values of the parameters @xmath54 .",
    "* this important result will have profound impact on the evaluation of the positions of the peaks of the cmbr anisotropy spectrum as we will discuss later in sect.6 .    having determined @xmath81 , it is straightforward to estimate the age of the universe at redshift @xmath71 as :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the hubble time ( being @xmath89 the hubble constant in units of @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 . the present age of the universe is then @xmath92 .",

    "]    it turns out that neglecting baryons leads to a strong error in the determination of the scale factor and thus on the age of the universe . the _ butterfly effect _ here works quite hard .",
    "actually , it is worth noting that the shape of @xmath94 does not depend strongly on the exact value of @xmath67 as could be inferred comparing the solid and long dashed lines in fig.[fig : at ] .",
    "doubling @xmath67 does not change significantly @xmath96 so that we may conclude that what is important is to take into account the presence of baryons , but not the precise value of their density parameter ( unless we take completely unrealistic values ) .",

    "@xcite so that we are confident not to be excluding interesting models .    given @xmath76 , the predicted age of the universe for the corresponding van der waals model may be estimated setting @xmath43 in eq.([eq : age ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig : agefig ] shows the age contours in the @xmath76 plane for the model with @xmath143 set as discussed above .",
    "note that we have greatly enlarged the range for @xmath82 in order to explore with much detail this poorly constrained parameter .",
    "the results of the age test are somewhat surprising .",
    "first , positive values of @xmath82 are strongly excluded since they give rise to values of @xmath136 of the order of hundreds of gyr in striking disagreement with eq.([ageconstr ] ) . furthermore , the age test also cuts away a large part of the range for @xmath53 accepting only models with @xmath144 .",
    "roughly , we can summarize the results of this test giving the following constraints :    @xmath145    note that this is actually a little bit larger than the region delimited by the dashed line in fig.[fig : agefig ] since we have approximated it as a rectangular one , while it is not .",
    "however , this simplification will not alter our main results .",
    "note that , for the model parameters in the range ( [ eq : rangetime ] ) , @xmath146 with @xmath38 so that the van der waals fluid behaves essentially as a perfect fluid with negative pressure .    * comparing eq.([eq : rangetime ] ) with the constraints ( 20 ) from the fit to the dimensionless coordinate distance shows that the two ranges have a good overlap in @xmath82 at 95@xmath130 cl , but the constraints on @xmath53 are marginally consistent only at the 95@xmath130 cl .",
    "* moreover , all the allowed models predict values of @xmath136 close the upper end in eq.([ageconstr ] ) .",
    "one should thus conclude that , in order to reconcile van der waals quintessence with both the sneia and radiogalaxies distance data and the age of the universe , a certain degree of fine tuning of the parameters is needed .",
    "although this is not a problem in its own , it is worth noting that the van der waals equation of state is only an approximation to the actual unknown equation of state of the dark matter component which is likely to be valid only over a limited range of the evolution history of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed knowledge of the dark matter thermodynamical properties and of their possible dependence on @xmath71 is completely lacking so that it is impossible to say what is the redshift range over which eq.([eq : vdwour ] ) holds . this systematic error does not affect the fit to the dimensionless coordinate distance since this test only probes a limited and nearby redshift range , but could have a profound impact on the estimate of @xmath136 since this latter depends on the full evolutionary history . as a consequence",
    ", we do not consider as a serious shortcoming the only marginal agreement of predicted and estimated age of the universe for the van der waals models selected by the fit to the sneia and radiogalaxies dimensionless coordinate distances data .",
    "the cosmological model we have discussed insofar is made out of matter only , but we have made a clear separation between the baryons and dark matter . while the former is still described as dust matter , the equation of state of the latter is the van der waals one so that the properties of the dark matter in this scenario are radically different from that of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "indeed , while for cdm it is @xmath147 at all @xmath71 , for the van der waals dark matter @xmath148 depends on @xmath71 and quickly approaches the value @xmath149 as shown in fig.[fig : wz ] .",
    "it thus makes sense to ask how structure formation evolves in the scheme we are proposing .",
    "this is a quite complicated task and will be addressed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "nonetheless , here we give some qualitative comments to illustrate the subtleties of this topic .    as a first remark ,",
    "let us remember that structure formation may efficiently take place only during a decelerating phase of the universe evolution .",
    "moreover , the sneia hubble diagram shows some evidences of a transition from acceleration to deceleration although the estimate of the transition redshift @xmath150 ( defined so that @xmath151 ) are quite model dependent .",
    "for instance , riess et al .",
    "@xcite obtain @xmath152 by using the ansatz @xmath153 , while the detailed analysis of the @xmath138cdm model performed by seljak et al .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath154 .",
    "in fig.[fig : decfig ] , we report the deceleration parameter for the best fit model parameters @xmath76 and three different baryon contents . for this particular model",
    ", @xmath155 takes positive values only in the redshift range @xmath156 so that the universe is accelerating also during the period when structure formation takes place in the concordance @xmath138cdm model .",
    "the situation is partially ameliorated considering models with larger values of @xmath82 since the redshift range over which @xmath155 is positive enlarges and shifts to higher @xmath71 .",
    "however , one should also take into account the effect of @xmath62 since this could significantly impact the behaviour of the deceleration parameter .",
    "as function of the redshift @xmath71 for the best fit model with @xmath157 and three different values of @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 ( short dashed ) , @xmath64 ( solid ) and @xmath65 ( long dashed ) .",
    "we set @xmath66 to convert from @xmath62 to @xmath67 . ]",
    "likely , the most worrisome feature of the van der waals quintessence scenario is the barotropic factor @xmath148 going to -1 in the past since this makes the van der waals fluid never behaving as standard cold dark matter which could suggest a completely unrealistic growth of perturbations in our scenario .",
    "however , such a conclusion is at least premature",
    ". let us consider the @xmath138cdm model that correctly describes the evolution of structures as we observe it .",
    "there are two fluids , standard cold dark matter with @xmath158 and the cosmological constant with @xmath159 , and during the structure formation epoch the cdm energy density dominates over that of the cosmological constant .",
    "actually , a very similar situation takes place in our model .",
    "indeed , we have checked that , in the redshift range where presumably structure formation takes place , the baryons energy density dominates over that of the van der waals fluid that , in this period , is very well approximated by a cosmological constant - like term for all values of the model parameters .",
    "therefore , in the far past our model is formally equivalent to the @xmath138cdm model with the baryons and the van der waals dark matter playing the roles of cdm and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "this nice result suggests that structure formation could evolve in a very similar way , but a detailed investigation is needed to draw a definitive answer .    as a first preliminary investigation",
    ", we may compute the positions of the first three peaks in the cmbr anisotropy spectrum using the procedure detailed in refs.@xcite . according to this prescription , in a flat universe made out of a matter term and a scalar field - like fluid ,",

    "note that the model predicted @xmath192 are affected by unknown errors due to both the approximated nature of the procedure adopted , one should compare the predicted values with what is obtained running a code that evaluates the full spectrum of perturbations .",
    "this test has been indeed performed with success only for scalar field dark energy with different choices of the self interaction potential .",
    "although it is likely that the method works with the same goodness also in our case given the similarity of our model with the cosmological constant in the prerecombination epoch , a detailed comparison is still needed . ] and to some subtleties we discuss later . to qualitatively take into account these systematics , we generously enlarge the error bars on the measured @xmath192 considering the @xmath187 ( @xmath186 ) confidence ranges for wmap ( boomerang ) observed quantities . considering the most stringent cut ( that on @xmath193 ) , fig.[fig : peaks ] shows that it is indeed possible to find out models that are in agreement with both the fit to the dimensionless coordinate distances and the position of the first three peaks .",
    "however , some caution is needed .",
    "the method adopted to compute @xmath192 implicitly assume that the standard theory of perturbation may be applied to the van der waals quintessence scenario we are discussing . in this case , the sound speed @xmath194 entering the growth of perturbations is usually defined as @xmath195 with @xmath196 the speed of light . using eqs.([eq : vdweq ] ) , we easily get :    @xmath197    that at @xmath43 reduces to :    @xmath198    having used eq.([eq : gammavsqz ] ) .",
    "this quantity is not well behaved since , for the model parameters in the range determined above , may become negative giving rise to a formally imaginary sound speed . moreover , during the evolution of the universe , @xmath199 can take negative values over a large redshift range . from this point of view",
    ", van der waals quintessence is similar to other unified dark energy models .",
    "in particular , sandvik et al .",
    "@xcite have considered the particular case of the generalized chaplygin gas and shown that it gives rise to oscillations or exponential blowup in the dark matter power spectrum inconsistent with observations .",
    "although only the generalized chaplygin gas has been investigated , they argue that similar problems also take place for every unified dark energy model because of these models having a negative @xmath199 .",
    "this could be an evidence against the van der waals scenario we are proposing .",
    "actually , things get different .",
    "first , one has to remind that @xmath200 is the _ adiabatic sound speed_. if the fluid fluctuations were adiabatic , then the pressure perturbation @xmath201 corresponding to a perturbation @xmath202 in the energy density should be @xcite :    @xmath203    so that if @xmath200 becomes negative or singular the perturbations go unstable .",
    "this is the case for our model , but this problem may be avoided by resorting to non adiabatic pressure perturbation . in this case , the relation between @xmath201 and @xmath202 is generalized as :    @xmath204    with @xmath205 the entropy contribution related to the anisotropic scalar stress @xmath206 . using the freedom in the choice of @xmath206 , it is then possible to define an effective sound speed that determines the scale under which the fluid energy is effectively smooth through the sound horizon .",
    "well above this scale , stress gradients are negligible and the standard theory of perturbations applies .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate how it is possible to implement such a mechanism for the van der waals quintessence and then study the problem of structure formation in this generalized scenario .",
    "we will address this topic in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the increasing bulk of astrophysical data accumulated in recent years has delineated a new standard cosmological paradigm . according to this picture ,",
    "the universe is spatially flat and driven by an unknown form of dark energy leading to an accelerated expansion .",
    "soon after the establishment of such a scenario , the hunt for candidates to the dark energy throne has started leading to the proposal of a plethora of mechanisms ranging from the old cosmological constant to various scalar field quintessence , to modification of friedmann equations ( motivated by extradimensions and braneworld theories ) and higher order geometrical terms in the gravity lagrangian @xcite . although being completely different in their dynamical properties and underlying physics , they all share the ability of well fitting the same set of data .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that the dark side of the universe is not only populated by dark energy , but also by dark matter whose nature is still far to be understood .",
    "it is thus tempting to ask whether these two ingredients are indeed different substances or two aspects of a single fluid whose properties are different from what we usually expect . to this regard",
    ", it makes sense wondering if the dust approximation used for matter is the right one to describe the equation of state of the dark matter . in a tentative to explain the observable quantities of our universe with the minimal number of ingredients , here we have investigated the possibility that dark matter and dark energy are actually a single fluid whose equation of state is that of a van der waals gas . in van der waals quintessence scenario , there is a single fluid whose equation of state comes directly from classical thermodynamics since the perfect gas approximation can not be used to describe phase transitions which occur during the evolution of the universe . although their contribution to the energy budget is nowaday subdominant , we also include baryons in the model since , because of the nonlinear character of the dynamical equations , they play an important role to determine how the main quantities evolve with the redshift .    any theory , as elegant and motivated it can be , is meaningless if it is unable to give a coherent description of the universe as it is observed .",
    "that is why we have tested van der waals quintessence against the dimensionless coordinate distance to sneia and radio galaxies .",
    "this allows to narrow the parameter space of the model considering the present day values of the deceleration parameter and of the ratio between the critical density of the universe and the van der waals critical density .",
    "we find :    @xmath207    with @xmath157 as best fit parameters .",
    "the constraints on @xmath82 are weak because of a serious degeneracy among the model parameters .",
    "indeed , different models of this class predicts values of @xmath102 which are in agreement with each other within the observational errors .",
    "however , lowering the uncertainties on @xmath102 in the redshift range @xmath133 or extending observations to higher redshifts ( up to @xmath208 ) will allow to break this degeneracy .",
    "both these possibilities are likely to become realistic in a near future thanks to the next - to - come satellite and ground based experiments .    motivated by this encouraging result ,",
    "we have compared the predicted age of the universe with that estimated from globular clusters in a model independent way .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that only a quite small region of the parameter space delimited by the above constraints is allowed by this test .",
    "moreover , @xmath136 turns out to be systematically high so that one could argue against the proposed model .",
    "actually , this conclusion is premature since our ignorance of the thermodynamical properties of the dark fluid makes it impossible to determine the redshift range over which eq.([eq : vdwour ] ) holds . indeed ,",
    "during the evolution of the universe , the dark fluid may undergo phase transitions thus changing its equation of state in a unpredictable way .",
    "since @xmath136 depends on the full evolutionary history of the universe , using eq.([eq : vdwour ] ) at all @xmath71 may induce a systematic error if the relation @xmath209 is altered .",
    "given these theoretical uncertainties , overemphasizing the result of the age test should be avoided .",
    "as a further test , we have also evaluated the position of the first three peaks of the cmbr anisotropy spectrum using the analytical approximation developed in refs.@xcite . comparing with the measured @xmath192 , we have individuated a region of the parameter space @xmath76 which is consistent with both the distance fit and the peaks position .",
    "although very encouraging , this result should be confirmed by evaluating the full spectrum and not the peaks position only . to this aim",
    ", one has to first investigate in more detail how perturbations grow in the van der waals quintessence scenario . because of the negative adiabatic sound speed , perturbations go unstable and one has to take into account also the role of anisotropic stresses and entropy production .",
    "we would like to conclude with a general comment .",
    "van der waals quintessence has turned out to be an interesting scenario for describing the late universe and seems able to solve the puzzle of dark energy without adding exotic fluids or arbitrary modifications of friedmann equations . on the other hand ,",
    "classical thermodynamics tells us that the van der waals equation of state is only an approximated description of a realistic fluid . in our opinion , before invoking the help of _ new physics _ , it is worth wondering whether _ classical physics _ could still suggest the way to shed light on the dark side of the universe .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank our friend monica capone for the fruitful discussions on this topic and ester piedipalumbo and crescenzo tortora for help with the position of the peaks .",
    "we are also grateful to an unknown referee for his stimulating report .",
