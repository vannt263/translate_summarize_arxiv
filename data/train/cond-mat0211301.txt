    "electrical conductivity due to variable - range hopping ( vrh ) in doped crystalline and amorphous semiconductors has been a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies for more than three decades @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the vrh conductivity is described by stretched exponents @xmath7 and depending on the value of @xmath8 can be attributed to one of the two major regimes such as the mott ( @xmath9 ) and the shklovskii - efros ( @xmath10 ) regimes @xcite .",
    "several observations of giant and colossal negative vrh _ magnetoresistance _ in systems with strong spin disorder such as dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "it seems rather natural to attribute vrh magnetoresistance to spin polarons that are believed to be a major cause of negative magnetoresistance in dms @xcite .",
    "however , a theory of vrh magnetoresistance has never been addressed in the literature , partially , because of the belief that spin - polaron hopping may lead only to a simple activation dependence of the conductivity which mimics nearest - neighbor hopping @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that in the systems with significant disorder of the magnetic energies spin - polaron hopping is described by a stretched exponent similar to that of the mott behavior .",
    "the study of electrical conductivity in solids , which is controlled by polaron hopping , has centered so far on materials where the polaronic part of the activation energy is fixed @xcite . indeed , the lowering of the free energy of the system due to atomic spin alignment @xcite ( or lattice polarization @xcite ) in the vicinity of the trapped carrier , the so called polaron shift , and its associated hopping barrier are generally determined by the spatial extent of the localized states between which the hopping occurs .",
    "this is usually true no matter how strong the coupling between a localized carrier and magnons ( or phonons ) and how many of them are emitted or absorbed during the hopping event @xcite .",
    "( sometimes , non - linear polaron effects may lead to an additional self - localization of the bound state resulting in the actual collapse of its wave function @xcite .",
    "these situations are out of the scope of the present paper for they would hardly be favorable for the hopping process . )",
    "that is why in standard lightly doped semiconductors the polaron hopping barrier can be considered fixed @xcite .",
    "( this is also correct in heavily doped and compensated nonmagnetic semiconductors , where at low temperatures conductivity is controlled by electron hopping between aggregations of impurities of a fixed size close to the screening length @xcite . ) in all these cases , the bound polaron spectrum has a hard gap resulting in a predominantly activation temperature dependence of conductivity even in the variable - range hopping ( vrh ) regime @xcite .",
    "recent technological developments in producing novel dilute magnetic semiconductors , especially @xmath11 , and magnetic nanostructures , such as @xmath12 made it possible to observe electrical conductivity due to hopping via magnetic impurities @xcite and nano - islands @xcite thus revealing a rich interplay of magnetic and electrical transport properties .",
    "for instance , @xmath13 atoms play a dual role as acceptor sites and magnetic ions in @xmath14 resulting in the very unusual magnetic properties of this material @xcite .",
    "giant negative magnetoresistance has been observed @xcite below the metal - insulator transition point of @xmath11 , which clearly displays the vrh behavior with no sign of the hard magneto - polaron gap .",
    "the absence of this gap in the electrical conduction experiments can be understood by taking into account local fluctuations of the bound polaron shifts .",
    "these , in turn , may be related to the distribution of exchange couplings between @xmath13 ions and holes as was suggested in ref",
    "in addition , it is quite possible that the fluctuations of the local spin polaron shifts are not correlated with those of the  bare  electron energies . in",
    "heavily doped and compensated samples @xcite of @xmath11 , the former can be determined by the total number of magnetic impurities in the localization volume while the latter may depend on the electrically active ones . for @xmath15 nanoislands embedded in @xmath14 matrix @xcite , the distribution of polaron shifts follows the distribution of the islands volumes .",
    "meanwhile , the  bare  electron spectrum of the islands is apparently determined by the distribution of the islands sizes and shapes .",
    "we will show that fluctuations of the local ( lattice and spin ) polaron shifts in certain circumstances may wash out the hard polaron gap , leading to a substantial modification of the standard mott law for the electrical conductivity @xcite even in the absence of coulomb correlation effects .",
    "bound spin ( magnetic ) polarons , in contrast to their lattice counterparts , possess polaron shifts that , as well as their distribution , can be tuned by applied magnetic field thus resulting in giant or even colossal magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "externally controlled switching off and on of the magneto - polaron effect also allows one to better identify the hopping mechanism in magnetic materials .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to develop a consistent theoretical approach to the description of variable - range hopping of polarons in materials where disorder gives rise not only to the electron - energy distribution but , also , to the distribution of local polaron shifts .",
    "this approach is based on percolation theory and monte carlo simulations . in section [ qual ]",
    ", we will present simple qualitative arguments concerning the main results of the present paper .",
    "a rigorous theoretical derivation of these results is given in section [ resistivity ] .",
    "section [ montecarlo ] deals with the monte carlo simulations of the polaron hopping problem aimed at finding the universal constants and functions that appear in the applications of the percolation theory .",
    "effects of the low boundary in the distribution function of the polaron barriers will be considered in section [ lowtemp ] . in section [ gmr ]",
    "we briefly discuss giant negative magnetoresistance in magnetic semiconductors and nanostructures , a phenomenon that in some materials can be controlled by variable - range variable barrier hopping of the spin polarons .",
    "we will start from a qualitative description of the low - temperature electrical resistivity in a system where localized states have electronic energies randomly distributed in the vicinity of the fermi energy @xmath16 .",
    "the derivation of the original mott s law is based on the assumption that the density of states in such a system near @xmath16 is constant @xcite .",
    "in addition to this assumption , we will suppose that the states in questions possess randomly distributed polaron barriers as well .",
    "our goal is to find out how this factor would modify the standard mott s law for dc hopping conductivity .    in the original mott s derivation",
    ", it is assumed that at a given temperature @xmath1 most of the hopping events involve random sites with one - electron energies belonging to a strip of width @xmath17 around the fermi level . in our case",
    ", we have to account for an additional random distribution of the polaron barriers .",
    "thus we generalize the mott conjecture and introduce a hyperstrip of width @xmath17 and height @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is a scatter of the polaron barriers .",
    "the probabilty of a typical hopping event for two sites belonging to this hyperstrip reads : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the localization radius of the electron wave function , @xmath1 is measured in the energy units , and @xmath21 is the average distance between the sites of the hyperstrip : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the concentration of the sites in the hyperstrip , @xmath242 or 3 is the spatial dimension of the system and @xmath25 is a joint density of ( polaronic ) states ( dos ) , such that @xmath26 is a probability , per unit volume , to find a site with @xmath27 in the interval @xmath28 and @xmath18 in the interval @xmath29 .",
    "( as in the original mott s derivation @xcite , we assume that @xmath25 is constant .",
    "however , this is not true if the coulomb correlations are taken into account @xcite . )    after substituting ( [ distance ] ) in ( [ w_ij ] ) , it is easy to find that the probability ( [ w_ij ] ) as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath18 will reach its sharp maximum at @xmath30 the hopping conductivity , @xmath31 , is proportional to @xmath32 . therefore , substituting the optimal values ( [ opt ] ) and ( [ distance ] ) in ( [ w_ij ] ) yields the following expression for the hopping resistivity :    @xmath33 ,   \\label{rho_opt}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath34    and @xmath35 is a numerical factor of the order of unity . expression ( [ rho_opt ] ) constitutes the main result of the present paper .",
    "( in the next section , we will obtain this result by means of a more rigorous percolation theory approach .",
    "also , by using the monte carlo simulation described in section 4 we will be able to find the numerical factor @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ t_tilda_d ] ) . )",
    "it can be seen that , in accordance with the above derived formula , in the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) case the well known mott s exponent 1/4 ( 1/3 ) ( see @xcite ) should be substituted with a somewhat larger exponent of 2/5 ( 1/2 ) .    as the temperature goes up both the width and the height , ( [ opt ] ) , of the optimal hyperstrip increase while the optimal hopping distance ( [ distance ] ) decreases .",
    "it means that with increasing temperature the polaron chooses to jump over increasingly smaller distances at the cost of overcoming the increasingly higher and higher polaron ( and electron energy ) barriers .",
    "that is why we call this regime a variable - range , variable - barrier hopping ( vrvbh ) . in this regime , in contrast to the nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) of polarons , both the lattice @xcite or the magnetic ones @xcite , the polaron hard gap is washed out by the fluctuations of the polaron shifts ( barriers ) .",

    "the electron , @xmath49 , and the combined , @xmath25 , dos can not anymore be treated as constant in the vicinity of the fermi level due to the appearance of the soft coulomb gap in the electron spectrum @xcite .",
    "the latter is related to the long - range coulomb correlation effects in the spatial distribution of electrons above and holes below the fermi energy .",
    "the maximal width of this gap can be estimated as @xcite    @xmath50 ^{1/(d-1)}\\simeq \\left [ \\left ( e^{2}/\\kappa a\\right ) ^{d}/t_{m}^{(d)}\\right ] ^{1/(d-1 ) } ,   \\label{coulomb_gap}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the dielectric constant of the material and @xmath52 is the electron charge .",
    "this gap will modify the vrvbh law ( [ rho_opt ] ) at low temperatures when its width exceeds the width ( [ opt ] ) of the optimal strip : @xmath53 , i.e. when @xmath54 with    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is given by expression ( [ t_tilda_d ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the temperature interval ( @xmath57 ) , where the vrvbh regime ( [ rho_opt ] ) exists , may be sufficiently large if the polaronic effect is strong enough .",
    "based on the evaluations of @xmath25 , presented in section 6 , it is possible to show that the required condition @xmath58 is equivalent to @xmath59 .",

    "however , is possible to show ( see appendix ) that if @xmath63 tunneling transition is governed either by strong multiphonon coupling ( for the lattice sp ) or by thermodynamic fluctuations of the local magnetization ( for the bmp ) , when @xmath64 the hopping rate    @xmath65 ,   \\label{gamma}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the spatial - decay length of the localized wave function into the semiconductor matrix , @xmath66 is an equilibrium energy of the @xmath67-th site with the localized carrier ; @xmath68 is the `` bare '' electron energy of the carrier - free state and @xmath69 is the bound polaron shift .",
