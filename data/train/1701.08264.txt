    "a topological phase of matter with a symmetry @xmath0 is an equivalence class of gapped quantum lattice systems with a symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "one can study either ground states or hamiltonians . for classification purposes , it is the same@xcite . in terms of ground states ,",
    "the equivalence relations are of two kinds : tensoring with a product state , eg .",
    "the ground state of a trivial paramagnet ( this adds new degrees of freedom ) , and local unitary transformations of the ground state commuting with @xmath0 .",
    "topological phases of matter can be `` stacked together '' , by taking tensor product of hilbert spaces , hamiltonians , and ground states , and taking the @xmath0 symmetry of the stack to be the diagonal one .",
    "this operation makes the set of topological phases with a symmetry @xmath0 into a commutative unital semigroup , a set with an associative and commutative binary operation and a neutral element , but not necessarily with an inverse for every element .",
    "a short - range - entangled ( sre ) topological phase with symmetry @xmath0 is a topological phase with symmetry @xmath0 which has an inverse .",
    "sre topological phases in @xmath1 spatial dimensions with symmetry @xmath0 form an abelian group .",
    "sre topological phases are interesting in part because they are more manageable than general topological phases but still retain many interesting topological properties .",
    "fermionic sre topological phases ( fsre phases ) are particularly rich .",
    "free fsre phases , ie .",
    "equivalence classes of quadratic hamiltonians of hopping fermions , have been classified in all spatial dimensions @xcite . in the interacting case",
    ", there is a fairly complete picture of fsre phases in dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite ( the abelian group structure on the set of 1d fsres was recently studied in @xcite ) .",
    "gu and wen also constructed a large class of fsre phases in all dimensions using the `` supercohomology '' approach @xcite .",
    "but it is clear by now that this construction does not produce all possible fsre phases .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that fsre phases can be classified using spin - cobordism of the classifying space of @xmath0 .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a recent mathematical result that relates ( spin ) cobordisms with unitary invertible ( spin ) tqft @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that the relation between tqfts and topological phases of matter is not well understood .",
    "in particular , given a spin - cobordism class it is not clear in general how to construct a lattice fermionic system which belongs to the corresponding fsre phase .",
    "neither is it clear which physical properties distinguish systems corresponding to different cobordism classes .    in dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "these problems have been solved , at least in the case when @xmath0 acts unitarily .",
    "for example , 1d fsre phases are classified by a triple @xcite : @xmath4 to each such triple one can assign a concrete integrable lattice hamiltonian as well as a spin - cobordism class of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of each member of the triple is understood ( they describe properties of the edge modes of the system ) .",
    "similar results for 2d fsre systems have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to extend some of these results to dimension @xmath6 .",
    "our approach is based on the idea of bosonization / fermionization .",
    "it is a well - known result that every lattice fermionic system in one spatial dimension corresponds to a lattice bosonic system with a global @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "this is usually explained using the jordan - wigner transformation . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that one can obtain fermionic systems in @xmath1 spatial dimensions starting from bosonic systems with a global @xmath8-form @xmath7 symmetry generated by a fermionic quasiparticle .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath7 symmetry must have a particular t hooft anomaly which is trivialized when the spin structure is introduced .",
    "the fermionic system can be recovered by gauging the @xmath7 symmetry , i.e. by coupling the bosonic system to a dynamical @xmath1-form gauge field valued in @xmath7 as well as a simple fermionic system . in 1d and 2d",
    "every fsre phase arises in this way from a suitable bosonic system , and it is natural to conjecture that this is also true in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , we will argue that in 3d a new phenomenon occurs which makes the bosonization approach a bit more involved .",
    "namely , the fermion parity operator @xmath9 can get contributions from both particle and string states , and the string contribution can not be written in a local way .",
    "microscopically , these strings carry a 1d fsre phase ( the kitaev chain @xcite ) , which may have a fermionic ground state depending on how it is embedded into space .",
    "we call these objects kitaev strings . from the mathematical viewpoint",
    ", this means that the bosonic shadow has both 2-form and 1-form global @xmath7 symmetries , with a nontrivial `` interaction '' between them , and both need to be gauged in order to get an fsre phases .",
    "we propose a generalization of the gu - wen supercohomology which accounts for this new phenomenon .",
    "we also write down a concrete 3d lattice bosonic model which , when coupled to a background @xmath0 gauge field , gives the bosonic shadow of a general 3d fsre phase .",
    "this theory is interesting in its own right as a very simple non - abelian 3 + 1d topological order , analogous to the ising anyons in 2 + 1d .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3 we recall topological bosonization in one and two spatial dimensions and how it is used to classify fsre phases .",
    "we also interpret the classification in terms of properties of domain walls and their junctions in a broken symmetry phase . in section 4",
    "we describe our proposal for 3d bosonization and propose a classification of 3d fsre phases . in section 5",
    "we write down a 3d bosonic model which can serve as a bosonic shadow for 3d fsre phases . in section 6",
    "we briefly discuss a new class of 3d phases which seem to be neither bosonic nor fermionic , although they contain `` fermionic strings '' . in section 7",
    "we summarize our results and discuss possible higher - dimensional generalizations",
    ".    we will be interested in models where the fermion number is conserved modulo @xmath3 .",
    "accordingly , the eigenvalues of the fermion number operator @xmath10 are defined only as elements of @xmath11 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the fermion parity operator @xmath9 are @xmath12 .",
    "we will freely use simplicial cochains and operations on them , including steenrod squares .",
    "some properties of steenrod squares and stiefel - whitney classes are recalled in appendix [ steenrodreview ] .",

    "it is well - known that 1d fermionic systems can be mapped to bosonic systems with @xmath7 symmetry by means of the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite .",
    "this tranformation is not an equivalence , as it does not preserve certain physical properties .",
    "for example , it maps the majorana chain @xcite ( a discretization of the massive majorana fermion ) to the quantum ising chain . depending on the values of the parameters ,",
    "the latter model can have a doubly - degenerate ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state of the majorana chain is always unique .",
    "it is best to think about the jw transformation as  gauging the fermion parity \" .",
    "this becomes more obvious when one considers the bosonization transformation on a circle@xcite .",
    "while the massive fermion on a circle requires a spin structure , the corresponding bosonic system does not . on the other hand , since it has a @xmath7 symmetry , it can be coupled to a @xmath7 gauge field . to obtain the bosonic hilbert space from the fermionic hilbert space",
    "one has to  sum over spin structures \" .",
    "conversely , the fermionic hilbert space can be obtained from the bosonic one by `` summing over @xmath7 gauge fields . ''",
    "the scare quotes indicate that certain topological terms are important in these sums .",
    "one can describe the connection between bosonic and fermionic hilbert spaces on a circle in complete generality .",
    "the bosonic hilbert space has a @xmath7-untwisted sector and a @xmath7-twisted sector , which we denote @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "each of these can be further decomposed into eigenspaces of the @xmath7 global symmetry : @xmath15 on the other hand , the fermionic hilbert space has an ns sector and a r sector , which we denote @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and each of them decomposes into eigenspaces of the fermion parity @xmath18 : @xmath19 these decompositions are related as follows : @xmath20 in particular , the @xmath21 component of the total fermionic hilbert space , @xmath22 , is the untwisted sector of the bosonic theory @xmath23 , while the @xmath24 component @xmath25 , is the twisted sector of the bosonic theory @xmath26 .",
    "these relations can be interpreted as follows : to get the fermionic hilbert space from the bosonic one , one gauges the @xmath7 symmetry and identifies the holonomy of the @xmath7 gauge field @xmath27 as the fermion parity @xmath18 . for each value of @xmath28",
    ", one needs to project to a particular value of the @xmath7-charge to select either the ns or r sector states : more precisely , if we label the spin structures by @xmath29 so that @xmath30 corresponds to the ns sector and @xmath31 corresponds to the r sector , then the generator of @xmath7 acts in the sector with the holonomy @xmath27 with the weight @xmath32 . note that the weight is a ( exp-)linear function both of the spin structure and the @xmath7 gauge field on a circle .    as an example , consider the majorana chain @xcite and the quantum ising chain .",
    "the quantum ising chain has a gapped phase with an unbroken @xmath7 ( paramagnet ) and a gapped phase with a spontaneously broken @xmath7 ( ferromagnet ) .",
    "consider the limit of an infinite energy gap .",
    "then in the unbroken phase the system has a unique ground state both for the trivial and the nontrivial @xmath7 gauge field .",
    "on the other hand , in the broken phase , the system has two ground states with a trivial @xmath7 gauge field ( a @xmath33-even one and a @xmath7-odd one ) , and no ground states when the @xmath7 gauge field is turned on because in the limit of infinite energy gap the energy of the domain wall between the two vacua is infinite .",
    "the majorana chain also has two phases , depending on the sign of the parameter which corresponds to the fermion mass in the continuum limit . for both signs of the mass",
    ", there is a unique ground state for either choice of the spin structure on a circle .",
    "the difference is that for a positive mass the ramond - sector ground state has @xmath21 , while for a negative mass it has @xmath24 .",
    "the ground state in the ns sector has @xmath21 in both cases .",
    "the jw transformation maps the positive - mass majorana chain to the ising chain with a spontaneously broken @xmath7 , while the negative - mass majorana chain is mapped to the ising chain with an unbroken @xmath7 .",
    "note that the majorana chain ( for either sign of the mass ) is an fsre , but the quantum ising chain in a phase with a spontaneously broken @xmath7 is not a bosonic sre phase .",
    "thus bosonization and fermionization do not map sre phases to sre phases .",
    "this also applies in higher dimensions , as we will see .    when considering 1d systems on a circle , it is easy to mistake a spin structure for a @xmath7 gauge field .",
    "the distinction between them becomes clearer when we consider systems on a curved space - time with a nontrivial topology .",
    "it will be useful to write down a relation between the partition functions of the fermionic theory and its bosonic `` shadow '' on a general riemann surface @xmath34 .",
    "the fermionic partition function depends on a spin structure on @xmath34 , while the bosonic partition function depends on a @xmath7 gauge field @xmath35",
    "( i.e. an element of @xmath36 ) .",
    "a nice way to think about a spin structure on @xmath34 is as follows @xcite : every spin structure @xmath37 gives rise to a quadratic function @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 conversely , every such quadratic function corresponds to a spin structure on @xmath34 .",
    "one says that @xmath40 is a quadratic refinement of the bilinear form @xmath41 .",
    "note that the set of spin structures is not an abelian group ( there is no natural way to define a group operation on the set of quadratic refinements of a fixed bilinear form ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the set of equivalence classes of @xmath7 gauge fields is an abelian group .",
    "we note for future use that the latter group naturally acts on the set of spin structures : for all @xmath42 we let @xmath43    given this relation between spin structures and quadratic refinements , the relation between the partition functions can be written as a nonlinear discrete fourier transform : @xmath44    in our example of the ising / majorana correspondence , @xmath45 is a delta function @xmath46 setting @xmath47 in the ferromagnetic phase ( because of the infinite energy of the domain wall ) and the constant 1 in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "so the former coincides with the constant fermionic partition function while the latter coincides with the arf invariant , which is the partition function of the kitaev chain @xcite , agreeing with what we expect from the microscopic jw transformation .",
    "fsres in 1d ( with arbitrary interactions ) have been classified in @xcite using bosonization and matrix product states .",
    "see also @xcite , where the same results were obtained using fermionic mps .",
    "the result is that the set of fsre phases with a unitary symmetry @xmath0 is classified times fermion parity , rather than an extension of @xmath0 by fermion parity .",
    "the generalization to nontrivial extensions is straightforward .",
    "] by triples @xmath48 of group cohomology classes ( [ onedfsre ] ) .",
    "all of these parameters can be be interpreted in terms of properties of the edge zero modes .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is the number modulo two of majorana zero modes at each edge of the system .",
    "for example , the negative - mass majorana chain @xcite has @xmath50 and a single majorana zero mode at every edge .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 tells us whether a particular element @xmath52 commutes ( @xmath53 ) or anti - commutes ( @xmath54 ) with the fermion parity @xmath9 when acting on the edge zero modes .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 controls the projective nature of the action of @xmath0 on the edge zero modes .",
    "if any one of these parameters is non - vanishing , the system must have nontrivial edge zero modes , and therefore the ground state on an interval is degenerate in the large - volume limit .",
    "it is instructive , although somewhat nontrivial , to interpret these parameters without appealing to the edge zero modes @xcite .",
    "it is helpful to introduce a nontrivial spacetime geometry and a fixed background @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "let us imagine that the ir limit of the system is described by a unitary continuum 2d quantum field theory , then we can wick - rotate it and place it on an arbitrary riemann surface @xmath56 , perhaps with a nonempty boundary @xmath57 .",
    "for a fermionic system , this requires choosing a spin structure on @xmath56 , which also induces a spin structure on each boundary circle in @xmath57 .",
    "there are two spin structures on a circle : periodic ( ramond ) and anti - periodic ( neveu - schwarz ) .",
    "they are also known as non - bounding and bounding spin structures , respectively , since the ns spin structure on a circle can be obtained by restricting the unique spin structure on a disk , while the ramond spin structure can not be so obtained .",
    "since we are dealing with an fsre phase , the ground state on a circle is non - degenerate for either choice of the spin structure , and one can show that in the ns sector it is always parity - even @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 tells us whether the ground state in the ramond sector is bosonic ( @xmath59 ) or fermionic ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "one can also couple the system to a flat @xmath0 gauge field and consider the ground states on a circle with a holonomy @xmath52 ( and an arbitrary spin structure ) . for any @xmath52",
    "there is a unique ground state ( again by the sre assumption ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 tells us whether it is bosonic a fermionic for the ns spin structure ( for the ramond spin structure , the fermion parity of the ground state is shifted by @xmath58 ) . when the symmetry @xmath0 is broken , turning on a holonomy @xmath61 around the circle leads to a particle - like domain wall ; the paremeter @xmath60 tells us whether it is bosonic or fermionic .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath62 describes the `` s - matrix '' of the domain walls obtained when the symmetry @xmath0 is spontaneously broken . to be more precise ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath63 .",
    "then all domain walls are bosonic , and since the theory is trivial away from the domain walls , one should be able to compute the partition function by summing over possible domain - wall worldlines .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is a phase attached to a junction of domain walls labeled by @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "together , these parameters define a 2-dimensional spin cobordism class of @xmath5 via the atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a 2 + 1d lattice fermionic system can be obtained from a 2 + 1d bosonic system ( its bosonic `` shadow '' ) with an anomalous @xmath7 1-form symmetry .",
    "let us remind what this means @xcite .",
    "a parameter of a global 1-form @xmath7 symmetry is a @xmath7 gauge field , i.e. a 1-cocycle ( cech or simplicial ) with values in @xmath7 , defined up to a @xmath7 gauge transformation ( i.e. up to adding an exact 1-cocycle ) .",
    "this symmetry is assumed to preserve the action , but can not be gauged .",
    "that is , one can not promote the parameter @xmath67 to a general @xmath7-valued 1-cochain even at the expense of introducing a 2-form gauge field @xmath68 ( i.e. a 2-cocycle with values in @xmath7 which transforms as @xmath69 ) while maintaining gauge invariance .",
    "the anomaly of a bosonic shadow has a very specific form : the partition function @xmath70 on a closed oriented 3-manifold @xmath71 transforms under @xmath69 by a factor @xmath72 it was shown in @xcite that one can obtain the fermionic partition function by performing a nonlinear discrete fourier transform : @xmath73\\in h^2(y,{{\\mathbb z}}_2 ) } z_b(b ) ( -1)^{q_{\\zeta}(b)}\\ ] ] here we use an observation @xcite that to every spin structure @xmath74 on a triangulated closed oriented 3-manifold @xmath71 one can associate a quadratic function @xmath75 which under @xmath69 transforms as @xmath76 the construction and properties of the function @xmath77 are discussed in appendix [ qeta ] . thanks to ( [ quadratictransf3d ] ) , the summand in ( [ fourier3d ] ) is a well - defined function on @xmath78 .    unlike in 2d",
    ", the definition of the quadratic function @xmath77 depends on additional choices : a branching structure on the triangulation .",
    "the bilinear form on @xmath79 corresponding to the quadratic function @xmath77 is independent of @xmath74 but depends on these extra choices : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a certain bilinear operation @xmath82 introduced by steenrod @xcite ( see appendix [ steenrodreview ] ) .",
    "one can show that spin structures on @xmath71 are in one - to - one correspondence with quadratic refinements of this bilinear form which transform according to ( [ quadratictransf3d ] ) , see appendix [ qeta ] and@xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ fourier3d ] ) says that the fermionic theory is obtained from the bosonic one by gauging the @xmath7 1-form symmetry .",
    "the factor @xmath83 is needed to cancel the gauge anomaly .",
    "it is instructive to see how the gauging works on the hamiltonian level .",
    "consider a space - time of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath34 is a closed riemann surface .",
    "there are two sectors in the gauged bosonic theory distinguished by the flux of the 2-form gauge field @xmath68 through @xmath34 .",
    "the untwisted sector @xmath85 is identified with the @xmath21 sector of the fermionic hilbert space , while the twisted sector @xmath86 is identified with the @xmath24 sector of the fermionic hilbert space .",
    "the gauge 1-form @xmath7 symmetry acts in each sector by unitary operators @xmath87 , @xmath88 . by fixing a gauge",
    ", we can assume that @xmath67 is closed , so that each sector is acted upon by @xmath89 .",
    "this action is projective because of the t hooft anomaly .",
    "the corresponding 2-cocycle is computed following a standard procedure , see appendix [ descent ] and @xcite .",
    "we get @xmath90 in particular @xmath91 . as in the 1d case ,",
    "the sector corresponding to a particular spin structure @xmath37 on @xmath34 is obtained by decomposing the hilbert space into eigenspaces of @xmath87 , namely @xmath92 this is consistent with ( [ projcocycle3d ] ) thanks to ( [ quadratic2d ] ) . )",
    "can be trivialized by defining @xmath93 and requiring physical states to be invariant under @xmath94 for all @xmath95 . ]",
    "let us now recall the classification of 2d fsre phases proposed in @xcite .",
    "they are labeled by triples @xmath96 which satisfy the equations @xmath97 the first two of these are the gu - wen equations which describe supercohomology phases .",
    "the bosonic shadow of all these fsre phases can be taken to be the toric code equivariantized with respect to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the homomorphism @xmath98 tells us which elements of @xmath0 exchange the @xmath99 and @xmath100 excitations of the toric code .",
    "the toric code has an action @xmath101 and a global 1-form @xmath7 symmetry which acts by @xmath102 @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "one can check that this 1-form symmetry has the right t hooft anomaly .",
    "one can interpret the data @xmath105 in physical terms .",
    "as stated above , a nonzero @xmath106 means that the element @xmath61 acts as particle - vortex symmetry of the toric code .",
    "this implies that an insertion of a flux @xmath61 of the background gauge field carries a majorana zero mode ( or more precisely , an odd number of majorana zero modes ) . in the symmetry - broken phase ,",
    "this insertion becomes an endpoint of a domain wall , and thus the corresponding domain wall carries a negative - mass majorana chain . in what follows we will call a 1d defect with this property a kitaev string . let us denote by @xmath107 the domain wall corresponding to the group element @xmath61 .",
    "note that since fusing @xmath107 and @xmath108 produces @xmath109 , and the number of majorana zero modes must be preserved modulo @xmath3 , we must have @xmath110 i.e. @xmath58 is a homomorphism .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 is most easily interpreted if @xmath59 .",
    "then the endpoint of each domain wall carries no fermionic zero modes , and one might as well assume that the endpoint has fermion parity zero .",
    "but when considering networks of domain walls , we might need to assign fermion parity @xmath112 to each triple junction , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 meet .",
    "requiring that the fermion number of the network does not change under pachner moves , one gets a constraint saying that @xmath115 is a 2-cocycle ( with values in @xmath7 ) .",
    "equivalently , one may consider the surface of a tetrahedron , and regard each edge as a domain wall . since this network can be consistently continued into the interior of the tetrahedron ,",
    "the fermion parity of the network must vanish .",
    "this again gives the condition @xmath116 .",
    "note also that since every domain wall has two ends , we can shift the fermion parity of the endpoint of @xmath107 by @xmath117 without changing the net fermion parity of the network .",
    "this shifts @xmath115 by a coboundary : @xmath118 thus only the cohomology class of @xmath119 has a physical meaning .",
    "when @xmath106 is non - vanishing , the situation is not very different .",
    "the key point is that at the junction of three domain walls we have an even number of majorana zero modes , thanks to the condition ( [ sigmaishomomorphism ] ) .",
    "they act irreducibly on a fermionic fock space , and one can imagine turning on a local interaction at the junction that lifts the degeneracy and makes one of these states the ground state .",
    "the fermion parity of this ground state is @xmath115 .",
    "the same arguments as above show that @xmath115 is a 2-cocycle defined up to a coboundary .",
    "the parameter @xmath120 has the same meaning as in the bosonic case , i.e. it describes the amplitude assigned to a point - like junction of four domain wall worldsheets in space - time . to derive a constraint on it",
    ", one needs to consider a 3-sphere triangulated into a union of four tetrahedra , pass to the dual cell complex and insert a domain wall along every 2-face of this cell complex . on the one hand ,",
    "the amplitude muct be trivial , because such a configuration of domain walls can be created out of a trivial one .",
    "on the other hand , one can evaluate it taking into account the fermionic statistics of the triple domain wall junctions @xcite .",
    "the resulting constraint is the gu - wen equation @xmath121    when the parameter @xmath58 is nontrivial , some domain walls are kitaev strings and consequently carry fermion number when wrapping cycles with ramond spin structure .",
    "note that a homologically trivial kitaev string automatically carries zero fermion number , because the spin structure induced on it by the spin structure in the ambient space is of the ns type .",
    "therefore the contribution of the kitaev strings to the fermion number is nonlocal and depends on the homology class of the string network . to determine its form , note first that the homology class of the kitaev strings is the poicare - dual of @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the @xmath0 gauge field on @xmath34 . assuming that the fermion number depends only on the homology class of the string",
    ", we may assume that the kitaev string wraps a closed curve @xmath124 on @xmath34 whose homology class is dual to @xmath125 .",
    "then the spin structure induced on @xmath124 is ramond precisely if @xmath126 .",
    "therefore we can identify @xmath127 with the contribution of kitaev strings to the fermion number @xmath10 .",
    "note that it is nonlocal , as expected , and conserved .",
    "this explains why we could ignore it when identifying the fermion number with a local expresson @xmath128 : in 2d fsre phases , the particle and strings contrubutions to the fermion number are separately conserved .    as in the 1 + 1d case ,",
    "these triples define spin cobordism classes of @xmath5 via the atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence .      in this section",
    "we discuss ground states of a simple lattice model which is a bosonic shadow of the trivial 2d fsre phase following @xcite .",
    "this is a warm - up for a similar discussion of 3d fsre phases in later sections .",
    "we need a bosonic tqft which has a 1-form @xmath7 symmetry with the correct anomaly .",
    "a bosonic tqft can be constructed from a spherical fusion category @xmath129 .",
    "its objects can be thought of as boundary line defects for a particular boundary condition .",
    "bulk line defects are described by objects in a modular tensor category @xmath130 , the drinfeld center of @xmath129 .",
    "a generator of a 1-form @xmath7 symmetry is a bulk line defect and thus corresponds to an object @xmath131 with a fusion rule @xmath132 .",
    "such an object has topological spin @xmath133 which satisfies @xmath134 .",
    "it measures the anomaly of the 1-form @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "since we want the anomaly to be of order @xmath3 , the topological spin must be @xmath135 , i.e. @xmath136 must be a fermion .",

    "there is an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath233 .",
    "the zipper is a place where three domain walls meet .",
    "we can attach to the boundary of the domain wall @xmath107 a closed kitaev string ; this does not affect any observables , like degeneracies and fermion parities ( because the boundary of every domain wall is closed and can be contracted to a point ) , but it shifts the 2-cocycle @xmath233 by a coboundary .",
    "which is easily seen to be a homomorphism from @xmath0 to @xmath33 . since we assumed that @xmath0 is finite , this parameter vanishes .",

    "specifically , since the general 3d fsre phases are supposed to contain both a condensate of fermionic particles and a condensate of kitaev strings , we are led to consider bosonic shadows with both a 2-form @xmath7 symmetry and a 1-form @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "particles will be associated with generators of the 2-form symmetry , while strings will be associated with generators of the 1-form symmetry .    in general , when a field theory has 0-form , 1-form and 2-form symmetries , the whole symmetry structure is described by a 3-group .",
    "a general 3-group is quite a complicated object , but it simplifies when we ignore 0-form symmetries . in that case , the 3-group is characterized by its 1-form symmetry group @xmath267 , its 2-form symmetry group @xmath268 , and a postnikov class taking values in @xmath269 . in the present case @xmath270 , and @xmath271 , so there is only one nontrivial possibility for the postnikov class .",

    "first , although not every closed oriented 4-manifold is spin ( a counter - example being @xmath403 ) , every closed oriented 4-manifold admits a @xmath390 structure .",

    "second , gauging a 1-form @xmath7-symmetry means proliferating strings .",
    "their worldsheets are poincar - dual to @xmath221 .",
    "the anomalous nature of the 1-form symmetry means that these strings need a @xmath390-structure for their definition .",
    "such strings were discussed recently in a somewhat different context by one of us @xcite and were dubbed fermionic strings . their normal bundle is framed , and the wavefunction is multiplied by @xmath135 when the framing is twisted by one unit . thus phases requiring @xmath390 structure may be called fermionic string phases .    a simple way to construct a fermionic string phase is to start with a bosonic model with a 2-form @xmath7 symmetry and anomaly ( [ guwenanomaly ] ) and set @xmath405 .",
    "this means that we are embedding the 1-form @xmath7 symmetry into the 2-form @xmath7 symmetry group and then gauge the 1-form symmetry .",
    "the resulting theory clearly has no @xmath7-grading on its hilbert space , because @xmath406 vanishes for any oriented 3-manifold @xmath71 .",
    "this means that in general fermionic string phases do not have a conserved @xmath7-valued charge analogous to @xmath9 .",
    "it also illustrates that ordinary fermionic phases do not really come in two types corresponding to the @xmath407 in @xmath259 because we can flip the sign by a redefinition of the symmetry operators corresponding to the shift @xmath408 .",
    "a further insight is obtained by noticing that while the homology 2-cycle dual to @xmath68 represents the string worldsheet @xmath56 , the homology 1-cycle dual to @xmath409 can be thought of as the 1-cycle on @xmath56 which is dual ( in the 2d sense ) to the 1st stiefel - whitney class of the normal bundle of @xmath56 . note that while the 4-manifold @xmath164 is assumed to be oriented , @xmath56 need not be orientable . since we may think of @xmath272 as @xmath409",
    ", we conclude that fermionic string phases have fermion worldlines confined to fermionic string worldsheets .",
    "finally , let us give a couple of examples of bosonic shadows of fermionic string phases .",
    "first , as remarked above we can take a shadow of any standard fermionic phase ( with a 2-form @xmath7 symmetry only ) and embed the 1-form @xmath7 symmetry into the 2-form @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "for example , we can take the model ( [ ww ] ) and consider a global 1-form @xmath7 symmetry which acts as follows : @xmath410 it is easy to see that the action is invariant for any closed oriented @xmath164 and any @xmath67 .",
    "another way to obtain a shadow of a fermionic string phase is to start with a model with both a 1-form and a 2-form @xmath7 symmetries and a mixed anomaly @xmath411 and then set @xmath412 .",
    "that is , we embed the 1-form @xmath7 symmetry into a product of 1-form and 2-form @xmath7 symmetries in a nonstandard way . as a simple example , consider the @xmath7 gauge theory in 3 + 1d with an action @xmath413 one can get the desired anomaly ( [ bsqbanomaly ] ) by considering the following action of a global 1-form @xmath7 symmetry : @xmath414 gauging this symmetry means proliferating the strings and the particles of the @xmath7 gauge theory , but with particles confined to the string worldsheets in a particular way .",
    "since the particles are not local with respect to the strings , one is forced to choose a @xmath390-structure on @xmath164 to make the result well - defined .",
    "we have argued that every 3d fermionic model has a bosonic shadow which has a certain 3-group symmetry @xmath285 with an anomaly .",
    "further , we argued that 3d fsres with a finite unitary symmetry @xmath0 are classified by triples @xmath105 satisfying certain rather complicated equations generalizing the gu - wen supercohomology .",
    "we proposed that bosonic shadows of all such models are @xmath0-equivariant versions of a certain 4d tqft which we called the 2-ising model .",
    "if @xmath415 vanishes , we can replace this 4d tqft with the simplest crane - yetter - walker - wang model and recover the supercohomology phases .    gauging the anomalous 3-group symmetry @xmath285",
    "is achieved by proliferating fermionic particles and kitaev strings .",
    "it would be interesting to construct explicitly the resulting lattice model .",
    "our proposed classification of 3d fsre phases can be made concrete once we pick a particular symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "let us give a few examples .",
    "if @xmath416 with @xmath392 odd , both @xmath119 and @xmath58 vanish , and 3d fsre phases are classified by the same data as bosonic fsre phases . if @xmath416 with @xmath392 even , we only get gu - wen supercohomology phases , because the parameter @xmath58 vanishes . indeed ,",
    "while @xmath417 if @xmath392 is even , the generator of this @xmath7 does not square to zero ( in fact , it generates a polyominal ring inside @xmath418 @xcite ) .",
    "hence the equation @xmath419 has solutions only if @xmath420=0 $ ] . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath0 is a product of several copies of @xmath7 , we only get supercohomology phases , since the cohomology ring of @xmath0 with @xmath7 coefficients is a polynomial ring @xcite , and any element of @xmath421 which squares to zero must be trivial .",
    "the simplest example where there are phases which are not supercohomology phases is @xmath422 .",
    "@xmath423 is generated by two elements @xmath424 of degree @xmath2 and an element @xmath425 of degree @xmath3 .",
    "the only relation is @xmath426 .",
    "thus @xmath421 has a unique nontrivial nilpotent element @xmath427 .",
    "if we set @xmath428 , we get 3d fsre phases where the zipper @xmath429 , where @xmath430 and @xmath66 is a kitaev string , while all other zippers are `` trivial '' .",
    "overall , for @xmath422 we get four supercohomology phases ( including the trivial phase ) , and four non - supercohomology phases .",
    "we also found a new class of phases which are neither bosonic , nor fermionic , in that they have `` fermionic strings '' but no fermionic particles .",
    "their partition function depends on a @xmath390-structure on the 4-manifold .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore the physics of these new phases .",
    "our discussion was not as systematic as that of @xcite because we lack an algebraic description of completely general unitary 4d tqft .",
    "in particular , while we outlined the structure of various monoidal 2-categories relevant to us , we did not describe all the data which enter into a definition of these objects .",
    "we hope to return to this issue in the future .",
    "our results suggest that bosonization in higher dimensions will get progressively more complicated as the dimension increases .",
    "this complexity reflects the topological complexity of the spin - bordism spectrum .",
    "for example , in four spatial dimensions presumably one would have to deal with a symmetry 4-group which involves 3-form , 2-form and 1-form symmetries .",
    "bosonic shadows of gu - wen supercohomology phases would be quite special since they only possess 3-form symmetries .",
    "we review here some definitions and results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we mostly work with simplicial cochains of a triangulated manifold @xmath164 with values in @xmath7 .",
    "we assume a local order on vertices of the triangulation .",
    "there is a coboundary operation @xmath431 satisfying @xmath432 . as usual , a cochain annihilated by @xmath433",

    "the @xmath81 product is not commutative either , rather one has @xmath442 where yet another product @xmath443 appears , etc .",

    "we have stiefel - whitney classes @xmath451 , @xmath452 .",
    "the class @xmath453 is an obstruction to orientability .",
    "if @xmath453 vanishes , then the class @xmath391 is an obstruction to having a spin structure .",
    "these classes satisfy a number of relations . in particular , @xmath397 for all @xmath392 .",
    "there also relations which depend on @xmath392 .",
    "for example , for @xmath454 we have @xmath455 , so any orientable 2-manifold admits a spin structure .    on a closed @xmath392-manifold @xmath164 we also have the wu formula : @xmath456=v_{n - p}\\cup [ a],\\quad [ a]\\in h^p(x,{{\\mathbb z}}_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath457 is a certain polynomial in stiefel - whitney classes independent of @xmath164 .",
    "it is known as the wu class .",
    "the lowest wu classes are @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 .",
    "the wu formula has many useful consequences .",

    "another consequence is that on a spin 4-manifold @xmath164 the square of every element in @xmath464 vanishes .",
    "the t hooft anomalies reveal themselves in how the symmetry algebra is realized projectively by unitary operators on the hilbert space . for an anomaly @xmath465 coming from group cohomology",

    ", we discuss the descent procedure for anomalies of 1-form and 2-form @xmath7 symmetries relevant for fermionization .",
    "unfortunately the calculation of descendants of the @xmath285 symmetry anomaly is beyond the scope of this paper .      as a warm - up",
    ", we consider the 1-form @xmath7 symmetry in 2 + 1d with the anomaly @xmath467 this cohomology class also defines an effective action for a bosonic spt in 3 + 1d protected by the 1-form @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "we can use it to compute the spt ground state on a closed oriented 3-manifold @xmath164 .",
    "we consider the path integral on the cone with base @xmath164 , denoted @xmath468 .",
    "@xmath468 can be made from the cylinder @xmath469 $ ] by collapsing @xmath470 to a point . from this description",
    "one sees that a 2-form gauge field on the cone @xmath471 is the same thing as a homotopy from the trivial gauge field on @xmath472 to some other gauge field on @xmath473 .",
    "this is of course the same thing as a gauge transformation on @xmath164 and is parametrized by a @xmath7 1-cochain @xmath474 .",
    "computing the sum over all these @xmath67 where we remember the ( ungauged ) boundary condition on @xmath164 we obtain the state @xmath475 we can rewrite this state as @xmath476 this expression makes it clear that @xmath477 is short - range entangled , since it is produced from a product state @xmath478 by time @xmath479 evolution of a hamiltonian defined by @xmath480 this function is called the first descendant of @xmath481 .",
    "it also determines the variation of the partition function of the 2 + 1d theory under the 1-form gauge symmetry transformation .",

    "we find a variation in the exponent @xmath484 which defines the second descendant @xmath485 this means that for closed @xmath164 the spt ground state is invariant under global 1-form symmetry , but when @xmath486 is nonempty , it is invariant only up to a boundary term : @xmath487 it also tells us whether the global 1-form symmetry acts projectively on the hilbert space of the 2 + 1d theory .",
    "that is , whether transforming by @xmath488 is any different than transforming by @xmath489 followed by @xmath490 .",
    "this is measured by @xmath491 so indeed we do have a projective symmetry action measured by a bilinear form on the symmetry 2-group @xmath492 .",
    "as we have seen above , such cocycles are trivialized by quadratic refinements of the form , which in this dimension we may obtain from a spin structure .",

    "we find @xmath503 this variation involves the boundary variation we expected from the previous calculation but also a new ingredient : a prefactor @xmath504 this factor is not a boundary term for a general @xmath164 and @xmath181 . for example , when @xmath505 and @xmath181 represents the unique nonzero degree-2 class , this prefactor is @xmath135 .",
    "such a symmetry transformation multiplies the ground state by @xmath135 .",

    "indeed , it has a variation @xmath508 which looks like it could be exact but unfortunately is not .",
    "this means that the symmetry action on the boundary is only defined for cocycles @xmath509 and not cohomology classes .",
    "likewise , the bilinear form @xmath510 is only well - defined on @xmath511 .",

    "now we want to consider what happens with the map @xmath628 . for this",
    "we can use naturality of the atiyah - hirzebruch - serre spectral sequence .",
    "we know that our nonzero classes in @xmath602 come from @xmath629 and @xmath630 . because the first is proportional to @xmath391 and the second to @xmath390 , these map to zero on closed spin 5-manifolds , which all have @xmath587 and @xmath631 .",
    "this implies that the map @xmath628 sends all the gauge anomalies to zero ( and @xmath623 too , for that matter ) .",
