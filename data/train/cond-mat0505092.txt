    "the insensitivity of the metallic conventional superconductors to nonmagnetic impurity doping is well known and was be explained in terms of abrikosov and gorkov ( ag ) theory @xcite and anderson s theorem ( at)@xcite . according to this theorem the superconductor critical temperature , @xmath1 , and the superconductor density of states",
    "are not affected by the nonmagnetic impurity scattering .",
    "in contrast to this behavior in conventional metallic superconductors , in the high temperature superconductors ( htc ) doping of a small amount of nonmagnetic impurities like @xmath3 destroys superconductivity , as reported for @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5@xcite , @xmath6@xcite , @xmath7@xcite . physical evidence such as @xmath8 dependence of penetration depth in disordered htc @xcite and stm measurements on single",
    "@xmath3 doped on @xmath9@xcite , shows that non - magnetic impurities behave as strong scattering centers .",
    "while this can be understood as a consequence of d - wave pairing in htc , this kind of strong - scattering impurity role has raises the question for strong scattering effects in s - wave superconductors ?",
    "in particular , do the order parameter , density of states and especially @xmath1 change with impurity doping . in other words , is the anderson theorem valid ?",
    "ghosal et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the local order parameter and the density of states of a disordered s - wave superconductor with a uniform impurity distribution , @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "they found that in the strong scattering limit , @xmath11 , for some regions of space the local order parameters are zero while in some others they are finite .",
    "a binary alloy s - wave superconductor has been investigated by one of us@xcite , and it has been found that in the strong scattering limit the average order parameter goes to zero and a superconductor to insulator phase transition is take place , so the at is violated in this case .",
    "also the existence of an impurity bound state in a disordered s - wave superconductor energy gap is discussed by balatsky et al.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the validity of at for s - wave superconductors in detail , by calculating @xmath1 as a function of impurity concentration and electron band filling .",
    "this is in contrast to previous work challenging at in s - wave superconductors@xcite which were calculations of the order parameter and density of states , not directly of @xmath1 .",
    "we found that at low impurity concentrations and in the weak scattering ( @xmath12 ) regime , the deviation of @xmath1 with respect to the clean system critical temperature @xmath13 is negligible , and hence at is satisfied .",
    "but in low impurity concentrations at the strong scattering limit , although superconductivity is preserved , the @xmath1 is much less than @xmath13 , so the at is not obeyed . by increasing @xmath2 in the strong scattering limit",
    "@xmath1 is completely suppressed hence a superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition take placed@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also calculated @xmath1 at a fixed averaged band filling for different impurity on - site energies and impurity concentration .",
    "our results show that @xmath1 is decreased by increasing impurity concentration and eventually goes to zero in the strong scattering regime .",
    "we start our investigations with the following attractive hubbard model on a two dimensional square lattice@xcite ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 are the hopping integrals , @xmath16 is the local attractive interaction between electrons of opposite spin , and @xmath17 is the chemical potential . finally , @xmath0 is the random on - site energy which takes values of @xmath18 with probability @xmath2 for impurity sites and @xmath19 with probability @xmath20 for the host sites .    in the mean field approximation , for any given configuration of impurity sites the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] is given by the bogoliubov de gennes equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the on - site renormalized chemical potential due to the usual hartree decoupling .",
    "the local order parameter @xmath24 , assumed to be real , is defined by , @xmath25 and the local band filling @xmath26 is , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fermi function .",
    "eq.[eq : bogoliobovdegenneequation ] can be written as , @xmath29 where the random potential matrix @xmath30 is @xmath31 and the clean normal system green function @xmath32 is given by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bulk band structure . in our numerical calculations hopping to the first and second nearest neighbors is considered and we neglected other hopping terms , so @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction potential is chosen to be @xmath36 .",
    "the dyson equation for the average green function , @xmath37 , corresponding to eq.[eq : expanding interms of random onsite potential ] is , @xmath38 where the self energy , @xmath39 , is defined by , @xmath40 the fourier transformation of eq.[eq : dyson equation ] leads to the following relation for the average green function @xmath37 , @xmath41 eq.[eq : local order parameter]-[eq : avegrage green function ] should be solved to determine the averaged green function , @xmath37 . in general",
    "there is no analytical solution for such systems , so it should be solved approximately .",
    "many approximations such as self - consistent born approximation or abrikosov - gorkov theory where is valid for weak scattering ( @xmath42 ) and all impurity concentrations@xcite , self - consistent t - matrix approximation where is limited to the case of low impurity concentrations@xcite and the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) where is valid for all impurity concentrations and impurity strengths@xcite , @xmath19 , and also recover both self - consistent boron approximation ( scba ) and self - consistent t - matrix approximation ( sctma ) @xcite , have been applied . to compare abrikosov - gorkov theory ( weak scattering limit ) and strong scattering case ( @xmath43 ) we use cpa where in the weak impurity strengths ( @xmath42 )",
    "is equal to the self - consistent boron approximation of abrikosov - gorkov theory .",
    "in the cpa formalism inter - site correlations are neglected and each lattice site is replaced with a site of an effective medium except one which is called the _ impurity site _ and is denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "so the self energy is local and takes the same value for all sites , @xmath45 , hence eqs.[eq : self energy definition ] and [ eq : avegrage green function ] are reduce to@xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , where the _ impurity _ green function , @xmath48 , is related to the averaged green function @xmath49 as@xcite , @xmath50 the new average green function @xmath51 is given by taking an average over all possible impurity configurations , @xmath52 eqs.[eq : cpa self energy definition]- [ eq : avimpurity green function ] should be solved self consistently to provide @xmath51 .",
    "we continue our discussions by derivation of a set of equations to obtain the critical temperature in the cpa formalism .    at @xmath1",
    "both the local and average order parameter @xmath24 and @xmath53 go to zero , and the spatial deviation of the local order parameter , @xmath54 , with respect to the averaged order parameter , @xmath53 , is negligible , so @xmath55 by inserting eq.[eq : cpa equality of order parameters ] in eq.[eq : cpa self energy definition ] we found that , @xmath56 since at @xmath1 the system is normal , the first terms in the left hand side and right hand side of eq.[eq : tc cpa ] are equal and cancel each other . therefore we find , @xmath57 by inserting eq.[eq : cpa self energy and order parameter ] into the gap equation , eq.[eq : local order parameter ] , for the average order parameter,@xmath58 , at @xmath1 we obtain , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the clean system density of states defined by , @xmath61 eqs.[eq : cpa equality of order parameters ] and [ eq : cpa self energy and order parameter ] , eqs.[eq : cpa self energy definition]-[eq : avimpurity green function ] should be solved self consistently to calculate @xmath62 and @xmath63 . then these self energies should be inserted in to eq.[eq : tc equation ] to obtain the critical temperature , @xmath1 .",
    "we considered several cases , first in the weak scattering regime , @xmath64 where cpa is equal to scba ( abrikosov - gorkov theory ) , @xmath1 is calculated in terms of average band filling , @xmath65 , for different impurity concentrations .",
    "fig.[figure : tc - delta - c0.05 ] shows @xmath1 in terms of @xmath65 at a fixed impurity strength , @xmath66 , for different impurity concentrations .",
    "as one can see , @xmath1 is changed only very little with respect to the clean system , and hence anderson s theorem is satisfied in weak scattering , as expected .",
    "second , @xmath1 was calculated in terms of @xmath65 at fixed impurity concentrations , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for different value of @xmath19 varying from weak ( scba or abrikosov - gorkov theory ) to strong scattering .",
    "fig.[figure : tc - delta - c0.1-c.15-c.2 ] illustrates our result in this case .",
    "for all these impurity concentrations in the strong scattering regime @xmath1 decreased with respect to the clean system significantly and for some band fillings there is no superconductivity .",
    "also we found that for high impurity concentrations , @xmath68 and @xmath69 a superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition is take placed as previously predicted by us@xcite    thirdly , @xmath1 was calculated for fixed values of the scattering strengths , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and different values of impurity concentration .",
    "we found by increasing impurity concentration @xmath1 is reduced and at a critical impurity concentration superconductivity completely disappears .",
    "fig.[figure : tc - avfill - delta2t - delta20t - cpa ] shows the results in this case .",
    "finally , at a fixed band filling , @xmath72 , the critical temperature @xmath1 is plotted as a function of impurity concentration for different value of @xmath19 .",
    "fig.[figure : tc - c - nav0.9-cpa ] shows that for weak scattering @xmath42 ( scba or abrikosov - gorkov theory ) , the critical temperature @xmath1 is not much influenced by increasing impurity concentration while in the strong scattering regime @xmath1 is decreases linearly with impurity concentration and superconductivity is completely destroyed .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have investigated response of the critical temperature @xmath73 of an s - wave superconductor to non - magnetic impurity doping .",
    "three cases are considered .",
    "first , in the weak scattering regime @xmath42 ( scba or abrikosov - gorkov theory regime ) , @xmath1 is calculated for different impurity concentrations .",
    "here we found that the @xmath1 is not affected by impurity doping so the anderson theorem is satisfied in the case of low impurity concentrations and weak scattering .",
    "second , at fixed impurity concentrations @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath1 is calculated in terms of band filling for different value of @xmath19 .",
    "we found that by increasing @xmath19 the critical temperature decreased and at a critical @xmath19 a superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition takes place .",
    "third , at fixed @xmath70 and @xmath71 the critical temperature is calculated in terms of band filling .",
    "our results in this case show that by increasing impurity concentration @xmath1 is again reduced , and at a critical concentration a superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition again takes place . finally at a fixed band filling @xmath72 ,",
    "@xmath1 is plotted in terms of impurity concentration . in this case we found in the weak scattering regime ( scba or abrikosov - gorkov theory regime )",
    "@xmath1 is not much influenced by increasing impurity concentration but at strong scattering regime @xmath1 is linearly decreased by increasing impurity concentration .",
    "therefore , we conclude that anderson s theorem@xcite only holds in the weak scattering ( born approximation ) regime , originally considered by abrikosov and gorkov@xcite . in stronger scattering even non - magnetic impurities can suppress s - wave superconductivity and lead to greatly reduced @xmath73 or even a transition to a non - superconducting insulator state .",
