    "relatively high - snr fringes on space baselines can be only seen between halca and the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope , and the phased vla which has the equivalent sensitivity of a single 115-m antenna .",
    "the longest baseline measures 524 m@xmath18 corresponding to a resolution of 0.3 mas ( uniform weighting ) and was achieved between the vlba antenna located at saint croix in the virgin islands and halca .",
    "from fig . [ fig1 ] we see that 2021 + 614 has a simple symmetric structure at 5 and 15  ghz , dominated by two bright components .",

    "the weight is the reciprocal amplitude variance for the visibility measurement and is obtained from the internal scatter of the data within the averaging interval .",
    "the averaging time is limited by the coherence time , which for earth - based vlbi observations at 5 and 15 ghz is well above the 2-min averaging time adopted .",
    "in addition , to avoid complicated models with numerous components for the 5 ghz vsop observation , the highest spatial frequencies were excluded .",

    "this program fits the fourier - transformed image - plane model to the real and imaginary parts of the complex visibilities ( in contrast to other programs which fit the visibility amplitudes and closure phases ) and tacitly assumes that the visibility phases are well calibrated .",

    "parameters of all components were allowed to vary during the process .",
    "this procedure was repeated until the reduced @xmath34 did not decrease any further . in order to keep the number of parameters needed to fit the brightness distribution as small as possible we used elliptical gaussian components as well as components represented by delta functions .",
    "+ for a model that is a good approximation to the data , the expected value of reduced @xmath34 should be about 1 . the reduced @xmath34 characterizing our best fitting models ( e.g. for the 5 ghz observation ) was never less than 2.7 .",
    "this indicates that the fit is poor .",
    "the reason for this is most likely that our simple models of a small number of components do not reproduce the extended , low surface brightness emission .",

    "nearby local minima occur when the intensity or shape of one of the components degenerates .",
    "the associated source models can be rejected on the basis of their containing negative or unnaturally elongated components .",
    "the minima found for all uv data sets could be identified as being global .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( middle and lower panel ) that a change in relative intensity of the two brightest components has occurred . in conway s model for the 1982.9 observation",

    "however , in the clean - component image from the 1997.8 data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left ) there is faint extended structure seen at the position corresponding to component g.      it is of interest to check whether the ongoing source evolution  detected as an increase in component separation  follows the self - similar evolution model , which has been proposed for young radio sources , such as gps and css sources ( snellen et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; snellen & schilizzi @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ self - similar evolution of a simple two - component compact symmetric source requires a proportional increase of the component sizes as the source components separate from each other .",
    "an increase in the size of the components in the image plane must be accompanied in the uv - plane by a proportional decrease of the fwhm of the upper envelope of the amplitudes which convolves the amplitude variation due to the beating of the two components .",
    "these decaying fringes can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the upper envelope for the 1997.8 data is traced as a dotted line .",

    "instead , we observe a decrease of the component size as the source expands , contrary to that expected in the self - similar growth model .",
    "this can be seen from fig [ fig4 ] ( bottom ) where the gaussian - like upper envelope from the 1997.8 fringes lies above the 1982.9 epoch maxima , indicating that source components have shrunk in size .",
    "the observed shrinkage of 20% is not due to high spatial frequency information from self - calibrating the complete 5-ghz vsop uv data set before modelfitting . for the purpose of detecting changes in source structure",
    "we flagged the halca baselines before performing self - calibration .",
    "compact radio sources can roughly be classified into two morphological groups whose different appearances are believed to arise from orientation effects . for sources showing _ symmetric double _ structure , the radio axis ,",
    "along which the individual components are aligned , lies near the plane of sky , whereas in sources with _ core - jet _ morphology the radio axis is pointing more towards the observer . in the latter case the observed structure is highly affected by projection and relativistic effects . in which category does 2021 + 614 belong ? + the high resolution vsop image ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left ) reveals many details not seen in earlier observations .",
    "it shows that at the higher resolution provided by the space baselines , a compact component is visible between component b and d at the end of a low brightness jet in the direction of component d. its central position relative to the two most prominent components , b ( ne hotspot / lobe ) and d ( sw hotspot ) and the low surface - brightness linear feature ( jet ) connecting it with component c ( sw lobe ) suggest its identification as the central engine of activity  the core .",
    "+ the presence of component a and the extended emission seen at 5  ghz south - east of the central component are possibly not consistent with a classification as a cso .",
    "while component a could be outward moving plasma emitted from the core at an earlier epoch than component b and d , it could be argued that d is the core component , since it is the most compact component and has the most inverted spectrum between 5 and 15 ghz and thus the highest turnover frequency .",
    "in addition component d is situated at the end of a linear arrangement of source components c , e , b and a which could be interpreted as regions of high emissivity ( knots ) along the path of an outward flowing jet .",
    "we note that conway et al .",
    "( @xcite ) give component g ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right ) and the extended emission detected east of component d as a possible counterjet identification .",
    "they argue that the misalignment could be explained by projection effects . on the 5 ghz vsop map ,",
    "however , this component is resolved out , which is not consistent with identifying it as a compact counterjet / hotspot . + our rate of separation of components b and d of @xmath35 @xmath36as / yr obtained from a linear regression fit , corresponds to an apparent speed of separation of @xmath51 in the source reference frame .",
    "this means that the two components were ejected @xmath52 yr ago assuming constant velocity .",
    "with respect to the weak central component at the nucleus the speed of separation is @xmath53 .",
    "+ the `` interference pattern method '' of parametrizing the structural change in the source ( see appendix a ) shows that the percentage increase in the separation along the position angle defined by the u and v stretching factors @xmath54 is 3.0% .",
    "this increase over a timerange @xmath55 of 14.9 years between epoch 1982.9 and 1997.8 implies that components b and d were ejected @xmath56 yr ago , assuming constant velocity . the apparent inconsistency between this value and the @xmath57 yr source age deduced above",
    "is caused by underestimation of the uncertainty by the linear regression fit process .",
    "a conservative estimate for the source age and its error given by the average of the two age values , is @xmath3 yr .",

    "+ however , based on the assumption that a linear relation fits the separation measurements well and errors for individual data points are equal , a linear regression fit can provide error estimates for the separation measurement . adopting this procedure",
    "we obtain an uncertainty of 2.1 @xmath36as for separation measurements and 0.2 @xmath36as / yr for the separation rate at 5 ghz .",
    "this method , however , excludes the possibility of an independent estimate for the goodness - of - fit .",
    "+ statistically correct treatments , such as elliptical gaussian fits in the image plane ( e.g. aips task ` jmfit ` ) yield very small positional uncertainties for high dynamic range images ( fomalont @xcite ) .",
    "the image in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( middle ) allows the separation between component b and d to be determined with an accuracy an order of magnitude better as compared to the linear regression fit .",
    "+ in order to circumvent this inconsistency between error estimations for the separation measurements and to obtain a second , independent source age estimate we developed a new method which we present below .      our goal is to determine changes in source structure occured between 1982.9 and 1997.8 directly in the uv plane , using the amplitude interference patterns .",
    "these changes are parametrized by a two - dimensional stretching factor whose components along the u and v - axis are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and by an amplitude correction factor @xmath72 .",
    "our method provides estimates for these quantities and for their uncertainties . in this way , interpreting the observed shift in the position of the visibilty amplitude minima between the two epochs ",
    "best seen in fig .",

    "+      conway s 1982.9 data set was obtained during a 9 hour global vlbi observing run using 4 antennas in the usa and the 100-m dish in effelsberg .",
    "consequently , compared to our 1997.8 data set the uv coverage is sampled more sparsely and the two observations measure different spatial frequencies .",
    "+ in order to obtain two data sets suitable for detecting an increase in separation between the two most prominent components we prepared the two uv data sets as follows : _ 1982.9 _  a simple two - component model , comprising components b and d from conway s six - component model for the 1982.9 observations , was fourier - transformed back into the uv - plane .",
    "the model visibility amplitudes were calculated on a @xmath73 pixel grid with mesh size of 0.5 m@xmath18 ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 m@xmath18 in both the u and v - dimension .",
    "this grid spacing was fine enough to detect a decrease in the position of the first minimum of a few percent ; _ 1997.8 _  all the model components except b and d were uv - subtracted from the 1997.8 observations . in order to take account of the flux density variability of the components , the relative intensities of b and d were adjusted to match conway et al s values .",
    "then , the visibility amplitudes for the 1997.8 data , sampled along the uv - tracks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left ) , were gridded onto the @xmath73 pixel mesh .",
    "+ the gridding of the visibility data was done by assigning the visibility value to the nearest grid point .",
    "multiple assignments near the uv - plane centre were averaged together , but no special weighting was applied to those data points .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows a grey - scale plot of visibilty amplitudes measured during the 1997.8 observation , prepared as explained above and gridded onto the @xmath73 pixel mesh .",
    "+ after having prepared the data sets we assumed that all remaining differences between 1997.8 `` data '' and 1987.9 `` model '' are either due to real expansion or a residual multiplicative amplitude correction factor , @xmath76 .",
    "the parametrization of the change in separation was done by applying multiplicative factors , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , to the sampled uv - points and associating the amplitude value of the original point with the new coordinates .",
    "such an evolution model is , strictly speaking correct , only for unresolved source components which separate from or contract towards each other .",
    "for a pair of resolved components , modelled by elliptical gaussians , the resulting fringe pattern is convolved with an elliptical gaussian whose major and minor axis fwhm are inversely proportional to the corresponding parameters in the image plane .",
    "we investigated the impact of this simplification on the fitting process and concluded that it is minor and therefore negligible at the levels of accuracy involved .",

    "this fit is too poor to use the @xmath84-contour projections onto the parameter axes to determine the 1-@xmath85 uncertainties for @xmath86 , @xmath77 and @xmath79 . nevertheless , the procedure outlined above provided us the best - fit values for the overall amplitude correction factor , @xmath87 and for the scale factors in u and v - direction , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "the relatively high residual correction of 0.88 needed for the amplitude parameter , and the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath79 , are due to different component sizes at the two epochs .",

    "+ for the 1997.8 observation we generated one hundred uv - data samples each containing a different 50% of the original data .",
    "the visibility measurements in each sample were selected randomly .",
    "we fitted the one hundred data sets to conway s model visibilites as outlined in the previous section for the whole data set , but this time fitting only the two scale factors @xmath77 and @xmath79 , and setting @xmath76 to its best - fit value of 0.88 .",
    "the standard deviations of the best - fit parameters provide the errors associated with these quantities .",
    "we found @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this means that using 50% of the available data we are able to determine a 4% decrease in separation of the minima along the u - axis and a 2% decrease along the v - axis at an accuracy level of 5% and 10% , respectively  _ clear evidence for real motion_. the difference in accuracy is due to the higher percentage increase along the u - axis .",
    "the values found agree with the scale factors determined using all the data , reported at the end of the previous section .",
    "the errors improve by a factor of @xmath93 if twice as many amplitude measurements are used .",
    "+ in order to check the results we obtained for the scale - factor errors @xmath77 and @xmath79 we can carry out a simple calculation .",
    "3% is the minimum change in scale factor which moves the uv - points by at least one pixel for uv - loci with @xmath94 m@xmath18 . with about 5200 uv - points obeying this constraint , and taking into account that",
    "each measured and gridded point contributes significantly to the shift determination , the accuracy of the shift determination is improved by a factor of @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 , which in first approximation agrees with the errors reported above .",
