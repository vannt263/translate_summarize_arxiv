    "bipolar molecular outflows were discovered @xcite to be associated with the vicinity of l988e , as well as the vicinity of l988a and l988f , and there is also high velocity co emission ( blue - shifted lobe only ) to the west of l988c .",

    "[ scuba13co_fig ] ) coincides with the peak intensity of @xmath1co emission , although a ne extension of the submillimeter emission does not have a parallel in the low spatial resolution molecular map : since the intensity of the emission varies on scales larger than the map size (  @xmath41 ) outside the peak , there is no information on the larger scale dust emission due to the iterative way the map is built , assuming that the edges chop into zero emission .",
    "thus the scuba - measured emission is not ideal for illustrating the extent of the molecular cloud . despite adequately mapping the extent of the cloud , available low spatial resolution ( @xmath108 beam size ) co emission line maps @xcite are also not ideal for comparing the dust distribution with the yso distribution .",
    "in addition to inadequate spatial resolution , there are issues associated with low signal to noise in diffuse regions ( c@xmath7o ) , and optical depth issues leading to saturation in dense cores ( @xmath1co ) , as well as co depletion due to chemistry and/or freeze - out in dense cores , and/or varying excitation temperature .",
    "although we could in principle utilize the iras 100 @xmath8 m hires map of the dust emission , it is more useful to use the higher spatial resolution @xmath68-derived extinction maps described in @xmath912 to compare the extended dust distribution with the yso distribution .",
    "note that the map of a@xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ ak13co_fig_ha ] ) , at the same spatial resolution as the scuba map , shows the ne extension from the core indicating higher dust density , as seen by scuba .",
    "in addition , there are many small regions of enhanced extinction , and the extent of the molecular cloud defined by the a@xmath67 map exceeds that suggested by the co maps .",
    "all cloud tracers show an abrupt eastern edge to the cloud , which bifurcates the central cluster into the relatively high surface density population embedded within the cloud core , and the somewhat lower surface density population outside the cloud .",
    "this edge was likely produced by the two haebe stars : as stated by @xcite , lkh@xmath0 324 and 324se ` have excavated a cavity on that edge and cleared out the area to the east , thereby exposing a small cluster of h@xmath0 emission - line stars . '",
