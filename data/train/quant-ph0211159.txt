    "these effects may have important consequences for quantum communication , especially when the communicating parties are in relative movement .    in this paper",
    ", we show that for a pair of spin-1/2 massive particles , if the momenta are appropriately entangled , the entanglement between the spins can remain the same as in the rest frame when viewed from any lorentz - transformed frame .",
    "we also find a set of states , of which the marginal entropy , entanglement and measurement results of the spins are independent of the frames from which they are observed .",
    "further , we suggest a relativistic - invariant representation of the quantum bit ( qubit ) , and suggest a relativistic - invariant protocol for quantum communication , with which the non - relativistic quantum information theory could be invariantly applied to relativistic situations .",
    "though , in this paper , we restrict ourselves to spin-1/2 cases , the generalization to larger spins could be done analogously .",
    "particularly , the generalization to spin-1 massless particles , such as photons @xcite , may be of special interests since current experiments for quantum communications are mostly based on photons .",

    "[ t ]    fig1.eps    one possible explanation for that the concurrence decreases less with the presence of momentum entanglement is as follows . boosting the state",

    "the transfer of momentum entanglement to spins hence compensates the decrease of spin entanglement , and the lorentz - transformed concurrence decreases less .",
    "when the momenta of the two particles are perfectly correlated , even though may be not maximally entangled , the transfer of entanglement from momenta to spins happens to fully compensate the decrease of spin entanglement , so the entanglement of the reduced spin state remains maximal when viewed by any lorentz - boosted observer .",

    "( [ eq 1 ] ) with momentum distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq 11 ] ) , the reduced density matrix remains the same as in the rest frame when viewed by any lorentz - boosted observer .",
    "thus the entanglement between the spins remains maximal if viewed from any lorentz - transformed frame .",
    "indeed , the following four bell  states all have invariant reduced density matrices for spins viewed from any frame lorentz boosted along the @xmath23-axis .    [",

    "further , the states in eqs .",
    "( [ eq 21 ] ) , together with those differing by only rotations , constitute a set of states of which the entanglement between the spins remains maximal when viewed from any lorentz - transformed frame .",

    "the only restriction on @xmath62 is that the states in eqs .",
    "( [ eq 21 ] ) could be normalized .",
    "an application of possible interests of the above results is to suggest a relativistic - invariant protocol for quantum communication .",
    "conventionally using the spin of a single spin-1/2 particle to represent a qubit may not be appropriate in relativity theory , because the reduced density matrix for its spin is generally not covariant under lorentz transformations @xcite . if and only if for momentum eigenstates ( plane waves ) , the reduced density matrix for the spin of a single particle could be covariant under lorentz transformations , but momentum eigenstates are not localized and difficult for feasible applications . however , two spin-1/2 particles that are appropriately entangled , such as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq 21 ] ) without being momentum eigenstates , could indeed have reduced density matrix for spins to be invariant under lorentz transformation .",
    "such invariance provides us the possibility to feasibly represent a single qubit using two appropriately entangled spin-1/2 particles , in a lorentz - invariant manner . taking into account that in many practical situations of communication , one may need to maintain the particles along desired directions , here we focus on the idea case where the momenta of the pair of particles have deterministic directions , and assume that the two particles are moving along the same deterministic direction .",
