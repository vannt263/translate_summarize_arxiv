    "the research on stellar oscillations within the framework of gr goes back to the early studies of chandrasekhar from almost half a century ago @xcite .",
    "the field continues to attract great interest , because the investigation of stellar oscillations can reveal the inner structure of dense stars and shed light on the equation of state of superdense matter . in this paper",
    "we focus exclusively on radial oscillations , for which the assumption of spherical symmetry holds . while radial oscillations are not detectable by gravitational waves due to the vanishing quadrupole moment of a radially moving sphere , they are in principle observable by emission of electromagnetic radiation , whenever there is a charge separation at the surface of the star .",
    "first calculations for radial modes with a sample of different eos were performed in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a large survey of radial oscillations for several zero - temperature equations of state was done in @xcite .",
    "the radial modes of strange stars were studied in @xcite@xcite and references therein . in @xcite",
    "the effect of color - flavor locking in the quark phase of strange stars on the radial modes was investigated .",
    "they found , that the oscillation periods for high mass strange stars are shifted to higher values , as the gap parameter is increased .",
    "nonlinear effects in radial oscillations were discussed in @xcite , where it was found that they may stabilize stars beyond the `` maximum mass limit '' , due to nonlinear coupling of modes .",
    "this paper complements the existing studies on radial modes in several respects .",
    "first , we consider stellar models which give maximum masses close to the present observational limit of @xmath0 @xcite@xcite .",
    "second , we calculate the radial modes for stars with a gibbs construction and consider realistic equations of state for the quark and hadronic phases @xcite@xcite",
    ". some of the previous studies on radial modes for hybrid stars @xcite used the maxwell construction , where there is a discontinuity in the baryon density .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite the models with maxwell construction lead to higher maximum masses then their gibbs counterparts . generally , we find a reduction in the frequencies associated with the deconfinement phase transition .    in our analysis",
    "we also consider compact stars with net electric charge .",
    "of course , we assume that the net charge is rather small , so that the star is not destroyed by the coulomb force . as shown in @xcite@xcite@xcite even globally neutral stars can develop strong surface electric fields .",
    "for this purpose we rederive the charge - generalization of the pulsation equation .",
    "this equation has already appeared in different notations in the literature . in the present paper",
    "we provide a clear derivation and obtain a simpler expression than those given in @xcite@xcite .",
    "below we apply the derived oscillation equation and present first numerical results obtained with the correct equation .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies we investigate charged stars with a realistic eos .",
    "our results show that the presence of a slight charge inbalance may help to reconcile soft equations of state with observations of massive pulsars . furthermore , an enhancement of the oscillation period at given central baryon density is observed .",
    "presently it is not possible to describe nuclear matter and deconfinied quark matter in an unified approach .",
    "we are forced to calculate each phase separately and match them by a phase transition . here",
    "we will employ the gibbs construction , which corresponds to a small surface tension of nuclear matter . within the gibbs approach there is a coexistence region , where both phases coexist with varying proportions .",
    "this is in contrast to the maxwell construction , where two pure phases meet at one boundary .",
    "in contrast to the maxwell approach , we do not encounter a discontinuity in the density .",
    "this is crucial for the applicapility of the perturbative approach , which requires the smallness of all perturbed quantities , including the fluid pressure and density .",
    "the gibbs condition is more involved , because there are 2 ( ore even more ) independent chemical potentials , each corresponding to one globally conserved charge . in this case",
    "the gibbs condition reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the independent chemical potentials . for the hadronic phase the relativistic mean field model is used , which provides an effective and relativistically invariant description for dense multi - particle systems .",
    "the parameters are fitted to the known properties of nuclear matter at saturation .",
    "we use the tm1 parameter set , which leads to a maximum mass of about @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the quark phase is described by a mit bag model with the free energy @xcite @xmath5 where the first term represents the thermodynamic potentials of non - interacting particles , @xmath6 is the interaction strength and @xmath7 is the bag constant .",
    "below we consider both neutral and charged stars . in the latter case",
    "there is less certainty about the distribution of charge density @xmath8 than about the eos .",
    "while for constant density stars @xmath8 might increase monotonically toward the surface , this distribution is inconsistent with the employed eos described above .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is proportional to the baryon number density .",
    "the total charge is assumed to be small in the sense that the corresponding electrostatic energy is smaller than the gravitational energy , i.e. @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the total baryon number and charge number , respectively .",
    "below we use the parameter @xmath12 , measuring the charge of the star .",
    "in this section we consider radial oscillations of compact stars .",
    "we briefly sketch the derivation of the pulsation equation following chandrasekhar s work @xcite . additionally we allow for a non - vanishing net charge .",
    "the line element of the schwarzschild - like metric is given by @xmath13 where the metric potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 are only functions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "then the einstein tensor is given by @xmath18\\label{c6}\\\\ g_1^{\\;\\;1}&=e^{-2\\lambda}\\left[2r^{-1}\\phi'+r^{-2}\\right]-r^{-2}\\label{c7}\\\\ g_2^{\\;\\;2}&=e^{-2\\lambda}\\left[\\phi''-\\phi'\\lambda'+{\\phi'}^2+r^{-1}\\left(\\phi'-\\lambda'\\right)\\right]\\notag\\\\&+e^{-2\\phi}\\left[\\dot{\\phi}\\dot{\\lambda}-\\ddot{\\lambda}-{\\dot{\\lambda}}^2\\right]\\label{c8}\\\\ g_0^{\\;\\;1}&=2r^{-1}e^{-2\\lambda}\\dot{\\lambda}\\label{c9}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "due to spherical symmetry , @xmath27 is the only nonvanishing component of @xmath26 . for the schwarzschild",
    "metric the enclosed electric charge is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "maxwell s equation @xmath29=4\\pi\\sqrt{-g}j^{\\nu}$ ] relates the enclosed charge to the electric field @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the differential equations for the charge are given by @xmath31 where follows from maxwell s equation and is true by definition .",
    "the nontrivial components of the covariant divergence of the stress - energy tensor are @xmath32 in order to evaluate einstein s equation at equilibrium , we impose stationarity and set the radial velocity to zero .",
    "@xmath33 is the condition of hydro - electrostatic equilibrium derived by bekenstein in @xcite . neglecting nonlinear terms in the perturbations",
    ", the 4-velocity can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 as pointed out in @xcite , it is not justified to replace @xmath14 by @xmath37 in the expressions for @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "if we subtract from the same equation evaluated at equilibrium and keep only terms linear in the perturbations , we obtain @xmath40 @xmath41 is the absolute displacement of a fluid element relative to its equilibrium position .",
    "the time derivative of the displacement @xmath42 is equal to the radial velocity @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath43 assuming that the perturbations obey an harmonic time dependence @xmath44 reduces to @xmath45 where the variables for the perturbations now denote their time - independent amplitudes . is the prototype of the pulsation equation . what remains to be done ,",
    "is to insert in the expressions for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if we inspect the only offdiagonal component of eintein s equation , keep only linear terms and integrate , we arrive at @xmath50 the diagonal components of einstein s equation can be subtracted from their equilibrium values .",
    "after linearization , one obtains @xmath51 where the charge - dependence of @xmath46 in is only implicit .",
    "we assume a barotropic equation of state @xmath52 and define the adiabatic index as @xmath53 therefore @xmath47 is already constrained as @xmath54 if the equation of state is not barotropic and the pressure is a function of the energy density and baryon density , it is possible to define the adiabatic index in such a way @xcite , as to preserve the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . therefore the pulsation equation does not rely on this assumption . with the previous equations ,",

    "we prefer our version , because it is more compact and captures the difference from chandrasekhar s equation in a single term .    ,",

    "a cubic spline interpolation scheme is used for the realistic eos given in tabulated form . to test the validity of our program and eliminate the dependence on the interpolation part",
    ", a comparison was made with the results for the polytropic equation of state @xmath64 given in @xcite . using the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 we observe deviations in @xmath67 below 1% , except for a single star with central energy denisty @xmath68 , for which the relative error in @xmath67 exceeds 13% . in this case",
    "the star is close to the maximum mass configuration and the value of @xmath67 is almost zero , giving rise to the large relative error .",
    "we verified , that the code gives zero oscillation frequency at both extrema in the mass - radius diagram .",
    "the integration of the eigenmode equation on a stellar background with the maxwell phase transition can lead to positive values of @xmath61 , even though @xmath69 . in @xcite",
    "the question was risen , how to align this behavior with the known static stability criterion @xcite .",
    "while not considered in the present study , we argue that in the case of density jumps the eigenmode equation should not be applied through the discontinuity , but rather for each phase separately , with additional boundary conditions at the phase boundary .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m - r_0 ] we show the mass - radius diagramm of neutral hybrid stars for different parameter choices of the quark matter eos .",
    "we vary the value of the bag constant ( upper pannel ) and the @xmath6-parameter ( lower pannel ) , which parameterizes corrections from the strong interaction .",
    "an increase in the bag constant yields higher critical densities for the phase transition . to comply with the mass limit the presence of the mixed phase is limited to a small region at the center .",
    "the associated frequencies are shown in figure  [ fig : osc_0 ] . at the onset of the phase transition",
    "there is a kink in the frequency curve .",
    "the critical central density , for which instability sets in , is shifted to lower values . the mass - radius and frequency diagramms for charged hybrid stars are given in figure  [ fig : m - r_1 ] .",
    "the coulomb repulsion augments the masses and reduces the frequencies of the fundamental radial mode .",
    "this reduction is given at all values of central densities , but is more pronounced above @xmath70 .",
    "the central densities associated with the maximum mass are shifted to lower values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - r_1 ] we show results only for relatively small values of @xmath71 , because at higher @xmath71 the central pressure approaches zero and the star structure should change .",
    "we have constructed models of hadronic and hybrid stars consistent with recent observations @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that the presence of deconfined quarks at the center of hybrid stars reduces the oscillation frequencies of the fundamental radial mode .",
    "we have generalized the equation for radial eigenmodes to the case of charged stars .",
    "the general behavior is a decrease in the oscillation frequency at given central baryon density .",
    "the onset of instability is shifted to lower central densities .",
    "the departure from global charge - neutrality is accompanied by a substancial increase in the gravitational mass .",
    "this stems from the energy of the electric field and the coulomb repulsion , which allows the star to contain more baryons .",
    "the mass increase allows to reconcile the observational constraint with soft equations of state , which are otherwise ruled out .",
    "similar to the case of rotating equilibria , there exists a class of charged supermassive stars , for which there are no neutral stars with the same baryon number .",
    "for completeness we give the oscillation equation in two different notations , encountered in the literature .      in @xcite",
