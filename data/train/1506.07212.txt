    "empirical risk minimization ( erm ) is a domininant framework for supervised machine learning , and a key component of many learning algorithms .",
    "a statistic or _",
    "property _ is simply a functional assigning a vector of values to each distribution .",
    "we say that such a property is _ elicitable _ , if for some loss function it can be represented as the unique minimizer of the expected loss under the distribution .",
    "thus , the study of which properties are elicitable can be viewed as the study of which statistics are computable via erm  @xcite .",
    "the study of property elicitation began in statistics  @xcite , and is gaining momentum in machine learning  @xcite , economics  @xcite , and most recently , finance  @xcite .",
    "a sequence of papers starting with savage  @xcite has looked at the full characterization of losses which elicit the mean of a distribution , or more generally the expectation of a vector - valued random variable  @xcite .",
    "the case of real - valued properties is also now well in hand  @xcite .",
    "the general vector - valued case is still generally open , with recent progress in  @xcite .",
    "recently , a parallel thread of research has been underway in finance , to understand which financial risk measures , among several in use or proposed to help regulate the risks of financial institutions , are computable via regression , i.e. , elicitable ( cf .",
    "references above ) . more often than not",
    ", these papers have concluded that most risk measures under consideration are not elicitable , notable exceptions being generalized quantiles ( e.g. value - at - risk , expectiles ) and expected utility  @xcite .    throughout the growing momentum of the study of elicitation , one question has been central : which properties are elicitable ?",
    "it is clear , however , that all properties are elicitable if one first elicits the distribution using a standard proper scoring rule .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we suggest replacing this question with a more nuanced one : _ how _ elicitable are various properties ? specifically , heeding the suggestion of gneiting  @xcite , we adapt to our setting the notion of _ elicitation complexity _ introduced by lambert et al .",
    "@xcite , which captures how many parameters one needs to maintain in an erm procedure for the property in question . indeed ,",
    "if a real - valued property is found not to be elicitable , such as the variance , one should not abandon it , but rather ask how much effort is required to compute it via erm .",
    "our work is heavily inspired by the recent progress along these lines of fissler and ziegel  @xcite , who show that spectral risk measures of support @xmath0 have elicitation complexity at most @xmath1 .",
    "spectral risk measures are among those under consideration in the finance community , and this result shows that while not elicitable in the classical sense , their elicitation complexity is still low , and hence one can develop reasonable regression procedures for them .",
    "our results extend to these and many other risk measures ( see  [ ex : rockafellar ] ) , often providing matching _ lower bounds _ on the complexity as well .",
    "our contributions are the following .",
    "we first introduce an adapted definition of elicitation complexity which we believe to be the right notion to focus on going forward .",
    "we establish a few simple but useful results which allow for a kind of calculus of elicitation ; for example , conditions under which the complexity of eliciting two properties in tandem is the sum of their individual complexities . in  [ sec : elic - complex - bayes - risk ] , we derive several techniques for proving both upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity which apply primarily to the _ bayes risks _ from decision theory , or optimal expected loss functions .",
    "the class includes spectral risk measures among several others ; see  [ sec : elic - complex - exampl - appl ] .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : elic - complex - cond - elic ] we turn to the case of _ conditional elicitation _",
    ", where a property is elicitable if the correct value of another property is known . complementing the case of the bayes risk , which is conditionally elicitable , we give a necessary condition for the elicitability of a property together with its conditionee .",
    "we conclude with brief remarks and open questions .",
    "let @xmath2 be a set of outcomes and @xmath3 be a convex set of probability measures .",
    "the goal of elicitation is to learn something about the distribution @xmath4 , specifically some function @xmath5 , by minimizing a loss function .",
    "a _ property _ is a function @xmath6 , for some @xmath7 , which associates a correct report value to each distribution .. ] we let @xmath8 denote the set of distributions @xmath9 corresponding to report value @xmath10 .    given a property @xmath11 ,",
    "we want to ensure that the best result is to reveal the value of the property using a _ loss function _ that evaluates the report using a sample from the distribution .",
    "[ def : elic - complex-3 ] a loss function @xmath12 _ elicits _ a property @xmath13 if for all @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "a property is _ elicitable _ if some loss elicits it .",
    "a well - known necessary condition for elicitability is convexity of the level sets of @xmath11 .",
    "[ prop : elic - complex - level - sets - convex ] if @xmath11 is elicitable , the level sets @xmath17 are convex for all @xmath18 .",
    "it is often useful to work with a stronger condition , that not only is @xmath17 convex , but it is the intersection of a subspace with @xmath19 .",
    "this condition is equivalent the existence of an _ identification function _ , a functional describing the level sets of @xmath11  @xcite .",

    "our definition of elicitation complexity differs from the notion proposed by lambert et al .",
    "@xcite , in that the components of @xmath40 above do not need to be individually elicitable .",
    "this turns out to have a large impact , as under their definition the property @xmath41 for finite @xmath2 has elicitation complexity @xmath42 , whereas under our definition @xmath43 ; see example  [ ex : modal - mass ] .",
    "fissler and ziegel  @xcite propose a closer but still different definition , with the complexity being the smallest @xmath0 such that @xmath11 is a component of a @xmath0-dimensional elicitable property .",
    "again , this definition can lead to larger complexities than necessary ; take for example the squared mean @xmath44 ^ 2 $ ] when @xmath45 , which has @xmath46 with @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 , but is not elicitable and thus has complexity 2 under  @xcite .",
    "we believe that , modulo regularity assumptions on @xmath27 , our definition is better suited to studying the difficulty of eliciting properties : viewing @xmath31 as a ( potentially dimension - reducing ) link function , our definition captures the minimum number of parameters needed in an erm computation of the property in question , followed by a simple one - time application of @xmath31 .",
    "as noted , we will restrict our attention to @xmath49 for much of the paper , which effectively requires @xmath50 ; specifically , if @xmath11 is derived from some elicitable @xmath40 , then @xmath40 must be identifiable as well .",
    "this restriction is only relevant for our lower bounds , as our upper bounds give losses explicitly . )",
    "merely requires @xmath11 to have convex level sets , which is necessary by prop .",
    "[ prop : elic - complex - level - sets - convex ] . ]",
    "note however that _ some _ restriction on @xmath27 is necessary , as otherwise pathological constructions giving injective mappings from @xmath51 to @xmath52 would render all properties 1-elicitable . to alleviate this issue , some authors require continuity ( e.g.  @xcite ) while others like we do require identifiability ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which can be motivated by the fact that for any differentiable loss @xmath53 for @xmath11 , @xmath54 will identify @xmath11 provided @xmath55 $ ] has no inflection points or local minima . an important future direction is to relax this identifiability assumption , as there are very natural ( set - valued ) properties with @xmath56 . for a finite measurable partition @xmath57 of @xmath2 . ]      in the remainder of this section , we make some simple , but useful , observations about @xmath58 and @xmath39 .",

    "a concrete case is @xmath63mean squared , variance , 2nd moment@xmath64 , which has @xmath65 ; see example  [ ex : variance ] .",
