    "ideal classical fluids possess a number of conserved quantities such as energy , momentum , angular momentum and kinetic helicity . of these ,",
    "only energy and kinetic helicity correspond to quadratic invariants in the system .",
    "first identified as an invariant for ideal classical fluids by moffatt @xcite , kinetic helicity has been recognized to be related to the topology of the vorticity field in classical fluids . aside from its relevance to classical fluids , helicity also plays an important role in a number of other contexts such as plasmas , cosmic strings , magnetohydrodynamics , and biology@xcite .",
    "if vorticity is concentrated within vortex tubes , the helicity is in part determined by the self - knotting and linking of the vortices within a tangle . in recent years , it has become possible to realize particular cases of knotted vortex tubes produced in water and to study them under controlled conditions in the laboratory@xcite .",
    "this has paved the way to test assertions arising from considerations involving helicity .",
    "recently , tying a simple knot has been experimentally demonstrated even in a bose - einstein condensate of an ultracold atomic bose gas@xcite .",
    "the characteristics of superfluid vortices in such bose gases are essentially identical to vortices that we would expect to form in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "therefore , similar knotted vortex excitations would be expected to arise in superfluid helium although their experimental verification would be more of a challenge since it is only recently that direct visualization of quantized vortices in @xmath0he has become possible using small tracer particles @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical fluids , in superfluids , the vorticity is concentrated along line filaments and the circulation is quantized in units of planck s constant",
    ". moreover , superfluid vortices are not subject to diffusive processes that are present in classical fluids . yet , although superfluid vortices appear to resemble vortices of ideal classical fluids , their topology is not frozen into the flow because quantum effects can act to allow vortices to undergo reconnections . in other words , superfluid vortices",
    "are not constrained by the helmholtz laws of vortex motion . given these observations , it appears that helicity would acquire its simplest form in a superfluid . at the same time , reconnections delineate the boundaries of sharply defined intervals involving constant vortex topologies .",
    "this makes superfluids an ideal setting in which to understand properties of helicity and how it relates to the topology of the superfluid vortex filaments .",
    "numerical studies of knotted vortex structures have previously been performed using both a hydrodynamic description based on a vortex filament model@xcite and a microscopic mean field model in the form of the gross - pitaevskii equation that can directly resolve the core structure@xcite . in superfluids",
    ", the core of a vortex is characterised by a depletion of the density field which vanishes along the centreline of the vortex@xcite . therefore , although superfluid vortices have a finite core size characterized by the rapid variation of the density field , the vorticity remains singular and concentrated along a filament due to the divergent nature of the velocity within the core .",
    "when the core size is much smaller than any other characteristic scale and compressiblity effects can be neglected , one may adopt a vortex filament model in which the dynamics of the superfluid reduces to studying how a vortex or a tangle of vortices evolves .",
    "both these conditions are typically satisfied in @xmath0he . in this case , the vortex core size is of the order of 1  . moreover , since superfluid helium is a liquid , it is much more reasonable to assume that it behaves as an incompressible fluid .",
    "the vortex filament model has served as an excellent description to study the dynamics of vortices in this systems .    since a vortex filament has no internal structure associated with the vorticity field ,",
    "there is no notion of the twisting of the vortex lines within the core of a vortex as is the case for vortex tubes with a cross - sectional area characterising finite extent of the vorticity field .",
    "such a scenario leads to a number of complications when evaluating helicity for a vortex filament .",
    "in particular , it would appear that helicity conservation can not be satisfied , even in between reconnection events .    in this work",
    ", we will show that without introducing the notion of an internal twist , helicity conservation can not be satisfied within the vortex filament model . to introduce internal twist ,",
    "a spanwise vector must be defined along the length of the filament .",
    "we will show that a natural choice is to set the spanwise vector to coincide with a direction of constant velocity potential upon which we are able to recover the key properties of helicity . in superfluids the quantum mechanical phase of the order parameter plays the role of the velocity potential .",
    "we note that similar choices have been suggested also other authors@xcite .",
    "we will illustrate that this choice of the spanwise vector coincides with working in the so - called seifert frame in which case helicity becomes trivially zero @xcite . in this frame ,",
    "the direction of the spanwise vector is related to the tangential component of standard biot - savart velocity along the vortex filament . when the filament is interpreted as a limiting case of a classical vortex tube endowed with internal structure ,",
    "the tangential velocity of the vortex filament is modified .",
    "since the tangential velocity does not affect the overall configuration of the vortices , our definition remains consistent with the vortex dynamics produced by a vortex filament model .",
    "this allows us to generalize our results for superfluid vortices to classical vortices .",
    "in particular , our results will allow us to establish how a quasiclassical limit of helicity can emerge from the microscopic quantum description .",
    "we will begin by recalling some key results concerning helicity in classical fluids .",
    "helicity in fluid dynamics is defined as @xmath1 where the integration is over the whole space where the flow is defined , @xmath2 is the velocity field , and @xmath3 is the corresponding vorticity field . if the vorticity is taken to be concentrated within vortex tubes but is zero otherwise , the helicity will have a topological interpretation . for simplicity , we will consider the scenario where each vortex tube carries the same vorticity flux @xmath4 .",
    "this flux can be identified with the circulation which for quantized vortices is given by @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is planck s constant and @xmath7 is the atomic mass ( e.g.  of the @xmath0he atom ) .",
    "following moffatt and ricca@xcite , we decompose the helicity into the linking number @xmath8 ( where the double summation is over different vortices and @xmath9 is the gauss linking number ) , the writhe @xmath10 , and the twist part of the helicity @xmath11 such that @xmath12    to provide more explicit expressions for these terms , we parameterize a vortex in terms of its arclength @xmath13 so that the position vector of a vortex filament is given by @xmath14 .",
    "it is then natural to introduce the frenet - serret basis given by eqs .   to evaluate the curvature @xmath15 , and torsion @xmath16 of each vortex filament : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are local normal and bi - normal ( unit vectors ) , respectively . here",
    ", primes imply differentiation with respect to arclength . denoting the centreline of the vortex tube @xmath20 with position vector @xmath21 by @xmath22",
    ", we can then identify a unit span - wise vector @xmath23 that determines the twisting of the vortex lines within the vortex tube such that @xmath24 this vector can be attributed to a ribbon like structure that is oriented with respect to the unit normal and and bi - normal vectors . with these definitions ,",
    "the different helicity components can be written as@xcite @xmath25 the use of the frenet - serret equations results in a twist contribution to the helicity that is given by @xmath26 here the torsion part of the twist @xmath27 can be evaluated using the local torsion @xmath28 .",
    "the last term in eq .   describes the internal ( or intrinsic ) twist @xmath29 .",
    "we note that , since @xmath23 is defined in terms of the normal and bi - normal unit - vectors , a constant value of @xmath23 only implies that the total twist is zero",
    ". the internal twist can still be nonzero if torsion is also nonzero .",
    "for closed vortex tubes , both the gauss linking number and the internal twist can only take integer values .",
    "the writhe , the gauss linking number , and the torsion part of the twist do not depend on the way one prescribes the spanwise vector @xmath23 . however , the internal twist depends on the choice for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , once @xmath23 is prescribed , the self - linking number for vortex @xmath20 , which equals @xmath30 , also becomes a topological invariant .",
    "it follows that by redefining @xmath23 we may designate different values to the helicity .",
    "theoretically it has been shown that under continuous deformation of the vortex tube , writhe @xmath31 and total twist @xmath32 vary continuously . however , if at some time @xmath33 a curve passes through an inflectional configuration , i.e. , its curvature @xmath34 vanishes at some point @xmath35 , then the torsion part of the helicity @xmath27 develops a jump of @xmath36 . at the instant when the curve has a point with zero curvature , the local torsion , @xmath37 , diverges around @xmath35 , but this divergence is integrable .",
    "the resulting jump is compensated by a jump in the internal twist of @xmath38 .",
    "when the superfluid is described by a complex wavefunction ( order parameter @xmath39 ) then vorticity can arise only in the form of line - like topological defects .",
    "for pure line vortices ( i.e.  neglecting other excitations in the superfluid ) , the corresponding velocity potential @xmath40 can be identified with the phase of the order parameter such that @xmath41 . in this case , the phase is well defined everywhere , except at the vortex cores where the vorticity is non - zero .",
    "if we ignore compressibility effects and focus on the incompressible motion given by the vortices that correspond to pure line defects , the superfluid velocity can be calculated using the standard biot - savart law @xmath42 where the integration is carried out along all the vortex lines .",
    "this equation can be directly applied at any point @xmath43 ( i.e.  not lying on a vortex ) . at a point @xmath44",
    ", the divergent integrand implies that the normal and binormal components of the velocity are not well defined at the vortex line .",
    "in contrast , the tangential component of @xmath45 remains well - behaved .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented by regularizing the integral in the vicinity of the point on a vortex as will be described in sec .",
    "[ s.dvfm ] .    if the biot - savart integral is inserted into the eq .   for the helicity",
    ", we appear to recover only the linking number and the writhe terms .",
    "therefore , by using the above expression for the biot - savart velocity it seems that the helicity is not the same as the one presented earlier in sec .",
    "[ s.helicity ] .",
    "although a vortex filament has no internal core structure , on physical grounds a vortex is endowed with a scalar field , the velocity potential that permits us to identify a spanwise vector to a direction of constant phase@xcite .",
    "the direction of the constant phase ( or velocity potential ) of the complex wavefunction has also been proposed by others as a possible direction that can be used to define @xmath23 for superfluid vortices@xcite .",
    "this choice for the @xmath23 turns out to be equivalent to using the so - called seifert framing@xcite .",
    "this particular framing is special because the total helicity is always zero when evaluated in this frame@xcite . with @xmath23",
    "as defined , it is now possible to recover a torsion and internal twist contribution to helicity . to see how this arises",
    ", we note that in the seifert framing we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents a point located near a point @xmath21 lying on the vortex . here",
    "@xmath48 is proportional to the superfluid velocity , which is normal to surfaces of constant phase near a vortex . by construction , on the curve",
    "@xmath49 given by @xmath50 the phase is constant so that we can write @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the tangent for the curve @xmath49 . in the limit @xmath55 , @xmath49 and @xmath56",
    "coincide and the tangent vector @xmath57 then approaches the tangent @xmath58 of the vortex line @xmath56 .",
    "however , the above can not be used to deduce that the tangential biot - savart velocity along the vortex is zero .",
    "this is because , even if the azimuthal component ( component around the vortex centreline ) of @xmath59 goes to zero , the azimuthal component of the velocity diverges .",
    "therefore , a more detailed analysis is required to determine the tangential velocity along the filament . by using the chain rule",
    "we can express @xmath59 as @xmath60 after inserting the definition for @xmath23 given by eq .  , and applying the frenet - serret equations , plus noting that the local azimuthal direction around the vortex tangent is given by @xmath61 , the above equation for @xmath59 simplifies to @xmath62 where @xmath63 describes the rate of rotation of the spanwise vector around the local tangent @xmath58 . in arriving at the final expression given in eq .",
    ", we have assumed that the local curvature satisfies the condition @xmath64 , and we have used the unit normalization to determine the value for the common factor , @xmath65 .    we would expect that the leading order terms for the biot - savart velocity at @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 now substituting eqs .   and into eq .   and",
    "taking the limit @xmath55 , we obtain that @xmath68 this implies that we may obtain the internal twist angle @xmath69 after calculating the tangential component of the biot - savart velocity and the local torsion .    to clarify the relation between classical and quantum vortices , in order to establish how a quasiclassical limit can arise from the quantum case , let us consider the scenario of a classical vortex tube with a finite but small cross - sectional area .",
    "as shown by moffatt and ricca@xcite , for a vortex with a finite core , it is possible to relate the twist of the vorticity flux lines to the twist of the spanwise vector in the equation for the helicity .",
    "thus , in contrast to a quantum vortex , for a classical vortex , the twist @xmath70 , defined in eq .  , originates from the azimuthal component of the vorticity .    in the case",
    "when the characteristic length scale along the vortex tube is much larger than the vortex core , it may be convenient to use a filament representation and study the dynamics of how the centreline vorticity evolves .",
    "however , this filament description of a vortex tube follows from a scale separation assumption rather than being an intrinsic representation of the actual vorticity field .",
    "a key difference with a superfluid vortex is that the internal vorticity structure now gives rise to a component of velocity along the centreline of the vortex tube .",
    "the total velocity for a vortex filament used to model a thin vortex tube is therefore given by @xmath71 the additional tangential twist velocity arising from the twisting of the vortex flux lines is given by @xmath72 here @xmath28 is the local torsion at @xmath13 and @xmath23 describes the rotation of the vorticity fluxlines inside the vortex core , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.twistkw ] .",
    "if the cross - sectional area of the vortex tube is assumed to remain constant along its length , then together with the assumption of incompressibility the @xmath73 velocity would need to be constant on each vortex@xcite .",
    "the helicity conservation would then fix the time dependence of @xmath73 .",
    "we can now see that if the total tangential velocity is zero everywhere on the vortex , we recover eq .   for the internal twist angle that was obtained by using the seifert frame for superfluid vortex filaments .",
    "since the vorticity of a superfluid vortex does not have an azimuthal component , superfluid vortices do not have an additional intrinsic degree of freedom that can be ascribed to classical vortices .",
    "therefore , in the seifert frame , the helicity of a superfluid vortex is always zero .",
    "in contrast , @xmath23 is determined by the structure of the vorticity field within the core of a classical vortex and , as such , the helicity is not necessarily the same as for a superfluid vortex .    by assuming that the helicity would remain zero also for the classical case , and that the twist velocity remains constant along the filament as required by incompressibility , the internal twist angle for vortex @xmath20",
    "is obtained using the following equation : @xmath74 here @xmath75 denotes the length of vortex @xmath20 .",
    "if we want that the helicity is simply given by linking , one should only replace @xmath45 in eq .   with the velocity caused by vortex @xmath20 alone , i.e. , set @xmath76 .",
    "both eqs .   and",
    "give zero helicity and the same value for the total twist @xmath70 .",
    "the difference appears only in the local value of the internal twist angle , i.e. , the frame in the classical case is generally different from the seifert case since it is associated with the structure of the vorticity within the core .       around the vortex centreline .",
    "this direction would coincide with the rotation of the vorticity flux lines inside the vortex core of a classical vortex . for a superfluid , this vector coincides with the direction of the constant phase of the order parameter deep within the vortex . for a straight vortex ,",

    "initially , we will focus on idealised vortex configurations to elucidate the different properties of helicity in order to facilitate our understanding of how helicity behaves in more realistic situations .",
    "a straight vortex with only an azimuthal velocity field around its core has zero helicity .",
    "we will , therefore , consider perturbations on an otherwise straight vortex in the form of a helical kelvin wave with amplitude @xmath77 , i.e. : @xmath78 the last equation relates @xmath79 to the arc length @xmath13 . the unit tangent @xmath80 , principal normal @xmath18 , and bi - normal @xmath19",
    "are then given by @xmath81 in this case , the local torsion is constant and equal to @xmath82 , as would be expected for a simple helix .",

    "we note that the formulation given by eq .",
    ", obtained by using the ( constant ) twist velocity , gives exactly the same value for the internal twist angle as the formulation using the seifert frame , eq .  .",
    "by setting the integration constant @xmath88 , we can show that the spanwise vector becomes @xmath89    therefore , for small amplitudes @xmath90 .",

    "so the quasiclassical notion of helicity is not tied to the seifert frame but emerges from the linking of vortex lines within the bundle .",
    "this is consistent with our observation in section [ s.hvfm ] that for a classical vortex tube , the twist is determined by the vorticity within the core and is unrelated to the seifert frame .",

    ", we evaluated how the centreline writhe and the twist varied with time as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.bundleh ] . as can be seen ,",
    "although the writhe and twist vary , their sum remains essentially constant .",
    "the jumps in the centreline torsion are again due to inflections points in the centreline and are compensated by the internal twist .",
    "the noise in the total helicity is partly caused by the finite resolution which softens the jumps in the torsion but also because the bundle is loosing its coherence at later times .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ f.bundleconfs]a , the different vortices remain as single - valued functions of the azimuthal angle .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ f.bundleconfs]b , steepening of the kelvin waves on individual vortices destroys the coherent alignment of the vortices . despite this",
    ", we note that since the helicity is approximately conserved and that the twist was evaluated from the rotation of the vortices within the bundle about the centreline , as described in sec .",
    "[ s.bundle ] , our results provide direct evidence of the emergence of a nontrivial quasiclassical helicity as an invariant of coherent vortex bundles .",
    "when decomposing helicity into its constitent contributions , linking number , writhe , torsion , and internal twist , we find that the first three are completely prescribed by the instantaneous configuration of a vortex filament , whereas internal twist requires a spanwise vector to be defined .",
    "the sum of the first three contributions is an integer value and varies only when inflection points appear . in that regard , the torsion contribution to the helicity",
    "should always be retained when evaluating the helicity of a superfluid vortex which would otherwise never remain conserved under deformations of the vortex ( even those that do not form inflection points ) as was found in ref .  [ ] where only the writhe contribution was retained .    at zero temperature the lia ( localized induction approximation ) , where only the local term of eq .",
    "is retained , possesses an infinite number of invariants , one of them being the integral of the torsion over the vortex length .",
    "this conservation of the torsion requires that inflection points appear in pairs , one contributing a change of @xmath126 to @xmath27 and the other giving a change of @xmath127 . in other words",
    "the internal twist remains constant during the lia dynamics .",
    "inclusion of the internal twist restores helicity conservation even when inflection points are formed .",
    "defining the twist using the direction of the phase precludes the possibility of having an isolated twisted vortex ring .",
    "the phase of a twisted circular superfluid vortex would have a singularity at the centre .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional definition of the twist .",
    "a circular vortex tube may be twisted , as illustrated by our bundle calculations where the tube is modeled by using seven vortices .",
    "the twisting of vorticity lines inside the tube induces a velocity along the vortex , but does not change the velocity potential outside the vortex tube .    whether the seifert framing for superfluid vortices could be justified from first principles is left as an open question in this work .",
    "however , it appears to be a reasonable choice from at least three physical points .",
    "firstly , it provides an unambiguous means to define the spanwise vector @xmath23 that remains well - defined throughout the dynamics and in doing so it restores many of the characteristics of helicity that are known to hold for vortices in classical fluids .",
    "secondly , it ensures helicity is conserved throughout the dynamics for superfluids even during reconnection events even though the different contributions would change to reflect the changing topology of the vortex lines .",
    "a consequence of the seifert framing is that this choice connects the linking with the internal twist .",
    "for example , two vortex rings which separately have zero twist , become twisted if linked ( e.g. a hopf link ) . for an illustration ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ f.spanwiserings ] .",
    "thirdly and most significantly , we have shown how a nontrivial quasiclassical limit of helicity can emerge that is independent of the seifert framing .",
    "the dynamics of quantized vortices is typically modelled with the filament model@xcite such that the vortices are considered as thin tubes with cylindrically symmetric cores where the circulation generates a classical magnus force .",
    "given the extremely small vortex core , we may ignore the small effective mass of the vortex although in general this effect can become more important at very low temperatures and on scales comparable to the core size . at finite temperatures ,",
    "one additionally needs to consider dissipation due to the mutual friction that couples the superfluid and normal components together .",
    "setting the sum of the magnus and mutual friction forces equal to zero results in the following equation of motion for the vortex lines : @xmath128 \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath129 corresponds to the normal fluid velocity while @xmath130 corresponds to the superfluid velocity which is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 corresponds to some externally imposed irrotational superflow which we set equal to zero .",
    "both the normal @xmath133 and superfluid @xmath134 velocities are evaluated at the vortex ( centreline ) , @xmath21 , whereas derivatives are evaluated with respect to the arc length , such that @xmath135 corresponds to the unit tangent vector .",
    "the two parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 represent mutual friction coefficients that depend on temperature and pressure . the effect of the corresponding terms is to damp out excitations such as kelvin waves on the vortices . for calculations at finite temperature we also ignore the coupling from superfluid vortices on the normal component and take @xmath136 .",
    "this approximation is especially suitable in superfluid @xmath137he where the viscosity of the normal component is high .",
    "since we need to evaluate the superfluid velocity along the vortex centreline , we must introduce a cutoff to avoid the singularities in the superfluid velocity field arising from the divergent terms appearing in eq .   for @xmath45 .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing a finite core size cut - off . this way",
    "the singularity in the azimuthal component of the velocity ( as mentioned above , the tangential component of @xmath45 is regular ) can be avoided and the biot - savart velocity at a vortex point becomes @xmath138 here the derivates are again with respect to arc length @xmath13 , and the integral omits the short segments @xmath139 around the point @xmath21 .",
    "the first term is called the local term and it produces a velocity along the bi - normal with amplitude proportional to local curvature @xmath140 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath141 is the vortex core size and the @xmath142-parameter is related to the core structure , being 1/4 for a solid rotating core model ( rankine vortex ) and 1/2 for a hollow core vortex .",
    "it is tuned such that the local term gives the same velocity for a vortex ring ( or its local segment ) as that of a classical vortex ring with a similar core structure .",
    "the approximation made for the local term is valid when @xmath143 .      for the initial configuration we used a bundle of seven vortices where the centremost vortex , which initially is also the centreline , had a shape of the ring with a kelvin - wave , eq .",
    "we set @xmath97 = 1 mm , and @xmath77 = 0.1 mm .",
    "the twist of the bundle was achieved by twisting the 6 outermost vortices by 3 times ( corresponding to an angle of @xmath144 ) with respect to the untwisted bundle , which can be obtained by setting the 6 outermost vortices at directions determined by the constant phase directions of @xmath145 , of the centre vortex ( calculated when omitting the effect of the outer vortices ) . the twisting angle with respect to this untwisted configuration",
    "was chosen to depend linearly on the arc - length along the centreline .",
    "the distance of the outermost vortices from the centre vortex was 0.1 mm .",
    "around 7000 points where used to discretise the vortices .",
    "these parameters were chosen primarily due to constraints set by the numerics .    during the time evolution of the vortex bundle the centreline was determined by averaging over the azimuthal locations of the seven different vortices .",
    "when deformations from a circle are not too large , this approximation is suitable . when evaluating the internal twist for the bundle ,",
    "the direction of the different vortices with respect to the serret - frenet basis of the centreline was determined . in other words ,",
    "the angle , @xmath69 , appearing in eq .  , was calculated for each vortex as a function of the length along the centreline by determining the crossing point of each vortex on the plane determined by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "as long as the bundle remains coherent the twist of the different vortices remains the same .",
    "the only exception was the centremost vortex , which initially determined the centreline .",
    "because the centremost vortex may be very close to the centreline , the twist was determined using only the initially six outermost vortices .",
