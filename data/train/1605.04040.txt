    "there is an accumulating body of evidence to suggest that the lines of sight to the compact central regions of some active galaxies exhibit significantly variable absorption due to changes in the column of both neutral and ionized hydrogen .",
    "modelling of the broadband spectra of pks1718 - 649 over the range 0.15 - 10ghz has revealed evidence for changes in its free - free opacity on timescales of months to years @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of the centres of the regions associated with agn activity exhibit large ( @xmath6% ) changes in @xmath7 on timescales between days and weeks ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "there is also some evidence for variations in the hi optical depths of some radio sources @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of each of these individual absorption effects has hitherto been treated in isolation .",
    "a common theme of existing models involves the passage of clouds across the line of sight to a source which is presumed to be relatively compact in angular extent . @xcite",
    "considered a model for the spectrum of a source obscured by free - free absorption due to a population of clouds whose optical depths follow a power - law distribution , although they did not explicitly compute the statistics of the temporal variations associated with their model .",
    "@xcite present cloud - based models to account for the variable x - ray photoelectric absorption observed in several sources .",
    "as the evidence for hi spectral variability is presently tenuous , there has been little systematic attempt to model it or to deduce its implications for agn environments , however @xcite and @xcite suggest various cloud - based models as explanations .    the purpose of this paper is to present a unified framework for the interpretation of absorption variability towards the cores of radio agn",
    "the ultimate aim of such an approach is to deduce the composition of the multi - phase medium in the vicinity of active nuclei .",
    "this presents a means to ascertain what relation exists , if any , between the absorbing structures responsible for the hi , free - free and , ultimately , x - ray absorption . at first glance the basis for the approach may appear unsound because the ionization fraction of the medium might be expected to change rapidly with distance from the nucleus , so that the structures which dominate each type of absorption are physically unconnected .",
    "the rapid variability timescale of x - ray variations suggests that the absorption occurs very close to the central engine , whereas the month- to year - timescale hi and free - free variations are indicative of larger structures . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear - cut that the medium surrounding the central engine should be cleanly stratified into layers : the turbulent energy that exists in this environment should stir up the medium to prevent a clear delineation of the various phases , so that all phases are spatially co - existent .",
    "a rigorous framework provides the basis on which to interpret the opacity variations to make firm deductions about the veracity of either scenario . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to opacity variations at radio wavelengths for two reasons : ( i ) radio - based diagnostics themselves are sufficient to identify the relation between the distribution of neutral and ionized hydrogen , and ( ii ) there are likely to be strong differences in the structure and location of the x - ray and radio - emitting background sources which would hinder quantitative comparison of the absorption diagnostics .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that , although x - ray observations of agn have been undertaken with day to week cadences , radio observations of spectral variability due to free - free and hi absorption processes have not been made with such high cadences .",
    "this paper explores the motivation to investigate this observational regime .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section ",
    "[ sec : themodel ] we present a general model for absorption by an ensemble of clouds . in section ",
    "[ sec : cloudssection ] we link the characteristics of the clouds with their ensemble - average variability properties .",
    "we use this model to explore the significance of temporal variability between the various absorption - based radio - wavelength diagnostics . in section  [ sec : discussion ] we demonstrate how the model may be used to glean information from existing variability data . our conclusions are presented in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the power spectrum of temporal intensity fluctuations due to the passage of a distribution of absorbing material across the line of sight to a background source , as depicted in figure [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "consider an absorbing medium at an angular diameter distance @xmath8 with an angular distribution of opacity @xmath9 across the sky that drifts at some angular speed @xmath10 across the line of sight to a source whose brightness distribution is @xmath11 .",
    "we approximate the opacity fluctuations to be `` frozen - in '' to a moving screen , which means that we take the motions of absorbing clouds relative to one another to be small compared to the speed at which the overall pattern traverses the line of sight . the opacity distribution at a time @xmath12",

    "this condition is easily satisfied for most species since the brightness temperature of the background source is expected to be within a few orders of magnitude of the inverse compton limit ( @xmath19k ) .",
    "the foregoing formalism also admits in a restricted sense the treatment of opacity fluctuations associated with any relativistic synchrotron - emitting gas that may be present in the foreground of the radio source .",
    "specifically , we may examine the distribution of relativistic gas in the vicinity of the hi and free - free absorbing media using this formalism if the brightness temperature of the synchrotron - emitting gas is substantially less than that of the background source . in this instance",
    "we may treat the fluctuations in the synchrotron optical depth in a similar manner to the free - free opacity variations in our formalism below .",
    "in general the exact angular distribution of @xmath20 is unknown _ a priori _ , but it is possible to describe the temporal flux density variations in terms of the corresponding power spectrum , or cross - power spectrum when comparing absorption at two different frequencies , @xmath14 and @xmath21 .",
    "the power spectrum characterises the temporal variations associated with hi or free - free absorption alone .",
    "the cross - power spectrum compares hi absorption intensity changes with intensity changes due to the free - free opacity .",
    "the objective is to relate the temporal spectrum to the underlying statistical properties of the opacity distributions .    in the following discussion it is useful to define the functions @xmath22 , which measure the cross - correlation of the opacity fluctuations between frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath21 on a scale @xmath23 .",

    "to gain further insight into the physics we introduce specific models for the structure of the medium in the following section .",
    "the particular choice of a specific model , involving an ensemble of discrete clouds for the structure of the absorbing region , is adopted here because it connects in a theoretical sense to the work of @xcite in terms of the modelling of gps / css radio spectra .",

    "we assume that the distribution of the cloud positions varies at most weakly over this region ( i.e.  the average cloud density changes at most slowly over the entire region ) , so that the joint probability can be expressed as a function of separation , @xmath99 , and is independent of the average cloud position @xmath100 .",

    "the temporal power spectrum is approximately flat for angular frequencies @xmath153 and then declines as @xmath154 until the source size cuts the spectrum off near @xmath155 .",
    "the power - law portion of the spectrum is not evident if the source is sufficiently large , @xmath156 ( i.e.if the angular size of the source exceeds the the outer scale of the fluctuations in optical depth ) .",

    "the spatial cross - power spectrum becomes negative ; in other words , there is a negative correlation between the hi and free - free structure on very fine scales .",
    "this is to be expected given that the neutral and ionized media are not co - located within each cloud .",
    "the lowest spatial wavenumber at which this occurs is obtained by expanding @xmath167 to second order in @xmath159 , and we find that the zero - crossing points of the cross - spectrum are well - approximated by the solution to the equation @xmath168",

    "in principle measurements of the temporal spectra of opacity variations due to hi and free - free absorption in front of compact radio sources offer a means of discerning the fine - scale spatial structure of the media in external galaxies , and the cross - power spectrum offers a means of discerning the relationship between the spatial distribution of their neutral and ionized phases .",
    "however , two factors hamper our ability to determine the details of the spatial distribution from temporal opacity variations : the first is that the temporal variations integrate over the spectrum of spatial fluctuations in the direction orthogonal to the drift velocity .",

    "we stress that the underlying spatial power- and cross - spectra of hi and free - free opacity variations should be regarded as the fundamental quantities of interest . in this sense",
    "the two cloud models considered in this paper represent extremes of a range of possible models for the spatial distribution of ionized and neutral material in the circumnuclear regions of external galaxies .",
    "these models for the spatial distribution of matter provide a means of forward - modelling the temporal spectra , and their purpose is to provide a physical context in which to interpret the results of the temporal variations .      as an illustration of the foregoing results , we consider the nearby ( @xmath204 , @xmath205mpc ) gps source pks1718@xmath206649 , whose changes in flux density and spectral shape in the range @xmath207-@xmath208ghz were interpreted as evidence of variations in the free - free opacity by @xcite .",
    "the source was observed at three epochs over a 21 month period , and the 0.5jy flux density change observed at 1 ghz over this period implies an opacity change of @xmath209 .",
    "parkes observations at 725mhz and mwa observations at 199mhz further constrain the spectral shape and appear to exclude simple models that involve homogeneous absorbing material .",
    "this provides strong motivation to consider whether spatial inhomogeneity in the free - free opacity in the foreground of the source is consistent with the temporal variations observed .",
    "an estimate of the viability of this mechanism depends crucially on the actual timescale of the variations and on the source size , which determines the expected variability timescale .",

    "the distance of the source 1mas corresponds to a linear scale of 0.28pc .",
    "we place a lower limit on the the expected crossing time of @xmath215 where we have normalised the source size to the angular size of the minor axis of the nw lobe and where @xmath216 is the apparent relative speed between the emitting material and the foreground absorbing medium .",
    "the low brightness temperatures of the components of the sources relative to the inverse compton limit suggests that the emission is not relativistically beamed .",
    "thus the apparent crossing velocity of material across the source is likely @xmath217 .",
    "a timescale much greater than a year is expected if the jet is highly frustrated by dense material along its axis , so that the bulk of the emission moves slowly across the emitting source .",
    "an upper limit to the timescale is obtained by assuming an apparent relative speed @xmath218kms@xmath4 , characteristic for absorbing clouds orbiting a stationary radio - emitting nuclear region , yielding an expected variability timescale of @xmath219years . clearly , multi - epoch vlbi measurements of the source structure are necessary to place limits on the apparent speed of emitting material within the source . thus ,",
    "although present data is insufficient to predict a variability timescale , we can at least conclude that the model is consistent with present constraints on the observed variations .",
    "we have presented a formalism for interpreting the temporal variations in hi and free - free opacity observed in some young , compact radio sources and for connecting these with the underlying properties of the circumnuclear media of their host galaxies .",
    "the theory is , however , more widely applicable to any medium comprised of ionized and neutral material drifting in front of a radio source at a fixed velocity .",
    "the background source structure acts as a low pass filter on the opacity variations observable against these sources and limits the timescales of variations and minimum size of the structures probed within the medium . for drift rates of @xmath3kms@xmath4 against sources of brightness temperatures",
    "@xmath5k the expected timescale of variability is of order years to decades .",
    "much faster variations are possible against radio - emitting outbursts with apparently superluminal speeds , giving rise to variations on timescales @xmath220 times smaller ( i.e. of order days to weeks ) . however , such motions are not thought to be relevant to some young radio sources in which free - free opacity variations are believed to occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the expected timescale is potentially an important distinguishing feature of this model relative to other proposed variability mechanisms , particularly those related to interstellar scintillation , which typically gives rise to variations on day to several - week timescales ; apparent absorption variations can result from the scintillation of the flux density associated with any fine - scale angular structure imprinted in the image of a source by structure in the foreground absorbing medium .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion as it applies to several - week timescale variations in hi",
    ".    measurements of the power- and cross - power spectrum of intensity fluctuations associated with the hi and free - free opacity variations can resolve the nature of the spatial relationship between the two phases .",
    "we have investigated two contrasting models for their distribution  one based on clouds with gaussian density profiles , and another based on clouds comprised of neutral cores with ionized sheaths  and shown how the power spectra of temporal intensity fluctuations differs between the two cases",
    ". however , source structure limits the angular scales accessible to @xmath221 so that , if the ionized and neutral medium is predominately distinguishable only on scales smaller than this , then these scales will not be accessible through measurements of temporal opacity fluctuations .",
