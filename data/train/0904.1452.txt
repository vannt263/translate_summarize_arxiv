    "blazars , including bl lac objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , characterized by strong and rapid variability , high polarization , and apparent superluminal motion .",
    "these extreme properties are generally interpreted as a consequence of non - thermal emission from a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight . as such",
    ", they represent a fortuitous natural laboratory with which to study the physical properties of jets , and , ultimately , the mechanisms of energy extraction from the central supermassive black holes .",
    "the most prominent characteristic of the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is the double - peak structure with two broad spectral components .",
    "the first , lower frequency component is generally interpreted as being due to synchrotron emission , and the second , higher frequency one as being due to inverse compton emission .",
    "bl lac objects ( bl lacs ) usually have no or only very weak emission lines , but have a strong highly variable and polarized non - thermal continuum emission ranging from radio to @xmath6-ray band , and their jets have synchrotron peak frequencies ranging from ir / optical to uv / soft - x - ray energies . compared to bl lacs ,",
    "fsrqs have strong narrow and broad emission lines , however generally have low synchrotron peak frequency .",
    "according to the synchrotron peak frequency , bl lac objects can be divided into three subclasses , i.e. low frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbl ) , intermediate objects ( ibl ) and high frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbl ) @xcite . in general , radio - selected bl lacs tend to be lbls , and xbls are hbls @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have proposed the well - known ` blazar sequence ' , which plot various powers vs the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath3 including fsrqs and bl lacs . they draw a conclusion that the peak frequency seem to be anti - correlated with the source power with the most powerful sources having the relatively small @xmath3 and the least powerful ones having the highest @xmath3 . @xcite gave a theoretical interpretation to these anti - correlations , namely , the more powerful sources suffered a larger probability of losing energy , the more cooling the sources subjected , thus translates into a lower value of @xmath3 .    however , recently the blazar sequence has been largely in debates . by constructing a large sample of about 500 blazars from the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) and the rosat all - sky survey - green bank survey ( rgb )",
    ", @xcite found that the `` x - ray - strong '' radio quasars , with similar sed to that of hbls , have much higher synchrotron peak frequencies than those of classical fsrqs .",
    "their dxrbs sample does not show the expected blazar sequence .",
    "exceptions to blazar sequences were also found by @xcite that most of the low radio luminosity sources have synchrotron peaks at low frequencies , instead of the expected high frequencies in their blazar sample .",
    "they claimed that at least part of the systematic trend seen by @xcite and @xcite results from selection effects .",
    "@xcite have studied a sample of over 300 bl lacs objects , of which 22 objects have high @xmath7 hz",
    ". there are negative correlations between @xmath8 and the luminosity at 5 ghz , 37 ghz , and 5500@xmath9 , however , the correlation turns to slightly positive in x - ray band .",
    "moreover , they claimed that there is no significant correlation between source luminosity at synchrotron peak frequency and @xmath3 , and several low energy peaked bl lacs with low radio luminosity were also found . by using the results of very recent surveys",
    ", @xcite claimed that there is no anti - correlation between the radio power and synchrotron peak frequency in blazars once selection effects are properly taken into account , and some blazars were found to have low power as well as low @xmath3 , or high power and high @xmath3 as well .",
    "furthermore , fsrqs with synchrotron peak frequency in the uv / x - ray band have been claimed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in summary",
    ", it seems that the blazar sequence in its simplest form can not be valid @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dependence of synchrotron peak frequency on the peak luminosity for a sample of fsrqs selected from sdss dr3 quasar catalogue .",
    "the advantage of our sample is that the sdss spectra enable us to measure the various broad emission lines , and then to estimate the black hole mass and the broad line region luminosity .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the synchrotron peak frequency and black hole mass and eddington ratio can be explored , which might have potential importance for us to study the jet formation and physics and the jet - disk relation .",
    "we present the sample selection in @xmath10 2 .",
    "the reduction of sdss spectra and the estimation of black hole mass and broad line region luminosity are described in @xmath10 3 .",
    "the derivation of synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity are given in @xmath10 4 , in which the thermal emission from accretion disc and host galaxy are also calculated . the various correlation analysis",
    "are shown in @xmath10 5 , of which we focus on the relationship between the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity .",

    "the gb6 survey at 4.85 ghz was executed with the 91 m green bank telescope in 1986 november and 1987 october .",
    "data from both epochs were assembled into a survey covering the @xmath32 sky down to a limiting flux of 18 mjy , with @xmath33 resolution .",
    "gb6 contains over 75,000 sources , and has a positional uncertainty of about @xmath34 at the bright end and about @xmath35 for faint sources @xcite .",
    "the sample of 3366 quasars was firstly cross - correlated between the sdss quasar positions and the first catalogue within 2 arcsec ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , resulting in a sample of 516 quasars .",
    "these 516 quasars were further cross - correlated between the sdss quasar positions and the gb6 catalogue within 1 arcmin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a significant correlation is present with a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath155 at confidence level @xmath130 , which remains in partial correlation analysis to exclude the common dependence on redshift .",
    "the ordinary least - square ( ols ) bisector linear fit gives , @xmath156 our result implies a tight relation between jet and disk , which is consistent with previous findings in various occasions , from the strong correlations either between the radio emission and emission line luminosity ( e.g. rawlings et al .",
    "1989 ; cao & jiang 2001 ) , or between the emission line luminosity and jet kinetic power in different scales ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; celotti & fabian 1993 ; wang et al .",

    "our result is consistent with the nearly proportional relation , @xmath157 , found between the jet bulk kinetic power and narrow line luminosity ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",

    "it would be necessary to improve our result using intrinsic parameters , either the intrinsic synchrotron peak luminosity after eliminating the beaming effect , or the jet power .",
    "according to the blazar sequence , fsrqs with high synchrotron peak frequency , e.g. @xmath123 hz , and x - rays dominated by synchrotron emission are not expected to exist . due to its importance",
    ", such objects have been extensively searched ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the discoveries of such blazars have been claimed , however , mainly on the basis of their broad spectral indices , i.e. the ratios of radio / optical / x - ray fluxes @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the x - ray spectroscopy is required to confirm the nature of the x - ray emission in these blazars . in its simplest form",
    ", a x - ray spectral index of @xmath158 indicates a inverse compton origin , while @xmath159 for synchrotron x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite investigate the x - ray spectra for a sample of 10 x - ray selected fsrqs from the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) and four controversial sources claimed to have synchrotron x - ray emission .",
    "they found that , in the case of the emss broad line blazars , x - ray selection does not lead to find sources with synchrotron peaks in the uv / x - ray range , as was the case for x - ray - selected bl lacs . instead ,",
    "for a wide range of radio powers all the sources with broad emission lines show similar seds , with synchrotron components peaking below the optical / uv range .",
    "moreover , the authors argued that four ` anomalous ' blazars are no longer ` anomalous ' after a complete analysis of @xmath160 and @xmath161 data , with two sources having inverse compton x - rays , one source being hbl , and the remaining one being narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy without unambiguous evidence of x - ray emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "similarly , the @xmath162 and @xmath163 x - ray spectroscopy of 10 fsrqs were investigated by @xcite , which are candidates to have an x - ray spectrum dominated by jet synchrotron emission . however , the authors failed to find fsrqs with x - ray spectra dominated by jet synchrotron emission , instead , the x - rays are either from inverse compton or are at transition between the synchrotron and inverse compton jet components as in ibls .",
    "so , despite the efforts to search for objects which may violate the sequence trends no strong outliers have been found ( maraschi et al .",
    "2008 ) . as a severe challenge to blazar sequence , the selection of important candidates of high @xmath3 luminous fsrqs",
    "are refined to choose highly core - dominated radio quasars with low radio core to x - ray luminosity ratios , e.g. log @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the inverse compton emission is expected to peak at @xmath165-ray frequencies , therefore , the high energy - peaked fsrqs could be prime targets for the fermi gamma - ray telescope @xcite .",
    "although the high energy - peaked fsrqs are not firmly found yet , @xcite proposed a model to explain the existence of blue quasars . in their scenario ,",
    "the jet dissipation region is out of the broad line region , resulting in a much reduced energy density of blr photons in jet region .",
    "therefore , the cooling due to the inverse compton process is not severe , causing a high synchrotron peak frequency though the source luminosity is high .",
    "although the anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath101 for the combined sample of 288 blazars ( fig . [ allnulup.ps ] ) is significant , it largely differs with the blazar sequence in its significant scatter , which indicates that the synchrotron peak luminosity can not explicitly determine the synchrotron peak frequency , and vice verse .",
    "the advantages of using the synchrotron peak luminosity is that the most of synchrotron emission are radiated at synchrotron peak frequency , at which the luminosity can be a good indicator of synchrotron emission .",
    "since the synchrotron peak frequency varies from source to source , the luminosity at fixed wavebands ( e.g. optical ) is actually from the different portion of source sed .",
    "the defect of the synchrotron peak luminosity lies in the contamination from beaming effect , which precludes it to well indicate the intrinsic source power .",
    "only when the doppler boosting is known for each source , the intrinsic source power can be obtained .",
    "this can not be performed at present stage . however , this effect has been explored through eliminating the doppler boosting in blazar samples .",
    "interestingly , recent studies have shown that the negative correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath101 is likely an artefact of doppler boosting @xcite . according to these authors ,",
    "the negative correlation is not present when the intrinsic parameters are used , conversely , a positive correlation is claimed .",
    "the key point in these studies is the strong anti - correlation between the doppler factor and synchrotron peak frequency in the way that the sources with their synchrotron peak at low energies are significantly more boosted than high @xmath3 sources , which is found either from the variability doppler factor @xcite or from the one estimated with empirical relation @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the magnetic field , @xmath168 the doppler factor , and @xmath169 a characteristic electron energy that is determined by a competition between accelerating and cooling processes .",
    "different from bl lacs , the external inverse compton scattering is thought to be the dominant cooling process in fsrqs , especially that upon blr photons . through model fitting to blazar seds ,",
    "the electron peak energy is found to be well anti - correlated with the total energy density ( radiative and magnetic ) , which is thought to be the physics behind the phenomenological blazar sequence @xcite .",
    "more energy density inside the jet cause a more severe cooling , resulting in a smaller @xmath169 then @xmath3 . according to the equations we used to estimate the black hole mass",
    ", we have the blr radius approximately with @xmath170 for @xmath171 broad lines .",
    "consequently , the energy density of blr photons @xmath172 is expected to be proportional to @xmath173 .",
    "we expect to see an anti - correlation between @xmath3 and the blr luminosity @xmath73 . however , we failed to find any correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath73 .",
    "several factors may erase the expected anti - correlation , e.g. the scatters in the derivation of blr luminosity from individual lines , the accuracy of empirical relation in estimating blr radius , and the inclusion of @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( vary from source to source ) in @xmath3 . as a result",
    ", the positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath174 can be partly ( if not all ) the result of the weak anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "[ nululinepeak.ps ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it indicates that fsrqs with higher ratio of disk to jet emission could have higher peak frequency .",
    "the fsrqs in our sample are defined from the flat spectrum between 1.4 and 4.85 ghz @xmath36 .",
    "however , this definition may influenced by several factors .",
    "it is well known that fsrqs usually show strong and rapid variability ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another factor is the different resolution at 1.4 and 4.85 ghz .",
    "first 1.4 ghz data are obtained from vla observations , which have much higher resolution than green bank telescope observations for 4.85 ghz data . in these respects , the simultaneous multi - band observations with same telescope configuration ( same resolution )",

    ", they do not reach the extreme value of bl lacs .",
    "no strong correlations are found either between the synchrotron peak frequency and black hole mass , or between the synchrotron peak frequency and the eddington ratio .",

    "<S> we constructed a sample of 185 flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) by cross - correlating the shen et al.s sdss dr3 x - ray quasar sample with first and gb6 radio catalogues . from the spectrum energy distribution ( sed ) </S>",
    "<S> constructed using multi - band ( radio , uv , optical , infrared and x - ray ) data , we derived the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole mass @xmath0 and the broad line region ( blr ) luminosity ( then the bolometric luminosity @xmath1 ) were obtained by measuring the line - width and strength of broad emission lines from sdss spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we define a subsample of 118 fsrqs , of which the nonthermal jet emission is thought to be dominated over the thermal emission from accretion disk and host galaxy . for this subsample </S>",
    "<S> , we found 25 fsrqs having synchrotron peak frequency @xmath2 hz , which is higher than the typical value for fsrqs . </S>",
    "<S> these sources with high @xmath3 could be the targets for the fermi gamma - ray telescope . </S>",
    "<S> only a weak anti - correlation is found between the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity , while no strong correlation is present either between the synchrotron peak frequency and black hole mass , or between the synchrotron peak frequency and the eddington ratio @xmath4 . when combining the fsrqs subsample with the wu et al.s sample of 170 bl lac objects , the strong anti - correlation between the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity apparently presents covering about seven order of magnitude in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the anti - correlation differs with the blazar sequence in the large scatter . at similar peak frequency </S>",
    "<S> , the peak luminosity of fsrqs with @xmath5 hz is systematically higher than that of bl lac objects , with some fsrqs out of the range covered by bl lac objects . </S>",
    "<S> although high @xmath3 are found in some fsrqs , they do not reach the extreme value of bl lacs . </S>",
    "<S> for the subsample of 118 fsrqs , we found significant correlations between the peak luminosity and black hole mass , the eddington ratio , and the blr luminosity , indicating that the jet physics may be tightly related with the accretion process .    </S>",
