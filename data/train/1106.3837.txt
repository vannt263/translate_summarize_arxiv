    "symmetries are one of the most important concepts in modern - day physics .",
    "they are the foundation of the standard model and are also frequently used as a basis for building new physical theories",
    ". even if a symmetry is only approximately fulfilled it can , nonetheless , serve as a starting point for a systematic description of physical observables , since the symmetry breaking effects may be accounted for perturbatively .",
    "this approach has been successfully employed in various effective field theories ( efts ) which are low - energy expansions in the ratio of a small parameter over a large parameter .",
    "the small parameter is frequently a small momentum and/or energy associated with explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "a prominent example of such an eft is the chiral eft , whose starting point is the chiral limit of qcd . in this limit , pions are the nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd . in the chiral eft the effect of the nonzero ( up , down , and strange ) quark masses is then systematically included order - by - order in the low - energy expansion .    while the use of symmetries to constrain theories is usually associated with particle physics , or possibly many - body physics , it has also become important in other fields , such as non - relativistic few - body physics .",
    "one example of an important symmetry in this area is discrete scale invariance .",
    "vitaly efimov showed in 1970 that the non - relativistic three - body system displays discrete scale invariance if the two - body scattering length is large and the range of the interaction is zero  @xcite .",
    "one well - known consequence is that in the limit of infinite scattering length the ratio of the binding energies of two successive three - body bound states is approximately 515 .",
    "efimov also pointed out that his results apply to systems where the two - body scattering length , @xmath2 , obeys @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the natural length - scale of the two - body potential  @xcite .",
    "they are therefore relevant for a number of systems .",
    "one example is nucleon - nucleon scattering , where the scattering length is large compared to the range of the internucleon interaction . a second",
    "is provided by manipulation of the atom - atom scattering length of trapped atoms by an external magnetic field such that the atomic scattering displays a feshbach resonance .",
    "few - body systems of nucleons and atoms , all with interactions tuned such that a shallow two - body bound state is present , will therefore display discrete scale invariance or the remainders of this symmetry .",
    "for a recent review of this topic see , e.g. , ref . @xcite .",
    "efimov s results have now been rederived as the leading - order ( lo ) prediction of an eft containing only short - range interactions  @xcite . at",
    "lo this eft corresponds to the efimovian , large-@xmath2 , @xmath5 limit .",
    "we therefore refer to it hereafter as short - range eft ( sreft ) .",
    "the contribution of each subsequent order in the sreft expansion is suppressed by an additional power of @xmath6 , with the first corrections that have to be included in this eft being those resulting from a finite two - body effective range , @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of these corrections have been analyzed over the last years in a number of works @xcite . in these studies",
    "effective - range corrections were considered for systems in which the scattering length remains fixed .",
    "a full analysis requires , however , that we allow for a variable scattering length .",
    "such an analysis was reported in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we lay out the derivation of the results reported in @xcite .",
    "we discuss the renormalization of the sreft in the three - body sector at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the @xmath6 expansion .",
    "we show that if , and only if , scattering - length - dependent observables are considered , an additional three - body counterterm is required for renormalization at next - to - leading order . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite overlooked this result since the combination of the non - perturbative treatment of effective - range corrections and the cutoffs @xmath7 employed there modifies the ultraviolet properties of the theory .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite therefore are strict eft predictions only in the limit @xmath8 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pionless - eft ] we will introduce sreft and briefly review what is known about the two - body sector up to next - to - leading order .",
    "we then discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : three - body - system ] , the so - called modified skorniakov - ter - martirosian integral equation which constitutes the application of the sreft to the three - body sector at leading order . section  [ sec : three - body - observ ] describes how nlo corrections affect a variety of three - body observables .",
    "section  [ sec : subl - three - body ] discusses the running of the nlo parts of the three - body force , and presents analytic results for these counterterms renormalization - group evolution .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : nlo - rel ] presents relations between observables measured in three - atom recombination which incorporate effects that are nlo in sreft .",
    "we end with a summary and outlook .",
    "we employ the sreft that describes non - relativistic particles interacting through a finite - range interaction with a large scattering length .",
    "the inverse of the range of the interaction sets the breakdown scale for this eft , which is constructed from contact interactions alone . in nuclear physics",
    "this eft is also known as the pionless eft ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "however , the sreft can also describe other systems such as atoms close to a feshbach resonance . since we perform our analysis for identical bosons we will refer to the interacting particles as atoms .    at the heart of any eft",
    "lies the lagrangian .",
    "it includes all possible interaction terms that are allowed by the symmetries of the underlying interaction and is built from fields that correspond to the degrees of freedom included in the eft .",
    "the sreft in its original form is therefore built from atom fields alone , however , it has proven useful to employ a lagrangian that contains a dimer field . the relation between these forms of the lagrangian",
    "is elucidated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works the dimer field is sometimes chosen to be static , sometimes dynamic .",
    "the latter version is particularly convenient for the inclusion of effective range corrections , and so we will work with this form of the sreft lagrangian , written as : @xmath9 where the ellipses represent additional higher - order interactions which are suppressed at low momenta . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a positive effective range can only be described by this theory if @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the free theory describes an atom and a ghost field .",
    "we will employ the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) and will expand all elements of all feynman graphs in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "the sreft lagrangian is then equivalent , order - by - order in the @xmath0 expansion , to the sreft lagrangian with an atom field alone , as presented in , e.g. , refs .",

    "the calculation of three - body observables requires the solution of an integral equation which we will call the modified skorniakov - ter - martirosian equation . it is the faddeev equation for non - relativistic particles interacting through two - body and three - body zero - range interactions .",
