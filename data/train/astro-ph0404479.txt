    "ss433 is a supercritically accreting microquasar with precessing accretion disk and collimated mildly relativistic ( @xmath3 ) jets ( see e.g. cherepashchuk et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) . since the discovery in 1978",
    ", this unique massive x - ray binary system has been investigated in optical , radio and x - rays by many authors ( e.g. cherepashchuk 1981 , margon 1984 , kawai et al .",
    "1989 , kotani et al .",
    "1996 , goranskii et al .",
    "1998a , b , marshall et al 2002 , fabrika 2004 ) .    ss433 is highly variable system and shows different types of periodicities :    \\1 .",
    "precessional variability ( @xmath4 ) which is observed by periodical doppler - shifts of h , he i , fe xxv and other x - ray emission lines in optical and x - ray spectra and is clearly visible in optical and x - ray light curves .    \\2 .",
    "orbital periodicity ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the shape of the orbital optical light curve strongly changes with precession phase ( goranskii et al .",
    "1998 a , b , cherepashchuk and yarikov 1991 ) .",
    "the value of the orbital period remains stable over more than 30 years , which can be considered as an argument against the common envelope model for ss433 .",
    "nutation periodicity ( @xmath6 ) which is observed as periodic deviations from purely precessional doppler motion of emission lines and can be recovered from photometric data ( goranskii et al .",
    "1988 a , b , cherepashchuk and yarikov 1991 ) .",
    "the period and phase of the nutational variability remain stable over at least 16 years ( around 950 nutation periods ) .",
    "nutation radial velocity variations are delayed from the nutation photometric variability by 0.6 days , which corresponds to the travel time from the accretion disk center to the formation region of optical moving emission lines downstream the relativistic jets located at @xmath7 cm away from the disk center .    the ao-1 _ integral _ observations of ss433 discovered hard ( up to 100 kev ) x - ray spectrum in this supercritically accreting microquasar ( cherepashchuk et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting the presence of an extended hot ( with temperature up to @xmath8 k ) region at the central parts of the accretion disk .",
    "these new data made it possible to compare the eclipse characteristics of ss433 at different energies : soft x - rays ( 2 - 10 kev , the _ asca _ data ) , soft and medium x - ray ( 1 - 35 kev , the _ ginga _ data ) , hard x - ray ( 20 - 70 kev , the _ integral _ data ) , and optical . such a comparison allows us to study the innermost structure of the supercritical accretion disk and to constrain the basic parameters of the binary system .",
    "this is especially important in view of recent controversial results on the optical spectroscopy of ss433 ( gies et al .",
    "2002 , charles et al .",
    "the coordinated multiwavelength observational campaign of ss433 was organized during the ao-1 _ integral _ observations of the ss433 field in march - june 2003 with the participation of the following research teams .",
    ". special astrophysical observatory of russian academy of science ( sao ras ) ( s. fabrika , e. barsukova ) . provided high signal - to - noise optical spectroscopy of ss433 at the 6-m telescope .",
    "crimean station of sternberg astronomical institute ( v. lyuty , t. irsmambetova ) .",
    "made bvr - photometry at the 0.6-m telescope .",
    "kazan state university .",
    "performed optical photometry at the russian - turkish 1.5-m telescope rtt-150 at the tubitak national observatory , turkey ( i. bikmaev , n. sakhibullin ) .",
    "infrared k - photometry was performed at 1.1-m azt-24 telescope of pulkovo observatory in italy , observatore di campo imperatore ( yu . gnedin , a. arkharov , v. larionov ) .",
    "radio monitoring at cm wavelength has been performed at the ratan-600 radio telescope of sao ras , indicating the source to be at its non - flaring state ( see trushkin 2003 for more detail ) .",
    "the results of a quick - look analysis of the _ integral _ observations of ss433 were published earlier ( cherepashchuk et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    "we present the results of more detailed study of the _ integral _ data together with the simultaneous optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of ss433 .",
    "more complete studies of all data on ss433 obtained during this campaign will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the _ integral _ ibis / isgri data were analyzed using publically available isdc software ( osa-3 version ) .",
    "the main results are as follows .    3.1 .",
    "the ibis / isgri spectrum of ss433 ( 25 - 100 kev ) obtained in may 2003 can be equally well fitted both by a power - law @xmath9 with photon index @xmath10 or optically thin thermal plasma emission with @xmath11 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ibis_sp ] ) .",
    "the source was not significantly detected by the jem - x telescope during these observations . however , we made use of too _ rxte _ observations of ss433 performed simultaneously with _",
    "integral _ in the end of march 2004 ( pi : m.revnivtsev ) to obtain the 2 - 100 kev spectrum of ss433 .",
    "the source was observed about one binary orbit ( @xmath12 days ) later than the disk maximum opening phase . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rxteibis_sp ] and is fitted by emission from optically thin thermal plasma with @xmath13 kev .    the integrated hard x - ray luminosity is @xmath14 erg / s , @xmath15 erg / s ( assuming the 5 kpc distance to ss433 ) , which is about 10% of the soft x - ray jet luminosity .",
    "no rapid variability was found in the hard x - ray band on characteristic timescales @xmath16 hour .",
    "the ibis / isgri count rates of ss433 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ibis_lc ] .",
    "the x - ray eclipse at hard energies is observed to be a little narrower than the optical one , slightly broader than in the 1 - 35 kev energy range and display extended wings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intandv ] ) .",
    "this is opposite to what is found in ordinary eclipsing x - ray binaries ( like cen x-3 , vela x-1 etc . ) , in which the x - ray eclipse duration decreases with energy .",
    "this new fact may reflect a complicated structure of the innermost supecritical accretion disk in ss433 .",
    "the eclipse depth is about 80% in hard x - rays compared to @xmath17 in 6 - 10 and 5 - 28 kev band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intandv ] ) .",
    "the 25 - 50 kev x - ray flux increases from @xmath18 to @xmath19 mcrab during precession period in marh - may 2003 .",
    "this modulation is 1.5 - 2 times larger than observed in 2 - 10 kev egergy band .",
    "thus , both precessional and eclipsing hard x - ray variabilities in ss433 exceed by 1.5 - 2 times those in the standard x - ray band .",
    "this suggests a more compact hard x - ray emitting region in the central parts of the accretion disk .",
    "the observed x - ray eclipse was interpreted by the model of a close binary with thick precessing accretion disk ( antokhina et al .",
    "the model includes the following basic elements : i ) dark optical star filling its roche lobe .",
    "ii ) dark thick precessing accretion disk with a central cone - like region ( the cone angle @xmath20 ) .",
    "iii ) bright extended bulge located at the central cone of the accretion disk .",
    "the observed x - ray eclipse in the 25 - 50 kev band is best fitted by this model for the mass ratio @xmath21 and the bright bulge size @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) is the binary semi - major axis ( fig . [",
    "fig : q_model ] ) .",
    "however , for reasons discussed below we shall assume @xmath24 as a fiducial value .",
    "photometry of ss433 was performed simultaneously with _ integral _ observations by the russian - turkish rtt-150 telescope of kazan university at the tubitak national observatory , turkey .",
    "observations were made by using commercial , thermoelectrically cooled to -60 c andor firm ccd ( model dw436 , www.andor-tech.com ) provided for rtt150 by mpa .",

    "near ir observations of ss433 were obtained at the azt-24 1.1 m telescope in campo imperatore ( italy ) with swircam during a period spanning july - august 2003 .",
    "swircam is the infrared camera that incorporates a 256x256 hgcdte nigmos 3-class ( picnic ) detector at the focus of azt-24 .",

    "the observations were done close to the cross - over precessional phase , where the orbital modulation appears to be significantly reduced .",
    "the optical spectroscopy of ss433 was carried out at the 6-m telescope of sao ras during 6 nights in april 28 and may 9 - 13 2003 , simultaneously with the _ integral _ observations , at the precessional phase corresponding to the maximum disk opening angle .",
    "the long - slit spectrograph and pm - ccd 1000x1000 detector were used to obtain 4100 - 5300 a spectra with a resolution of 3  a ( 1.2 a / pix ) . the blue part of the optical spectrum including he ii 4686 emission line was chosen for the analysis .",

    "the intensity of absorption lines during the eclipse allows us to estimate the effective temperature of the optical star to be @xmath31 k. the relative intensities of the strongest absorption lines indicate @xmath32 k , implying the optical spectral class of the companion a5-a7i .    the heating effect of the companion atmosphere is discovered by absorption lines . during the disk eclipse egress",
    ", low - excitation absorption lines strongly weaken .",
    "the stellar hemisphere illuminated by the bright accretion disk probably has a temperature of @xmath33 k , as the presence of cii 4267 absorption suggests .",
    "this is the only strong line in this region in hot stars .",
    "the cii 4267 absorption is deep out of the eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spklass ] ) and the line is only marginally detected inside the eclipse phases .",
    "evolution of the blend 4273 ( fei 4271.8 + feii 4273.3 + crii 4275.6 ) is seen : in the eclipse , low - excitation line fei is strongest , while out of eclipse feii+crii lines enhance .",

    "[ fig : rvindid ] we present individual absorption line radial velocities for four best - suited lines averaged over one night , as a function of the orbital phase for 6 nights .",
    "it is important to note that the strongest lines ( feii , hei , hydrogen ) are present in ss433 spectrum as emissions",
    ". some other strong lines ( among feii and hei lines ) appear in ss433 as pcyg - like absorption components or distorted absorptions , they are disfavored for the optical star radial velocity analysis , as they most probably form in the powerful outflowing disk wind ( fabrika et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the radial velocity curve measured by the most reliable collection of 22 absorption lines in the spectral range 4200 - 5300 a is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel ] . note that the absorption lines in ss433 spectrum are seen at our spectral resolution as blends containing 1 - 3 strong lines .",
    "relative intensities of the lines are probably change from date to date through the eclipse . in this reason we measured only those lines and in only those dates where the lines were detected the most convincingly . the radial velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radvel ] ) has been obtained by coadding of radial velocity curves of individual lines and a radial velocity of all lines for 11/05/03 ( the orbital phase 0.048 ) was adopted to be a zero .",
    "the derived radial velocity semi - amplitude of the optical star is @xmath34  km / s , the gamma - velocity of the binary system is @xmath35 km / s .",
    "the absorption line radial velocity transition through the @xmath36-velocity occurs at the middle of the optical eclipse ( @xmath37 ) , confirming that the lines actually belong to the optical star .",
    "these results confirm the earlier determination of @xmath38 by gies et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also made at the maximum disk opening angles ( note that spectroscopic observations by charles et al .",
    "2004 were performed at the cross - over phase of ss433 when the accretion disk is seen edge - on ; such a phase is disfavored for the optical star radial velocity analysis as strong gas outflows are present in the disk orbital plane ; selective absorption in this moving gas affects the true radial velocity of the optical star ) .",
    "the heating effect of the optical star also distorts the radial velocity semi - amplitude . the analysis ( wade and horne 1988 , antokhina et al .",
    "2004 ) indicates that true value of the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve as derived from these absorption lines can be reduced to @xmath39 km / s .",
    "comparison of radial velocities of the accretion disk ( @xmath40 km / s , fabrika and bychkova 1990 ) and optical star ( @xmath1 km / s ) yields the mass ratio in the ss433 system @xmath41 .",
    "this is an upper limit , as the true value of @xmath38 should be corrected for the heating effect .",
    "taken at face value , these @xmath42 lead to the optical star mass function @xmath43 and the binary component masses @xmath44 , @xmath45 . however , such a big mass ratio is in a strong disagreement with the observed duration of x - ray eclipse , which suggests much smaller mass ratio @xmath46 .",
    "we stress that the binary inclination angle in ss433 ( @xmath47 ) is fixed from the analysis of moving emission lines .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( 1 ) either the model we used to fit x - ray eclipses should be modified , or ( 2 ) the value of @xmath48 and @xmath38 are influenced by additional physical effects .",
    "though there are some reasons to modify the model ( e.g. , asymmetric shape of the x - ray eclipse , which may suggest an asymmetric wind outflow from the illuminated part of the optical star ) , we shall consider here only the second possibility .",
    "we repeat again that the actual value of @xmath38 should be decreased to account for the observed heating effect .",
    "let us assume the mass ratio in the system to be @xmath24 , as with this value we can satisfactorily describe the x - ray eclipse width ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : q_model ] ) . taking @xmath1 km",
    "/ s yields @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 km / s .",
    "clearly , this is an unacceptable model .",
    "now let us decrease @xmath38 down to 85 km / s , the lower limit which follows from more accurate treatment of the heating effect in the radial velocity curve analysis ( wade and horne 1988 , antokhina et al .",
    "this would yield a better fit with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 km / s , still too high to be acceptable .",
    "finally , let us take into account that less than half of the stellar surface is sufficiently cool to give the absorption lines under study ( e.g. due to sideway heating from x - ray jets and scattered uv radiation in the strong accretion disk wind ) .",
    "this additionally decrease the value of the actual radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "so taking , for example , @xmath56 km / s and @xmath24 yields the optical star mass function @xmath57 and binary masses @xmath58 , @xmath59 and optical star radius @xmath60 .",
    "this radius is compatible with typical bolometric luminosity of a @xmath61 a5-a7 supergiant with @xmath62  k. in this solution , @xmath63 km / s , larger than the measured value 175 km / s , but the true value of @xmath48 may be affected by the strong accretion disk wind .",
    "the _ integral _ and optical observations of ss433 provide support that ss433 is a massive black hole x - ray binary system .",
    "the presence of broad wings in the observed hard x - ray eclipse profile evidences for an extended central hot region in the ss433 accretion disk .",
    "this region is observed to be substantially eclipsed during precessional motion of the accretion disk . the detected broad - band ( 2 - 100 kev ) x - ray spectrum is best - fitteed by thermal plasma with @xmath64  kev .",
    "the origin of such an extended hot region in the cenral parts of supercritically accretion disk in ss433 needs more studies .",
    "the measured semi - amplitude of the radial velocity of the optical star is @xmath34 km / s , which confirms the results by gies et al .",
    "however , the actual semi - amplitude should be decreased down to @xmath65 km / s to be in agreement with the observed duration of x - ray and optical eclipses .",
    "this correction seems indeed inevitable because of strong heating effect present in the optical star of ss433 .    to measure more precisely the binary parameters of ss433 , further hard x - ray observations of ss433",
    "are required at different precession phases and high - resolution optical spectroscopy need to be carried out at the maximum disk open angle to accurately measure @xmath38 and @xmath48 .",
    "analysis of x - ray observations at minimum x - ray flux and the cross - over precession phase will allow more detailed reconstruction of x - ray emitting zone in the center of the supercritically accretion disk in ss433 .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on observations with _ integral _ , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , switzerland , spain ) , czech republic and poland , and with the participation of russia and the usa .",
