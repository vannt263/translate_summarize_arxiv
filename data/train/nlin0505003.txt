    "as it is understood in contemporary language , the theory of algebraic - geometric ( or finite - gap ) integration is a theory of integration of integrable nonlinear ( 1 + 1)-soliton partial differential equations ( pde s ) , finite - dimensional hamiltonian dynamical systems , and spectral problems defined by ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) .",
    "a large number of papers devoted to these problems , appeared over the last three decades , show that the vague term ` integration of integrable ' does not mean an automatical integrating procedure in some simple sense of the word .",
    "the contributions that are still being made to this theory testify to its vitality : all the evidence points to the continuance of its growth .",
    "although the term ` completely integrable ' is quite appropriate one , there is not commonly agreed answer to the questions about integrability and , in particular , to the question in the title of the present work .",
    "for example , in the theory of dynamical systems this means the well defined liouvillian integrability , but the search for separability variables ( followed by action - angle ones ) is a subject of an independent theory ( flaschka & mclaughlin 1976 ; vanhaecke 1996 ) . in the case of ( 1 + 1)-integrable pde s ,",
    "the theory is , in fact , a treatment of these equations as infinite - dimensional analogues of hamiltonian systems ( zakharov & faddeev 1971 ; gardner 1971 ) plus set of nontrivial exact solutions in terms of elementary functions : solitons , positons , and their relatives ( ablowitz & segur 1981 ) .",
    "there are natural multidimensional generalizations of the theory ( the kadomtsev ",
    "petviashvili ( kp ) , davey  stewartson equations , their hierarchies , etc . )",
    "which are rather well developed also .",
    "integrability of spectral problems ( direct and inverse ) is usually associated with the inverse scattering method , soliton theory ( ablowitz & segur 1981 ; novikov 1984 ; levitan 1987 ) and its @xmath0-generalizations ( dubrovin 1975 ; matveev 1976 ; mckean & van moerbeke 1975 ; flaschka 1975 ; novikov 1984 ; belokolos _",
    "et all _ 1994 ; gesztesy & holden 2003 ) .",
    "we must include here the deep links of this field to diverse areas of mathematics shedding light on the mechanism of integrability : hirota s @xmath2-function method , painlev analysis ( conte 1999 ) , abelian varieties ( dubrovin 1976 ; vanhaecke 1996 ) , darboux  bcklund algebraic transformations ( matveev & salle 1991 ) , differential geometry ( darboux 1915 ) , theory of commuting differential operators ( krichever 1978 ) etc .",
    "each of these links is sufficient in itself to provide a complete development ; combined , they exhibit an unusual wealth of ideas and furnish rich resources of new interrelations .",
    "nevertheless , there is a common object for all the approaches mentioned above : a @xmath0-representation for a wide class of solutions and fundamental @xmath1-function as a solution to associated linear spectral problem .",
    "the key role of this object was discovered by its & matveev ( 1975 ) in the example of the kdv - equation .",
    "the next years after , krichever ( 1976 , 1977a ) put such a construction into a basis of integration of soliton equations and it became clear that this link between kdv  equation and the schrdinger operator @xmath3 is not an exception but a common feature .",
    "the ideology is spread to the whole class of such problems .",
    "presently this is known as a concept of the baker  akhiezer function ( krichever 1978 ) and such an approach generates all the ( 1 + 1)-soliton equations and their hierarchies if an algebraic curve has been specified .",
    "originally the term ` finite - gap ' meant spectral problem for the smooth real periodic potential with finitely many lacunae at spectrum of schrdinger s operator .",
    "later , in the 1970 s , in works by matveev , its , dubrovin , krichever , and others that treatment was generalized to quasi - periodic complex valued potentials and related to methods of algebraic geometry and @xmath0-functions ( matveev 1976 ; dubrovin _ et all _ 1976 ; krichever 1977b ) . by this reason throughout the paper",
    "we keep traditional terminology ` finite - gap ' but identify it with ` algebraic - geometric ' .",
    "it is difficult to keep pace with the continuing growth of the literature which is due to the activity of mathematicians . to become acquainted with the background of this field , as well as",
    "find a complete set of references , it is perhaps best to consult the surveys written by initiators of the theory .",
    "until the pioneer work by novikov ( 1974 ) the schrdinger equation was mostly an object of the spectral theory of operators ( akhiezer 1961 ; levitan & sargsjan 1975 ) . by that time",
    "few solvable ( in different senses ) examples were known .    1 .   the constant potential ( trivial case ) ; 2 .   quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath4 ; 3 .   linear potential @xmath5 ; 4 .",
    "decaying potentials @xmath6 and their rational degenerations ; 5 .",
    "reflectionless potentials of bargmann ( solitons ) characterized by the property @xmath7 with a polynomial in @xmath8 function @xmath9 ( see also darboux ( 1915 : p.212 ) ) ; 6 .",
    "the time isospectral deformations of these reflectionless potentials being governed by kdv - dynamics ( ablowitz & segur 1981 ) ; 7 .",
    "lam s potentials @xmath10 ( see whittaker & watson ( 1927 ) ) ; 8 .",
    "generalizations of the lame potentials ( darboux 1882 , 1915 : p.228 ) @xmath11 being called now the treibich  verdier potentials . the following year after darboux ,",
    "two comprehensive mmoires by sparre ( 1883 ) appeared on further generalizations .    a considerable result of matveev and its is that they all , apart from the cases 23 , lie within the framework of unified theory and are specifications or degenerations of a wider class , the class of algebraic - geometric potentials expressible by the following nice formula ( its & matveev 1975a , b ; matveev 1976 ) @xmath12 the same authors ( see also novikov 1974 ; dubrovin 1975 ; lax 1975 ) proved that all these potentials are solutions of higher stationary ode s which are presently named novikov s equations . an important observation of novikov ( 1974 ) was that these equations are representable as hamiltonian finite - dimensional dynamical systems in @xmath13 .",
    "soon this property was completely clarified by gelfand & dikii ( 1975 , 1979 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian treatment of novikov s equations closely joined the examples mentioned above with the well - known liouville s integrability .",
    "moreover , liouville s integrability of these equations has received a natural completion .",
    "namely , all the solutions are given by the famous trace formula ( matveev 1976 ) @xmath14 notice that presence of liouville s attributes itself does not automatically provide a procedure of the integration ( this is a theorem of existence ) but the trace formula supplemented with the jacobi inversion problem brings about such a procedure . in the language of dynamical systems this means , in fact , transformation to separability variables .",
    "what could one say about solution @xmath1 corresponding to the potentials mentioned above ?",
    "the answers are well - known .",
    "elementary functions in the cases 1 and 46 , airy s special functions in the case 3 , the hermit polynomials ( up to an exponential factor ) for the case 2 under @xmath15 with integral @xmath16 , weber s ( or parabolic s cylinder ) special functions for this case under arbitrary @xmath8 , and elliptic and related to them functions for the cases 78 .",
    "for example , in the case 7 with @xmath17 we have @xmath18 the @xmath0-representation of the @xmath1-function corresponding to the potentials , in traditional notations and terminology , is given by the formula of a.its : @xmath19    on the other hand , the elementary solutions to the @xmath1 are representable by elementary functions , i.e. exactly solvable in terms of elementary indefinite integrals .",
    "the elliptic cases 78 and are not exceptions : they are representable by indefinite elliptic integrals .",
    "a natural question arises : what about and ?",
    "the answer is that these are not exception as well .",
    "indefinite quadratures is a common property of the spectral problem under consideration .",
    "this means that the known liouville s integrability of nonlinear novikov s equations , in fact , turns out to be equivalent to the quadrature integrability of the ` linear ' @xmath1 and conversely . in turn ,",
    "the well - known effective solvability of direct / inverse spectral problems in the class of analytic nonsingular decaying soliton potentials ( ablowitz & segur 1981 ) turns out to be nothing else but explicit solvability by _ elementary _ tools , i.e. indefinite integrations and their inversions .",
    "moreover , such an opportunity is only one .",
    "the next sections contain proof of the statements above and we suggest that this is a common feature of all spectral problems arising in the soliton theory .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the representation ( after crossing out @xmath8 and adding the kp - variables @xmath20 ) as a function of a point @xmath21 on arbitrary algebraic curve is a natural and fundamental object for kp - hierarchies of ( 2 + 1)-pde s ( krichever 1977 ) .",
    "we shall restrict our consideration only to spectral problems defined by ode s as independent objects , so that their integrability , in the above sense , belongs to their intrinsic nature .",
    "moreover , we will restrict ourselves only to the schrdinger equation that we view merely as a differential equation with a parameter ( subject to explicit integration ) rather than a spectral problem with any boundary conditions , commuting operator , etc .",
    "perhaps the most surprising facet is the fact that the ideology mentioned above has not received mention in the modern literature in the context .",
    "it belongs to j.drach ( 1919 ) and his name was revealed by d. & g.chudnovsky ( 1984 ) and v.matveev ( belokolos _ et all _ 1994 : pp.8485 ) , who drew attention his remarkable results .",
    "the first sentences in ( drach 1919 ) clearly indicate his motivations is an _ arbitrary parameter_. the most interesting among them are those where the riccati equation @xmath22 ( and consequently the equation @xmath23\\,y$ ] as well ) can be integrated by _ quadratures _ ; we will show how one determines the function @xmath24 in all these cases . ] .",
    "the class of finite - gap @xmath25algebraic - geometric@xmath26 potentials is the only one when the spectral problem @xmath27 is integrable for the @xmath1 by quadratures under all values of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the solution has the form @xmath28 wherein the function @xmath29 is a polynomial in @xmath8 solution of the equation @xmath30    drach himself does not give a proof therefore to produce one , including step - by - step mechanism of integration , is not without interest .",
    "the proof will call to mind the classical result of its & matveev ( 1975 ) about criteria of the potential to be finite - gap",
    ". however we do not invoke any attributes of spectral theories : reality of the potential , periodicity , weyl s bases , monodromies , squares of eigenfunctions @xmath31 , spectrums , resolvent , functional spaces , etc .",
    "actually we will be writing known and somewhat new formulas of the theory but keeping in mind only ideology of drach . before passing to the proof of the theorem",
    "we will formulate a known statement which occurs in the literature in numerous contexts ( ermakov 1880 ; marchenko 1974 ; its & matveev 1975 ; gelfand & dikii 1975 ; alber 1979 ) .",
    "integrability of the equation is equivalent to integrability of the third order linear differential equation @xmath32 or compact nonlinear equation of ermakov for quasi - amplitude @xmath33 of the @xmath1@xmath34 @xmath35    though this proposition is a straight consequence of the equations ( [ psi]2 ) , we will give a _ derivation _ all the formulas ( [ psi]4 ) .",
    "arguments are as follows .    one sufficient test of quadrature integrability a given ode is furnished by a solvable lie point symmetry of the equation .",
    "this technique ( group analysis of differential equations ) is rather well developed ( ibragimov 1985 ; eisenhart 1933 ) so that applying this simple computations to the schrdinger equation we get necessary attributes of the theory in a natural way . indeed , generator @xmath36 of the point symmetries @xmath37 for the equation has the following form : @xmath38 wherein @xmath39 are arbitrary solutions of and @xmath40 satisfies the equation .",
    "the functions @xmath41 do not help in further integrating ( need to know solution @xmath1 itself ) and we set them equal to zero .",
    "the remaining free constant in says that the symmetry does not disappear and we have a solvable commutative 2-parametric symmetry @xmath42 .",
    "transformation to ` integrable ' variables @xmath43 is provided by the standard lie symmetry machinery .",
    "we get an explicit change ( eisenhart 1933 : p.91 , case @xmath44 ) @xmath45 in new variables , as lie s theory guarantees , the equation will be easily solvable . making use of one - fold integrated form of the equation ,",
    "i.e. the equations or , an equation for the function @xmath46 becomes @xmath47 , where the constant of ermakov ",
    "drach @xmath48 is a constant of integration .",
    "the equation is readily solved indeed and , after back transformations , we arrive at the formula .",
    "point of departure of ermakov ( 1880 ) was the same ",
    "integrability by quadratures .",
    "_ necessity_. the function @xmath1 followed by the @xmath29 is a function of two variables @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "our aim is to find out the dependence of these functions upon both the variables .",
    "they are analytical entire functions of the parameter @xmath8 ( yakubovich & starzhinskii 1975 ) .",
    "this allows one to represent @xmath29 in a form of analytical series @xmath49 the equation is linear hence there exists a recurrence relation on the coefficients @xmath50 derivable from the equation @xmath51    the next step is to make use of ermakov ",
    "drach s equation wherein the constant @xmath48 is , at the moment , _ arbitrary and independent of _ @xmath8 .",
    "we must require integrability under _ all _ values @xmath8 .",
    "this means that after substitution the series into , coefficients in front of @xmath52 must be zeroes , independently of each other : @xmath53 hence , the coefficients @xmath54 are determined by subsequent integration this infinite system of chained equations .",
    "it is clear that quadrature integrability takes place not for arbitrary functions @xmath55 .",
    "by which restrictions are such functions distinguished from all possible ones ?    rewrite the series as a power series in @xmath56 ( gelfand & dikii 1975 ) : @xmath57 whereupon the recurrence relation acquires the well - known computable form : @xmath58 thus , for arbitrary @xmath55 the @xmath1 is expressed by the formula with the differential polynomial @xmath59$}};\\lambda)$ ] of infinite order .",
    "moreover , making use of this recurrence with subsequent collection in @xmath60 , the equation turns into @xmath61 the dependence on @xmath62 has gone at infinity : the first half ( it is infinite ! ) contains only constants @xmath63 and the second one does differential polynomials of infinite order in @xmath62 . in order to get conditions of finite order in derivatives",
    "@xmath64 we have the only possibility  to set @xmath29 to be a finite polynomial : @xmath65$}};\\lambda)=\\lambda^g+r_{g-1}\\lambda^{g-1}+\\cdots+r_1 \\lambda+r_0.\\ ] ] accordingly , splitted restrictions on the potential become @xmath66 , now not necessary zero , constants @xmath67 plus @xmath68 differential conditions of finite order @xmath69 their compatibility means that such a class of potentials is not empty and the parameter _",
    "@xmath48 must depend on the spectral one_. this corresponds to a choice the particular solution @xmath29 among three linear independent @xmath70 defined by integration constants @xmath71 such that the constant @xmath72 is algebraically related with @xmath8 : @xmath73 .",
    "these potentials admits such a dependence and the condition , or which is the same , turns into a hyperelliptic algebraic curve of finite genus @xmath74    the set of equations is 1-fold integrated novikov s equations ( stationary kdv - equations ) and a half of their integrals @xmath75$}};c)$ ] .",
    "thus quadrature integrability of the @xmath1 has became equivalent to integrability of these equations .",
    "if it has been established , a final answer is given by substitution @xmath55 into the polynomial and then into the formula .",
    "we emphasize that the well - known formula _ does not mean any integrability _ without formula for @xmath76 .",
    "this is ansatz and such a form of solution to the ode does exist for arbitrary @xmath76 .",
    "_ sufficiency_. the sufficiency is a procedure of explicit integration of the equations .",
    "it is widely known and we do not repeat details here ( drach 1919 ; dubrovin 1975 ) .",
    "the answer is the formula plus integral representation for the functions @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless we note that being a remarkable _ identity _ in the spectral theories ( levitan 1987 ) , the trace formula turns into a necessary and key object in the quadrature methodology .",
    "@xmath78      rather than mere identities , we consider consequences of the well - known definition of the polynomial @xmath29 and new variables @xmath79 , for example @xmath80 , as algebraic transformations from the variables @xmath81 to the separability variables @xmath82 .",

    "missing ones and therefore the second half is extracted by involving the drach ",
    "dubrovin differential equations : @xmath87 where constants @xmath88 are functions of novikov s constants @xmath89 and the integrals .",
    "we thus get the remaining part of the complete change : @xmath90 the equations are readily rewritten into a promised integral form which coincides the jacobi inversion problem for the hyperelliptic algebraic curve @xmath91 with this equation we can obtain formula for the @xmath1-function which is not seem to be in the literature : @xmath92 the variables of integration lie on the curve @xmath93 .    it may be remarked at once that complete set of the transformations above to the separability variables @xmath82 is not necessary for novikov s equations themselves .",
    "this is an attribute of their hamiltonian description ( gelfand & dikii 1979 ) derivable from the main trace formula and the equations .",
    "it thus appears that the formula or supplemented with the two objects and ( 4.910 ) explains the nature of integrability in question .",
    "subsequent procedure of inversion for a symmetrical sum of @xmath94 s is necessary for ultimate representation to the solution . in the degenerated cases ( constant potential , solitons and the like ) all the integrals reduce to integrals of rational functions , so that the problem becomes trivial ( inversion of logarithms ) and leads to well - known exponents . in general case , this transcendental problem is solved with the help of riemann s @xmath0-functions ( see  7 ) .",
    "we would like to note that even ` naive ' ( not finite - gap ) procedure of integration of the trivial potential @xmath95 completely accords with the scheme described above .",
    "holomorphic integrals do not appear but , instead , the following objects arise : integral definition of the logarithm , i.e. integration of a trivial rational function , and necessity of inversion of the former ( the exponent ) .",
    "quadrature integrability does not depend on a choice of dependent / independent variables .",
    "we could formally avoid the inversion of abelian integrals rewriting the theory in the ` inverse ' variable @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , after the change @xmath96 @xmath97 we arrive at a second order linear ode ( @xmath98 is the standard schwarzian ) @xmath99 which can be of interest in its own right as a new spectral problem ( operator @xmath8-pencil ) for some ` good ' functions @xmath100 .",
    "the former depends on a chosen potential @xmath101 .",
    "apparently the second equation in , written in the form @xmath102 and equation play an important part in the theory , if only because inversion of arbitrary finite - gap potential satisfies this integrable 2-nd order nonlinear ode with suitable function @xmath103 .",
    "let us consider some examples @xmath104 .    * soliton potentials @xmath105 : @xmath106 * the lam potentials @xmath107 ( whittaker & watson 1927 ) : @xmath108 * arbitrary even elliptic finite - gap potential @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a rational function of @xmath111 .",
    "a wide family of such potentials there provides the theory of elliptic solitons ( acta appl . math .",
    "the function @xmath103 is as follows @xmath112 where @xmath113 is another rational function of @xmath111 .",
    "hence @xmath114 is a genus zero algebraic function of @xmath62 or rational function of @xmath111 : @xmath115 ; * arbitrary elliptic soliton @xmath55 .",
    "the equation takes the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes a differential equation connecting the elliptic function @xmath62 and its derivative @xmath118 ( algebraic equation of genus unity ) .    by the previous constructions , all these equations and their relatives of the type",
    "are of fuchsian class and integrable by quadratures .",
    "we thus get a solution for all elliptic solitons generalizing formulas of hermite ( belokolos _ et all _ 1994 : p.82 ) : @xmath119 wherein , owing to , @xmath120$}};\\lambda)$ ] becomes rational function in @xmath121 .",
    "the last step is a standard problem to representation the elliptic abelian integral , which is solved in terms of jacobian @xmath122-functions .",
    "it should be remarked that the presence of explicit @xmath1 leads to explicit factorization all of the linear operators , and with arbitrary @xmath8 s .",
    "for example : @xmath123 where roots @xmath124 have the quadrature form @xmath125 the @xmath0-functional representation for this and other factorizations is readily written down using formulas of  7 .      to all appearances",
    "liouville was the first ( 183341 ) to recognize a significance of the object @xmath126 and associated linear ode of higher order in the context of integration of linear ode s in closed form ( liouville 1839 ) .",
    "the third order equation explicitly arose and was discussed on pp .",
    "430431 in ( liouville 1839 ) .",
    "though liouville was doing in the spirit of algebraic solvability , a presence of a parameter in equations turns the theory into the spectral one .",

    "this corresponds exactly to the ` polynomial in @xmath62 ' cases of liouville ( 1839 ) for the equation .",
    "v. kuznetsov ( 2001 , personal communication ) pointed out a relationship of the theory with an algorithm of kovacic ( 1986 ) and , as we have seen now , this key observation leads to the natural conclusion :    * [ thesis ] _ liouvillian integrability of linear ode s _",

    "the next section contains an additional information , examples , and connections with non - integrable equations .",

    "well - known transformations between them have a quadrature characterization .",
    "the @xmath103-functions corresponding to integrable riccati s equations can be rational / algebraic , elementary , or transcendental .",
    "it is rather evident that non - integrable equations contain integrable subcases .",
    "say , the quantum harmonic oscillator @xmath129 shows that this potential , seemingly having nothing in common with the finite - gap ones , is integrable by quadratures if @xmath48 is an integer .",

    "whether exists transformation between nonfinite - gap equation ( with a parameter or no ) @xmath130 and a finite - gap one ?",
    "such a transformation depends on chosen equations and can be rather complicated .",
    "in contrast to the preceding ( [ 5.0]2 ) , corresponding functional relation is given by the general change of variables @xmath131 @xmath132 and depends on the potential @xmath133 .",
    "arbitrary equation and the finite - gap one @xmath27 are transformable into each other by the following functional relation @xmath134 where functions @xmath135 are independent solutions of @xmath27 and .    from ( 1.1 )",

    "we get the formula and complete the proof .",
    "it thus appears that the product solution @xmath126 is a fundamental object in the finite - gap theory and the ratio is fundamental in transformations between riccati s equations .",
    "such arguments might seem to be trivial because every integrable equation is transformable to the trivial @xmath140 .",
    "but an example of rawson ( 1883 ) shows nontrivial consequences : generating of finite - gap spectral problem with @xmath141 from the oldest and classical equation of riccati  bernoulli with a parameter .",
    "the paper of rawson is so short that we completely reproduced it in the appendix a without any comments with appearance @xmath142 .",
    "another example of ` triviality ' is the class of potentials in elementary functions ( solitons and the like ) generated from the zero potential by the darboux transformation ( matveev & salle 1991 ) . ] .",

    "we do not develop this topic here .",
    "it would appear reasonable that the widely known and universal @xmath0-description of the theory ( krichever 1977a , b ) should be obtainable from the spectral problem itself .",
    "this is so indeed .",
    "here we will obtain the @xmath0-representation for the @xmath1-function and , thereby , its properties as a function of baker ",

    ", pure spectral approaches were extended to the complex valued potentials .",
    "( see recent monograph by gesztesy & holden ( 2003 ) for most exhaustive bibliography and new results in spectral treatment of the theory )",
    ". taking this into account we will refer a general @xmath8-dependence of the @xmath1 as its spectral property and its dependence upon @xmath13-variable is considered to be parametric .",
    "such a spectral view arose in the paper by akhiezer ( 1961 ) and was completed in full by its & matveev ( 1975 : ",
    "it seems helpful to compare this classical approach with a ` reverse ' one , i.e. primary @xmath13-dependence of the @xmath1 .",
    "this would correspond to pure quadrature arguments with a parametrical @xmath8-dependence made out in the previous sections .",
    "the @xmath0-functional representation to the @xmath1-function is a consequence of the quadrature representations and .    since the spectral parameter @xmath8 is connected with the variable @xmath48 by the algebraic equation of finite genus @xmath66 we view both these variables as meromorphic functions @xmath161 of a global parameter @xmath2 on the curve .",
    "accordingly , we consider the @xmath1-function as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath2 @xmath162 where @xmath163 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it is a symmetrical function of the quantities @xmath164 and the formers , as functions of @xmath13 , are defined from the inversion problem : @xmath165 let @xmath166 be a matrix of @xmath167-periods of the holomorphic abelian integrals : @xmath168 all the terminology and notation in this section is standard and elucidated in any paper on the finite - gap integration . as usual , we normalize the integrals @xmath169 , introducing the canonical base of normal holomorphic abelian integrals @xmath170 : @xmath171 jacobi s inversion problem , acquires the form @xmath172 where we adopt the concise baker s notation ( baker 1897 ) for abelian integrals : @xmath173 the vector @xmath174 depends on the curve @xmath175 but @xmath163 and @xmath176 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the function depends on the point @xmath2 on the curve @xmath175 and on the variable @xmath13 through @xmath94 s .",
    "thus it is a single - valued function ( but not abelian ) of a point @xmath177 on the jacobian @xmath178 and , hence , has a @xmath0-functional representation .",
    "indeed , the arisen sum is nothing else but the fundamental @xmath179-function of weierstrass  ( 1856 ) and clebsch  gordan ( clebsch & gordan 1866 ) @xmath180 where @xmath181 denotes the elementary normal abelian differential of 3-rd kind with 1-st order poles at the points @xmath182 and residues @xmath183 respectively .",
    "clebsch and gordan ( 1866 ) devoted chs.68 in their book to detail properties of this object and regular procedure of derivation the @xmath0-representation for it ( see also baker 1897 ) .",
    "we have from there ( clebsch & gordan 1866 :   54 , 57 ; baker 1897 :   171 , 187188 ) @xmath184\\right.,\\ ] ] where vector @xmath185 is a zero of the @xmath0-function .",
    "in our situation we have @xmath186 .",
    "the representations for zeroes @xmath187 and the riemann constants @xmath188 are not unique because they depend on a lower bound of the holomorphic integrals @xmath170 . on the other hand the point @xmath189 on",
    "the jacobian contains free constants @xmath176 in , so that we may simplify the considerations putting @xmath190 s equal to @xmath191 s apart from @xmath79 and set @xmath192 with arbitrary points @xmath193 , say @xmath94 s .",
    "we thus arrived at riemann s function @xmath194 . as a consequence of these arguments and explicit zeroes of the @xmath1 in we get the following formula ( see also baker ( 1928 ) : pp.588589 ) @xmath195 the integrals in are elementary but not normal .",
    "hence we have an identity @xmath196 with some normalizing constants @xmath197 .",
    "taking into account jacobi s problem we arrive at the intermediate answer @xmath198    meromorphic part of the @xmath1-function has been determined . in order to determine the function @xmath199 in we involve the transformation properties of the @xmath1 as the function on the curve @xmath175 .",
    "let @xmath200 and @xmath201 denote linear - fractional transformations of the variable @xmath2 corresponding to the cycles @xmath202 and @xmath203 . from the primary representation we conclude that @xmath204 saves its own form , up to a multiplier @xmath205 , when @xmath2 undergoes the transformations @xmath206 .",
    "hence the formula must hold this property .",
    "clearly , the function @xmath207 is an entire function of @xmath13 since @xmath208 s are everywhere finite .",
    "further , the @xmath209-transformations of the @xmath0 s in say that the function @xmath210 has to be a linear function in @xmath13 to compensate an exponential multiplier @xmath211 in : @xmath212 invariance of the @xmath0-functions in with respect to @xmath213-transformations implies @xmath214 the transformations @xmath215 imply @xmath216 let @xmath2 approaches the pole @xmath217 of the meromorphic function @xmath218 .",
    "such a pole is only one and , designating @xmath219 , we have @xmath220 from these formulas and we obtain ( extracting terms independent of @xmath94 s ) @xmath221 and therefore we get one more property @xmath222    a function with the properties 13 ) does exist on @xmath175 .",
    "this is the normal elementary abelian integral of the second kind @xmath223 with the first order pole at the point @xmath217 .",
    "its principal part and a constant in are well defined so that this function is completely determined and unique . in turn , the three parameters @xmath224 may be freely chosen , say , @xmath225 respectively . the vector @xmath174 in ( [ canonical]5 )",
    "becomes the vector of @xmath226-periods of the integral @xmath227 .",
    "summarizing the arguments above and recovering a normalizing constant @xmath228 we get the spectral properties of the @xmath1 and complete the proof .    from the last expansion of the @xmath229 we obtain the formula .",
    "indeed , @xmath230 hence , by virtue of the property @xmath231 , the derivative @xmath232 may be replaced by @xmath233 and we get the final formula @xmath234    we should conclude here that the spectral and quadrature considerations are mutually replaceable . the explicit transition between these approaches there provides the known weierstrass s theorem on a permutation of arguments and parameters in the normal abelian integrals of 3-rd kind @xmath235 this fact immediately leads to the equivalence of the ` spectral ' formula for the @xmath1 ( its & matveev 1975 : formulas ( 4.1213 ) ) and the quadrature one or .",
    "the above mentioned theorem , in our notation , has the form @xmath236 where @xmath237 .",
    "since the @xmath1 contains all the information , we can obtain suitable expressions for all objects of the theory .",
    "in particular , @xmath0-functional representation for ` finite - gap function ' of ermakov having numerous applications . renormalizing it by the formula @xmath238 we obtain @xmath239 ` finite - gap ' means that the constant @xmath48 in ermakov s equation is not independent of @xmath8 : @xmath73 .",
    "note that the equation itself exemplifies the integrable and factorizable linear operator pencil with abelian coefficients ( like soliton spectral problems ) but its solution , as a counterexample , is not a function of baker  akhiezer .",
    "many of constructions in ",
    " 3 , 57 can be carried over to arbitrary spectral problems although not so simply as in the case of the schrdinger / kdv equation .",
    "nontrivial examples of the @xmath1 were obtained in ( ustinov 2002 ) and modifications of dubrovin s equations and trace formulas in ( brezhnev 2002 ) .",
    "apparently baker ( 1928 : p.587 ) was the first to realize the exponential property of the fundamental @xmath179-function in disguise , however explicit meromorphic integrals like @xmath227 are , to all appearances , the result of the modern theory and became a universal property of all the integrable models ( krichever 1970 s ) .",
    "note , that throughout the paper we made no restrictions on the curve . it may be singular and the theory can be rewritten ( with minor changes in  7 ) because the degenerated holomorphic integrals @xmath240 , in this case , turn into the integrals @xmath241 of the 3-rd kind .",
    "clebsch & gordan ( 1866 :  43 ) call the corresponding problem ` extended inversion problem ' which is solved by theta as well",
    ". such cases of degenerations were considered also by baker ( 1897 ) and even by abel ( see his uvres 1881 , * i * : p.170  ) .",
    "it is to be noticed , that contrary to commonly accepted ( ? ) viewpoint , the general @xmath0-series , as well as its argument @xmath242 , ought to be considered not as a special function or formal generalization of jacobi s @xmath122-function but _ regularly _ derivable fundamental object for explicit representation of all abelian integrals , meromorphic / uniformizing functions , exponential baker ",
