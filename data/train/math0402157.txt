    "in @xcite remarkable dimension formulas for the exceptional series of complex simple lie algebras were established , parametrizing the series by the dual coexeter number in @xcite and using the dimensions of composition algebras in @xcite .",
    "cohen and deman observed that all parameter values giving rise to integer outputs in all the formulas of @xcite were already accounted for with essentially one exception , which , were it the dimension of a composition algebra , would be of dimension six and sit between the quaternions and octonions to produce a lie algebra sitting between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    ", we discuss intermediate lie algebras in general and their homogeneous varieties , in particular the exceptional lie algebra @xmath3 defined by the triality construction of @xcite applied to the sextonions . this lie algebra is intermediate between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "of course it is not simple but remarkably , shares most of the properties of the simple exceptional lie algebras discovered by vogel and deligne .",
    "more generally , many of the dimension fomulas of @xcite are satisfied by the intermediate lie algebras and some of the decomposition formulas of @xcite hold as well .",

    "@xmath12    intermediate lie algebras ( sometimes in the forms @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) have appeared in @xcite .",
    "shtepin used them to help decompose @xmath4-modules as @xmath16-modules in a multiplicity free way to make gelfand - tsetlin bases .",
    "gelfand and zelevinsky used them to make representation models for the classical groups ( and we hope the varieties discussed here might lead to similar models for the exceptional groups , or even that the triality model will give rise to uniform representation models for all simple lie groups ) .",
    "proctor made a detailed study of certain representations of the _ odd symplectic lie algebras _ and proved a weyl dimension formula for these .",
    "in  2 we define and discuss the _ adjoint varieties _ of the intermediate lie algebras . in ",
    "3 we give geometric interpretations of the adjoint variety of the exceptional group @xmath2 , in particular we show that it parametrizes sextonionic subalgebras of the octonions .",
    "we also give a new description of the variety of quaternionic subalgebras of the octonions . in ",
    "4 we review the triality construction of freudenthal s magic square and show how it applies to the sextonions . in  5 , we discuss highest weight modules of intermediate lie algebras , showing how to decompose the cartan powers of the adjoint representation as an @xmath16 module .",
    "we also remark that some of vogel s universal decomposition fomulas hold . in  6 we show that some of the more refined decomposition fomulas of @xcite hold for the rows of the extended magic square .",
    "corresponding dimension formulas are stated and proven in  7 . finally in  [ geomsect ] we describe the geometry of closures of the orbits of highest weight vectors @xmath17 inside the preferred representations described in  [ rowbyrowsect ] .",
    "in particular we get a new ( slightly singular ) severi variety that we study in detail",
