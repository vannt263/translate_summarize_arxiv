    "however , as originally discovered by cobe , the measured value of the quadrupole seems low compared to the model prediction .",
    "originally it was estimated that the probability of measuring such a low or lower quadrupole was 0.7% assuming that the @xmath0cdm model was correct @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent studies with more detailed methods of dealing with foregrounds have estimated this probability to be closer to 4% @xcite .",
    "the alignment of the quadrupole and octopole @xcite and various asymmetries in the data @xcite have also being considered .",
    "this probability of such a low or lower quadrupole would not be particularly anomalous if the quadrupole were treated on par with all other multipoles .",
    "such points would be expected to occur just by chance in such a large data set .",
    "in fact there are several other equally or more anomalous multipoles .",
    "however the quadrupole is particularly intriguing in that it represents the largest observable angular scale and so may be a good probe of new physical effects .",
    "in particular , it is the multipole whose power has the most significant contribution from length scales that are on and even above the horizon at dark energy domination .",

    "we focus on the latter class and in particular a generalization of the correlated isocurvature model introduced by @xcite .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : transfer ] with a general discussion of the origin of the temperature quadrupole in the adiabatic model and explore its relationship to the low multipole polarization . in  [ sec : isocurvaturemodel ] , we show how the properties of the adiabatic quadrupole point to a specific class of isocurvature models that can cancel the sachs - wolfe contributions to the quadrupole .",

    "we discuss an inflationary context for such perturbations in  [ sec : inflation ] but show that in the simplest models gravitational waves are over - predicted .",
    "we also include a pedagogical appendix on dark energy perturbations in a quintessence and k - essence context .",
    "in an adiabatic model with dark energy , the cmb temperature quadrupole receives its contributions from two distinct effects : the ( ordinary ) sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect from temperature and metric fluctuations near recombination and the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect from changes in the metric fluctuations due to the dark energy .",

    "however the distance to @xmath39 is much smaller than @xmath40 and that degrades the efficiency with which the isw effect contributes in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : analytictransfer ] ) .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath41 implies that one requires factor of 10 greater change in the potential ( or @xmath42 ) to affect the quadrupole substantially ( see fig .",

    "the isw effect has little effect ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quadadi ] ) .",
    "contributions from the isw effect in the quadrupole actually originate from scales where @xmath43 where  de \" denotes the epoch of dark energy - matter equality .",
    "because the distance changes rapidly with redshift locally , the isw effect is spread out across over a factor of ten in physical scale with a peak centered near @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quadadi]a ) . at this wavenumber",
    "@xmath41 has a peak near @xmath46 corresponding to an efficient transfer of power .",
    "moreover since the decay occurs on the expansion time scale the oscillations in @xmath16 from @xmath47 in the isw integrand of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : analytictransfer ] ) are washed out in the transfer function .",
    "physically this reflects the cancellation of radial modes as photons travel in and out of decaying gravitational potentials along the line of sight .",
    "to lower the _ predicted _ value of the quadrupole , one can alter the fiducial model to lower the sw effect , the isw effect or both .",
    "since both effects contribute nearly equally , reducing one or the other can at best halve the power .",
    "of course , due to cosmic variance , it is possible that the _ observed _ quadrupole results from a lack of angular power in our given realization of the fiducial model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cladi ] we show the 68% and 95% cosmic variance confidence regions assuming that @xmath48 is distributed as a @xmath49 with @xmath50 degrees of freedom around the fiducial model .",
    "however again , a simple lack of power on large physical scales for our last scattering ( recombination ) surface is not sufficient .",
    "unless our local volume also lacks intermediate scale power as well , a chance occurrence of a low observed quadrupole would result from a chance cancellation of the sw and isw effects .",
    "the low multipole polarization and cross spectra provides key additional information to discriminate between alternatives . in the large scale limit ,",
    "it is approximately @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the thomson optical depth as measured from the observer .",
    "consider the transfer function of the polarization quadrupole .",
    "[ fig : quadadi ] shows that in the fiducial model it is generated before the temperature quadrupole is modified by the isw effect .",
    "consequently , the transfer function also peaks near the large scales of the sw peak of @xmath31 mpc@xmath45 . as eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : cl ] ) shows this overlap is also the origin of the temperature - polarization cross correlation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] , we show the @xmath53 and @xmath54 power spectra of the fiducial model .    if the explanation of the observed low quadrupole involves the dark energy , either through a dynamical effect or chance cancellation , one would expect a polarization quadrupole and hence @xmath53 power that is not anomalously low compared with the fiducial model .",
    "if on the other hand it involves an actual lack of predicted long - wavelength power in the model or by chance , both spectra would be low . finally ,",
    "if the explanation involved only the reduction of the isw effect and no modification of long wavelength power , then the predicted @xmath54 cross power spectrum would also remain unchanged .",
    "the fact that in the fiducial adiabatic model the temperature quadrupole receives comparable contributions from recombination and dark energy domination through the sw and isw effects raises the possibility that the low quadrupole originates in the dark energy sector . in the appendix we present a detailed treatment of perturbation theory in general dark energy models which provides the basis for results in this section .",
    "the essential element that defines the isw effect in the fiducial model is that the dark energy remains smooth out to the horizon scale and hence does not contribute density fluctuations to the gravitational potential .",
    "in general there are two ways to alter this conclusion : modify the dynamics of the dark energy so that dark matter fluctuations remain imprinted on the dark energy or modify the initial perturbations in the dark energy sector .",
    "since the dark energy has made a negligible contribution to the net energy density until recently , the latter represents contributions from an isocurvature initial condition . that dark energy isocurvature conditions can help to lower the quadrupole",
    "has recently been shown @xcite . here",
    "we present a general discussion on the requirements of such a model .",
    "the first requirement is that an initial dark energy perturbation must survive evolution in the radiation and matter dominated epoch and must remain correlated with the perturbations in the dark matter .",
    "the latter condition is required for the dark energy perturbations to cancel the adiabatic ones .",
    "let us take the dark energy to be a scalar field @xmath55 with the canonical kinetic term and a potential @xmath56 , i.e. quintessence .",
    "we treat the more general case of k - essence in the appendix .",
    "given that a quintessence field has an effective sound speed @xmath57 [ see eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : kessencesound ] ) ] , coherence well inside the horizon and hence cancellation with the adiabatic isw effect is not possible .",
    "the dark energy isocurvature mechanism then must operate on large scales to cancel the sw effect .",
    "recall that to achieve a coherent cancellation of the sw effect in the quadrupole one requires either a change of @xmath58 in the gravitational potential early on when @xmath59 or a larger change @xmath42 at @xmath32 to compensate for the inefficiency of the transfer of power to the quadrupole .",
    "given that observations require that @xmath60 today , the former possibility is excluded unless @xmath61 evolves substantially from its present value .    in a flat universe",

    "furthermore we shall see below that the order unity coefficient in front of @xmath68 is in practice substantially greater than unity .",
    "this requirement severely limits the range of quintessence models which can affect the quadrupole .",
    "as shown in the appendix , aside from transient initial condition effects , an isocurvature perturbation to the quintessence field @xmath69 at best remains constant outside the horizon and hence one requires a large initial fluctuation to the quintessence field .",
