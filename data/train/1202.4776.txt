    "the study of the dirichlet boundary value problem for the two - dimensional electrical impedance equation @xmath0 is fundamental for well understanding its inverse problem , usually know as electrical impedance tomography , and that was first posed in correct mathematical form by a. p. calderon @xcite in 1980 .",
    "it is remarkable that for more than twenty years after the problem was stated , the mathematical complexity of ( [ int00 ] ) could provoke that many experts considered _ impossible _ to obtain its general solution in analytic form @xcite , even for the simplest cases of @xmath1 .",
    "but the this conception turned around in 2005 , when v. kravchenko @xcite noticed that the two dimensional case of ( [ int00 ] ) was completely equivalent to a special kind of vekua equation @xcite .",
    "only one year latter , k. astala and l. pivrinta @xcite rediscovered independently this relation , and with it , they gave a positive answer to the calderon s problem in the plain .",
    "many other important results were obtained soon after . as an example , kravchenko _ et al . _ published in 2007 what can be considered the first general solution of ( [ int00 ] ) in analytic form @xcite , proposed for a certain class of conductivities @xmath1 , and employing taylor series in formal powers @xcite .",
    "but we would like to claim now special attention on a recent and relevant discovering : the proof of the completeness of the set of formal powers in bounded domains , for approaching solutions in the plain of the dirichlet problem for the electrical impedance equation @xcite .",
    "this will be valid when the conductivity function can be expressed by means of a separable - variables function .",
    "on the light of all these notorious advances , we want to emphasize that it is not clear yet how to fully apply the elements of the modern theory of pseudoanalytic functions @xcite into more specific , but still very important , engineering applications , as it is the electrical impedance tomography from the point of view of medical imaging .",
    "the main objective of this work is to start a discussion in this direction .",
    "even it is not clear if the proof provided in @xcite can be extended for the cases when @xmath1 is a separable - variables function , but piecewise - defined within a bounded domain , the numerical calculations show that the techniques employed in purely mathematical problems , could well be used for analysing some physical cases , providing quite acceptable results .",
    "basically , our work suggest that , if the values of the electrical conductivity are known at every point within a bounded domain , it will be always possible to introduce a piecewise separable - variables function that approaches the conductivity , and in consequence , to obtain a numerical orthonormal set of functions that seems to be capable of approaching solutions for the dirichlet boundary value problem of ( [ int00 ] )",
    ". this would be true for a certain class of bounded domains defined on the plain , but wide enough to include most relevant cases for experimental physics .",
    "we base our assessments onto a set of conductivity examples that tries to be as diverse as possible from the mathematical point of view . possessing for each example an analytic solution",
    ", we introduce their corresponding piecewise separable - variables conductivity functions , and employing them for the numerical calculations , we approach their corresponding analytic solutions valued at the boundary .",
    "then , a variety of qualitative and quantitative references are given , in order to estimate the effectiveness of the approach .",
    "we make special emphasis in those examples whose conductivity functions are not separable - variables by definition , showing that , at least for the analysed cases , the technique can be trustful",
    ". this would be an important step for performing experiments with other classes of conductivities , as those emerging from geometrical distributions , whose exact mathematical expressions are , in general , unknown .",
    "if our appreciations are correct , we would be one step closer for fully applying the modern pseudoanalytic function theory into medical imaging .",

    "therefore , any complex - valued function @xmath9 can be written by means of the linear combination of the pair @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are purely real - valued functions . based upon this idea",

    "nevertheless these operators are usually introduced with the factor @xmath18 , in this work will be somehow more convenient to work without it .    by introducing the notations @xmath19 the @xmath10-derivative of @xmath9 , presented in ( [ pre01 ] ) ,",

    "@xcite , and soon it will be seen that it possesses special significance for this work .",
    "it is also necessary to mention that every function @xmath9 , solution of ( [ pre05 ] ) , will be called @xmath10__-pseudoanalytic__.    the following statements were originally posed in @xcite .",

    "let the elements of the set @xmath31 be all generating pairs , and let every @xmath32 be a successor @xmath33 .",

    "the complete and detailed conditions for its existence can be found in @xcite and in @xcite , but they are out of the scope of this work . because of this , the elements we present in the upcoming paragraphs are only basic statements for supporting our results .",

    ", we will be able to approach any formal power @xmath71 ; at some certain point @xmath72 .",

    "this is , any boundary condition @xmath77 can be approached asymptotically by virtue of the linear combination of the elements belonging to ( [ eie03 ] ) : @xmath78 where the coefficients @xmath79 are all real constants .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "it is also possible to introduce an inner product for the set ( [ int00 ] ) , as it was stated in @xcite . in our particular case",

    "the effectiveness of these numerical calculations has been tried in several works ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "still , it will be very convenient for us to analyse here a pair of particular examples , before paying all our attention into more general cases .",
    "let us consider a conductivity function of the form @xmath87 in order to obtain at least one analytic solution for the electrical impedance equation , we will assume that ( [ int00 ] ) can be separated into a decoupled pair of sturm - liouville equations : @xmath88 it is remarkable that the modern pseudoanalytic function theory has also provided new results for this classical kind of equations . indeed , we could even approach the general solution for every equation of ( [ bs01 ] ) , in terms of taylor series in formal powers , employing the results posed in @xcite . yet , at the moment , we are only searching for particular solutions .    for this purpose ,",

    "moreover , applying the antiderivative with respect to @xmath94 to the last expression , we can easily verify that @xmath95 is a particular solution for the first equation of ( [ bs01 ] ) .",
    "an identical procedure will show us that @xmath96 where @xmath97 is an arbitrary function of @xmath94 , is a particular solution for the second . once we combine ( [ bs02 ] ) and ( [ bs03 ] )",
    ", we will immediately obtain that @xmath98 is an exact solution of the equation ( [ int00 ] ) .",
    "we have shown the full procedure because it will be useful for obtaining the required analytic solutions in every case we will study hereafter .",
    "let us now summarise this result in a short proposition .",
    "[ prop01 ] let @xmath99 .",
    "then the function @xmath100 , posed in ( [ bs04 ] ) , will be a particular solution of ( [ int00 ] ) .    generating a boundary condition @xmath77 from the particular solution shown in the previous proposition , is a very simple task .",
    "remembering that @xmath75 coincides with the perimeter of the unitary disk , we only have to consider @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for @xmath103 .",
    "we can now employ the numerical methods detailed in @xcite for obtaining a system of @xmath104 formal powers , defined at the boundary @xmath75 : @xmath105 that correspond to the exponential conductivity @xmath99 .",
    "we construct each formal power to be composed by @xmath106 complex values , associated with @xmath106 equidistantly distributed points on @xmath75 .",
    "then , after applying a standard gram - schmitt orthonormalising process over the real parts of ( [ bs05 ] ) , we will obtain a system of @xmath107 base functions @xmath108 ( the apparent loss of one function can be explained using the expression ( [ pre06 ] ) introduced in theorem [ theoremfg ] , and the definition [ predeffp ] : the formal power @xmath109 is purely imaginary , thus its real part @xmath110 ) .    hence , every function @xmath111 will posses @xmath106 real values along @xmath75 .",
    "if needed , we can always use the well known cubic spline interpolling method on every @xmath111 , to posses a set of continuous functions instead of a discrete one .",
    "our next step is to test the effectiveness of the set @xmath108 for approach solutions of the dirichlet problem for ( [ int00 ] ) , imposing the analytic solution ( [ bs04 ] ) as the boundary condition @xmath77 .",
    "specifically , we will evaluate ( [ bs04 ] ) at the points @xmath112 and the same will be done for every function of the set @xmath108 .",

    "we selected to do this in behalf of simplicity , but other techniques are available if required .",
    "the collocation method , successfully employed in @xcite , is an example of the last assessment .",
    "[ remarksequence ] the @xmath107 elements of the set @xmath108 were obtained by applying the gram - schmitt orthonormalising process , considering first all the elements of the set @xmath115 and consequently the elements of @xmath116    as expected , the absolute error @xmath117 will be defined according to the lebesgue norm : @xmath118    the figure [ fig : bs00a ] shows the plot of the boundary condition @xmath77 and the plot of the approached solution , being the horizontal axis the perimeter of the unitary disk . as the reader can appreciate , it is technically impossible to detect any difference in plain sight between these two graphics . that is why , when this case occurs , we will not display the illustration , focusing our attention into some of the most relevant coefficients @xmath119 , and the absolute error @xmath117 defined in ( [ bs08 ] ) .",

    "this second class of conductivity distributions is among the most interesting for several branches of experimental physics , as it is the medical imaging .",
    "but it is clear that the characterization of the new method over this class of conductivities , can only be adequately achieved by comparing its numerical results with those provided by some of the finest variations of the finite element method , that have proved to be the best tool to approach solutions for dirichlet boundary value problems in the plain .",
    "we must also emphasize that we have studied only one class of piecewise separable - variables conductivity approach . indeed , to try again the posed examples , and as much of their variations as it is possible , using other ideas for obtaining separable - variables expressions at every subsection , will enrich our understanding of this new technique from the mathematical point of view .    on the same direction ,",
    "it is also necessary to formally extend the proof of completeness provided in @xcite , if such was possible , for piecewise separable - variables functions . about this",
    ", the authors do not detect at the present any immediate way to start accomplishing the task .",
    "and we still have to take into account all material related to the computational complexity of the new posed numerical methods , that was completely out of the scope of the current paper .",
    "yet , this path could be somehow clearer to start exploring , if we keep in mind that our ultimate objective is to apply the methods for medical imaging problems , so it will be obligatory to include the computational cost and time as two parameters for evaluating the technical efficiency of the new methods .",
    "this because the known algorithms for approaching solutions for the inverse problem , are based on the recursive resolution of the direct dirichlet boundary value problem .",
    "still , we are certain to be searching in the correct direction , because the techniques provided by the pseudoanalytic function theory , classical @xcite@xcite , and modern @xcite , are proving to be specially powerful in mathematical physics , e.g. , these techniques could well prove useful in an assortment relevant applications , as it is the fourier transform of the two - dimensional fokker - planck equation , studied in @xcite , as well as some certain special cases of the diffusion equation employed into hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite .",
