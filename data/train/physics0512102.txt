    "a reasonably well experimentally established anomalous ( multi ) scaling of the structure functions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are components of the velocity field parallel and perpendicular to the displacement vector @xmath10 , respectively , is one of the properties of strong turbulence which makes it `` the last unsolved problem of continuum mechanics '' . [",
    "the anomalous dimension , a property of strongly interacting systems first introduced to the quantum field theory by gribov and migdal [ 5 ] and polyakov [ 6 ] , is a notoriously difficult from theoretical viewpoint concept and only recently , after many years of trying , the theory of anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a passive scalar advected by a white - in - time random velocity field , has been developed [ 7]-[8 ] .",
    "almost simultaneously , the theory of bi - scaling in turbulence generated by the forced burgers equation [ 9]-[10 ] was formulated . the attempts to explain anomalous dimensions in three dimensional turbulence were made in refs.[11]-[12 ] .",
    "it was shown that the navier - stokes equations combined with a simple model for the pressure -velocity correlations , lead to homogeneous differential equations for the structure functions and , as a result , to anomalous scaling exponents which can not be obtained on dimensional grounds .    during last forty - fifty years",
    ", a substantial effort was devoted to derivation or at least modeling of various probability densities in turbulence .",
    "the first attempts resulting in the log - normal pdf of the dissipation rate fluctuations , consistent with the multi - scaling , were made by kolmogorov [ 13 ] and yaglom [ 14 ] , using a simple cascade model .",
    "this result was later criticized by orszag [ 15 ] as , in general , not realizable .",
    "similar log - normal pdf was obtained for the not too large magnitudes of velocity increment @xmath11 in ref . [ 11 ] , which was later experimentally tested by kurien and sreenivasan [ 3 ] .",
    "some other attempts based on analysis of experimental data led to various fits ranging from log - normal and log - poison expressions to exponential and `` stretched exponential '' pdfs @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we , addressing this problem , will restrict ourselves by considerations based on equations of motion .    this paper is organized in a following way . in the section 2",
    "we introduce the mellin transform for the probability density of velocity increments and define the large- scale gaussian boundary condition .",
    "we show that the `` normal ( linear ) scaling '' corresponds to the gaussaian pdf of the small - scale fluctuations .",
    "the pdf accounting for small deviations from the linear scaling is calculated and compared with traditional log - normal expressions . in section 3 , we based on theoretical analysis of the navier - stokes equations and numerical simulations by gotoh and nakano [ 16 ] , justify the boundary conditions used for the derivation of sec 2 .",
    "the random field of the dissipation scales @xmath0 ( linear dimensions of the dissipative structures ) , derived from the expression for the dissipation anomaly , is introduced in sec 4 and the pdf @xmath3 is computed in section 5 .",

    "this derivation which did not involve the steepest descent evaluation of the integral does not have a `` log - problem '' , discussed in ref . [",
    "the experimental measurements of cramer function @xmath232 for @xmath233 by meneveau and sreenivasan [ 31 ] ( see also ref.[1 ] ) are in an extremely close agreement with this expression .",
    "the quantitative differences are : the maximum of the calculated curve ( with @xmath234 ) is at @xmath235 ( instead of @xmath236 of ref .",
    "[ 31 ] ) and @xmath237 at @xmath238 and @xmath239 compared with @xmath240 and @xmath241 of ref.[31 ] .",
    "the small deviations come from the difference between @xmath233 used for analysis of experimental data and the theoretically obtained @xmath242 .",
    "this difference decreases if the coordinates are rescaled by factor @xmath243 .",
    "the second part of the mf theory , dealing with the small - scale properties of turbulence , is based on the relation ( paladin and vulpiani [ 32 ] ) @xmath244    obtained by combining the mf assumption ( 27 ) and the outcome of the balance of the advective and viscous contributions to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "all small - scale results derived using the mf formalism are numerically indistinguishable from the ones obtained both above and in the ref .",
    "[ 18 ] . to illustrate this point",
    ", we present an alternative derivation of the moments of velocity derivative due to polyakov [ 33 ] .    * polyakov s derivation*. the probability density of velocity difference in the inertial range is :    @xmath245)>\\ ] ]    and in the dissipation ( analytic ) range @xmath246 assuming the two pdfs match at the scale @xmath247 , introduced by ( 15 ) , we have :    @xmath248    multiplying ( 33 ) by @xmath249 and integrating over @xmath8 gives :    @xmath250    the integral is evaluated at a pole where @xmath251 giving    @xmath252    with    @xmath253    which is identical to the formula ( 8.76 ) of frisch s book [ 1 ] obtained using multi - fractal theory . comparing the relations ( 35 ) and ( 22 ) we find that , on the accepted magnitudes of exponents @xmath21 , numerically they are basically identical for not too large moment numbers @xmath46 .",
    "it is also easy to see that if in the limit @xmath254 , @xmath255 with @xmath256 , the two relations have the same asymptotics .",
    "the only approximation involved in derivations of both relations ( 22 ) and ( 35 ) , presented in this paper , is the choice of the cut - off @xmath257 instead of @xmath258 . in reality , there exist a random field of the dissipation scales described by the probability density @xmath183 given by ( 25 ) .",
    "thus , a more accurate calculation of both ( 22 ) and ( 34 ) must involve averaging over the fluctuating cut- off @xmath0 .",
    "however , we do not expect this procedure to introduce substantial modifications of the obtained results .",
    "the theory presented here does not involve any multi - fractal assumptions . still , the quantitative ( numerical ) agreements between the two approaches hints on the possibility of some qualitative connection . the essentially dynamic theory developed here couples the velocity fluctuations at the largest and smallest scales",
    "one may speculate that if a typical structure is basically a strongly convoluted sheet with two @xmath259 linear dimensions and @xmath260 the third one , then these structures can loosely be identified with the multi - ifractal sets of the mf theory .",
