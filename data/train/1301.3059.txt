    "rare - earth neutron - rich nuclei offer an opportunity to study singular aspects of nuclear structure around the midshell region such as new modes of excitation and collectivity , the role of the single - particle levels @xcite and even possible modifications of shell structure .",
    "nevertheless , despite the recent progress in experimental techniques , the rare - earth neutron - rich nuclei remains a region of the nuclear chart which has been seldom studied .",
    "for example , in heavy - ion induced multinucleon transfer reaction , the combination of stable projectiles and stable targets has unfavorable kinematic matching conditions leading to heavy neutron - rich nuclei , resulting in small cross sections that limits its use for populating neutron - rich nuclei @xcite . in this region",
    ", nuclei have large numbers of valence protons and neutrons , and many low - lying collective nuclear properties are expected to appear there .",
    "for example , er , yb and hf neutron - rich nuclei exhibit a minimum in the @xmath8 energies and a maximum of deformation at n=104 @xcite . assuming standard spherical shell gaps , @xmath4dy has the larger number of valence particles of any nucleus lighter than the doubly magic lead , and hence it is expected to be the most collective nucleus in the region @xcite .",
    "experimental works in the lighter dysprosium isotopes have shown that there is an enhancement of the collectivity in @xmath9dy , a relative flatness of the moment of inertia in @xmath10dy , and @xmath11dy shows again an apparent enhancement of deformation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to date the energies of the levels in @xmath4dy have not been measured , and hence its degree of collectivity is still unknown . in addition , the known saturation of b(e2 ) in the region @xcite and the decrease in moment of inertia between n=98 - 100 in the gadolinium isotopes @xcite open the following question of the collectivity in the region : is @xmath4dy indeed the most collective of the region or is a little of the collectivity lost when we reach n=104 .    among the different chanels for producing the dysprosium neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "quasielastic two - neutron transfer reaction has been used to study the neutron - rich @xmath10dy @xcite , two - proton pick - up reaction allowed to populate @xmath11dy @xcite , and projectile fragmentation of @xmath12pb was used @xcite to synthetize the midshell @xmath4dy .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the large valence spaces associated with heavy - nuclei have implied a slow progress , limiting the number of models capable of dealing with @xmath4dy .",
    "the earlier studies of this nucleus have used the relativistic mean - field calculations @xcite , the strutinsky shell correction @xcite , the generator co - ordinate method @xcite , and the monte carlo shell - model @xcite .",
    "more recently , p. h. regan _",
    "@xcite used the cranked shell - model with nonaxial deformed woods - saxon potential , and predicted a highly deformed @xmath4dy nucleus with a pure axial symmetric - shape deformation along the yrast line and a @xmath13 = @xmath14 isomeric state at an approximated energy of 1.2 mev .    a shell model description @xcite of heavy nuclei",
    "requires further assumptions that include a systematic and proper truncation of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the symmetry based su(3 ) shell model @xcite has been successfully applied in light nuclei , where a harmonic oscillator mean - field and a residual quadrupole - quadrupole interaction can be used to describe dominant features of the nuclear spectra .",
    "however , the strong spin - orbit interaction renders the su(3 ) model useless in heavier nuclei , while at the same time pseudo - spin emerges as a good symmetry @xcite .",
    "the origin of this symmetry has been traced back to the relativistic mean field for heavy - nuclei @xcite , and the success of the pseudo - su(3 ) model @xcite lies on the consistency of this symmetry . on other hand , the backbending phenomenon in @xmath15dy chain has been studied with the projected shell model @xcite .",
    "the first applications of the pseudo - su(3 ) model considered pseudo - spin as a dynamical symmetry @xcite . with",
    "the development of a computer code came a technical breakthrough that enabled mixed - representation calculations for calculating reduced matrix elements of physical operators ( i.e. the symmetry - breaking nilsson single - particle energies or pairing correlations ) between different su(3 ) irreps @xcite .",
    "this enabling technology allows fully microscopic studies of energy levels belonging to normal parity bands and transitions @xcite .",
    "the study of abnormal parity bands of rare earth nuclei , in addition of those with normal parity , requires the explicit consideration of intruder levels , which may be performed using the quasi - su(3 ) scheme , as it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , coupling the intruder states of the quasi - su(3 ) with those of normal parity described by the pseudo - su(3 ) . in reference",
    "@xcite the authors report some calculations of the quadrupole properties of @xmath16cr and e2 transition probabilities of the nd , sm , gd and dy nuclei with 92 @xmath17 n @xmath17 98 , showing the value of this theoretical framework , because their predictions are very close to values reported experimentally . in the @xmath18-shell ,",
    "the quasi - su(3 ) scheme was applied to describe even - even , even - odd and odd - odd nuclei @xcite",
    ".    however , a calculation of rare - earth nuclei which considers the coupling of quasi- and pseudo su(3)-schemes is impossible at this time due to computational challenges unresolved yet .",
    "the first step in the development of these codes would be the building of the basis , which will emerge of the coupling of normal with intruder states , mixing the occupation numbers associated to each subspace .",
    "in this case , the use of pseudo + quasi scheme ( p and q , respectively ) would involve the following couplings    @xmath19    where the first row is for protons , the second is for neutrons and the third shows the final coupling that might be used in the description of the whole nucleus and where it has not been considered the changes in occupation numbers .",
    "the second step would be the extension of the hamiltonian to include the coupling with the particles in the intruder sector .",
    "these two major extensions would give us the ability of realize an comprehensive description of heavy nuclei , as for example the study of abnormal parity bands , and the reduction of huge effective charges used up to now .    in order to illustrate this calculation , we can take as example the nucleus @xmath20dy .",
    "it has 66 protons and 94 - 104 neutrons , and of these , 16 protons and 12 neutrons are in the last unfilled ( open ) shells . assuming a deformation @xmath21 ,",
    "the deformed nilsson single - particle levels of the active shells are filled from below @xcite .",
    "ten protons are distributed in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals of the @xmath24 = 4 shell , and the remaining six occupy the @xmath25 intruder orbital .",
    "eight neutrons occupy the @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals of the @xmath24 = 5 shell and four are in @xmath28 orbital",
    ". this calculation would consider a total of 28 nucleons in active shells , which increases the computational time by several orders of magnitude ; so even considering the use of symmetries it would be necessary to modify the current codes to increase their efficiency .",
    "these studies are beyond the goals of this work and are left as future extensions of the model .",
    "nevertheless , following the suggestions of the refs .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to employ the quasi - su(3 ) scheme to estimate the contributions of the intruder sector to the quadrupole moments ( @xmath29 ) and relate them to the e2 transition probability , eliminating the use of the extremely large effective charges .    in this article ,",
    "we present for the first time an application of the pseudo - su(3 ) model to the @xmath2dy chain , where the most relevant quadrupole - quadrupole , nilsson single - particle and pairing terms are parametrized systematically and at the same time , a best fit of the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is done for this set of nuclei .",
    "the calculations for these known nuclei are extrapolated towards the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath4dy .",
    "previous applications of the model made use of several nucleus by nucleus fitting procedure of several parameters , not allowing a systematic study of the evolution of properties ( for example , the modifications in the moment of inertia of rotational bands ) along chains of nuclei and making unreal the extrapolations predicting the spectroscopy of unmeasured nucleus . in the present approach ,",
    "our goal is to study the evolution of collectivity along the dysprosium isotopic chain ( z=66 ) starting at n = 94 and ending with predictions for ground - state , @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands in the n = 104 midshell @xmath4dy nucleus . to this end",
    ", the procedure we have followed is to employ a model with the nilsson , quadrupole - quadrupole and pairing terms of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) systematically parametrized @xcite in function of the mass ( @xmath33 ) , whereas the parameters of the last three terms [ @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 were determined by applying a best - fit procedure to the experimental data in all the chain .    in section ii a brief description of the pseudo - su(3 ) classification scheme and the hamiltonian of the model are discussed .",
    "theoretical energies of levels , comparision with data ( when available ) for ground - state , @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands in @xmath20dy , @xmath40dy , @xmath9dy , @xmath10dy and @xmath11dy , predictions in @xmath4dy and the analysis of collectivity implied are presented in the section iii .",
    "intra and inter - band b(e2 ) transitions are presented in section iv , and finally , a brief conclusion is given in section v.",
    "the selection of the many - body basis is the starting point for any shell - model application .",
    "many - particle states of @xmath41 active nucleons ( @xmath42 ) in a given ( @xmath43 ) normal parity shell @xmath44 are classified by the following group chain @xcite :    @xmath45    where above each group the quantum numbers that characterize its irreducible representations ( irreps ) are given . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are multiplicity labels of the indicated reductions .",
    "the occupation numbers for protons are constant along the chain . in shell model applications ,",
    "the dysprosium isotopes are considered to have 16 protons out of the z = 50 inert core , 10 of these in normal and 6 in abnormal @xmath48 parity levels . in table [ occupations ]",
    "the occupation numbers for neutrons assigned to each nucleus are presented .",
    ".deformation ( @xmath49 ) @xcite and occupation numbers for neutrons ( @xmath50 ) . the superscript @xmath43 and @xmath33 indicate normal and abnormal parity levels , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the total pseudo - spin content of the nuclear wave function is built through the coupling of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 components . as it has been the case in previous works with the model , the ground - state bands in the chain of isotopes @xmath53dy",
    "are composed predominantly by @xmath54 , with very small mixing of the @xmath55 , varying from 0@xmath56 in @xmath9dy to 19@xmath56 in @xmath20dy .",
    "the @xmath0-bands have larger components of @xmath55 , varying from 7@xmath56 in @xmath9dy to 90@xmath56 in @xmath10dy",
    ". large components of @xmath55 are also observed in @xmath1-bands .",
    "the pseudo - spin contents for each band are practically constant along all states of the band .",
    "these results show the importance of the @xmath55 contribution in the description of excited @xmath0 and @xmath1-bands .",
    "the pseudo - su(3 ) shell model offers a quantitative microscopic description of heavy deformed nuclei . for the first time , employing a systematically parametrized hamiltonian and the best fit of three parameters for a set of nuclei , the model has been used to study energies and b(e2 ) transitions of the chain of dysprosium isotopes and to predict the excitation energies in the ground - state , @xmath0 and @xmath1-bands in @xmath4dy .",
    "the model describes a maximum of collectivity in @xmath11dy , but it fails in @xmath9dy where no enhancement of collectivity is found . in @xmath4dy a lower degree of collectivity is found , corroborating the tendency found in @xmath57gd isotopes @xcite , where the moment of inertia between @xmath58 decrease . at the present , the explanation for this loss of collectivity in @xmath9dy and @xmath4dy is the absence of a dynamical treatment of the intruder states in the model , presenting a challenge for future works .",
    "intra- and inter - band b(e2 ) transition strengths were presented , showing very collective bands and some degree of mixing between ground - state and @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "likewise , it was shown that the explicit consideration of the intruder sector using the quasi - su(3 ) symmetry allows to employ realistic effective charges .",
    "nevertheless , the large effective charges used in our calculations work adequately to compensate the absence of the intruder sector in our model , as it was checked for the b(e2;@xmath59 ) strength , where the values obtained with the large effective charges are similar to those obtained with realistic effective charges when is considered the effect of the abnormal parity states within a quasi - su(3 ) scheme",
    ". a more complete study of the rare earth neutron - rich region , exploiting the quasi - su(3 ) symmetry to include dynamically the intruder states , would be a natural extension of the present work .",
    "in addition , we have presented the prediction of the model for the @xmath60 isomeric state in @xmath4dy , which is at an energy of 1048 kev , lower that the value of ref .",
    "finally , the results presented confirm the adequacy of the model to predict properties of rare - earth exotic nuclei .",
    "experimental information for the neutron - rich nuclei is highly desired to understand nuclear structure around the midshell region .",
