    "the quantum behavior of superfluids is most evident when they are placed in a rotating container .",
    "while a slow rotation may lead to the appearance of quantized vortices or quenching of the moment of inertia  @xcite , rapidly - rotating systems may exhibit integer and fractional quantum - hall physics  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) involves an intrinsic angular momentum , caused by coupling the particle s spin to its momentum , and it has become one of the key themes in modern condensed - matter and atomic physics , playing a central role for systems such as topological insulators and superconductors  @xcite , quantum spin - hall systems  @xcite , and spintronics applications  @xcite .    hence , the interplay between rotation and soc is expected to pave the way for novel quantum phenomena , and recent realizations of soc in atomic gases have already set the stage for such a task in a highly - controllable setting  @xcite .",
    "while only the nist - type soc has so far been achieved , there also exist various proposals on how to create a purely rashba soc  @xcite , the possibility of which has stimulated numerous theoretical studies on rashba - fermi gases in three  @xcite as well as two  @xcite dimensions .",
    "these works have revealed a plethora of intriguing phenomena , including topological superfluids , majorana modes , spin textures , skyrmions , etc .",
    ", which may soon be observed given the recent advances in producing a two - dimensional fermi gas  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the cooperation of adiabatic rotation and rashba soc on the ground - state phases of a trapped fermi gas assuming that vortices are not excited .",
    "adiabaticity requires that the rotation is introduced slowly to the system .",
    "in particular the rate of change of rotation frequency should be much smaller than the quasiparticle excitation frequency for vortex creation . in the absence of a soc , effects of rotation on three - dimensional fermi gases",
    "have previously been studied under this assumption at unitarity using the quantum monte carlo equations of state together with the local - density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , and throughout the bcs - bec evolution using the bcs mean - field approximation together both with lda  @xcite and the bogoliubov - de gennes approach  @xcite .",
    "these works have shown that , by breaking some of the superfluid ( sf ) pairs via the coriolis effects , rotation gives rise to a phase separation between a non - rotating sf core at the center and a rigidly - rotating normal ( n ) particles at the outer edge  @xcite , with a partially - rotating gapless sf ( gsf ) region in between where the sf pairs and n particles coexist together  @xcite .",
    "since the effects of the coriolis force on a neutral particle in the rotating frame are similar to those of the lorentz force on a charged particle in a magnetic field , current advances in simulating artificial fields with ultracold atoms opens alternative ways of effectively realizing a rotating fermi gas with soc .",
    "in addition , more recent works have confirmed that pair - breaking scenario is energetically more favored against vortex formation in a sizeable parameter regime  @xcite , and experimental schemes for realizing a rotating spin - orbit coupled system are described in  @xcite .",
    "in the presence of a rashba soc , we first take the harmonic confinement into account via both the semi - classical lda and exact approaches , and find the parameter regime where the non - interacting gas forms a ring - shaped annulus .",
    "neither rotation nor soc alone can deplete the central density to zero no matter how fast the rotation or large soc is , and the formation of such an intriguing annulus requires them both simultaneously .",
    "then , we take the interactions into account via the bcs mean - field , and analyze the pair - breaking mechanism in the entire bcs - bec evolution . in particular , we show that the cooperation of rotation and soc allows for the possibility of creating either an isolated annulus of n particles that is disconnected from the central sf core or separated from it by an intermediate gsf phase as sketched in fig .",

    "[ fig : freen](a ) , while increasing @xmath81 initially increases @xmath59 near the central region due to the increase in the low - energy density of states , the @xmath68 states gain further energy through their angular momentum in the rotating frame , and @xmath59 decreases dramatically away from the center as @xmath81 increases further .",
    "as the critical condition is approached , the latter effect gradually dominates causing central density to decrease as the gas continues to expand , and @xmath85 eventually vanishes beyond @xmath86 .",
    "we also see a similar behavior in fig .  [",

    "in contrast to increasing @xmath81 , however , increasing @xmath83 not only decreases @xmath85 but also expands the gas monotonically .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that neither rotation nor soc alone can deplete @xmath85 to zero no matter how fast @xmath83 or large @xmath81 is , and the formation of an annulus requires them both simultaneously .    in the non - interacting limit , we benchmark our semi - classical results with those of exact quantum - mechanical treatment and find an excellent agreement between the two for all parameters including the fast @xmath83 and/or large @xmath81 limits .",

    "since vortices are assumed not to be excited in the system and the gapped sf can not carry the angular momentum , some of the sf pairs must eventually break by the centrifugal effects , _",
    "i.e. _ , via the broken time - reversal symmetry , giving rise to gsf and n regions in the trap . in this paper , we distinguish gsf from sf by checking whether @xmath90 is non - zero or not , or equivalently whether @xmath91 has negative regions in @xmath92 space or not .",
    "in addition , while both gsf and n phases have @xmath93 , only the n region rotates rigidly as a whole with @xmath94 .     and @xmath95 in ( a ) , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 in ( b ) , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "[ fig : omc](a ) is one of our primary results in this paper and should be read as follows . for a given @xmath81 shown on the horizontal axis , increasing @xmath83 in the vertical direction breaks sf pairs beyond the intersection with the @xmath102 curve .",
    "this diagram intuitively suggests that @xmath102 increases with increasing @xmath89 for a given @xmath81 .",
    "more importantly , it also shows that , in contrast to the @xmath106 limit where sf pairs are perfectly robust against @xmath74 when @xmath112 , finite @xmath81 eventually allows @xmath83 to create an n phase for any @xmath89 with @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , depending on whether the intersection with the @xmath102 curve is to the left or to the right of the ( red ) cross marks , we know whether an intermediate gsf phase exists or not at the sf - n interface . in the former case ,",
    "the gsf phase may eventually disappear with further increase in @xmath83 , so that the n phase ends up again being disconnected from the sf core ( not shown in the phase diagram ) .",
    "thus , the gsf phase always emerges for any @xmath114 in the @xmath106 limit , and the n particles form an isolated annulus practically for any @xmath115 as long as @xmath65 .",
    "we note that increasing @xmath89 moves the cross marks to lower @xmath81 because faster @xmath102 leads to an annulus of n particles at smaller @xmath81 , as discussed for the non - interacting problem .",
    "it is also possible to obtain an analytic expression for the small-@xmath81 dependence of @xmath102 on the left side of the cross marks , by again noting that the first broken pair emerges as n particles at the edge @xmath116 of the gas .",

    "physically , since @xmath65 shifts the excitation minima to higher momenta , the lowest - energy states become more susceptible to rotation , making it easier for @xmath83 to break the sf pairs at least in the small-@xmath81 limit .",

    "[ fig : omc](a ) also shows that @xmath102 curve develops a minimum as a function of @xmath81 when @xmath122 .",
