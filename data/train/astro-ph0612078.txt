    "a region of 100 arcmin@xmath3 around the hubble deep field north ( hdfn 10-arcmin field ) was observed by the uk radio interferometer merlin and the usa vla @xcite .",
    "92 sources brighter than 40 @xmath1jy were found in the combined images , which reach a noise level of @xmath4jy using beam sizes of @xmath5 .",
    "these are the only observations apart from the hst images which provide morphological information .",
    "8.4-ghz data are also available for most of the field @xcite allowing the radio spectral indices to be calculated .",
    "we employed data access , crossmatching and manipulation tools now available via the astrogrid workbench and the eurovo .",
    "these include the vizier and aladin services , topcat and a cut - out extractor for radio images which uses the parseltongue scripting interface developed by radionet .",

    "can radio emission originate from a process different from the x - ray source in the same galaxy ?",
    "if so , how much radiation has a common origin and how much is separate ? 2 .",
    "are high - redshift starbursts just analogues of local ulirgs or are they a distinct phenomenon only seen in the early universe ?",
    "the presence of rest - frame fir emission @xcite , the hst images @xcite and other non - radio data were used for supporting information but not as the primary classification criteria .",
    "we were thus able to classify the specific origins of the radio emission in each galaxy , which may be different from the sources of optical and other radiation from the same object .",
    "compact bright peaks with a flat radio spectrum are probably agn , especially if radio lobes extend beyond the optical limits .",
    "extended emission with a steep non - thermal spectrum is likely to be of starburst origin and in some cases optical knots of starformation can be seen .",
    "the latter are often associated with _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ or scuba sources @xcite and with interacting or distorted galaxies in the _ hst _ images .",

    "3 out of every 4 @xmath1jy sources are starbursts , including those with x - ray counterparts .",

    "chandra _ source with luminosity @xmath7 w is probably an agn .",
    "if it has a hard photon index ( @xmath8 ) , this indicates the presence of an obscured ( type-2 ) agn @xcite .",
    "64 type-2 agn were identified in the 10-arcmin field @xcite . over half of the x - ray sources with merlin+vla counterparts",
    "have @xmath9 w , 18 of which are classed as type-2 agn .",
    "these are shown by a blue a in fig .  2 .",

    "under 1/3 x - ray sources in the hdfn have radio counterparts .",
    "this rises to over 1/2 at higher redshift and in most of these the high x - ray luminosity indicates the presence of an agn .",
    "the @xmath11 relationship for starbursts at @xmath12 @xcite breaks down at higher @xmath0 where we see a dramatic increase in the scatter in fig .",
    "this is the case even if only the soft - band or the de - absorbed hard - band x - ray luminosity is considered .",
    "half of the 18 x - ray selected type-2 agn with radio counterparts are at @xmath13 , all but one of which are radio starbursts .",
    "two also have radio agn cores .",
    "a large proportion of these objects are scuba sources , whose x - ray properties are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "all 4 of the radio agn identified with x - ray type-2 agn , with no starburst signature , are at lower redshifts .",
    "the mean angular size of the radio sources in the hdfn is @xmath14 , corresponding to a typical extent of 810 kpc for starbursts and the inferred starformation rates are 10002000 m@xmath15 yr@xmath16 for the higher - redshift sources .",
    "this is an order of magnitude more exended and more vigourous than the behaviour of any objects at @xmath2 .",
