    "the investigation of magnetism in the molecule - based solid prussian blue , fe@xmath5[fe(cn)@xmath2@xmath6h@xmath4o , and related analogs has a rich history @xcite , dating back to 1928 @xcite .",
    "measurements down to liquid helium temperatures identified the transition to long - range ferromagnetic order @xcite , but an understanding of the magnetic interactions remained elusive until the 1970s , when x - ray @xcite and neutron @xcite diffraction data identified the crystal structure and the spin delocalization from high - spin fe(iii ) to low - spin fe(ii ) .",
    "interest in these materials was renewed in the 1990s with the synthesis of several mixed - metal prussian blue analogs with higher magnetic ordering temperatures , along with the 1996 discovery of long - lived photoinduced magnetism in k@xmath7co@xmath8[fe(cn)@xmath2@xmath9h@xmath4o @xcite .",
    "a flurry of experimental and theoretical research has elucidated the fundamental nature of the light - induced effects in three - dimensional bulk materials @xcite , and recent efforts have been made to integrate the photoinduced magnetism into films @xcite and nanoparticles , which have technical and biophysical applications .",
    "there have been several efforts to synthesize nanoparticles of prussian blue analogs @xcite , but only a few examples of photoinduced magnetism in these particles have been reported ,  including work that isolated k@xmath0co@xmath1[fe(cn)@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath4o particles with typical diameters of @xmath10  nm within a silica xerogel @xcite and other research producing 11  nm @xmath11 70  nm nanorods of mo(cn)@xmath12cu@xmath4 protected by polyvinylpyrrolidone ( pvp ) @xcite . in each case , although photoinduced magnetism was observed , the particles did not exhibit long - range order .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report our ability to synthesize rb@xmath0co@xmath1[fe(cn)@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath4o nanoparticles protected by pvp that exhibit photoinduced magnetism for all sizes and that possess long - range ordering , with coercive fields ranging between 0.25  @xmath13  1.5  kg , in the larger particles .",

    "finite values for this difference can only arise from photoinduced magnetism .",
    "[ fig3],width=288 ]",
    "it is noteworthy to recall that the photoinduced magnetism of the prussian blue analogs depends upon a charge transfer induced spin crossover event ( ctist effect ) , requiring the presence of vacancies to allow crystalline flexibility @xcite .",
    "more specifically for rb@xmath0co@xmath1[fe(cn)@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath4o , the spins of an co@xmath13fe pair can exist in either of two arrangements .",
    "the low - spin state consists of co(iii ) ( @xmath47 ) and fe(ii ) ( @xmath47 ) , while the high - spin state possesses co(ii ) ( @xmath48 ) and fe(iii ) ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the presence of the ctist effect depends on the local chemical environment defined by the values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the chemical formula . for limiting ratios , co and fe spins",
    "can be locked into either their high - spin or low - spin states for all accessible temperatures . alternatively , with the proper tuning of the chemical ratios",
    ", the co and fe ions can exist in high - spin states at room temperature and then experience a crossover to their low - spin states at approximately 150  k. the spin crossover phenomenon generates the pairs involved in the photoinduced magnetism .",
    "however , since the ctist effect may not be 100% efficient , some regions remain locked in their high - spin states , and we refer to them as _ primordial _ spins @xcite . for example , these primordial spins are responsible for the magnetic signals observed for the dark state of the largest particles . when irradiated , the low - spin regions , near the primordial high - spin clusters , are photoinduced to the high - spin magnetic state , resulting in a growth of the magnetic domain .",
    "this scenario is supported by our description of the anisotropic photoinduced magnetism observed in thin films @xcite and by the local probe investigations of others @xcite .",
    "all samples show a photoinduced increase in their magnetic signals , and the strength of the change is correlated with the size of the particles .",
    "the differences between the fc susceptibilities of the light and dark states , @xmath54 are plotted in the insets of fig .",
    "3 , and finite values can only arise from the photoinduced magnetism .",
    "it is important to stress that photoinduced magnetism is observed even in small particles possessing only curie - like behavior .    ) and fc ( @xmath45 ) states show a signal associated with long - range order for the two batches displaying a mix of magnetic behavior after subtracting the curie - like contribution .",
    "the susceptibility of batch  a only exhibits a curie - like contribution , while the magnetic signal for batch  d is dominated by spins that are ordered , see text for details . for each sample ,",
    "a curie - like contribution was obtained by fitting the dark state data above 30  k , and this magnetic signal was subtracted from the fc and zfc dark state data shown in fig .  3 . [ fig4],width=288 ]    two main features are seen when considering the evolution of material properties due to the increasing average size of the separate batches , namely the onset of long - range magnetic order and an increasing net magnetization .",
    "this scaling of magnetization is linked to an increased diamagnetic - surface to magnetically - active - volume ratio at smaller particle sizes . at low temperatures ,",
    "the high - spin co and fe ions interact antiferromagnetically , giving rise to a ferrimagnetic transition at @xmath55 , which is about 24  k for bulk powder specimens with a similar chemical formula @xcite . for the magnetic data shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "the onset of this transition can be estimated , and these macroscopic temperatures are listed in table  1 .",
    "we contend that particles larger than a critical size will allow domains large enough to approach bulk - like magnetic properties .",
    "conversely , smaller particles may put limits on allowed domain size , suppressing the ordering temperature .",
    "microscopically , if the size of the magnetic domains is less than or of the order of the magnetic coherence length , then a spectrum of @xmath55 values can be expected , and evidence of this trend is observed in batches c and d , see the insets of fig .",
    "3 . in other words",
    ", the size distributions may include particles both above and below the critical size that leads to bulk - like properties . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic response of each batch may include contributions from curie - like and bulk - like fractions .",
    "the percentage of each can be estimated by subtracting a curie - like signal from each @xmath56 plot , and the results for batches b and c are shown in fig .",
    "in contrast , batch  a follows curie - like behavior , whereas the active sites in batch  d are almost entirely ferrimagnetically ordered .",
    "this analysis of the data suggests the curie - like contribution for each of the four batches of nanoparticles ( smallest to largest ) is 100% , 90% , 50% , and 10% . consequently ,",
    "at least down to 2  k , nanoparticles with sizes below @xmath57  nm do not exhibit long - range order .",
    "these interpretations are consistent with our @xmath58 versus @xmath59 measurements performed at 2  k , where coercive fields , @xmath60 , and remnant magnetization values are observed for the largest sets of particles but not for the smallest set of particles , fig .  5 and table  1 .",
    "furthermore , the differences between the fc and zfc data for the dark states in batches b , c , and d are consistent with spin glass or cluster glass behavior @xcite , and our ac susceptibility data are presented in the appendix .",
    "k magnetization versus magnetic field sweeps for the two largest sizes of nanoparticles , batches c and d , are shown for the light ( @xmath61 and @xmath46 ) and dark ( @xmath62 and @xmath45 ) states .",
    "the coercive fields , @xmath60 for the light and dark states for each batch are listed in table  1 , and the lines are guides for the eyes .",
    "[ fig5],width=480 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have synthesized four different sizes of rb@xmath0co@xmath1[fe(cn)@xmath2@xmath63h@xmath4o nanoparticles protected by pvp .",
    "each batch of particles exhibits photoinduced magnetism , but the strength of this effect , as well as other global properties , e.g.  @xmath55 and @xmath60 , are correlated with the intrinsic particle size distributions of each batch .",
    "the combination of photoinduced magnetism and nanosized prussian blue analog particles with finite coercive fields is unique and establishes a length scale limit of @xmath57  nm for these properties .",
    "the next advances in the field will undoubtedly employ prussian blue analogs with higher transition temperatures @xcite that may have a variety of technical applications , including , for example , the exploitation of optically controlled magnetocaloric properties @xcite .",
