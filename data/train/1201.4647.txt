    "in 1968 , a couple stood to trial in a notorious case , known as ",
    "people of the state of california vs.  collins \" .",
    "the pair had been arrested since it matched eye - witness descriptions .",
    "it was estimated by the prosecution that only one in twelve million couples would match this description .",
    "the jury were invited to consider the probability that the accused pair were innocent and returned a verdict of guilty .",
    "later , the verdict was overthrown , essentially because of the flaws in the statistical reasoning .",
    "the case sparked interest in the abstraction of this problem , which became known as the island problem , following terminology introduced by eggleston @xcite .",
    "its formulation is the following .",
    "a crime has been committed by an unknown member of a population of @xmath5 individuals .",
    "it is known that the criminal has a certain property @xmath1 .",
    "each individual has @xmath1 ( independently ) with probability @xmath6 .",
    "a random member of the population is tested and observed to have @xmath1 .",
    "what is the probability that it is the criminal ?",
    "this problem has been quite extensively studied in the literature .",
    "for example , balding and donnelly @xcite give a detailed account of the island problem as well as of its generalization to inhomogeneous populations or ( alternatively ) uncertainty about @xmath6 .",
    "they also discuss the effects of a database search or a sequential search ( i.e. , a search which stops when the first @xmath1-bearer is found ) .",
    "dawid and mortera have studied the generalization of the island problem to the case where the evidence may be unreliable @xcite .",
    "the current paper is expository in the sense that some of the above mentioned results are reproduced - albeit presented in a somewhat different way - and a research article in the sense that we consider generalizations which to our knowledge have not appeared elsewhere .",
    "apart from the expository versus research nature , there is another duality in this paper , namely the distinction between the purely mathematical view versus a more applied viewpoint , and we elaborate on this issue first .",
    "most texts focus on the  likelihood ratio \" , the quantity that transforms  prior \" odds of guilt , that is , before seeing the evidence , into  posterior \" odds after seeing the evidence .",
    "there is good reason to do so .",
    "indeed , the likelihood ratio is often viewed as the weight of the evidence - it is therefore the quantity of interest for a forensic lab , which is unable or not allowed to compute prior ( or posterior , for that matter ) odds , this being the domain of the court .",
    "however , this already implies a first question .",
    "which part of the available data should be seen as the evidence , and which part is  just \" background information ? in other words : which evidence do we consider and what is the context ? indeed , the weight of the evidence , that is , the value of the likelihood ratio , sometimes depends on which of the available information is regarded as background information or as evidence ( and of course also on the propositions that one is interested in proving ) . from a purely mathematical point of view , concentrating on theposterior probabilities \" , that is , the probability that a suspect is guilty , given background information and/or evidence , settles the issue .",
    "indeed , it is well known ( @xcite ) that the posterior probabilities are invariant under different choices of the hypotheses as long as they are  conditionally equivalent given the data \" .",
    "hence , from a purely mathematical point of view , the situation is quite clear , and one should concentrate on the posterior probabilities rather than on the likelihood ratios .",
    "however , from a legal perspective things are not so simple .",
    "the likelihood ratio is , as mentioned earlier , supposed to be in the domain of the statistical expert , but what if this likelihood ratio involves prior probabilities itself ?",
    "we will see concrete examples of this in this article , and in these cases the classical point of view ( likelihood ratio is for the expert , the rest is for the court ) does not seem to immediately apply . if we have the choice among various likelihood ratios , are there reasons to prefer one over the other ? also this question will be addressed in particular cases in this paper .    for the island problem ,",
    "the above discussion is relevant as soon as the population has subpopulations , each with their own @xmath1-frequency . in that case , considering the information that the criminal has @xmath1 as information on the one hand or as evidence on the other , leads to different likelihood ratios , but the posterior odds are ( of course ) the same .",
    "we will go into this phenomenon in detail , considering subpopulations simultaneously with uncertainty about to which subpopulation the criminal and the suspect belong , together with uncertainty about the @xmath1-frequencies in each of the subpopulations .",
    "another possibility which we will consider is that of @xmath1-correlation or a biased search ( i.e. , the choice of suspect depends on the true identity of the criminal ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the classical island problem .",
    "we then consider in section 3 the effect of having a biased search protocol , and of having @xmath1-correlations ; we show that these two different types of having dependencies are strongly related to each other . in section 4 , we treat the case where the population is a disjoint union of subpopulations , each with their own @xmath1-frequency and prior probability of having issued the criminal . in section 5",
    ", we consider the effect of uncertainty of the @xmath1-frequencies , both in a homogeneous and heterogeneous population .",
    "in addition , we investigate the effect on the likelihood ratio of uncertainty about the criminal s and the suspect s subpopulations .",
    "section 6 deals with the case in which a suspect is found through a match in a database .",
    "finally , in section 7 we present a significant number of numerical examples .",
    "we have tried to include all details of the computations , but at the same time to state our conclusions in a non - technical and accessible way .",
    "our main conclusions can be recognized in the text as bulleted ( @xmath7 ) lists . as such",
    ", we hope that our contribution is interesting and useful both for mathematicians , forensic scientists and legal representatives .",
    "our starting point is a collection @xmath8 of @xmath5 individuals .",
    "all forthcoming random variables are defined on a ( non - specified ) probability space with probability measure @xmath9 .",
    "the random variables @xmath2 and @xmath0 take values in @xmath8 and represent the criminal and the suspect respectively .",
    "furthermore , we have a characteristic @xmath1 , for which we introduce indicator random variables @xmath10 , taking value 1 if @xmath11 has the characteristic @xmath1 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the @xmath10 are independent of @xmath12 in the sense that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "the number of @xmath1-bearers is written as @xmath15 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the conditional probability @xmath16 often we follow the habit of stating the so - called _ posterior odds _ in favour of guilt , that is , @xmath17 since we will often be working conditional on @xmath18 we introduce the notation @xmath19 we define the events @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". we will sometimes refer to the event @xmath25 ( or similar events ) as  information \" , and to @xmath26 ( or similar events ) as  evidence \" ; this is just colloquial use of language , and sometimes we will view @xmath25 as part of the evidence",
    ".    with this notation , reads @xmath27 which can be rewritten in two different ways , namely @xmath28 or @xmath29 the left hand side of these equations is called the",
    "_ posterior odds_. in ( [ target2 ] ) , we arrive at the posterior odds by  starting out \" with background information @xmath25 via the quotient @xmath30 called the _",
    "prior odds_. these prior odds are transformed into the posterior odds by multiplication with @xmath31 .",
    "this latter quotient is called the _ likelihood ratio _ and is supposed to be a measure of the strength of the evidence @xmath26 . on the other hand , in ( [ jawel1 ] ) we  start out \" from prior odds @xmath32 , that is , we interpreted both @xmath25 and @xmath26 as evidence .",
    "the likelihood ratio in that case is @xmath33 and measures the  combined \" strength of the evidence @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in this section treating the classical case , we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath0 are independent and that @xmath2 is uniformly distributed on @xmath8 . furthermore , the @xmath10 are independent and identically bernoulli distributed with success probability @xmath6 .",
    "these assumptions are not without problems when applied to concrete legal cases .",
    "the assumption that @xmath2 is uniformly distributed means that we a priori regard each member of the population equally likely to be the criminal .",
    "it is probably the case that computations based on this assumption can not be used as legal evidence .",
    "however , many of the computations below can also be done with other choices for the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "having a particular choice in mind does allow us to compare various formulas in a meaningful way .",
    "the independence and equidistribution of the @xmath10 will be relaxed later on in this paper , in various ways : one can consider subpopulations with different frequencies , allow dependencies between the @xmath10 or incorporate uncertainty in the probability @xmath6",
    ". also the independence between @xmath2 and @xmath0 will be relaxed later on .",
    "the outcomes in the current section do not depend on the particular @xmath34 we condition on , but for the sake of consistency , we do write @xmath35 instead of @xmath9 . we abbreviate @xmath36 .",
    "the independence between @xmath0 and @xmath2 now implies that @xmath37 .",
    "both likelihood ratios in ( [ target2 ] ) and ( [ jawel1 ] ) are equal to @xmath38 .",
    "it easily follows that @xmath39 in this case it does not really matter which viewpoint one takes : the likelihood is a function of @xmath6 alone , and does not involve any prior knowledge .",
    "of course , as mentioned before , in a legal setting it is not clear that uniform priors are acceptable or useful , and starting from other prior probabilities is of course possible in this framework .    in the next two subsections we will examine ( for the classical case ) how @xmath40 is related to the random variable @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that we may express @xmath42 both as the inverse of the expectation of @xmath41 and as the expectation of the inverse of @xmath41 , as long as we condition correctly .",
    "before anyone is tested for @xmath1 , @xmath41 has a @xmath43-distribution . when the crime is committed and it is observed that the criminal has @xmath1 , we condition on @xmath44 and obtain @xmath45 it follows that the probability that @xmath46 , given @xmath25 , is equal to the probability that a random variable with a @xmath47-distribution takes value @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 is distributed as @xmath50 .",
    "hence , writing @xmath51 for expectation with respect to @xmath35 , we have @xmath52 thus , the posterior probability of guilt is given by the inverse of the expected number of @xmath1-bearers , where this expectation takes into account that there is a specific individual - the criminal - who has @xmath1 : @xmath53 intuitively this makes sense : the criminal is a @xmath1-bearer , any one of the @xmath1-bearers is equally likely to be the criminal , and we have found one of them .",
    "so we have to compute the expected number of @xmath1-bearers , given the knowledge that @xmath2 is one of them .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath49 is distributed as @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , one expects @xmath54 bearers of @xmath1 .",
    "if we in addition also condition on @xmath55 , we compute @xmath56 we use this calculation to obtain : @xmath57 summarizing , @xmath58 so @xmath42 is in fact also equal to the expectation of @xmath59 , however , not of @xmath49 but of @xmath60 .",
    "this can be understood in an intuitive way : both @xmath0 and @xmath2 have @xmath1 , they have been sampled with replacement , so the probability that they are equal is the inverse of the number of @xmath1-bearers .",
    "this number is unknown , so we have to take expectations , given knowledge of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "when we compare this explanation with the one of , we see the importance of careful conditioning .",
    "so far , @xmath0 and @xmath61 were supposed to be independent of each other . in this subsection",
    ", we consider a different situation .",
    "the random variable @xmath2 representing the criminal is still supposed to be uniformly distributed , but the definition of @xmath0 is different : we repeatedly select from @xmath8 - with or without replacement - until a @xmath1-bearer is found , without keeping any records on the search itself , such as its duration .",
    "the @xmath1-bearer found this way is denoted by @xmath0 ; if there is no @xmath1-bearer in the population , we set @xmath62 , and define @xmath63 .",
    "as before we write @xmath64 and note that in this situation @xmath65 .",
    "as above , we are interested in @xmath66 which , since @xmath65 , reduces to @xmath67 , and this conditional probability is easy to compute : @xmath68 this formula was published by yellin in @xcite as the solution to this version of the island problem with a search .",
    "sometimes , however , it is incorrectly quoted in the literature ( e.g. in @xcite ) as an incorrect solution to the island problem without search as we have discussed it .      *",
    "the classical version of the island problem is not difficult to solve , but the relation between the probability of guilt and the expected number of @xmath1-bearers is rather subtle .",
    "the basic formula is @xmath69 * in the case of a search we have @xmath65 and this leads to @xmath70 these outcomes are independent of @xmath34 . * for the value of the likelihood ratio , it does not matter whether or not one interprets @xmath25 as background information or as evidence - in both cases the value is @xmath38 and this quantity does not depend on any prior knowledge . * the prior odds , the likelihood ratio and ( hence ) the posterior odds are all independent of @xmath34 .",
    "in this section we relax the condition that the @xmath10 are independent random variables or that @xmath0 and @xmath2 are independent . to this end , we define    @xmath71",
    "@xmath72      first we assume that the @xmath10 are independent ( not necessarily identically distributed ) random variables , but @xmath2 and @xmath0 are not .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in a biased search situation .",
    "it also accounts for selection effects , where certain members of the population are more likely to become a suspect than others .",
    "we write @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "now becomes @xmath75    in this last expression , the first term @xmath76 is the likelihood ratio in case of a search such that @xmath77 for all @xmath78 , i.e. , such that the probability of selecting @xmath34 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , this holds for a search where @xmath0 is uniformly random but other distributions of @xmath12 may also satisfy this criterion .",
    "the middle term in is the term that accounts for the bias of the search , i.e. , it expresses the effect of the dependence between @xmath0 and @xmath2 in the case @xmath79 .    the last term of is the `` prior odds '' , the odds in favour of @xmath80 , when @xmath25 is taken into account .",
    "it is of course also possible to start from `` prior odds '' @xmath81 ; this will yield the same posterior odds , but a different expression for the likelihood ratio .",
    "we will make this explicit for some special cases later on .",
    "we now assume again that @xmath0 and @xmath2 are independent , but we drop the assumption that the @xmath10 are independent . in that case , we can write @xmath82 since we have assumed that the @xmath83 are independent of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we have @xmath84 and we continue as @xmath85    as for the case of a biased search , the term @xmath76 is the likelihood ratio that we obtain in the case where the @xmath1-correlations do not play a role , i.e. , when @xmath86 for all @xmath78 .",
    "the middle term , analogously to , @xmath87 accounts for the @xmath1-correlations , and the last term @xmath88 describes the prior odds , conditional on @xmath89 .",
    "if we remove this conditioning , we get @xmath90    as for , the last line contains three terms : the likelihood ratio @xmath76 in the uncorrelated case , the term due to the correlation and the prior odds .",
    "finally , note that and imply @xmath91 ( or equivalently , the symmetry between the middle terms in and ): the way the correlation between the @xmath83 appear in the posterior odds depends on whether or not one considers @xmath89 to be evidence , or an event upon which everything is conditional .",
    "when we compare the posterior odds ( [ oddsbiased ] ) and ( [ res ] ) of the two situations , we see that the expressions are very similar .",
    "both have a correction factor in the denominator .",
    "in fact , when @xmath0 and @xmath2 are independent , then in @xmath35 can be replaced with @xmath9 , and the two cases reduce to each other if @xmath92 for all @xmath93 . a trivial example of this",
    "is obtained when @xmath2 is uniform on @xmath8 and the @xmath10 are independent bernoulli random variables . more generally ,",
    "every case of a biased search without @xmath1-correlations where the correlation coefficients between criminal and suspect are such that @xmath94 is equivalent ( as far as the probability of guilt is considered ) to a case where the search is unbiased but the @xmath10 are correlated with coefficients @xmath95 .",
    "in this section we consider the situation where the population consists of several subpopulations , each with their own @xmath1-frequency and each with their own probability of containing the criminal . to model",
    "this , we write @xmath8 as a disjoint union of subpopulations @xmath96 : @xmath97 with @xmath98 whenever @xmath99 . if @xmath100 , we say that @xmath101 is in subpopulation @xmath102 and write @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104 be the size of subpopulation @xmath96 .",
    "we write @xmath105 if @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath106 where the @xmath107 s are positive and satisfy @xmath108 .",
    "we assume that the random variables @xmath10 are independent bernoulli variables with probability of success @xmath109 ; hence they are not identically distributed as their distribution varies for different subpopulations .",
    "it follows from the above that we have @xmath110 for all @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , it follows from and that @xmath112    we can work this out in more detail in the case where @xmath0 and @xmath2 are independent and @xmath2 is uniform on subpopulations : @xmath113 this assumption is not a restriction , since we assume that all @xmath114 are independent .",
    "it is always possible to split up the population into parts such that the @xmath10 are i.i.d . on the parts and holds ( a trivial decomposition would be into singletons ) .",
    "first , we define @xmath115 to be the probability that @xmath116 , given that @xmath2 has @xmath1 : @xmath117 now , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and can be rewritten as @xmath120      it follows from that , whether @xmath0 and @xmath2 are independent or not , the likelihood ratio conditioned on @xmath25 is given by @xmath121 if we assume independence of @xmath0 and @xmath2 and that @xmath2 restricted to each subpopulation is uniform , then we obtain @xmath122 we note two special cases .",
    "first , when @xmath123 is large which means that the prior probability of guilt for @xmath34 is small ) , ( [ lr2 ] ) is approximately equal to @xmath124 in which the subpopulation to which @xmath34 belongs plays no special role .",
    "a second special case arises when we take @xmath125 , and only one other subpopulation .",
    "this is the standard practice for many forensic labs : there is a default population ( the local population ) , and only two hypotheses are considered : either @xmath3 , or @xmath2 is from the default population . in that case , the likelihood ratio is equal to @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the @xmath1-frequency in the default population and @xmath128 , the prior probability that @xmath2 is from the default population , is equal to @xmath129 .",
    "it seems that ( at least ) two likelihood ratios can be used to answer the informal question  what is the weight of the evidence that the suspect has the same characteristic as the criminal ? \" .",
    "contrary to the classical case described in section [ classical ] , the weight of the evidence depends on whether or not we consider the fact that the criminal has @xmath1 to be evidence or background information .",
    "depending on that choice and on the prior odds on guilt for @xmath0 , we may arrive at the reciprocal of either @xmath130 , @xmath127 , or@xmath131 .",
    "these quantities may be very different .",
    "this articulates the fact that one should be very careful with the use of such likelihood ratios , and that one should primarily be interested in posterior odds rather than in likelihood ratios .",
    "a similar warning in a different situation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one wants to divide the ingredients in the computation of the posterior odds into parts that are for the court to decide , and parts that are for an expert witness to provide , one faces difficulties .",
    "we will now go into these in some detail .",
    "the difference between the choice of conditioning on @xmath25 or not , is directly related to the difference between the questions  what is the probability that @xmath0 has @xmath1 , if innocent ? \" and  what is the probability that @xmath2 has @xmath1 , if @xmath0 is innocent ? \" ; or more informally  how else can we explain that @xmath0 has @xmath1 ? \" versus ",
    "how else can we explain that @xmath2 has @xmath1 ?",
    "\" indeed , if we consider both @xmath25 and @xmath26 as evidence to be expressed by a single likelihood ratio , then we can first consider @xmath26 , and then @xmath25 given @xmath26 .",
    "but without knowledge of @xmath25 , the probability that @xmath0 has @xmath1 is the same under @xmath132 as under @xmath133 , so the likelihood ratio of @xmath25 and @xmath26 together is in fact the same as the likelihood ratio of @xmath25 , given @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the issue here is that we need to decide if the fact that @xmath2 has @xmath1 counts as evidence against @xmath0 , or not .",
    "should the fact that @xmath2 has a certain characteristic count as ( legal ) evidence against someone , because he belongs to a subpopulation in which the characteristic is more common ? or do we only consider the fact that @xmath0 has the characteristic , _ knowing _ that @xmath2 has it , as evidence ?",
    "it seems unlikely that an answer can be given in full generality , but it is important to realize that the value of the evidence will depend on it .",
    "legal systems generally wish to make a distinction between the strength of the evidence , and the strength of the case .",
    "ideally , the expert witness informs the court about the strength of the evidence ( i.e. , gives a likelihood ratio ) , and the court combines this information with its prior to draw conclusions about the strength of the case .",
    "the prior is not discussed with , or communicated to , the expert .",
    "hence , for this to be possible , the likelihood ratio should not depend on the prior of the court .",
    "looking at however , it is apparent that this likelihood ratio does depend on the prior probabilities @xmath107 and on the suspect s population size @xmath123 .",
    "the value of the legal evidence , if taken to be both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , thus is a function of the prior and seems as such to be generally not admissible in court . in the special case ,",
    "however , it is ; but in that case we only obtain useful information if the assumption that either @xmath3 , or @xmath2 is from the default population , is justified .    the likelihood ratio does not suffer from these problems : it is a function of the suspect s subpopulation only , irrespective of any prior , on @xmath0 or on any other person or group .",
    "thus , if a court has somehow arrived at a prior probability @xmath134 , it can use the expert s information @xmath130 to proceed .",
    "but it must now be made clear to the court that there is a distinction between the priors with or without @xmath25 taken into account , and that to compute one from the other it also needs expert information .",
    "we end this discussion by pointing out some pro s and cons of the likelihood ratios and .",
    "clearly , only involves the suspect .",
    "this is a conceptually satisfactory property , since it allows for a clear distinction between prior probabilities and the value of the evidence , as we have pointed out above .",
    "it may also provide a safeguard against using irrelevant information as evidence .",
    "consider , for example , the following hypothetical scenario : at a crime scene , a hair of @xmath2 is found .",
    "analysis by a forensic hair expert shows that @xmath2 must belong to subpopulation @xmath135 .",
    "later , a suspect @xmath136 is found . from the hair a mitochondrial dna profile is generated , and @xmath0 s mitochondrial dna profile matches with it .",
    "the court wishes to be informed about the value of that match .",
    "clearly , it only makes sense to report @xmath130 , since it is at this point already known that @xmath0 and @xmath2 are from the same subpopulation . but the dna expert may not know this , and if it is standard procedure to report a variant of , e.g.  , then a profile frequency for the default , or even the world s population , could be reported .",
    "on the other hand , an advantage of is that it reduces the value of the evidence if there is a plausible alternative to @xmath0 for @xmath2 : if there are other groups in which @xmath1 is relatively frequent , and which have a positive prior probability , then decreases whereas does not .",
    "but as we have seen , can only do this because it makes use of all the prior probabilities , and as such it is likely to be inadmissible as legal evidence , especially if the court leaves the choice of prior to the expert .",
    "a possible way out would be for the expert to report all the @xmath137 separately to the court .    of course",
    ", in practice @xmath130 may be hard for the expert to determine , because he only has data about other populations , or because it is not immediately clear to which subpopulation @xmath0 belongs , or even what the subpopulations themselves are . in that case",
    ", it may be practical ( though potentially dangerous ) to use and report @xmath127 ( together with the hypotheses ! ) , if it is the only statistic concerning @xmath1 that the expert has knowledge of .",
    "the difference in numerical value of and may lead to the prosecution and defence having different preferences for the use of or ( a variant of ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath130 is much smaller than the weighted mean @xmath138 , the prosecution will prefer , but the defence will point out that in the population as a whole , there are subpopulations in which @xmath1 is much more common , and therefore try to persuade the court that better reflects the value of the match . the court should realize that both points of view can be justified : the prosecutor focuses on the suspect and comes up with the likelihood that @xmath0 has @xmath1 , if not guilty ; the defence focuses on @xmath2 and points out that @xmath0 need not be @xmath2 , since there are other good candidates . the court should realize that these arguments can be both valid .    to better understand the influence of uncertainty about the @xmath1-frequencies in the different populations and about the suspect s and the criminal s subpopulation , we proceed with a more detailed model involving these issues in section [ uncertainty ] .",
    "if we choose @xmath139 as we did in the classical case , then we can again express the posterior probability of guilt as the inverse of the expected number of @xmath1-bearers .",
    "we compute @xmath140 , and from it follows that @xmath141 which is the analogue of .",
    "the reader may check that similarly , @xmath142 this is the analogue of .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is uniformly distributed on @xmath8 , and suppose we do not condition on @xmath18 .",
    "concentrating on the conditional probability of @xmath132 we obtain @xmath143 the first term in the summation is computed above already , so we need only to compute @xmath144 .",
    "since information about @xmath0 and its @xmath1-status does not say anything about @xmath145 , we have that @xmath146 hence it follows that @xmath147 where @xmath148 hence the posterior probability of guilt is a weighted average of the conditioned ones , with weights @xmath130 .",
    "* the probability of guilt in this situation is equal to @xmath149 and this answer depends on @xmath34 via the frequency of @xmath1 in the subpopulation of @xmath34 , the distribution of @xmath2 and the size of the subpopulation of @xmath34 .",
    "the sizes of the other subpopulations do not play a role other than in the assessment of the @xmath107 and thereby of the @xmath115 , i.e. , in the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "* for the value of the likelihood ratio , it does matter whether or not @xmath25 is interpreted as background information or evidence . for the probability of guilt",
    "this distinction is - of course - irrelevant , but we have seen that there can be reasons to have preference for a particular choice . it is preferable to use a likelihood ratio which does not involve any prior knowledge .",

    "rather , presented with an individual @xmath101 such that @xmath296 , a court is interested in @xmath297 . therefore ,",
    "suppose as above that there are @xmath48 hits in the database , namely @xmath298 .",
    "a computation analogous to the above one shows that the posterior odds in favour of @xmath278 are @xmath299 notice that , if @xmath282 , we retrieve , as we should .      the most interesting case is when the database produces a unique hit . in that case , as we have seen , the posterior odds in favour of @xmath3 are given by . in this section",
    "we investigate a related , but different probability , namely the probability that if we have a unique database hit , that it is with the true culprit .",
    "this probability represents the long term effectiveness of the database in selecting the correct individual in the cases where it produces a unique match .",
    "we let @xmath281 denote the event that there is exactly one @xmath1-bearer in the database , and we will calculate @xmath300 where @xmath0 is the unique individual in the database with @xmath1 . to do so , we write @xmath301 first notice that gives @xmath302 and it remains to compute @xmath303 : @xmath304 where in the last step we used that @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",

    "however , this is not true in general , since @xmath314 may also depend on @xmath313 .",
    "it does , however , mean that enlarging a database does not necessarily improve its effectiveness , in the sense of increasing the odds on a unique match being with the true offender .",
    "for example , suppose that a database @xmath315 of size @xmath313 yields @xmath316 , and that a larger database @xmath317 of size @xmath318 yields @xmath319 . if @xmath320 then naturally @xmath321 , but the probability that @xmath3 given a unique match in @xmath317 is greater than the probability that @xmath3 given a unique match in @xmath315 only when @xmath322 this can be explained intuitively : if one adds many people who are unlikely to be @xmath2 to the database , then the probability of a chance match with one of these new individuals outweighs the fact that the probability that @xmath2 has been added to the database has increased in the sense that it becomes less likely that a unique match actually is a match with the criminal .",
    "hence the value of a unique match may increase or decrease with the size of the database , and it is not hard to see that the probability of a unique match itself may ( independently ) decrease or increase .      *",
    "if it is known with whom the match is , say with @xmath288 , then ( cf . ) the posterior probability of guilt is given by @xmath323 notice that this quantity only depends on @xmath324 , on the likelihood @xmath6 of a chance match with @xmath288 and on the a priori probability that the database contains the criminal .",
    "as the database increases , @xmath325 decreases but depending on @xmath326 the posterior probability @xmath327 may be greater or smaller than for a smaller database . * if it is not specified with which individual the match is , and the probability of having @xmath1 is @xmath6 for everyone in the database , then the posterior probability that the match is with the criminal is given by , cf .",
    ", @xmath328 these odds describe the long - term behaviour of the database , i.e. , the proportion in the long run of unique matches that are matches with the true criminal . naturally , enlarging the database always increases the probability that the criminal is contained in it .",
    "but the probability of a unique match may increase or decrease , and ( independently ) the value of a unique match may increase or decrease . in many cases , in an enlarged database the probability of a unique match increases , but the probability of a unique match being with the true offender decreases .",
    "in this section we illustrate the obtained results by considering some examples .",
    "we have chosen to cast most of these examples in a dna - setting , as this provides one of the few types of forensic evidence that are so well understood that more or less exact computations can be performed .",
    "the uncertainty surrounding dna - profile frequency estimates depends on the size of the database from which allele frequencies are estimated .",
    "a possible model is to define a prior distribution of allele frequencies , and to update this distribution with the database to obtain a posterior distribution .",
    "an often used approach is to use dirichlet distributions ( see @xcite for an account of the method and a discussion on the sensitivity for the choice of prior ) . doing this for a database containing alleles of 230 persons ( for many forensic labs the actual size of their database is a few hundred individuals )",
    ", it seems ( based on simulations for dna - profiles with six or seven loci and frequencies between @xmath329 and @xmath330 ) reasonable to use a standard deviation @xmath331 in the below examples .",
    "we start with the simple version of a homogeneous population @xmath8 of size @xmath5 and profile frequency @xmath6 . as we have seen ( cf .   and ) , the posterior probability of guilt is equal to @xmath332 . with @xmath333 , we get @xmath334 $ ] .",

    "the odds on @xmath2 belonging to @xmath135 are @xmath357 .",
    "if this is taken as information relative to which everything else is conditioned , then the likelihood ratio associated to having @xmath1 , is the inverse random match probability for the suspect : @xmath358 or @xmath359 .",
    "this gives rise to the same @xmath40 : if @xmath347 then the posterior odds are @xmath360 as above .",
    "similarly , for @xmath350 , we get posterior odds @xmath361 as above .",
    "when statements are made regarding the subpopulation to which @xmath2 belongs , one has to be careful to note whether or not @xmath25 has been taken into account . indeed taking @xmath115 equal to @xmath107 ,",
    "that is , @xmath362 , we overestimate posterior odds in favour of guilt with a factor 10 for suspects from @xmath135 and underestimate them with the same factor for suspects from @xmath342 .",
    "this is a serious overestimate of the actual odds for suspects from @xmath135 . in this example",

    "we recast the example given in section [ excorr ] in the setting of a biased search , to demonstrate the equivalence noted in section [ equiv ] . as in [ excorr ] ,",
    "@xmath381 for all @xmath11 , we suppose that @xmath79 has been selected and that @xmath382,and that there are @xmath393 such that @xmath394 for @xmath395 and @xmath396 for all @xmath102 .",
    "the prior odds are as in section [ excorr ] .",
    "then the likelihood ratio associated to the evidence @xmath382 is reduced by a factor of about 5000 , as in example [ excorr ] . in that example , the value was decreased since finding @xmath1 in @xmath34 made it more probable that population members @xmath397 , which have non - negligible prior probabilities of guilt , also have @xmath1 .",
    "in this situation , it is due to the fact that the selection procedure is such that if @xmath34 is selected , it becomes less likely that @xmath34 is guilty : @xmath398 which is considerably less than @xmath399 .",
    "the fact that @xmath34 has @xmath1 then raises the probability of guilt to approximately @xmath400 as above .      in",
    "we have computed the odds in favour of a unique database match being with the true criminal . if the database is a random sample of the population in the sense that @xmath401 , then this equation reads @xmath402 which is monotonically increasing in @xmath313 , going from @xmath403 for @xmath404 to infinity for @xmath405 .",
    "it is not hard to derive this directly : since @xmath406 persons have been shown not to possess @xmath1 , the population that can not be excluded has size @xmath407 . in that population ,",
    "only the @xmath1-status of one individual ( the one that matched in @xmath312 ) is known .",
    "since @xmath312 was a random sample as defined above , the classical solution applies .",
    "let @xmath408 and suppose that with @xmath409 one has @xmath410 .",
    "for example , this may be because the database consists of previously convicted individuals and based on the probability of a rightful conviction and of recidivism one arrives at such an estimate . for database @xmath312 , the odds that a unique match is with @xmath2 are 25 to one , or equivalently , @xmath411",
    ".    it may be possible to enlarge @xmath312 to @xmath412 with @xmath413 such that @xmath414 , but only at the cost of adding very many individuals into @xmath412 , e.g. with @xmath415 . in that case",
    ", the odds on a unique match being with the offender decrease to 5 , i.e. , one in six of such matches will be with an innocent person .",
    "the probability of actually obtaining a unique match is given by @xmath416for database @xmath312 , this evaluates to 0.206 and for database @xmath412 to 0.491% .",
    "thus , in @xmath412 a search with a dna - profile with population frequency @xmath330 will yield a unique match about half of the time , but only 5 out of 6 of these will be with the true offender .",
    "about 10% of such searches will result in two or more hits , and about 40% will not result in any hit .",
    "when multiple matches are found , it is more likely that one of them is with the true offender but not a near certainty : e.g. , in case two matches are found ( which happens with probability 0.09 ) , about one in ten of such double matches are both coincidental .    for the original database @xmath312 ,",
    "about 20,6% of searches result in a unique match , almost all of which are with the offender ; in the remaining cases one almost always has no hits : the probability of having more than one match being 0.002 .",
    "suppose that the database is set up and expanded such that if it has size @xmath313 then @xmath417 .",
    "this is a model for a database in which individuals with higher prior probability of guilt are put in the database with higher probability .",
    "for example , if @xmath312 contains the dna - profiles of 10% of the population , then it contains @xmath2 with probability 0.31 .",
    "if @xmath312 is enlarged to contain 30% of the population , then it contains @xmath2 with probability 0.55 .    in that case , the odds on a unique match being with the criminal in a database of size @xmath313 are minimal for @xmath418 .",
    "an example for @xmath419 is given in figure [ odds ] .",
    "with @xmath418 the odds in favour of a unique match being with the true offender are 20 . as the plots show , when the database is relatively small the odds on a match being with the true offender decrease rapidly , e.g. from 105 if @xmath420 to 55 if @xmath421 .",
    "as @xmath313 grows further , the odds decrease ( slowly ) to 20 for @xmath422 .",
    "when @xmath313 grows further , the odds increase again .",
    "when 50% of the population is included ( @xmath423 ) , they are 24 .      thus , enlarging a database may at the same time increase the chance of obtaining a unique match from it , and diminish the value of such a match in the sense that the probability of it being with the true offender decreases .",
    "these examples suggest that the idea that the larger the database , the better , needs to be put into perspective .",
    "it is of course true that enlarging a database increases the probability that the criminal is included .",
    "it is also obvious that given a unique match in the database , the probability that it is with the criminal increases when the database is expanded and does not yield additional matches . but as we have seen , it does not follow that hits in larger databases are stronger evidence for guilt than hits in smaller databases .",
