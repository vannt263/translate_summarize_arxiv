    "a function @xmath0 is said to be a _ wavelet _ if the system of functions @xmath1 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 mallat  @xcite and meyer  @xcite provided a framework to construct wavelets through the concept of multiresolution analysis ( mra ) .",
    "a sequence @xmath4 of closed subspaces of @xmath5 is called an mra if the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath6 for all @xmath7 , 2 .",

    "@xmath10 is dense in @xmath2 , 4 .",
    "@xmath11 , and 5 .",
    "there exists a function @xmath12 , called the _ scaling function _",
    ", such that @xmath13 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath14 .    one can always construct a wavelet from an mra ( see , for instance , ch .  2 in  @xcite ) , but",
    "not every wavelet can be obtained in this manner .",
    "the first example of a wavelet which can not be obtained from an mra was given by journ .",
    "in  @xcite we characterized a large class of wavelets , which also includes journ s wavelet , and proved that none of them is associated with an mra ( see theorem  [ thm : sn ] ) .",
    "the following theorem , which characterizes all wavelets of @xmath2 , was proved independently by gripenberg  @xcite and wang  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm : wavelet1 ] let @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath17 is a wavelet of @xmath5 if and only if @xmath18    we use the following definition of the fourier transform : @xmath19    if @xmath17 is a wavelet , then the support of @xmath20 must have measure at least @xmath21 .",
    "this minimal measure is achieved if and only if @xmath22 is the characteristic function of some measurable subset @xmath23 of @xmath24 .",
    "such a wavelet is called a minimally supported frequency ( msf ) wavelet and the associated set @xmath23 is called a _ wavelet set_. we refer to  @xcite for proofs of the above statements .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , a wavelet need not be associated with an mra , but it can be made to be associated with an mra - like structure in the following manner . given a wavelet @xmath17 we define the closed subspaces @xmath25 , @xmath7 , by @xmath26 it is easy to verify that these subspaces satisfy properties ( i)(iv ) of an mra .",
    "moreover , instead of ( v ) , the following weaker property holds :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 is invariant under translation by integers .",
    "a sequence of closed subspaces @xmath27 of @xmath2 which satisfies properties ( i)(iv ) and ( @xmath28 ) is called a generalized mra ( gmra ) .",
    "madych (  3 in  @xcite ) characterized all mras for which each @xmath29 is invariant under translation by all real numbers .",
    "let @xmath30 , @xmath31 , be the translation operator defined by @xmath32 .",
    "an mra @xmath27 is called a _ translation invariant _",
    "mra if @xmath33 for all @xmath7 and for all @xmath31 .",
    "madych proved that the only translation invariant mras are those for which the fourier transform of the scaling function is the characteristic function of a set .",
    "in other words , the associated wavelet is an msf wavelet .",
    "walter  @xcite modified the definition of translation invariance to include wavelets other than the msf wavelets .",
    "an mra is called _ weakly translation invariant _ if @xmath34 for @xmath7 and @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , every translation invariant mra is weakly translation invariant , since @xmath35 .",
    "walter gave necessary conditions for an mra to be weakly translation invariant .",
    "with an additional condition , these conditions also turned out to be sufficient for the weak translation invariance of mras associated with a class of meyer - type wavelets ( see  10.5 in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we see that the notion of translation invariance and weak translation invariance are applicable only to a limited class of wavelets .",
    "in this article we investigate the translation invariance from a slightly different point of view .",
    "we work in the more general set up of gmras in order to include _ all _ wavelets .",
    "we still demand the spaces @xmath25 to be invariant under translations , but only by dyadic rationals at a fixed level instead of translation by all reals .",
    "more precisely , we ask the following question :    let @xmath36 .",
    "does there exist a wavelet such that the space @xmath14 of the associated gmra is invariant under translation by elements of the form @xmath37 for all @xmath38 ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an affirmative answer to this question .",
    "we do this by explicitly constructing such wavelets for each @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 be the following groups of ( unitary ) translation operators : @xmath43 denote by @xmath44 the collection of all wavelets @xmath17 such that the space @xmath14 ( of the gmra @xmath45 associated with @xmath17 ) is invariant under the group @xmath46 . clearly , @xmath47 is the set of all wavelets , and @xmath48 these inclusions naturally defines an equivalence relation on the set of all wavelets .",
    "the equivalence classes are given by , @xmath41 , and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 , @xmath41 , is the class of wavelets such that @xmath51 is invariant under the group @xmath46 but not under @xmath52 .",
    "this equivalence relation was defined by weber in  @xcite and the equivalence classes were characterized in terms of the support of the fourier transform of the wavelets .    given a wavelet @xmath17 , let @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "in this notation , the characterization of @xmath50 , @xmath56 , as given in  @xcite , is the following .",
    "[ t.char ] ( a ) @xmath57 is precisely the collection of all msf wavelets .",
    "( b ) the equivalence class @xmath58 @xmath59 consists of all wavelets @xmath17 such that every element of @xmath60 is divisible by @xmath61 but there exists an element of @xmath60 not divisible by @xmath62 .",
    "( c ) a wavelet @xmath17 belongs to @xmath63 if and only if @xmath60 contains an odd integer .",
    "in the same paper , weber produced examples of wavelets belonging to the first few equivalence classes @xmath50 , namely for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this motivated us to construct wavelets for each @xmath50 .",
    "after we constructed these wavelets we came to know about the article  @xcite , in which schaffer and weber also constructed wavelets in @xmath66 , using the method of ` operator interpolation ' ( see chapter 5 in  @xcite ) .    in this paper we will construct wavelets belonging to each of these classes by a different method . our approach is simpler than that of  @xcite in the sense that for each integer @xmath67 , we construct a function @xmath68 such that @xmath68 has the required properties to be in @xmath69 as characterized in theorem  [ t.char ] .",
