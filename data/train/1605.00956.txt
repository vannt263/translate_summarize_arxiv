    ". the nuclear deformation manifests itself in many observable phenomena , including the small and large amplitude collective motions with the rotation and the fission as typical examples @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two kinds of ways to parametrize the nuclear shape @xcite .",

    "the other way is of one - center and to make a multipole expansion , @xmath4 ,   \\label{eq : surfacedeformation}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the deformation parameter .",
    "the way of multipole expansion is usually used in mean field calculations .",
    "several typical nuclear shapes are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ pic : shapes ] .",
    "most of the nuclei have shapes similar as a spheroid and such shapes are often described by @xmath6  an axial quadrupole deformation parameter .",
    "the nilsson perturbed - spheroid parameter @xmath7 @xcite was also often adopted for numerical convenience .",
    "it has been predicted for quite a long time that in some atomic nuclei , the non - axial quadrupole ( triaxial ) deformation @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 in the hill - wheeler coordinates ) plays an important role .",
    "a static triaxial shape manifests itself by the wobbling motion or chiral doublet bands ; both have been extensively studied from experimental and theoretical sides .",
    "the existence of multiple chiral doublet ( m@xmath10d ) bands in one nucleus was predicted by meng et al .",
    "@xcite and later multiple chiral doublet bands were observed .",
    "recently , collective hamiltonians have been proposed to study chiral and wobbling modes @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to construct similar hamiltonians ( the collective potential and mass parameters ) based on covariant density functionals . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bengtsson et al . proposed that one of the fingerprints of the triaxiality could be the low - spin signature inversion which has been also a hot topic in low energy nuclear structure studies .",
    "moreover , the termination of rotational bands is connected with the development of triaxial shapes in atomic nuclei @xcite and the triaxiality may also play a crucial role in superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the octupole shapes characterized by @xmath11 were predicted to be very pronounced in many nuclei , see ref .",

    "low - lying negative - parity levels , connected with the ground state bands via strong @xmath12 transitions , in actinides and some rare - earth nuclei are related to reflection asymmetric shapes with non - zero @xmath11 .",
    "the evidence for a strong octupole deformation has been shown in an experimental study of electric octupole transition strengths in @xmath13rn and @xmath14ra @xcite and in @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it was also revealed that the octupole deformation may explain the ra puzzle @xcite : the residual proton - neutron interactions for ra isotopes show an anomalous enhancement around @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "recently , liu et al . identified multiple chiral doublet bands in @xmath17br and observed octupole correlations between them @xcite .",
    "this raises an interesting topic on possible existence of nuclear chirality - parity quartet bands .",
    "the occurrence of the non - axial octupole @xmath18 deformation has also been investigated .",

    "nuclear deformations corresponding to higher - order terms with @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : surfacedeformation ] ) are important to different extents .",
    "the hexadecapole deformation , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , has been included in deformed mean field potentials since 1960s , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the effects of the @xmath22 or @xmath23 deformation on the alignment of angular momentum and dynamic moment of inertia @xmath24 in some superheavy nuclei were recently revealed @xcite .",
    "these various deformations are also very relevant to large amplitude nuclear collective motions , e.g. , the fission . since the nuclear fission is discovered @xcite , the description of the fission process has been a difficult and challenging task .",
    "the fission dynamics are mostly determined by the barriers which prohibit the dissolving of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "since the barrier penetration is involved in the fission process , both the height and the width of the fission barrier are very crucial in calculating fission probability @xcite .",
    "in particular , one of the forefronts of modern nuclear science is to explore the existence of charge and mass limits of atomic nuclei , i.e. , to study superheavy nuclei . in order to describe the synthesis mechanism of superheavy nuclei via heavy ion fusion reactions ,",
    "it becomes more desirable to have reliable descriptions for fission barriers for superheavy nuclei .",
    "until now many popular nuclear structure models have been employed to calculate nuclear fission barriers , including the macroscopic - microscopic model , the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral method @xcite , the non - relativistic mean field models ( hartree - fock or hartree - fock - bogoliubov method with the skyrme force   and the gogny force @xcite ) , and the covariant density functional theory .",
    "these models show similar trend of the barrier heights but the quantitative disagreement is rather large for some nuclei .",
    "the axial quadrupole deformation @xmath6 characterizes the elongation of a nucleus and is the most relevant shape for the nuclear fission . besides @xmath6 and @xmath20 which is connected with the neck formed during fission ,",
    "many other shapes are indispensable for studying properties of the fission barrier and for locating the static fission path .",
    "let us take actinides as examples .",
    "due to shell effects , a double - humped fission barrier appears in actinide nuclei @xcite .",
    "there may also appear a third minimum in the pes s of light actinide nuclei .",
    "in 1970s it was found in calculations with macroscopic - microscopic models that the height of inner fission barrier can be reduced by the triaxial distortion and that of the outer one can be lowered by the reflection asymmetric ( ra ) distortion @xcite .",
    "the importance of the triaxial and octupole distortions were later also confirmed both in non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite mean field calculations . from the above discussions ,",
    "it is clear that many deformations are crucial in the ground state , low - lying states , potential energy surfaces and fission properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "it is thus very desirable to develop self - consistent theoretical models in which as many deformations as possible are considered .",
    "this is especially true for studying atomic nuclei in unknown regions , including nuclei close to proton and neutron drip lines , superheavy nuclei , et al .    nowadays ,",
    "one of the most successful self - consistent approaches is the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) .",
    "the cdft has been used to describe both properties of ground states and excited states of nuclei in the whole nuclear chart ranging from light to superheavy regions , including pes s and fission barriers of heavy and superheavy nuclei . in the last years , we have developed multidimensionally - constrained covariant density functional theories ( mdc - cdfts ) in which the reflection symmetry and the axial symmetry are both broken @xcite . in mdc - cdfts ,",
    "all @xmath0 s with even @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 , are included self - consistently . in cdfts , either the meson exchange ( me ) or point - coupling ( pc ) interactions can be used .",
    "furthermore , the couplings can be non - linear ( nl ) or density - dependent ( dd ) .",
    "all these four types of relativistic density functionals , i.e. , nl - me , dd - me , nl - pc and dd - pc , were implemented in mdc - cdfts .",
    "the pairing correlations are treated with either the bogoliubov approach or the bcs method .",
    "the mdc - cdfts have been applied to the study of fission barriers and pes s of actinide and trans - actinide nuclei , the non - axial octupole @xmath2 effects in four @xmath3 isotones @xcite , the third minima and triple - humped barriers in light actinides @xcite and shapes of hypernuclei @xcite .",

    "the @xmath2 correlations originate from both protons and neutrons and such correlations are the most pronounced in @xmath194cf among these four nuclei .      * one of our motivations to develop the mdc - cdfts is to study shapes and pes s of superheavy nuclei .",
    "we are performing mdc - cdft calculations for superheavy nuclei with the axial and reflection symmetries simultaneously broken .",
    "* by constraining the shape to an extremely large deformation along a certain shape degrees of freedom , one may force some @xmath278-nuclei to be in a cluster configuration , such as the linear chain shape obtained by constraining @xmath279 @xcite , the tetrahedral shape by constraining @xmath18 , the bubble shape by constraining the radius , the toroidal shape by constraining @xmath280 , etc .",
    "the mdc - cdfts provide a useful tool for the study of such _ constraint cluster structure _ in atomic nuclei . * based on the mdc - cdfts with one or more hyperon(s ) included , we will study various shape effects in light and medium - heavy hypernuclei : ( 1 ) exotic shapes , e.g. , superdeformed and hyperdeformed states , the tetrahedron - like state , et al . ;",
    "( 2 ) the interplay between localization ( clustering ) effects and spontaneous symmetry breaking of nuclear shapes ; ( 3 ) the effects of hyperon on fission properties ; ( 4 ) the dependence of the shape polarization effect of hyperon and the persistence of superdeformed and hyperdeformed states on the effective interactions . * most of our investigations presented here have been performed for a limited number of nuclei and with only several selected effective interactions . nowadays",
    "systematic studies of the global performance of many relativistic functionals on the ground state properties and beyond - mean - field correlations of nuclei across the nuclear chart have been performed , see , e.g. , refs .",
    ". such global analysis of the performance of various functionals on nuclear shapes , potential energy surfaces and fission barriers will be also carried out by using the mdc - cdfts .",
