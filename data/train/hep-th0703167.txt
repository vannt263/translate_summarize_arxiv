    "ken wilson introduced the exact renormalization group ( erg ) to define continuum limits in quantum field theory.@xcite using a theory with a finite ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff , we can construct a continuum limit with the expense of keeping an infinite number of terms in the action .",
    "the idea was subsequently applied to perturbation theory by joe polchinski.@xcite the purpose of this paper is to apply polchinski s version of erg to construct qed perturbatively .    before writing anything about gauge theories",
    ", we would like to clarify our terminology .",
    "the `` action '' we have mentioned above is a functional of field variables .",
    "the momenta of the fields are restricted to the range below a uv cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "the interaction vertices of the action are obtained by integrating out the fluctuations of fields with momenta larger than @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the correlation functions calculated with this action contain the physics of all momentum scales .",
    "the action with a uv cutoff is often called a `` wilson action '' in the literature , and we will follow this practice here even though an `` action with a uv cutoff '' is perhaps more descriptive .",
    "the reason is that we wish to avoid confusion with the `` effective action '' with an infrared ( ir ) cutoff @xmath0 that consists of the 1pi parts of the vertices of the wilson action . in the limit @xmath1 , the `` effective action '' with an ir cutoff reduces to the standard effective action .",
    "erg determines the uv cutoff dependence of the wilson action or the ir cutoff dependence of the `` effective action '' . except for this introduction",
    ", we will consider only the wilson action in this paper .",
    "the construction of gauge theories in the framework of erg has been discussed by various authors . to the author",
    "s knowledge the first person who applied erg systematically to construct ( non - abelian ) gauge theories is becchi.@xcite ( there is an even earlier work by warr @xcite , who treated erg mainly as a method of regularization . )",
    "becchi showed how to construct a brst invariant wilson action by introducing sources that generate brst transformations .",
    "alternatively gauge theories can be formulated for the effective action with an ir cutoff .",
    "this was initiated by ellwanger @xcite under the name of the `` modified '' ward ( or slavnov - taylor ) identities .    whether we study a wilson action with a uv cutoff or an effective action with an ir cutoff , the form of the ward identities depends on the cutoff @xmath0 explicitly .",
    "( this is the reason for the adjective `` modified . '' ) but erg guarantees the @xmath0 independence of the identities : once the identities are satisfied for some @xmath0 , it is satisfied for any @xmath0 .",
    "it is this property which simplifies the study of gauge symmetry within the erg framework .",
    "the first explicit construction of qed using erg was done in @xcite .",
    "they computed the effective action with @xmath2 by solving erg differential equations starting from a set of initial conditions at a very large cutoff @xmath3 .",
    "they showed how to fine tune the initial conditions so that the effective action with @xmath2 satisfies the ward identities .",
    "there , erg is merely a device for loop calculations , and they did not take advantage of the simplicity of the ward identities at large @xmath0 . except for the original work of becchi , most later works seem to share the same short - coming : the ward identities are always checked at @xmath2 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to construct the wilson action of qed by satisfying the ward identities at large uv cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "as advocated by becchi @xcite , the ward identities get simplified at large @xmath0 , and to take advantage of this we need to parameterize the wilson action in terms of its asymptotic behavior at large @xmath0 . such parameterization scheme has been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we apply it here to qed .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we briefly review polchinski s erg differential equation by applying it to qed . in sect .",
    "3 we parameterize the wilson action in terms of its behaviors at large cutoff .",
    "this is an application of the scheme explained in @xcite .",
    "( the reader unfamiliar with perturbative applications of erg may find a casual reading of @xcite helpful . ) in sects .  4 and 5 we give a new derivation of the ward identities for the wilson action .",
    "the result we obtain is equivalent to what has been derived before by becchi @xcite and ellwanger @xcite and others for ym theories .",
    "our starting point is the ward identities in the continuum limit of qed .",
    "a crucial observation , which has not been emphasized or clearly understood in the previous literature on erg , is that the continuum limit can be constructed using a wilson action with any finite uv cutoff .",
    "( this is derived for the real scalar theory in appendix a. ) hence , we can rewrite the ward identities in the continuum limit as the identities for the wilson action .",
    "we will end up with an operator equation ( [ i d ] ) , an equality between two composite operators . in sect .",
    "6 , we explain how we can satisfy ( [ i d ] ) by fine tuning the parameters of the theory order by order in loop expansions .",
    "we give 1-loop calculations in sect .",
    "7 . after giving brief remarks about how to rewrite the ward identity ( [ i d ] ) as brst invariance in sect .  8",
    ", we conclude the paper in sect .",
    "some detailed calculations are given in appendix b.    before closing we mention some relevant past works . besides @xcite ,",
    "construction of qed using erg has been done by others , and we mention only a couple here . in @xcite the background field method was applied to scalar qed .",
    "more recently , a manifestly gauge invariant formulation has been constructed not only for qed @xcite but also for general ym theories.@xcite    throughout the paper we use the euclidean metric .",
    "the wilson action of qed is given as the sum of free and interaction parts : @xmath4 where @xmath5 we use a sign convention so that the weight of functional integration is given by @xmath6 $ ] instead of the more usual @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the momentum cutoff @xmath0 is introduced via a positive cutoff function @xmath8 , which is @xmath9 for @xmath10 and decays rapidly ( e.g. , exponentially ) for @xmath11 .",
    "the free propagators are given by @xmath12 throughout the paper we consider only the connected part of the correlation functions . for notational simplicity",
    "we omit the overall factor of the delta function for momentum conservation .",
    "we can construct the continuum limit using a wilson action @xmath13 with a finite @xmath0 .",
    "but this comes with a price : we must keep an increasing number of terms in the wilson action as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the interaction part @xmath14 is given by polchinski s erg differential equation @xcite : @xmath15 \\label{joe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a non - negative function which is zero for @xmath17 , has an appreciative value only for @xmath18 , and decays rapidly as @xmath19 grows .",
    "the minus sign in front of the second integral of ( [ joe ] ) is due to the fermi statistics .",
    "it is common to think that @xmath13 describes only the physics of low momentum @xmath20 correctly . on a close inspection , however , we find that @xmath13 contains the physics of all momentum scales .",
    "to be precise , the renormalized two - point functions are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the correlation function calculated with @xmath23 .",
    "the renormalized higher point functions are more simply given by @xmath24 to make sense of the division by @xmath25 , we assume that @xmath26 is strictly positive and that it vanishes only in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "as long as the wilson action @xmath13 satisfies ( [ joe ] ) , the right - hand sides of ( [ aa],[psipsibar],[higher ] ) are independent of the cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "since the results ( [ aa],[psipsibar],[higher ] ) may not be widely known , we derive analogous results for the real scalar field theory in appendix a.",
    "let us next discuss how to parameterize the solutions of ( [ joe ] ) .",
    "we are only interested in those solutions corresponding to renormalized theories .",
    "( see @xcite for a similar analysis for the @xmath28 theory . )",
    "we evaluate the functional derivatives of @xmath13 at vanishing fields .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors at large @xmath0 are obtained by expansions in powers of the electron mass and external momenta : @xmath29 where an arbitrary momentum scale @xmath30 is introduced to make @xmath31 dimensionless .",
    "the vertical line with subscript @xmath32 is a reminder that the derivative is evaluated at vanishing fields .",
    "( the extraction of the asymptotic parts is similar to the @xmath33 operation in @xcite . )    for the renormalizable theories , the dotted parts are suppressed by negative powers of @xmath0 , hence vanishing in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "the higher order derivatives have negative dimensions , and vanish also in the limit @xmath34 .    in solving ( [ joe ] ) , the seven functions @xmath35 are ambiguous by additive constants .",
    "( note that the quadratically divergent @xmath36 has no such ambiguity . ) therefore , in order to specify a unique solution of ( [ joe ] ) , we must introduce seven conditions .",
    "to begin , we can adopt the following three normalization conditions : @xmath37 ( @xmath38 normalizes the gauge field , @xmath39 the spinor fields , and @xmath40 the mass parameter @xmath41 . )",
    "it is one of the main purposes of this paper to show how the ward identities determine the remaining four constants @xmath42 in terms of the elementary charge @xmath43 , which itself is introduced through the ward identities .",
    "let us recall the renormalized ward identities in qed .",
    "they have two parts .",
    "the first part is the identity for the two - point function of the gauge field : @xmath44 the second part is the ward identities for the higher - point functions : @xmath45 \\label{ward-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is interpreted as the elementary charge defined at scale @xmath46 .",
    "the ward identities can be also written as the conservation law : @xmath47 \\label{cvc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the charge current .",
    "the goal of this section is to find a concrete expression of @xmath48 in terms of the interaction action @xmath14 .",
    "we first examine ( [ ward-1 ] ) . using ( [ aa ] ) ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ ward-1 ] ) as @xmath49 since @xmath50 ( see appendix a for an analogous result for the real scalar theory ) , we can rewrite ( [ ward-1a ] ) as @xmath51    next , we examine ( [ ward-2 ] ) . using ( [ higher ] ) and @xmath52 ( again see appendix a )",
    ", we can rewrite ( [ ward-2 ] ) as @xmath53\\label{ward}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to summarize so far , we can replace ( [ ward-1],[ward-2 ] ) by ( [ ward0],[ward ] ) . note that ( [ ward0 ] ) is a special case @xmath54 , @xmath55 of ( [ ward ] ) .",
    "hence , ( [ ward ] ) for arbitrary @xmath56 is equivalent to ( [ ward-1],[ward-2 ] ) .",
    "we now define a vector current by @xmath57 this is a composite operator since its correlation functions @xmath58 are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "( see appendix a for an explanation on composite operators . ) to show this , we differentiate ( [ joe ] ) with respect to @xmath59 to obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a linear differential operator defined by @xmath62 acting on any functional @xmath63 . ( [ operator ] ) guarantees that the correlation functions ( [ jcorr ] ) are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , from ( [ ward][jcorr ] ) , we can rewrite the ward identities as ( [ cvc ] ) where @xmath48 is defined by ( [ jmu ] ) .",
    "( for a discussion of composite operators in @xmath28 theory , see @xcite . )",
    "in this section we wish to rewrite the ward identities ( [ cvc ] ) as a single operator equation . for this purpose",
    "we construct a composite operator @xmath64 whose correlation functions give the right - hand side of ( [ cvc ] ) : @xmath65 once we construct @xmath64 , the ward identities ( [ cvc ] ) are equivalent to the single operator equation : @xmath66 the construction of @xmath64 is essential , but it involves a fair amount of technicality . the derivation will be given in appendix b. there , we show that @xmath64 is given by @xmath67 \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath68 is defined by @xmath69 \\label{u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath70 is a composite operator , satisfying @xmath71 hence , if ( [ i d ] ) is valid asymptotically for large @xmath72 , then it is valid for any @xmath0 . as explained in sect .  1",
    ", this is the most important feature of the ward identity in erg .",
    "a ward identity similar to ( [ i d ] ) has been obtained for the scalar qed in equation ( 7 ) of @xcite , using the background field formalism .",
    "we now show how to satisfy the ward identity ( [ i d ] ) for @xmath73 by fixing the four constants ( [ four ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath74 is easily obtained from the asymptotic behavior of the wilson action , which is given by ( [ asymp - aa],[asymp - vertex],[asymp - aaaa ] ) : @xmath75    the composite operator @xmath64 is a dimension @xmath76 scalar operator of momentum @xmath77 , odd under charge conjugation , and vanishing at @xmath78 .",
    "hence , its asymptotic behavior has the same form as above : @xmath79 the values of the four dimensionless functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 at @xmath84 determine @xmath64 uniquely .",
    "therefore , the operator equation ( [ i d ] ) is equivalent to the following four equations : @xmath85 where we have used the convention @xmath86 .",
    "now , @xmath70 is defined by ( [ phi ] , [ u ] ) in terms of the wilson action @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath88 expanding the right - hand sides in powers of the electron mass and external momenta , we can obtain @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "on the right - hand sides one extra loop is given explicitly by the integral over @xmath89 , and it is sufficient to know @xmath90 only up to @xmath91-loop level to determine the four constants @xmath92 at @xmath93-loop level .",
    "( note @xmath94 by convention . ) in other words , with @xmath95 determined up to @xmath91-loop level , we can determine the @xmath93-loop values of @xmath96 by demanding ( [ recursion ] ) .",
    "we can thus construct qed using the ward identities .",
    "this recursive nature of the ward identities has been observed by becchi @xcite and morris and dattanasio @xcite among others .",
    "we have taken advantage of it using our particular parameterization of the theory .",
    "using the results of the previous section , let us do 1-loop calculations .",
    "we start from the tree - level values : @xmath97    at 1-loop , ( [ phi-1 ] ) gives @xmath98 changing the integration variable as @xmath99 we obtain @xmath100\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have expanded the integral in powers of @xmath101 and @xmath102 . using @xmath103 ( independent of the choice of @xmath104 ) , we obtain @xmath105    next we consider ( [ phi-2 ] ) at 1-loop : @xmath106 where we have used the change of variables ( [ change ] ) , and expanded the integral in powers of @xmath102 , @xmath107 .",
    "hence , @xmath108    finally , we consider ( [ phi-3 ] ) : @xmath109 hence , we obtain @xmath110",
    "to elucidate the gauge structure of qed further , we introduce ghost and antighost fields @xmath111 . these fields are non - interacting , and we define the total wilson action by @xmath112 we now define the brst transformation as follows : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an arbitrary grassmann variable . the transformation of @xmath115 is highly non - linear due to the second term . the ward identity ( [ i d ] ) is equivalent to the following brst invariance : @xmath116 the first term is the change of the wilson action @xmath117 under the transformation .",
    "the second term is the change of the fermionic integration measure .",
    "note that the non - vanishing @xmath118 implies the non - invariance of the action under the brst transformation .",
    "for example , the non - invariance due to the photon mass term is cancelled precisely by the jacobian .    due to the electron number conservation , the transformation of @xmath119 under brst is not unique .",
    "alternatively , we can define the brst transformation which is symmetric between @xmath115 and @xmath120 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 are composite operators .",
    "the transformations of @xmath123 are the same as before .",
    "the brst invariance is now given as @xmath124 = 0\\ ] ]    the first form of brst invariance has been extended further using the antifield formalism in the joint work with igarashi and itoh.@xcite",
    "for some time the compatibility of a smooth cutoff with gauge invariance has been established by the previous works ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite@xcite and references therein ) on erg .",
    "nevertheless , the contrary viewpoint is still prevalent among the practitioners of quantum field theory .",
    "a main task of this paper was to introduce a concrete application of erg to convince the reader of the compatibility .",
    "in particular we have shown how to construct qed using erg .",
    "the wilson action with a finite momentum cutoff has exactly the same gauge invariance as the continuum limit .",
    "nothing is compromised .",
    "the crucial observation for our construction is that with a wilson action we can compute the correlation functions in the continuum limit .",
    "( see ( [ aa][higher ] ) and appendix a. )    as we have mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , it is some time since the ground work was laid down for incorporation of gauge symmetries in the erg formalism . as far as formalism goes , becchi s results in @xcite are seminal , if not final .",
    "a merit of the present paper is in the use of a particular parameterization of the theory , based on the asymptotic behavior of the wilson action at a very large cutoff .",
    "the ward identities of the wilson action simplify for a large cutoff , and we were able to take advantage of it using our parameterization scheme . in a future publication",
