    "this is due to the fact that a pka moving along a high symmetry direction is highly likely to give rise to a near direct impact , potentially transporting a defect over a relatively large distance via rapid crowdion diffusion .",
    "thus , for a better summary of average behavior in these systems , it is most useful to look at only the results from our set of random pka directions .",

    "thus , for isotropic expansion and compression , small amounts of volume change ( less than 1@xmath0 ) lead to statistically insignificant changes in the number of defects generated .",

    "_ for tetragonal shear strain , it is shown that there is a minimal amount of variation in the number of defects generated as a function of applied strain , and thus the average behavior is not impacted by applied tetragonal shear strain .",
    "therefore , applied tetragonal shear strain exhibits the same behavior as uniaxial and monoclinic shear strains , in that the number of defects generated remains approximately constant as a function of applied strain .",
    "the results from isotropic expansion and compression investigations lead to the question of what causes the variance as a function of applied strain . due to the fact that the largest volume changes occurred in expansion / compression ,",
    "perhaps simply volumetric changes can be the driving force for increases or decreases in defect generation .",
    "to investigate this hypothesis , very large uniaxial strains were imposed to create volume changes approaching 2@xmath0 isotropic expansion and compression .",
    "the results of this investigation are shown in figure 4 , for uniaxial tension and compression up to 5@xmath0 and 4@xmath0 , respectively . in figure 4",
    ", it is shown that from 2@xmath0 compression to 2@xmath0 tension , there are negligible effects of applied strain on the number of defects generated .",
    "however , when the magnitude of the applied strain becomes more extreme , significant increases ( for tension ) and decreases ( for compression ) in the number of defects generated are observed .",
    "for 5@xmath0 applied tension , there is approximately a 40@xmath0 increase in the number of defects generated . for 4@xmath0 applied compression",
    ", there is approximately a 20@xmath0 decrease in the number of defects generated .",
    "thus , these results are comparable to the effects from isotropic expansion and compression shown in figure 3__a _ _ , when the applied uniaxial strains lead to comparable levels of volumetric expansion or compression",
    ". thus , substantial increases and decreases in volume can create significant effects on the number of defects generated from a cascade in bcc fe , whereas volume - conserving shear strains are not observed to create significant effects on the number of created defects .     applied tension and 4@xmath0 compression .",

    "error bars denote twice the standard error of the sample . ]",
    "with the observation that volume changes can affect the number of defects generated , the specific nature of how these effects take place is now investigated .",
    "specifically , we focus on how volume changes affect point defect formation energies , the peak number of defects generated in cascades as well as survival fractions .",
    "this work is also performed for volume conserving strains as a comparison in order to specifically determine the effects of volume altering strains on the radiation damage behavior of bcc fe .",
    "systems with one frenkel pair are investigated at 300 k in order to provide a direct comparison with the results on defect generation in strained systems above .",
    "no interstitial diffusion occurs during these simulations .",
    "frenkel pair formation energies are calculated from equation 1    @xmath4    where e@xmath5 is the energy of the system with a non - interacting interstitial / vacancy pair and e@xmath6 is the energy of the system with no defects .",
    "we note that in the simulations used to compute e@xmath5 no interstital diffusion occurred , such that the excess energy defined in equation 1 is that of a single frenkel defect .",
    "frenkel pair formation energies are displayed in figure 5 as a function of applied _ a _ hydrostatic , _ b _ uniaxial , _ c _ monoclinic shear and _ d _ tetragonal shear strains .",
    "sixteen unique simulations were performed for each applied strain ( eight without defects , eight with defects ) to gain statistics in these systems .",
    "error bars in figure 5 denote twice the standard error of the mean . in figure 5__a _ _ and _ b _ , we observe significant variance in the frenkel pair formation energy as a function of applied strain . as",
    "applied strain becomes more positive ( volume increases in the case of _ a _ and _ b _ ) , the frenkel pair formation energy decreases .",
    "thus , frenkel pair formation leads to a smaller energy change as volume increases .",
    "the converse is true for negative strain in figure 5__a _ _ and _ b _ , in that a volume decrease is associated with an increase in frenkel pair formation energy . for the volume - conserving strains in figure 5__c _ _ and _ d _ , no significant changes in the frenkel pair formation energy are observed with applied strain .",
    "all data points possess overlapping error bars with the unstrained system .        to determine what role the variations in frenkel pair formation energy directly play on the cascade behavior in bcc fe , the peak number of defects created in a cascade is determined and plotted in figure 6 as a function of applied hydrostatic , uniaxial , monoclinic shear and tetragonal shear strains .",
    "this data is taken from the simulations of random pka directions displayed in figure 3 . in figure 6__a _ _ and _ b _ , there is a direct correlation between an increase in the volume of the system and the peak number of defects created in a displacement cascade .",
    "for both hydrostatic and uniaxial strains , a near linear dependence is observed for the peak number of defects created in this system as a function of applied strain . for the volume - conserving shear strains in figure 6__c _ _ and _ d _ , no significant changes in the peak number of defects created in a displacement cascade are observed . from the peak number of defects in figure 6 and the stable number of defects from figure 3",
    ", we calculate survival fractions across all applied strains for all systems .",
    "all survival fractions for strained systems are within 1@xmath0 of the survival fraction for an unstrained system",
    ". therefore , applied strain produces no statistically significant variance in the defect survival fraction .",
    "the survival fraction for all applied strains is displayed in figure 7 .            from these results",
    ", we can state that variations in the volume of bcc fe create variations in the frenkel pair formation energy , with increases in volume yielding decreases in formation energy and increases / decreases in the volume yielding conditions where it is easier / more difficult to create frenkel pairs .",
    "thus , under irradiation , for a cascade of a given energy , systems with a lower frenkel pair formation energy will exhibit a higher maximum number of created defects .",
    "systems with a high frenkel pair energy will exhibit a lower maximum number of created defects . since volume changes produce no statistically significant changes on the survival fraction of point defects during a cascade , systems with a higher maximum number of defects created during a cascade will also exhibit a higher number of stable defects .",
    "this is consistent with prior investigations that show that the number of defects increases with increasing pka energy , even though the fraction of surviving defects decreases @xcite .",
    "volume - conserving strains and transformations yield no such variations in frenkel pair formation energy and thus no such variations in the stable number of defects created via cascades in bcc fe .",
    "this work suggests a direct link between formation energy and threshold displacement energy .",
    "this is reasonable , since at 0 k the displacement energy is a combination of the formation energy of a frenkel pair and the migration barrier to form this frenkel pair@xcite .",
    "thus , it can reasonably be expected that an increase in the frenkel pair formation energy can lead to an increase in the threshold displacement energy and a subsequent decrease in defect generation .    to verify this interpretation , a basic investigation was undertaken to analyze the effect of strain on the displacement energy .",
    "a bcc supercell containing 16,000 atoms is relaxed for 100 ps at 300 k in an npt ensemble .",
    "a strain is applied to the supercell and the strained lattice is allowed to relax for 100 ps in an nvt ensemble .",
    "an atom near the center of the supercell is then given extra kinetic energy , with the velocity directed in a prescribed direction .",
    "the pka direction analyzed is a single direction from the set of 32 randomly selected directions used in the previous simulations .",
    "the time step is set to 0.2 fs and the simulation is run for 30000 steps .",
    "we utilize the gjf thermostat and set the damping parameter to 1 ps .",
    "the existence of a stable frenkel pair is determined after 6 ps via a wigner - seitz cell based algorithm @xcite .",
    "a total of 64 independent simulations are performed on non - strained systems and 100 independent simulations are performed on strained systems in order to gain statistics .",
    "it is important to note that since only a single direction is investigated , the results do not represent the average displacement energy , but only the displacement energy in a given direction .",
    "although we focused on just one randomly selected direction , we believe the results suffice to establish the overall trend related to the effect of strain on displacement energy .    in figure 8 , the probability of frenkel pair formation as a function of pka energy is displayed .",
    "red squares denote the unstrained system and a dashed trend line is fit to this data .",
    "the blue diamonds denote the system with 2@xmath0 isotropic expansion and a solid trend line is fit to this data .",
    "a finely dashed horizontal line is overlaid at a probability of 0.5 .",
    "this is to illustrate that when the probability curve becomes greater than 0.5 , it is probable to form a frenkel pair from a given pka energy , and thus , this value of the pka energy is the displacement energy . from this data ,",
    "it is clear that with applied strain at a given pka energy , the probability of frenkel pair formation is greater .",
    "there is also a decrease in the displacement energy with applied strain of approximately 10 ev .",
    "this supports the previous interpretation in that applied strain affects the formation energy of frenkel pairs and in turn affects the displacement energy . in other words ,",
    "expansion of a system will result in a decrease in the displacement energy .     isotropic expansion .",
    "the energy at which the probability curve becomes greater than 0.5 is the displacement energy . ]",
    "in this study , molecular dynamics simulations were performed on pure bcc fe to investigate the effects of applied strain on the generation of radiation damage .",
    "the pka directions analyzed included [ 135 ] , [ 100 ] , [ 001 ] , [ 110 ] , and finally a set of 32 randomly selected directions with a pka energy of 5 kev at 300 k. it was found that volume - conserving tetragonal shear and monoclinic shear strains yield no statistically significant variations in the stable number of defects created via cascades in bcc fe . however , isotropic expansion or compression greater than 1@xmath0 or uniaxial strain greater than 2@xmath0 produces a statistically significant effect on defect generation .",
