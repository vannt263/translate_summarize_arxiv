    "chaos is one of the essential concepts to justify a statistical treatment of deterministic dynamical systems . in a chaotic system",
    "a small initial error diverges exponentially , as characterized quantitatively by the lyapunov exponents @xmath0 , and it means that it is impossible in principle to predict precisely any quantity of deterministic systems at any time and a statistical treatment of the systems is required .",
    "it is well known that even one - particle systems can be chaotic and have some of the important statistical properties of equilibrium statistical mechanics such as the mixing property , etc .",
    "for this reason many works on the subject of chaos have been done in one - particle systems , for example , billiard systems and lorentz gas models @xcite .",
    "however many - particle effects should still play an important role in some statistical aspects , such as the central limit theorem and a justification of thermodynamical reservoirs , etc .",
    "therefore it should be interesting to know what happens with the combination of a chaotic effect and a many - particle effect , in other words , to know which chaotic effects do not appear in one - particle systems .    the lyapunov spectrum is introduced as the sorted set @xmath1 of lyapunov exponents satisfying the condition @xmath2 , and",
    "is a quantity to characterize the many - particle chaotic dynamics . recently",
    "a stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectrum was reported numerically , as one of the many - particle chaotic effects , in many - disk systems in which each disk interacts with the other disks by hard - core interactions @xcite .",
    "this stepwise structure appears in the region of small absolute values of lyapunov exponents .",
    "this fact suggests that steps in the lyapunov spectra come from slow and macroscopic behavior of the system , because small positive lyapunov exponents should correspond to slow relaxation precesses .",
    "this point is partly supported by the existence of a global structure in the lyapunov vectors , the so called lyapunov modes , which are wavelike structures in the tangent space of each eigenvector of a degenerate lyapunov exponent , that is , for each stepwise structure @xcite .",
    "the wavelike structure of the lyapunov vectors appears as a function of the particle position , so this structure is also important as a relation to connect the tangent space with the phase space . although the lyapunov vectors have been the subject of some works more than a decade ago ( for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is remarkable that an observation of their global structure in fully chaotic many - particle systems has only recently appeared .",
    "explanations for the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra have been attempted using periodic orbit models @xcite and using the master equation approach @xcite .",
    "other approaches to the lyapunov modes have included using a random matrix approach for a one - dimensional model @xcite and using a kinetic theoretical approach @xcite , by considering these as the `` goldstone modes '' @xcite .",
    "if the stepwise structure of lyapunov spectra is a reflection of a global behavior of the system , then one may ask the question : does such a structure depend on boundary conditions which specify the global structure of the system ?",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to answer this question using some simple examples . in this paper",
    "we investigate numerically the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra in many - hard - disk systems of two - dimensional rectangular shape with the four kinds of the boundary conditions : [ _ a1 _ ] purely periodic boundary conditions , [ _ a2 _ ] periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath3-direction and hard - wall boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction , [ _ a3 _ ] hard - wall boundary conditions in the @xmath3-direction and periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction , and [ _ a4 _ ] purely hard - wall boundary conditions . in all cases we took the @xmath4-direction as the narrow direction of the rectangular shape of the system and @xmath3-direction as the longer orthogonal direction .",
    "the case [ _ a1 _ ] means that the global shape of the system is like the surface of a doughnut shape , the cases [ _ a2 _ ] and [ _ a3 _ ] means that the system has the shape of the surface of pipe with hard - walls in its ends .",
    "case [ _ a2 _ ] is a long pipe with small diameter while case [ _ a3 _ ] is a short pipe with a large diameter . the case [ _ a4 _ ] means that the system has just a rectangular shape surrounded by hard - walls . adopting hard - wall boundary conditions in a particular direction destroys the total momentum conservation in that direction , so by considering these models we can investigate the effects of the total momentum conservation on the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra and the lyapunov modes .",
    "this can be used to check some theoretical approaches to these phenomena like those in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the total momentum conservation plays an essential role in explaining the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra or the lyapunov modes .",
    "we obtain different stepwise structures of the lyapunov spectra with each different boundary condition case .",
    "especially , we observe a stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectrum even in the purely hard - wall boundary case [ _ a4 _ ] , in which the total momentum is not conserved in any direction .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to categorize the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra according to the wavelike structure of the lyapunov vectors .",
    "so far wavelike structure of the lyapunov vectors was reported in the lyapunov vector components as a function of positions , for example in the quantity @xmath5 as a function of the position @xmath6 ( the transverse lyapunov mode ) @xcite and in the quantity @xmath7 as a function of the position @xmath6 ( the longitudinal lyapunov mode ) @xcite , in which @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) is the @xmath4-component ( @xmath3-component ) of the spatial coordinate part of the lyapunov vector of the @xmath8-th particle corresponding to the @xmath9-th lyapunov exponent @xmath0 , and @xmath6 is the @xmath3-component of the spatial component of the @xmath8-th particle .",
    "these wavelike structures appear in the stepwise region of the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "however it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the sequence and the kinds of steps of the lyapunov spectrum and the modes of wavelike structure of the lyapunov vectors in the numerical studies , that is , how we can categorize the steps of the lyapunov spectrum by the lyapunov modes . in this paper",
    "we show another type of wavelike structure of the lyapunov vectors , which appears in the quantity @xmath10 with the @xmath4-component @xmath11 of the momentum coordinate of the @xmath8-th particle , and use this wavelike structure to categorize the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra . the lyapunov vector components @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath10 have a common feature in which each quantity gives a constant corresponding to one of the zero lyapunov exponents of the system with purely periodic boundary conditions , because of the conservation of center of mass or the deterministic nature of the orbit .",
    "more concretely in this paper we consider the two kinds of graphs : [ _ b1 _ ] the quantity @xmath5 as a function of the position @xmath6 , namely the transverse lyapunov mode , and [ _ b2 _ ] the quantity @xmath10 as a function of the position @xmath6 and time ( or collision number ) . in the two - dimensional rectangular systems consisting of many - hard - disks with periodic boundary conditions ( the boundary case [ _ a1 _ ] )",
    "it is known that there are two types of steps of the lyapunov spectra : steps consisting of two lyapunov exponents and steps consisting of four lyapunov exponents @xcite . the wavelike structure in the graph [ _ b1 _ ] corresponding to the two - point steps of the lyapunov spectrum for such a rectangular system is well known .",
    "in this paper we show the wavelike structure corresponding to the four - point steps of the lyapunov spectrum in the graph [ _ b2 _ ] . besides , we observe time - dependent oscillations in the graph [ _ b2 _ ] , whereas the graph [ _ b1 _ ] is rather stationary in time .",
    "the wavelike structure in the graph [ _ b2 _ ] also appears in the rectangular systems with a hard - wall boundary condition ( the boundary cases [ _ a2 _ ] , [ _ a3 _ ] and [ _ a4 _ ] ) , specifically even in the case of purely hard - wall boundary conditions in which the transverse lyapunov mode [ _ b1 _ ] does not appear . we show that the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra in the boundary cases [ _ a1 _ ] , [ _ a2 _ ] , [ _ a3 _ ] and [ _ a4 _ ] can be categorized by the wavelike structures of the graphs [ _ b1 _ ] and [ _ b2 _ ] .",
    "one of the problems which make it difficult to investigate the structure of the lyapunov spectra and the lyapunov modes is that the calculation of a full lyapunov spectra for many - particle system is a very time - consuming numerical calculation",
    ". therefore it should be important to know how we can calculate the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra and the lyapunov modes with as little calculation time as possible .",
    "it is known that a rectangular system has a wider stepwise region of the lyapunov spectrum than a square system @xcite .",
    "noting this point , in this paper we concentrate on the most strongly rectangular system , namely on the quasi - one - dimensional system in which the rectangle is too narrow to allow particles to exchange their positions .",
    "as will be shown in this paper , the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectrum for the quasi - one - dimensional system is the same as the fully rectangular system which allows exchange of particle positions and each particle can collide with any other particle , and the steps of the lyapunov spectra consist of two - point steps and four - point steps in the periodic boundary case [ _ a1 _ ] .",
    "we also determine an appropriate particle density to give clearest stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectrum in the quasi - one - dimensional system .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ quasionedime ] we discuss how we can get the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra for a small number of particle systems with a quasi - one - dimensional shape . the density dependence of the lyapunov spectrum for the quasi - one - dimensional system is investigated to get a clearly visible stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra . in sect .",
    "[ periopp ] we consider the purely periodic boundary case ( the boundary case [ _ a1 _ ] ) , and investigate wavelike structures in the graphs [ _ b1 _ ] and [ _ b2 _ ] of lyapunov vector components . in sect .",
    "[ pppwwpww ] we consider the cases including a hard - wall boundary condition ( the boundary cases [ _ a2 _ ] , [ _ a3 _ ] and [ _ a4 _ ] ) with calculations of the graphs [ _ b1 _ ] and [ _ b2 _ ] , and compare the stepwise structures of the lyapunov spectra and the wavelike structures in the graphs [ _ b1 _ ] and [ _ b2 _ ] in the above four boundary cases .",
    "finally we give our conclusion and remarks in sect .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra is purely a many - particle effect of the chaotic dynamics , and so far it has been investigated in systems of 100 or more particles .",

    "one way to get the stepwise structure of lyapunov spectrum in a two - dimensional system consisting of a small number of particles is to choose a rectangular system rather than a square system , because the stepwise region in the lyapunov spectrum is wider in a more rectangular system rather than in a square system even if the number of particles is the same @xcite . noting this characteristic , we concentrate on the most rectangular case , namely the quasi - one - dimensional system defined by the conditions    @xmath17    a schematic illustration of the quasi - one - dimensional system is shown in fig .",

[ _ b _ ] how can we categorize the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra using the wavelike structure of the corresponding lyapunov vectors ? to consider the problem [ _ a _ ] also means to investigate the effects of the total momentum conservation law on the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra . in this paper we considered four types of the boundary conditions ; [ _ a1 _ ] periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions , [ _ a2 _ ] periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath3-direction and hard - wall boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction , [ _ a3 _ ] hard - wall boundary conditions in the @xmath3-direction and periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction , and [ _ a4 _ ] hard - wall boundary conditions in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-directions , in which we took the @xmath4-direction as the narrow direction of the rectangular shape of the system . with each boundary case we obtained different stepwise structures of the lyapunov spectra .",
    "in each boundary condition we also considered graphs of the following two quantities ; [ _ b1 _ ] the @xmath4-component @xmath5 of the spatial coordinate part of the lyapunov vector of the @xmath8-th particle corresponding to the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 as a function of the @xmath3-component @xmath6 of the spatial component of the @xmath8-th particle , and [ _ b2 _ ] the quantity @xmath10 with the @xmath4-component @xmath11 of the momentum coordinate of the @xmath8-th particle as a function of the position @xmath6 and the collision number @xmath145 .",
    "these quantities @xmath5 and @xmath10 give constant values in some of zero - lyapunov exponents , at least approximately .",
    "we found that the steps of the lyapunov spectra accompany a wavelike structure in the quantity @xmath5 or @xmath10 , depending on the kind of steps of the lyapunov spectra .",
    "a time - dependent oscillating behavior appears in the wavelike structure of the quantity @xmath10 , whereas the wavelike structure of the quantity @xmath5 is essentially stationary .",
    "fluctuations of these quantities @xmath5 and @xmath10 disturb their clear oscillatory structures , so we took a time - average of these quantities ( a local time - average for the quantity @xmath10 because of its time - oscillating behavior , and a longer time - average for the quantity @xmath5 because it is much more stationary in time than the quantity @xmath10 ) to get their dominant wavelike structures . in table .",
    "[ sumar ] we summarize our results about the characteristics of the stepwise structures of the lyapunov spectra and the wavelike structures of the lyapunov vectors in the four boundary cases [ _ a1 _ ] , [ _ a2 _ ] , [ _ a3 _ ] and [ _ a4 _ ] . in lyapunov exponents in each step of the lyapunov spectra the wavelike structures of the quantity @xmath5 or @xmath10 are approximately orthogonal to each others in space ( in the sense of eq .",

    "( [ lyapuoscil ] ) ) or in time ( in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ lyapuoscilwp ] ) ) , and this fact suggests that the wavelike structure of these quantities are sufficient to categorize the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectra in the quasi - one - dimensional systems considered in this paper .",
    "different from a purely two - dimensional model such as a square system in which each particle can collide with any other particle , in the quasi - one - dimensional model a separation between the stepwise region and the smoothly changing region of the lyapunov spectrum is not clear . in ref",
    "@xcite this point was explained as being caused by the fact that particles interact only with the two nearest - neighbor particles , whereas in the purely two - dimensional low - density system particles can interact with more than two particles .    in this paper",
    "we considered the quasi - one - dimensional systems only",
    ". however there should be many interesting other situations in which we can investigate structures of the lyapunov spectrum and the lyapunov vectors .",
    "for example , we may investigate the effect of the rotational invariance of the system on such structures by considering a two - dimensional system with a circle shape .",
    "one might also investigate the system in which the orbit is not deterministic any more , in order to know whether the deterministic orbit plays an important role in the stepwise structure of the lyapunov spectrum or not .",
    "it may also be important to investigate the dependence of the stepwise structures of the lyapunov spectra on the spatial dimension of the system , for example , to investigate any structure of the lyapunov spectra for purely one- or three - dimensional many particle systems .",
    "( note that the quasi - one - dimensional systems considered in this paper are still two - dimensional systems in the sense of the phase space dimension . )",
    "these problems remain to be investigated in the future .",
