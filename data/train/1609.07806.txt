    "a virus has been draining the resources of the world for the past three decades and the virus is called hiv , which stands for human immunodeficiency virus .",
    "the virus damages the immune system after a period of time , and this causes a variety of symptoms known as aids ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) .",
    "according to unaids / hiv [ 13 ] `` the pandemic of hiv and aids has continued to constitute serious health and socio economic challenges globally , for more than three decades . in the underdeveloped and developing countries which includes nigeria .",
    "hiv / aids has reversed many of the health and developmental gains over the past three decades as reflected by indices such as life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate among others '' .",
    "+    the interest of this work is to model the relationship pattern that describes the way at which hiv infection varies across gender , economic status and age - groups .",
    "also , to determine the notable factor(s ) that play major role in transmitting the virus among people of different social and economic classes per given population , and out of the various possible mode of transmission ( pmot ) , age - group , gender and economic status ; we want to determine if there is ( are ) any existence of individual or collective variability effect(s ) of these variables to hiv infection or otherwise .",
    "we shall verify the stability of our predictive model in order to obtain a prototype models that will adequately describe the pattern of the spread and also predict the trends of hiv infection among person(s ) of different socio - economic classes in oyo state .",
    "this will help the state government and other relevant non - governmental bodies to know the age group(s ) or socio - economic class that required urgent or long term plan interventions .",
    "+      hiv infects cells in the immune system and the central nervous system .",
    "the main type of cell that hiv infects is the t helper lymphocyte ; these cells play a crucial role in the immune system by coordinating the actions of other immune system cells .",
    "a large reduction in the number of t helper cells seriously weakens the immune system as hiv infects the t helper cell through the protein cd4 on its surface .",
    "hiv produces new copies of itself , which can then go on to infect many other cells .",
    "this process usually takes several years , see [ 2 ] for details .",
    "hiv virus is a communicable infection , for this work we classified all possible mode of transmission ( pmot ) of hiv under the following medically confirmed activities : sexual intercourse/ heterosexual contact , pregnancy ( mother - child transmission ) , sharp objects and blood transfusion .",
    "also , the social status is classified as employed , and unemployed .",
    "according to open dictionary[10 ] employment is work that you are paid regularly to do for a person or company while unemployed is define according to international labour organization[4 ] as active people who are without jobs .",
    "the logistic regression model is one of the popular statistical models for the analysis of binary data with applications in physical , biomedical , behavioural sciences , and many others .",
    "logistic regression analysis was implemented to determine the significant contributory factors influencing the subject of study [ 9 ] .",
    "the cases having the response variable as categorical , often called binary of ( yes / no ; present / absent ; etc ) and possible explanatory variables which can either be categorical variables , numerical variables or both are numerous in the biometry , psychometric , and epidemiology researches . in a longitudinal study of coronary heart disease as a function of age , gender , smoking history , cholesterol level , percentage of ideal body weight , and blood pressure ,",
    "the response variable @xmath0 was defined to have the two possible outcomes : person developed heart disease during the study or person did not develop heart disease during the study were modelled using the logistic regression model ( see [ 9 ] p555 - 556 ) .",
    "+   + l.m raposo and et al [ 7 ] used the logistic regression model to predict resistance to hiv protease inhibitor , the model obtained was said to be useful in decision making regarding the best therapy for hiv positive individuals .",
    "also , jinma ren and et al [ 6 ] _ `` risk of using logistic regression to illustrate exposure - response relationship of infectious diseases '' , the work was suspicious of the suitability of ordinary , categorical exposures , and logarithm transformation functions presented in logistic regression model to assess if the likelihood of infectious diseases is risk or as a result of exposure using simulated data .",
    "_ * however , the risk of using logistic regression is no risk at all if large sample size is used or procedure of large sample technique such as bootstrap re sampling method is used , this will reduce the bias in our estimates * _ * as it shall be demonstrated in this work*_. `` the odd function is the most suitable function for interpretation of binary predictive problems '' [ 1 ] .      the data used in this study can be classified as secondary data because they were not generated by the investigator .",
    "secondary data is a data collected initially for a particular purpose and it may not always provide detailed information , which a researcher needs .",
    "the implication of this kind of problem is that the researcher will generally resort to certain assumptions so as to fill the missing information .",
    "this reduces the scope , quality and amount of information required for the research .",
    "information on different variables of interests was collected from the records of central blood transfusion service unit oyo state , nigeria .",
    "information collected is sub topic into the followings data variables : gender ( qualitative variable ) : male/ female , age ( quantitative variable ) , possible mode of transmission ( pmot ) , employment status ( emp ) : employed / unemployed .",
    "400 observations of people that randomly visit the centre for hiv test for the purpose of medical diagnosis or for the purpose of blood donation were extracted out of the record that covers between years 2009 to 2014 .",
    "+   + the dataset includes the age of people that took the hiv test , so it is possible to calculate age in single years or age - groups .",
    "presence of hiv ( hiv+ ) and absent of hiv ( hiv - ) is measured as a simple dichotomy coded one and zero respectively .",
    "the fact that we treat all predictors as discrete factors allows us to summarize the data in terms of the numbers of hiv+ and hiv- in each of the five different age - groups .",
    "the reference classes of explanatory variables ( the male and the employed population ) are coded 0 , because they are traditionally believed to be less susceptible to hiv infection .",
    "we cross tabulate the variable pmot ( sexual intercourse , sharp object , mother - to - child and blood transfusion ) against age - group ( 0 - 15 , 16 - 39 , 40 - 54 , 55 - 69 , 70 and above in years ) , this will be treated as a qusi - experimental data .",
    "considering the case where our response @xmath1 is a dichotomous response , when possible response is either yes or no , death or alive , present or absent and as the case at hand in this work is either hiv negative or hiv positive .",
    "@xmath2 we code the present or absent of subject of study as 1 or 0 respectively .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 is binomial of a single trial or basically bernoulli distribution as used by some text .",
    "the binary indicator variable outcome can only be 1 or 0 as the probability is bound between 0 and 1 ; this gives a sigmodial shape approaching 0 and 1 asymptotically .",
    "this is a nonlinear problem .",
    "the logistic regression is suitable for such problem usually when response variable is qualitative of two possible outcomes .",
    "the logistic function relating @xmath1 to predictors which can be qualitative , quantitative or both is a very flexible model which makes it vital to solving many epidemiology and social indicator related problems .",
    "the logistic line can also be of form ;    @xmath3    @xmath4    probabilities ; given @xmath5 and @xmath6 , therefore @xmath7 @xmath8 is probability of our subject of interest in study taking place and @xmath9 is the probability of subject of interest not occurring .",
    "the subject of interest informs our choice of coding 1 or 0 , in the case of an indicator variable such as we have hiv+ is coded 1 and hiv- coded 0 .",
    "equation gives the probability @xmath10 given that level of parameter variable is @xmath11 .",
    "logistic regression model is a special case of general linear model , only that its conditional probability follows a bernoulli distribution .",
    "the special problems associated with model having binary response variable is the problem of having our error terms not normally distributed and heteroskadastic in nature due to the distribution of our response variable bonded between 0 and 1 .",
    "@xmath12    @xmath13 is not normally distributed .",
    "other problem associated with the logistic model is the constraints condition on response function ( see michael h. kutner and et al ; _ applied linear statistical models _",
    "fifth edition , p557 - 558 ) .",
    "the function form in equation has its left hand - side take value ranging between 0 and 1 , while the right hand - side is not in a form that can return values between 0 and 1 asymptotically .",
    "therefore , we require a link function to properly link the left hand - side to the right hand - side .",
    "link function such as identity will not be appropriate for the initial nonlinear problem at hand .",
    "however , for easier understanding and interpretations the logit function is usually employed .",
    "the model is initially best put in the form ;    @xmath14    also ; @xmath15 the interpretation of @xmath16 is not straightforward because increase in unit of x varies for the logistic regression model according to the location of the starting point of the x scale ( michael h. kutner and et al ) .",
    "the logit function is the natural logarithm ( in ) of odds of @xmath17 and taking exponential of the log of odd function gives us the most appreciable odd function , vital in our interpretation of result .",
    "the odd function will simplify our interpretation problem .",
    "@xmath18 explicitly ; @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 the inverse of the logit function is the logistic function .    hence ; @xmath25 the logistic function form will return the right hand - side to be property value ranging from 0 and 1 .",
    "the function increases monotonically if the gradient @xmath26 and decreases monotonically if @xmath27 .",

    "this makes the ordinary least square estimation ineffective in estimation of logistic function .",
    "the maximum likelihood is a better method for estimating logistic function since logistic function predicts probabilities , and not just classes , it can fit the probabilities for each class of our data - point , either for the class @xmath32 .",
    "we must also note that the error term is not usually considered in logistic problems . * *      the maximum likelihood estimate is that value of the parameter that makes the observed data most likely [ 12 ] .",

    ". the method of likelihood in estimating a logistic function usually requires numerical procedures , and fisher scoring or newton - raphson which often work best .",
    "most statistical packages have the logit numerical search procedure . in this work ,",
    "r - programming language package for logistic regression for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates of a logistic regression is used .",
    "let @xmath35 be n independent random variables ( r.v.s ) with probability density functions @xmath36 that depends on parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the likelihood of the joint density function of k independent observations is @xmath37 .",
    "then ; @xmath38 the root of the equation is obtained by equating the first derivative of equation to zero and the maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) hold when the second derivative is negative .",

    "it is a system of k nonlinear equations .",
    "the solution to the k unknown variables is a nonlinear problem can not be solved analytically but through numerical estimation using an iterative process .",
    "the newton - raphson method is popularly used for a logistic nonlinear function .",
    "however , problem of multicollinarity may arise which is visible when there are large estimated parameters and large standard error values .",
    "also , convergence problem in numerical search procedure can be associated with multicollinearity problem which can be overcome by reducing the number of parameter variables for easy and quick convergence .",
    "for details see [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] .          the general linear model rely on asymptotic approximations in estimating the coefficient standard errors and this may not be reliable , just as measures such as r - square based , residual errors are not very informative and can be misleading .",
    "therefore , using the method of bootstrap ( a re - sampling technique ) will either confirm or dispel our doubts about the sufficiency of our sample to estimate unbiased and robust estimates for the population parameters . for our models to adequately capture the reality of hiv / aids spread across different socio - economical classes in oyo state population as likely as possible , we shall generate 10,000 bootstrap samples from the original sample to estimate our models parameter values and their confidence intervals .",
    "in addition to the bootstrap method we shall also consider the multiple split sample procedure . these will help us in selecting robust parameter values for our models .",
    "bootstrapping technique has being identified to be effective in dealing with non - linear data with extremely non - normal distribution .",
    "see [ 3 ] .",
    "j. m bland and douglas g [ 5 ] mentioned that there are mainly three reasons to use the odds ratio . ``",
    "firstly , they provide an estimate ( with confidence interval ) for the relationship between two binary variables .",
    "secondly , they enable us to 162 a. o. bello et al .",
    ": application of bootstrap re - sampling method to a categorical data of hiv / aids spread across different social - economic classes examine the effects of other variables on that relationship , using logistic regression .",
    "thirdly , they have a special and very convenient interpretation . ''",
    "the odds are nonnegative , with odds 1.0 when a success is more likely than a failure .",
    "according to pedhazur [ 11 ] odds are determined from probabilities and range between 0 and infinity .",
    "odds are defined as the ratio of the probability of success and the probability of failure .",
    "+   + the odds of success given as @xmath51 and the odds of failure would be odds ( failure ) given as @xmath52 .",
    "the odds of success and the odds of failure are just reciprocals of one another .",
    "probability and odds both measure how likely it is that our subject of interest will occur .",
    "notably , the sign of the log - odds ratio indicates the direction of its relationship , the distinction regarding a positive or negative relationship in that of the odds ratios is given by which side of 1 the odd values fall on .",
    "odd value 1 indicates no relationship , less than one indicates a negative relationship and greater than one indicates a positive relationship .",
    "however , in order to get an intuitive sense of how much things are changing , we need to get the exponential of the log - odds ratio , which gives us the odds ratio itself [ 1 ]",
    ". the odd ratio of the odd for x=1 to the odd of x=0 is +    the odd ratio of the odd for x=1 to the odd of x=0 is    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55 @xmath56    this result obtained is the relationship between the odds ratio and an independent dichotomous .",
    "the result tells that the odds on the event that y equals 1 , increases ( or decreases ) by the factor @xmath57 among those with x= 1 than among those x= 0 .",
    "one major condition to note when interpreting for multiple logistic regression is that the estimated odds ratio for predictor variable x assumes that all other predictor variables are held constant .",
    "figure 1 & 2 : exploratory data analysis for our data    a lowess nonparametric response curve was fitted for the data ( see figure 1 and 2 ) , the plots show a sigmoidal s - shaped response function , and the lowess fit s - shape supported our choice of fitting a logistic regression model to the data .      *",

    "the residuals plotted against the predicted probability ( see figure 3 ) , shows the lowess smooth approximates a line having zero slope and intercept , and we can conclude that model inadequacy is not apparent .",
    "+    the original sample confidence intervals constructed for the coefficient estimates and that of the bootstrap confidence intervals coincide at almost the same intervals ; they agree quite well and these demonstrate the precision of the model coefficient estimates .",
    "the parameter estimates from the original observation and the 10,000 bootstrap samples were asymptotically the same , thus , we can conclude within approximately 95 percent confidence that our sample size is as sufficient as using any other larger sample size , all of our coefficient estimate are between 2.5% and 97.5% respectively .",

    "statistically , our sample size is a good representation of the entire population and sufficient to inferring the population characteristics",
    ". + also , from table 1 above , the coefficient of factors age and emp shows great statistical significance at 0.05 level of significance with a very small standard error values of 0.01133 and 0.246 respectively .",
    "gender is significant but not at 95% level of significance ; however , because of the prior importance of this natural factor to hiv infections in area of sexual intercourse , and also its significance at interaction level with employment status ( emp . )",

    "the male gender has almost five times lesser odd of contracting hiv compared to the female .",
    "moreover , value 1.56097 is the log odds ratio of male with employment of a given age contracting hiv ; the employed male population in oyo state odd ratio can also be translated to their probabilities of contracting hiv , given by exp(1.56097)(1+exp(1.56097 ) ) 0.8264925 .",
    "+ the negative coefficient value of age parameter suggests a negative relationship between age and hiv infection , which imply that the probability of contracting hiv decreases as age of person(s ) increases .",
    "the odds of contracting hiv given age can not be given a direct interpretation based on the question ` what unit of age is appropriate and applicable to show the change in odds ratio ? '",
    "the odds is best described by @xmath58 , given c is a difference of units of ages under comparison . for the difference of unit between age 39 and 54years , the odds of contracting hiv between age 39 and 54years is @xmath59 .",
    "for this we can now say the odd of contracting hiv decreases by 33% with each additional 15 years increase in age .",
    "the inverse relationship between age and probability of hiv infection suggests that the younger generation below 55years should be of first priority in all the efforts towards eradicating hiv / aids spread .",
    "+ also we could say that the result indicates a possibility that 33% of the infected persons in oyo state never survived the aids beyond 15years .",
    "this might be as a result of inadequate medical supports , psychological stigma and discrimination that is still associated with hiv / aids infection in africa , oyo state inclusive .",

    "+ also , from the table 1 above , the odds of a unemployed person(s ) in oyo state contracting hiv are five times more likely than that of their employed counterpart and the generally probability of unemployed population of a given age contracting hiv is exp(1.56097 + 1.64392)/ ( 1+exp(1.56097 + 1.64392))=0.9610179 .",
    "this result shows that the unemployed are more susceptible to hiv . + the difference in the odds ratio of hiv infection between the female and the male individuals in the population is 1.087145(8.7% ) .",
