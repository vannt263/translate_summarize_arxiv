    "the enormous interest to graphene is related to the unique physical properties of this two - dimensional material @xcite , which most possibly will be used in the future in numerous technological applications @xcite .",
    "an example of such properties of interest for the applications is the existence of very unusual spectrum of plasmon excitations with thz frequencies @xcite , that can be used in optoelectronics and communications .",
    "one of the most important problems to be solved to use graphene in electronics is the realization of effective control of the parameters of energy spectrum such as the electron energy gap and/or the velocity of electron and holes .",
    "it is already known that by using the electrostatic gating one can vary the carrier density of graphene ( i.e. , the location of chemical potential ) .",
    "recently , it was also proposed to use the external strain field to change the energy spectrum ",
    "this is called the strain engineering of graphene @xcite .",
    "the idea is mostly based on unusually strong effect of the external deformation acting on the energy spectrum of graphene quite similar to the external electric and magnetic fields @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the effect of periodic fields , which can be generated by periodic deformations , on the energy spectrum , screening of electron - electron interaction , and on the plasmon excitations in graphene .",
    "it was already pointed out that such periodic fields do not open the gap near the dirac point but affect the velocity parameter of electrons and holes @xcite making the energy spectrum anisotropic .",
    "recently , the effect of periodic modulation on electron spectrum of graphene has been studied experimentally @xcite . here",
    "we reconsider this problem in more details , concentrating on possible coexistence of periodic scalar and vector potentials , which , to our knowledge , has not been done before .",
    "this is important since a generic deformation produces both scalar and vector potentials @xcite .",
    "we use a different method to solve the problem @xcite , and find that our numerical results are in agreement with those of refs .",
    "we also discuss the role of screening due to the free carriers in graphene , and we find that screening can substantially suppress the effect of periodic scalar potential .    the combined effect of periodic scalar potential and constant magnetic field in graphene has been recently investigated by wu et al.@xcite they found that the structure of landau levels can be also strongly affected by the one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic fields .    the physics of plasmons in graphene has been intensively discussed recently by many authors .",
    "@xcite the calculations have been performed in frame of standard rpa approximation taking into account the electron energy structure of graphene near the dirac points , as well as for the whole energy spectrum at the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the effects of magnetic field , finite temperature , chemical potential have been investigated in the same approach @xcite . in this work",
    "we discuss the effect of external periodic fields on the screening and on the energy spectrum of plasmons .",
    "we consider first the transformation of electron energy spectrum related to deformations of the graphene lattice .",
    "it is known that the deformation of graphene is equivalent to the generation of electric and magnetic fields , which can be described by scalar @xmath0 and vector @xmath1 potentials @xcite .",

    "let us consider first some particular cases , when the periodic field is purely scalar @xmath10 or purely vector field @xmath11 .      in the case when @xmath33 and @xmath34 , eq.(8 ) essentially simplifies to @xmath35 and has two different solutions @xmath36 correspondingly , using eqs.(6 ) and",
