    "the logical propositions that represent physical questions in quantum mechanics are of the form ` the state of the system is an eigenvector of the operator @xmath0 with eigenvalue @xmath1 ' , for an observable @xmath0 .",
    "the non commutativity of the observable operators gives place to a non boolean logic for the propositions , in contrast to the case of the propositions about the phase space of a system in classical physics .",
    "this is mathematically described by the orthomodular lattice structure of projectors in hilbert space , which is often called quantum logic @xcite .",
    "the algebra of propositions about the space in classical physics is boolean .",
    "consider for example a particle , and the set of propositions of the form ` the particle is in the set @xmath2 ' .",
    "the opposite in this logic to the proposition given by the subset @xmath2 of the space is given by @xmath3 , the set of all points that do not belong to @xmath2 .",
    "a positive answer to @xmath2 implies a negative one to @xmath3 .",
    "the intersection and union of sets corresponds to the conjunction and disjunction of logical propositions about the physical system .",
    "the algebra of propositions becomes the same as the boolean algebra of subsets of the space in set theory .",
    "this structure is inherent to the space , because it will be the same for any system .",
    "however , as we will see in the following , the situation when including time is different . in the relativistic context",
    "the kinematics imposed by the causal structure will induce a non boolean character for the algebra of propositions given by certain space - time subsets ( see @xcite for the case of galilean physics ) .",
    "a particle can not be concentrated at a given point @xmath4 in space - time because it existed in the past and will exist in the future of @xmath4 , but we can think that the answer to the proposition given by a point is true if the particle passes through @xmath4 and false if not .",
    "the causal structure gives a definite prescription of what the opposite means in this case , because if the particle passes through @xmath4 it can not pass through any point spatially separated from @xmath4 .",
    "all the points non related by a time - like curve to a given set @xmath2 will form the causal and logical complement of @xmath2 .",
    "a surprising fact about the algebra of propositions that arises along this line of thought from the causal structure of space - time alone , independently of the propagating physical system , is that it is also an orthomodular lattice .",
    "though , we think , not widely known , this very interesting point was shown for minkowski space some time ago in ref.@xcite .    in this work we will show how to define the lattice of causally closed sets @xmath5 for a general space - time @xmath6 , even non causally well behaved , and prove that it is a complete orthomodular lattice .",
    "in addition , we will show that the lattice is atomic , and find its atoms .",
    "they are the points for causally well behaved space - times , but in general they can be of three different kinds .",
    "we will also find the necessary and sufficient conditions for this lattice to be irreducible .",
    "the lattice @xmath7 can have interest in two senses .",
    "we think that this lattice structure can be more fundamental than the causal structure of the space - time , much in the spirit of the studies of the postulates of quantum mechanics from the lattice perspective @xcite . in this sense",
    "this paper can be consider as a step in the study of the causal structure of space - times from an algebraic point of view .",
    "in fact , we find that certain undesirable aspects of the causal structure of general space - times as closed time - like curves can be eliminated or localized in the structure of @xmath7 , this lattice being largely independent of the details of the metric in the bad sectors of space - time . two space - times related by a conformal transformation will have the same causal structure and lattice @xmath7 , however the converse can be false .",
    "the other aspect of interest is the possible relation of @xmath7 with quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , motivated by the intriguing fact that causal structure and hilbert space share an important piece of its mathematical structure .",
    "we will not develop in this sense here .",
    "we note , however , that the causally closed sets in @xmath8 appear naturally in the algebraic approach to quantum field theory . in that context",
    ", we have a set of @xmath9-algebras associated to space - time sets .",
    "to a set in @xmath6 and its causal complement correspond two @xmath9-algebras that commute",
    ". however , the whole relation between the lattice structure and the operations among local algebras seems not to be completely clear at the moment @xcite .",
    "we will say a bit more in section iii .    to make this article as much self contained as possible , in the following section we include a brief introduction to orthomodular lattices and some relevant mathematical preliminaries .",
    "further details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in section iii",
    "we define the orthocomplemented complete lattice @xmath7 and discuss several related possibilities for constructing causal set lattices . in section iv we show that @xmath10 is orthomodular . in section v we show that it is atomic and find the atoms , which are an important piece in the understanding of the general structure of the lattice that will allows us to characterize irreducibility . in the last section we make some comments and discuss directions open to future work .",
    "the family of subsets @xmath11 of any set @xmath12 forms a boolean algebra when considered with the relation of inclusion , and the operations of intersection , union , and complement ( denoted @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ) .",
    "this is at the base of the relation between set theory and classical logic , where the propositions can be restated in terms of the subsets of a given set @xmath12 in set theory . to a given proposition",
    "@xmath17 we assign a subset @xmath2 with the interpretation that an element belongs to @xmath2 if and only if it satisfies the proposition @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the operations of implication , conjunction , disjunction , and negation between propositions are interpreted as the relation of inclusion , and the operations of intersection , union , and complement between subsets respectively .    in quantum mechanics the space of individuals is given by a hilbert space @xmath18 . the corresponding propositions or questions that are answered with a yes or a no ,",
    "are given by projection operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 . these operators must be observables , that is , auto - adjoint operators , @xmath21 , such that their domain is all @xmath22 , and in consequence they are also bounded .",
    "the projection operators are in one to one correspondence with the closed subspaces @xmath23 of @xmath22 , such that @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . here",
    "we use the notation @xmath26 for the subspace orthogonal to @xmath27 , which is always closed .",
    "the interpretation is that the proposition @xmath19 is true for the elements of @xmath23 and false for the elements of @xmath28 .",
    "here is possible to talk in terms of propositions ( projection operators ) or in terms of closed linear subspaces indistinctly , as it happens in the case of classical logic , where it is possible to talk in terms of propositions or in terms of sets .",
    "the set @xmath29 of closed subspaces of a hilbert space can be furnished with a structure that resembles the one in @xmath11 , where the relation of inclusion and the operation of intersection between linear subspaces are the set inclusion and intersection , but where the set complement is replaced by the operation of taking the orthogonal subspace , and the union of two sets by the sum of subspaces .",
    "the resulting structure is called an orthomodular lattice . in",
    "what follows we will describe this structure in detail .",
    "the inclusion between subsets is an order relation , that makes @xmath30 ( and @xmath31 ) a _ partially order set _ ( poset ) ,    @xmath32    in @xmath29 or @xmath11 there always exist elements that are the greatest lower bound ( g.l.b . ) and the lowest upper bound ( l.u.b ) of two given elements with respect to the order relation given by @xmath33 .",
    "in @xmath11 they are given by the set intersection and union while in @xmath34 by the set intersection and sum of linear subspaces .",
    "we will denote generically the g.l.b . and l.u.b .",
    "of two elements @xmath35 and @xmath36 as @xmath37 , and @xmath38 respectively , and call them the meet and the join of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the meet and the join are associative and symmetric .",
    "a poset where the join and the meet of any two elements always exist is called a _",
    "lattice_. a lattice is in addition _ complete _ if the meet and the join exist for arbitrary families of elements .",
    "a lattice @xmath39 have a _ unit _",
    "@xmath40 and a _ zero _ element @xmath41 if @xmath42 and @xmath43 for every element @xmath44 .",
    "an element @xmath35 in a lattice has a _",
    "@xmath36 if it is @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the lattice is called _ orthocomplemented _ ( or _ ortholattice _ )",
    "if there exist a unary operation @xmath47 that assigns to every element @xmath35 a complement @xmath48 , and in addition @xmath49    in an orthocomplemented lattice it can be deduced that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , what shows that the negation is a dual map with respect to the operations @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "both , @xmath11 and @xmath29 are complete and orthocomplemented . however , for the lattice @xmath11 holds the distributivity law @xmath54 while it is easy to see that it does not hold for @xmath29 .",
    "an orthocomplemented distributive lattice is called a _",
    "boolean algebra_. however , in the lattice @xmath29 holds a relaxation of the distributivity , called _",
    "orthomodularity is equivalent to the simpler relation @xmath56 for finite dimensional hilbert spaces a stronger form holds , the _ modular _ law , @xmath57 whose definition , as the one of distributivity , makes no use of the orthocomplementation operation .",
    "distributivity implies modularity and , for an orthocomplemented lattice , modularity implies orthomodularity .",
    "we see that the orthomodular law ( [ ortho ] ) means that distributivity holds under special circumstances for the elements involved . in the lattice of closed linear subspaces of the hilbert space , @xmath29 , when using the representation of projection operators , these conditions can be rewritten as that the projector @xmath58 commutes with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in a general orthocomplemented lattice two elements @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 are said to _ commute _ if @xmath61 the relation of commutativity is symmetric in orthomodular lattices , and the boolean subalgebras are formed by mutually commuting elements .",
    "we will need a few additional definitions . with two lattices @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath63 we can construct the _ direct product _ of lattices @xmath64 defined in the cartesian product of sets , and where the operations are done component by component .",
    "the product of orthomodular lattices is orthomodular .",
    "a lattice is _ irreducible _ if it can not be written as a direct product of lattices .",
    "an orthocomplemented lattice is irreducible if and only if its _ centre _ , that is , the set of elements that commute with all other elements , is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "an _ atom _ of a lattice is a non zero element @xmath35 such that @xmath35 and @xmath41 are the only elements included in @xmath35 .",
    "a lattice is _ atomic _ if every non zero element contains an atom .",
    "an orthomodular atomic lattice is also _",
    ", that is , every non zero element is the join of the atoms that contains .",
    "both , @xmath66 and @xmath29 are atomic , its atoms being the points in @xmath12 and the unidimensional vector spaces in @xmath22 .",
    "we will now describe a fundamental method for constructing complete orthocomplemented lattices that will be useful later @xcite .",
    "the orthocomplemented lattice will be constructed with a subset ( not a sublattice ) of a given complete lattice @xmath39 ( not necessarily orthocomplemented ) .",
    "the idea is to start with a would be complement operation @xmath67 and then to require the elements in the new lattice to be the @xmath44 that satisfy @xmath68 .",
    "this is imposed by eq.([negacion ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the case of a hilbert space , where , if we start with @xmath69 and propose the orthogonal to be the orthocomplement operation , the resulting lattice is @xmath29 , because the orthogonal of every set of vectors is a closed linear subspace .    given a complete lattice @xmath39 a _ galois connection _ in @xmath39 is a unary operation @xmath70 in @xmath39 such that @xmath71 the operation @xmath72 is called a _ closure operation _",
    ", and the elements @xmath35 of @xmath39 that satisfy @xmath73 are called _ closed _ with respect to the closure operation @xmath74 .",
    "the closure @xmath75 has the following properties @xmath76 if we want the galois connection @xmath70 to be an orthocomplementation we must pick up the elements of the lattice such that the closure operation is the identity operator in them , as is enforced by eq.([negacion ] ) .",
    "indeed , if we further have @xmath77 the set of closed elements @xmath78 of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath74 , forms a complete orthocomplemented lattice where the order and the meet are the order and the meet in @xmath39 , the complement is given by @xmath70 and the join is the join in @xmath39 followed by the operation of closure @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we add that there is a very natural way to construct a galois connection in the lattice @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath79 be a symmetric reflexive relation between points in the set @xmath12 , with no further requirements .",
    "thus @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the operation @xmath82 given by @xmath83 that is , the set of all points not related by @xmath79 with no point of @xmath84 , is a galois connection that satisfies eqs.([g1 ] , [ g2 ] ) and ( [ x1 ] , [ x2 ] ) .",
    "the space - time we will consider is a ( hausdorff ) manifold @xmath6 of dimension @xmath85 with a pseudometric tensor @xmath86 with signature @xmath87 , smooth and non singular everywhere . we do not ask the space - time @xmath6 to be time orientable nor to satisfy any causality condition ( for example to be free from closed time - like curves ) . for a review of causal structure see refs .",
    "@xcite . given a definite naming of the local light cones of a point @xmath4 as future and past light cones , its causal future and past , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are defined as the set of points that can be reached by time - like curves starting at @xmath4 with tangent vector in the future and past light cone of @xmath4 respectively .",
    "when referring to time - like curves we always mean differentiable curves with continuous tangent vector except a finite number of points where the tangent can have a discontinuity , but keeping always in the same local light cone .",
    "these discontinuities can always be removed by modifications in arbitrarily small neighborhoods .",
    "the past and future of @xmath4 are open sets .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath90 for the open set @xmath91 that always makes sense , even in non time - orientable space - times .",
    "the natural orhtocomplement operation for sets in @xmath6 based on the causal structure identifies all that is not time - like related to a given set with its complement . to be explicit",
    ", we can define in @xmath6 a symmetric reflexive relation that relies only on the causal structure .",
    "given two points @xmath4 and @xmath92 of @xmath6 we write @xmath93 , and say that @xmath4 and @xmath92 are time - connected or just connected , if there is time - like curve that passes through @xmath4 and @xmath92 .",
    "thus , @xmath93 is equivalent to @xmath94 .",
    "all points that are not time - connected to @xmath4 must be in the complement of @xmath4 .",
    "starting from this complement operation , as it was described in the previous section , we can construct a complete orthocomplemented lattice coming from the galois connection in @xmath95 given by eq.([cual ] ) .",
    "we call it the lattice of the causally closed sets @xmath7",
    ". the orthocomplement is given by    @xmath96    and , @xmath97 if and only if @xmath98 .",
    "1 shows an example of @xmath99 and @xmath100 for a set @xmath101 . an important property to keep in mind",
    "is that , for every set @xmath2 , the opposite @xmath99 is already an element of @xmath102 , because @xmath103 .",
    "a typical element @xmath2 of @xmath104 in minkowski space is a diamond shaped set , with the upper and lower cone being null surfaces included in @xmath2 , while the points in the spatial corner may or may not be in @xmath2 .",
    "however , in minkowski space many other sets , including lower dimensional objects , are in the lattice .",
    "the bounded null surfaces of dimension @xmath105 or lower are sets in @xmath102 while space - like surfaces of dimension @xmath106 or less are in @xmath104 , while spatial surfaces of dimension @xmath105 are not . on the other hand",
    "every set with at least two different points time - like connected will generate a set that contains an open set in @xmath6 .",
    "the sets generated by subsets in achronal surfaces form boolean subalgebras .",
    "the meet in @xmath7 is just the set intersection .",
    "the join of a family of elements is given by the set union followed by the causal closure ( the double orthogonal ) @xmath107 the join of two sets is exemplified in fig .",
    "2 . for two",
    "spatially separated sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 the set @xmath108 will be just the set union @xmath109 , while otherwise @xmath38 will contain also at least all the time - like curves that connect points from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "in general , for a set @xmath35 in @xmath6 , the causal closure @xmath110 is bigger than the domain of dependence of @xmath35 , taking this latter as the set of points such that all past ( future ) inextendible time - like curves from the point intersects the given set @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the lattice @xmath7 is not distributive nor modular in the general case , as it is shown for minkowski space in fig .",
    "3(a ) and fig.3(b ) , while it is orthomodular as will be shown in the next section and is illustrated in fig .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the lattice @xmath102 has a logical interpretation in terms of propositions for classical particles .",
    "the proposition corresponding to a space - time subset @xmath2 is given by `` the particle passes through s '' .",
    "however , for an arbitrarily chosen set @xmath2 the logical opposite of that proposition is `` the particle does not passes through @xmath2 '' . in general",
    "this is not of the form `` the particle passes through @xmath111 '' for some space - time subset @xmath111 .",
    "the prescription of taking causally closed sets is just what is needed to have a closed algebra of propositions coming from space - time subsets in the above sense .",
    "in contrast to the case of the boolean logic of space subsets , here only some subsets of space - time have an opposite in terms of space - time subsets , and the resulting algebra is non boolean .",
    "the logical interpretation of the operation @xmath112 between two propositions corresponding to the sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 is given by the maximal space - time proposition that implies `` the particle passes through @xmath35 and @xmath36 '' , while the proposition corresponding to @xmath38 is given by the minimal space - time proposition implied by `` the particle passes through @xmath35 or @xmath36 '' .",
    "it is immediate that when the manifold @xmath6 is non connected the lattice @xmath7 is the direct product of the lattices @xmath113 of each connected component @xmath114 of @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the lattice is reducible .",
    "we will see a sufficient condition for irreducibility in section v.    one can try to construct other lattices based on the causal structure of @xmath115 . for example , the basic symmetric and reflexive relation between points used to define the orthocomplement can be taken as the relation @xmath116 , that holds if there is a space - like curve passing through @xmath4 and @xmath92 , or @xmath117 , that holds if there is a causal curve ( i.e. a curve with time - like or null tangent ) passing through @xmath4 and @xmath92 , or @xmath118 , that holds if there is null curve passing through @xmath4 and @xmath92 , or several logical combinations between them ( no discontinuities are allowed in the tangent to null and causal curves ) . accordingly , three orthocomplemented and complete lattices can be constructed , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "the lattice @xmath119 is trivial when @xmath122 because a space - like curve from a point can get inside the light cone , while in two dimensions it does not add anything new to @xmath123 .",
    "the same triviality will occur in @xmath7 if the metric would have more than one time directions .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath124 and @xmath125 fail to be orthomodular in the simplest case of minkowski space .",
    "it seems that in the case of @xmath125 it is not possible to change slightly the definition of the lattice to make it orthomodular .",
    "the lattice @xmath120 differs from @xmath8 fundamentally in details of the borders of the sets , what is crucial for orthomodularity .",
    "other logical combinations seem to lead to the same lattices or to uninteresting and trivial cases .",
    "one may wonder if there is another way for constructing a causal lattice that yielding open sets or sets with better topological properties .",
    "a lattice of open sets can be constructed using the complete lattice @xmath126 of open sets in @xmath6 as a base where to define the galois connection @xcite .",
    "the join in @xmath127 is the usual set union and the meet of arbitrary families of open sets is given by the set intersection followed by the operation of interior .",
    "then we define @xmath128 for an open @xmath2 as @xmath129 where here @xmath130 means the usual topological closure of @xmath35 .",
    "this satisfies eqs.([g1 ] , [ g2 ] ) and ( [ x1 ] , [ x2 ] ) , and lead to a complete orthocomplemented lattice @xmath131 of open sets . however , again due to details in the borders of the sets , the lattice is not orthomodular , as is shown in fig .",
    "4 . it can be shown , at least for globally hyperbolic space - times , that distributivity in @xmath132 holds under a little more stringent conditions than the required by orthomodularity .",
    "in fact , instead of eq.([or ] ) we have @xmath133    it seems essential for orthomodularity that the lattice should contain along with the diamond shaped sets at least the null surfaces .",
    "once we have null surfaces in the lattice its intersection will generate lower dimensional sets as lines and points .",
    "this makes difficult a correspondence between the elements in an orthomodular lattice of causal sets with @xmath9-algebras in the algebraic approach to quantum field theory , because the points should be assigned non trivial algebras ( two points can generate a set that includes an open set ) ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the lattice @xmath134 would be a better candidate , but it is only approximately orthomodular in the sense of eq.([apro ] ) ( weaker conditions for distributivity can also be found ) .",
    "form now on we will only refer to @xmath7 . from its definition",
    "we see that it does not change with conformal transformations , and thus it is a property of the conformal structure .",
    "we will now prove that @xmath7 is orthomodular in any space - time .",
    "first , we will prove the following previous result .",
    "* lemma 1 * : given a time - like curve @xmath135 parametrized by a real variable @xmath136 in a closed interval @xmath137 $ ] and a set @xmath138 , the intersection @xmath139 ) \\cap s$ ] is empty or it is a closed segment of @xmath140 , corresponding to @xmath141\\subseteq [ a , b]$ ] .",

    "then , if the intersection @xmath139 ) \\cap s$ ] is non empty , let @xmath74 and @xmath153 be the infimum and supremum of the points @xmath136 in @xmath154 $ ] such that @xmath155 .",
    "the point @xmath156 is connected with @xmath2 so @xmath157 @xmath99 , then if @xmath158 it is connected also with @xmath99 , and thus belong to the open set @xmath159 .",
    "a neighborhood of @xmath160 will belong to @xmath161 and will not be in @xmath162 , what is not possible , so @xmath163 .",
    "similarly we have @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , a set @xmath2 in @xmath7 contains all time - like segments between points in @xmath2 and also the time - like border of @xmath2 , that is , the border of @xmath2 accessible from @xmath2 by time - like curves .",
    "the points in the space - like border of @xmath2 may or may not belong to @xmath2 . using lemma 1",
    "we prove    * theorem 1 : * @xmath7 is orthomodular    orthomodularity is the implication @xmath165 for any @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath7 .",
    "if the set @xmath36 is included in @xmath35 it is also included in @xmath166",

    "to start we assume that @xmath168 .",
    "let @xmath169 , so @xmath170 and @xmath171 . therefore no time - like curve connects @xmath4 with @xmath172 nor with @xmath173",
    "we have to prove that @xmath174 .",
    "then , let us suppose that @xmath175 and show that it leads to a contradiction .",
    "this assumption implies that there is a time - like curve @xmath140 that connects @xmath4 with a point @xmath176 .",
    "as @xmath4 is not connected with @xmath48 nor with @xmath177 it is @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "a segment of @xmath180 with end points @xmath4 and @xmath92 intersects @xmath181 and @xmath35 in non empty sets , which according to lemma 1 are closed segments .",
    "these are disjoint , because otherwise @xmath4 could be connected with a point in @xmath173 .",
    "thus , there is a point @xmath182 in the segment of @xmath140 between @xmath4 and @xmath92 that is not in @xmath183 nor in @xmath35 . as @xmath184",
    ", @xmath182 can be connected with a point @xmath185 .",
    "thus , as @xmath182 is in the segment of @xmath186 between @xmath4 and @xmath92 it is either @xmath92 connected with @xmath187 or @xmath4 connected with @xmath187 .",
    "however , the point @xmath188 can not be connected with @xmath185 .",
    "then @xmath170 is connected with @xmath189 by a curve passing through @xmath182 .",
    "then , by lemma 1 , it is @xmath190 , what shows a contradiction . therefore @xmath174 and orthomodularity holds .",
    "of course , there are orthomodular lattices that are not of the form @xmath191 for a space - time @xmath6 . in the following section we go a step further in the characterization of causal structures from the lattice theoretical point of view by showing that @xmath7 is atomic , and finding its atoms .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we will extract what are the essential properties of the causal structure used in the proof of orthomodularity ( see ref.@xcite for a related discussion ) .    for constructing an orthocomplemented lattice we used a symmetric reflexive relation between points in the space - time with no further properties .",
    "now we can read from the previous theorem what additional structure of the causal relation @xmath192 that we used in the definition of @xmath7 is central in the proof of orthomodularity .",

    "@xmath4 and any curve @xmath140 with @xmath194 , the points @xmath195 with @xmath196 belong to two sets , non necessarily disjoint , that we can call the past and future sets of @xmath197 .",
    "we have either all @xmath149 for @xmath198 belong to the future of @xmath4 and all @xmath149 for @xmath199 belong to the past of @xmath4 or vice versa . if a point @xmath92 is in the future set of @xmath4 , then either all the future set of @xmath92 or the past set of @xmath92 are included in the future set of @xmath4 , and , in addition , there is a neighborhood of @xmath92 ( in the sense induced by the real numbers ) in all time - like curves passing through @xmath92 that belongs to the future set of @xmath4 .",
    "the same can be said regarding the past set of @xmath4 .",
    "these geometrical properties , that are immediate for the time - like curves in a general space - time @xmath6 , are sufficient in order to have an orthomodular lattice generated by the relation @xmath192 .",
    "we see that certain sort of transitivity condition is essential for the causal relation but , for non orientable space - times no global transitive relation can be defined .",
    "there is also a condition of continuity .",
    "none of these is respected by the relation @xmath200 defined in the preceding section , while the relation @xmath201 does not respect the continuity condition .",
    "an atom @xmath2 in @xmath202 must be equal to the set @xmath203 generated by any point @xmath204 , because @xmath205 is a non empty element of @xmath7 included in @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , all atoms are of the form @xmath205 for some point @xmath4 , what shows what are the sets among which to look for atoms .",
    "however , the element @xmath203 need not be an atom .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath4 as a subset of @xmath115 is an element of @xmath202 , @xmath206 , then it is an atom .",
    "this is the case for all points in minkowski space .",
    "we will now analyze which of the points of @xmath6 are atoms in the general case .    as we noted before ,",

    "the points @xmath4 that belong to closed time - like curves or are vertex points can be characterized as all points that belong to @xmath212 for some @xmath92 of @xmath6 ( any @xmath92 of @xmath140 in the open segment between @xmath4 and @xmath4 for example )",
    ". we will call it the set @xmath213 of bad points of @xmath6 , @xmath213 @xmath214 . as union of open sets , @xmath215 is also open .",
    "the set of points in closed time - like curves @xmath216 , and the set of vertices @xmath217 , are also separately open , and by definition @xmath218 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath219 , where @xmath186 is a closed time - like curve , and take a sufficiently small , open , time orientable , normal neighborhood @xmath12 of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath182 be two points of an interval of @xmath186 included in @xmath12 that contains @xmath4 , respectively in the future @xmath220 and past @xmath221 of @xmath4 , where @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the notions of future and past in the submanifold @xmath12 . doing a composition with the curve @xmath186 , we have that all points in the open neighborhood @xmath224 of @xmath4 are connected by a closed time - like curve to every point in @xmath186 .",
    "thus , the set of points connected by closed time - like curves to a point @xmath4 form an open subset @xmath225 of @xmath216 .",
    "it is immediate that the sets of the form @xmath225 are either disjoint or identical , so @xmath216 is the union of disjoint sets of the form @xmath225 . note that for any time - like curve @xmath226 that passes through @xmath4 we have that there is an open interval around @xmath4 in @xmath226 that is included in a closed time - like curve trough @xmath4 .",
    "the proof that @xmath217 is open can be done similarly .",
    "the following lemma solves the question of when a point in @xmath6 is an element , and therefore an atom , in @xmath7    * lemma 2 : * the set formed by a point @xmath4 in @xmath6 is an element and an atom in @xmath7 if and only if @xmath227    as we have seen if @xmath228 the set formed by @xmath4 is not an element of @xmath7 and can not be an atom .",
    "we will show that if @xmath4 is not an atom then @xmath228 . let us suppose @xmath229 .",

    "the point @xmath92 must be time connected with @xmath4 otherwise it would be @xmath232 .",
    "therefore @xmath233 and a connected , time orientable , open neighborhood @xmath12 of @xmath4 is included in @xmath234 .",

    "in other words @xmath236 is separated from @xmath4",

    "they cover all the connected set @xmath243 , and thus must have a non empty intersection , with a point @xmath187 .",
    "therefore @xmath4 belongs to @xmath244 and thus @xmath228 .",
    "we have shown that in the closed set @xmath245 all points are atoms .",
    "next we will show that a different kind of atoms can exist in space - times that have both types of defects , closed time - like and vertex curves .",
    "consider the time - like curve @xmath246 of fig .",
    ". we will call such a curve a _ bridge_. it is a closed time - like curve but also a past and future vertex curve for all points in the curve .",
    "the essential property of a bridge is that for any point @xmath4 in it one can construct a time - like curve that passes through @xmath4 with tangent in any light cone and passes through any point @xmath92 in the bridge with tangent in the any light cone of @xmath92 .",
    "thus any two points time connected with two points in the bridge @xmath247 are also connected to each other .",
    "then we have the following    * lemma 3 : * the set @xmath248 generated by any bridge @xmath249 is an atom    let @xmath250 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . if @xmath230 then @xmath92 is connected with @xmath4 .",
    "the set @xmath251 is included in @xmath252 and if they are different it must be @xmath253 . in that case",
    "@xmath4 must be connected with @xmath254 .",
    "but that is not possible because as @xmath4 belongs to a bridge it would lead to @xmath92 connected with @xmath255 .",
    "thus @xmath256 for every @xmath257 and @xmath205 is an atom that includes @xmath247 .",
    "we will call the set @xmath258 generated by a bridge @xmath246 a _ bridge atom_. any bridge atom contains an open set .",
    "we also have that two atoms can not intersect .",
    "therefore in a paracompact manifold there can be at most a numerable amount of bridge atoms .",
    "the bridge atoms must be totally included in the set of bad points @xmath213 .",
    "we have shown what happens to the sets @xmath205 for @xmath259 or @xmath4 in @xmath248 where @xmath247 is a bridge . in both cases @xmath205 is an atom .",

    "first consider the case where @xmath4 is a vertex .",
    "we have    * lemma 4 : * the set @xmath205 where @xmath4 is a vertex contains a point in @xmath245 or a bridge atom    let @xmath260 , @xmath261 $ ] , and @xmath262 be a vertex curve of the vertex @xmath4 . let us suppose that every point in @xmath140 is in @xmath263 . for every value of the parameter",

    "thus , the direction of the tangent vector at the point @xmath265 will mark the future light cone of @xmath4 at @xmath266 , but it will be a different light cone of the point @xmath4 than the future light cone at @xmath267 . for any @xmath264 such that the point @xmath268 is a vertex , we can define it as a future or a past vertex according the vertex curve based at @xmath92 starts with tangent in the future or the past light cone of @xmath92 at @xmath264 .",
    "let us call @xmath269 $ ] and @xmath270 $ ] the set of values of the parameter that have future and past vertices respectively .",
    "these sets are non empty as @xmath271 has a future vertex and @xmath272 has a past vertex .",
    "if @xmath273 has a past vertex and @xmath274 has a future vertex and @xmath275 , then both vertex curves together with @xmath276)$ ] will form a bridge .",
    "let the infimum of @xmath277 be @xmath278 and the supremum of @xmath279 be @xmath280 , and assume @xmath281 .",

    "then it is easy to see that the union of @xmath292)$ ] with the vertices at @xmath284 and @xmath285 is a bridge .",
    "then let us consider now the case of points in closed time - like curves .",
    "let @xmath4 be a point in @xmath216 and @xmath225 be the connected component of @xmath216 that includes @xmath4 .",
    "it is @xmath293 .",
    "if @xmath294 is a connected component of @xmath6 then @xmath294 will be an atom .",
    "if this is not the case , let @xmath92 be a point in the border of @xmath295 .",
    "the point @xmath92 can only be a vertex or a point in @xmath296 .",
    "therefore if @xmath297 contains a point in the border of @xmath225 it will contain an atom .",
    "but any point in the border of @xmath225 that can be reached by a time - like curve passing through a point in @xmath297 must belong to @xmath297 because of lemma 1 .",
    "thus , if there are no point or bridge atoms in @xmath297 we have @xmath298 .",
    "a point in the set @xmath299 can not be joined by a time - like curve to @xmath225 , and , as every point is in the future or the past of a different point , it is @xmath300 .",
    "therefore @xmath225 and @xmath299 are open disjoint sets that cover @xmath6 , and @xmath294 is a connected component of @xmath6 .    resuming",
    ", we have shown    * theorem 2 * : @xmath7 is an atomic lattice .",
    "its atoms are all the points in @xmath245 , the bridge atoms , and the connected components of @xmath6 included in @xmath216    taking into account that @xmath7 is orthomodular we also have ,    * corollary : * @xmath7 is atomistic    that is , every element is the join of the atoms that includes .",
    "thus , from the algebraic point of view all the bad points of the space - time disappear from the algebra , except the discrete bridge atoms and connected components included in @xmath216 ( see fig",
    "these later obviously commute with all @xmath7 and then belong to the centre .",
    "we can see that the same is true for the bridge atoms as follows .",
    "* lemma 5 : * the bridge atoms belong to the centre of @xmath7    if an atom does not belong to @xmath301 for a bridge @xmath247 it must be connected with @xmath247 . if the atom is a point @xmath4 then as @xmath4 is connected with @xmath247 it implies that @xmath4 is a vertex , what is not consistent with @xmath4 being an atom . then let the bridge @xmath302 be connected with @xmath247 , it is easy to see that both will generate the same set , @xmath303 ( they form a unique bridge curve ) . thus an atom is either equal to @xmath248 or is included in @xmath301 , and therefore commutes with @xmath248 .",
    "as @xmath7 is atomistic , and every element is the join of its atoms , @xmath304 will commute with all the elements of the lattice @xcite .",
    "we have shown that if the manifold is not connected or if it contains at least two atoms and a bridge then @xmath7 is reducible .",
    "we will complete the following    * theorem 3 : * @xmath7 is trivial ( equal to @xmath305 ) if and only if @xmath306 for a bridge @xmath247 or @xmath115 is connected and @xmath307 . if non trivial , @xmath8 is irreducible if and only if @xmath6 is connected and does not contain any bridge curves    assume that @xmath6 does not have bridge curves , nor connected components includes in @xmath308 . then , its only atoms are the points in @xmath245",
    ". we can identify all the sets in @xmath7 with the set of its atoms , @xmath309 .",
    "let now @xmath2 be a proper element in @xmath310 .",
    "if there is a point @xmath4 in @xmath311 it will be an atom that does not commute with @xmath2 ( see eq.([commu ] ) ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath2 is in the centre of @xmath102 , it must be @xmath312 , and @xmath313 .",
    "let @xmath92 be a point in @xmath6 , then , as the atoms that generate @xmath251 are in @xmath2 or in @xmath99 , we have @xmath314 , the last equality coming from the form of the join for orthogonal sets .",
    "thus , @xmath92 belongs to @xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 .",
    "then , all future and past of all points of @xmath2 must be in @xmath2 , otherwise @xmath2 would be connected with @xmath99 , and , as for a point @xmath182 @xmath318 there is always a different point @xmath187 in a neighborhood that is in @xmath319 , and so @xmath182 @xmath320 with @xmath321 .",
    "therefore @xmath322 is an open set .",
    "the same can be said for @xmath323 , @xmath324 .",
    "therefore , @xmath325 is non connected .",
    "the case where @xmath7 is nontrivial and irreducible is the most interesting for physical space - times . in that case",
    "there is a non countably number of atoms formed by the points in @xmath326 , that can be consider the relevant space - time from the algebraic point of view .",
    "we have already mentioned that the lattice @xmath29 of closed linear subspaces of the hilbert space is complete , atomic , irreducible and orthomodular .",
    "it has a further property called the _ covering law_. an element @xmath35 in a lattice is said to _ cover _",
    "@xmath36 if @xmath168 and if for every element @xmath201 such that @xmath327 it is @xmath328 or @xmath329 .",
    "the covering law means that given an atom @xmath84 and an element @xmath35 with @xmath330 , then @xmath331 covers @xmath35 .",
    "there exist reconstruction theorems stating that a complete , atomic , irreducible , orthomodular lattice , satisfying the covering law , can be represented as a lattice of closed linear subspaces of a vector space with a hermitian form @xcite . under minor assumptions regarding the field of scalars for the vector space",
    "it is the lattice of a hilbert space .",
    "thus , a lattice with this set of properties characterize almost uniquely hilbert spaces .",
    "the lattice @xmath7 is also complete , atomic and orthomodular , and , in most of the physically interesting cases , irreducible .",
    "however , the covering law does not apply . for example , the join of two points connected by a time - like curve in minkowski space does not cover any of them .",
    "this is the essential difference with @xmath29 , that obstructs the immersion of the lattice in a linear structure @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore what additional algebraic properties does the lattice @xmath7 have , and , if possible , to find a set of properties that characterize the lattices of causally closed sets in the sense of a reconstruction theorem as the already mentioned . such a possibility is suggested by the fact that the causal structure for stably causal space - times determines not only its conformal structure , but also the topological and differential structure of the manifold @xcite .",
    "the next step in the construction of a dictionary between the causal structure and the algebraic setting is to translate into the lattice theoretical language the different causality conditions such as strong causality and stable causality .",
    "taub - nut like space - times or the space - time of fig . 8",
    "are not strongly causal and the structure of the resulting lattices is that of a _ horizontal sum _ of several lattices . given two lattices @xmath332 and @xmath333 , their horizontal sum is the lattice formed by the set union of @xmath332 and @xmath333 , where the unit and zero elements are identified ( see fig . 8) , so that the meet and join of an element of @xmath332 with an element of @xmath333 are @xmath41 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "as a different kind of example we note that the galilean space - time gives place to a causal lattice formed by the horizontal sum of the boolean algebras corresponding to the space at different times .",
    "all this suggest that the appearance of horizontal sums is characteristic of non causally well behaved space - times .",
    "we postpone the general analysis for a future paper @xcite .",
    "another application of the lattice framework could be found in the study of the asymptotic infinity .",
    "the spatial corner have a very simple expression in the algebraic context , being simply the image of @xmath7 under an endomorphism of orthomodular lattices @xcite .",
    "the causal structure is more fundamental in a logical sense than other aspects of space - time such as the metric .",
    "as we have already recalled , it also determines the topological and differential structure in well behaved space - times . in part motivated by this fact , there are in the literature approaches to quantum gravity that use a poset or lattice structure representing a causal order in space - time as a fundamental object .",
    "one is based on an axiomatic generalization of the history approach to quantum mechanics to a situation where the time evolution is less rigid than in ordinary quantum theory @xcite .",
    "another one , parts from discrete posets that would represent the causal structure at the planck scale , and looks at the possible dynamics and the large scale structure that emerges @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if the discussion in this paper , also focused in a lattice structure coming from the causal order , could add to these various invertigations .",
