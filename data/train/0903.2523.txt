    "then it is natural to ask the following : .2 cm    * question 1 : * can we find any new invariants of comibnatorial manifolds independent from euler characteristic among nonlinear functions on the numbers of simplices of the manifold?.2 cm    [ pachner 1986 ,  @xcite ] [ thm : pachner ] two closed combinatorial n - manifolds are pl- homeomorphic if and only if it is possible to move between their triangulations using a sequence of bistellar moves ( pachner moves ) and simplicial isomorphisms .

    "since we have combinatorial manifolds with the same dimension and euler characteristic but different rational pontryagin numbers , so there could not be any formulae for rational pontryagin numbers that depend only on the number of simplices in a combinatorial manifold .",
