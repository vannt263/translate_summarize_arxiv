    "the liquid  -solid transition in systems of particles under the influence of external modulating potentials has recently attracted a fair amount of attention from experiments  @xcite , theory  @xcite and computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that well controlled , clean experiments can be performed using colloidal particles  @xcite confined between glass plates ( producing essentially a two  -dimensional system ) and subjected to a spatially periodic electromagnetic field generated by interfering two , or more , crossed laser beams .",
    "one of the more surprising results of these studies , where a commensurate , one dimensional , modulating potential is imposed , is the fact that there exist regions in the phase diagram over which one observes re  -entrant  @xcite freezing / melting behaviour . as a function of the laser field intensity the system first freezes from a modulated liquid to a two dimensional triangular solid  a further increase of the intensity confines the particles strongly within the troughs of the external potential , making the system quasi  -one  -dimensional which increases fluctuations and leads to re  -melting .",
    "our present understanding of this curious phenomenon has come from early mean  -field density functional  @xcite and more recent dislocation unbinding  @xcite calculations .",
    "the mean field theories neglect fluctuations and therefore can not explain re  -entrant behaviour .",
    "the order of the transition is predicted to be first order for small laser field intensities , though for certain combinations of external potentials ( which includes the specific geometry studied in the experiments and in this paper ) the transition may become second order after going through a tricritical point . in general , though mean field theories are applicable in any dimension , the results are expected to be accurate only for higher dimensions and long ranged potentials .",
    "the validity of the predictions of such theories for the system under consideration is , therefore , in doubt .",
    "a more recent theory  @xcite extends the dislocation unbinding mechanism for two  -dimensional melting  @xcite for systems under external potentials .",
    "for a two  -dimensional triangular solid subjected to an external one  -dimensional modulating potential , the only dislocations involved are those which have their burger s vectors parallel to the troughs of the potential .",
    "the system , therefore , maps onto an anisotropic , scalar coulomb gas ( or xy model )  @xcite in contrast to a _ vector _ coulomb gas  @xcite for the pure @xmath0 melting problem .",
    "once bound dislocation pairs are integrated out , the melting temperature is obtained as a function of the renormalized or `` effective '' elastic constants which depend on external parameters like the strength of the potential , temperature and/or density .",
    "though explicit calculations are possible only near the two extreme limits of zero and infinite field intensities one can argue effectively that a re  -entrant melting transition is expected on general grounds quite independent of the detailed nature of the interaction potential for any two  -dimensional system subject to such external potentials .",
    "the actual extent of this region could , of course , vary from system to system .",
    "in addition , these authors predict that the auto  -correlation function of the fourier components of the density ( the debye  -waller correlation function ) decays algebraically in the solid phase with a universal exponent which depends only on the geometry and the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "computer simulation results in this field have so far been inconclusive .",
    "early simulations  @xcite involving colloidal particles interacting via the derjaguin , landau , verwey and overbeek ( dlvo ) potential  @xcite found a large re  -entrant region in apparent agreement with later experiments . on closer scrutiny , though , quantitative agreement between simulation and experiments on the same system ( but with slightly different parameters ) appears to be poor  @xcite .",
    "subsequent simulations  @xcite have questioned the findings of the earlier computation and the calculated phase diagram does not show a significant re  -entrant liquid phase .    motivated , in part , by this controversy , we have investigated the freezing / melting behaviour of an unrelated system subjected to similar modulating external potentials . in this paper",
    "we have computed the phase behaviour of a two dimensional hard disk system in an external potential .",
    "the pure hard disk system is rather well studied  @xcite by now and the nature of the melting transition in the absence of external potentials reasonably well explored . also , there exist colloidal systems with hard interactions  @xcite so that , at least in principle , actual experiments using this system are possible .",
    "finally , a hard disk simulation is relatively cheap to implement and one can make detailed studies of large systems without straining computational resources .",
    "the main outcome of our calculations , the phase diagram , is shown in fig .",
    "[ phfig ] .",
    "we have shown results from our simulation of a system of @xmath1 hard disks ( diameter @xmath2 ) of density @xmath3 and the amplitude of the external potential @xmath4 . within our range of densities ,",
    "one has a clear signature of a re  -entrant liquid phase showing that this phenomenon is indeed a general one as indicated in ref .  .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we specify the model and the simulation method including details of the finite size analysis used . in section iii we present our results for the order parameter and its cumulants with a discussion on finite size and hysteresis effects .",
    "we also present results for the specific heat , order parameter susceptiblity and correlation functions which further illustrates the nature of the phase transitions in this system . in section",
    "iv we discuss our work in relation to the existing literature on this subject , summarize and conclude .",
    "we study a system of n hard disks of diameter @xmath2 in a two dimensional box of size @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) interacting with the pair potential @xmath7 between particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 with distance @xmath10 ,    @xmath11    in addition a particle with coordinates @xmath12 is exposed to an external periodic potential of the form : @xmath13 the constant @xmath14 in eq.([field ] ) is chosen such that , for a density @xmath15 , the modulation is commensurate to a triangular lattice of hard disks with nearest neighbor distance @xmath16 : @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ gofig ] ) .",
    "the only parameters which define our system are the reduced density @xmath18 and the reduced potential strength @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is the temperature .",

    "we have used @xmath25 to denote averages in subsystems .",
    "the subsystems are of size @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are chosen as @xmath29 and @xmath30 consistent with the geometry of the triangular lattice .",
    "most of the simulations described below have been done for @xmath31 particles unless otherwise indicated .",
    "phase transitions have been studied in most cases by starting in the ordered solid and reducing @xmath23 for fixed @xmath32 .",
    "runs where the density @xmath23 is increased were also performed in a few cases .",
    "a typical simulation run with 4 @xmath33 @xmath34 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) ( including 1.5 @xmath35 mcs for relaxation ) took about 50 cpu hours on a pii/500 mhz pc . at high values of @xmath32 in addition to ordinary ( local ) mc moves we also used ` through - moves ' , by which particle placements in neighboring troughs are tried .",
    "besides producing faster equilibration , including such moves ensures that the formation of dislocations for large @xmath32 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are not artificially hindered since particles can bypass each other  this is impossible with purely local mc moves .    to guarantee good equilibration and averaging , we simulated only systems up to n=1600 particles in the region of the phase boundary .",
    "systems of n=4096 and n=16384 were used only once in fig .",
    "[ sphfig ] , where the interesting region is clearly in the liquid phase and equilibration is much easier .",
    "the nature of the fluid - solid phase transition in two dimensions has been a topic of controversy throughout the last forty years  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that true long range positional order is absent in the infinitely large system due to low energy long wavelength excitations so that translational correlations decay algebraically . according to the dislocation unbinding mechanism  @xcite the two dimensional solid ( with quasi long ranged positional order )",
    "first melts into a `` hexatic '' phase with no positional order but with quasi long ranged orientational order signified by a non  -zero bond orientational order parameter @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the angle of a bond and the sum is over all distinct bonds .",
    "a liquid , with no bond orientational order either ( @xmath40 ) is produced by a second kosterlitz  -thouless ( kt )  @xcite transition from the hexatic .    in an external periodic field given by eq.([field ] ) , however , the bond orientational order parameter is non  -zero even in the fluid phase  @xcite .",
    "this is because for @xmath41 we have now a `` modulated '' liquid , in which local hexagons consisting of the six nearest neighbors of a particle are automatically oriented by the external field .",
    "thus @xmath42 is non  -zero both in the ( modulated ) liquid and the crystalline phase and it can not be used to study phase transitions in this system .",
    "the order parameters corresponding to a solid phase are the fourier components of the ( non  -uniform ) density @xmath43 calculated at the reciprocal lattice points @xmath44 .",
    "this ( infinite ) set of numbers are all zero ( for @xmath45 ) in an uniform liquid phase and non  -zero in a solid .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the star consisting of the six smallest reciprocal lattice vectors of the two  -dimensional triangular lattice . in the modulated liquid phase that is relevant to our system , the fourier components corresponding to two out of these six vectors , viz .",
    "those in the direction perpendicular to the troughs of the external potential , are non  -zero  @xcite .",
    "the other four components of this set consisting of those in the direction @xmath46 ( as defined for the ideal crystal in fig .",
    "[ gofig ] ) , and those equivalent to it by symmetry , are zero in the ( modulated ) liquid and non  -zero in the solid ( if there is true long range order ) .",
    "we therefore use the following order parameter : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the position vector of the @xmath49 particle . note that though the order parameter @xmath50 decays to zero with increasing system size in the 2  -d solid  quasi long ranged order  this decay , being weak , does not hinder us from distinguishing , in a finite system , a modulated liquid from the solid phase with positional order in the @xmath46 direction .",
    "we have determined phase transition points by the order parameter cumulant intersection method  @xcite .",
    "the fourth order cumulant @xmath51 of the order parameter distribution is given by : @xmath52 in case of a continuous transition close to the transition point the cumulant is only a function of the ratio of the system size @xmath53 and the correlation length @xmath54 : @xmath55 . since @xmath54 diverges at the critical point the cumulants for different",
    "system sizes intersect in one point : @xmath56 . even for first order transitions these cumulants intersect  @xcite though",
    "the value @xmath57 of @xmath51 at the intersection is not universal any more .",
    "the intersection point can , therefore , be taken as the phase boundary regardless of the order of the transition .",
    "this is useful since the order of the melting transition in @xmath0 either in the absence  @xcite or with  @xcite external potentials is not unequivocally settled .    in order to map the phase diagram we systematically vary the system parameters @xmath32 and @xmath23 to detect order parameter cumulant intersection points which are then identified with the phase boundary .",
    "it should be noted that though the order parameter ( defined for long range positional order ) vanishes  @xcite with increasing system size in the crystalline phase , its cumulants are well defined and can be used to determine phase boundaries . for large",
    "@xmath58 the cumulants approach the value 2/3 in the solid phase and 1/3 in the liquid  @xcite so that they are guaranteed to intersect  ! for very large @xmath32 we do not find an unique point of intersection for @xmath51 , instead the cumulants for various values of @xmath58 collapse onto a single curve . in this case",
    "the onset of the collapse is taken as the `` intersection '' density .",
    "it is curious to note that this behaviour is , in fact , typical of the anisotropic xy model  @xcite . in this case",
    "although the order parameter cumulants have an intersection point , the value of the cumulant at the intersection differs for various anisotropies and drifts towards a limiting value at zero anisotropy .",
    "the intersection `` point '' therefore changes to a `` line '' of intersections for different system sizes and for small anisotropies . in our system , for the large @xmath32 we see similar behaviour .",
    "in fig .  [ opfig ]",
    "we present data for the average order parameter @xmath50 and its cumulants as functions of the density for @xmath59 and @xmath60 calculated within various subsystems . in both cases @xmath61 and @xmath51 increase with @xmath23 with a sharpening of the structures for increasing @xmath58 . as discussed above",
    ", we observe that for any density increasing subsystem size @xmath58 depresses @xmath61 .",
    "the cumulant @xmath51 , on the other hand , approaches limiting values ( 2/3 for solid and 1/3 for liquid ) .",
    "the values of the cumulants are higher for larger @xmath58 in the ordered ( solid ) phase and vice versa in the disordered ( modulated liquid ) phase thus resulting in an intersection point  the transition density .    in fig .",

    "is shifted to lower densities and then for even larger @xmath32 values to higher densities .",
    "this indicates , already , that the system prefers having smaller transition densities for intermediate values of @xmath32 compared to smaller and higher @xmath32 values  i.e. we have a re  -entrant transition .    in fig .",

    "[ op3fig](b ) ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is increased to @xmath65 the value of the cumulant at intersection @xmath57 is shifted upwards , see fig .",

    "[ op5fig ] we show @xmath50 as a function of the density with @xmath66 for different @xmath67-values .",
    "the general features of @xmath50 as discussed above is retained though there is a shift of the turning point to slightly higher densities with increasing @xmath67 . the effect on the phase diagram",
    "is discussed in section  [ phd ] .",
    "in addition to @xmath61 and @xmath51 we have computed the order parameter susceptibility @xmath68 and the specific heat for different system- and subsystem - sizes .",
    "the order parameter susceptibility @xmath68 is defined as @xcite : @xmath69\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ susfig](a ) we show @xmath68 as a function of @xmath23 at @xmath59 for different @xmath58- values .",
    "the increase of @xmath68 with increasing @xmath58 signals the presence of a phase transition in the density range where the transition has been found by cumulant intersection techniques ( @xmath70 ) . in fig .",
    "[ susfig](b ) @xmath68 is shown for the same system size ( @xmath31 ) and various @xmath32-values .",
    "we note that the density of the @xmath68- maxima are smallest for the intermediate value of @xmath32 which again show that for these @xmath32- values the transition density is lowest .",
    "compared to the cumulant intersection values , @xmath68 maxima are located at slightly smaller densities ( see also section  [ phd ] ) which may be due to finite size effects , which often show the feature that phase transition points in finite systems are shifted to slightly different values depending on the observable under investigation . in particular",
    "one expects ( and we get ) a shift towards parameter values in the disordered region ( here a liquid , i.e. low densities ) for the order parameter and the susceptibility as compared to the cumulant intersection parameters .",
    "we have also calculated the specific heat @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ sphfig ] ) as a function of the density for @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "for a second order transition , the maximum of the specific heat scales with the system size as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are critical exponents . for a first order transition , on the other hand @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the dimensionality ( @xmath80 in our case ) .",
    "we , however , do not see any of this behaviour .",
    "in contrast , the specific heat is relatively featureless .",
    "although it shows a peak , surprisingly , the height of this peak is almost insensitive to system size .",
    "this is a strong indication that the phase transition we observe is unconventional and is kt like  @xcite .",
    "further , as expected for such transitions , the maximum does not lie at the density where the cumulants intersect and it would be incorrect to identify specific heat maxima with the phase boundary ( see discussion in section [ concl ] ) .    in order to study the effect of the path taken through the parameter space on the location of the cumulant intersection densities , we compared @xmath51 as a function of the density for @xmath66 as obtained from two runs . in fig .",
    "[ opfig](d ) we have already presented the data for a run where the density was decreased systematically . in fig .",
    "[ ucomfig ] we present data for a second run where the density was _ increased _ instead .",
    "we find negligibly small hysteresis effects on the cumulants as well as on the value of intersection density .",
    "this shows that the transition points are not affected much by the path through the parameter space .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram of the system for @xmath81 and @xmath82 . for each density and @xmath32- value",
    "we computed cumulants @xmath51 for a range of subsystem sizes @xmath58 and located intersection points which we identify with the phase boundary .",
    "the resulting locus of the transition points is shown in the phase diagram , see fig .",
    "[ phfig ] . at very small values of @xmath32",
    "we find good agreement of our transition densities with the melting densities ( @xmath83 ) known from literature  @xcite on the pure hard disk solid ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the values of the transition density initially drop and subsequently rise as @xmath32 increases .",
    "the minimum transition density is found for @xmath85 .",
    "these transition points separate a high density solid from a low density modulated liquid .",
    "thus , at a properly chosen density , we observe an initial freezing transition followed by a re  -entrant melting at a higher @xmath32- value .",
    "such an effect had been found earlier in experiments on colloidal systems in an external laser field  @xcite .    in order to quantify finite size effects on the phase diagram ,",
    "we have computed the transition points for different system sizes .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ ph2fig ] .",
    "we note that due to residual finite size effects with increasing system size all transition points are slightly shifted to higher densities , the structure of the phase diagram with a pronounced minimum at intermediate values of @xmath32 is not affected by this shift .",
    "the debye - waller- correlation function is defined as follows :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 points to the elementary cell of the ideal lattice , and @xmath88 is the deviation of the actual particle position from the ideal lattice : @xmath89 . in this case we have chosen the direction of @xmath87 to lie along the @xmath90 axis ( i.e. along the troughs of the potential ) .",

    "the exponent @xmath99 is predicted  @xcite to be universal and equal to @xmath101 for our geometry , so this value is consistent with our numerical results .",
    "we next try to determine the order of the phase transitions encountered in this system for various values of @xmath102 . in order to investigate this issue we studied the scaling behavior of the order parameter , susceptibility and the order parameter cumulant near the phase boundary for a small ( @xmath103 ) and a large ( @xmath104 ) @xmath105 . from finite size scaling theory ( for an overview see ref .",

    "in contrast to earlier simulations  @xcite which used either the jump of the order parameter , or specific heat maxima to locate the phase transition , we have used the more reliable cumulant intersection method . it must be noted that the specific heat in this system does not show a strong peak at the phase transition density so that its use may lead to confusing results .",
    "this , in our opinion , may be the reason for part of the controversy in this field .",

    "we have shown that finite size scaling of the order parameter cumulants as obtained from sub - system or sub - block analysis , on the other hand , yields an accurate phase diagram .    what is the order of the phase transition ?",
    "we know that  @xcite for the pure hard disk system in two  -dimensions this question is quite difficult to answer and our present understanding  @xcite is that hard disks in two dimensions show a kthny transition .",
    "this transition , however , lies very close ( in an appropriately expanded parameter space ) to a first order boundary so that crossover effects may be significant .",
    "the present system has an imposed external periodic potential which stabilizes the hexatic phase  @xcite and an ( anisotropic ) kt transition  @xcite is expected .",
    "our results show several features which suggest that this is , perhaps , what we have . though we have discussed these observations in the rest of the paper , we list them below for clarity :    * the behaviour of the value of the cumulants at intersection @xmath57 is similar to an earlier work  @xcite on the anisotropic xy system which shows a kt transition . *",

    "<S> the nature of freezing and melting transitions for a system of hard disks in a spatially periodic external potential is studied using extensive monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> detailed finite size scaling analysis of various thermodynamic quantities like the order parameter , its cumulants etc . are used to map the phase diagram of the system for various values of the density and the amplitude of the external potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear indication of a re  -entrant liquid phase over a significant region of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations therefore show that the system of hard disks behaves in a fashion similar to charge stabilized colloids which are known to undergo an initial freezing , followed by a re  -melting transition as the amplitude of the imposed , modulating field produced by crossed laser beams is steadily increased . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of our data shows several features consistent with a recent dislocation unbinding theory of laser induced melting . </S>"
