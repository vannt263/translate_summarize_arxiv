    "early - type dwarf - elliptical ( de ) galaxies are a class of diffuse , low luminosity , low surface brightness galaxies with luminosities in the range @xmath7 mag , and colors typically near @xmath8@xmath9 mag .",
    "they are characterized by smooth surface brightness profiles , and the non - nucleated des are well described by a single exponential or a modified - exponential profile ( e.g. , ichikawa , wakamatsu & okamura 1986 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; cellone , forte & geisler 1994 ) .",
    "color gradients are observed in some de galaxies , yet there does not appear to be any preference for red or blue color gradients ( caldwell & bothun 1987 ; vader et al . 1988 ; cellone et al .",
    "1994 ; durrell 1996 ) .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies appear to be dominated by extensive dark - matter halos , with a mass - to - light ratio that varies as @xmath10 ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , consistent with the models of dekel and silk ( 1986 ) . with a typical mass on",
    "the order of @xmath11 , de galaxies may be the evolved state of primeval protogalactic fragments , the first self - gravitating systems formed in a cdm cosmology ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; larson 1985 ) .",
    "while the formation of de galaxies is not completely understood , the review by ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) provides an excellent overview of this field .    in a recent simulation , moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) illustrated that a large fraction of a cluster s de galaxy population can arise as remnants of late - type galaxies , which are harrassed as they infall to the cluster . in these simulations ,",
    "the primary infalling galaxy is tidally disrupted and stripped by the mean cluster field and by encounters with individual cluster galaxies .",
    "the result is one primary de galaxy ( corresponding to the remnant core of the late - type galaxy ) , with the possibility that additional bound stellar systems ( presumably dwarf galaxies ) can form in the tidally - stripped galaxy debris . in comparison , traditional formation scenarios relevant to de galaxies in a cluster environment assume that they are primeval , and attribute their observed characteristics to an interdependence between _ external _ and _ internal _ factors . for a dense environment such as the coma cluster , the dominant external factors would include : a confinement pressure exerted by the intracluster medium , ram - pressure stripping of galactic gas due to motions through the intergalactic medium , and tidal destruction of low - mass de galaxies in the dense cluster core . the internal factors relevant to de galaxy formation include extensive dark - matter halos , and an expulsion of residual gas via supernovae - driven winds ( e.g. wyse & silk 1985 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; silk , wyse & shields 1987 ; babul & rees 1992 ; marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ) .",
    "the combined result is expected to be a single major star formation epoch , a stellar population similar in age and integrated light to globular clusters , with a galaxy mass and metallicity dependent upon location with respect to the cluster center .    the coma cluster ( e.g. , thompson & gregory 1993 ; colless & dunn 1996 ) is the nearest of the very rich abell clusters ( @xmath12 km / sec , abell richness class 2 ) , and the core of this dense environment provides an excellent location in which to study the properties of de galaxies .",
    "an analysis of the photometric colors of de galaxies can provide valuable insights into the properties of individual galaxies , and can also reveal statistical correlations for populations of galaxies ( caldwell & bothun 1987 ; evans , davies & phillipps , 1990 ; garilli et al . 1992 ; cellone et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this letter",
    ", the distribution of @xmath8@xmath13 color for individual de galaxies is analyzed as a function of their clustercentric radius , and a significant radial gradient in this color is detected .",
    "this new finding is then discussed in the context of de galaxy formation and evolution in a gas - rich , ultra - dense environment such as the coma cluster .",
    "the data sample used here is a subset of the full data sample presented in secker ( 1995 ; 1996 ) and secker & harris ( 1996=sh96 ) .",
    "briefly , a @xmath14 arcmin@xmath15 region of the coma cluster core was mosaic - imaged in two colors ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) with the kpno 4 m , in 1.11.3 arcsec seeing .",
    "the three cluster fields considered here together span a range in clustercentric radius of @xmath18 arcmin , with 1 arcmin @xmath19 kpc .",
    "@xmath16-band magnitudes were derived with kron s @xmath20 aperture ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "1994 ) , and corrected to true total magnitudes with simulations ( secker 1996 ; 1996 ) .",
    "constant aperture magnitudes ( @xmath21 kpc ) were used to calculate accurate ( @xmath17@xmath16 ) colors , prior to which the seeing was matched between the corresponding @xmath16 and @xmath17 images .",
    "our cluster membership is based upon the object s @xmath8@xmath13 color : the de galaxy population is clearly evident on a @xmath16 , @xmath8@xmath13 color - magnitude diagram as a narrow sequence not present on the control field ( sh96 ) . as illustrated by biviano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and sh96 , this technique enormously reduces contamination due to background galaxies . in this letter ,",
    "i restrict the analysis to objects in the de color range @xmath22@xmath23 mag , while in magnitude , the sample is restricted to the range @xmath24 mag .",
    "( a value of @xmath25 gives a distance modulus of 34.9 , for which @xmath26 mag corresponds to @xmath27 mag , an upper limit for de galaxies . ) above @xmath28 mag , de galaxies are clearly resolved as nonstellar , and all stellar objects have been excluded . in this color and magnitude range",
    "there are 340 objects on the program field ( dominated by cluster de galaxies ) , compared to 87 objects ( scaled to the same area ) on the control field . at @xmath29 mag , the sample is @xmath30 percent complete in magnitude , and @xmath31 percent complete in color , with a typical color uncertainty of @xmath32 mag .    in figure [ fig1 ] , the ( @xmath17@xmath16 ) color for each of the 340 program - field objects is plotted versus the logarithmic projected clustercentric radius , adopting ngc 4874 as the cluster center .",
    "superimposed upon the scatterplot of figure [ fig1 ] are larger solid circles representing the trimmed mean @xmath8@xmath13 color in two arcmin radial annuli , plotted at the geometric mean radius of the bin .",
    "the uncertainty estimates on these points correspond to the standard error of the mean .",
    "initially evident in figure [ fig1 ] is the trend for decreasing mean color with increasing radius , though obscured to some degree by the scatter in the binned values .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig1 ] is the result of a weighted least - squares fit to the mean ( @xmath17@xmath16 ) colors .",
    "the slope and intercept for this regression line are given by @xmath1@xmath33 and @xmath8@xmath34 mag at @xmath35 arcmin .",
    "this is a radial color gradient , significant at the four sigma level , which corresponds to a decrease of @xmath36 mag in the mean color of de galaxies over the radial range @xmath18 arcmin . _",
    "thus , we detect a significant gradient in the distribution of galaxy color versus projected clustercentric radius , which works in the sense that de galaxies at smaller clustercentric radii are redder in the mean . _    the @xmath8@xmath13 color index , like @xmath8@xmath37 and the washington @xmath38@xmath39 color , is a sensitive and accurate estimator of the total heavy element abundance ( metallicity ) for old stellar populations ( geisler & forte 1990 ; couture , harris & allwright 1991 ; secker et al .",
    "several of the local group dwarfs show evidence for more than one episode of star formation ( e.g. , caldwell & bothun 1987 ; sarajedini & layden 1995 ; smecker - hane , stetson & hesser 1995 ) , and this may be true for a fraction of the early - type de galaxies located in the environment of rich clusters . however , it is a fair assumption that the majority of these cluster de galaxies are composed of a metal - poor stellar population , similar in age to globular clusters ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "while both age and metallicity affect absorption features in the spectra ( and therefore the integrated color ) for systems of old stars , the effect of metal abundance dominates over age effects in the observed @xmath8@xmath13 color ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "as well , changes in the integrated color induced by starbursts are short lived ( about @xmath40 years ) , after which the integrated colors return to normal ( charlot & silk 1994 ) .",
    "thus in this sample of coma cluster de galaxies , i assume that the redder de galaxies are more metal rich than the bluer de galaxies .    in order to quantify this metallicity scale ,",
    "i adopt a color - metallicity relationship derived from metallicities and integrated @xmath8@xmath41 colors for 82 galactic globular clusters ( from harris 1996 ) , given by [ fe / h]@xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "this color - metallicity relationship is calibrated over the range @xmath44@xmath45 mag , which i linearly extrapolate to @xmath8@xmath13 = 1.6 mag . in this analysis ,",
    "the observed @xmath8@xmath13 colors are used , uncorrected for a foreground reddening of @xmath46 mag .",
    "combined uncertainties in the photometric calibration , reddening and the metallicity calibration give rise to typical external uncertainties for [ fe / h ] on the order of 0.2 dex .    the right - side axis of figure [ fig1 ] labels this metallicity scale , valid for the 340 program - field objects and the mean values in the radial annuli .",
    "in terms of metallicity , the slope and intercept of the regression line are given by @xmath47[fe / h]@xmath48 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath49 dex at @xmath50 arcmin .",
    "this slope indicates a significant radial metallicity gradient , which goes as @xmath51 .",
    "_ thus , for the population of bright de galaxies in the coma cluster core , de galaxies closer to the cluster center are more metal rich in the mean . _ considering the extreme nature of the environment in which these de galaxies formed and have evolved , a metallicity near [ fe / h]@xmath52 dex for the most luminous des is not inconceivable .",
    "is this detected radial metallicity gradient a manifestation of primordial differences in the de galaxies ( a result of their location within the cluster ) , or is this gradient due to an effect of different origin ?",
    "the primary factor to be considered is the presence of intracluster dust . in 1993 , ferguson examined the relation between the mg@xmath53 index and @xmath8@xmath54 colors for elliptical galaxies : he determined that there is a measurable quantity of dust in the coma intracluster medium , and estimated @xmath55 mag , such that @xmath56 mag . via simulations , he determined that a king model with a core radius of 0.5 mpc was plausible for the dust distribution . assuming @xmath57 mag at the cluster center",
    ", one would estimate a total @xmath58 mag out to the core radius .",
    "our data spans nearly the same radial range , and from the analysis of the projected radial color distribution we estimate @xmath1@xmath59 mag .",
    "thus , while the intracluster dust may contribute significantly to our radial color gradient , it can not be the sole cause of the observed color gradient .    as detected by sh96 , there exists a strong color - luminosity correlation in this same data set , which works in the sense that the more luminous de galaxies are redder ( in the mean ) ; the detected color gradient therefore also corresponds to a luminosity gradient .",
    "thus , we may question whether any mass - dependent dynamical relaxation of the de galaxy orbits could have occurred . for de galaxies in a rich cluster environment , both two - body relaxation and dynamical friction occur over a timescale much greater than the hubble time ( bahcall 1977 ; merritt 1985 ) .",
    "west & richstone ( 1988 ) proposed that in a cluster containing dark matter , violent relaxation occurring during cluster collapse can result in spatial segregation between the luminous galaxies and the dark matter .",
    "however , their simulations show no clear evidence for segregation between galaxies of the smallest and intermediate masses .",
    "thus the color distribution which we observe must be primordial in nature .",
    "figure 1 shows de galaxy color plotted against _ projected clustercentric radius_. assuming that there is a color / metallicity gradient in three dimensions for a centrally - concentrated galaxy cluster , what is the effect of projection to two dimensions ?",
    "specifically , projection will introduce significant scatter about the mean color , with this scatter increasing towards the cluster center .",
    "since the mean value of the projected distribution involves a summation along the line of sight , this increased scatter skews the mean projected color in a biased manner , which results in a measured color gradient which is shallower that the true gradient .",
    "it is useful to explore simulated galaxy clusters for which the galaxy color varies with the true ( i.e. , three - dimensional ) clustercentric radius @xmath60 , and by doing so determine what true color distribution gives rise to the observed radial color gradient in the projected distribution .",
    "the simulations performed here are based upon spherically - symmetric king model galaxy clusters , with the true spatial distribution of cluster galaxies over a radial range of @xmath61 mpc described by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 arcmin .",
    "the colors assigned to cluster members were based solely upon their true radius @xmath60 , as described below . to this",
    "was added a population of uniformly - distributed ( control - field ) objects , whose colors were selected randomly and uniformly throughout the interval considered here .    this simulated galaxy cluster and background population",
    "were then projected to two dimensions ( figure 2 ) , such that within the radial range being considered , there were 255 cluster galaxies ( small solid circles ) and 72 control - field objects ( crosses ) .",
    "then , as was done for figure 1 , the distribution of mean object color as a function of projected clustercentric radii were analyzed for the sample of 327 simulated objects . for the model illustrated in figure 2 ,",
    "the color distribution is given by @xmath8@xmath64 .",
    "the last term represents the model s scatter in color at any @xmath60 ; it is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.05 mag . to obtain the closest match to the observed distribution",
    ", the true color distribution was varied between simulations ; the slope and intercept of the least - squares regression line in figure 2 are equal to the values obtained for the de galaxy sample of section 2 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "while this color distribution function is a reasonable one , it is not necessarily unique , and a different set of input parameters may well yield a similar result for the projected radial gradient .    while the distribution of the simulated objects in figure 2 is not an exact match to the observed objects in figure 1 ,",
    "the simulated cluster set is sufficiently similar to reveal the following about the nature of the de galaxy population in the coma cluster .",
    "first , the slope of the projected radial color gradient , @xmath1@xmath65 , corresponds to a much steeper slope in the true galaxy distribution , @xmath1@xmath66 , or @xmath6 .",
    "second , the total color change of @xmath1@xmath67 mag for the projected distribution corresponds to a color change of @xmath1@xmath68 mag , or @xmath47[fe / h]@xmath69 dex , in the true distribution , over the ( same ) observed radial range .",
    "while our simulated cluster reproduces the main features of the observed de galaxy color - projected radius distribution very well , there are noticeable differences between figures 1 and 2 .",
    "although the dominate effect is due to projection , there are secondary effects which will add further second - order scatter : deviations of the coma cluster from spherical symmetry , motions of individual galaxies from their primeval location , variations in the level of preenrichment between galaxy cluster subclumps , and variations in the density of the intracluster medium ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "these secondary effects were not included in our simulation .      any successful model for the formation of de galaxies in a cluster environment , regardless of the mechanism or epoch , must naturally account for the radial metallicity gradient described in the previous section .",
    "the `` late- accretion '' model of silk , wyse & shields ( 1987=sws87 ) postulates that the intracluster gas was enriched by the metal - rich gas outflows from des at an early epoch ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) . then during the epoch of cluster formation ,",
    "this diffuse gas is compressed and cools , subsequently infalling and accreting onto the halos of the most massive dwarf galaxies ; vigorous starbursts can then follow .",
    "assume that the star formation within a dwarf galaxy is governed by the gas accretion rate , which is regulated by the proximity of the dwarf galaxy to a more massive companion ; i.e. , the tidal field of a large central galaxy effectively strips gas from the nearest dwarf galaxies , such that the star formation rate decreases towards the cluster center .",
    "the sws87 model is applicable to dwarf galaxies in a cluster environment , and it describes a transition from de galaxies to dir galaxies during the present epoch of galaxy cluster formation . they also postulate that this accretion mechanism could supply the gas necessary for star formation in the nucleus of the more massive de galaxies , thus explaining the presence of a nucleus in the brighter de galaxies . if this is indeed the case , an observable metallicity gradient within the de , n galaxy population would ensue , with those further from the cluster center being more metal rich in the mean .",
    "the sample of 340 objects that are analyzed above includes all detected de galaxies in the absolute magnitude range @xmath71 mag . within this magnitude range , and within our sample",
    ", we expect the fraction n(de , n)/n(de ) to vary from nearly 100 percent for the brightest down to 20 or 30 percent for the fainter dwarfs ( van den bergh 1986 ) ; that is , the sample of bright de galaxies will be dominated by nucleated de galaxies .",
    "if these de , n galaxies result from this late accretion , sws87 predict that a positive radial metallicity gradient would be observed , which is not consistent with the radial metallicity gradient we detect .",
    "the model introduced by babul & rees ( 1992=br92 ) naturally explains the observed negative metallicity gradient .",
    "br92 postulate that the intracluster medium ( icm ) played a dominant role in the evolution of dwarf galaxies , as an external pressure which confined the supernova - driven gas , preventing gas loss in a way that the dark halos themselves could not .",
    "br92 postulate that if this icm pressure dominated over the counter - effect of ram - pressure stripping , it could halt the outflow of metal - rich gas from the young des .",
    "this metal - rich gas would then cool and fall back onto the galaxy core ; this gas would then be available for subsequent star bursts .",
    "they attribute the paucity of field de galaxies at the present time to the lack of confinement pressure ; the field de galaxies more easily expelled their gas , inhibiting further star formation , and have subsequently faded away . in fact ,",
    "br92 and babul & ferguson ( 1996 ) have proposed that the faint blue galaxies ( e.g. , koo & kron 1992 ) are a field population of star - bursting de galaxies at redshifts @xmath72 , which will subsequently fade .",
    "this icm is an integral component of rich galaxy clusters like coma , and while it is diffuse ( i.e. , @xmath73@xmath74 @xmath75 in the core ) , the total mass of the icm is comparable to the total mass in luminous matter throughout the cluster . with a temperature near @xmath76@xmath77 k ( fabian et al . 1994 ) , the icm pressure in the cluster core is on the order of @xmath78 @xmath75 k , sufficient to confine the outflowing gas within the dark - matter halos of the de galaxies .",
    "thus the dense core of the coma cluster provides an excellent laboratory in which to study the effects of variation in the density of the icm on de galaxy metallicity . following the logic of br92 , and since the icm density peaks in the cluster core near ngc 4874 ( white , briel & henry 1993 )",
    ", the des nearest to the cluster center should be on average both _ more massive _ and _ more metal rich _ , than des farther from the cluster core .",
    "thus the detection of a negative radial metallicity gradient within the de galaxy population of the coma cluster core is consistent with the model of br92 .",
