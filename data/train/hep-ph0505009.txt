    "<S> we study the matter effects to neutrino oscillations @xmath0 and @xmath1 at very long baselines . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the variations of cp violating phase and the solar neutrino mixing parameters have negligible effects on @xmath6 and @xmath7 for such a long baseline . </S>",

    "<S> the scenario of @xmath16 oscillation for atmospheric neutrinos has been confirmed by the k2k experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the results in the solar neutrino oscillation measurements are also confirmed by kamland reactor measurements @xcite . combining these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem is established and the updated @xmath17 parameter ranges are given by @xcite @xmath18 with the best fit values @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    despite the achievements so far in measuring the neutrino mixing parameters , the sign of @xmath5 , the mixing angle @xmath8 and the cp violating parameter @xmath21 in the mixing matrix remain to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of @xmath22 can be determined through matter effects to @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) oscillations in the very long baseline experiments @xcite . however , such oscillations are sensitive to the mixing angle @xmath8 , which has been constrained by the reactor experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the chooz experiment @xcite gives a more stringent constraint on @xmath8 with @xmath27 for a large @xmath22 ( 90% c.l . ) . </S>",

    "<S> a smaller @xmath45 requires an even larger oscillation length . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , to take a full advantage of the matter enhancement , one is led to consider experiments with a baseline of the order of the earth diameter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that the matter effects to @xmath46 and @xmath47 can also be significant in the vicinity of @xmath6 s resonance peak @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the criterion for the maximal matter effect to @xmath48 is identified to be @xmath49 where the former is the resonance energy for the oscillation @xmath6 while the latter is the energy that the vacuum approximation of @xmath48 attains its peak value . </S>",
    "<S> such a criterion amounts to @xcite @xmath50 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath51 km , while , for @xmath52 with the same @xmath45 value , @xmath53 km . in the latter case , @xmath48 is decreased from its vacuum oscillation value by as much as @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the muon neutrino survival probability @xmath7 also receives significant matter effects in the same energy range .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the matter effect to @xmath6 and that to @xmath7 are both significant in the same energy range for baselines of the order @xmath55 km . </S>",
    "<S> hence simultaneous measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in such a baseline provide a stringent test on the matter effect , which is the focus of this work . to discuss these oscillations , we begin with the relation connecting flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . for the dirac type cp - phase @xmath21 , we allow its value ranging from 0 to 2@xmath63 . the evolutions of neutrino flavor eigenstates are governed by the equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the mass - squared difference between the @xmath67-th and @xmath68-th mass eigenstates , and @xmath69 is the effective potential arising from the charged current interaction between @xmath70 and electrons in the medium with @xmath71 the electron number density . </S>",

    "<S> the matter effect to @xmath7 can also be tested in other parameter regions . </S>",
    "<S> this is true when values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are accurately measured in other future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> there are extensive discussions on measuring @xmath8 in reactor neutrino experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the issue of determining @xmath9 in the three - flavor oscillation framework has also been discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that @xmath117 can be measured to an @xmath118 accuracy in the j - parc@xmath119 super - kamiokande ( jparc - sk ) experiment @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , provided @xmath45 is accurately measured by the reactor experiment @xcite , say around @xmath122 at @xmath29 c.l . according to the analysis in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given the future accuracies for determining @xmath121 and @xmath45 , it is possible to identify the matter effect in the muon survival probability @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for illustration , let us assume , for example , @xmath11 and @xmath7 are measured to be @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively in the very long baseline experiment , with some uncertainties understood for each measurement . </S>",

    "<S> hence the matter effect to @xmath7 can in principle be identified by the extracted value of @xmath94 , provided there are sufficient accuracies in the measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . furthermore , we note that @xmath130 with the matter effect to @xmath7 taken into account while @xmath131 without the matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> the difference on the extracted value of @xmath121 is about @xmath132 , which is also larger than the expected @xmath120 uncertainty in determining @xmath121 by the jparc - sk experiment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if one can accurately measure @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the matter effects to @xmath7 can also be identified through the extracted value of @xmath121 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have discussed the matter effects to @xmath133 oscillations at very long baselines . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these effects with a baseline @xmath79 km , the distance between fermilab and kamioka . around this baseline length , </S>",
    "<S> the matter effects to @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both significant near the resonance energy for @xmath10 oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we have worked out in detail the dependencies of these probabilities on the mixing angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath22 taken to be @xmath134 ev@xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that these probabilities are not sensitive to the variations of other neutrino oscillation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified the parameter space in the @xmath94-@xmath98 plane in which the matter effect to @xmath7 can be most easily identified . </S>",
    "<S> we also argued that it is possible to identify the same matter effect in the remaining parameter space provided @xmath8 and @xmath9 are accurately measured in other future neutrino experiments . </S>"
