    "spectropolarimetry is a very powerful diagnostic technique . it has allowed us to study in depth the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the solar and stellar plasmas . however , the valuable information encoded in the stokes profiles is often difficult to extract .",
    "the response of the spectral shape of a given spectral line to changes of the properties of the plasma is very convoluted , non - linear and , in many occasions , non - local .    in spite of the complex relation between the physical parameters and the emergent stokes profiles ,",
    "several simple diagnostic tools have been developed in the past and are still under wide use in solar physics . among them , the line ratio technique @xcite , the center - of - gravity method @xcite and the application of calibration curves between spectral line and magnetic field properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent applications ) have had special relevance .    during the last few decades we have witnessed the development and systematic application of nonlinear inversion codes .",
    "they extract physically relevant information by comparing the observed stokes profiles to those synthesized in appropriate atmospheric models . because of the non - linearity between the physical parameters and the observables , these inversion methods make use of elaborate time - consuming non - linear optimization methods .",
    "the first heroic ( because of the low computational power available at that time ) efforts made use of relatively simple physical models , of which the milne - eddington ( me ) approximation is the most widely spread ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the simplifying assumptions made by the me approximation may not be fully fulfilled in real solar plasmas , it is still one of the most widely used models , in part , because of its analytical simplicity .",
    "even state - of - the - art inversion codes such as vfisv @xcite , used for inferring magnetic field vectors from the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; onboard the solar dynamics observatory ) data , or as milos @xcite and merlin @xcite , currently applied to data from the hinode spacecraft , are based on this assumption .",
    "the increase in computational power made it feasible to use more elaborate models .",
    "a fundamental leap forward was the application of the idea of response functions @xcite to the inversion of stokes profiles with non - trivial depth stratifications of the physical quantities .",
    "the first representative of this family of codes was sir ( stokes inversion based on response functions ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the presence of gradients along the line - of - sight ( los ) of the physical properties are of importance for explaining the strong asymmetries observed in magnetized regions @xcite . based on the same strategy",
    ", @xcite developed a code capable of dealing with lines in nlte ( non - local thermodynamical equilibrium ) .",
    "this model has been mainly applied for the inversion of ca ii infrared triplet lines , which are formed under strong nlte conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models based on the assumption of microstructured magnetic atmospheres which incorporate small - scale fluctuations of the physical quantities along the los have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "a property of such models is the natural generation of asymmetric profiles , which has been proposed as an alternative to explain the observed asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the history of inversion codes displays an interesting characteristic .",
    "the complexity of the models proposed has increased with time thanks to two factors .",
    "first , the computational power has allowed us to solve the non - linear optimization problem faster .",
    "second , the quality of spectropolarimetric observations has improved with time , with instruments systematically achieving signal - to - noise ratios above 1000 and reaching 10@xmath0 in many cases .",
    "this forces the inversion code to fit minute variations of the shape of the stokes profile . in many cases",
    ", such small modifications of the shape of the profiles are encoding important physical effects .",
    "although counterintuitive , the availability of high - quality observations has also intensified a discussion that has been present from the beginning of the history of inversion codes .",
    "the selection of the model to be used for the inversions is often influenced by subjective reasons .",
    "a model can be chosen deliberately to be simple because of the necessity of inverting large maps as fast as possible .",
    "this is the case of hmi @xcite .",
    "an inversion code based on a given model is sometimes chosen based on the availability of the inversion code and the expertise to use it .",
    "a model might be chosen based on its capability to fit as much detail of the stokes profiles as possible .",
    "sometimes the selection of a model is driven by spatial resolution .",
    "this is the case when there is a clear indication in the spectrum that structures are not resolved .",
    "other possibilities can be invoked , but they sometimes contain a large subjective content .",
    "the choice of the model is also important because it critically affects the interpretation of the inferred parameters .",
    "this is specially relevant for parameters that are more indirectly related to observables , like the magnetic field of non - resolved structures .",
    "there are widespread examples in the literature , especially when signals are weak .",
    "for instance , there has been some controversy regarding the magnetic field strength in the quiet sun inferred from infrared or visible fe i lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , conflicting properties of the magnetic field in internetwork regions of the quiet sun have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite on the one hand , and by @xcite on the other , from the very same hinode observations ( and partially supported with data from ground by * ? ? ?",
    "these discrepancies are only `` apparent '' because they are caused by the application of different modelings when the organization of internetwork magnetic fields is still an unknown .",
    "once we know the nature of the magnetic fields in the quiet sun or , in other words , we have access to the most probable model among all possible ones , the results will be reliable .",
    "this problem does not arise for parameters that are more directly related to observables like bulk velocities , field azimuths , magnetic flux , etc .",
    "this paper does not deal with the actual implementation of particular inversion algorithms and codes , or their respective efficiencies , but with the suitability of the underlying physical models to explain the observations . to this aim",
    "we perform the first fully bayesian comparison of models for the inversion of stokes profiles . to this end",
    ", we analyze a sample of stokes profiles observed with the spectropolarimeter ( sp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard hinode @xcite and with the vector magnetograph imax @xcite onboard the sunrise balloon @xcite .",
    "we discuss , for different cases , the model ( chosen from a pool of fixed models ) that is favored by data and their relative probabilities based on the computation of the evidence .",
    "the evidence is calculated using the bayesian inference code developed by @xcite and recent extensions that we have made to the code to deal with models with gradient .",
    "we apply model selection theory to determine which is the model best suited for explaining the stokes profiles observed in a pixel ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a general description and more details ) .",
    "let s assume we have @xmath1 models @xmath2 competing to explain the same set of observations formally represented by @xmath3 . here , @xmath3 will be represented by a formal vector @xmath4 $ ] whose elements are the values of the stokes parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and/or @xmath8 at certain wavelengths @xmath9 . by a _ model _",
    "we mean an algorithm that depends on a set of @xmath10 parameters @xmath11 ( often , the temperature at one or several points in a model atmosphere ; the magnetic field strength , in clination , and azimuth ; the density , etc ) , whose output is a prediction @xmath12 of the data .",
    "the bayes theorem @xcite states that the posterior probability of each model at the light of the obs erved data is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is our prior belief in each model ( which we will assume to be the same for all the models considered here ; see below ) , while @xmath15 is just a normalization constant : @xmath16 finally , @xmath17 is the evidence or marginal likelihood , which is the key ingredient of our model comparison , and is given by the following integral ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath18 the quantity @xmath19 is the prior distribution for the model parameters . if , for example , we assume that @xmath20 ( i.e. , the @xmath21-th parameter of mode @xmath22 ) is _ a priori _ distributed uniformly between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath25^{-1 } & & \\theta_{i;j}^\\mathrm{min } < \\theta_{i;j } < \\theta_{i;j}^\\mathrm{max } \\\\ 0 & & \\mathrm{otherwise } \\end{array } \\label{eq : prior_uniform } \\right .. \\ ] ] the quantity @xmath26 in eq .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", we will assume our priors to be uniform ( eq . [ eq : prior_uniform ] ) , hence , the evidence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evidence ] ) simply reads : @xmath28   \\int_{\\omega } \\mathrm{d}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_i p(d|{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}_i,\\mathcal{m}_i ) , \\label{eq : evidence_simplified}\\ ] ] where the integral is computed extended over the volume @xmath29 which contains the region where the priors are non - zero .",
    "it is important to note that , if a model parameter is completely unconstrained by the observed data ( so the ensuing likelihood does not depend on this parameter ) , the evidence does not penalize it because it factorizes from the integral",
    ".    given two models , @xmath30 and @xmath31 that are proposed to explain an observation , the ratio of posteriors @xmath32 is used to compute how more probable one model is with respect to the other @xcite .",
    "the ratio of evidences is known as the bayes factor , @xmath33 , and it is trivially given by : @xmath34 if both models are assumed to have the same a - priori probability ( which is what we have assumed in all subsequent computations ) , the ratio of posteriors is just the bayes factor .",
    "large values of @xmath33 indicate a preference for model @xmath30 while small values indicate a preference for model @xmath31 .",
