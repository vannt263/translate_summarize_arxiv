    "when the repumping frequency is tuned to @xmath64 , the photon echo is emitted along the weak transition at frequency @xmath58 in ions in system ( ii ) or ( iv ) . to make sure that the detected signal is imputable to the weak transition ,",
    "we slightly detune the repumping beam : the echo intensity goes down , which proves that the off - resonant repumping is less efficient and that the signal does not come from a residual signal emitted along a strong transition .    the photon echo amplitude can be expressed as a product of the transition dipole moment and a function of the rabi frequency .",
    "this applies to both transitions , either strong or weak . since the rabi frequency is proportional to the transition dipole",
    "moment and to the applied field , the photon echo intensity along the strong transition reads as : @xmath139 where @xmath140 represents the laser intensity and where the shape of function @xmath42 need not be detailed any further .",
    "conversely , when the weak transition is excited with the same intensity @xmath140 , the photon echo intensity reads as @xmath141 where @xmath27 is the branching ratio .    the photon echo intensity @xmath142 on the strong transition is measured for different excitation intensities .",
    "a weighted echo intensity is defined as : @xmath143 this function is interpolated with a polynomial function as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : is ] . if we measure @xmath144 on the weak transition for a given intensity @xmath145 , we are able to derive the branching ratio value by solving the following equation : @xmath146 as shown in fig .  [",

    "[ eq : w ] and  [ eq : implicit ] , the graphical solution of this equation is given by the intersection point of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",

    "the value is directly read out as @xmath152 at the intersection.,width=313 ]      with optical nutation and photon echo experiments we measured two branching ratio values that are in agreement with one another .",
    "as far as theoretical gyromagnetic tensors are concerned , the @xmath153 anisotropy is much larger in the ground state than in the excited state  @xcite .",
    "this difference , known as _ anisotropy disparity _ , is at the origin of the high value for the maximum theoretical branching ratio @xmath47 .",
    "the experimental value of anisotropy disparity appeared to be smaller than predicted by theory  @xcite .",
    "as a result , a branching ratio value close to its lower boundary @xmath154 was expected .",
    "the direct measurements presented in this paper confirm this result .",
    "these measurements have been achieved for the magnetic field orientation ( @xmath155 ) given by de seze _ et al . _",
    "we did not study the dependence of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "however , the branching ratio is almost constant over a @xmath156 wide interval  @xcite",
    ". therefore , even with a @xmath157 mechanical precision on the angle , one can reasonably consider that the measured branching ratio is close to its maximum .    finally , in the experiments presented in sec .",
    "[ nutation ] , the nutation signal along the strong transition goes through its first maximum at @xmath158s .",
    "this means that a @xmath159-pulse along the strong transition would take @xmath160s .",
    "according to the present branching ratio measurements , a @xmath159-pulse along the weak transition would then take @xmath161s",
    ". therefore , we are able to excite each leg of the @xmath0 system with a @xmath159-pulse , which is a capital asset in the perspective of coherent processes dynamics .",
    "we directly measure the transition probability ratio along the two legs of the @xmath0 through coherent processes along with frequency selective optical pumping .",
    "this is performed in the optimum magnetic field orientation derived from a previous experiment  @xcite .",
    "the direct measurement of the branching ratio is consistent with the value derived from the gyromagnetic tensor components and confirms that a @xmath0-system can operate efficiently in tm : yag .",
    "this way we have cross - checked and supported the theoretical description , complementing prior experimental data  @xcite with a new set of data different in nature .",
    "in addition , this provides us with the branching ratio value we have to know in order to efficiently build and control nuclear magnetic superposition states with optical excitation .",
    "side investigation on the sublevel lifetime leads to unexpected results .",
    "indeed , broadly spaced sublevels appear to be more stable than closely spaced ones , in contradiction with previously reported experiments  @xcite .",
    "this has to be clarified .",
    "still , the measured lifetime is consistent with long - time coherent manipulation of spin states .",
    "the demonstrated existence of the @xmath0 system promises interesting spin state properties in either ground or excited level .",
    "next step will deal with the investigation of these coherent spin features .",
