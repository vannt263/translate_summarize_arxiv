    "self - gravitating astrophysical objects are roughly spherically symmetric . if they rotate and/or are in binary systems , however , their shape deviates from spherical symmetry due to centrifugal and/or tidal forces .",
    "the response to such deformations provides us with important information on the matter distribution inside the object .",
    "deviations from spherical symmetry may be characterized by the multipole moments of the gravitational fields outside the body .",
    "the properties of a nonspherical , self - gravitating distribution of matter are then encoded in its multipole moments .",
    "for instance , the spin - induced quadrupole moment encodes information about the deformability of a rotating body , which is related to the stiffness of the matter distribution ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the multipole moments of a neutron star depend in similar ways on its internal structure .",
    "thus , measurements of the first multipole moments can be used to constrain the equation of state of the neutron - star core , which is still unknown at nuclear and the super - nuclear densities .",
    "another interesting application of the multipole moments of compact objects is related to tests of the black - hole no - hair theorems .",
    "astrophysical black holes are fully characterized by only their mass @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath1 , all higher multipole moments being uniquely determined only by these two quantities  @xcite .",
    "thus , independent measurements of at least three multipole moments can be used to distinguish black holes from exotic compact objects or to provide null - hypothesis tests of the kerr metric and of general relativity ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in this context , the lowest - order multipole moments , namely the mass @xmath0 , angular momentum @xmath1 , and quadrupole moment @xmath2 , would play a prime role .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that there exist various approximate relations among the lowest - order multipole moments of compact stars which are only mildly dependent on the equation of state . by considering a reasonable set of equations of state for the neutron - star interior , approximately universal relations between the moment of inertia and",
    "the lowest - order multipole moments have been found ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "more recently , it has been found that , for slightly deformed neutron stars , the moment of inertia @xmath3 , the tidal quadrupole deformability @xmath4 ( the tidal love number ) , and the spin - induced quadrupole moment @xmath2 , also satisfy some universal relations ( dubbed as `` i - love - q '' ) that are nearly independent of the equation of state to within a few percent level  @xcite . here",
    ", the tidal love number @xmath4 is defined as the ratio of the tidally - induced quadrupole moment of a nonspinning star to the strength of the perturbing quadrupolar tidal field .",
    "these nearly universal relations will be helpful to extract physically important quantities from observational data if they exist within the required accuracy .",
    "for example , the i - love - q relations can break degeneracy in the models used for x - ray and gravitational - wave observations of neutron stars .",
    "for these reasons , nearly - universal relations of compact objects have attracted much attention in the last few years .",
    "although the i - love - q relations were originally found  @xcite for slightly deformed , isolated , nonmagnetized compact stars , they have been extended to more general cases , namely dynamical configurations  @xcite , rapid rotation  @xcite , nonbarotropic  @xcite and anisotropic  @xcite fluids , strong magnetic fields  @xcite , and also deviations from general relativity  @xcite .",
    "possible explanations for the emergence of this approximate universality are given in refs .",
    "similar universal relations have been also found among higher - order multipole moments induced by tidal effects for nonrotating neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the rotational love numbers in the i - love - q relations has been also argued in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these universal relations among higher - order multipole moments of a neutron star are reminiscent of the black - hole no - hair theorems , namely they show that only a handful of low - order multipole moments can ( approximately ) characterize the gravitational field of a compact object .    to investigate this problem and to elucidate an origin of the i - love - q relation , it is interesting to understand how the i - love - q relations behave in the black - hole limit",
    ". since the ratio of the mass @xmath0 to the radius @xmath5 ( i.e. , the compactness ) of any standard spherical perfect - fluid star has the upper limit @xmath6 ( in geometrized units , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the compactness of a perfect fluid star is disconnected from that of a black hole , @xmath7 . to examine the black - hole limit of the i - love - q relations ,",
    "therefore , we have to consider somewhat peculiar compact objects that can sustain higher compactness .",
    "yagi and yunes  @xcite have studied this problem using fluid stars with anisotropic pressure . in the models they employed  @xcite , stars with the maximally anisotropic pressure",
    "can approach the black - hole limit continuously , i.e. their compactness can be as high as @xmath8 in the nonrotating case .",
    "they confirmed that the universality of the i - love - q relations hold for stars with weakly anisotropic pressure and that the tidal love number and the quadrupole moment of anisotropic fluid stars continuously approach their corresponding black hole s values as the compactness increases . on the other hand",
    ", they observed that , for strongly anisotropic pressure models , the behavior of the love number and quadrupole moment are quite different from those of standard neutron stars and quark stars .",
    "these peculiar models with strongly anisotropic pressure have negative love number and quadrupole moment , in contrast with the neutron - star case .",
    "a negative value of the spin - induced quadrupole moment basically indicates that the matter distribution of the object is prolate .",
    "indeed , yagi and yunes observed that the rotating stars with strongly anisotropic pressure become prolate despite of the centrifugal force , due to a strongly anisotropic pressure  @xcite .",
    "similar results have been also obtained for another peculiar compact star model , namely for thin - shell gravastars .",
    "the original gravastar model has been proposed by mazur and mottola  @xcite as an alternative to the final state of the stellar evolution of very massive stars , whose collapse would form a black hole in the standard scenario . the thin - shell gravastar model is a simplified version of the original gravastar and is composed of a vacuum core with a positive cosmological constant ( de sitter core ) surrounded by an infinitesimally thin shell , which is required to match the interior core to the schwarzschild exterior metric  @xcite .",
    "although this scenario lacks a precise formation mechanism , the de sitter core is assumed to appear through a quantum phase transition in the vicinity of the would - be event horizon during the gravitational collapse of very massive objects .",
    "gravastars are a hypothetical exotic compact objects which can be as compact as black holes but are free from the theoretical problems associated with an event horizon and a spacetime singularity  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of testing the gravastar scenario with electromagnetic and gravitational - wave observations has been recently argued in refs .",
    "some models of thin - shell gravastars are stable against small radial disturbances  @xcite although nonlinear instability might occur for those models whose compactness is larger than @xmath9 ( and therefore possess a light ring )  @xcite and for highly - spinning compact models due to the ergoregion instability  @xcite .",
    "recently , one of us investigated the i - love - q relations for a particular model of thin - shell gravastar in which the energy density of the thin shell vanishes  @xcite . similarly to the case of fluid stars with maximum anisotropic pressure , in this model , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 smoothly connect to their black - hole values as the compactness increases .",
    "furthermore , low - compactness gravastars have negative love number and quadrupole moment and become prolate shaped when rotating . at the same time , by assuming that the equation of state for the thin shell is given by the same form as that given by equilibrium sequences of spherical solutions with fixed values of the gravitational mass , two of us  @xcite have studied rotational effects on a thin - shell gravastar in the absence of an external tidal field .",
    "similarly to the case of gravastars with zero thin - shell energy , we obtained prolate shaped rotating gravastars and showed that some solutions may have the same quadrupole moment of a black hole with same mass and spin .",
    "this implies a confusion problem , namely these particular solutions can not be distinguished from a black hole through independent measurements of their mass , spin and quadrupole moment .",
    "given the plethora of applications related to the multipole moments and the tidal deformability of relativistic compact objects , the motivation for the present study is manifold .",
    "on the one hand , we extend our previous work  @xcite to investigate the universality and the black - hole limit of the i - love - q relations for various thin - shell gravastars with a generic polytropic equation of state for the shell .",
    "we use the hartle - thorne formalism  @xcite , assuming the tidal and rotational effects on the gravastar are sufficiently small , which is a standard assumption to study the tidal love numbers and the spin - induced multipole moment for compact objects  @xcite .",
    "since the thin - shell gravastar is composed of two distinct spacetimes , namely a de sitter core and a schwarzschild exterior in the spherically symmetric case , we need to take account of the junction conditions of spacetime at the thin - shell position , where the two spacetimes are matched together  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "our novel results for the tidal deformability of thin - shell gravastars allow us to investigate the extend to which gravitational - wave observations  @xcite can constrain gravastar models .",
    "tidal effects enter the two - body inspiral gravitational waveforms at high post - newtonian order  @xcite ( cf . , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . because the tidal love numbers of static  @xcite ( and , presumably , also rotating  @xcite ) black holes are identically zero",
    ", any gravitational - wave measurement of a nonvanishing tidal deformability would imply that one of the two objects is not a black hole .",
    "conversely , gravitational - wave observations of compact - binary inspirals  @xcite may be used to put upper bounds on the tidal love number of the two bodies , thus constraining exotic alternatives .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly give the formulation for constructing models of distorted thin - shell gravastars whose small deformation is caused by the centrifugal and the tidal forces , respectively . in sec .",
    "iii , we present numerical results for stationary and static axisymmetric models .",
    "we first construct spherically symmetric , thin - shell gravastars and examine their radial stability , which depends on the equation of state for the thin - shell matter .",
    "next , we present the results for the i - love - q relations of thin - shell gravastars with polytropic equation of state and investigate their black - hole limit . finally , in sec .  iv we discuss how a measurement of the tidal deformability from the gravitational - wave detection of a compact - binary inspiral can be used to constrain models of thin - shell gravastars .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v. in this study , we use geometrized units in which @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the gravitational constant and the speed of light , respectively . note that , as mentioned later",
    ", we employ the symbol `` @xmath13 '' to denote the compactness of the object , i.e. , @xmath14 with @xmath0 and @xmath5 being the mass and radius of the object with spherical symmetry .",
    "thin - shell gravastars can be constructed by matching two distinct spacetimes at the shell location .",
    "as previously discussed , we focus on small deviations from spherically symmetry , which can be investigated by using hartle and thorne s formalism  @xcite . as unperturbed solutions",
    ", we consider a spherically - symmetric thin - shell gravastar  @xcite in which the de sitter and schwarzschild spacetimes are patched together .",
    "we are interested in the dominant quadrupole deformations and , therefore , we do not consider in detail spherically - symmetric perturbations which are also induced by rotation and by the tidal field .    as shown later ,",
    "calculations of physical quantities related to the rotational and tidal deformations of the gravastar are very similar to each other .",
    "the differences appear only in the boundary conditions at infinity and in the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "since the formulation for spin - induced deformations may be reduced to that for the tidal deformations , we first give a concise summary of the master equations governing slowly rotating thin - shell gravastars , as derived in ref .",

    "[ iloveq ] ) .",
    "second , we confirm that the relations approach their corresponding black - hole limit  @xcite as the compactness increases ( or , equivalently , as @xmath226 decreases ) .",
    "this property seems to hold in general , i.e. for all values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 considered in this study .    finally , we observe that the i - love - q relations for thin - shell gravastars substantially depend on the equations of state for the thin shell .",
    "although all curves approach the same black - hole limit , they behave differently for different polytropic indices @xmath136 and even for the same polytropic index but different values of @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , there seems to be no universality in the i - love - q relations for thin - shell gravastars .",
    "however , even in the cases of neutron stars and quark stars the universality does not hold for _ any _ equation of state , but only for a subclass of equations of state which nonetheless comprises the majority of models , ranging from soft to stiff matter .",
    "these models differ at very high densities but are similar near the neutron - star surface , where the behavior of matter is well understood . in the case of thin - shell gravastars , the equation of state changes precisely at the surface and , in this sense",
    ", it is reasonable to expect a different behavior",
    ". it would be interesting to extend our study to the case of finite - thickness gravastars , in order to investigate the region which is ( possibly ) most responsible for the emergence of the universality .    in the present study ,",
    "we allow for a wide range of polytropic equations of state for the thin shell because the properties of the latter are basically unconstrained .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect larger deviations in the universality of the i - love - q relations relative to the neutron star case ( whose equation of state , as a qualitative reference , can be roughly approximated by a polytrope with @xmath229 ) .",
    "in fact , we expect even larger deviations from universality for polytropic indices @xmath230 .",
    "if the equation of state for the thin shell is moderately restricted , therefore , it is possible that the i - love - q relations for thin - shell gravastars will become moderately universal , the degree of the universality would depend on the class of equations of state considered .",
    "since the tidal love numbers of static  @xcite ( and , presumably , also rotating  @xcite ) black holes are identically zero , any measurement of a nonzero tidal love number of a compact object implies that the latter is not a black hole .",
    "this fact is particularly important for gravitational - wave tests of black - hole mimickers and of exotic compact objects . in the near future , gravitational - wave detections of compact - binary inspirals",
    "@xcite will be routine ; such observations may be used to put upper bounds on the tidal love number of the two bodies , thus constraining exotic alternatives .",
    "the first post - newtonian corrections to the inspiral phase of two compact bodies depend only on their masses and spins , but not on their internal structure .",
    "for example , the chirp mass @xmath231 of the event gw150914 places a lower bound on the total mass of the system , @xmath232 . on the other hand",
    ", the merger frequency indicates that the two bodies have to be very compact  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the objects that produced the gravitational - wave events detected so far are ( at least ) as compact as a neutron star but much more massive .",
    "this suggests a pair of merging black holes as the most natural source of the gravitational - wave signal  @xcite .",
    "tidal deformations enter the gravitational waveform formally at fifth post - newtonian order , although they are enhanced by terms proportional to @xmath233  @xcite . in the stationary phase approximation ,",
    "the tidal contribution to the gravitational - wave phase reads  @xcite @xmath234\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is the orbital velocity , @xmath44 and @xmath236 are the total and reduced mass of the binary , respectively .",
    "clearly , this term is zero if the two objects are black holes , because @xmath237 .",
    "thus , an interesting question is to what extend a putative upper limit on @xmath4 can constrain gravastar models .",
    "the merger frequency and individual masses of gw150914 suggest a lower limit on the compactness of the two bodies , @xmath238 . because @xmath4 vanishes in the black - hole limit ,",
    "an upper bound on @xmath4 can be converted into a lower bound on @xmath13 . from our results in figs .",
    "[ n1 ] and [ n3 ] , we observe that @xmath239 when @xmath238 , the exact value depending on the equation of state of the thin shell , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants that depends on the equation of state . ] .",
    "therefore , an upper bound at the level of @xmath240 would provide a lower bound on @xmath241 which is more stringent than the approximate one set by the merger frequency .",
    "a detailed analysis of the possible gravitational - wave constraints on @xmath4 goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "furthermore , because upper limits on the tidal deformability of the binary systems of gw150914 and gw151226 have not been published yet , it is difficult to estimate the constraints on @xmath242 for these systems .",
    "however , similar analyses for neutron - star binary systems have been performed before the recent gravitational - wave detection ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by assuming similar absolute errors",
    ", one might expect an observational bounds at the level of @xmath243 which , for an object of @xmath244 , corresponds to @xmath245 .",
    "this would provide a very stringent lower bound on the compactness and can potentially rule out several equations of state for which a very compact thin - shell gravastar is radially unstable .",
    "in fact , as clear from the results previously presented , all models of gravastars considered in this paper would be radially unstable when @xmath245 .",
    "we have studied the rotational and tidal quadrupole deformations of a thin - shell gravastar , which are characterized by the tidal love number and the rotational quadrupole moment , respectively .",

    "the love number and quadrupole moment are negative for less compact models and the i - love - q relations continuously approach the black - hole limit .",
    "the appearance of negative values of the love number and quadrupole moment means that the elongation direction of the matter distribution on the meridional cross section is turned by @xmath211  degrees relative to the case of an ordinary compact star .",
    "the reason for the appearance of this counterintuitive deformation is not entirely clear , but seems to be related to the strongly anisotropic stress of the thin shell in the horizontal and vertical directions , and to the peculiar equation of state of the gravastar s interior .",
    "similar counterintuitive properties have been found also for others infinitesimally - thin shells deformed by rotational or tidal effects  @xcite .",
    "we considered a wide range of polytropic equations of state for the thin - shell matter . within this range ,",
    "there is no universality in the i - love - q relations , unlike the case of neutron stars and quark stars for which such relations depend only mildly on the stellar equation of state , at the level of a few percent .",
    "although ( some degree of ) approximate universality might be restored by restricting to a subclass of equations of state , it is nevertheless interesting that thin - shell gravastars provide an example of very compact objects for which the universality of the i - love - q relations is manifestly broken .",
    "we also evaluated the stability of the unperturbed spherical gravastars with a polytropic perfect - fluid thin shell against small radial perturbations .",
    "it is found that less compact models are stable and that the stability changes at the maximum mass models of equilibrium sequences characterized by a single equation of state .",
    "the stability analysis implies that the gravastars become unstable as they approach the black - hole limit .",
    "therefore , we inevitably had to use unstable models to investigate the i - love - q relations very close to the black - hole limit .",
    "the instability region shrinks to zero as @xmath135 increases for a fixed value of @xmath136 .",
    "the @xmath246 limit corresponds to the case of a thin shell with vanishing energy density studied in ref .",
    "despite some differences in our analysis ( we corrected the definition of the moment of inertia used in ref .",
    "@xcite and kept the properties of the thin - shell matter fixed along different sequences of solutions ) our results are qualitatively similar to those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and extend the latter to more realistic configurations .    in this study",
    ", we focus on the case of a perfect - fluid thin shell .",
    "however , a thin shell with anisotropic pressure might be more reasonable . for example ,",
    "if the phase transition replacing the would - be horizon  @xcite is due to a scalar field , the latter would naturally give rise to anisotropic stresses .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to investigate in detail the case of gravastars with an anisotropic thin shell .",
    "likewise , it would be interesting to extend our computation to the case of finite - thickness shells , although that would likely require a numerical integration of the field equations within the shell .    a detailed analysis of the observational constraints on the tidal deformability of gravastars coming from gravitational - wave measurements goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nonetheless , our results suggest that near - future constraints on the tidal love numbers of compact objects from inspiral gravitational waveforms can place very stringent lower limits on the compactness of the two objects , ruling out several gravastar models and giving further support to the fact that events like gw150914 and gw151226 are coalescences of a pair of black holes .",
    "so far , studies of rotating models of gravastars are restricted to the case of slow rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is likely that a substantial fraction of black holes are rapidly spinning , and this is surely the case for black holes formed in the coalescences recently detected in the gravitational - wave band by the ligo interferometer  @xcite .",
    "highly - spinning gravastars might be unstable against the ergoregion instability  @xcite , and a detailed studied is therefore necessary to assess their viability as exotic compact objects and black - hole mimickers .",
    "these investigations remain as future work .",

    "<S> the i - love - q relations of a thin - shell gravastar are drastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star . </S>",
