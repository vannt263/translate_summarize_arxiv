    "<S> we use a transfer - matrix method to study the localization properties of vibrations in a ` mass and spring ' model with simple cubic lattice structure . </S>",
    "<S> disorder is applied as a box - distribution to the force - constants @xmath0 of the springs . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the reduced localization lengths @xmath1 from calculated lyapunov exponents for different system widths to roughly locate the squared critical transition frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the data is finite - size scaled to acquire the squared critical transition frequency of @xmath3 and a critical exponent of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the disorder - induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) and the concept of anderson localization @xcite for electrons has been studied extensively for many years . during this time </S>",
    "<S> highly accurate results for the critical disorder and critical exponent have been obtained through numerous numerical methods , such as multifractal analysis @xcite , energy level statistics @xcite and the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) @xcite . although phonon localization has been a topic of research for a similar duration , where the first study of a disordered phonon is credited to lifshitz et al .  in 1954 @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> comparatively , less research has been conducted in the field . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the dynamical matrix through participation ratios @xcite , level - spacing statistics @xcite and multifractal analysis @xcite requires highly accurate numerical results on large system sizes which is not trivial and remains challenging even with todays computing resources .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many features of interest in phononic research , such as the origins of the boson peak @xcite , the name given to the peak in the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) @xmath5 that is an excess contribution compared to the usual debye behaviour @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the modes within the peak are of importance as they are strongly related to the mechanisms of thermal transport in the @xmath7 temperature range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> schirmacher et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite successfully demonstrated that the boson peak consists of extended phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> the locations of the boson peak , ioffe - regel transition between weak and strong elastic - scattering regimes and the localization - delocalization transition ( ldt ) are also of great interest in particular how these are related with each other . </S>",
    "<S> scorpigno et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite state that the link between the locations of the boson - peak and ioffe - regel transition is still debatable , whereas through level statistics kantelhardt et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite estimate the critical phonon frequency to be @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> taraskin et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite declare that the links between vibrational localization , the boson peak , the ioffe - regel crossover and the zero - energy spectral singularity are yet to be fully established .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a )        ( b )        ( c )        here , we take a simple cubic lattice structure made up of point masses connected by springs . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the masses are displaced by only small amplitudes and apply the harmonic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to the classical model of vibration , where the displacements of the masses from their equilibrium positions are governed by the displacements of their nearest neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> due to the symmetry of the lattice we can de - couple the spatial dimensions of the system into three identical problems and massively reduce the time of calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by assuming that all springs have identical central and non - central force constants reducing the @xmath9 force constant matrices to scalars . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , solving for just one spatial dimension achieves all three components of the vibrational amplitude for all lattice sites .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply the above approximations and hence have to solve the standard equation of motion for a single lattice site with a plane wave solution to obtain @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the frequency of vibration , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass and amplitude of vibration of the lattice site denoted by indices @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the force constant of the spring connecting two adjacent lattice sites , where the indices of the current lattice site @xmath14 are omitted to simplify notation . </S>",
    "<S> the system of equations for all lattice sites is converted to matrix form by substitution into the generalised equation of motion    @xmath15^{-1}[k]u}\\ ] ]    the above matrices @xmath16}$ ] and @xmath17}$ ] contain all the masses and force constants of the eigensystem and @xmath18 is a vector of all vibrational amplitudes of the lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16^{-1}[k]}$ ] is the dynamical matrix and is diagonalized to obtain the normal modes of vibration @xmath18 with eigenvalues @xmath19 . although the vibrational amplitudes @xmath18 are for only a single spatial dimension , they are also valid as the total magnitude of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> recombining the individual amplitudes to obtain the total requires multiplication of single components by @xmath20 , renormalization of the eigenvector removes these factors .    </S>",
    "<S> several methods can be used to analyse both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues obtained from diagonalization of the dynamical matrix to distinguish between extended and localized states . </S>",
    "<S> just looking at the amplitude eigenvectors is a viable method of studying the localization lengths of the phonons , although it is not trivial due to the localization lengths diverging as the critical frequency is approached from the localized regime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in finite sized systems the localized states can appear extended as the localization length can be greater than the length of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we diagonalize the dynamical matrix for a box of size @xmath21 with the inclusion of box distribution disorder with width @xmath22 and mean @xmath23 applied to the force constants of the springs . in figure [ fig - states](a)-(c ) </S>",
    "<S> we visualise three amplitude eigenvectors for squared frequencies of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig - states](a ) is that of an extended state as the amplitudes exhibit short range periodicity within the box and figure [ fig - states](c ) is that of a localized state where the amplitudes of vibration are confined to a small section of the box . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig - states](b ) exhibits properties of both extended and localized states and is close to the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the reduced vdos @xmath27 for cubes with size @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with 1360 , 170 and 50 random seeds respectively , resulting in roughly 170,000 states for each system size . </S>",
    "<S> the vdos plot in figure [ fig - k1.0vdos ] demonstrates the latter stages of the broadening of the van hove singularities due to disorder and the emergence of the characteristic low - frequency boson peak at @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the states plotted in figure [ fig - states ] are located close to the upper band edge of the vdos , therefore we can safely assume that the ldt will be in this region .     and width @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> 150 bins are used and the data is normalized by total number of states.[fig - k1.0vdos],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we introduce the tmm which calculates the localization length @xmath35 of a quasi - one dimensional bar . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> the bar geometry has an identical height and width @xmath36 and in all cases the length of the bar @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is not preset as the transfer matrix calculations continue along the length of @xmath38 until the desired accuracy of the lyapunov exponent is met , this convergence criterion is chosen before starting the calculation .    to calculate the lyapunov exponents , the system of equations ( [ equ - dyna ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is converted to a form suitable for the tmm . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the equations to be re - arranged so that the amplitudes of a particular layer of lattice sites can be calculated solely from the amplitudes of the previous layer and the force constants of the surrounding springs . </S>",
    "<S> computationally this is far less memory consuming than storing the whole system of masses and springs , as the tmm calculation only requires parameters for 2 layers of the system to be stored in memory at any one time . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ equ - dyna ] ) for a single lattice site is rearranged into a form where the amplitude of vibration of the nearest neighbour in layer @xmath39 is calculated solely from parameters of sites in layers @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    </S>",

    "<S> the reduced ( dimensionless ) localization length may then be calculated as @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically calculate the reduced localization lengths for a range of squared frequencies and even system widths @xmath36 between 12 and 20 to a convergence criterion of @xmath65 percent of the variance . </S>",

    "<S> the reduced localization lengths from the tmm are finite size scaled by applying the procedure outlined in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finite size scaling ( fss ) procedure obtains the correlation length @xmath66 for an infinite system from the reduced localization length @xmath67 of finite sized systems by using the one - parameter scaling law @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the ldt is characterised by a divergent correlation length , so that at a fixed disorder @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the critical exponent and @xmath2 is the critical frequency squared . </S>",
    "<S> highly accurate numerical studies of the anderson model for electron localization have found the critical exponent @xmath72 @xcite for box distribution disorder . whereas in the phononic case monthus and garel </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have demonstrated that their participation ratio data for high disorder at an ldt collapsed fairly well onto their scaling function using a critical exponent @xmath73 taken from reference @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> although akita and ohtsuki @xcite have previously obtained a much lower value @xmath74 , thought to be a consequence of the transition occurring close to the upper band edge @xcite , we have achieved a striking resemblance between critical exponents between the mit and ldt . </S>",
