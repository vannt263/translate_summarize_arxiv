    "in our progress to understand how galaxies have formed and evolved , it has become recently clear ( e.g. @xcite ) that the present stellar mass of galaxies determines most of the galaxy properties .",
    "it is thus possible to predict _ on average _ what the star formation , metallicity , environment , etc .",
    "a galaxy has by simply measuring its current stellar mass .",
    "however , second order differences among the properties of galaxies with the same stellar mass exist and need to be explained .",
    "one of the most obvious physical mechanisms to explain this second parameter is the spin of the dark matter halo .",
    "it is now 60 years since hoyle s seminal paper on the subject @xcite that showed how angular momentum in galaxies can be generated via the tidal field of the other galaxies .",
    "later on , @xcite developed the tidal torque theory within the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation that determines the amplitude and direction of the spin of a dark matter halo based on the surrounding dark matter field ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "numerical n - body simulations produce results that are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions , although linear theory is not always sufficient to determine the final angular momentum of a collapsed object ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition mergers are expected to significantly alter a halo final spin @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the dark matter halo spin will influence the radius where baryons will settle into a disk @xcite , thus influencing its density and therefore the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "the influence of spin on star formation history has been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of tidal - torque theory in hierarchical models @xcite is the prediction of correlated spin directions and that the spin direction for dark halos is strongly influenced by the halo environment .",
    "@xcite reported a detection of galaxy spin correlations at 97% confidence and @xcite have measured the correlation function of the spin chirality and report , for the first time , of a signal at scales @xmath3 mpc/@xmath4 at the @xmath5 level .",
    "this subject has received renewed interest not just for being a test of tidal torque theory but because the mechanism that produces angular momentum alignment is believed to create correlations between observed galaxy shapes , introducing a potential contamination to the cosmological weak lensing signal .",
    "observationally , the full information on the spin vector of a dark matter halo is very difficult to obtain .",
    "concentrating on disk galaxies , the plane of the disk determines the axis of rotation of the disk of baryonic matter . for galaxies seen in projection ,",
    "the observed galaxy ellipticity constrains the galaxy spin axis . for infinitely thin and perfectly circular disks ,",
    "the spin vector axis would be known but not the spin `` chirality '' ( the spin direction along the axis ) . for realistic disks ,",
    "projection effects mean that what can be measured reliably is the projected spin axis .",
    "information abut the spin chirality is absent in the study of galaxies ellipticity .",
    "nevertheless , the chiral information is known for the sample of face - on galaxies of the galaxy zoo project .",
    "correlation of chirality therefore implies a correlation of the spin vectors .",
    "an expectation of tidal torque theory is that haloes which formed together , and thus experienced a similar tidal field during their initial collapse , will have similarly aligned spin vectors .",
    "galaxy chirality should thus be coherent on scales related to those of large scale structure .    here",
    "we explore whether spatially coherent spin chirality ( and therefore spin vectors ) correlate with other galaxy properties that depend on the galaxy stellar population and star formation history .",
    "our main finding is that the _ absolute _ value of the average spin direction of the galaxies located in a spatial patch ( pixel ) , is correlated with past star formation activity in these galaxies , while we find no correlation with other galaxy properties like metallicity , or with the average spin itself , i.e. the universe does not have a preferred direction .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the galaxy sample selection and the methodology ,  3 presents the results . in ",
    "4 we present some discussion and draw our conclusions .",
    "in the galaxy zoo project , a sample of 893,212 galaxies were visually classified by about 90,000 users .",
    "the sample was selected to be sources that were targeted for sdss spectroscopy , that is extended sources with petrosian magnitude @xmath6 . additionally , we included objects that were not originally targeted as such , but were observed to be galaxies once their spectrum was taken .",
    "where spectroscopic redshifts were available , we found that galaxies have the mean redshift of @xmath7 and the objects with the highest redshift reach @xmath8 .",
    "the galaxies thus probe our local universe at cosmological scales .",
    "each object has been classified about @xmath9 times from a simplified scheme of 6 possible classifications : an elliptical , a clockwise spiral galaxy , an anti - clockwise spiral galaxy , an edge - on spiral galaxy , a star / unknown object , a merger .",
    "various cuts ( hacking attempts , browser misconfigurations , etc . ) removed about 5% of our data .",
    "the data were reduced into two final catalogues based on whether data was weighted or unweighted . in the unweighted data ,",
    "each user s classification carried an equal weight , while in the weighted case , users weights were iteratively adjusted according to how well each user agreed with the classifications of other users . in both cases",
    ", the accrued classifications were further distilled into  super - clean \" ,  clean \" and  cleanish \" catalogs of objects , for which we required 95% , 80% and 60% of users to agree on a given classification . in all cases , this is a statistically significant classification with respect to random voting ; however , the human `` systematical '' error associated with it is difficult to judge . in any case , we are in the limit where taking more data will not change our sample beyond noise fluctuations as the votes are uncorrelated .",
    "a detailed account of the reduction procedures as well as the procedure to measure spin orientations , and removal of systematics is explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider the sample of spiral galaxies of the galaxy zoo project for which the spin chirality ( i.e. the direction of the galaxy arms winding ) has been determined .",
    "this piece of information for each galaxy is what we refer to as halo spin chirality . in general",
    ", the gas of a galaxy should be rotating in the same direction as the halo : about 4% of the galaxies do not obey this @xcite , but there should be a strong although not perfect  correlation between the angular momentum vector of gas and that of the dark matter halo hosting a galaxy @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the chirality of the galaxy is a proxy for the rotation direction of the host dark matter halo .",
    "our catalog of galaxy star formation properties is obtained from @xcite .",
    "this catalog has been constructed from the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the sdsss - dr4 data release @xcite .",
    "star formation histories , metallicities , stellar masses and dust content , have been extracted using the moped @xcite algorithm , which allows for rapid extraction and parameter exploration of galaxy spectra using stellar population models .",
    "the method has been explored in detail in @xcite and has been tested with the vespa @xcite algorithm for accuracy and extent of degeneracies in the recovered parameters ( see @xcite for details ) . the star formation histories catalog from vespa@xcite is available online .",
    "while for the sdss spectra , individual star formation histories are poorly constraint @xcite because of the low @xmath10 , average properties sample are robust and well constrained ; it is these average quantities that we use in our study . @xcite",
    "give a thorough and detailed explanation of the method , its shortcomings and advantages and we refer the interested reader to this paper for a detailed description of the star formation catalog used in the present work .",
    "the catalog contains about half million galaxies .",
    "graphical depiction for a given pixel size of what it means to have high value of @xmath11 . ]    to create our final sample we match the above two catalogs , moped and galaxy zoo ( keeping only galaxies that are classified as clean ) , to obtain a total of @xmath12 galaxies at redshift @xmath13 .",
    "the redshift distribution of our sample is fairly narrow ( the redshift interval @xmath14 encloses 90% of the galaxies , the maximum of the redshift distribution is @xmath15 .",
    "it is this sample that we use in our study .",
    "note that the galaxies in the sample are spirals , and therefore the downsizing effect is not as extreme as in ellipticals .",
    "we uniformly pixelize the survey using a range of pixel sizes . in what follows we use a flat concordance lcdm model to convert between redshifts and distances",
    ". in each pixel",
    "we define a pixel spin chirality @xmath16 given by the average spin chirality for the galaxies in the pixel : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the number of galaxies in pixel @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes a galaxy spin chirality ; @xmath20 can only take values of @xmath21 or @xmath22 while @xmath23 . for uncorrelated spin direction , within the errors @xmath24",
    ", only for correlated spin direction the average spin chirality will be significantly non - zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spincoherence ] ) . note that when we compute the cross - correlation of galaxies quantities with the pixel spin chirality @xmath16 we will use the absolute value , @xmath25 .",
    "we will show that there is no correlation when we use the full value of @xmath16 ( including its sign ) .",
    "each galaxy in the sample ( index @xmath26 ) has associated a stellar mass , a metallicity , a metallicity history and a star formation history .",
    "the star formation history is described by the star formation in independent bins ( index @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 : 9 equally spaced in look back time and two bins for high redshift star formation ( see table 1 ) . for each galaxy ,",
    "the star formation is normalized to unity . for each pixel",
    "we also define a deviation from the mean star formation history given by the average star formation in each bin over the pixel galaxies minus the global average star formation : @xmath29 .",
    "metalicity history is treated in the same way .",
    "note that by comparing average quantities in each pixel rather than total quantities we are not directly sensitive to the galaxy local density .",
    "correlation between chirality and density has been explored in @xcite .",
    "we therefore have several pixelized maps : a map of spin chirality , and 24 maps of galaxy star formation properties ( stellar mass , metallicity , 11 maps of star formation at different look back times , and similarly 11 maps for metalicity history ) .",
    "to quantify a possible correlation between galaxy properties and spin coherence we use the pearson correlation coefficient and explore how it varies as a function of pixel size , lag , and star formation properties .",
    "errors are estimated by repeating the procedure with randomized spins .",
    "this cross - correlation in pixels of a finite size essentially contains information on integrated cross - correlation function below some pixel size .",
    "if certain properties correlate in two - point statistics up to a certain scale , our statistical test will pick it up .",
    ".centre and boundaries ( ( l)ower , ( c)enter , ( u)pper ) of the star formation bins in redshift ( @xmath30 ) and look - back time @xmath31 in gyr [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : spin ]    table  2 shows for the 11 look - back times , the percentage deviation from zero in the value of the pixel spin chirality when we consider the sign and demonstrates that a small bias at the @xmath32% level remains , toward negative values of @xmath33 but below the intrinsic error . to calculate the values of the bias in each look - back time bin",
    "we calculate @xmath34 for all the galaxies in that bin that contribute to more than 90% of the bin star formation .",
    "we have also verified that the strength of the correlation signal does not depend on how many galaxies are included in the sample by randomly sub - sampling the catalog , the error - bars of course increase when less galaxies are considered .",
    "because star formation is also correlated with mass @xcite , we explore if the above correlation is driven by the mass of the galaxy .",
    "moped provides the present and total stellar mass in the galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrmass ] we show the above correlation but for three mass ranges .",
    "the dashed line shows the correlation level for a map where the absolute values of pixel spins chirality have been redistributed randomly and therefore is a measure of the noise level .",
    "we note that the correlation at early times ( bins 1 - 2 ) is dominated by galaxies in the mass range @xmath35 m@xmath36 .",
    "( recall that since the sample is approximately volume limited the number of galaxies in each for the mass bins decreases rapidly with increasing mass , so the trend is not driven by the number of galaxies in each mass bin ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the strong correlation found between mass and star formation in the past by @xcite .",
    "we conclude then that the observed correlation between spin chirality and early star formation is not driven by mass but by star formation activity .",
    "so far we have used the galaxies from galaxy zoo classified as clean which limits our sample to only @xmath12 galaxies . because there are many more galaxies in the moped catalog we have implemented the following algorithm to increase the galaxy zoo sample .",
    "we weight the chirality of a galaxy by the number of votes from the public .",
    "if most people voted for one direction this algorithm converges to the clean sample we used before .",
    "the results of the correlation so obtained are similar to fig .  1 within the errors bars .",
    "halo spin directions correlate with the large - scale structure see e.g. @xcite : halos in sheets tend to have their angular momentum parallel to the sheet , a weaker indication is observed for halos in filaments to have their spin perpendicular to the filament direction .",
    "spins directions are also correlated , as seen in observations @xcite and as predicted by tidal torque theory @xcite .",
    "we have found significant correlation between past star formation activity and the degree of coherence of spin chirality for galaxies in a spatial patch ( pixel spin chirality ) .",
    "while we have only used the chiral information of nearly face - on galaxies , the detection of a non - zero signal can only be produced if spin orientations are correlated .",
    "the correlation is highest for regions in which galaxies have formed most of their stars in the past .",
    "we do not find significant correlations with spin coherence for any of the other measured galaxy properties that we have considered ( metalicity , stellar mass , metalicity history ) .",
    "we note that using chiral information rather than axis inferred from the projected ellipsoid is safer from the perspective of potential systematic effects .",
    "the reason for this is that inferred properties of stellar population are likely to be affected by the galaxy being viewed face - on or edge - on . these properties , on the other hand ,",
    "can not be affected by the galactic arms winding on way or another .",
    "our analysis indicates that neighboring spiral galaxies which have similar star formation histories also have their spins aligned .",
    "we can interpret this as the large - scale environement influencing dark matter halo spins , giving it a large scale coherence length , and that either halo spin , environment , or a combination of the two , influence galaxy star formation histories .",
    "this can be understood in the context of tidal - torque theory .",
    "galaxies that have their spins aligned are formed in the same filament or sheet and at about the same time .",
    "this correlation is stronger for regions comprising galaxies with older stars , while regions containing significant fractions of galaxies with recent star formation exhibit a smaller correlation with spin coherence .",
    "this can be understood as these galaxies being formed in the field and thus being affected by a random tidal field and at different epochs or having had a recent major merger , which would promote recent star formation but deviate the spin direction from that set by the cosmological tidal field .",
    "our results imply that in simulations of galaxy formation one should expect to detect the early formation of big spiral galaxies in the filaments around clusters .",
    "it is the halos in the filaments that should carry the majority of the star formation of the big spirals .",
    "further , one would expect that most star formation today should be in the field , away from the filaments and that these objects should have randomly oriented spins .",
    "this finding indicate that spin and the correlation between spin and star formation are new , measurable quantities which offer a new complementary way to explore and quantify the effect of environment on star formation @xcite . we are planning to explore these issues using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "another possible implication for these results involve weak gravitational lensing studies .",
    "a weak lensing survey s potential to yield a faithful reconstruction of the cosmological distribution of dark matter is limited by the unknown intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes .",
    "there is evidence that intrinsic galaxy shapes are spatially correlated @xcite , due to the fact that the alignment of galaxy disks orientations is induced by halo spins correlations @xcite .",
    "our results seems to indicate that , if the star formation history could be measured for at least some of the lensed galaxies , the properties of their star formation histories could be used to predict galaxies spin alignment and thus intrinsic shape alignment .",
