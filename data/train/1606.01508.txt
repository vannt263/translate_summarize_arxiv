    "the interaction between blackbody radiation ( bbr ) and atomic system has long attracted physicists interests . with rapid improvements in atomic physics ,",
    "the importance of bbr is more and more obvious , in both fundamental and applied science . in determination of frequency and time",
    ", the roles of uncertainty induced by bbr were stressed in the most accurate clock experiments @xcite . by monitoring the bbr environment ,",
    "the accuracy could also be significantly improved in optical lattice clock @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of uncertainties brought by the bbr - shift is @xmath5 in the optical lattice clocks @xcite .",
    "it was the obstacle in determining the frequency standard at the accuracy of @xmath6 .",
    "this has stimulated a lot of works on calculating bbr - shift in the clock system @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical work , gallagher and cooke first indicated that one should take bbr into account in rydberg atoms even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the first accurate calculation of dynamic stark shifts and depopulation rates of rydberg energy levels induced by bbr was given by farley @xcite , whose work is one of the most important founding efforts on theoretical scheme allowing people to calculate bbr effects in an atomic system .",
    "the early works mainly focused on the rydberg atoms since the atoms in such states have very large radii so that it strengthens the interaction between atoms and bbr .",
    "however , as the advance of high - precision spectroscopy and frequency metrology of atomic physics , the bbr effect on low - lying energy level transition is also increasingly showing its unique charm @xcite .",
    "this will definitely lead a progress for understanding fundamental physical constants , such as rydberg constant @xmath7 and fine - structure constant @xmath8 .",
    "even more delighting , the boltzmann constant , which is irrelevant with frequency transition , could be determined by a measured molar polarizability and calculation to the thermal effect brought by bbr @xcite . in the last decades",
    ", tremendous theoretical schemes have been developed and used to help us to reveal and check the various subtle effects in atoms , such as qed - nuclear recoil ( qed : quantum electrodynamics ) , qed - nuclear size , even if the weak interaction @xcite . in the aspects of fundamental interests ,",
    "a first - principle approach is naturally expected to be developed to allow us considering the effect like qed - bbr and so on .",
    "based on the finite - temperature quantum field ( ftqft ) approach @xcite , solovyev and the colleagues made an effort to derive a qed scheme to bbr effect on atoms @xcite . in their work , a unique mixing effect which is from the field quantitation was reported ( an additional correction to the level width ) .",
    "escobedo and soto obtained the leading term of bbr - shift by using the potential nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",

    "in next sections , we would show that this @xmath9 term is related with higher - order one - loop bbr - shift and the leading term of two - loop bbr - shift .    in this work ,",
    "we derive these higher - order corrections of bbr - shift by using the first principle method , which is the combination of the bound - state s - matrix @xcite , finite - temperature quantum field theory @xcite and non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics ( nrqed ) @xcite .",
