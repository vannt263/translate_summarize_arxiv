    "a number of open problems come into attention : the calculation of the mean - square geodesic end - to - end distance ( as measured on the surface and not in the embedding space ) , the statistics of the winding numbers ( mainly for the polymer on the torus case ) , the influence of the topological defects existing on the surface , the presence of excluded volume and other types of potential interactions .",
    "we hope to address some of these issues in the near future .",

    "<S> in this paper we have considered a gaussian polymer chain of length @xmath0 as an intrinsic object enclosed on a surface embedded in the euclidean space . when the surfaces are the sphere @xmath1 in @xmath2 dimensions and the cylinder , the cone and the curved torus in @xmath3 , we have calculated analytically and numerically ( using the diffusion equation and the path - integral approach ) the probability distribution function @xmath4 of the end - to - end vector @xmath5 and the mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath6 of the polymer chain . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are : the curvature of the surfaces induces a geometrical localization area ; at short scales ( @xmath7 ) the polymer is locally flat and the mean - square end - to - end distance is just the gaussian value @xmath8 ( @xmath9 = kuhn length ) , independent of the metric properties of the surface ; at large scales ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 tends to a constant value in the sphere case , it is linear in @xmath0 for the cylinder and reaches different constant values ( as a function of the geometry of the surface ) for the curved torus . in the case of the cone , </S>",
    "<S> contraction of the chain is induced at all length scales by the presence of the vertex , as a function of the opening angle @xmath12 and the end position @xmath13 of the chain . </S>",
