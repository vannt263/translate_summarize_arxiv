    "the objective of this review is to present the experimental phenomenology for polymer self - diffusion and for diffusion of tracer polymers through polymer solutions .",
    "we proceed by examining how the diffusion coefficient depends on polymer concentration @xmath1 , polymer molecular weight @xmath7 , solvent quality , and other variables .",
    "we examine how rapidly a probe polymer of molecular weight @xmath8 diffuses through a matrix polymer of molecular weight @xmath7 , perhaps as the concentrations of the matrix and probe polymers are varied . after establishing the phenomenological behavior",
    ", we compare the phenomenology with various classes of theoretical model .",
    "this is not a review of the extremely extensive theoretical literature on polymer diffusion in solution . for such reviews , note works of graessley@xcite , tirrell@xcite , pearson@xcite , skolnick@xcite , lodge@xcite , and ( more recently but less directly ) mcleish@xcite .",
    "recent papers by schweizer and collaborators@xcite include extensive references to the more recent literature .",
    "we will note classes of models , but not their underlying derivations .",
    "we also do not consider melt systems , or polymer mutual diffusion .    in comparing phenomenology with model predictions",
    ", it will remain critical to distinguish between properties that are consistent with a particular model , but do not actually prove it , and properties that require or refute the correctness of a particular model .",
    "for example , skolnick@xcite has shown that the nominal signature of reptation @xmath9 is found in computer models of polymers , in a model system in which the chains are very certainly not reptating .",
    "a finding @xmath9 is thus consistent with many tube - type solution models , but does not prove their correctness . on the other hand ,",
    "most tube - type models require that polymer chains move via constrained diffusion for shorter times . in these models ,",
    "the shorter - time mean - square displacement of a single chain must scale more slowly than linearly with time .",
    "if the shorter - time mean - square displacement were instead linear in elapsed time , many constrained - diffusion models would be rejected by experiment .",

    "section vii summarizes conclusions .",
    "tables of fitting parameters appear as appendices .",
    "this section presents a consistent nomenclature for polymer diffusion coefficients and describes methods whereby which such diffusion coefficients are measured .",
    "a short description is given of the literature on diffusion in multimacrocomponent solutions .",
    "the literature in question provides the fundamental basis for interpreting the experimental measurements .",
    "finally , phenomenological classes of models for polymer dynamics are identified .",
    "this section sets out a consistent nomenclature for the diffusion coefficients that we are reviewing . in a solution containing a solvent and one macromolecular species ,",
    "two physically distinct diffusion coefficients usefully characterize macromolecule diffusion .",
    "one of these , the two - particle or _ mutual _ diffusion coefficient @xmath10 , describes via fick s law @xmath11 the relaxation of a concentration gradient . here",
    "@xmath12 is the diffusion current and @xmath1 is the local instantaneous macromolecule concentration .",
    "the other diffusion coefficient , the single - particle or _ self _ diffusion coefficient @xmath13 , describes the diffusion of a single macromolecule through a uniform solution of elsewise identical macromolecules . in a simple macromolecule solution , quasi - elastic light scattering spectroscopy ( qelss ) measures the mutual diffusion coefficient of the macromolecules@xcite . pulsed - field - gradient nuclear magnetic resonance ( pfgnmr )",
    "measures the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "solutions containing a solvent and two macromolecule species show a more complicated diffusive behavior .",
    "theoretical treatments of this issue are described in the next section . in general , in two - macrocomponent solutions the temporal evolution of transient concentration fluctuations is described by two relaxation times , each describing the relaxation of a coupled mode involving the concentrations of both macromolecule species .",
    "an interesting special case arises if one macrocomponent , the _ probe _ , is adequately dilute , while the other macrocomponent , the _ matrix _ , may be either dilute or concentrated .",
    "in this special case , the diffusion of the probe species is governed by a single - particle diffusion coefficient , namely the _ probe _",
    "diffusion coefficient @xmath14 . in the special case that the matrix species and solvent are isorefractive ,",
    "so that the index of refraction is independent of the relative amounts of matrix polymer and solvent , the matrix species scatters next to no light .",
    "if in this special case light scattering by a dilute probe species dominates scattering by the solution ( which further requires that solvent scattering be sufficiently weak ) , the diffusion coefficient measured by qelss is@xcite the probe diffusion coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "a variety of physical techniques have been used to measure probe diffusion through a polymer solution . in the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) technique ,",
    "a small fluorescent label is attached to the probes .",
    "an intense pulse of light ( the ` pump ' laser beam ) is then used to destroy (  bleach \" ) the fluorescent labels in some regions of the solution , the regions sometimes being defined via a holographic grating . much weaker laser illumination ( the ` probe ' beam ) is then used to monitor the recovery of the fluorescence intensity as unbleached fluorescent molecules diffuse back into the regions(s ) in which the bleaching occurred .",
    "an alternative to frap is forced rayleigh scattering ( frs ) . in an frs experiment ,",
    "an intense laser pulse is used to generate a holographic brightness grating in solution .",
    "the grating selectively alters a photosensitive part of the probe molecule , thereby creating an index of refraction grating in the solution . a much weaker probe beam",
    "is then used to monitor the diffusive relaxation of the induced grating .",
    "significant complications may arise if the photomodified and non - photomodified forms of the probe species differ significantly in their diffusive properties .",
    "if the probe species is dilute , with either frap or frs the time dependence of the recovery profile is determined by the single - particle ( probe- ) diffusion coefficient of the probe molecules@xcite .",
    "a physically - distinct alternative to frap and frs is fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) , in which optical methods are used to measure fluctuations in the number of fluorescent molecules in a small volume of space . in nondilute solution",
    "the diffusion coefficient measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) varies from @xmath14 to @xmath10 as the fraction of macromolecules that bear fluorescent tags is varied from small to large@xcite .    when is a probe species dilute ?",
    "in general , the careful experimenter makes an adequate control study of the effect of varying the probe concentration @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14 is the extrapolation of the measured probe diffusion coefficient to zero probe concentration . in some systems",
    "@xmath14 is substantially independent of @xmath15 , and no extrapolation is needed .",
    "in other systems ( see below ) @xmath14 depends significantly on @xmath15 , and extrapolation to @xmath16 must be performed .",
    "several authors have measured the initial slope @xmath17 of the dependence of @xmath14 on probe concentration , and the effect of matrix concentration on @xmath17 .",
    "it is also possible to study  most published work has used qelss ",
    "the relaxation of concentration fluctuations in a ternary solvent : macromolecule : macromolecule system in which neither macrocomponent is dilute . as reviewed below",
    ", such studies give information on the diagonal and cross - diffusion coefficients of the two species and on their thermodynamic interactions .    strictly speaking ,",
    "if frap or frs is used to study the diffusion of a dilute labelled polymer through a matrix polymer solution , the labelled polymer differing from the matrix in that a fluorescent small - molecule label has been attached , the measured diffusion coefficient should be termed a probe diffusion coefficient , because the molecules being tracked are chemically distinguishable from the molecules not being tracked . however , for the purposes of this review , we distinguish between ( i ) the case in which the probe and matrix polymers are substantially distinct in molecular weight or chemical nature , and ( ii ) the case in which the probe and matrix polymers are very nearly the same except for the presence of the label .",
    "the phrase probe diffusion coefficient is reserved for case ( i ) , while measurements under case ( ii ) are here treated as determinations of the self diffusion coefficient .",
    "the term _ tracer _ diffusion coefficient is synonymous with _ single - particle _ diffusion coefficient , and includes both the self and probe diffusion coefficients as special cases .",
    "the _ interdiffusion _ and _ cooperative diffusion _",
    "coefficients characterize the relaxation times in a ternary system in which neither macrocomponent is dilute . in the following",
    "the latter two terms are almost never used .",
    "what is the basis for using spectroscopic methods such as qelss , frap , frs , or fcs to measure @xmath13 or @xmath14 ? in each case , there is a physical theory that links the correlation function determined spectroscopically to fluctuations in microscopic variables that describe the liquid .",
    "for example , for fcs the fluctuations in the fluorescent light intensity @xmath18 arise from fluctuations in the number of fluorescent molecules in the scattering volume .",
    "the time correlation function @xmath19 of the fluorescent intensity follows faithfully the time correlation function @xmath20 of the ( fluctuating ) number @xmath21 of labelled molecules in the scattering volume , so to determine the time dependence of @xmath22 one only needs to determine @xmath23 and vice versa .    for qelss ,",
    "the spectrum is determined@xcite by the field correlation function @xmath24 of the scattered light , which is in turn determined by the motion of the scattering molecules via @xmath25 \\right\\rangle ,       \\label{eq : g1def}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 label two of the @xmath28 scatterers , @xmath29 is the position of scatterer @xmath26 at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the scattering cross - section of particle @xmath27 , and @xmath32 is the scattering vector . for",
    "the special case in which the scattering particles are dilute ( non - scattering particles do not need to be dilute ) , correlations between the positions of two distinct scatterers at two times vanish .",
    "the correlation function for probe scattering then reduces to @xmath33 \\right\\rangle ,       \\label{eq : g1defp}\\ ] ] in which @xmath34 .",
    "there are three general approaches to calculating @xmath35 .",
    "first , scatterers can be treated as objects having hydrodynamic and direct , e.g. , excluded volume , interactions , and the effect of the intermacromolecular interactions on @xmath36 can be calculated .",
    "second , it can be recognized that @xmath37 $ ] is the @xmath38 spatial fourier component of the scatterer concentration at time @xmath30 , and semicontinuum hydrodynamic methods and the onsager regression hypothesis can be used calculate the average temporal evolution of a fluctuation .",
    "third , it can be proposed that the scatterers perform simple brownian motion , with the probability distribution function for @xmath39 being applied to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "light scattering spectra of non - ideal single - component macromolecule solutions , including direct interactions and hydrodynamic interactions at the oseen level , were initially calculated by altenberger and deutsch@xcite .",
    "calculations of light scattering spectra of non - dilute many - component macromolecule solutions soon followed@xcite . in the latter papers , diffusion coefficients were modeled on the lines of kirkwood , et al.@xcite , the diffusion coefficients being written as products of thermodynamic derivatives @xmath40 obtained from the intermacromolecular forces , and phenomenological transport coefficients @xmath41 ( here @xmath26 and @xmath27 label chemical species ) . if neither macromolecular species was dilute , the light scattering spectrum obtained by qelss is predicted@xcite to contain two relaxation modes . even if only one of the two macromolecule species scattered light , both modes are predicted to be visible , in general , in the light scattering spectrum@xcite .",
    "a subsequent paper@xcite extended these findings to the special case explored e.g. , by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy , in which some macromolecules are tagged so that their movements can be tracked . for the case that the tagged macromolecules are dilute , it was shown@xcite that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and other equivalent techniques measure the self - diffusion coefficient of the tagged probe macromolecules diffusing through the unlabelled matrix macromolecules .",
    "a smoluchowski approach was used by jones@xcite to examine interacting spherical polymers , including the special case that one of the polymer species is dilute and tagged so that its motions could be observed . in the special case ,",
    "the measured diffusion coefficient was predicted by jones to be determined only by the hydrodynamic interactions of the tracer polymers with their ( predominantly matrix - polymer ) neighbors . while jones does not use the same nomenclature , the diffusion coefficient of the tracers calculated in ref .",
    "may be recognized as the single - particle diffusion coefficient .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach culminates in analyses of carter , et al.@xcite and phillies@xcite of mutual and tracer diffusion coefficients , including full hydrodynamic and direct interactions between interacting diffusing particles and reference frame issues .",
    "extensive studies of diffusion of interacting polymers using semicontinuum and related means were made by akcasu , benmouna , cohen and others . in 1987 ,",
    "benmouna , et al.@xcite calculated dynamic scattering from a solution containing two polymer species , including excluded volume terms with a flory interaction parameter but ignoring hydrodynamic interactions between polymer chains .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions were neglected in the sense that cross - species transport coefficients were assumed to vanish .",
    "the assumption that the hydrodynamic parts @xmath41 of the cross - diffusion tensor vanish can not be true simultaneously in the solvent- and volume - fixed reference frames@xcite .",
    "polymer solutions can be very concentrated , so neglect of reference frame issues in entirely correct calculations may lead to complications in the physical interpretation of an assumption that hydrodynamics has been neglected .",
    "benmouna , et al.@xcite examined the special case of two species identical except for their optical scattering cross - sections , showing results consistent with those of phillies@xcite , notably : if the matrix species scatters weakly , an interdiffusion mode describing single - chain motion is dominant at low probe concentrations .",
    "there is a thermodynamic regime relative to the spinodal where the diffusion equations describe phase separation .",
    "the benmouna model was then extended to treat solutions of copolymers@xcite , still with neglect of hydrodynamic interactions , and to treat homopolymer : copolymer mixtures@xcite .    in the same period ,",
    "foley and cohen@xcite analyzed concentration fluctuations in polymer : polymer : solvent mixtures , using an ornate flory - huggins form for the thermodynamic free energy of the mixture , again neglecting interchain hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the case of a solvent isorefractive with the matrix polymer , in the presence of a dilute scattering species , was treated .",
    "foley and cohen also examined systems in which both polymer species were nondilute , predicting that in this case the relaxation spectrum is characterized by three distinct relaxation times .",
    "in contrast , other calculations on similar models predict only two relaxation times .",
    "roby and joanny@xcite improved the model of benmouna , et al.@xcite by incorporating interchain hydrodynamic interactions and by improving the model for direct chain - chain interactions . at elevated concentrations ,",
    "the correctness of the reptation model was assumed .",
    "the effect of reptation dynamics on concentration fluctuations was estimated with the approximation that a solution is effectively a polymer melt in which mesoscopic polymer - solvent blobs play the role taken in polymer melts by monomer units . for simplicity , the model was restricted to systems containing equal amounts of two species having the same molecular weight .",
    "these restrictions are nontrivial to remove but exclude analysis of tagged - tracer experiments .",
    "a model calculation incorporating a similar picture , but without the restrictions , was reported by hammouda@xcite .",
    "an alternative analysis of a ternary solution of two polymers and a solvent was presented by wang@xcite , who followed much of the earlier work on polymer solutions in assuming that the cross terms in the mobility matrix vanish .",
    "wang systematically analysed a variety of general and special cases , showing a range of interesting parameters that can be determined from light scattering spectra if the accuracy of his model is assumed .",
    "in addition to the tracer case ( one polymer : solvent pair isorefractive , visible polymer dilute ) , wang analysed the special case  zero average contrast \" , in which the polymer refractive increments are of opposite sign , so that concentration fluctuations , that change the total polymer concentration without changing the local polymer composition , scatter no light .",
    "wang showed that the qelss spectrum of a zero - average - contrast system is almost always bimodal , though it may happen that one of the modes is much weaker than the other .",
    "treatments of the field correlation function based on a brownian motion description can be traced back to berne and pecora@xcite , who treat the light scattering spectrum of a solution of dilute , _ noninteracting _ brownian particles .",
    "the motion of such particles is described as a series of random , uncorrelated steps , in which case from the central limit theorem the probability distribution for particle displacements is @xmath42 @xmath43^{-3/2 } \\exp\\left [ - 3 ( \\delta r)^2/ 2 \\langle ( \\delta \\mathbf{r})^{2 } \\rangle\\right ] ,       \\label{eq : deltar}\\ ] ] where the mean - square particle displacement is related to the diffusion coefficient by @xmath44    combining eqs [ eq : g1def ] and [ eq : deltar ] , @xmath45\\ ] ] @xmath46^{-3/2 } \\exp [ - 3 ( \\delta r)^2/ 2 \\langle ( \\delta \\mathbf{r})^{2 } \\rangle ] ,       \\label{eq : g1calc}\\ ] ] which using eq [ eq : deltarval ] leads to @xmath47    for brownian particles in low - viscosity small - molecule solvents , the stokes - einstein equation @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath50 is the absolute temperature , @xmath51 is the solution viscosity , and @xmath52 is the particle radius , generally predicts accurately the particle diffusion coefficient . for diffusion in polymer solutions , two _",

    ", one could formally define a microviscosity @xmath54 as @xmath55 and compares @xmath54 with the macroscopically - measured viscosities @xmath51 of the solution and @xmath56 of the solvent .",
    "the microviscosity is more commonly applied to describe diffusion of mesoscopic globular probe particles@xcite , rather than to treat the diffusion of random - coil polymers in solution .",
    "second , light scattering and other relaxation spectra are not always single exponentials . no matter what functional form @xmath35 has , one may formally write @xmath57 as the _ definition _ of @xmath58 . in this equation",

    "the second extension has serious physical difficulties .",
    "in particular , comparing eqs [ eq : deltarval ] , [ eq : g1calc2 ] , and [ eq : g1calcdt ] , and noting from reflection symmetry that terms odd in @xmath64 vanish , one finds that the extension assumes that @xmath65 \\right\\rangle = \\exp[- q^{2 } \\left\\langle   ( \\delta \\mathbf{r})^{2 } \\right\\rangle ] .",

    "that is , this analysis refers to systems in which particle motion is observed only over times _ much longer _ than any viscoelastic relaxation times .",
    "if particle motion were observed over times shorter than the viscoelastic relaxation times , which in a concentrated polymer solution might be 1 second or more : particle displacements in successive moments would be correlated .",

    "the path from eq [ eq : g1def ] to eq [ eq : etaomega ] might be an interesting heuristic , but would not be consistent with the properties of particles executing brownian motion .",
    "of course , with respect to polymer dynamics the interest in eqs [ eq : g1calcdt][eq : rsquaregaussian ] has been exactly the study of particle motions at short times , during which viscoelastic effects are apparent in @xmath58 , but these are precisely the circumstances under which eq [ eq : rsquaregaussian ] is incorrect .",
