    "this may be resolved by deep surveys on faint x - ray sources in hard x - ray bands , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the detailed adaf spectral calculations by @xcite showed that many sources at redshift @xmath13 with adafs accreting at the rates close to the critical value would be required to reproduce the observed spectral shape of the xrb with an energy peak at @xmath2  kev .",
    "however , @xcite s spectral calculations for riafs accreting at the critical value showed higher energy peaks at several hundred kev , which are unable to reproduce the observed spectral shape of the xrb ( see fig . 2 in cao , 2005 ) .",
    "the reason is that @xcite adopted a larger @xmath95 than that used by @xcite for traditional adafs , which leads to higher electron temperatures of the accretion flows ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "@xcite s calculations are limited to the spectral shape , which have not included the contribution of the adafs in all galaxies to the xrb quantitatively , and the contribution of normal bright agns has not been considered either .",
    "our present calculations show that the spectra of the riafs surrounding kerr black holes have peaks at around 10 - 100 kev , which depend sensitively on accretion rates ( see fig .",
    "we find that our model calculations can fit both the intensity and the spectral shape of the xrb very well , if the riafs surrounding the kerr black holes with @xmath3 in inactive galaxies are accreting at @xmath147 .",
    "@xcite calculated the contribution to the xrb from the riafs accreting at the critical rate , and found that the timescale for the sources accreting at the critical rate should be much shorter than the bright agn lifetime . in that work , it was found that the spectral shape of the xrb can not be reproduced even the riafs contribution is included .",
    "our present calculations imply the contribution from the riafs in the inactive galaxies accreting at @xmath148 should dominate over that from those accreting at the critical value .",
    "it means that the timescale of agns accreting at around the critical value should be even shorter than that given by @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we have to assume the black holes in all inactive galaxies are accreting at an average rate @xmath60 , because we are almost ignorant of how the accretion rate evolves with time in active / inactive galaxies .",
    "a more realistic possibility may be that the massive black holes in inactive galaxies are accreting at different rates from far below @xmath149 up to the critical value of @xmath150 , of which the stacked spectra ( combined with the contribution from the type i / ii agns ) may reproduce the observed xrb .",
    "the spectrum of the riaf accreting at the critical value is peaked at @xmath151  kev , due to the saturated comptonization ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "these riafs are x - ray luminous , and therefore much more inactive galaxies accreting at very low rates ( @xmath152 ) are required to reproduce the intensity of the xrb .",
    "however , the spectral shape of the xrb with an energy peak @xmath2  kev can not be fitted in this way , because the energy peaks of the riaf spectra are around several hundred kev while they are accreting at @xmath153 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it means the contribution of the riafs accreting at around the critical value to the xrb should be unimportant compared with other inactive galaxies , which , again , suggests that the accretion rates of the riafs in inactive galaxies should decreases very rapidly after the accretion mode transition .",
    "it provides evidence of the feedback on the circumnuclear gases from the nuclear radiation , which is qualitatively consistent with the numerical simulations ( see fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the riaf may have winds , and a power - law radius - dependent accretion rate , @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) , is assumed , though the detailed physics is still unclear @xcite .",
    "as most x - ray emission is from the inner region of the accretion flow near the black hole , the x - ray spectrum of a riaf is similar to a riaf with winds , provided they have the same accretion rate at their inner edge . in this work",
    ", we are investigating the growth of black holes , so we focus on the accretion rate at the inner edge of the accretion flow .",
    "thus , the conclusions will not be altered , even if winds are present in the riafs .",
