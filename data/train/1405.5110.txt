    "the connection between zeros of @xmath0-functions and eigenvalues of random matrices first appeared in montgomery s seminal paper on the pair correlation of zeros of the riemann zeta function @xcite , where he proved that for suitably restricted test functions the pair correlation of the zeros of @xmath4 equals the pair correlation of the eigenvalues of random matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "this work was later complemented by extensive numerical calculations of the zeros of @xmath4 by odlyzko @xcite that gave outstanding evidence for the agreement between local statistics of these zeros and the corresponding gue statistics .",
    "it has also been shown that the @xmath5-level correlations of the zeros of @xmath4 agree with the corresponding gue statistics , again for suitably restricted test functions @xcite .    in the work of rudnick and sarnak @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the @xmath5-level correlations of zeros of primitive automorphic @xmath0-functions all agree with the gue statistics .",
    "however , it was predicted by katz and sarnak @xcite that by looking at low - lying zeros of families of @xmath0-functions , one should expect different statistics , which correspond to statistics of eigenvalues coming from scaling limits of certain compact lie groups , specifically one of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our purpose in the present paper is to study the low - lying zeros of the @xmath0-functions attached to the family of quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve @xmath1 over @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is given in global minimal weierstrass form as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",

    "we denote the conductor of @xmath1 by @xmath11 and recall that for @xmath12 we have @xmath13 if and only if @xmath14 .",
    "in general the conductor of an elliptic curve is a rather subtle object .",
    "however , for our purposes it will be enough to note that for all elliptic curves over @xmath2 the conductor is at least @xmath15 ; in particular we have @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we now recall the definition of the @xmath0-function of @xmath1 .",
    "the trace of the frobenius endomorphism is given , for @xmath17 , by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of projective points on the reduction of @xmath1 modulo @xmath20 .",

    "we are interested in the quadratic twists @xmath41 of the fixed elliptic curve @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that we can , by a change of variables , assume that @xmath42 is square - free .",

    "we stress that , as long as we keep @xmath42 square - free , @xmath53 is a real primitive character ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "this observation will always allow us to reduce the study of quadratic twists by general @xmath42 to quadratic twists by square - free @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath0-functions coming from elliptic curves are in many ways analogous to the riemann zeta function . in particular",
    "they are expected to satisfy the following riemann hypothesis .",

    "to allow a maximally detailed analysis of the the @xmath3-level density , we first consider the family @xmath75 which clearly contains an abundance of repetitions .",
    "hence we introduce the following weighted @xmath3-level density @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an even nonnegative schwartz test function having positive total mass ( which morally restricts the sum to @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 note that any given zero occurring in will be repeated infinitely many times .",
    "however , since @xmath60 and @xmath80 are rapidly decaying , most zeros will not be given a large total weight in the outer sum .",
    "indeed , a zero that is given a large total weight necessarily originates from a curve with small conductor , but such zeros are on average quite far from the real line and thus can not give a large contribution to the @xmath3-level density .",

    "it turns out that for test functions @xmath60 whose fourier transform has restricted support , young @xcite has shown that , in certain families of elliptic curves , lower order terms of order @xmath88 do exist in the @xmath3-level density .",
    "moreover , these terms can not be explained using random matrix theory .",
    "such lower order terms have also been found in families of quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic curve @xcite",
    ". the limitations of random matrix theory for making predictions on statistics of @xmath0-functions have also been observed in other contexts , most notably in predictions for moments @xcite .",
    "an extremely powerful conjecture was put forward by conrey , farmer and zirnbauer @xcite , which predicts estimates for averages of quotients of ( products of ) @xmath0-functions evaluated at certain values .",
    "a variant of this conjecture implies a formula for @xmath81 which contains the katz - sarnak prediction , lower order terms and an error term of size at most @xmath89 ( see @xcite ) .",
