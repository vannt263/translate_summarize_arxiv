    "precision measurements at the lep have been extremely successful in confirming the validity of the standard model(sm)@xcite . indeed , in order to have agreements between theory and experiments , one has to go beyond the tree - level calculations and include known electroweak(ew ) radiative corrections .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , there is a concensus that the sm can only be a low energy limit of a more complete theory .",
    "it is thus of the utmost importance to try and push to the limit in finding possible deviations from the sm .",
    "in fact , there are systematic programs for such precision tests",
    ". possible deviations from the sm can all be summarized into a few parameters which then serve to measure the effects of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "a lot of efforts have gone into this type of investigation trying to develop a scheme to minimize the disadvantage of having unkown top quark mass@xmath7 but to optimize sensitivity to new physics . to date",
    "significant constraint !",
    "s have been placed on a number of the technicolor model@xcite , and some extended gauge models@xcite . in this work",
    "we wish to apply the analysis to another extension of the sm , the @xmath8 family model . amongst several of the available parametrization schemes in the literature ,",
    "the most appropriate one for our purposes is that of altarelli et .",
    "this is because their @xmath9-parametrization can be used for new physics which might appear at energy scales not far from those of the sm .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath8 model .",
    "we still find that parameters in this model are severely constrained .",
    "thus , the precision ew tests have demonstrated clearly that they are powerful tools in shaping our searches for extensions of the sm .    in sec .",
    "ii , we will describe the @xmath8 model , spelling out in detail the parts that are relevant to precision tests . in sec .",
    "iii , we summarize properties of the @xmath9-parameters which will be used in our analysis . sec .",
    "iv contains our detailed numerical results . finally , some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the @xmath10 model , proposed some time ago@xcite , is the simplest extension of the standard model of three generations that unifies the standard @xmath11 with the horizontal gauge group @xmath12 into an anomaly free , simple , lie group . in this model ,",
    "the six left - handed quarks ( or leptons ) belong to a * 6 * of @xmath13 , while the right - handed fermions are all singlets .",
    "it is thus a straightforward generalization of @xmath11 into @xmath13 , with the three doublets of @xmath11 coalescing into a sextet of @xmath13 .",
    "most of the new gauge bosons are arranged to be heavy @xmath14@xmath15 so as to avoid sizable fcnc .",
    "@xmath13 can be naturally broken into @xmath11 through a chain of symmetry breakings .",
    "the breakdown @xmath16 ^ 3 \\rightarrow su(2)_l$ ] can be induced by two antisymmetric higgs which tranform as @xmath17 under @xmath18 .",
    "the standard @xmath11 is to be identified with the diagonal @xmath19 subgroup of @xmath20 ^ 3=su(2)_1\\otimes su(2)_2\\otimes su(2)_3 $ ] , where @xmath21 operates on the @xmath22th generation exclusively . in terms of the @xmath21 gauge boson @xmath23 ,",
    "the @xmath11 gauge bosons are given by @xmath24 .",
    "of the other orthogonal combinations of @xmath23 , @xmath25 , which exhibits unversality only among the first two generations , can have a mass scale in the tev range @xcite .",
    "the three gauge bosons @xmath26 will be denoted as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "given these extra gauge bosons with mass in the tev range , we can expect small deviations from the sm .",
    "some of these effects were already analyzed elsewhere .",
    "for ew precision tests , the dominant effects of new heavier gauge boson @xmath29 show up in its mixing with the standard @xmath30 to form the mass eigenstates @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is identified with the physical @xmath34 . here",
    ", the mixing angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are expected to be small @xmath37 , assuming that they scale as some powers of mass ratios .    with the additional gauge boson @xmath27 , the neutral - current lagrangian is generalized to contain an additional term @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the neutral currents @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 as in sm , @xmath47 for the first two generations and @xmath48 for the third . here",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the third component of weak isospin and electric charge of fermion @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "and the neutral - current lagrangian reads in terms of @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the vector and axial - vector couplings of fermion @xmath51 to physical gauge boson @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath57 similar analysis can be carried out in the charged sector .",
    "it is now well known that ew parameters become consistent with the data only if the ew radiative corrections are accounted for .",
    "for example , the predictions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , obtained from various measurements at @xmath60 and low - energy @xmath61 scattering experiments are consistent only if one - loop effects are included .",
    "there are several different schemes to parametrize the ew vacuum polarization corrections @xcite .",
    "it can be easily shown that by expanding the vacuum polarization tensors to order @xmath62 , one obtains three independent physical parameters .",
    "alternatively , one can show that upon symmetry breaking there are three additional terms in the effective lagrangian @xcite . in the @xmath63 scheme @xcite , the deviations of the model predictions from those of the sm ( with fixed values of @xmath64 )",
    "are considered to be as the effects from  new physics \" .",
    "this scheme is only valid to the lowest order in @xmath62 , and is therefore not viable for a theory with new , light @xmath65 particles . in the @xmath9-scheme , on the other hand , the model predictions are absolute and are valid up to higher orders in @xmath62 , and therefore this scheme is better suited to the ew precision tests of the mssm@xcite and a class of supergravity models @xcite .",
    "here we choose to use the @xmath9-scheme because the new particles in the model to be considered here can be relatively light @xmath66 . in this scheme , three independent physical parameters @xmath67 @xcite correspond to a set of observables @xmath68 and @xmath69 . among these three parameters , only @xmath70 provides very strong constraint , for example , in supersymmetric models@xcite .",
    "the expressions for @xmath67 are given as @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the following combinations of vacuum polarization amplitudes @xmath73\\;,\\\\ e_2&=&f_{ww}(m_w^2)-{\\alpha\\over 4\\pi s^2}f_{33}(m_z^2)\\;,\\\\ e_3&=&{\\alpha\\over 4\\pi s^2}[f_{3q}(m_z^2)-f_{33}(m_z^2)]\\;,\\\\ e_4&=&f_{\\gamma\\gamma}(0)-f_{\\gamma\\gamma}(m_z^2)\\;,\\\\ e_5&= & m_z^2f^\\prime_{zz}(m_z^2)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath74 contributions @xmath75 are defined by ^ij_t(q^2)=^ij_t(0)+q^2f_ij(q^2 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath76 are the contributions to the vector and axial - vector form factors at @xmath77 in the @xmath78 vertex from proper vertex diagrams and fermion self - energies , and @xmath79 comes from the one - loop box , vertex and fermion self - energy corrections to the @xmath80-decay amplitude at zero external momentum .",
    "it is important to note that these non - oblique corrections are non - negligible , and must be included in order to obtain an accurate gauge - invariant prediction@xcite .",
    "however , we have included the standard non - oblique corrections only , neglecting justifiably the small effects from the new physics . in the following section we calculate @xmath81 in the @xmath8 model .",
    "we do not , however , include @xmath82 in our analysis simply because these parameters can not provide any constraints at the current level of experimental accuracy@xcite .",
    "we assume throughout the analysis that the non - oblique contributions from new physics to the measurables that are included in the global fit are negligible .",
    "although loop corrections due to extra gauge bosons could be neglected completely as in ref@xcite , we have improved the model prediction for the oblique corrections by implementing the new vertices from eq .",
    "( 6 ) for the fermion loops only . in this way we have accounted for a significant deviation of the model prediction from the sm value for",
    "not so small @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , in models with extra gauge bosons such as the model to be considered here , the contribution from the mixings of these extra bosons with the sm ones @xmath84 should also be added to @xmath70@xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the model prediction for the z width , it is sufficient for our purposes to resort to the improved born approximation ( iba)@xcite , neglecting small additional effects from the new physics .",
    "weak corrections can be effectively included within the iba , wherein the vector couplings of all the fermions are determined by an effective weak mixing angle . in the case",

    "@xmath94 above is obtained by accounting for qcd corrections up to 3-loop order in @xmath95 scheme , and we ignore different qcd corrections for vector and axial - vector couplings which are due not only to chiral invariance broken by masses but also the large mass splitting between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we use for the vector and axial vector couplings @xmath98 and @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) the effective @xmath100 , @xmath101 . in the case of @xmath102 ,",
    "the large @xmath97 vertex correction should be accounted for by the following replacement @xmath103    in the following analysis , we use the recent experimental value , @xmath104 , obtained from a global fit to lep data on @xmath105 and @xmath69 measurement@xcite .",
    "we consider not only a constraint on the deviation of @xmath106 from the sm prediction@xcite , @xmath107  mev , which is the present experimental accuracy@xcite , but also the present experimental bound on @xmath108 .",
    "we use a direct model - independent bound on @xmath108 , @xmath109 from @xmath110 and @xmath111@xcite .",
    "the values @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 will be used thoughout the numerical analysis .    in fig .  1 we present the regions in the @xmath115 plane excluded by all the constraints to be imposed here for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "an excluded region shaded by horizontal lines represents the @xmath70 constraint at @xmath119c .",
    "l. whereas the one by vertical lines corresponds to @xmath120 and @xmath108 constraints .",
    "we observe in fig .  1 that @xmath70 starts cutting in the region ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) still allowed by the other constraints even at @xmath123 . similarly in fig .  2 we also show the excluded regions for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126",
    "it s very interesting for one to see two small disconnected allowed regions in the figure .",
    "we find here that @xmath127 and @xmath128 in one region whereas @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the other .",
    "the way that values for @xmath131 and @xmath132 are chosen originates from constraint due to @xmath108 . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the model predicts @xmath70 without @xmath108 too high to be allowed at @xmath119c .",
    "l. for @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the model parameters including @xmath131 and @xmath132 are chosen in such a way that @xmath108 brings @xmath70 down to or below the lep bound at @xmath119c .",
    "l. this is fulfilled only if @xmath135 . however , for @xmath123 , @xmath135 or @xmath136 are allowed because now @xmath70 lies always within the lep bounds for @xmath134 . for @xmath136",
    ", @xmath108 brings @xmath70 up to the lep upper limit@xmath137 at @xmath119c .",
    "l. while for @xmath135 it brings @xmath70 down to the lep lower limit@xmath138 . since the contour lines for the one choice are more or less those for the other choice with @xmath139 rotation around zero , we present in fig",
    ".  1 only one choice , @xmath136 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath133 , there are in fact two pairs of contour lines for @xmath70 constraint .",
    "the pairs come from either the lep upper limit or the lower limit because @xmath70 can also go below the lower limit because of a large negative constribution from @xmath108 for large mixing angles .",
    "in this work we have concentrated on the constraints placed on the @xmath8 family model from precision lep measurements . as has been the cae with similar studies ,",
    "the model is severely constrained .",
    "the most important effects of the model come from mixings of the sm gauge bosons @xmath86 and @xmath140 with the additional gauge bosons @xmath27 and @xmath141 .",
    "we have computed the one loop ew radiative corrections due to the new bosons in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath120 . using a global fit to lep data on @xmath105 and @xmath69 measurement , we find that the mixing angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constrained to lie in rather small regions .",
    "also , larger ( @xmath142 ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 values are allowed only when there is considerable cancellation between the @xmath27 and @xmath141 contributions , corresponding to @xmath143 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the results are sensitive to the top quark mass . for small @xmath144 @xmath145 ,",
    "the allowed parameter regions are considerably bigger than those for larger @xmath144 @xmath146 values .",
    "hopefully , when the top quark mass becomes available , we can narrow down the mixing angles with considerable precision .",
