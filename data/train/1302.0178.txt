    "an essential ingredient of the thermohaline circulation is the mechanism by which the denser water that was produced in the high latitude regions ( colder and saltier ) , once it has flowed down the continental slopes towards the abyssal ocean , can come back to the surface to close the loop .",
    "this process involves an energy input to provide the gain of potential energy necessary to lift this denser water .",
    "it is believed that turbulent mixing , generated by wind and tides , is the mechanism that performs this task  @xcite .",
    "one possible way is via the breaking of internal gravity waves  @xcite , ubiquitous in the ocean , allowing a transfer of energy from large scales to small scales , where this energy is partly dissipated in heat and partly converted in potential energy through diapycnal mixing .",
    "the importance of these four possible dissipative processes has to be estimated and compared precisely .",
    "it is likely that a combination of them might be the correct answer but the usual physicists approach , aiming at separating the different processes one by one , is presumably appropriate in a first stage .",
    "parametric subharmonic instability ( psi ) is the resonant mechanism by which a primary wave is unstable to infinitesimal perturbations , transferring energy through the quadratic nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equation to two secondary waves , satisfying temporal and spatial resonant conditions .",
    "more precisely , psi is the class of resonant wave - wave interactions wherein energy is transferred from large scale to smaller scales and where the frequencies of the secondary waves are near half the primary frequency .",
    "studying the particular case of a primary plane wave is very interesting since a plane wave is solution of the full inviscid nonlinear equation for any amplitude .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , this solution becomes unstable above a given threshold , which can be computed analytically  @xcite .",
    "initially , this instability was considered only for the gravity or capillary waves  ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite proved that this instability could be observed in many physical systems , and in particular for internal waves . following this initial report ,",
    "several theoretical studies have been developed for this phenomenon , deriving in particular the expression for the growth rate in presence ( or absence ) of viscosity  @xcite . at the same time , the first experimental observations of the instability have been reported  @xcite .",
    "these first observations allowed the amplitude threshold of the instability and the temporal evolution of the secondary waves amplitude . with the of more powerful computers ,",
    "numerical simulations have been developed on this subject  @xcite to estimate the energy transfer between the different scales and to determine different scaling laws .",
    "finally , only very recently new experiments using a vertical mode-1 wave have been performed by  @xcite , allowing the frequencies and the wave vectors of the secondary waves and to compare theses measurements to the viscous theory .",
    "note that a study of psi in the very similar context of inertial waves in a rotating fluid has recently been reported by  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive study of two - dimensional parametric subharmonic instability .",

    "an internal wave is generated using a wave generator similar to the one employed in previous experiments , described in  @xcite and characterized in  @xcite .",
    "the generator is composed of stacked plates set in motion thanks to eccentered cams rotating inside the plates at constant frequency around a shaft .",
    "the motion of these plates imposes a moving boundary condition generating the desired wave .",
    "the main difference with the generator described previously is that the present version allows the eccentricity of each cam to be varied .",
    "the same set of cams can therefore be used to generate different profiles , as well as identical profiles with different amplitudes . in the experiments presented here ,",
    "the wave generated is a plane wave of wavelength @xmath3=72 mm . in this case , the generator is placed horizontally as shown in fig .",

    "note that to avoid spurious emission of internal waves on the extremities of the moving region , the amplitude of the plates is constant over two wavelengths in the central region , while one half - wavelength with a smooth decrease of the amplitude is added on each sides .    .",

    "the civx algorithm  @xcite computes the cross - correlation between the real - time and the @xmath11 background images , when the fluid is at rest .",
    "this algorithm gives the variation of the horizontal , @xmath12 , and vertical , @xmath13 , density gradients , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the instantaneous and initial fluid densities .      in an experimental configuration where the tank is filled with a linear stratification producing a frequency @xmath16 rad",

    "it is interesting to notice that although the two secondary frequencies seem to shift slightly in the long time range , the resonance condition prevails .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the two secondary waves seems to decrease after some time .",
    "two other frequencies , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , have non vanishing contributions to the signal .",
    "the first one corresponds to the mean flow generated by the plates of the wave generator via an archimedes screw type of entrainment . a second possible source of mean flow",
    "could be the reflection of the primary wave at the bottom of the tank .",

    "it must be noted that the amplitude of the primary plane wave is not constant on the entire beam because of the viscous damping .",

    "this amplitude can not be obtained directly from the amplitude of oscillation of the generator plates , since there is a conversion factor between both described by  @xcite .",
    "this factor is not well known , and strongly depends on the wave frequency , because of the change of angle it implies of the wave propagation , while the generator motion is only vertical .",
    "for this reason , @xmath100 has to be measured experimentally , introducing an experimental error in the prediction .",
    "it leads to a theoretical prediction for the growth rate @xmath155 s@xmath147 , while the experimental measurement gives @xmath156 s@xmath157 .",

    "it leaves unchanged the shape of the growth rate evolution with @xmath133 and @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ growthratesenfonctiondekappaetomega ] ) .",
    "the only effect of an increase of @xmath136 is an increase of the overall value of the growth rate .",
    "for this reason , it was not necessary to perform a systematic experimental study of the dependence of the growth rate with  @xmath136 .    in a first part",
    ", we will discuss the dependence with the primary wave frequency @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ kth ] shows the evolution with @xmath34 of the ( normalized ) norms @xmath133 and @xmath158 of the secondary waves corresponding to the maximum growth rate .",

    "these curves are obtained in the case where the primary wave amplitude is fixed at the value of the experimental run described in section  [ observ ] .",
    "we can observe that in this case , when the secondary wave vectors belong to the external branches , there exist a range of frequency ( for @xmath159 ) where the secondary wavelengths are both smaller than the primary wavelength , corresponding to an energy transfer to smaller scales . on the contrary ,",
    "when the secondary wave vectors belong to the central part of the resonance loci ( dashed - dotted lines ) , one of the secondary wavelengths is always larger than the primary wavelength , while the other is smaller , allowing for energy transfer to both smaller and larger scales .     and @xmath160 with the pulsation @xmath5 for a fixed amplitude .",

    "the thick part of curves represent the region where the growth rate is larger in this configuration , compared to the other . ]    out of these two sets of secondary wave vectors , the one which corresponds to the largest growth rate is illustrated on the graph by a thicker line .",
    "there is therefore a transition frequency ( in this case around @xmath161 ) for which the instability `` jumps '' from one solution to the other .",
    "as mentioned , this change in behavior is observed for a given value of the amplitude  @xmath100 . as this amplitude varies ,",
    "the transition frequency changes .",
    "figure  [ diagphase ] shows ( solid line ) the evolution of this transition frequency as a function of the amplitude . above this curve , the secondary waves are selected on the outer region of the resonance loci , while below the curve the secondary waves are selected in the central zone .    on the same figure",
    ", we superimposed the experimental points obtained for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath100 , showing in which cases the parametric subharmonic instability ( psi ) was observed .",
    "three different wave generator amplitudes were used to produce these series of points ( cam eccentricities of @xmath162 , @xmath23 and @xmath163  cm ) .",
    "these three series correspond to the three almost vertical series of black symbols on the graph .",
    "one must keep in mind that the wave amplitude is computed from the measured signals , therefore a fixed amplitude of the wave generator does not correspond exactly to a fixed wave amplitude .    )",
    "observed psi , ( + ) no apparent psi . ]",
    "it can be noted that for large enough excitation amplitudes , psi is observed , but mostly above the transition line .",
    "actually , after careful observation , it turns out that the two points with psi below this line are also case of psi with wave vectors on the external branches of the resonance loci .",
    "this feature may be related to the uncertainty on the frequency selection mentioned in section [ wv ] .",
    "our guess is that psi can not develop in the present experimental tank when one of the secondary waves has a larger wavelength than the primary wave .",
    "no cascade to larger scale is allowed .",
    "the reason for this behavior could be the too small number of wavelengths which is excited by the generator .    for the smallest excitation amplitude , no psi was observed during the recording , . equation  ( [ eq_lambda ] ) shows that unstable solutions are possible only if the amplitude of the primary wave exceeds a viscous threshold value given by @xmath164 .",
    "however , the excitation amplitude is one or two orders of magnitude larger than this viscous threshold which can not explain the absence of the instability .",
    "this behavior could again be related to the size of the expected wavelengths at this amplitude .",
    "indeed , it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ kth ] that the lower solid line crosses the ordinate 1 at a given frequency .",
    ", below this frequency , a transfer to larger scales is involved .",
    "we have computed theoretically , as a function of the wave amplitude , the threshold frequency under which it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ diagphase ] as a dashed line .",
    "the small amplitude series , where no psi is observed , happens to be on the left of this line , therefore in the region involving transfer to larger scales . as in the case of small frequencies , this might explain the absence of observed psi .",
    "using a synthetic schlieren technique in a linearly stratified fluid , we have observed the production , from a primary internal plane wave , of two secondary waves of smaller frequency and wavelength .",
    "the mechanism at play is a 3-wave resonant interaction , satisfying a temporal resonance condition for the three pulsations @xmath165 and a spatial resonance condition for the three wave vectors , @xmath54 .",
    "this resonant interaction can be developed analytically , in order to produce theoretical predictions that we compare to our measurements , which are derived from applying a time - frequency spectrum and a hilbert transform to our data .",
    "a good agreement was found for the wave vectors of the secondary waves , as well as for the instability growth rate .",
    "the relevance of psi for oceanic internal waves has been recently renewed by several numerical simulations with realistic conditions ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) , which have been followed by very interesting field measurements which also pointed to the presence of psi activity in the ocean .",
    "one might in particular refer to measurements close to hawaii by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , in the ocean , due to the large spatial scales , the role of viscosity is reduced compared to the experiment . in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider a typical oceanic internal wave , measured in situ by observing the periodic oscillations of isotherms ( see figure 1 in  @xcite or figure 6.13 in  @xcite ) .",
    "theses oscillations have an amplitude of about 20 m , with a period of about half a day .",
    "ocean internal waves typically have wavelengths from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers @xcite : as a typical value , we shall take 1000 m. compared to our experiment , it yields an amplitude of the stream function @xmath100@xmath166 about four orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we therefore recomputed as an example ( see fig .",
    "[ psi_ocean ] ) the curves of fig .",
    "[ wavevectors](b ) , as well as the corresponding plots as a function of the wave frequency , for an amplitude 10000 times larger than the experiment . as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ psi_ocean](a ) , the most unstable mode corresponds to the situation where the norm of both secondary wave vectors are much larger ( 10 to 20 times in our example ) than the norm of the primary wave vector , leading to @xmath167 and correspondingly ( fig .",
    "[ psi_ocean](b ) ) to @xmath168 .",
    "this is what led historically to call this resonant interaction \" parametric subharmonic instability  , because of the similarity with parametric instability , like that occurring for a pendulum with oscillating suspension .     as a function of the wave vector modulus  @xmath133 in panel ( a ) and as a function of the wave frequency @xmath38 in panel ( b ) for typical oceanic parameters ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of the wave vector modulus  @xmath133 in panel ( a ) and as a function of the wave frequency @xmath38 in panel ( b ) for typical oceanic parameters ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in our experimental tank , with dimensions orders of magnitude smaller than in the ocean , we observe that viscosity has a much larger effect on the selection of the unstable modes . indeed , because of viscosity , @xmath133 and @xmath158 are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath136 . in addition , a second effect of viscosity is to allow two different behaviors for the instability .",
    "first , the instability can generate two new internal waves whose wavelengths are smaller than the primary wavelength .",
    "we have then an energetic transfer to smaller scales , as is the case in the ocean . but",
    "theoretically , when @xmath169 is small enough , the instability can also generate two secondary internal waves with one of the wavelengths larger than the primary wavelength , and the other one smaller . in this case",
    ", the energetic transfer will be to larger and smaller scales simultaneously .",
    "however , we never observed experimentally this second behavior , although it was expected from the analytical study .",
    "we observe the instability , on a plane wave , only when the theory predicts two smaller wavelengths .",
    "it is possible that the finite size of the beam impedes the development of the secondary wave , which has a larger wavelength",
    ". it could be interesting to perform some numerical simulations , with a confined beam to confirm this behavior .",
    "another issue that needs to be discussed is the physical location of the birth of the secondary waves . in all",
    "the experiments performed , the instability appears first in a region very close to the wave generator .",
    "this is understandable because it is the location where the primary wave first appears and where its amplitude is maximum .",
    "then it occupies the whole volume .",
    "in addition to the importance of the mechanism for the dissipation of waves , an effect on the background media in which waves are propagating can be expected : indeed , the primary wave could give rise through this instability to two secondary waves which are above the overturn threshold .",
    "because of the latter , the stratification will evolve through these mixing events , influencing through this feedback effect the threshold for the mechanism itself .",
