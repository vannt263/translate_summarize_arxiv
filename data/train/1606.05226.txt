    "observations of thermal emission from neutron stars ( ns ) provides information about the magnetic field strength and configuration , temperature , chemical composition of the outer regions , and about the properties of matter at higher densities , deeper inside the star see  @xcite,@xcite . to derive this information",
    ", we need to calculate the structure and evolution of the star , and compare theoretical models with observational data .",
    "x - ray observations of thermal emission show periodic variabilities in single neutron stars  @xcite , indicating to the anisotropic temperature distribution",
    ". it is produced at the low and intermediate density regions , such as the solid crust , where a complicated magnetic field geometry could cause a coupled magneto - thermal evolution . in some extreme cases , with a very high magnetic field ,",
    "this anisotropy may even be present in the poorly known interior , where neutrino processes are responsible for the energy removal @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of these nss in broad range from optics to x - ray band , can not be reproduced by a spectrum of the surface with a unique temperature .",
    "fitting of the spectrum of the x - ray source @xmath1 in this broad region is explained  @xcite by a small hot emitting area @xmath2 @xmath3 , and an extended cooler component .",
    "another piece of evidence that strongly supports the nonuniform temperature distribution are pulsations in the x - ray signal of some objects of amplitudes @xmath4 , some of which have irregular light curves that point towards a non - dipolar temperature distribution @xcite .",
    "heat transfer in the envelopes of ns plays crucial role in many aspects of evolution of these stars .",
    "thermal conductivity is the basic quantity needed for calculating the relationship between the internal temperature of a neutron star and its effective surface temperature .",
    "this relationship affects thermal evolution of the neutron star and its radiation spectra . to calculate thermal conductivity",
    "we should know the transport properties of a dense matter where electrons are degenerate , and form a nearly ideal fermi - gas @xcite .",
    "the ions are usually treated as non - degenerate",
    ". they may be in a gaseous state , may form a coulomb liquid or a coulomb crystal @xcite . under such conditions , electrons are the most important heat carriers , and the thermal conductivity is determined by electron motion .",
    "the magnetic field limits the motion of electrons in directions perpendicular to the field lines and , since they are the main carriers of the heat transport , the thermal conductivity in these directions is suppressed , while remaining unaffected along the field lines .",
    "the conductivity of electrons in ns and white dwarfs in presence of a magnetic field was studied in  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the ratio between thermal conductivity along and across magnetic field lines considered in @xcite was taken as    @xmath5    and was used also in @xcite . here",

    "the influence of the magnetic field on the electron heat conductivity in the form ( [ firstone ] ) was used in subsequent papers , see  @xcite ,  @xcite . here",
    "we find an analytic solution for the heat conductivity tensor of strongly degenerate electrons in a magnetic field , in the lorentz approximation , which is asymptotically exact in this case , showing a more complicated dependence on the magnetic field strength than ( [ firstone ] ) .",
    "classical methods of kinetic gas theory were developed by maxwell , boltzmann , gilbert , enskog and chapman .",

    "they are based on the solution of the boltzmann equation by method of successive approximations . as a zeroth approximation , the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution function",
    "is taken , which is a maxwell distribution for a non - degenerate gas , and a fermi - dirac distribution in cases when degeneracy is important .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function is not an exact solution of boltzmann equation in presence of non - uniformity .",
    "following @xcite we look for a solution of the boltzmann equation in the first approximation by sonyne ( laguerre ) polynomial expansion , valid for a non - degenerate gas .",
    "to take into account a degeneracy , we use a set of orthogonal functions , as a generalization of sonyne polynomials , suggested in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "only two first terms of this expansion are taken often for calculations of the heat conductivity coefficients .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this approximation gives substantial errors for the coefficient of a heat conductivity , which become much smaller when 3 polynomial expansion is used .",
    "here we calculate the heat conductivity tensor in a magnetic field using 3 terms of the expansion .",
    "we show the improvement of the precision , when mowing from 2 to 3 polynomials , on the example of the non - magnetized lorentz gas , where an exact solution is known .",
    "the first application of the boltzmann equation to the gas of charged particles was made by chapman  @xcite . due to the divergence of the collision integral at large impact parameters for particles with the coulomb interaction , the upper limit of integration over the impact parameter",
    "was taken at the length of the average distance between particles .",
    "thus the coefficients of viscosity , heat conductivity and diffusion of gases composed of charged particles were obtained .",
    "divergence of the collision integral for coulomb interaction at large impact parameter shows that the scattering with large impact parameters and small change of momentum in one collision play more important role than collisions with big change of the momentum .",
    "landau used this fact to simplify the boltzmann collision integral @xcite .",
    "he expanded distribution function after collision in small variations of momentum and left first two terms . the integral",
    "obtained in this way is called landau collision integral .",
    "another derivation of the landau collision integral was done by chandrasekhar @xcite , who used the analog with the brownian motion , described by the fokker - planck equation . the identity between landau and fokker - planck collision integrals",

    "landau collision integral was used , and two polynomials were taken into account in the expansion . the same approach , was used in  @xcite , where calculations of kinetic coefficients for a fully ionized plasma of a complex composition have been performed .",
    "coefficients of the heat conductivity tensor in a degenerate stellar cores were calculated in lorentz approximation for a hydrogen plasma in @xcite . a nonrelativistic calculation , based on on the quantum lenard - balescu transport equation for the thermal and electrical conductivity of plasma of highly degenerate , weakly coupled electrons and nondegenerate , weakly coupled ions was performed in @xcite .",
    "shear viscosities of non - relativistic , relativistic and ultra - relativistic hard sphere gas were calculated by chapman - enskog method in @xcite,@xcite    the present work is devoted to the solution of the boltzmann equation by chapman - enskog method for electrons in an arbitrary degenerate plasma .",
    "we find a tensor of the heat conductivity using the expansion in two and three polynomials , and , on the example of the lorentz gas , we show that the method has a good convergence to the exact solution .",
    "we obtain , for the first time , in three polynomial approximation , with account of electron - electron collisions , analytical expressions for the heat conductivity tensor for non - degenerate electrons , in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "account of the third polynomial improved substantially the precision of results . in two polynomial approximation",
    "our solution coincides with the published results .    for strongly degenerate electrons",
    "we obtain , for the first time , an asymptotically exact analytical solution for the heat conductivity tensor in presence of a magnetic field .",
