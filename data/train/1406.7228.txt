    "the lhcb collaboration measured the @xmath1 decays into @xmath2 and @xmath8 and observed a pronounced peak for the @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "simultaneously the signal for the @xmath3 was found very small or non - existent .",
    "the belle collaboration followed suit and reported similar results @xcite , providing absolute rates for the @xmath4 production with a branching ratio of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "results of this order of magnitude have been predicted using light cone qcd sum rules under the factorization assumption @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration corroborated these latter results in @xcite .",
    "further confirmation was provided by the d0 collaboration in @xcite .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has brought much information into the topic and in @xcite results are provided for the @xmath10 decay into @xmath2 @xmath4 followed by the @xmath8 decays of the @xmath4 .",
    "once again the @xmath4 production is seen clearly while no evident signal is seen for the @xmath3 .",
    "the interesting thing is that in the analogous decay of @xmath11 into @xmath2 and @xmath8 @xcite a signal is seen for the @xmath3 production and only a very small fraction is observed for the @xmath4 production , with a relative rate of about ( 1 - 10)% with respect to that of the @xmath3 .",
    "research has followed in the same collaboration and in @xcite the @xmath10 into @xmath2 and @xmath8 is investigated .",
    "once again a clear peak is observed for @xmath4 production , while @xmath3 production is not observed .",
    "the @xmath11 into @xmath2 and @xmath8 is further investigated in @xcite with a clear contribution from the @xmath3 and no signal for the @xmath4 .",
    "such striking behavior has served the authors of @xcite to conduct a theoretical study in which they discuss the repercussions of assuming the @xmath4 and @xmath3 to be @xmath12 states or tetraquarks . on the other hand ,",
    "the last fifteen years have witnessed a spectacular advance in our understanding of the low energy scalar mesons , made possible by the studies of chiral perturbation theory @xcite complemented by the requirement of exact unitarity in coupled channels @xcite . for the case of the scalar mesons",
    "it was found that the treatment of the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons using chiral unitary theory gave rise to the appearance of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances in a natural way , leading to what is called dynamically generated resonances @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been largely and successfully tested in a variety of reactions where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are produced .",
    "this is the case of @xcite for the @xmath2 decay into @xmath13 and a pair or mesons , where the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath14 production is well reproduced , the @xmath15 reaction @xcite , the @xmath16 reaction @xcite , the @xmath17 where different signals for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 are observed depending on the reaction @xcite and many others .",
    "the works of @xcite , where explicit consideration of final state interaction of the @xmath18 is taken into account , are also used in weak decays of @xmath7 mesons , concretely the @xmath19 decay @xcite .",
    "other related papers are those of @xcite , where the @xmath20 reaction is studied and the @xmath4 is treated as a @xmath5 state , or the one of @xcite that studies the @xmath21 , where the amplitude is parametrized and fitted to data .",
    "the @xmath20 reaction is also studied in @xcite , again parametrizing the amplitude and discussing about the @xmath4 nature as a @xmath5 or a tetraquark state .",
    "the idea that we exploit here is to take the dominant mechanism for the weak decay of the @xmath7 s into @xmath2 and a primary @xmath5 pair , which is @xmath22 for @xmath0 decay and @xmath23 for @xmath1 decay .",
    "after this , the @xmath5 pair is allowed to hadronize into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons and only the relative weights of the different pairs of mesons is needed .",
    "once the production of these meson pairs has been achieved , they are allowed to interact , for what chiral unitary theory in coupled channels is used , and automatically the @xmath3 , @xmath4 resonances are produced .",
    "we are then able to evaluate ratios of these productions in the different decays studied and we find indeed a striking dominance of the @xmath3 in the @xmath0 decay and of the @xmath4 in the @xmath1 decay in a very good quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we take the dominant weak mechanism for @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays ( the case is the same for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays ) which we depict in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig1],title=\"fig:\",height=120 ]    the differences between the two processes are : ( i ) @xmath29 appears in the @xmath30 vertex in @xmath11 decay while @xmath31 appears for the case of the @xmath10 decay , where @xmath29,@xmath31 are the matrix elements of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix ; ( ii ) one has a @xmath27 primary final hadron state in @xmath11 decay and @xmath28 in @xmath10 decay .",
    "yet , one wishes to have @xmath8 in the final state as in the experiments . for this",
    "we need the hadronization .",
    "this is easily accomplished : schematically this process is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , and adds an extra @xmath26 pair with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath32 .",
    "next step corresponds to writing the @xmath33 combination in terms of pairs of mesons . for this purpose",
    "we follow the work of @xcite and define the @xmath26 matrix @xmath34 , @xmath35 which has the property @xmath36    .[fig : fig2],height=79 ]    now , in terms of mesons the matrix @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is actually @xmath39 ( we shall come back to this ) .",
    "corresponds to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the singlet of su(3 ) . in chiral perturbation theory",
    "the @xmath41 term is removed since it does not lead to any interaction . here",
    "we should keep it to match the @xmath34 matrix , but , in as much as the @xmath41 is essentially the @xmath42 state , since the mass of @xmath42 is much bigger than any one of the octet , we can neglect the @xmath41 and work with the ordinary @xmath43 matrix . ] hence , in terms of two pseudoscalars we have the correspondence : @xmath44    we can see that @xmath8 is only obtained in the first step in the @xmath11 decay and not in @xmath10 decay .",
    "however , upon rescattering of @xmath45 we also can get @xmath8 in the final state , as we shall see . yet , knowing that the @xmath4 couples strongly to @xmath45 and the @xmath3 to @xmath46 , the meson - meson decomposition of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) already tells us that the @xmath11 decay will be dominated by @xmath3 production and @xmath10 decay by @xmath4 production .",
    "the quantitative evaluation is done below .",

    "the matrix elements projecting into @xmath68-wave are @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the pion decay constant and the unitary normalization @xmath71 , @xmath72 has been taken to easily account for the identity of the particles when using the @xmath73 function without an extra factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bseq ] ) . the good normalization of the @xmath74 matrices must be restored in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .    in @xcite",
    "only the @xmath75 , channels were considered , while here , as in @xcite , we also include the @xmath64 channel .",
    "the threshold of this channel is far away from the @xmath3 and not so much from the @xmath4 .",
    "the results obtained with or without the @xmath64 channel are very similar but the cutoff needed with two channels is @xmath76 , while it is @xmath77 for the three channels .",
    "the effective inclusion of new channels by means of a change in the cutoff is common place in coupled channels problems .",
    "another point to consider is that in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vkernel ] ) one is assuming the physical @xmath38 to be @xmath39 of su(3 ) , however , there is a small mixing with the singlet @xmath42 .",
    "one has the @xmath78 .",
    "since the @xmath41 has null interaction with the chiral lagrangians , one must multiply the matrix elements of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vkernel ] ) by @xmath79 for each @xmath38 involved in the process .",
    "since @xmath80 @xcite , the effect of the mixing is very small but we take it into account .    in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) we made use of the fact that both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 appear in relative @xmath81 meson - meson orbital angular momentum , and then @xmath46 in the final state selects @xmath82 , hence , the @xmath83 intermediate state does not contribute .",
    "note also that with respect to the weights of the meson - meson components in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) we have added a factor @xmath84 for the propagation of the @xmath65 and @xmath64 states which involve identical particles .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath31 ckm matrix elements are in this case related to the cabbibo angle , @xmath85 one final element of information is needed to complete the formula for @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the @xmath8 invariant mass , which is the fact that in a @xmath88 transition we shall need an @xmath89 for the @xmath2 to match angular momentum conservation .",
    "hence , @xmath90 , and we assume @xmath91 to be constant ( equal to @xmath92 in the calculations ) .",
    "thus , @xmath93 where the factor @xmath94 is coming from the integral of @xmath95 and @xmath96 is @xmath97 , which depends on the @xmath8 invariant mass . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dgamma ] ) @xmath98 is the @xmath2 momentum in the global cm frame ( @xmath99 at rest ) and @xmath100 is the pion momentum in the @xmath8 rest frame , @xmath101",
    "in fig .  [ fig : dgammabs ] we show the @xmath8 invariant mass distribution for the case of the @xmath102 decay .",
    "we compare our results with the data of @xcite where more statistics has been accumulated than in the earlier run of @xcite .",
    "the data are collected in bins of 20 mev .",
    "thus , we fold our mass distributions with the size of the bins , and compare the results obtained with those in fig .  14 of @xcite . the data points , given in events per bin in the experimental paper , are normalized here to match the theoretical strength at the peak of the distribution .",
    "we can see that the agreement is quantitatively good .",
    "we observe an appreciable peak for @xmath4 production and basically no trace for @xmath3 production . at lower invariant masses both the theory and experiment show a very small strength , with the theory below the data .",
    "the agreement is even better with the dashed line in fig .",
    "14 of @xcite where a small background has been subtracted . at invariant masses above the @xmath4 peak ,",
    "contribution from higher energy resonances , which we do not consider , is expected @xcite .",
    "the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) tells us why the @xmath3 contribution is so small .",
    "all intermediate states involved @xmath103 , have a mass in the @xmath104 region and the @xmath73 functions are small at lower energies .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of the @xmath3 to both @xmath45 and @xmath64 is also extremely small , such that the @xmath74 matrices involved have also small magnitudes .",
    "invariant mass distribution for the @xmath102 decay , with arbitrary normalization .",
    "data from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dgammabs],height=264 ]    note that in this decay we could have also @xmath2 and vector meson production , but the @xmath28 component would give @xmath43 production which does not decay to @xmath46 .",
    "the case is quite different for the @xmath105 decay , because now we can also produce @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) decay and in fact this takes quite a large fraction of the @xmath108 decay , as seen in @xcite .",
    "we plot our relative @xmath68-wave @xmath8 production for the @xmath105 decay in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgammab ] .     invariant mass distribution for the @xmath105 decay , with arbitrary normalization.[fig : dgammab],height=264 ]    we can see that the @xmath3 production is clearly dominant .",
    "the @xmath4 shows up as a small peak .",
    "the strength of the peak of the @xmath4 is about 1/3 of that of the @xmath3 . a direct comparison with the extracted results for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the partial wave analysis of @xcite ( see fig",
    ". 13 of @xcite ) is not possible because of the smallness of the @xmath4 signal , which is of the order of the fluctuations of the data and is not shown in the figure .",
    "however , a test can be done to compare the results : if we integrate the strength of the two resonances over the invariant mass distribution we find @xmath109}{{\\cal b}[\\bar b^0 \\to j/\\psi f_0(500 ) , f_0(500)\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- ] } = 0.033\\pm 0.007,\\ ] ] with an admitted 20% uncertainty from the decomposition of the strength in fig .",
    "[ fig : dgammab ] into the two resonances .",
    "the most recent experimental result is @xmath110 from @xcite which superseded the earlier one @xmath111 from @xcite .",
    "the central value that we obtain is five times bigger than the central value of the experiment in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lhcb2014 ] ) , yet , by considering the errors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lhcb2014 ] ) we get a band for the experiment of @xmath112 and our results are within this band .",
    "there is another point in our calculations worth noting . the normalization of figs .",
    "[ fig : dgammabs ] and  [ fig : dgammab ] is arbitrary but the relative size is what the theory predicts .",
    "it is easy to compute that @xmath113 this number is in agreement within errors with the band of @xmath114 that one obtains from the branching fractions of @xmath115 for @xmath116 from @xcite and @xmath117 for @xmath118 from @xcite",
    ".    added to the results obtained for many other reactions , as quoted in the introduction , the present reactions come to give extra support to the idea originated from chiral unitary theory that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances are dynamically generated from the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons and could be interpreted as a kind of molecular states of meson - meson with the largest component @xmath46 for the @xmath3 and @xmath45 for the @xmath4 .",
    "so far we have assumed that @xmath47 is constant up to the @xmath55-wave factor .",
    "actually there is a form factor for the transition that depends on the momentum transfer",
    ". then it could be different for @xmath3 or @xmath4 production . yet , in @xcite this form factor is evaluated and it is found that @xmath119 , where @xmath120 stand for the @xmath121 . in @xcite",
    "the same results are assumed , as well as in @xcite , where by analogy @xmath122 is also assumed to be unity .",
    "in addition , in @xcite it is also found from analysis of the experiment that @xmath123 is compatible with unity .",
    "these findings justify the assumption made of a constant form factor in the range of energies discussed here .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays into @xmath2 @xmath4 and @xmath2 @xmath3 and have looked at the @xmath4 and @xmath3 production in both cases .",
    "the formalism is easy to follow : starting from the dominant weak decay process we have @xmath124 production for the @xmath0 decay and @xmath125 production in the @xmath1 decay . upon hadronization into meson - meson components we realize that the @xmath22 contains @xmath46 components while the @xmath23 does not and contains mostly @xmath126 .",
    "this already hints at the dominance of @xmath3 in the @xmath0 decay and the @xmath4 in the @xmath1 decay since the @xmath3 couples mostly to @xmath46 , while the @xmath4 couples mostly to @xmath126 .",
    "we have made a quantitative study by allowing the primary produced meson - meson pairs to interact among themselves , using for this the chiral unitary approach , and then the two resonances are generated .",
    "we observe a pronounced @xmath4 peak in the @xmath46 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath1 decay and no visible trace of the @xmath3 production , like in the experiment . on the other hand , in the @xmath1 decay , both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 excitations are visible , but the @xmath4 production represents only a very small fraction of the @xmath3 , also in quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "the results obtained here add to the analysis of other reactions where both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are also produced .",
    "the systematic and accurate agreement of the predictions of chiral unitary theory with experiment is remarkable and gives a strong support to the idea of the low lying scalar mesons as being formed from the interaction of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons , qualifying as dynamically generated resonances .",
    "we would like to thank diego milanes for useful discussions and motivation to do this work , luis roca for checking part of the calculations and melahat bayar for checking the calculations and detecting a bug in the program .",
    "we also thank a. ramos for pointing up the difference of the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath43 for pseudoscalars and s. stone and l. zhang for enlightening discussions concerning the experiments .",
