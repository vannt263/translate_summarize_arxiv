    "the unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution of _ chandra  _ has been utilized by wang _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ; hereafter w02 @xcite ) and muno _ et al . _  ( 2003 ; hereafter m03 @xcite ) to investigate the x - ray source population of the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the w02 acis - i survey of the central 0.8@xmath0@xmath12@xmath0of the gc revealed a population of @xmath2800 previously undiscovered discrete weak sources with x - ray luminosities of @xmath3@xmath4erg@xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "m03 imaged the central 40 pc@xmath6 ( at 8 kpc ) around sgr a * , finding an additional @xmath22300 discrete point sources down to a limiting flux of @xmath7 erg / s .",
    "more recently , a deeper _ chandra  _ survey of the central @xmath21@xmath0around sgr a * has been obtained ; the combination of all of these surveys has revealed a total of @xmath810,000 discrete sources ( figure 1 ; muno _ et al . _   2008 ,",
    "hereafter m08 @xcite ) .",
    "the harder ( @xmath93 kev ) x - ray sources are likely to be at the distance of the gc , while the softer sources are likely to be foreground x - ray active stars or cvs within a few kpc of the sun .",
    "some individual sources have been identified as x - ray transients , high - mass stars , lmxbs , and cvs",
    ". however , the nature of the majority of these newly detected sources is as yet unknown .",
    "we have undertaken an ir and x - ray observational campaign to determine the nature of the faint discrete x - ray source population discovered by _",
    "chandra  _ in the gc .",
    "we have begun by cross - correlating the source catalog of muno _ et al . _  ( 2006 ; hereafter m06 @xcite ) with @xmath10images of 26 selected 2.5@xmath11@xmath6 regions obtained with isaac on the vlt to identify candidate ir counterparts to the x - ray sources @xcite .    our original search for the counterparts to the gc x - ray sources used positions obtained through private communication with the authors of the w02 survey .",
    "however , m06 re - analyzed the data and produced a significant refinement of the astrometry of the w02 data ; thus the positions reported for @xmath250% of the x - ray sources in the finalized m06 catalog showed a shift of @xmath12@xmath11  from the positions we used for our original cross - correlation analysis .",
    "this astrometric shift has a substantial impact on the identification of candidate ir counterparts , since the average stellar separation in our vlt fields is 1.94@xmath11  in @xmath13-band @xcite .",
    "in addition , the revised m06 analysis revealed that a larger number of x - ray sources were detected in the original _",
    "chandra  _ survey than had been previously cataloged . as a result",
    ", our vlt imaging survey covers 130 x - ray sources , compared to the 77 x - ray sources originally reported in @xcite .    ; _ middle , green _ : @xmath14 ; and _ right , red _ : @xmath15 .",
    "the large extension towards high values of colour ( _ right _ in each panel ) indicates that there is a significant amount of near - ir extinction.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    comparing the colours and magnitudes of the candidate counterparts to the general field populations ( figure 2 ) , we find no clearly significant difference between the magnitude distribution of candidate counterparts and those of the field population , aside a slight over - abundance of more local , bright , blue candidate counterparts ( see especially the left - hand panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "the colours indicate that the majority of potential counterparts are located at or beyond gc distances ( @xmath16 ) , with a smaller number consistent with a foreground stellar population .",
    "@xmath17 ( 40 ) of the x - ray sources that lie within the area covered by our vlt observations do not have detections within the x - ray error circle in any of the three ir bands .",
    "@xmath18 ( 76 ) of the x - ray sources had zero candidate counterpart detections in the @xmath19-band , compared to @xmath20 ( 63 ) for the @xmath21-band and only @xmath22 ( 47 ) for the @xmath23-band .    to examine the significance of these numbers of `` non - matches ''",
    ", we performed a monte carlo test .",
    "we added a random 0@xmath11 30@xmath11  shift to the position of each x - ray source , re - ran the matching of the x - ray and ir data , and recorded the number of candidate counterparts identified for the match ; we performed this test 10,000 times , having different random shifts in the x - ray position for each trial .",
    "the monte carlo test revealed that , given randomized x - ray positions , the expected fraction of x - ray sources that would have no ir counterparts across all three bands is 41.6@xmath244.3% ( @xmath25 error ) . for the actual positions , @xmath17 of x - ray sources had no candidate ir counterpart , which is @xmath26 _",
    "lower_. similarly for @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath23-bands considered individually , the monte carlo simulation revealed that the fraction of x - ray sources for which there would be no matches if the x - ray sources are randomly scattered across the fields are 64.8@xmath244.1% , 58.3@xmath244.3% and 47.5@xmath244.4% respectively .",
    "the numbers of `` non - matches '' for the _ true _ x - ray positions are thus _ lower _ than would be expected from random at the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 levels for @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath23  respectively .",
    "this result indicates that even with the extremely high ir source density in the gc , with the corrected and accurate x - ray astrometry we are now finding significantly _ more _ x - ray / ir matches than would be expected from chance coincidence .",
    "from our analysis of the vlt images , we find that the ir extinction in the gc can vary on scales as small as 5@xmath11  ( 0.2 - 0.6 pc at 8 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "some areas show little evidence of this `` granularity '' , while others are highly structured .",
    "the relationship of extinction to wavelength in the ir is a power law with slope @xmath30 @xcite ; the `` canonical '' value for @xmath30 is @xmath22 @xcite . in contrast , for the gc we find a mean value of @xmath31 ; and furthermore , along any given line of sight to the gc @xmath30 varies substantially , ranging from @xmath21.83.6 @xcite .",
    "we find that the `` universal '' ir extinction law is _ not _ universal in the gc . therefore to obtain reddening - corrected stellar photometry in the gc , a local value for the @xmath10extinction ( on scales @xmath32@xmath11 ) must be measured and applied .",
    "the primary accretion signature in the @xmath13-band which distinguishes a true x - ray counterpart from a field star is strong brackett @xmath33 emission ; this technique of identifying xrb counterparts has been verified with observations of several well - studied gc xrbs @xcite . with this technique , using spex on irtf we conclusively identified a heavily - reddened early - type star as the ir counterpart to the gc source `` edd-1 '' ( cxogc j174536.1 - 285638 ; @xcite ) . however , for an additional 16 candidate counterparts for which we obtained @xmath13-band spectra with isaac , we did not detect br-@xmath33emission .",
    "a possible explanation is that the accretion signatures could be too weak to be measureable , for example if the accretion rate was low at the time of observation , or if the emission was self - absorbed by the mass donor .",
    "however , a more likely explanation is that the stars we observed are not the true counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "our imaging survey had a limiting magnitude of @xmath13=20 , so our spectroscopic data would only detect xrbs with either early - type ( as in `` edd-1 '' ) or evolved mass donors . therefore it is likely that the majority of the true ir counterparts belong to a lower mass population of stars which includes the mass donors of cvs and lmxbs ( as has been suggested by @xcite , and other authors ) ; at gc distances , these counterparts are fainter than the limits of our survey .",
    "cross - correlation of our ir imaging of the gc with the _ chandra  _ surveys will produce a large number of ir candidate counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "due to the extremely high stellar density in the nuclear bulge , many of these astrometric `` matches '' are likely to be chance superpositions , as indicated by our initial spectroscopic data . with thousands of candidate counterparts , traditional long - slit single - target spectroscopy would be a prohibitively inefficient method by which to identify true counterparts .",
    "thus we will need to follow - up with multi - object ir spectroscopy to find the true matches : this is the work which will be performed with the flamingos-2 galactic center survey ."
