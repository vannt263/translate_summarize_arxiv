    "next generation of heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) are expected to have significant variations in traffic load between different cells and at different times . moreover , due to the massive increase in the use of smartphones and video streaming applications @xcite , an asymmetric and dynamically changing uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) traffic is expected , incurring new types of cross - link interferences . in order to cope with this challenge , it is necessary that the evolution of current wireless networks is able to accommodate asymmetric ul and dl traffic loads . while time - division duplex ( tdd ) systems @xcite have the capability of handling this asymmetry , in practice , cells operating in tdd are assumed to synchronize their ul and dl transmissions",
    "otherwise , they can suffer from a new type of interference from base stations transmitting in the opposite direction ; this is referred to as _ cross - link interference _ @xcite .",
    "basically , there are two types of interference associated with the asynchronous tdd operation , ul - to - dl interference and dl - to - ul interference , as illustrated in .",
    "dealing with cross - link interference is a key challenge for deploying dynamic tdd - based systems @xcite .",
    "for example , time - division long term evolution ( td - lte ) systems require synchronization between base stations over an overlapping coverage area @xcite .",
    "moreover , under small cell base station ( scbs ) deployment , this becomes more challenging @xcite , since cells are more likely to have strong interference coupling , especially in dense overlapping areas .",
    "besides , as centralized operation becomes difficult , small cells should self - organize to select their optimum ul / dl configuration , as a function of the interference levels , and users quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements .    the problem of dynamic ul - dl configuration in td - lte systems is studied in @xcite .",
    "therein , the prospects of dynamic tdd in td - lte systems are discussed and challenges are identified , among which interference management is seen as a major impediment . the performance of dynamic adaptation of ul and dl in lte picocell systems is also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that significant gains in packet throughput are achieved by using dynamic tdd over the synchronous td - lte .",
    "the analytical modeling of ul and dl performance under dynamic tdd is studied in @xcite using tools from stochastic geometry .",
    "a cooperative ul - dl adaptation scheme is introduced in @xcite in which two scbss serving one user each , adapt their ul / dl configuration locally relying on exchanging low - rate information .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to propose a dynamic ul / dl configuration scheme for tdd - based small cell environments in which the objective is to minimize the overall ul and dl delay in each cell and in a completely autonomous manner . in particular , the problem is formulated as a noncooprative game in which the scbss are the players . in this game",
    ", each scbs learns and estimates its current uplink and downlink delay , as a function of its traffic load , interference levels and flow - level dynamics , relying only on its instantaneous observations , and uses this estimated value to update its ul / dl switching point .",
    "a decentralized and self - organizing learning algorithm is then proposed to find an equilibrium of the game .",
    "the proposed approach is then shown to achieve considerable gains over fixed and random tdd deployments for different network sizes .",
    "in addition , our results show that the proposed algorithm is well - suited to small cell environments with large traffic dynamics .",
    "simulation results show significant packet throughput gains in case of asymmetric ul and dl traffic loads for the proposed algorithm .",
    "the gain further increases as the traffic asymmetry increases , reaching up to @xmath0 and @xmath1 gains relative to random and fixed schemes respectively .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows , in , we describe the network model and formulate the problem .",
    "introduces the proposed self - organizing ul / dl optimization scheme .",
    "simulation results are provided in .",
    "finally , concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a wireless communication system consisting of a set of small cell base stations ( scbss ) @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that a user equipment ( ue ) arrives at location @xmath3 within the considered geographical area according to a poisson arrival process with rate @xmath4 .",
    "each ue requests either a dl or ul file whose size follows an exponential distribution with mean @xmath5 .",
    "a closed - access policy is assumed in this work , meaning that each scbs has its own subscribed ues , and hence no handover is considered @xcite .",
    "we further assume @xmath6 to be the coverage area of an scbs @xmath7 , where a ue at location @xmath3 is served by an scbs @xmath7 if @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the system operates in tdd mode .",
    "a time frame consists of a number of @xmath9 subframes .",
    "a frame is divided into two portions , ul portion and dl portion .",
    "each portion consists of a group of subframes dedicated to serving either ul or dl traffic .",
    "a switching point @xmath10 is defined as the point in which scbs @xmath7 switches from ul mode to dl mode .",
    "there is a number of @xmath11 possible switching points for a frame length of @xmath9 , then @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , as illustrated in . for any of these possible switching points",
    ", there will be at least one subframe for ul and for dl in each frame .",
    "we define the vector @xmath14 $ ] as the vector of switching points for all scbss in the system .",
    "varying switching points asynchronously in different cells may cause opposite transmission directions in different cells which leads to cross - link interference ( i.e. ul - to - dl interference and dl - to - ul interference ) .",
    "consequently , the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) for ul and dl , respectively , for a receiving node at location @xmath15 is given by : @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the ul ( dl ) power from the serving node  ` b ` , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the ul ( dl ) power from the interfering node  ` j ` , @xmath22 is the channel gain , including pathloss , between the transmitting node in scbs @xmath7 and the receiving node in location @xmath15 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the sets of cells operating in ul and dl , respectively , and @xmath25 is the noise variance .",
    "furthermore , the data rates of a ue at location @xmath15 for ul and dl , respectively , are given by : @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the bandwidth allocated to that ue .",
    "the system - load density at location @xmath3 is defined as @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the load density at location @xmath3 .",
    "the _ cell load density _ for cell @xmath32 is defined as the time delay needed to serve the ul and dl traffic as follows : @xmath33",
    "where @xmath30 , @xmath34 is the ul or dl duty cycle , which is the fraction of time frames dedicated to either ul or dl service within a frame , and is expressed as follows : @xmath35    here , dividing each cell load by its respective ul or dl duration is done in order to account for the ul / dl effective traffic .",
    "therefore , lower duty cycles lead to higher delays and vice versa .",
    "our objective is to find the vector of switching points @xmath36 that minimizes the overall average flow delay by minimizing @xmath37 over the entire time frame @xcite .",
    "therefore , we define a cost function that reflects the flow delay average over the whole subframes within a timeframe , calculated as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the @xmath7-th cell load densities for the ul and dl , respectively , at subframe @xmath41 as defined in .",
    "thus , we can define the following cost optimization problem : @xmath42",
    "to solve , we develop a distributed algorithm which dynamically optimizes the ul / dl configuration .",
    "the goal is to design a decentralized algorithm that selects a vector of switching points @xmath36 that minimizes the cost function in . with the lack of global network information , the algorithm must rely only on the local information available at each scbs to optimize an _",
    "individual _ cost function rather than the global cost in .",
    "however , the cost function for each scbs depends not only on its own traffic load but also on the interference experienced from neighboring cells .",
    "therefore , each scbs @xmath7 should learn to estimate its cost function and use this estimated cost function to update its _ strategy_. here , an scbs s strategy is essentially the selection of a switching point .    in view of the interference coupling between neighboring cells ,",
    "the performance of each scbs depends not only on its choice of switching points , but on other scbss choices as well .",
    "therefore , we model this problem as a strategic noncooperative game @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the set of players ( scbss ) , in which each of them selects its action @xmath45 from a set of actions @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of possible actions , which corresponds to the number of switching points @xmath48 in our problem . for each bs @xmath49 , the corresponding cost function can be expressed as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath45 is the player s selected action and @xmath51 is the vector of other players actions .",
    "each player @xmath7 chooses an action following a mixed strategy profile @xmath52 $ ] , which is a vector of probability distributions over the set of possible actions @xmath53 .",
    "let the strategy of choosing an action @xmath45 by player @xmath7 at a time frame @xmath54 be the probability that this action is selected @xmath55 .",
    "then , by randomizing the action selection following their mixed - strategies , players aim at minimizing their long - term ( expected ) cost functions given by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the space of action profiles .    in this game , each scbs will choose the action that can lead to minimizing its cost function @xmath58 , given other players actions .",
    "we propose an algorithm that captures this behavior by adopting the gibbs sampling - based probability distribution , in which the probability of playing an action @xmath45 can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a boltzmann s temperature coefficient . from",
    ", it is clear that an action @xmath45 that yields a lower cost function will have a higher probability to be selected .",
    "moreover , @xmath60 controls the exploitation versus exploration tradeoff , in which higher values lead to frequent selection of the actions with lower cost values , which is the exploitation case , while lower @xmath61 values lead to exploring other values as well .",
    "consequently , each player will run two coupled reinforcement learning processes to estimate its cost function and strategy vector .",
    "the goal of these processes is to find the strategies that allow achieving the best long - term performance while relying only on the instantaneous observations .",
    "these two processes run in parallel and allow each scbs to build an estimate of its current cost function vector @xmath62 $ ] at time frame @xmath54 and use this estimate to update its current strategy profile vector @xmath63 .",
    "these two processes can be written @xmath64 and @xmath65 as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the instantaneous observed cost function at time @xmath68 , @xmath69 is given by , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the learning parameters , and should satisfy the following constraints @xcite : @xmath72 the proposed algorithm is illustrated in .    * the implementation at each scbs @xmath7 * * initialization * : pick a sequence of time frames @xmath73 , set @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "select an action according to the probability distribution @xmath77 .",
    "calculate the cell load according to .",
    "calculate the observed cost function .",
    "update the estimated cost for the selected action and the probability distribution vector .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this reinforcement learning process guarantees that the algorithm convergences to the logit equilibrium ( le ) @xcite .",
    "the le is a special case of @xmath78-nash equilibrium in which none of the players can decrease its cost function by more than a value @xmath78 without deviating from its current strategy . as @xmath79 ,",
    "the equilibrium coincides with the nash equilibrium .    to explain the rationale behind the le , we recall from the effect of varying the boltzmann s temperature coefficient @xmath60 . as @xmath80",
    ", the resulting mixed - strategy follows a uniform distribution , irrespective of the strategies of the other players , i.e. , @xmath81 for all @xmath82 . when @xmath83 , the result is a uniform distribution over the best actions given the strategies of the other players @xmath84 .    for a finite @xmath85 ,",
    "higher probabilities are assigned to the actions associated with low average cost and low probabilities to the actions associated with high cost values .",
    "hence if a strategy profile @xmath86 provides the following bound for the cost reduction a player might obtain by unilaterally deviating from a given mixed - strategy @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the expected cost as defined in , then @xmath89 is an le equilibrium , i.e. , an @xmath78-equilibrium with @xmath90 .",
    "this equilibrium highlights the tradeoff in choosing the value of the coefficient @xmath60 .",
    "although it follows from that a reduction in cost obtained by a player unilaterally deviating from its strategy is more likely to occur using lower values of @xmath60 , on the other hand , larger values make the @xmath78-nash equilibrium sufficiently close to the nash equilibrium , as deduced from .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the performance of the proposed dynamic tdd algorithm .",
    "to illustrate the gains of the proposed scheme , we compare it against two baseline schemes ; 1 ) _ fixed _ tdd frame , in which small cells are assumed to have the same synchronous tdd frame , with equal ul and dl duty cycle , and 2 ) _ random _ tdd frame , in which the switching point is varied randomly .",
    "we consider an arbitrary number of scbss distributed randomly , and underlaying the macrocell coverage area . in this work ,",
    "we focus only on the scbs - to - scbs co - channel interference scenario .",
    "the bandwidth is assumed to be shared between all scbss .",
    "the bandwidth is assumed to be divided equally between all ues transmitting or receiving in a given subframe .",
    "both scbss and ues are assumed to transmit with their maximum power , hence , no power control is considered in this work .",
    "we use the average packet throughput as the performance measure for different schemes , which is defined as the packet size divided by the delay encountered to complete its transmission .",
    "the motivation behind this is that it captures both packet rate and delay , which is the objective of the proposed scheme . to investigate the asymmetric ul / dl traffic , we conduct simulations for different mean ul - to - dl ratios . for example",
    ", ul - to - dl ratio of @xmath91 db means that the average rate requirement @xmath92 is the same for ul and dl .",
    "each scbs uses a sequence of time frames , no more than a maximum of @xmath93 frames to learn its load and update its ul / dl configuration accordingly .",
    "the simulation parameters are summarized in .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< \" , ]     in , we compare the packet throughput performance of our scheme against the two baseline schemes for different ul - to - dl ratios .",
    "all scbss are assumed to have the same _ average _ ul - to - dl ratios while the instantaneous traffic is different .",
    "the ul - to - dl ratio is expressed in db , for example , @xmath94 db means that @xmath95 .",
    "shows that the proposed scheme achieves significant gains reaching up to @xmath1 at @xmath96 db compared to the random scheme in all traffic conditions .",
    "moreover , this figure also shows that our approach outperforms the fixed scheme in case of asymmetric traffic conditions .",
    "the gain increases as the level of asymmetry increases , since the scbss are able to learn their ul and dl loads and adapt their transmissions accordingly .",
    "also shows that the proposed algorithm achieves up to @xmath0 gain at @xmath96 db over the fixed assignments .",
    "however , the gain becomes smaller in the symmetric traffic case in which the fixed scheme is shown to achieve the same performance since it allocates equal resources to ul and dl and hence it is suitable for symmetric traffic .",
    "shows the average packet throughput for the case in which half of the cells have opposite ul - to - dl ratios compared to the other half .",
    "for example , if the first half has a ratio of @xmath97 db , the second half has a ratio of @xmath98 db .",
    "this scenario is challenging in the sense that it is associated with high cross - link interference . in , we can see that the proposed scheme achieves considerable gains over both the random and fixed schemes . clearly , the proposed algorithm is able to find a balance between selecting the switching point that matches the scbs load and avoiding configurations that are associated with high cross - link interference .",
    "shows that the proposed approach achieves gains reaching up to @xmath99 and @xmath100 over the random and fixed schemes , respectively in the case of ul - to - dl ratio of @xmath94 db .    in",
    ", we show the average packet throughput resulting from all three schemes for different network sizes .",
    "this is done by varying the number of scbss while keeping the number of ues per scbs constant .",
    "all scbss are assumed to have an ul - to - dl ratio of @xmath97 db .",
    "shows that , as the number of scbss increases , the average packet throughput resulting from all three schemes decreases .",
    "this is due to the fact that higher scbss density increases the effect of interference from neighboring scbss .",
    "however , shows that , for all network sizes , the proposed approach yields a higher average packet throughput than the baseline schemes .",
    "this performance gain reaches up to @xmath101 and @xmath102 relative to fixed and random schemes , respectively .    in and ,",
    "the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme is evaluated for an example of two scbss operating in opposite ul - to - dl ratios of @xmath94 db and @xmath96 db .",
    "shows the variations in the probability distribution for the set of actions ( switching points ) as the algorithm iterates in the first scbs that is dominated by ul traffic , whereas the behavior of the second scbs that is dominated by dl traffic is shown in . from these figures",
    ", we can see that using the proposed algorithm , each scbs is able to capture the traffic conditions autonomously while adapting its switching point to match the estimated traffic load . switching point 5 which corresponds to the highest possible ul duty cycle , has the highest probability in the first cell , whereas in the second cell , switching point 1 is selected with the highest probability , which corresponds to the highest dl duty cycle .",
    "interestingly , scbss are able to implicitly coordinate their ul and dl transmissions , with no information exchange . from and",
    ", we can see that less than @xmath93 iterations are needed for the proposed algorithm to achieve convergence .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a dynamic uplink and downlink configuration scheme that takes into account both the ul and dl loads as well as the interference from neighboring small cells .",
    "the proposed algorithm is distributed and relies only on the local observations to perform the ul and dl adaptation .",
    "our results have shown that using the proposed algorithm , an scbs is able to learn and estimate its current load then use it to optimize its strategy of selecting the proper ul / dl switching point .",
    "simulation results have shown that the proposed approach significantly improves the network performance , in terms of the average packet throughput , compared to conventional fixed and random tdd deployments .",
