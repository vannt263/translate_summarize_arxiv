    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper and presents potential directions for further investigation .",
    "an autonomous or automated vehicle is a vehicle capable of fulfilling transport tasks such as motion and braking without the control of a human driver  @xcite .",
    "the development of autonomous vehicles relies on advances in computer vision , sensing technology , wireless communication , navigation , robotic control as well as technologies in automobile manufacturing  @xcite .",
    "significant progresses have been achieved in these fields over the past several decades .",
    "for example , lidar and vision - based detection techniques ( e.g. , stereo vision ) are extensively studied in pedestrian , lane and vehicle detection  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "vehicular communication systems make it possible for individual vehicles to share information ( e.g. , traffic congestion , road information ) from other vehicles in the vicinity , which can potentially improve the operational safety of autonomous vehicles  @xcite .",
    "the shift from conventional cars to autonomous vehicles can substantially reduce traffic accidents caused by human errors , given the fact that the operation of autonomous vehicles does not involve human intervention  @xcite .",
    "it also increases mobility for people who are unable or unwilling to drive themselves  @xcite .    as technology advances ,",
    "many prototypes of autonomous cars have been designed and developed .",
    "some examples of these include google driver - less car  @xcite , vislab s braive  @xcite , and bmw s m235i  @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "these cars are also successfully tested in various real - world traffic environments , making it possible and desirable to be integrated with mod systems .      to reduce private car ownership while also meeting the need for personal urban mobility , mitchell et al .",
    "introduces mod systems  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the original purpose of mod systems is to complement mass transportation systems such as subways and buses , providing commuters with the mobility for the first mile and the last mile .",
    "a notable prototype is the citycar  @xcite .",
    "the vehicles in current mod systems are mainly light electric vehicles across the main stations around the city , guided by human drivers or guideways , which limits the scope of mobility and the development of the mod systems .",
    "if autonomous vehicles were integrated into the mod systems , the amod systems would transform mobility and revolutionize the transportation industry by offering more flexible and more convenient solutions for urban personal mobility .",
    "due to lack of infrastructure , little research has been done on autonomous mod systems . among the very few studies ,",
    "spieser et.al .",
    "@xcite provides analytical guidelines for autonomous mod systems using singapore taxi data .",
    "the results show that amod systems could meet the mobility need of the same population with only 1/3 of the taxis that are current in operation .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite presents a similar analysis using a queueing - theoretical model with trip demand data in manhattan , new york city . while interesting and innovative , the research leaves a number of issues unexplored .",
    "for instance , how to efficiently manage autonomous vehicles to enhance passengers experience ?",
    "although numerous research addresses taxi dispatching problems using various methodologies including techniques in multi - agent systems  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , no or at least little research addresses methodologies on dispatching amod systems for better user experience . unlike conventional taxi dispatching systems where it is often difficult to coordinate because of human factors ( e.g. , the drivers may not follow the dispatcher s instructions carefully ) , the amod systems make it possible to implement a much higher level of autonomy through delicate , system - wide coordination .",
    "moreover , it is challenging to achieve near instantly availability using conventional approaches .",
    "we try to bridge this gap by introducing a new algorithm - the _ expand and target _ algorithm to effectively manage amod systems .",
    "in this section , we first discuss three scheduling strategies that are either commonly used in the taxi dispatching field or frequently studied in literature : the no - scheduling strategy ( nss ) , the static - scheduling strategy ( sss ) , and the online - scheduling strategy(oss )  @xcite .    for effective management of amod systems , we introduce the _ expand and target _ ( eat ) algorithm .",
    "this algorithm enables managing authorities of amod systems to automatically and effectively dispatch autonomous vehicles and meanwhile update adjacency schedule as well for better passenger experience : first , it increases the possibility of finding global optimal solutions ; second , it reduces computation time by avoiding looping all the possible vehicles ; third , it connects isolated areas with other dispatching areas and updates the adjacency schedule automatically , which increases the dispatch success rate .",
    "we then discuss methodologies on integrating the scheduling strategies with the eat algorithm to improve passengers experience , especially to reduce the average passenger waiting time and increase the trip success rate .        in this strategy ,",
    "the dispatcher assigns the nearest idle taxi to an incoming call .",
    "if such a taxi can not be found , then the call will be rejected .",
    "the dispatcher does not update the dispatching schedule .",
    "that is why we call it the no - scheduling strategy or nss .",
    "the nss is the most commonly used strategy in taxi dispatching applications  @xcite .      in sss",
    ", the dispatcher keeps a schedule of the dispatching process and updates it by appending an incoming call to the list of processed requests .",
    "when a new call comes , the dispatcher searches for the nearest taxi from all the vehicles ( both idle and busy ) .",
    "it then estimates the time from current position to the pickup location based on current traffic condition . for a idle taxi ,",
    "the dispatcher simply computes a trip plan directly from the taxi s current location to the pickup location . while for a taxi that is busy , the dispatcher then calculates the remaining time needed for the taxi to complete the current trip and then calculate a trip plan from the end point of the trip to the pickup location .",
    "then the dispatcher estimates the total time needed for this taxi to arrive at the pickup location . in this way",
    ", the dispatcher selects a taxi that can reach the passenger to be picked up in the quickest time .",
    "the dispatcher does update the schedule of the dispatching process , but it never reschedules or reassigns the requests .",
    "this strategy broadens the choice of taxis , but it scales poorly due to one - time scheduling .",
    "the oss is similar to the static approach except that in the online strategy the schedules are always re - computed in response to traffic variations such as delays or speedups .",
    "it is more cost efficient than sss but requires more computational power .",
    "we formally introduce the _ expand and target _ algorithm ( see algorithm [ etalgorithm ] ) .",
    "the basic idea of the algorithm is described as follows :    * when the dispatcher receives a call @xmath2 , it first identifies the neighborhood @xmath3 that @xmath4 originates from . *",
    "if area @xmath3 has no adjacent areas , it then searches for the nearest available vehicle in area @xmath3 :",
    "if found , it assigns the vehicle to the call , and returns the assignment ; if not , it searches for the nearest available vehicle in all dispatching areas : if found , it adds the vehicle s area @xmath5 as a neighbor of area @xmath3 ( by doing so , it removes the isolated dispatching area and updates the adjacency schedule ) , assigns the vehicle to the call , and returns the assignment ; if not found , it rejects the call .",
    "meanwhile , it updates the schedule . *",
    "if area @xmath3 has other adjacent areas @xmath6 where the service is available , then we define the dispatching area for call @xmath2 as @xmath7 . instead of searching for the nearest available vehicle in @xmath8",
    ", it first expands the dispatching area for @xmath2 : @xmath9 .",
    "we call this process as _",
    "expand_. the expansion is necessary because it diminishes the possibility of finding local minimum : for example , when a call is from the border of several areas , it is not sufficient to decide whether a nearest available vehicle is in the current dispatching area or from other areas without considering all the neighborhoods . * after expansion , then _ target _ : it searches for the nearest available vehicle in @xmath7 : if found , it assigns the vehicle to the call , returns the assignment and terminates ; if not found , then continues to expand the dispatching area @xmath7 using the previous strategy .",
    "@xmath10    @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14    @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    the _ expand and target _ algorithm dynamically expands the search space and targets the autonomous vehicles , in which the expansion and targeting can be viewed as a multi - agent , self - adaptive process .",
    "the algorithm assumes that the dispatching system processes passengers requests in a first - come , first - served ( fcfs ) manner .",
    "it is also suitable for dispatching systems using other policies such as batch processing .",
    "however , modification of the algorithm is necessary for such applications ( though we do not explore it in this work ) .      to improve the performance of the dispatching system ,",
    "we combine the three scheduling strategies discussed in section  [ scheduling ] and the eat algorithm , resulting in three integrated approaches : nss - eat , sss - eat , and oss - eat .",
    "the incorporation is straightforward : when applying the eat algorithm for dispatching autonomous vehicles , the dispatcher computes the nearest available vehicles using the three different scheduling strategies respectively .",
    "there is a commonly used searching method for taxi dispatching : when a call comes , the dispatcher first searches for a nearest available taxi in the current dispatching area ; if such a taxi not found , then searches for an available taxi in an adjacent area .",
    "if the taxi does not have adjacent areas , the dispatcher then rejects the call .",
    "we also integrate this method with the three scheduling strategies as three control groups : nss , sss , and oss .",
    "we implement the simulation platform for amod systems on top of the _ mobilitytestbed _",
    "mobilitytestbed _ is an agent - based , open - source simulation framework ( written in java ) tailored for modeling and simulating on - demand transport systems .",
    "it consists of three layers : the _ agentpolis _ simulator  @xcite , the testbed core and the mechanism implementation  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the first two layers provide the testbed api while the third layer enables users to implement their own mechanisms or strategies for various on - demand transport systems .",
    "the mechanism implementation includes three agent logic blocks : the driver agent logic , the dispatcher agent logic and the passenger agent logic . in amod systems ,",
    "no drivers are needed , so we replace the driver logic with the autonomous vehicle agent logic .",
    "mobilitytestbed _ does not work properly with large datasets ( e.g. , a trip demand file larger than 1 gb ) due to poor memory management schemes .",
    "thus , we modify the testbed core to make the platform be able to support large datasets .    this",
    "testbed also contains other components such as experiment management , benchmark importer , and visualization and reporting .",
    "however , the original experiment management component can only produce overall statistics , whereas in real - world scenarios it is important and necessary to log the operational data periodically for future use .",
    "the benchmark importer component provides benchmark data for studying on - demand transport systems , but it is customized for traditional on - demand transport service and only deal with small datasets . the visualization and reporting component , using google earth to visualize daily mobility pattern of passengers and vehicles ,",
    "does not work properly with large - scale datasets .",
    "for these reasons , we discard all the three components . to meet the needs of the experiment",
    ", we implement the data logger component which enables the platform to efficiently log the operational data periodically .",
    "an overview of the amod platform based on the _ mobilitytestbed _ is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : overviewamodsp ] .",
    "the simulation platform is composed of two layers- the mechanism implementation layer and the simulation platform core layer , and an extension - the data logger . the mechanism implementation includes three logic blocks : the vehicle agent logic , the dispatcher agent logic , and the passenger agent logic .",
    "the simulation platform core is built on the basis of the _ mobilitytestbed _ which consists of the testbed core and the _ agentpolis _ platform .",
    "[ fig : overviewamodsp ]",
    "to empirically evaluate the performance of the _ expand and target _ algorithm on managing amod systems , we implement six different dispatching approaches using the amod simulation platform on the basis of the _ mobilitytestbed _ and openstreetmap  @xcite .",
    "we then perform experiments using the 2013 new york city taxi data  @xcite and analyze the experimental results .      to evaluate the performance of the dispatching system from the passengers perspective , we select the following two metrics : the average passenger waiting time ( @xmath20 ) and the trip success rate ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is because they are considered as the two most important indicators of passenger satisfaction ( quality of service )  @xcite .",
    "the average passenger waiting time is formulated as the following equation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pickup time and the request time of call @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the set of calls and @xmath27 is the number of calls in set @xmath26 .",
    "the trip success rate is defined as below : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of successful trips and @xmath30 is the number of calls .",
    "we choose the 2013 new york city taxi data  @xcite to generate the trip demand .",
    "this raw data takes up for about 21.23 gb in csv format , in which each row represents a single taxi trip ( including demand information ) .",
    "table  [ table : datasample ] shows a small sample of data which we use in the experiments . in order to compute the average passenger waiting time",
    ", the request time of the calls is needed . however , there is no such information available in this dataset . to solve this problem",
    ", we use the actual pickup time as the request time .",
    "we compute the pickup time and dropoff time using the @xmath31 routing algorithm  @xcite . once a vehicle has finished a trip , it immediately become idle unless a new assignment comes . in the experiment ,",
    "a passenger is assigned with a patience value , which indicates the longest time that the passenger would like to wait for a car before he / she cancels the request .",
    "we randomly generate the patience value for each passenger from 60 seconds to 3600 seconds .",
    "due to failure or faults of data collection devices , the nyc taxi data contains a large number of errors such as impossible gps coordinates ( e.g. , ( 0,0 ) ) , times , or distances . to remove these errors",

    "we compare both the average passenger waiting time ( see table  [ table : apwt ] ) and the trip success rate ( see table  [ table : tsr ] ) of the amod systems using the six different dispatching approaches with the 2013 new york city taxi data ( from 01 - 01 - 2013 to 12 - 31 - 2013 ) .",
    "table  [ table : apwt ] and table  [ table : improve ] show that the eat algorithm significantly reduces the average waiting time , both monthly and yearly , with all the three scheduling strategies .",

    ", it saves 3,870,245.09 hours time for the passengers as well as substantial reduction on operational cost and green gas emission ( though we do not calculate it due to limited availability of the parameters ) . in the static - scheduling strategy scenarios ,",
    "the eat algorithm improves the system s performance by @xmath35 , bringing the overall average waiting time down from 7.80 @xmath34 to 6.17 @xmath34 . as for the systems with online - scheduling strategy , the yearly average waiting time is also diminished greatly by @xmath36 .",
    "though the eat algorithm considerably improves systems performance irrespective of the the scheduling strategies , it works best when associated with the nss scenario .",
    "this is because it is more prone to local minimum in the nss scenario than the others , while the eat algorithm counteracts the effect by systematically expanding the search space and updating the dispatching adjacency schedule .    from table  [ table :",
    "tsr ] and table  [ table : improve ] , we can see that the eat algorithms increases the trip success rate for systems with all the three scheduling strategies .",
    "the improvement for both nss and sss systems is slight , and below @xmath37 in most months of the year .",
    "however , the improvement for the oss system is significant , and can be up to @xmath38 monthly and @xmath1 for the whole year .",
    "the reason behind is that the combination of oss and eat provides the dispatcher sufficient search space of vehicles and updated information of the traffic information to target an optimal assignment .",
