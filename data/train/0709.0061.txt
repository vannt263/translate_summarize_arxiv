    "the burst lasted about 12 seconds and was strongest in the 1525 kev energy range and not seen above 50 kev @xcite .",
    "the bat spectrum could be fitted with a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath75 indicating a rather soft spectrum for a grb and suggesting that the source could be an accreting neutron - star x - ray binary which exhibited a type - i x - ray burst ( * ? ? ?",

    "the short duration of the burst is consistent with it being a type - i x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "just 83 seconds after the bat trigger , the _ swift _ xrt and uvot telescopes began taking data of the source .",
    "no uvot counterpart was seen but a decreasing faint x - ray source was detected @xcite which first slightly increased in x - ray flux until 200 seconds after the trigger when it then decreased in flux following a simple power - law decay with an index of approximately @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the xrt spectrum could be described by an absorbed power - law model with a photon index of 3.1 .",
    "@xcite stated that the spectral and temporal properties of the source are difficult to reconcile with standard grb afterglow models which would indicate that the source might indeed be a galactic accreting neutron star .",
    "this conclusion was further strengthened by the detection of a faint x - ray source at the xrt position in archival _ xmm - newton _ data taken nearly 6 years before the occurrence of the hard x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "the source was also officially retracted as a grb @xcite . to investigate the nature of this source",

    "the burst light curve between 15 and 40 kev is shown in figure  [ fig : batlc ] .",
    "the burst could not be conclusively detected above 40 kev indicating a very soft burst ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although the bat is not calibrated below 15 kev , we also show the 10 - 15 kev and the 10 - 40 kev light curves to demonstrate that the source had a rather high count rate at the lowest energies despite the fact that the sensitivity of the bat drops significantly at these energies .",
    "this again points to a very soft spectral shape of the burst .",
    "the burst lasted approximately 10 seconds and it looks similar at different energies , although the statistics are such that we can not rule out the same spectral variability which is normally observed for type - i x - ray bursts . the burst profile does not fully resemble the fast rise , exponential decay shape typically seen in type - i x - ray bursts . however , this does not rule out a type - i x - ray burst nature because our statistics are rather limited so stringent conclusion about the burst profile can not be made .",
    "in addition type - i x - ray bursts at energies above 15 kev can have more complex burst profiles ( see , e.g. , the type - i x - ray bursts seen from 4u 0614 + 09 seen by @xcite using bat and the hard x - ray bursts seen with integral as reported by @xcite ) .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of the whole burst and created the response matrix as outlined in the threads .",

    "we extracted the light curve for the source using a variable extraction region ( dependent on the brightness of the source to optimise the signal - to - noise ) and background subtracted the count rates .",
    "we adaptively binned the data so as to have 20 counts per bin ( grouping was done separately for the data segments of observation 00213190000 because of the rapid decrease in count rate ) .",
    "initially we found that the count rate slightly increased during the first @xmath7200 seconds , decreasing steadily after that ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , when we checked the source profile obtained and compared it with the expected profile using the point - spread - function of the xrt , we found that the source likely suffered from pile - up during the initial part of the light curve .",

    "the resulting light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : xrtlc ] .",
    "clearly , the initial rise has disappeared and the source decreases in flux from the start of the xrt observations until it reached a more constant level in the later observations .",
    "we fitted the resulting decay curve using different models and found that a simple power - law decay model with an index of @xmath19 fitted the decay curve best ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrtlc ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although formally still not acceptable ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is due to the third point and the last few points in the decay light curve which are significantly above the general decay trend .",
    "this indicates that the decay was not perfectly smooth and that possible small flares occurred on top of the power - law decay .    adding a constant level at the end of the decay",
    "did not significantly improve the fit significantly ( the resulting @xmath22 for 10 @xmath23 ) ; the index obtained was again @xmath24 .",
    "we also tried fitting an exponential decay function ( with and without a levelling off at the end ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) , but no such model could reproduce the data .",
    "the investigation of the x - ray spectrum of the source was complicated by 3 factors : the fact that the source was rapidly decaying ( which might possibly be accompanied by spectral changes ) , the pile - up during the first @xmath71000 seconds of the data , and the very faint fluxes in the late stages of the decay .",
    "we focused on the data of observation 00213190000 and divided it into three data sets : the first set contained the first @xmath7250 seconds of data of this observation , the second set contained the next @xmath7660 seconds of data ( starting about 550 seconds after the beginning of the observation ) , and the third set contained the remaining data ( @xmath716 ksec of exposure time spread out over 53 ksec ) .",
    "the first data set was most affected by pile - up so we extracted the spectrum using only grades 0 and using an annulus extraction region with inner radius of 8 pixels and outer radius of 30 pixels .",
    "the second data set suffered from less severe pile - up , so the annulus extraction region had an inner radius of 3 pixels ( and the same outer radius ; also only grades 0 were extracted ) .",
    "for the third set the pile - up was negligible and we used a circular extraction region with a radius of 20 pixels and grades 0 to 12 .",
    "we used the pre - made response matrices but we created our own ancillary response matrices which take into account the size and shape of the extraction region .",
    "for the background spectrum we used four source - free circular extraction regions , all with radii of 20 pixels , and combined the data from all four regions .",
    "after rebinning the spectra to have 10 counts per bin , we fitted them using xspec .",
    "the observations 00213190001 to 00213190006 could not be used to investigate the spectrum because , even though the source was detected when combining these observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) , the number of counts detected were not enough to obtain a useful spectrum .",
    "the three individual data sets from observation 00213190000 could be well fitted with a single component model ( e.g. , a disk black - body or power - law model ; reduced @xmath27 around 0.8 - 1.0 ) , but when fitting the first data set with an absorbed power - law model the resulting index was @xmath286 and a column density @xmath29 @xmath15 ( albeit with large errors ) .",
    "these values indicate that the spectrum most likely has a thermal shape instead of a non - thermal one ( although we note that a thermal model and a power - law model fit the data equally well ) .",
    "the other two data sets were consistent with a power - law model with indices between 2 and 3 . to obtain the best constraints on the fit parameters , we fitted the three data sets simultaneously and tied the column density @xmath30 between the observations .",
    "for the first data set we used a disk black - body model but for the other two a power - law model .",
    "this combination of models fitted the data reasonably well ( @xmath31 ) and the resulting fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : swift - results ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : xrtspectrum ] ) .",
    "we used a disk black body model in the first , brightest part of the observation and a power - law model for the fainter parts because such models are commonly used for x - ray transients at similar brightness levels .",
    "we note however , that the obtained parameters using these models are just an indication of the spectral shape of the source since many different types of models or combination of models fit the data equally well .",
    "the only tentative conclusion we can draw from these data is that the source seemed to switch from a thermal - like spectrum to a non - thermal spectrum during the first hundreds of seconds of the decay . because of",
    "the large uncertainties in the fit parameter and in determining which model should be used to fit the data , the errors on the absorbed fluxes are very large ( several tens of percent ) and even larger on the unabsorbed fluxes .",
    "the fluxes quoted in table  [ tab : swift - results ] are not corrected for absorption ; typically correction factors range between 1.3 and 1.6 . due to uncertainties of extrapolating the model outside the fitting range ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to quoting only the 210 kev fluxes .",
    "the position of grb060602b was in the field - of - view of three _ xmm - newton _ observations ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : xmm - log ] ) .",
    "one observation was before the burst detected from the source ( nearly six years before ; fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ; see also @xcite ) and the source is listed in the second _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalogue ( @xcite ; provided by the _ xmm - newton _ survey science centre ) as 2xmm j174931.6280805 . the other two were performed almost four months after the _ swift _ observations .",
    "we analysed these observations using sas .",
    "all instruments were active but here we only discuss the data as obtained with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instruments ( due to the very low flux of the source , it was not detected in the rgs instruments ) . for all data",
    "sets the mos cameras were operating in full window mode .",
    "in contrast , the pn camera was used in full window mode only for september 23 , 2000 ; for the other two dates it was in timing mode which is not well suited to study faint sources .",
    "therefore , we only used the pn data obtained during the first observation .",
    "we searched for background flares using light curves for photon energies above 10 kev . during the first observation , one bright flare was present and we removed it from the data ( this removed several hundreds of seconds of data ) . during the other two observations no background flares were present and all data could be used . for each observation , we combined the data of the epic cameras to obtain the highest signal - to - noise ratio for the determination of the source position . due to the high offset angle and the faintness of the source ,",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ positions have a relatively large error ( up to 4@xmath32 ) and the positions are not better than the one we obtained using _ swift _ when the source was in outburst .",
    "however , during all three observations , the position of the faint _ xmm - newton _ source is consistent with the _ swift_/xrt position of grb060602b .",
    "the count rates of the source were extracted using the funcnts program from the funtools package .",
    "the count rates were background subtracted and exposure corrected .",
    "as source extraction region we used a circle with a radius of 15@xmath6 and as background region a circle with a radius of 2@xmath5 in a region free of sources close to the position of grb060602b .",
    "the observed count rates are listed in table  [ tab : xmm - results ] .",
    "the low count rates observed for the source did not allow for a spectral analysis .",
    "we estimated the source flux using webpimms and assuming an absorbed power - law spectral shape with a column density of @xmath33 @xmath15 ( as measured for the _ swift_/xrt outburst data ; see tab .",
    "[ tab : swift - results ] ) and a power - law index of 2 .",
    "the resulting fluxes are also listed in table  [ tab : xmm - results ] .",
    "we also calculated the expected _",
    "swift_/xrt count rate for the last two observations ; the obtained 1.57 kev _ swift_/xrt count rates are @xmath34 count s@xmath14 which is a bit higher than observed at the end of the outburst with the xrt but is likely consistent when taking into account the many uncertainties and assumptions made . therefore , _ swift _ very likely observed the full decay outburst of this source , all the way down to quiescence .",
    "the all - sky - monitor ( asm ; @xcite ; which is aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ [ _ rxte _ ; ] ) light curve for grb060602b was determined over the duration of the _ rxte _ mission ( 1996 january to 2007 august ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are important in this case , since the source is only 1.2@xmath4 from the galactic centre , and 0.22@xmath4 from the x - ray transient igr j174972821 . in this region of the sky , an average of 24 x - ray sources must be included in the coded mask deconvolution for each 90 s exposure by one of the asm cameras . for grb060602b , the asm light curve shows no significant detections in either 90 s exposures or in weekly intervals . in particular , on 2006 june 2",
    "there are only 5 asm camera exposures with an average flux of 34@xmath3518 mcrab .",
    "the weekly exposures during 2006 may and june are near average levels , with upper limits in the range 20 - 35 mcrab ( 1.512 kev ) per week over this interval .",
    "we reported on the _ swift _ bat and xrt data of the x - ray burst source grb060602b .",
    "the bat spectrum could well be fitted with a black - body model with a temperature of @xmath72.9 kev and inferred radius of @xmath78 km , which is in the range of temperatures and radii seen from type - i x - ray bursts from neutron stars in lmxbs .",
    "this result , together with the detections of the source ( with a roughly constant luminosity ) in archival ( six years before the burst ) and more recently obtained ( four months after ) _ xmm - newton _ data strongly indicate that the source is indeed not a gamma - ray burst but an accreting neutron star ( as first suggested by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we rename the source swift j1749.42807 based on the revised bat discovery coordinates @xcite and we will use this name from now on .",
    "the nature of the donor star in this system is unclear .",
    "if the donor is a relatively high mass star ( @xmath36 ) , swift j1749.42807 might be a member of the group of recently identified supergiant fast x - ray transients ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these are systems harbouring likely a ob supergiant and they exhibit fast x - ray outbursts . however , despite that the typical outburst luminosities of these systems is around @xmath37 erg s@xmath14 , which is similar to what we see for swift j1749.42807 , the duration of the outbursts of the supergiant fast x - ray transients is generally much shorter ( only a few minutes to at most a few hours ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* although some outbursts lasted significantly longer but the majority have a very short duration ) and the outbursts are more erratic than what we have observed for swift j1749.42807 . moreover ,",
    "no high - mass x - ray binary has so far ever exhibited a type - i x - ray burst .",
    "although burst - like events have been observed from for example smc x-1 , such events have typical x - ray spectra which are not consistent with a black - body model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider it most likely that this system has a low - mass companion star ( with mass @xmath38 ) and that swift j1749.42807 is not a supergiant fast x - ray transient .",
    "if the bat burst was indeed a type - i x - ray burst , we can obtain a distance estimate towards the source .",
    "assuming that the eddington limit was reached during the burst and that the burst ignited in a hydrogen - poor environment , we can use the empirically determined eddington luminosity by to obtain a distance of @xmath39 kpc .",
    "if we instead use equation 6 of @xcite we obtain a distance of @xmath40 kpc for hydrogen - poor bursts and @xmath41 kpc for hydrogen - rich bursts ( assuming a neutron star with a mass of 1.4 @xmath42 and a radius of 10 km ) . we note that the fluxes we obtain are those averaged over the whole burst and therefore it is possible that the peak flux was even higher and thus the distance smaller . furthermore , if the burst we observed was not eddington limited , then the distance would also be smaller .",
    "although the bat burst spectrum strongly suggests that the source is a galactic accreting neutron star , the xrt data are atypical for what is observed for ordinary neutron - star x - ray transients .",
    "such systems are typically active ( when in outburst ) for weeks to months ( some even years to decades ) with a decay time scale ( i.e. , the e - folding time ) of at least a few days to weeks ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , within @xmath71 day , swift j1749.42807 decreased in flux by three orders of magnitude : from close to @xmath43 erg s@xmath14 @xmath15 ( the 210 kev flux during the first xrt data set ) to about @xmath44 erg s@xmath14 @xmath15 ( as measured during the last xrt data and the archival _ xmm - newton _ observations ) . assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc , the measured peak luminosity was close to @xmath45 erg s@xmath14 ( for the energy range 210 kev ) .",
    "however , if the x - ray flux began already to decay at a similar rate at the end of the type - i x - ray burst , then the source must have been accreting at about 10 times higher luminosity ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath14 ) when the burst occurred .",
    "the latter is a typical x - ray luminosity for the known active bursting sources in our galaxy .",
    "note that if the decay started at the end of the burst , then the source decreased by nearly four orders of magnitude in flux in one day !",
    "however , with the current data it can not be assessed whether or not the source had a similar decay rate in the time between the type - i x - ray burst and the start of the xrt observations .",
    "furthermore , it is also unclear if the occurrence of the burst in some way triggered the decay of the source or if the two are unrelated .",
    "the observed tentative change in spectral shape has been seen for many neutron - star x - ray transients .",
    "those systems typically change their spectral shape from thermally dominated to non - thermal dominated around a few times @xmath37 erg s@xmath14 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is close to the x - ray luminosity at which we observe the spectral shape of swift j1749.42807 to change .",
    "the exact duration of the outburst is also unclear .",
    "it is possible that the source was active for a considerable amount of time ( days to even weeks ) before the bat burst occurred .",
    "if true , the 210 kev flux of the source before the burst should not have been much above approximately @xmath47 erg s@xmath14 ( corresponding to a few times @xmath37 erg s@xmath14 ) otherwise we would have detected the source with the _ rxte_/asm .",
    "it is also possible that the rise and the peak were as fast as the decay observed in this source . for a type - i x - ray burst to occur",
    ", a certain amount of matter must be accreted",
    ". however , for ordinary neutron star lmxbs the bursts can recur within hours to a day when they have luminosities similar to those observed for our source when the burst occurred @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the source was active for only a day or so and still accumulated enough matter to exhibit the burst and then disappeared again .",
    "sources which exhibit such short outbursts are easily missed by monitoring instruments .",
    "this could then indicate that a significant number of similar systems may be present in our galaxy but which are usually missed when they are in outburst .",
    "their faint accretion luminosity and their short outbursts might make them very difficult to detect with monitoring instruments ; their bright type - i x - ray bursts might also easily be missed .",
    "interestingly , there is one class of neutron - star x - ray binaries which might be such a class of sources and which might be related to swift j1749.42807 : the so - called burst - only sources ( see * ? ? ? * for an overview of these sources ) .",
    "these systems are accreting neutron star sources which were discovered ( mostly with _",
    "bepposax _ but also with _ integral _ ) because a type - i x - ray burst was detected from them but which could not be detected outside the bursts with any of the monitoring instruments in orbit .",
    "the accretion luminosities of these sources at the time of the type - i x - ray bursts should be below @xmath7@xmath37 erg s@xmath14 for them to remain undetectable .",
    "more sensitive follow - up observations with for example _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ found that although some are persistent sources with very low luminosities , most of them were likely neutron - star transients which most of the time were in a very dim quiescent state ( with x - ray luminosities of the order of @xmath48 erg s@xmath14 or less ; see ) .",
    "in such systems , the type - i bursts were seen during one of their very - faint x - ray outbursts .",
    "one of these burst - only sources ( called sax j2224.9 + 5421 ; ) was of particular interest because within 8 hours after the wide field camera of _ bepposax _ discovered it through its burst , _ bepposax _ pointed at the source using the narrow field instrument ( nfi ) and could detect the source only at a 210 kev flux of @xmath49 erg s@xmath14 @xmath15 @xcite resulting in a luminosity of @xmath50 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "this detection of the source at a very faint level only 8 hours after the occurrence of the burst is very reminiscent of what we have observed for swift j1749.42807 .",
    "only @xmath78 hours after the burst , the xrt 210 kev flux of swift j1749.42807 had decreased already to around @xmath51 erg s@xmath14 @xmath15 , which is of the same order of magnitude as the flux observed for sax j2224.9 + 5421 outside its burst . suggested that sax j2224.9 + 5421 could be bursting at very low ( near quiescent ) x - ray luminosities , but our results on swift j1749.42807 also suggest that both sources could be very similar sources which exhibit a relatively faint ( but not very faint ) outburst but they decay very rapidly after the occurrence of their type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "determining the exact accretion luminosity at which the bursts occur is important in understanding the burst physics since the burst properties depend strongly on the accretion rate at the time the burst occurs .",
    "although the accretion situation is evident for swift j1749.42807 , it remains unclear for sax j2224.9 + 5421 .",
    "clearly , for these systems and others similar to them , the very short slew time available with _ swift _ is necessary to distinguish between the different scenarios .",
    "swift j1749.42807 decayed rapidly to a constant level which was very similar to what _ xmm - newton _ saw from the source six years before the occurrence of the burst and four months after it .",
    "therefore , this constant flux level very likely represents the quiescent flux of the source which , for a distance of 6.7 kpc , results in a 210 kev luminosity of 0.51.0 @xmath52 erg s@xmath14 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is very similar to the quiescent luminosity seen for other neutron - star x - ray transients in their quiescent state .",
    "sadly , due to the faintness of the source no spectral information could be obtained but the high @xmath30 ( as measured in outburst with the xrt ) in - front of the source makes it difficult to detect any soft , thermal component and it is very likely that the emission we observe is ( mostly ) due to a non - thermal component . with the current data no sensible upper limits can be obtained on any thermal component with which we could test cooling models for accretion - heated neutron stars . a longer exposure observation with _ xmm - newton _ ( with the source on - axis ) or a deep _ chandra _ observation ( with its much lower background ) is needed to study the quiescent emission of this source with the detail necessary to allow comparative studies with other quiescent neutron - star x - ray transients .",

    "<S> the x - ray binary nature is further confirmed by the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the xrt counterpart of the burst in archival _ xmm - newton _ data approximately 6 years before the burst and in more recent _ xmm - newton _ data obtained at the end of september 2006 ( nearly 4 months after the burst ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the source is very likely not a gamma - ray burst , we rename the source swift j1749.42807 , based on the _ swift_/bat discovery coordinates . using the bat data of the type - i x - ray burst we determined that the source is at most at a distance of @xmath0 kpc . for a transiently accreting x - ray binary </S>",
    "<S> its soft x - ray behaviour is atypical : its 210 kev x - ray luminosity ( as measured using the _ swift_/xrt data ) decreased by nearly 3 orders of magnitude in about 1 day , much faster than what is usually seen for x - ray transients . </S>",
    "<S> if the earlier phases of the outburst also evolved this rapidly , then many similar systems might remain undiscovered because the x - rays are difficult to detect and the type - i x - ray bursts might be missed by all sky surveying instruments . </S>",
    "<S> this source might be part of a class of very - fast transient low - mass x - ray binary systems of which there may be a significant population in our galaxy .    </S>",
