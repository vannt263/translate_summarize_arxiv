    "one of the central questions of statistical mechanics is the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of a given fluid starting from the forces between the molecules . a major contribution in this direction is the work of mayer and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "this was further developed by born and fuchs @xcite , and uhlenbeck and kahn @xcite .",
    "all of these papers concern the theory of non - ideal gases for which the pressure is written as a power series in the activity or density .",
    "the convergence of such power series was investigated much later , during the 1960 s , by groeneveld , lebowitz , penrose and ruelle .",
    "parallel to the study of monoatomic gases , multi - component systems were also investigated , for example in @xcite for the case of a two - component system and later in @xcite for a mixture with an arbitrary ( but finite ) number of different components .",
    "although briefly mentioned already in @xcite , the complete study of the convergence of the activity expansion comes later in @xcite for mixtures of finitely many components .",
    "the generalisation of virial expansions and approximate equations of state from the monoatomic gas to mixtures is not straightforward .",
    "the van der waals equation for binary mixtures of hard spheres , for example , comes in different versions , distinguished by different `` mixing rules '' for obtaining effective parameters of the mixture  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for the percus - yevick and virial equations of state .",
    "going from binary mixtures to multi - component systems is not easy either  in fuchs words , `` for the most intricate parts of the calculation even the theory of the two - component system does not give any indication as to the results for the many - component system ( e.g. the reduction of the cluster integrals to the irreducible cluster integrals ) ''  @xcite .",
    "even less trivial is the extension from finitely to infinitely many types of particles , in particular for estimating the domain of convergence .    the present work deals with the virial expansion for countably many types of particles , addressing in particular the problem of convergence .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "first , mixtures as studied in physical chemistry are of interest on their own .",
    "second , multi - component systems arise as effective models as in  the consideration of certain phenomena connected with the order - disorder transition in alloys \" @xcite , or in the treatment of a monoatomic gas as a mixture of `` droplets '' ( groups of particles close in space ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5.27 ) .",
    "a droplet can comprise arbitrarily many particles , and there can be arbitrarily many droplet sizes  this is why we are interested in mixtures with infinitely many species .    in the first part of this article",
    ", we are given a pressure function that depends on countably many fugacity parameters .",
    "this yields countably many densities ( that are also functions of fugacities ) and the goal is to write the pressure as function of densities . in the case of one parameter , this can be done using lagrange inversion  @xcite .",
    "we note that this analytical method is also a standard tool in combinatorics  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) . in the case of multicomponent systems ,",
    "the key ingredient is good s generalisation of the lagrange inversion to several variables  @xcite .",
    "the lagrange - good inversion has attracted attention in a variety of contexts  @xcite .",
    "faris has recently noticed its relevance for the virial expansion @xcite .",
    "our main focus is on the convergence of the expansion . despite recent renewed interest on the single - species virial expansion  @xcite",
    ", this question does not seem to have been addressed before in the case of infinitely many species .",
    "our main result is the existence of a non - trivial domain of convergence for the expansion of the pressure as function of densities .",
    "a novel feature is to use lagrange - good for proving convergence .",
    "the second part of this article deals with a gas of classical particles with two - body interactions .",
    "there are many species of particles . under some assumptions ,",
    "the virial coefficients are given in terms of two - connected graphs ( irreducible cluster integrals ) .",
    "early derivations for systems with one , two , or finitely many components can be found in  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the work of mayer , a systematic connection with combinatorics has been initiated , linking the enumeration of connected and two - connected graphs with cluster and virial expansions .",
    "this connection has been further developed in the work of leroux and collaborators @xcite , leading to modern proofs for the expression of virial coefficients .",
    "this was generalised by faris to the case of many species @xcite .",
    "the present article has some overlap , but there are several differences . in particular , we formulate sufficient conditions on the interactions that guarantee the convergence of the virial expansion .",
    "we would like to emphasise that our results have relevance beyond statistical mechanics .",
    "indeed , our main result can be formulated as an inverse function theorem for functions between banach spaces that are not necessarily frchet - differentiable ( section  [ sec : inverse - function ] ) .",
    "in addition , our result can be applied in the original context of the lagrange - good inversion formula : good motivated his work by stochastic branching processes and combinatorics of coloured trees @xcite .",
    "recursive properties of trees lead to functional equations between generating functions . when combined with the inversion formula they yield expressions of probabilities or tree cardinalities as contour integrals ; good explicitly computed some of those integrals . our result yields bounds for cardinalities without having to compute the integrals , which may come in handy when explicit computations prove too complicated .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section [ sec virial ]",
    "we give the general setting of the virial expansion in the context of formal power series .",
    "the main theorem proposes sufficient conditions under which the virial power series is absolutely convergent .",
    "this is done by deriving explicit bounds on the virial coefficients via the lagrange - good inversion formula . in section [ sec graphs ]",
    "we prove a dissymmetry theorem for coloured weighted graphs and deduce that the virial coefficients are given by the two - connected graphs ; this result holds whenever the weights satisfy a block factorisation property .",
    "finally , in section [ sec clexp ] , we consider a mixture of rigid molecules and , using the results on the convergence of the cluster expansion given in @xcite , we show that the mixture meets the conditions of section  [ sec virial ] .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a sequence of complex numbers . consider the formal series [ p(z ) ] p(z ) = _",
    "n b(n ) z^n , where the sum is over all multi - indices @xmath1 , @xmath2 , with finitely - many non - zero entries and @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that for all @xmath4 , the coefficient @xmath5 of @xmath6 in @xmath7 is non - zero ; this is the only condition needed for lagrange inversion techniques . in sections  [ sec graphs ] and  [ sec clexp ] we will need the additional assumption that the coefficients are normalized as @xmath8 , as is the case in most applications in statistical mechanics .",
    "we use the notation @xmath9 . in statistical physics",
    ", @xmath10 represents the `` activity '' ( or `` fugacity '' ) of the species @xmath11 , and @xmath7 is the pressure of the system with many species .",
    "a physically relevant quantity is the density @xmath12 of the species @xmath11 , whose definition is [ def densities ] _ i(z ) = z_i ( z ) .",
    "we do not suppose yet that the series for @xmath7 is convergent , and the equation above should be understood in the sense of formal series . to be precise , @xmath13 is the formal series with coefficients @xmath14 .    in statistical physics , the _ virial expansion _ is the expansion of the pressure in powers of the density .",
    "accordingly , we define the coefficients @xmath15 by the equation [ def virial ] p(z ) = _",
    "n c(n ) ( z)^n . here also , we use the notation @xmath16 .",
    "let us check that the coefficients @xmath15 are well - defined in the sense of formal series .",
    "observe that @xmath17 { { \\boldsymbol\\rho}}({{\\boldsymbol z}})^{{{\\boldsymbol n } } } \\neq 0 $ ] only if @xmath18 , i.e. , if @xmath19 for all @xmath11 ; the notation @xmath20 { { \\boldsymbol\\rho}}({{\\boldsymbol z}})^{{\\boldsymbol n}}$ ] refers to the coefficient of @xmath21 in the formal power series @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 is a `` summable family '' of formal series in the sense of def .",
    "2.2 in @xcite , and the coefficients of @xmath24 in ( [ def virial ] ) satisfy [ finite sum ] b(k ) = [ z^k ] _ n",

    "our goal is to control the convergence of the virial expansion , assuming convergence of the series @xmath7 . in the following",
