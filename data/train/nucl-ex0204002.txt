    "the modification of hadron properties in nuclear matter is a major topic in nuclear studies . of special importance",
    "is chiral restoration because it is a significant milestone on the long path which goes from quark confinement in nuclei at ordinary density and temperature to the high density and temperature of the quark  gluon plasma .",
    "major changes are expected to occur for the @xmath9 , or `` @xmath8 '' state , when it is produced on a nucleus even for low atomic number @xmath10 , rather than on a nucleon .",
    "the @xmath8 is the symbol for the correlated @xmath11 system in the @xmath12 state .",
    "it plays an important role in the intermediate range @xmath13 interaction  @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath8 make it the chiral partner of the pion . under chiral restoration",
    ", the @xmath8 and @xmath14 should have degenerate masses , which implies that the @xmath8 should have a large reduction in mass when approaching chiral restoration .",
    "the interest in @xmath8 medium modifications was fanned in a major way by a 1996 chaos publication  @xcite in which they reported on a measurement of the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath15 system ( @xmath16 ) that was produced by @xmath17 interactions in complex nuclei .",
    "the @xmath16 spectrum near @xmath18 was reported as `` close to zero for @xmath19 , and increases dramatically with increasing @xmath10 '' .",
    "a marked @xmath10dependent peak at about @xmath18 was interpreted by the chaos collaboration as follows : `` the experimental results indicate that nuclear matter strongly modifies the @xmath20 interaction in the @xmath12 channel '' .",
    "the complete @xmath16 spectra for complex nuclei reported by chaos were stunningly similar to theoretical predictions of medium modifications made by schuck _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and chanfray _",
    "et al . _",
    "it started a cascade of papers on @xmath8 medium modifications  @xcite and played a prominent role in two recent workshops  @xcite .",
    "there were no new experimental data until the crystal ball collaboration made a careful search for a peak near @xmath21 in the more favorable @xmath3 spectra produced by @xmath1 interactions .",
    "the four photons in the @xmath3 final state were detected with the crystal ball detector , which has a near @xmath22 acceptance and detects @xmath2 s down to zero kinetic energy .",
    "there was no indication of the chaos peak  @xcite . in the meantime , bonutti _ et al .",
    "_ hinted that the chaos peak was at least in part an artifact caused by the limited acceptance of the chaos detector  @xcite .",
    "the chaos collaboration has shifted its interest to a change in the shape of the @xmath16 spectra obtained on complex targets  @xcite .",
    "they proclaim new , different evidence for nuclear medium modifications from the shape of the ratio of @xmath16 for different targets .",
    "however , the difference in the slope of the @xmath16 spectra for different @xmath10 can be due to two very different mechanisms .",
    "one is the difference in interaction of the outgoing particles inside the nucleus .",
    "the other one is a generic change in the shape to lower @xmath23 because of @xmath8 medium modifications .",
    "we present new data on @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 production by @xmath1 of 750  mev/@xmath0 that may help in investigating these two possibilities .",
    "specifically , the following reactions have been studied : @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( via the @xmath26 decay mode ) , and @xmath27 , where @xmath10 is h , c , al , or cu .",
    "we will show experimental similarities and differences that have been found for the reactions above",
    ". our principal focus will be on the reaction @xmath28 .",
    "photons from @xmath2 and @xmath4 decays were detected with the crystal ball ( cb ) multiphoton spectrometer ( see fig .  [ cball ] ) .",
    "it is constructed of 672 optically isolated nai(tl ) crystals that cover 93% of @xmath29 sterad .",
    "electromagnetic showers in the spectrometer are measured with an energy resolution @xmath30 ; the angular resolution for photon showers at energies 50500  mev is @xmath31@xmath32 in the polar angle and @xmath33 in the azimuthal angle .",
    "here @xmath34 is the standard deviation for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the neutral final states were distinguished from charged ones by a veto barrel made of four plastic scintillation counters that covered the active volume of the cb .",
    "most of our results presented here were obtained for the neutral final states .",
    "the charged final states were used to calculate the experimental corrections due to photon conversion and nuclei breakup .",
    "the experiment was performed in the c6 beam line of the brookhaven national laboratory ags .",
    "the centroid of the beam momentum is known to better than 1% .",
    "we used three solid targets : c ( 3.44  g/@xmath35 ) , al ( 1.69  g/@xmath35 ) , and cu ( 1.51  g/@xmath35 ) .",
    "a 10  cm  long liquid hydrogen target ( lh@xmath36 ) was used for the hydrogen data presented here .",
    "the reaction @xmath24 was identified from events with four clusters .",
    "two - cluster events were used to select the reactions @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details on the experimental apparatus , data analysis , and the monte carlo simulation for acceptance calculations . in order to facilitate comparisons for different targets",
    ", we calculated an `` effective missing mass '' for each nuclear target , given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of the target nucleus , @xmath39 is the mass of the residual nucleus , and @xmath40 is the atomic number of the target nucleus .",
    "missing mass spectra for hydrogen as well as the effective missing mass spectra for nuclear targets were calculated for all three reactions assuming `` quasifree '' production .",
    "the missing mass distributions of @xmath3 events obtained with the lh@xmath36 target as well as the spectra of the effective missing mass for different nuclear targets are presented in fig .",
    "a sharp neutron peak with width @xmath42  mev is seen in case of the hydrogen target . for the solid targets this peak broadens substantially .",
    "some of the broadening is explained by the fermi momentum of the target nucleons .",
    "our monte carlo calculations indicate that the broadening is mainly due to nuclear effects such as @xmath2 rescattering inside the nucleus .",
    "our calculations of the pion rescattering and absorption used the model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to select @xmath43 events with minimum rescattering distortions",
    ", we applied the effective - missing - mass cuts indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by the two vertical dashed lines .",
    "the resulting @xmath43 invariant mass distributions , both with and without the missing mass cut , are given in fig .",
    "all spectra are compatible with a smooth distribution ; _ i.e. _ , there is no sharp peak . the broad maximum at @xmath44",
    "mev obtained for the hydrogen target disappears for carbon and other nuclear targets .",
    "our invariant - mass distributions for c , al , and cu targets obtained without the cuts on the effective missing mass show broad maxima for @xmath3 masses below 400  mev .",
    "the distributions obtained for c and al become almost flat between 300  mev and 480  mev after the application of the effective - missing - mass cuts .",
    "the kinetic - energy spectra of the @xmath45 system are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for our targets .",
    "the spectra differ markedly for various targets . the angular distributions for the @xmath3 system in the laboratory for different targets",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the shapes of the angular distributions have similar features such as the broad maximum at about @xmath46 for all targets including hydrogen .",
    "the minor increase in the broadness of the maxima as a function of @xmath10 can be explained by the fermi momentum of the target protons . neither the distribution of the kinetic energy nor the angular distributions were corrected for the crystal ball acceptance .",
    "the acceptance is a rather flat and smooth function of the kinetic energy and the lab angle .    to probe the net effect of the nuclear medium",
    ", we have investigated the cross sections as a function of @xmath10 . to trace the disappearance of the high mass peak near 500  mev in the invariant mass spectra",
    ", we have divided all distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as indicated into a low  mass region ( between 270  mev and 445  mev ) and a high  mass region ( above 445  mev ) .",
    "the angular @xmath47 distributions were used to calculate integrated cross sections , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for both mass regions as well as the total integrated cross section @xmath50 . assuming that the nuclear dependence of the cross section is proportional to the geometrical factor @xmath51 , where @xmath52 we normalized our cross sections to @xmath51 and to the hydrogen cross section , @xmath50(h ) , combining them into the ratio @xmath53 : @xmath54    the results for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath55 for c , al , and cu are shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath48 remains rather constant and close to the expectation based on eq .",
    "[ s_int ] , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] by a straight line .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath49 cross section falls off very rapidly from hydrogen to carbon ; _",
    "i.e. _ , the maximum at about 510  mev seen in the @xmath41 invariant mass spectra ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) is absorbed rather than shifted toward lower masses . for higher @xmath10 s the @xmath49 remains nearly constant . in summary , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that mainly high ",
    "mass @xmath3 events are absorbed by nuclear medium effects , whereas low mass events are less effected . in the case of @xmath57 production ,",
    "the events may be absorbed via the @xmath58 mechanism .",
    "though @xmath59 and @xmath4 mesons are similar in some aspects _ e.g. _ , they both are pseudoscalar mesons with @xmath60 , they also have relevant differences in isospin and in quark composition .",
    "it is therefore very attractive to compare the behavior of @xmath59 and @xmath4 mesons in nuclear matter .",
    "the theoretical interest has been discussed by y.  s.  golubeva _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "all @xmath4 results in this section are preliminary .",
    "the data were obtained from the @xmath61 decay mode .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath62 invariant mass spectra for the h and cu targets .",
    "the first peak in the spectrum is due to @xmath2 ( width @xmath63  mev ) , and the second peak is due to @xmath4 ( @xmath64  mev ) .",
    "the background under the @xmath2 and @xmath4 peaks is associated mainly with photon / neutron misidentification . in the case of copper ,",
    "some additional background arises from products of nuclei breakup and recoil interactions .    the missing - mass and the effective - missing - mass distributions for @xmath4 production are shown in fig .",
    "a nearly background - free neutron peak can be seen for hydrogen .",
    "the widening of the peaks towards lower values of the effective missing mass for carbon and other nuclear targets is less dramatic than for the @xmath65 case .",
    "it can be explained mainly by the nucleon fermi momentum .",
    "it indicates that @xmath4 s are less affected by rescattering than pions .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in the @xmath4 angular distribution in the laboratory system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4 angular distribution in the lab for hydrogen at this momentum is limited to about @xmath66 by kinematics .",
    "it peaks at about @xmath67 due to the jacobian . for the solid targets , the angular distributions",
    "slightly exceed the two  body kinematical limit because of the fermi momentum . at 750  mev/@xmath0 ,",
    "the cb acceptance for this reaction is smooth and uniform .    by integrating the angular distributions , we obtained integrated cross sections @xmath50 for the h , c , al , and cu targets .",
    "@xmath50 was normalized to @xmath51 and to the hydrogen data .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] indicate that the @xmath4 cross section falls from h to c , and it is lower than the expectation based on the geometrical factor ( see eq .  [ s_int ] ) .",
    "it confirms the large @xmath68 absorption cross section observed in earlier @xmath4 photoproduction experiments  @xcite . from a comparison of the ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , one may conclude that the behavior of @xmath69 is remarkably similar to that obtained for the @xmath70 ratio .",
    "we summarize the results of this section as follows :    1 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath4 missing mass is little influenced by nuclear media ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "a strong @xmath4 absorption in nuclear targets was observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "single @xmath2 production is the predominant reaction among the three we have studied . in the case of hydrogen , the charge - exchange reaction ( cex ) is well understood in terms of conventional @xmath71 phase - shift analyses . for nuclear targets , however , cex is accompanied by strong secondary reactions that lead to a large fraction of single @xmath2 produced in reactions other than direct cex .",
    "one of the contributing reactions is @xmath72 production via @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath72 can be rescattered or absorbed on other nucleons , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath58 , and the reaction ends with a single @xmath2 . in that case",
    ", the missing mass would be equal to the mass of the @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the single-@xmath2 missing mass and the effective - missing - mass spectra for neutral two - cluster events .",
    "compared to hydrogen , a substantial broadening of the `` quasi - elastic '' peak can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for all nuclear targets .",
    "this broadening reflects a large probability for the @xmath2 to rescatter inside the nuclei .",
    "in contrast to the hydrogen data , the c , al , and cu effective - missing - mass data show a second maximum at masses of about 1200  mev . such maxima can be partially attributed to @xmath57 production followed by @xmath72 absorption in nuclei .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the conclusions of sec .",
    "[ sec2pi0 ] regarding the absorption of @xmath3 events in nuclei .    for some applications it may be desirable to separate partly the secondary processes from the `` quasi - elastic '' cex events by applying the cuts on the effective missing mass . the influence of those to - some - extent arbitrary cuts in the angular distribution and the pions kinetic energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the distributions are not corrected for the crystal ball acceptance .",
    "the cb acceptance is smooth and an uniform function between 30@xmath74 and 150@xmath74 .",
    "the acceptance for @xmath2 drops very rapidly below 30@xmath74 and above 150@xmath74 , due to the entrance and exit tunnels . in the angular distribution obtained for hydrogen ,",
    "a clear backward peak is seen .",
    "the peak disappears for the other targets .",
    "a similar behavior for single @xmath2 production on carbon was found by r.  j.  peterson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . for a two  body kinematic process",
    ", the backward peak in the @xmath2 angular distribution corresponds to pions with kinetic energy of about 200  mev .",
    "the peak is clearly seen in the single-@xmath2 kinetic - energy distribution for hydrogen ( see fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the peak disappears for carbon and other nuclear targets , which indicates a large probability for the absorption of @xmath2 s with kinetic energy of about 200  mev .",
    "a possible mechanism for such absorption is the formation of a @xmath75 inside nuclei in @xmath76 interactions followed by @xmath75 absorption .",
    "the diphoton decay @xmath78 in hadronic matter has been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite from optimized perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath79 decay is interesting because the photons are not affected by final - state interactions . despite the low branching ratio",
    ", it might be possible to see the decay experimentally if there is a prominent @xmath8 enhancement at low invariant mass in the nuclear medium .",
    "the main background is the thermal annihilation of two pions , @xmath80 .",
    "we obtained the upper limit for br@xmath77 in carbon by comparing the @xmath81 invariant - mass spectra of the hydrogen and carbon targets .",
    "some additional cuts were applied to the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to reduce the low invariant mass background .",
    "the final spectra obtained for the hydrogen and carbon targets are shown in fig .",
    "[ f02 g ] .",
    "the hydrogen spectrum is normalized to carbon in the area next to the @xmath2 peak ( at around 180  mev ) .",
    "the difference taken between those spectra is compared to our monte carlo results in fig .",
