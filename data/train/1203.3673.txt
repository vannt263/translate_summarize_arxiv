    "in a recent work @xcite three excited states in the @xmath1 nucleus @xmath3pd , lying quite far from the stability line , were observed .",
    "this is a remarkable achievement since the @xmath1 nuclei play a special role in understanding the nuclear effective interaction , in particular the interplay and competition between the isovector and isoscalar components .",
    "in fact , in this case neutrons and protons occupy the same orbitals , which gives rise to a large overlap of their wave functions . in this context , the main question , which is still a matter of debate @xcite , is the existence of strongly correlated @xmath5 @xmath6 pairs , similarly to the well - known case of neutron and proton pairs coupled to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that the main feature of the measured levels of @xmath3pd is their approximate equidistance .",
    "an interpretation was given of this feature in terms of a shell - model calculation with an empirical hamiltonian .",
    "this reproduces very well the experimental levels and yields wave functions built manly from @xmath9 @xmath6 pairs , which has been seen as evidence for a spin - aligned @xmath6 paired phase .",
    "the results of @xcite have immediately attracted much attention and the role of the isoscalar @xmath6 pairs in the low - energy structure of the @xmath1 nuclei close to doubly magic @xmath0sn has been investigated in some very recent theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "these studies confirm substantially the dominance of @xmath9 , @xmath5 pairs in the low - lying yrast states of the @xmath1 nuclei with four , six and eight holes below @xmath0sn .",
    "the relevance of the isoscalar component of the @xmath6 interaction has been stressed in a subsequent work  @xcite , where the @xmath10 `` spin - gap '' isomer in @xmath2cd has been identified and its origin explained as due to the strong influence of this component .",
    "another interesting outcome of the above works is that in all nuclei above @xmath11ru the low - lying yrast states can be essentially described in terms of the single @xmath4 shell .",
    "this situation is of course reminiscent of the so - called @xmath12 nuclei that have been the subject of a large number of theoretical studies ever since the seminal paper by mccullen , bayman and zamick @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore appropriate to call these special nuclei below @xmath0sn",
    "`` @xmath13 nuclei '' .",
    "some ten years ago , we performed @xcite shell - model calculations for @xmath14 nuclei immediately below @xmath0sn employing a realistic effective interaction derived from the bonn - a nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) potential by means of a @xmath16-matrix formalism . in that work we took as model space for the valence proton holes the four levels @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath13 of the 28 - 50 shell .",
    "our results turned out to be in very good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "since then , however , a new paradigm for realistic shell - model calculations has been developed which consists in renormalizing the strong short - range repulsion of the bare @xmath15 potential through the so - called @xmath20 approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high - precision potentials have been constructed which fit the @xmath21 and @xmath6 scattering data with a @xmath22 .",
    "the exciting new findings mentioned before have stimulated us to perform modern realistic shell - model calculations for nuclei below @xmath0sn , with particular attention focused on @xmath3pd and on the heavier @xmath1 nucleus @xmath2cd , for which theoretical predictions are likely to be verified in the not too distant future .",
    "based on the dominant role of the @xmath13 orbit in the low - lying states of the nuclei considered in the present study , we have restricted our calculations to the single @xmath13 shell .",
    "this permits a more transparent analysis of the structure of the wave functions , especially for @xmath2cd , in terms of either the @xmath23 \\otimes [ pp]$ ] or @xmath24 \\otimes [ np]$ ] coupling schemes .",
    "the comparison between these two approaches is instrumental to understand the role of the @xmath9 @xmath6 pairs .",
    "it may also be worth recalling that within the @xmath25 space the choice of the single - hole energies is not an easy task @xcite , since there is no spectroscopic information on the single - hole nuclei @xmath26 in and @xmath26sn .    in sec .",
    "ii we focus attention on the @xmath13 effective interaction employed in our calculations",
    ". results for @xmath2cd and @xmath3pd are presented in sec .",
    "iii , where we also give a detailed analysis of the structure of wave functions .",
    "iv provides a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "we assume @xmath0sn as a closed core and let the neutron and proton holes move in the single @xmath13 orbit .",
    "our two - body effective interaction is derived within the framework of the time - dependent degenerate linked - diagram perturbation theory @xcite starting from the high - precision cd - bonn @xmath15 potential @xcite .",
    "this potential , that as all modern @xmath15 potentials contains high - momentum nonperturbative modes , is renormalized by constructing a low - momentum potential @xmath20 .",
    "this is achieved by integrating out the high momentum modes of the bare potential down to a cutoff momentum @xmath27 = 2.1 @xmath28 .",
    "then the smooth @xmath20 potential plus the coulomb force for protons is used to calculate the two - body matrix elements of the effective interaction by means of the @xmath29-box folded - diagram expansion @xcite , with the @xmath29-box including all diagrams up to third order in @xmath20 .",
    "these diagrams are computed using the harmonic oscillator basis and considering intermediate states composed of all possible hole states and particle states restricted to the six proton and neutron shells above the fermi surface .",
    "the oscillator parameter @xmath30 is 8.55 mev , as obtained from the expression @xmath30 = 45@xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the shell - model calculations have been performed by the nushellx code  @xcite .",
    ".proton - proton , neutron - neutron , and proton - neutron matrix elements of @xmath33 in the @xmath13 orbit ( in mev ) . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ spac ]    the contributions to the five spacings arising from the different pairs are reported in table  [ spac ] , where we only include values larger than 130 kev .",
    "the two last columns allows to compare the calculated spacings of fig .",
    "[ 92pd]a with those obtained by summing the contributions reported in the table .",
    "we see that they do not differ significantly . from table",
    "[ spac ] it appears that the most important contributions to the energy spacings arise from the @xmath7 pairs , although those from @xmath34 and 9 can not be ignored at all , being particularly relevant for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 spacings . in this regard",
    ", it should be kept in mind that the structure of the wave functions , and consequently the specific action of the interaction in the @xmath7 and 2 channels , is strongly influenced by the size of the @xmath9 matrix element .    in concluding this discussion",
    ", we should mention that the content of isoscalar spin - aligned pairs in the wave functions of @xmath3pd is still significant even when @xmath37 is suppressed .",
    "this , as already emphasized for @xmath2cd , is related to geometrical features .",
    "in this work , we have performed a shell - model study of @xmath1 nuclei below @xmath0sn that can be described in terms of the single @xmath13 orbit .",
    "the effective interaction for this orbit has been derived from the cd - bonn @xmath15 potential without using any adjustable parameter .",
    "this approach reproduces very well the excited states of @xmath3pd observed in a recent experiment , and therefore provides confidence in our predictions for @xmath2cd and @xmath38 in .    aside from the intrinsic interest in employing a realistic effective interaction to describe these neutron - deficient nuclei ,",
    "the present work was motivated by the suggestive interpretation given in ref .",
    "@xcite of the almost equidistant levels in the @xmath3pd spectrum .",
    "it was argued , in fact , that this feature may be traced to an isoscalar spin - aligned @xmath6 coupling scheme replacing the normal isovector @xmath7 pairing which is dominant for like valence particle nuclei .",
    "we have thus decided to investigate the role played by the @xmath6 interaction in the @xmath9 , @xmath5 channel .    as regards @xmath2cd ,",
    "we have found that the matrix element @xmath37 has a direct influence on energies of the high - spin states @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath10 , making the latter isomeric , while for the states with @xmath41 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 it also substantially affects the structure of the wave functions .",
    "more precisely , a more attractive matrix element leads to a larger content of @xmath9 pairs and , for states up to @xmath44 , to a larger fragmentation in terms of the @xmath23 \\otimes[pp]$ ] basis .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the large content of @xmath9 pairs for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 arises also from the significant overlap of the @xmath48_i$ ] component with @xmath49_i$ ] and @xmath50_i$ ] .    in agreement with previous papers",
    ", we have found that the @xmath9 matrix element plays an important role in determining the low - energy spectrum of both @xmath2cd and @xmath3pd .",
    "however , as shown in some detail for @xmath3pd , it does not contribute to the energy spacings directly , but rather by changing the weights of the isovector contributions through the induced fragmentation .",
    "so to say , the pairing force pushed out the door comes back through the window .    in summary",
    ", we confirm the relevant role of the isoscalar spin - aligned coupling in the low - energy states of @xmath3pd and @xmath3cd . based on our study and the presently available data for @xmath3pd , we feel , however , that one can hardly speak of a new phase of nuclear matter similar to the well - known one induced by the strong pairing correlations between identical particles .",
