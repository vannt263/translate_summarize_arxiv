    "the _ ab initio _ time - dependent description of quantum many - body systems has been a major focus in the physics and chemistry communities since the invention of quantum mechanics . despite many efforts , up to the present time ,",
    "the exact ( analytic or numerical ) solution of the underlying equation of motion for the wavefunction @xmath0 of the system  the schrdinger equation  is , in general , restricted to only very few particles , due to the exponentially growing complexity with the particle number , e.g. @xcite . to overcome this limitation a great variety of methodologies",
    "have been developed to approximately describe systems of larger particle numbers .",
    "this includes time - dependent density functional theory @xcite , time - dependent hartree - fock @xcite , multi - configuration time - dependent hartree - fock @xcite , time - dependent coupled cluster theory @xcite , mller - plesset many - body perturbation theory @xcite , density matrix renormalization group based approaches @xcite or dynamical mean field theory , e.g. @xcite .    in this article , we focus on two different closely related powerful methods : non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) @xcite and reduced density operators ( do ) , e.g. @xcite , respectively .",
    "both methods involve the solution of a coupled hierarchy  the ms and bbgky hierarchy , respectively  of reduced quantities , where the solution of the full hierarchy is equivalent to the solution of the @xmath1-particle schrdinger equation or von neumann equation , in the case of pure or mixed states , respectively . to reduce the complexity , both methods aim at simplifications via a physically motivated truncation of the hierarchy .",
    "since both approaches are selfcontained and independent , comparisons of the two are of great interest for applications .",
    "negf are commonly regarded as more accurate , however , nonequilibrium solutions of the two - time equations of motion  the keldysh - kadanoff - baym equations ( kbe)are computationally very expensive .",
    "while there has been remarkable progress during the last decade for homogeneous @xcite and inhomogeneous systems , e.g. @xcite , the two - time structure puts strong limits on the achievable propagation time .",
    "in contrast , the single - time density operator approach does not suffer this problem .",
    "furthermore , recent solutions of the kbe for finite systems @xcite indicated unphysical long - time behavior ( damping ) . here , again solutions using single - time equations @xcite are , apparantly , closer to the exact result .",
    "it is , therefore , important to understand how the two - time and single - time approximations to the hierarchy are related to each other and whether and when single - time solutions are justified .",
    "the recipe how to derive the single - time approximation from the negf for an arbitrary selfenergy is the so - called generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz ( gkba ) derived by lipavsky , spicka and velicky @xcite .",
    "the gkba has , so far been used for spatially homogeneous systems , for electron - phonon scattering and for coulomb scattering in the second born approximation .",
    "numerical comparisons for the case of coulomb scattering have shown satisfactory agreement @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been recently made for finite systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a systematic analysis is still missing .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we discuss the relation between negf and do ( on the level of the second born approximation ) .",
    "we take the opposite route , compared to lipavsky et al . @xcite and derive the gkba result , starting from the bbgky - hierarchy and identifying the approximations necessary to obtain the gkba .",
    "second , we consider , as an example of the quantum dynamics of a finite system , the evolution of a 4-site hubbard nano - cluster  computed with green s functions and the gkba  and compare them to bbgky - based results by _",
    "akbari  et  al",
    ". _ @xcite using the wang / cassing approximation .",
    "in this section , we give a brief overview of the theoretical foundations of the two aforementioned methods for the statistical description of quantum many - body systems .",
    "one of the most basic differences between these two approaches is the incorporation of the spin statistics of the particles , which , e.g. , for fermions leads to the effect of pauli blocking @xcite . while the green s function method , which will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : negf ] , has the spin statistics intrinsically build in by use of bosonic / fermionic creation- and annhilation - operators , the reduced density operator theory is formulated for spinless particles , which requires an explicit ( anti-)symmetrization of the equations .",
    "this advantage of the former approach is at least partly counterfeited by the more complicated structure of the equations for the green s function @xmath2 , which depends  apart from the physical time @xmath3on an additional time argument @xmath4 , e.g. , providing access to the corresponding ionized system .",
    "numerically , this leads to comparatively more involved calculations with the green s function approach . to make up for that",
    ", the introduction of the gkba for the single - particle green s function allows for a simple approximate reconstruction of the two - time green s function from its time - diagonal value , by which a scaling of computation time comparable to density operator theory is achieved .      for an @xmath1-particle quantum system in a mixed state ( in contact with a stationary environment ) , the proper fundamental quantity is the @xmath1-particle density operator @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a possible micro - state compatible with a given macro - state of the whole system including the bath , and @xmath7 denotes the probability of its realization .",
    "this description is valid if the interaction of the system with the bath is weak .",

    "the solution of this equation completely determines the time evolution of the system and is equivalent to the solution of the schrdinger equation for all possible micro - states .      instead of the full @xmath1-particle density operator ,",
    "it is usually useful to consider reduced density operators , the @xmath12-particle operator @xmath13 being defined as a partial trace over the @xmath1-body density operator @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the volume , and the partial trace @xmath17 of an operator @xmath18 in an arbitrary basis of states @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 the density operators obey a system of equations of motion  the bbgky hierarchy that follows from taking the partial trace over eq .",

    "it is obvious that the whole hierarchy is equivalent to the von neumann equation .",
    "note that this system of equations is local in time , all functions depend on a single physical time @xmath3 , and it has to be complemented by initial conditions @xmath22 and so on . here @xmath23 is the single - particle hamiltonian whereas the two - particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 .",

    "we will add the appropriate exchange contributions in the next section where we consider the ( anti-)symmetrization and approximations to the bbgky hierarchy via a cluster expansion .",
    "for the practical analytical or numerical solution of the bbgky hierarchy , it is obvious that it has to be truncated to become tractable . a suitable approach consists in performing the so - called cluster expansion to separate the two - particle , three - particle and higher correlations from the ideal part of the density operator which is given by a product of single - particle operators , @xmath25 and analogously for the higher - order density operators .    to correctly account for the spin statistics of bosons ( fermions ) we now ( anti-)symmetrize all expressions .",
    "this can be done by introducing matrix representations with respect to an ( anti-)symmetrized system of basis states defined in fock space .",
    "alternatively , ( anti-)symmetric expectation values of observables can be computed with standard hilbert space states when the respective operators are ( anti-)symmetrized @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite.,width=491 ]    the results show that the hf - gkba performs very well for the propagation of a strong nonequilibrium initial state , especially in comparison with time - dependent hartree - fock , that does not show a decrease of the oscillation amplitude at all , present in the exact solution . comparing the amplitudes with the exact ones , the gkba overestimates them , though . in the part from @xmath140 on",

    "[ fig : sneq2 ] , it is obvious that the wc solution has a very good agreement of the oscillation frequency up to @xmath141 , but the height of the peaks is much overestimated for time @xmath142 , both compared to the exact ones as well as to those computed with the gkba .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , within the second order born approximation , we can establish a one - to - one correspondence between nonequilibrium green s functions within the gkba and reduced density operator theory , yielding the same formulas for the equation of motion of the single - particle density matrix . on the example of the free evolution of a four - electron quantum dot from a strong nonequilibrium initial state we have shown the overall satisfactory agreement of the hf - gkba to the exact dynamics of the system far away from equilibrium , for weak interaction strength .",
    "this is encouraging since the hf - gkba allows for long propation times that are impossible to achieve with full two - time calculations and it retains most of the attractive properties of negf , such as time reversibility , total energy conservation and memory effects , e.g. @xcite . in the future , it will be very interesting to examine the potential of the gkba for higher order selfenergy schemes such as @xmath143- or @xmath144-matrix ( ladder ) approximation . for the t - matrix approximation for homogeneous macroscopic systems , a similar correspondence has been found previously @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to extend this correspondence to inhomogeneous finite systems in order to achieve long propagations also for strongly coupled systems and to verify whether the gkba is here able , as well , to remove the unphysical damping observed in two - time calculations @xcite .",
