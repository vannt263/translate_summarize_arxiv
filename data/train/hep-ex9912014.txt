    "the key question of calorimetry generally and hadronic calorimetry in particular is the energy reconstruction .",
    "this question is especially important when a hadronic calorimeter have a complex structure being a combined calorimeter .",
    "such is the combined calorimeter of the atlas detector @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe the new simple method of the energy reconstruction for a combined calorimeter , which we called the @xmath0 method , and demonstrate its performance on the basis of the test beam data of the atlas combined prototype calorimeter .",
    "the combined calorimeter prototype setup has been made consisting of the lar electromagnetic calorimeter prototype inside the cryostat and downstream the tile calorimeter prototype as shown in fig .",
    "[ fv1 ] .",
    "the two calorimeters have been placed with their central axes at an angle to the beam of @xmath3 . at this angle",
    "the two calorimeters have an active thickness of 10.3 @xmath4 .",
    "beam quality and geometry were monitored with a set of beam wire chambers bc1 , bc2 , bc3 and trigger hodoscopes placed upstream of the lar cryostat . to detect punchthrough particles and to measure the effect of longitudinal leakage a `` muon wall '' consisting of",
    "10 scintillator counters ( each 2 cm thick ) was located behind the calorimeters at a distance of about 1 metre .",
    "the electromagnetic lar calorimeter prototype consists of a stack of three azimuthal modules , each one spanning @xmath5 in azimuth and extending over 2 m along the z direction .",
    "the calorimeter structure is defined by 2.2 mm thick steel - plated lead absorbers , folded to an accordion shape and separated by 3.8 mm gaps , filled with liquid argon .",
    "the signals are collected by kapton electrodes located in the gaps .",
    "the calorimeter extends from an inner radius of 131.5 cm to an outer radius of 182.6 cm , representing ( at @xmath6 ) a total of 25 radiation lengths ( @xmath7 ) , or 1.22 interaction lengths ( @xmath4 ) for protons .",
    "the calorimeter is longitudinally segmented into three compartments of @xmath8 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "more details about this prototype can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cryostat has a cylindrical form with 2 m internal diameter , filled with liquid argon , and is made out of a 8 mm thick inner stainless - steel vessel , isolated by 30 cm of low - density foam ( rohacell ) , itself protected by a 1.2 mm thick aluminum outer wall .",
    "the hadronic tile calorimeter is a sampling device using steel as the absorber and scintillating tiles as the active material @xcite .",
    "the innovative feature of the design is the orientation of the tiles which are placed in planes perpendicular to the z direction @xcite . for a better sampling homogeneity",
    "the 3 mm thick scintillators are staggered in the radial direction .",
    "the tiles are separated along z by 14 mm of steel , giving a steel / scintillator volume ratio of 4.7 .",
    "wavelength shifting fibres ( wls ) running radially collect light from the tiles at both of their open edges .",
    "the hadron calorimeter prototype consists of an azimuthal stack of five modules .",
    "each module covers @xmath10 in azimuth and extends 1 m along the z direction , such that the front face covers @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "the radial depth , from an inner radius of 200 cm to an outer radius of 380 cm , accounts for 8.9 @xmath13 at @xmath6   ( 80.5 @xmath7 ) .",
    "read - out cells are defined by grouping together a bundle of fibres into one photomultiplier ( pmt ) .",
    "each of the 100 cells is read out by two pmts and is fully projective in azimuth ( with @xmath14 ) , while the segmentation along the z axis is made by grouping fibres into read - out cells spanning @xmath15 cm ( @xmath16 ) and is therefore not projective each module is read out in four longitudinal segments ( corresponding to about 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 and 3 @xmath4 at @xmath6 ) .",
    "more details of this prototype can be found in @xcite .",
    "data were taken on the h8 beam of the cern sps , with pion and electron beams of 20 , 40 , 50 , 80 , 100 , 150 and 300 gev .",
    "we applied some similar to @xcite cuts to eliminate the non - single track pion events , the beam halo , the events with an interaction before lar calorimeter , the electron and muon events .",
    "the set of cuts is the following :    * the single - track pion events were selected by requiring the pulse height of the beam scintillation counters and the energy released in the presampler of the electromagnetic calorimeter to be compatible with that for a single particle ; * the beam halo events were removed with appropriate cuts on the horizontal and vertical positions of the incoming track impact point and the space angle with respect to the beam axis as measured with the beam chambers ; * the electron events were removed by the requirement that the energy deposited in the lar calorimeter is less than 90 % of the beam energy ; * a cut on the total energy rejects incoming muon ; * to select the events with the hadronic shower origins in the first sampling of the lar calorimeter ; events with the energy depositions in this sampling compatible with that of a single minimum ionization particle were rejected ; * to select the events with the well developed hadronic showers energy depositions were required to be more than 10 % of the beam energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and less than 70 % in the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "before going into description of the @xmath0 method for the energy reconstruction we will first briefly review the existing algorithms used earlier for the energy reconstruction of the atlas combined prototype calorimeter .",
    "three different algorithms have been developed in order to reconstruct the hadron energy of the atlas combined prototype calorimeter @xcite :    * the benchmark method @xcite , * the sampling weighting method , * the cells weighting method @xcite .",
    "the benchmark algorithm is designed to be simple . with this method",
    "the incident energy is reconstructed with a minimal number of parameters ( all energy independent with the exception of one ) .",
    "the energy of the particle is obtained as the sum of four terms :    1 .",
    "the sum of the signals in the electromagnetic calorimeter , @xmath17 , expressed in gev using the calibration from electrons .",
    "2 .   a term proportional to the charge deposited in the hadronic calorimeter , @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   a term to account for the energy lost in the cryostat , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "4 .   a negative correction term , proportional to @xmath22 . for showers that begin in the @xmath23 calorimeter",
    ", this term crudely accounts for its non - compensating behaviour .",
    "the reconstructed energy is : @xmath24 the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 were determined by minimizing the fractional energy resolution @xmath28 of 300 gev pions .",
    "however the reconstructed energy is systematically underestimated .",
    "for this reason an additional step of rescaling is necessary .    to rescale the reconstructed energy @xmath29 to the beam energy @xmath30",
    "the following expression was used : @xmath31          +    f_{tile } \\left [ 1 - f_h          \\left ( 1- \\left ( \\frac{\\epsilon_h}{\\epsilon_e } \\right)_{tile }          \\right ) \\right ] } \\ ,   \\label{eq : dg2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the energy - dependent fraction of the incident hadron energy , which is transferred to the electromagnetic sector , and given as a function of beam energy as in @xcite , two terms in the denominator are weighted by the average fractions of energy deposited in the lar ( @xmath34 ) and tile ( @xmath35 ) calorimeters , taken from the data , the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( different for the two calorimeters ) were found by fitting for all beam energies and turned out to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 . as remarked in @xcite , the @xmath40 and @xmath41 values in the expression ( [ eq : dg2 ] ) do not have the usual meaning as the calorimeter response to hadrons and electrons because they are determined not from the raw signals but from @xmath29 , which already includes corrections .",
    "the rescaled mean values @xmath42 reasonably agreed with the nominal beam energies .",
    "the sampling weighting algorithm is based on a separate correction parameter for each longitudinal compartment of the two calorimeters .",
    "these parameters are independently optimized for each incident energy and are indeed found to be energy - dependent .",
    "the correction strategy chosen here is to adjust downwards the response of the read - out cells with a large signal to compensate for the response to large em energy clusters , typically due to @xmath43 production .",
    "a separate weighting parameter was introduced for each longitudinal sampling .",
    "the energy measured in each readout cell @xmath44 is corrected according to the formula : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy sum over all cells of sampling @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the ( positive ) weight to be optimized for each sampling @xmath47 . in total eight energy - dependent parameters",
    "must be determined : one for each of the seven samplings , plus an additional conversion factor @xmath49 to convert the hadronic signal from charge to energy .",
    "it turned out that the sampling weighting technique improves the energy resolution but does not improve the linearity obtained with the benchmark approach .",
    "the cells weighting method relies on correcting upwards the response of cells with relatively small signals , in order to equalize their response to that of cells with large ( typically electromagnetic ) deposited energies .",
    "the total energy is reconstructed correcting the energy in each cell of either calorimeter by a factor ( typically @xmath50 ) which is a function of the energy in each cell and of the beam energy .",
    "the reconstructed energy is expressed as : @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the weights to be determined .",
    "the total number of parameters is reduced to 8 ( including the cryostat constant ) . by minimizing the energy resolution ( with the constraint that the mean reconstructed energy reproduces the nominal beam energy ) , a value for each @xmath54 is found .    in all these methods",
    "the parameters are determined by minimization .",
    "so , it is necessary to have sufficiently large and unbiased sample of events and to perform the sophisticated off - line data treatment . besides , for the two first methods it is necessary to rescale the reconstructed energy in order to obtain the nominal beam energy values .",
    "the response , @xmath55 of a calorimeter to a hadronic shower is the sum of the contributions from the electromagnetic , @xmath56 , and hadronic , @xmath57 , parts of the incident energy @xcite",
    "@xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is the energy independent coefficient of transformation of the electromagnetic ( pure hadronic , low - energy hadronic activity ) energy to response , @xmath62 is the fraction of electromagnetic energy . from this @xmath63",
    "where @xmath64    for a combined calorimeter the beam energy , @xmath30 , deposits into the lar compartment , @xmath17 , the tilecal compartment , @xmath65 , and into the passive material between the lar and tile calorimeters , @xmath19 , @xmath66    using the expressions ( [ ev16 ] ) - ( [ ev13 ] ) the following equation for the energy reconstruction has been derived : @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 is the energy released in the third depth of the electromagnetic calorimeter , @xmath74 is the energy released in the first depth of the hadronic calorimeter . in order to use the equation ( [ ev7 ] )",
    "it is necessary to know the values of the following constants which have been taken from @xcite and equal to : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "note that the above formulae have been represented earlier in our work @xcite devoted to the determination of the @xmath81 ratio of the lar electromagnetic compartment of the atlas barrel combined prototype calorimeter .      for the energy reconstruction by the formula ( [ ev7 ] ) it is necessary to know the @xmath82 ratio and the reconstructed energy itself .",
    "therefore , the iteration procedure has been developed .",
    "two iteration cycles were made .",
    "the first one is devoted to the determination of the @xmath82 ratio . the expression ( [ ept ] ) can be written as @xmath83 as the first approximation , the value of @xmath82 is calculated using the following equation @xmath84 where in the right side of this equation we used @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath86 .",
    "the obtained value @xmath82 in @xmath87-iteration ( @xmath88 ) are used in @xmath89-iteration in the right side of the equation ( [ epti ] ) and the iteration continues .",
    "the iteration process is stopped when the convergence criterion @xmath90 is satisfied .",
    "the second iteration cycle is the determination of energy . as the first approximation",
    ", the value of @xmath29 is calculated using the following equation with the @xmath82 ratio obtained in the first iteration cycle @xmath91 where @xmath92 in the right side of this equation we used @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath94 .",
