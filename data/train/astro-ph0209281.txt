    "more recent efforts are directed to derive the dust grain size distribution in a circumstellar disk from its sed ( wood et al .  2002 ; dalessio , calvet & hartman  2001 ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that beside strong observational constrains , the model parameters and considered physical processes have to be questioned in depth in order to derive such detailed conclusions .",
    "however , looking behind the scenes , many of the rt models are based on simplifying assumptions of very basic processes such as isotropic instead of anisotropic scattering , mean dust parameters representing dust grain ensembles ( different radii and chemical compositions ) , or the flux - limited diffusion approximation - approximations which are well - suited for handling the energy transfer in hydrodynamic simulations or a rough data analysis but which may not necessarily guarantee the desired accuracy for a detailed sed and image / polarization data analysis .    in the advent of ( space ) observatories such as sirtf , which will be able to obtain seds of evolved debris disks around young stars , there exists a strong need for adequate numerical rt techniques in order to allow to trace dust grain growth ( meyer et al .",

    "therefore , we clearly have to understand which influence the different approximations ( as long as they are required ) in the rt simulations may have on the resulting observables . based on two different grain size distributions consisting of astronomical silicate , the differences in the resulting dust grain temperature distributions and the resulting seds between simulations of the rt in ( a ) a `` real '' dust grain mixture and ( b ) under the assumption ( approximation ) of mean dust grain parameters will be discussed .",
    "this investigation is therefore mainly focused on two questions : ( 1 ) of what order of magnitude are the differences ( ? ) and ( 2 ) how many grain sizes have to be considered to represent the properties of a real grain size distribution ?",
    "the spatial temperature distribution of the considered dust configurations is calculated on the basis of local thermal equilibrium .",

    "the rt simulations presented in this article have been performed with the three - dimensional continuum rt code mc3d which has been described by wolf & henning  2000 ( see also wolf , henning , & stecklum  1999 ; wolf  2002 ) .",

    "furthermore , the method described by lucy  ( 1999 ) , which takes into account the absorption not only at the points of interaction of the photons with the dust grains but also in - between , has been applied . while the first method allows to simulate the rt for optical depths refers to the optical depth based on the extinction cross section of the dust grains at a wavelength of 550 nm . ]",

    "the optical properties such as the extinction and scattering cross sections as well as the scattering distribution function have been derived on the basis of mie scattering , using the mie scattering algorithm published by bohren & huffman ( 1983 ) .",
    "the correct ( anisotropic ) scattering distribution function ( for each dust grain size ) has been considered in the rt process .",
    "in case of non - self - consistent rt in a dust grain mixture , the numerical effort ( finally , the computing time and ram requirement ) may be substantially decreased by assuming weighted mean values of those parameters which describe the interaction of the electromagnetic field with the dust grains : the extinction , absorption , and scattering cross section , the stokes parameters , and  as as function of the extinction and scattering cross section  the albedo .    the weight @xmath32 , which represents the contribution of the @xmath24th component of the dust grain mixture , results from the abundance of this component in respect of its dust grain number density ( assuming @xmath14 chemically different dust species ) and the size distribution of the respective material : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the minimum and maximum grain radius of the size distribution .",
    "the stokes parameters as well as the extinction , absorption , and scattering cross section ( @xmath20 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) are additive .",
    "therefore , the representative values in case of a dust grain mixture can be derived on the basis of their weighted contributions ( see , e.g. , martin  1978 , solc  1980 ) : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mueller matrix which is used to describe the modification of the photon s stokes vector due to the interaction of a photon with the scattering / absorbing medium ( dust grains ; see bickel & bailey  1985 , bohren & huffman  1983 ) . for the albedo @xmath43",
    "follows : @xmath44 since this formalism ( eq .",
    "[ weight]-[albmean ] ) covers both grain size and chemical distributions , the conclusions to be derived for a grain size distribution but a single chemical component is also valid for grain ensembles consisting of grains with different chemical compositions .",
    "the mean dust grain parameters used in the following sections have been derived on the assumption of @xmath45 grain radii equidistantly distributed in the grain size range of the small / large grain ensemble .    in thermal equilibrium , the temperature of a dust grain ( @xmath46th grain size or composition ) can be estimated from the assumption of local energy conservation .",
    "if @xmath47 is the energy being absorbed by the @xmath46th dust grain component during the time interval @xmath48 , then the local energy conservation can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the total amount of energy being re - emitted during the time interval @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the monochromatic absorbed / re - emitted luminosity at the wavelength @xmath6 , @xmath54 is the absorption efficiency and @xmath55 is the planck function of the grain with the temperature @xmath56 . for two particles of the same composition but different radii ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 )",
    "the temperature is consequently only the same if @xmath59 this is usually not the case .",
    "thus , mean dust grain parameters may be used only in case of the simulation of dust scattering but not for the estimation of the dust grain temperature distribution and resulting observables , such as the spectral energy distribution and images in the mid - infrared to millimeter wavelength range .    in the following sections (  [ rtem ] and  [ sed ] ) it will be investigated under which conditions the approximation of the mean dust grain parameters provides nevertheless a good estimate for these observables . while the most crucial information can be derived on the basis of a one - dimensional model (  [ rtem ] ) , the study presented in ",
    "[ sed ] is aimed to reveal the influence of geometrical effects in case of two - dimensional disk - like structures . in each case , typical parameters for both the dust grain composition ( see  [ rtmodel ] ) and the circumstellar shells / disks are considered .",
    "in order to reveal the differences between the results of the rt based on real dust grain size distributions and the approximation of mean dust grain parameters representing the weighted mean optical parameters of the grain size distribution , a simple - structured but in respect of the astrophysical applications very useful model has been used for the following investigations .",

    "four values ( -1.0 , -1.5 , -2.0 , and -2.5 ) for the exponent @xmath62 were chosen , covering a broad range of astrophysical objects ranging from circumstellar shells ( see , e.g. , chini et al .",

    "no remarkable differences to the case @xmath66 are expected since multiple scattering and reemission have a negligible influence on the dust grain temperature which is determined only by the distance from the star ( attenuation of the stellar radiation field ) and the absorption efficiency of the dust grains . for optical depths",
    "@xmath67 preparatory studies have shown that the temperature difference between the different dust grains becomes negligible , converging towards the temperature distribution obtained on the basis of the mean dust grain approximation .",
    "this finding is in agreement with results obtained by krgel & walmsley  ( 1984  investigation of dust and gas temperatures in dense molecular cores ) , wolfire & churchwell  ( 1987  study of circumstellar shells around low - mass , pre - main - sequence stars ) , and efstathiou & rowan - robinson  ( 1994  multi - grain dust cloud models of compact hii regions ) .",

    "the temperature of the different grains spans a range of @xmath70k ( @xmath71% of the corresponding mean temperature ) around the temperature of the mean grains at the inner boundary of the shell .",

    "the relativ density gradient , described by the exponent @xmath62 is of minor importance .",
    "however , an increase of the absolute amount of this exponent results in an increased redistribution of energy between the different dust grain components at the inner boundary of the shell ( @xmath72 ) and therefore in a decrease of the temperature dispersion .",
    "the difference ( @xmath73 ) strongly depends on both the absorption efficiency , and thus on the dust grain size distribution , and the temperature of the heating source since the combination of these parameters determines the amount of energy being absorbed .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by the different signs of the temperature difference of the large and the small grain size distribution to the temperature of the mean grains shown in fig .",
    "[ s6txax2 ] and [ s6ta - b2 ] .",
    "the found complex , highly dispersed temperature structure in a dust grain mixture requires a large number ( here : @xmath74 ) of considered grain radii to be correctly taken into account and can not be adequately represented by a mean particle .",
    "this finding is of special interest for the simulation of chemical networks , since the existence of ice layers , the possibility of a certain reaction on the grain surface , surface reaction rates , and the temperature of the surrounding gas phase depend on the dust grain temperature ( see , e.g. , cazaux & tielens  2002 , markwick et al .",

    "however , the vertical temperature structure shows a more complex behaviour in the inner region of the disk , on a size scale of a few au and smaller . here , an _ inversion _ of the temperature difference in the upper layer of the optically thick disk occurs ,",
    "i.e. , the large grains are substantially warmer than the small grains .",
    "this remarkable effect can be explained by the more efficient heating of large grains by the mid - infrared to far - infrared reemission of the hot inner disk .",

    "[ disk - g ] shows the temperature difference @xmath99 as a function of the grain radius @xmath100 and radial distance from the star at different distances from the midplane .",
    "while at a radial distance of 0.05au the temperature of the 20@xmath101 m grains is about 130k higher than that of @xmath102 grains in the `` inversion layer '' , the amount of this temperature difference drops to less than @xmath103 at a radial distance of 0.5au from the star ( see fig .  [ disk - z ] ) .",
    "consequently , the vertical extent and location of the minimum of the temperature inversion region depends on the particular grain size ( and the vertical density distribution in the disk ) .",
    "for instance it was found that the minimum of the @xmath104 distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ disk - z ] is shifted towards smaller distances from the midplane in all three considered cases ( @xmath105=0.05au , 0.1au , and 0.5au ) .",
    "according to the explanation of the temperature inversion given above , a similar shift of the minima of the difference temperature distribution is expected in case of the other grain sizes ( 0.01@xmath90 to 1.1@xmath90 ) as well .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of the simulated temperature distribution is too low to allow the verification of this assumption .",
    "based on the dust grain temperature distribution shown in fig .",

    "[ sed1 ] illustrates , the results of the real grain size distribution converges towards the results based on the approximation of mean dust grain parameters . as it also shows , a minimum of @xmath111 to @xmath74 grain sizes have to be considered to achieve deviations of less then @xmath112 .",
    "if too few single grain sizes are considered , the sed does not represent the observable sed of the real grain size distribution sufficiently but drastically overestimates    1 .",
    "the absorption of the stellar radiation ( and therefore underestimates the visual to near - infrared sed ) , 2 .",
    "the depths of the absorption bands in general ( as the silicate absorption feature at @xmath113 m demonstrates ) , and 3 .   the dust reemission spectrum in the near - infrared to millimeter wavelength range .",
    "while the different absorption behaviour influences the temperature structure and overall sed in general , the influence of the different scattering behaviour depends on the optical depth . in the optically thin case , differences in the scattering behaviour result mainly in deviations of the short wavelength region of the stellar sed . at higher optical depth ,",
    "the scattering behaviour has direct influence on the energy transfer in the dust envelope and thus on the temperature structure and the near- to far - infrared wavelength range as well .",
    "however , this effect is of importance only at intermediate optical depths ( @xmath114 ) , since for even higher optical depths the temperature structure , at least in case of a one - dimensional dust configuration , tends not to depend on the description of the dust grain ensemble ( real dust grain size distribution / approximation of mean dust grain parameters ) .",
    "in simulations of the radiative transfer in the circumstellar environment of young stellar objects it has been widely established to use mean values for those parameters which describe the interaction of the electromagnetic field with the dust grains ( see , e.g. , modelling efforts by calvet et al .",

    "furthermore , the calculation of the spatial temperature distribution for all grains of different sizes and chemical composition requires significantly more computing power since ( a ) the heating by the primary sources ( e.g. , the star embedded in a circumstellar envelope ) has to be performed independently for each grain species , and ( b ) the number of computing steps required to model the subsequent mutual heating of the different dust grain species due to dust re - emission scales even as @xmath115 , where @xmath14 is the number of chemically different components and @xmath15 is the number of separate dust grain radii considered .",
    "while these simulations are feasible in case of one - dimensional models ( see , e.g. , chini , krgel , & kreysa  1986 and efstathiou & rowan - robinson  1994 : dust emission from star forming region ; krgel & siebenmorgen  1994 and siebenmorgen , krgel , & zota  1999 : radiative transfer in galactic nulei ) or simple - structured two - dimensional models ( menshchikov & henning  1997 : circumstellar disks ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson  1994 : disks in active galactic nuclei ) , it is hardly possible to handle two- and three - dimensional models with high density gradients and/or high optical depth which require high - resolution temperature grids .    in this study ,",

    "however , the relative difference between the sed based on a real dust grain size distribution on the one hand and the approximation of mean dust grain parameters on the other hand was found to be smaller than about @xmath11610% if a minimum number of @xmath111 to @xmath74 grain sizes have been considered .    as the temperature structure in a circumstellar disk  based on the model for hh30  shows , the geometry of the density distribution is a significant parameter for the resulting temperature differences between grains of different size , too . in the inner region of the disk with a diameter of a few au a temperature inversion layer",
    "was found where the sign of the temperature difference of the largest and smallest grains is reverted . as this and the results obtained on the basis of the spherical shell (  [ spsh ] ) show , the dust grain temperature structure is not sufficiently represented by dust grains with mean optical parameters . on the one hand , this is of tremendous importance for the simulation of chemical networks since the largest deviations from results based on the approximation of mean dust grain parameters have been found in the inner hot , dense region of the shell / disk where the chemical evolution takes place on its smallest timescale . on the other hand , the complex temperature structure may significantly change the hydrostatic properties of the considered gas / dust density distribution itself .",

    "furthermore , the influence on processes taking place in more evolved circumstellar disks , such as the dust settling and dust grain growth , have to be considered taking into account the temperature structure of real grain size distributions .",

    "i wish to thank the referee e.  dwek who helped to improve the clarity of the presentation of the results .",
