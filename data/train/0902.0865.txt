    "pion production in heavy - ion collisions at a few gev per nucleon is the dominant channel for particle emission .",
    "kaon emission , however , is a rare processes at these energies . in nucleon - nucleon interactions ,",
    "the threshold for pion production is 0.29 gev , for k@xmath0 it is 1.58 gev and for k@xmath1 it is 2.5 gev . for kaons",
    "the required energy also contains the mass of the lightest associate partner to be produced in order to conserve strangeness , being a @xmath2 for the k@xmath0 and a k@xmath0 for the k@xmath1 .",
    "pions are predominantly produced in first - chance nucleon - nucleon collisions , while kaons being created below threshold , require that energy is accumulated by various means . as a consequence ,",
    "the k@xmath0 mesons are produced only during the high - density phase , and therefore these particles are considered as ideal probes for the hot and dense fireball .",
    "being produced inside the collision zone , the fate of these particles is quite different .",
    "the pion - nucleon cross section is large and thus pions are absorbed through the @xmath3 resonance and re - emitted by the decay of this resonance .",
    "this creation and disappearance occurs during the entire time evolution of the collision .",
    "the k@xmath0-nucleon cross section , on the other hand , is small , which is due to strangeness and energy conservation .",
    "there are no partners to react with and only elastic scattering and charge exchange can happen .",
    "the k@xmath1 production process is quite different from k@xmath0 .",
    "the production threshold is much higher .",
    "yet there is an alternative production channel possible , as suggested by ko  @xcite and demonstrated in refs .",
    "the strangeness - exchange reaction @xmath5 has a large cross section ( with y being @xmath2 or @xmath6 ) .",
    "the inverse channel causes the produced k@xmath1 to be able to be absorbed  @xcite . as in the pion case",
    ", the succession of absorption and creation causes the k@xmath1 emission to be in the late stage of the reaction .",
    "in addition , strange hadrons carry information on the properties of the medium in which they are created and through which they are propagating due to kn potential interaction  @xcite .",
    "the effective in - medium mass of k@xmath0 mesons increases with density , since the potential is slightly repulsive , while the k@xmath1 potential is strongly attractive and decreases with density .",
    "early experiments have been carried out at the bevalac accelerator .",
    "systematic , high - statistics measurements of pion and kaon production became feasible with the advent of the sis accelerator at gsi .",
    "in this short review , mainly results from the kaos collaboration  @xcite are given , and some examples of recent iqmd calculations  @xcite .",
    "a recent review on pion emission can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a survey of the production yields of pions and kaons in inclusive collisions of a light ( c+c ) and a heavy ( au+au ) system are given in fig .",
    "[ k_sigma_energy ] as a function of beam energy where the ordinate is @xmath7 which represents the multiplicity per mass number @xmath8 of the colliding system .",
    "as can be seen from this figure the pion multiplicity per @xmath8 is higher in the lighter system which reflects likely the influence of absorption of pions and holds only at these low incident energies .",
    "in contrast , for k@xmath0 production the inverse observation is made .",
    "= 9.0 cm    the key mechanism for the k@xmath0 production in heavy - ion reactions close to the threshold is a multi - step process where the energy necessary for the production is accumulated and stored in intermediate resonances .",
    "higher densities increase the number of these collisions and especially second generation collisions like @xmath9 with sufficiently high relative momentum to create a k@xmath0 occur most frequently during the high - density phase of the reaction .",
    "this has nicely been demonstrated by iqmd calculations  @xcite showing that also well above the corresponding nn threshold the channel @xmath9 dominates the k@xmath0 production .",
    "the yield of  is about two orders of magnitude lower due to the much higher threshold .",
    "figure  [ k_sigma_a ] , left , shows the multiplicities of k@xmath0 mesons per mass number @xmath8 from inclusive reactions as a function of @xmath8 at several incident energies as well as those of k@xmath1 mesons at @xmath10  @xmath8  gev .",
    "the lines in fig .",
    "[ k_sigma_a ] are functions @xmath11 fitted to the data with the resulting values for @xmath12 given in the figure . for k@xmath0 production the extracted values of @xmath12",
    "decrease with incident energy .",
    "this reflects the decreasing influence of the intermediate energy storage via @xmath3 and hence the influence of the density .",
    "considering the much higher threshold for k@xmath1 production , one would expect that @xmath12 is much larger at comparable incident energies .",
    "however , at 1.5 @xmath8  gevthe values for k@xmath0 and for k@xmath1 production are about equal .",
    "this confirms that the k@xmath1 production is linked to the k@xmath0 production .",
    "mesons are dominantly created by strangeness exchange converting a hyperon and a pion into a  and a nucleon .",
    "figure  [ k_sigma_a ] , right , shows the multiplicity per number of participating nucleons @xmath13 for ni+ni and au+au collisions at 1.5 @xmath8  gev as a function of @xmath14 and demonstrates that the multiplicities per @xmath14 of pions does not change with @xmath14 while both kaon species exhibit the same rise despite the fact that the thresholds for the production of the two particles species in binary nn - collisions are very different .",
    "this is observed in as well as in collisions with comparable multiplicities at the same @xmath14 .",
    "again , this observation confirms the strong relation between k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 production .    as a consequence of this observation ,",
    "the ratio as a function of @xmath14 is constant as a function of @xmath14 and is even the same for two different systems .",
    "again , at first glance it is astonishing that in central collisions with high densities the k@xmath1/k@xmath0 ratio is the same as in peripheral ones . yet , considering the observation from fig .",
    "[ k_sigma_a ] , right , it is expected .",
    "remarkable is that a statistical model is able to describe these ratios  @xcite .",
    "all these observations indicate that k@xmath1 are essentially created by the strangeness - exchange mechanism and it has been shown by applying the law - of - mass action that this channel might reach chemical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "both k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 mesons are produced in a complicated sequence of interactions .",
    "figure  [ midrap ] shows k@xmath0 and k@xmath1 spectra at midrapidity as a function of the kinetic energy @xmath15 for three different systems and various beam energies .",
    "the spectra have a boltzmann shape to a very good approximation .",
    "two general trends can be seen from this figure : ( i ) the slopes of the k@xmath0 are always higher than those of k@xmath1 .",
    "( ii ) heavy systems exhibit higher slopes than lighter ones .",
    "it is interesting to study the different components and effects contributing to the k@xmath0 slope in an iqmd study  @xcite .",
    "initially , the energy available for k@xmath0 production is low and the slope at creations is therefore quite steep as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ spectra - effects ] .",
    "the final slopes are influenced by re - scattering of the k@xmath0 in the medium and by the repulsion from k@xmath0n potential as demonstrated in this figure .",
    "re - scattering dramatically increases the slope .",
    "this effect increases as the beam energy increases and as the mass of the system increases as there is more scattering in heavier systems .",
    "the expected repulsive k@xmath0 potential increases the production threshold and might modify the spectra only at low momenta which are difficult to detect due to the kaon decay . for experimental reasons kaons at low momenta",
    "can be studied best with neutral k@xmath16 mesons  @xcite .",
    "one might be astonished that scattering contributes so strongly as the mean free path of k@xmath0 is about 5 fm . yet",
    ", k@xmath0 are produced at about twice normal nuclear matter density and mostly inside the collision zone .",
    "hence , the mean free path decreases drastically and k@xmath0 have to travel a distance before leaving the system as shown in  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the k@xmath1 is influenced by scattering the same way as the k@xmath0 , yet scattering occurs less frequently since absorption dominates when k@xmath1 interact with nuclei . according to iqmd calculations only about 20% of the k@xmath1 produced in au+au finally leave the system as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec_abs_nc_pot ] .",
    "furthermore , due to the momentum dependence of the absorption , the low momenta of the k@xmath1 undergo stronger absorption which leads to an increase in slope or apparent temperature .",
    "the influence of the kn potential is only visible at low momenta which are very difficult to measure .    in order to put these various observables in relation to the expected in - medium properties of kaons , it is useful to study the emission time of the two kaon species and the corresponding density profiles .",
    "figure  [ density - time ] shows on the left side the time distributions of kaons at the point of production and at the time of last contact . as discussed before , k@xmath1 are produced later than k@xmath0 and they also leave the system later . the right hand side of figure  [ density - time ] shows the corresponding density distributions .",
    "the bulk of the k@xmath0 is produced when the density is twice nuclear matter density and their yield can not be changed between production and emission due to strangeness conservation .",
    "this fact is the key property as to why the  gives access to the high - density phase and thus allows one to extract the nuclear equation of state .",
    "in contrast , the k@xmath1 are predominantly produced and emitted later and from a region of density below nuclear matter density . from this model study , it is obvious that heavy - ion reactions in the 1 to 2 @xmath8  gevregime are well suited to also study k@xmath0 potential effects , but they are not likely to yield results on k@xmath1 potential effects since those effects are expected to be small at densities below nuclear matter density .",
    "one of the challenging questions of nuclear physics is the determination of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "one of the very successful strategies refers to the study of monopole vibrations which yields a value for the compression modulus @xmath4 of 235@xmath17 14 mev  @xcite with @xmath18 at the equilibrium point .",
    "this information is however , limited to tiny density variations around @xmath19 .",
    "heavy - ion collisions are ideally suited to reach high densities and they might allow us to extract further information on the eos . in semi - central heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "an in - plane flow is created due to the transverse pressure on the baryons outside of the interaction region with this flow being proportional to the transverse pressure .",
    "these studies have not yet lead to clear results  @xcite and earlier conclusions  @xcite have to be taken with care .",
    "the most promising method seems to be the strangeness production and its sensitivity to the energy available during the hot and compressed phase as first pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "however , a comparison of the k@xmath0 excitation function with model calculations suffers from uncertainties in the input quantities and also on the unknown influence of the k@xmath0 n potential .",
    "it has been realized that many of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties disappear if ratios of k@xmath0 multiplicities are used  @xcite .",
    "the double ratio @xmath20 turns out to be directly sensitive to the stiffness of eos . in c+c collisions",
    "the densities hardly exceed @xmath19 providing a good normalization to cancel out systematic uncertainties both in the experimental data and in unknown input quantities of the transport model calculations .",
    "this ratio is plotted in fig .",
    "[ eos ] as a function of the beam energy for a soft ( bold red lines ) and a hard ( thin blue ) eos .",
    "the dotted lines refer to rqmd calculations by fuchs @xcite and both calculations agree quite well .",
    "this figure elucidates again the sensitivity of the eos being higher at the lowest beam energies , and demonstrates that only a soft eos is compatible with the experimental data of the kaos collaboration  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to have a robust observable one has to demonstrate that the uncertainties of the input variables do not render the conclusion useless .",
    "therefore , detailed calculations with different @xmath21 cross section , with and without kn potential and for different lifetimes of the delta resonance have been performed and none of these uncertainties is able to weaken the previous conclusion that only a soft eos is compatible with the observed excitation function of the k@xmath0 yield  @xcite .",
    "can this conclusion on the eos be confirmed independently ?",
    "instead of varying the size of the system one can also vary the centrality . because a higher centrality of the collisions yields a higher compression we expect that the k@xmath0 yield per participant as a function of the centrality depends as well on the eos .",
    "the measured dependence of @xmath13 with @xmath14 exhibits a rise @xmath22 shown in fig .",
    "[ k_sigma_a ] , right .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath23 for au+au collisions at 1.5 @xmath8  gev  @xcite is shown , as the band in fig .",
    "[ eos ] , right .",
    "the dashed line shows iqmd calculations and also for this observable the data of the kaos collaboration are only compatible with values of k around 200 mev .",
    "thus two independent observables point towards a rather low compression modulus .",
    "the two kaon species exhibit quiet distinct differences when produced in heavy - ion reactions below or at the threshold in nn collisions .",
    "mesons are created in associate production together with hyperons .",
    "this happens mainly in multi - step processes via the intermediate @xmath3 resonance . according to transport model calculations",
    ", they are produced early  around 7 fm / c  and at densities around twice normal nuclear matter . before leaving the collision zone",
    ", they scatter quite often which causes their spectral slopes to be increased , but not changing their yield .",
    "hence , the production yields of  mesons have been used to extract the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "hints for a repulsive  n potential have been found , but this remains an open issue .",
