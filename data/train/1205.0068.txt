    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) hosting a supermassive black hole , with relativistic jets pointing close to the line of sight to the observer .",
    "the small viewing angle of the jet makes it possible to observe strong relativistic effects , such as a boosting of the emitted power and shortening of the characteristic time scales .",
    "blazars are typically identified in radio and optical surveys , their defining characteristics being radio loudness , flat spectrum and compact morphology in the radio band , some degree of optical polarization , and fast , large - amplitude variability .             since the first detection of a blazar in the very - high - energy gamma - ray band ( vhe , @xmath2gev ) in 1992 by the whipple collaboration @xcite",

    "the only noticeable asymmetry is that two thirds of the sources are located in the northern half of the sky . in the redshift distribution of vhe blazars ( see figure  [ fig : z ] ) most objects occur at @xmath3 , with the most distant known vhe source being 3c  279 at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the pair - production of vhe photons with uv to infrared photons from the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) limits the transparency window for gamma - rays at large redshifts .",
