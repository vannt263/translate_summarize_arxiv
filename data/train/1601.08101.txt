    "when a high intensity laser impinges on a solid density target a large part of the electromagnetic energy of the laser is converted into kinetic energy of fast moving electrons .",
    "the ponderomotive force of the laser accelerates electrons to relativistic energies and typically around 15% to 30% of the laser energy is converted @xcite while conversion rates up to 90% have been shown @xcite",
    ". these electrons can be useful for a number of different applications such as the fast ignition scheme for inertial confinement fusion @xcite , ion acceleration @xcite , or as a means to heat localised regions within the target @xcite . in the last of these applications",
    "the local hot spots can act as xuv radiation sources @xcite , as drivers for shock experiments @xcite or as drivers of jets in laboratory astrophysics experiments @xcite . in all cases there",
    "is a need to control the propagation of the fast electrons inside the solid density target",
    ".    one method of influencing the propagation of fast electrons is through magnetic fields , self generated at resistivity gradients @xcite .",
    "using a number of materials with different z to construct the target can generate multi kilotesla magnetic fields at the material interfaces @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields are strongly localised to a very narrow region around the interface , on a scale length comparable to the electron skin depth .",
    "these thin magnetic field layers reflect electrons that intercept the layer at sufficiently oblique angles .",
    "it has been shown that , for reasons of symmetry , the reflection is specular @xcite . because the motion of the electrons in the homogeneous domains can be assumed to be ballistic , one can apply the concepts of geometric mirror optics to the design of targets that guide and focus fast electrons .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate possible geometries for heating a small , well defined region within a solid density target . to this end ,",
    "the fast electrons that originate from the laser - plasma interaction region near the critical density surface need to be focused into a small volume .",
    "the fast electron current in this volume will draw a neutralising return current of cold background electrons in order to preserve global charge neutrality .",
    "this return current is responsible for depositing the fast electron energy into the target via ohmic heating .",
    "it is therefore the aim to concentrate the electrons as much as possible to create an optimal hot spot inside the target .    in order to understand the limitations of this endeavour , section [ secetendue ] will review the optical concept of etendue .",
    "the etendue is a conservation property that is linked to the liouville equation and provides a quantitative measure of how well a diffuse source can be collimated .",
    "it is linked to the source radius and its angular spread . in section [ secsimulations ]",
    "we will investigate the ability of specially designed targets to collimate electrons into a small region deep inside the target .",
    "the design of the targets is inspired by the concepts of non - imaging optics , specifically it will be a variant of a compound elliptical concentrator ( cec ) @xcite .",
    "simulations using the zephyros code @xcite will provide insight into electron transport and heating inside these targets .",
    "the predictions of the theory presented in section [ secetendue ] will be compared with the results of the simulation .",
    "section [ secresults ] will summarise the results and present the conclusions .",
    "in this section we will provide a short introduction of the concept of etendue and maximum concentration in optics . the specular reflection of fast electrons at material interfaces and the ballistic motion inside the homogeneous domains allows us to treat the fast electron trajectories the same way as light rays in geometric optics .",
    "specifically we can apply the same fundamental conservation laws to the electron dynamics .",
    "the etendue of a source which is extended over a small surface area @xmath1 with rays confined to a small solid angle @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angle that the rays make with the normal to the surface element and @xmath5 is the refractive index of the medium .",
    "when translating the etendue concept to fast electron motion , the notion of a refractive index loses its meaning .",
    "the deflection of an electron as it passes through a magnetic field layer does not obey snell s law .",
    "we will therefore be limiting ourselves to a single material and the specular reflections of electrons at the magnetic field layers .",
    "this implies that we can set the refractive index to @xmath6 and omit it from the calculation .",
    "given a finite sized circular source @xmath7 with radius @xmath8 emitting rays with an angular spread of opening angle @xmath9 , the total etendue of the source is @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the solid angle of the cone with half angle @xmath9 .",
    "one can show directly from liouville s theorem that the etendue of a bundle of rays is a conserved quantity .",
    "this means that , given a second circular surface @xmath12 with radius @xmath13 , and assuming that all rays from the source pass through @xmath12 then @xmath14 , or @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the cone half angle of the rays passing through @xmath12 .",
    "the maximum value that the angle of a bundle of forward going rays can assume is @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to a minimum value of @xmath13 or a maximum concentration , @xmath18 the product @xmath19 is a measure of how well a bundle of rays can be collected and directly gives the minimum radius of a disk that this bundle can be focused onto .",
    "in general the angular spread of fast electrons will depend on many parameters , such as the laser intensity or the laser contrast ratio .",
    "green et al @xcite compared experimental data with other results published in the literature and concluded that the angular spread increases with laser intensity .",
    "this means that , assuming a fixed power of the laser beam , the angular spread of fast electrons increases as the beam radius decreases .",
    "thus , the beam radius and the angular spread are competing factors in an attempt to minimise @xmath20 and it is not a priori clear whether a small spot size coupled with a large angular spread is better than a large spot size coupled with a small angular spread . in order to make a prediction we use a crude fit to the data presented by green et al @xcite , @xmath21 this formula is based on intensities in the range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "it should be emphasised that the form above is only a rough approximation to a small data set .",
    "we use it here merely to derive an approximate functional dependence of @xmath20 on the spot radius @xmath8 . for fixed beam power @xmath24 the average intensity over a circular disk is @xmath25 this relation allows us to express @xmath9 , and therefore @xmath20 , purely as a function of the beam radius .",
    ", between @xmath26 and @xmath23.,width=377 ]    figure [ figrminvsr ] shows the dependence of @xmath20 on the beam radius @xmath8 for various powers .",
    "one can see that , due to the logarithmic dependence of @xmath9 on the intensity , the advantage of decreasing the spot radius outweighs the disadvantage of an increasing angular spread of fast electrons .",
    "the minimum achievable focusing radius increases with the power of the incident laser , as is to be expected .",
    "in addition , @xmath20 also increases with @xmath8 despite the fact that that angular spread decreases . for smaller values of @xmath24 the curves plotted in figure [ figrminvsr ] stop at some maximum value of @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to the radius at which the intensity drops below @xmath26 , below which equation [ eqthetaapprox ] loses its justification .",
    "although the curves seem to flatten towards this point , we expect the value of @xmath20 to steadily increase with @xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for low intensities the value of @xmath9 will not fall below a finite positive lower bound .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath27 is also bounded from below implying that @xmath19 will grow with @xmath8 .",
    "the results of this section seem to imply that it is always favourable to focus the laser spot to the smallest radius possible .",
    "this will result in a point linke source of fast electrons with a large angular spread .",
    "given that the @xmath9 is less than @xmath28 the value of @xmath20 will be below @xmath8 which means that the electrons can be guided into a region even smaller than the laser spot size where they can rapidly heat the target .",
    "it should be pointed out that the values of @xmath20 presented here impose a theoretical lower limit to the size of the heated structure . whether this limit can be achieved in a concrete experiment design",
    "will depend on other factors . as we will see in the next section",
    ", the losses of fast electrons through the magnetic field layer play an important role in designing the optimal target geometry .",
    "these losses are not included in the calculations above in which we assumed perfectly reflecting interfaces .",
    "in order to evaluate the theoretical calculations we performed simulations of the electron transport in structured targets .",
    "in contrast to imaging optics , a non - imaging component does not need to map each point on some object plane uniquely onto a point on an image plane . instead",
    ", different rays from a single point on the source may end up on different points on a receiver , depending on their path . while designing an ideal concentrator using imaging optics",
    "is highly impractical , using non - imaging optics the task is greatly simplified .",
    "various methods are used to design non - imaging components @xcite . in the _ edge ray approach _ limiting rays originating from the edges of the source are considered and the design is chosen so that these rays hit the edges of the receiver .",
    "geometric arguments are used to prove that rays emerging from between the edges of the source will end up between the edges of the receiver . the _ flow line approach _",
    ", on the other hand , is more general and uses the description of the hamiltonian flow in 6 dimensional space .",
    "the most common designs resulting from these methods are the compound parabolic concentrator ( cpc ) and the compound elliptical concentrator ( cec ) . in these designs",
    "a section of a parabola or ellipse is rotated around the optical axis to create a reflecting surface . here the symmetry axis of the parabola or ellipse is not identical to the axis of rotation and , in general , does not have to be aligned with it . while cpcs are used for infinitely distant sources ( parallel rays ) , cecs are used for finite sized diffuse sources .    in our simulations we used a variant of a cec .",
    "the geometry of the collector is shown in figure [ figconcentrator ] .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the 3d particle hybrid code zephyros @xcite . in all simulations presented here",
    "the bulk of the target consists of ch while the plug that acts as the collector is made from carbon .",
    "the radius of the plug at the target front surface is @xmath8 and the small radius inside the target is @xmath29 where the end surface is located .",
    "the sides of the plug are defined by a section of an ellipse that is shifted down along the @xmath30axis by the small radius @xmath29 , denoted by the red curve in figure [ figconcentrator ] , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the depth of the plug and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the semi - major and the semi - minor axes respectively .",
    "the centre @xmath35 of the ellipse lies on the front surface and the semi - minor axis has a radius of @xmath36 .",
    "the semi - major axis is chosen such that the ellipse passes through the point @xmath37 , @xmath38 this section is then rotated around the @xmath39axis to create the rotationally symmetric collector .",
    "note that typical cec geometries prescribe the locations of the focal points in order to optimise the number of rays collected onto the end surface .",
    "here we do not impose such a restriction due to a number of other constraints imposed by the nature of the fast electron transport .",
    "firstly we do nt expect the fast electrons to travel arbitrary distances inside the solid density target before losing their energy .",
    "this means that we want to retain the depth @xmath32 as one of the free parameters .",
    "fixing the focal points implies that @xmath32 is a function of @xmath29 and @xmath8 and can not be chosen freely .",
    "secondly our geometry ensures that the ellipse intersects the front surface of the target at a right angle .",
    "this minimises the losses of fast electrons through the material interface .",
    ".overview of the parameters of the zephyros simulation runs . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we performed two sets of runs , each with fixed power but varying laser spot sizes .",

    "the return current carried by the background electrons neutralises the fast electron current and causes ohmic heating . using this mechanism it is possible to control the heating profile inside the target .",

    "we have shown that this geometry allows the energy density deposited to increase at some finite depth inside the target .",
    "a factor of 1.6 of the peak ion temperature ratio to the ion temperature at the front surface has been demonstrated with the peak temperature lying roughly @xmath90 m into the target .",
    "the results of the simulations indicate that there is an optimal range for the intensity of the laser beam for focusing fast electrons deep inside the target .",
    "electrons originating from relatively low intensity beams with large spot size and small angular divergence can create a heated region inside the target with a global temperature maximum . at first glance",
    ", this seems to be in contradiction to the calculations presented is section [ secetendue ] .",
    "these calculations revise the etendue concept of non - imaging optics in the context of fast electron transport .",
    "they predict that small sources of fast electrons with large angular spread result in better focusability than large sources with small angular spread resulting from a laser beam with the same total power .",
    "the calculations do nt take into account any losses of electrons .",
    "the conclusion is that the etendue must be seen as a theoretical limit to the focusability of the fast electron beam but can not be taken as a prediction for the actual heating profile .",
    "the discrepancy between the simulations and the predictions of section [ secetendue ] is mainly due to electron loss through the magnetic field layers .",
    "a small spot size implies a large intensity and this results in a large angular divergence of the fast electrons together with a high average kinetic energy .",
    "high energy electrons that impinge on the magnetic field layer at large angles are not effectively reflected due to their increased larmor radius .",
    "these electrons are lost through the boundaries of the collector geometry , reducing the heating further into the target .",
