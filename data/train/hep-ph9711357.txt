    "if low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is realised in nature it should show up at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "strongly interacting particles as gluinos and squarks will be most likely the first susy particles to be seen at lhc .",
    "gluinos of mass less than @xmath20 tev and squarks of mass less than @xmath21 tev [ 1 - 3 ] can be detected , covering in such a way the whole theoretically motivated parameter space .",
    "lhc is also a good laboratory for the search of electro - weakly interacting particles , e.g. sleptons [ 4,5 ] . in a recent paper [ 6 ] it was shown within the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) [ 7 ] model that sleptons in the mass range of @xmath22 to 400 gev can be detected at lhc by investigating the signature @xmath23 .",
    "however , this final state where direct production ( drell - yan ) of sleptons predominates requires high luminosity , @xmath24 .",
    "sleptons can be also produced indirectly in the decays of charginos and neutralinos , especially in @xmath25 decays .",
    "the charginos and neutralinos , can in turn be produced directly or come from gluinos and/or squarks .",
    "this leads to final states with @xmath26 . actually , this indirect slepton production through @xmath27 decays has the largest cross - section in a sizable region of the parameter space accessible at lhc and could allow sleptons to be already revealed at @xmath28 , i.e. simultaneously with strongly interacting sparticles .",
    "thus , indirect production of sleptons can be more important for observing a slepton signal than direct one [ 8 ] .",
    "moreover , in such a way the mass reach for sleptons search can be extended up to @xmath29 740 gev .",
    "having evidence for susy at lhc , one of the next tasks will be to find out the underlying model and to determine the model parameters . in this paper",
    "we work out a method to determine susy parameters and suggest a strategy for getting information on masses of susy particles by means of the signature @xmath30 .",
    "our study is made within the framework of the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) [ 7 ] . in this model",
    "all scalar particles ( sfermions and higgs bosons ) have a common mass @xmath2 at @xmath31  gev .",
    "the gaugino masses @xmath32 ( corresponding to u(1 ) , su(2 ) , and su(3 ) , respectively ) unify to a common gaugino mass @xmath3 , and all trilinear coupling parameters @xmath33 have the same value @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "one also has unification of the electroweak and strong coupling parameters @xmath36 [ 9 ] .",
    "a further reduction of the parameters is given by invoking radiative symmetry breaking. as a consequence , one has only the following input parameters : @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and @xmath39 is the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "the whole susy particle spectrum can then be calculated by making use of renormalization group equations ( rge ) .",
    "this model is also incorporated in the monte ",
    "carlo generator isasusy [ 10 ] which is used in our analysis .",
    "this paper is aimed at determining the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 with fixed @xmath40 . knowing these parameters",
    ", we can calculate the masses of the superpartners using rge . for this purpose",
    ", we study in detail the leptonic decays of @xmath41 which have some useful features . within the msugra model",
    ", @xmath41 has two - body decays , @xmath42 , in the region @xmath43 of the parameter space , whereas in the region @xmath44 , @xmath45 gev the @xmath41 has three - body decays , @xmath46 . in both regions the invariant dilepton mass spectrum ( @xmath47 ) has a maximum @xmath48 , and therefore a pronounced structure with a sharp edge can be seen at the kinematical endpoint .",
    "this property was discussed first in ref . [",
    "11 ] in the case of three - body decays of @xmath41 and then in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] in the case of two - body decays .",
    "the generality of this feature , i.e. the observability of an edge in the @xmath47 spectrum even in inclusive @xmath49 and @xmath50 final states in a large part of the parameter space was shown in [ 13 ]",
    ". we will show how much the parameters are constrained by a measurement of the @xmath48 value of the dilepton mass spectra .",
    "moreover , we will discuss a method , based on the analysis of the @xmath47 spectrum , to find out whether the observed edge is due to the two - body or three - body decays of @xmath41 .",
    "within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the masses of the neutralinos are determined by the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 using @xmath52 ( @xmath53 being the u(1 ) gaugino mass ) . in the following , we fix @xmath54 ( we assume that @xmath40 could be known from previous experiments ) and",
    "take @xmath55 . in msugra",
    "@xmath56 quite generally turns out to be @xmath57 , so that in this case @xmath58 .",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath41 are gaugino like , @xmath59 is almost a pure @xmath60 , and @xmath41 almost a pure @xmath61 . in supergravity",
    "the slepton masses are given by [ 14 ] :    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    analogous equations exist for squarks [ 14 ] .",
    "therefore , when the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are known we can calculate all sparticle masses . a special case is the third generation of squarks and sleptons , where l@xmath67r mixing plays a crucial rle .",
    "neutralinos @xmath41 can be produced at the lhc through a drell - yan mechanism ( direct production ) , in association with strongly interacting sparticles , or in the decay chain of gluinos and squarks ( indirect production ) .",
    "gluino and squark pair production processes are the dominant source of @xmath41 s because of large strong interaction cross - sections .",
    "the branching ratios of gluino and squark decays into @xmath41 are also sizable and are shown in fig.1 as a function of the model parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one can see that the regions in ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) plane where the decays @xmath68 and @xmath69 are open , are complementary . in the region",
    "@xmath70 gluinos are lighter than squarks and can decay into @xmath41 , while squarks prefer to decay into gluinos . in the region",
    "@xmath71 squarks are lighter than gluinos and can decay into @xmath41 , but gluinos decay into squarks .",
    "hence the decays @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) can coexist ( see also fig.1 ) .",
    "fig.2(a , b ) shows @xmath74 for indirect @xmath41 production from gluinos and squarks as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "there are three different leptonic decays of @xmath41 interesting for our study : @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "when decays of @xmath41 to sleptons are allowed , sleptons decay directly into the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp@xmath78 ) with br(@xmath79 .",
    "branching ratios of @xmath41 decays into leptons directly and via sleptons are shown in fig.3 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the regions where these decays are kinematically allowed are complementary in the parameter plane , depending on whether @xmath41 is lighter or heavier than @xmath10 .",
    "thus , one can distinguish three domains in the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) plane , which are ( also see fig.4 ) :    domain ii ( @xmath80 @xmath81 = @xmath82 = @xmath67 = @xmath83    domain i ( @xmath84 @xmath85    @xmath86 with @xmath87 +   + domain ii ( @xmath88    @xmath81 @xmath89 @xmath86 with @xmath90 +   + domain iii ( @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath86 with @xmath93 +    in domain iii , the decay @xmath94 would also be kinematically allowed , but since the @xmath60 component of @xmath41 is very small , the coupling to @xmath95 is also small .",
    "therefore , the decay @xmath96 is very much suppressed in the whole domain .    in fig.5",
    "we show the regions for @xmath97 and 0.1 pb , @xmath98 , 0.1 pb and @xmath99 , 0.002 pb in the ( @xmath100 ) plane from indirect and associated @xmath41 production followed by decays to @xmath101 final states directly or via sleptons . one can see that there are regions in domains ii and iii where the mentioned decays coexist .",
    "finally , in fig.6 we show @xmath74 for indirect and associated production of @xmath41 decaying into leptons directly or via sleptons .",
    "in order to determine the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 we will exploit in the following the kinematical features of the two- and three - body leptonic decays of @xmath41 .    as pointed out in",
    "[ 11 ] , the decay @xmath103 ( domain i ) has the useful kinematical property that the invariant mass of the two leptons @xmath47 has a maximum at    @xmath104    whereas for the decays @xmath105 ( domain ii and iii ) the maximum of @xmath47 is given by [ 12 ] :    @xmath106    thus , the @xmath47 distribution has a very characteristic shape with a sharp edge at the kinematical endpoint @xmath107 .",
    "as the main source of @xmath41 s is their indirect production in gluino and squark decays , the most suitable signature for selecting the @xmath6 decays is provided by the topology with two same  flavour opposite  sign leptons accompanied by large missing transverse energy and usually accompanied by a high multiplicity of jets . in this paper",
    "we thus concentrate on the @xmath108@xmath109@xmath110 channel , where the final state leptons are electrons and muons .",
    "the simulations are done at the particle level , with parametrised detector responses based on detailed detector simulations .",
    "these parametrisations are adequate for the level of detector properties we want to investigate , and are the only practical ones in view of the multiplicity and complexity of the final state signal and background channels investigated .",
    "the essential ingredients for the investigation of susy channels are the response to jets , @xmath111 , the lepton identification and isolation capabilities of the detector , and the capability to tag b - jets .",
    "the cms detector simulation program cmsjet 3.2 [ 15 ] is used .",
    "it incorporates the full electro - magnetic ( ecal ) and hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeter granularity , and includes main calorimeter system cracks in rapidity and azimuth .",
    "the energy resolutions for muons , electrons ( photons ) , hadrons and jets are parametrised .",
    "transverse and longitudinal shower profiles are also included through appropriate parametrisations .",
    "the main detector features incorporated in the monte  carlo description are :    @xmath112 hadronic tracks , muons and electrons are measured up to @xmath113=2.4    @xmath112 deflection of charged particles due to the 4 t magnetic field is included .",
    "@xmath112 the resolution for the muon system is parametrised according to [ 16 ] .",
    "@xmath112 the calorimetric coverage goes up to at @xmath113=5 for the hcal and @xmath113=2.6 for the ecal .",
    "@xmath112 ecal energy resolution parametrized as :    @xmath114    @xmath112 hcal energy resolution is parametrised according to [ 17 ] as a function of @xmath115 ; a typical hadron resolution is :    @xmath116    @xmath112 energy resolution for very forward calorimeter ( vfcal ) , in the parallel plate chambers option :    @xmath117    @xmath112 granularity of calorimeters :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one should first notice that the observation of two edges at @xmath11 pb@xmath12 would determine the ( @xmath100 ) point uniquely .",
    "this is due to the fact that the set of the edge position values in the @xmath47 spectrum is different at each point of the parameter region ( _ case 1 _ ) , where two edges are expected to be observed at @xmath118 pb@xmath12 , see figs.10 and 14 . with a luminosity @xmath119 pb@xmath12",
    "the positions of the two edges will fix two ( @xmath100 ) points , belonging to domains ii and iii and corresponding to _ case 1 _ and _ case 2 _ , respectively . at high",
    "luminosity , @xmath120 pb@xmath12 , the observation of two edges can give up to three possible ( @xmath100 ) points .",
    "one of them is from domain ii , corresponding to _ case 1_. the lines @xmath121 corresponding to @xmath122 decays have the form of an ellipse and can cross the @xmath121 lines corresponding to @xmath123 decays twice .",
    "hence , two points with the same set of edge positions in the @xmath47 spectrum can be found in domain iii corresponding to _ case 2_. a discrimination between these points is possible on basis of the event kinematics , and/or by an analysis of the total event rate and the relative number of events corresponding to the two peaks , ( see figs.5,10 - 12 )",
    ".      for a definite value of the edge position @xmath48 one expects a different shape of the @xmath47 distributions in two- and three - body decays ( see fig.13 , where the first peak is due to a two - body decay of @xmath41 and the second one due to a three - body decay ) .",
    "as we have seen from figs.7 and 8 the signal events contribute in the interval @xmath124 .",
    "in the following we only consider events in this mass region .",
    "the average value @xmath125@xmath47@xmath126 of signal and background events of this mass region is shown in fig.15 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the errors are calculated by taking into account the statistical error , a systematic error in the measurement of the edge position , and a systematic error of 30 @xmath127 for background uncertainty ( the main background is @xmath128 ) .",
    "one clearly sees that @xmath125@xmath47@xmath126 is significantly smaller in the case of a direct three - body decay @xmath129 .",
    "thus the shape of the dilepton mass spectrum already allows one to decide whether @xmath41 decays into a slepton or not .    in order to distinguish between domains ii and iii ,",
    "we suggest to use the fact that in general the contour lines with the same @xmath48 for right and left sleptons have no overlap in @xmath3 in regions of parameter space which are accessible at a given luminosity , see figs.9 and 14 as an example .",
    "it means that the masses of @xmath59 s are different for these two lines , and hence @xmath111 is expected to be different . in fig.16",
    "we show the @xmath125@xmath111@xmath126 values for events with @xmath130 decays after the cuts @xmath131 gev and @xmath132 gev , @xmath133 .",
    "the errors are calculated by taking into account the statistical error and a systematic error in the measurement of the edge position . as can be seen from fig.16 ,",
    "@xmath134@xmath111@xmath135 is larger in the case of @xmath136 than in the case of @xmath137 as expected .      when the correct @xmath48 line is chosen , the last step is to find the point ( @xmath100 ) on this line . in general",
    "the cross section falls with increasing @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we study the event rate along the corresponding @xmath48 line .",
    "we first discuss the domain iii , where the situation is simpler .",
    "for the event rate analysis at @xmath11 pb@xmath12 , to reduce the uncertainties due to background , we use a harder cut on @xmath111 , @xmath138 gev .",
    "the dependence of the expected event rate on @xmath2 is shown in fig.17 .",
    "the errors are calculated by taking into account the statistical error and a systematic error of 30 @xmath127 for background uncertainty . a systematic error due to the precision of the edge position measurement",
    "is also taken into account . from the observed event rate",
    "we can then determine @xmath2 with a good accuracy , @xmath139 gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is then given by the @xmath140line in the @xmath141 plane .",
    "the precision obtained in such a way is @xmath142 gev",
    ".    in domain ii , the event rate along a line of definite @xmath48 is first increasing and then decreasing with @xmath2 , see fig.18 .",
    "this is mainly due to the change in the branching ratios ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the dependence of the event rate is , however , such that @xmath2 can not be determined uniquely . to a given event rate there",
    "correspond in general two @xmath2 values .",
    "the ambiguity can , however , be solved at high luminosity @xmath120 pb@xmath12 , when two edges in the @xmath47 distribution can be observed .",
    "for domain i , the @xmath2 dependence of the event rate is shown in fig.19a , again for @xmath143 gev .",
    "notice the steep increase of the rate at @xmath144 gev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the decay channel @xmath129 is just opening in this region .",
    "as can be seen from the curve in fig.19a , there is an ambiguity in the determination of @xmath2 if the event rate is in the region @xmath145 or 120 gev @xmath146 240 gev . here",
    "it helps if we look at the average number of jets @xmath125@xmath147@xmath126 in the events under study .",
    "fig.19b shows @xmath125@xmath147@xmath126 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath125@xmath147@xmath126 is rising with @xmath2 as more jets are produced as the squarks become heavier . with the measured @xmath125@xmath147@xmath126",
    "we can resolve the ambiguity in the mentioned region 120 gev @xmath146 240 gev and thus determine @xmath2 with @xmath148 gev .",
    "in this paper we have performed a detailed analysis of events with the signature @xmath30 to be expected in pp collisions at lhc .",
    "our aim has been to determine the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the minimal supergravity model and to get information on the mass spectrum of susy particles , assuming knowledge of @xmath149 from previous experiments .",
    "we have exploited the property of the @xmath41 leptonic decays @xmath150 , @xmath151 that the invariant mass of the two final leptons has a maximum , @xmath48 , clearly visible even in inclusive production . we have determined for different luminosities the regions in the ( @xmath100 ) parameter plane where one or two edges can be observed in the invariant dilepton mass distributions .",
    "these regions already give preliminary information about the model parameters .",
    "the appearance of the edges in the @xmath47 distributions can be already seen with a luminosity @xmath11 pb@xmath12 .",
    "therefore we have concentrated on a low luminosity study . on the other hand , in case no such observation will be made at this luminosity , the corresponding parameter region can be excluded , and the same analysis can be done at higher luminosity .",
    "we have shown that a measurement of the @xmath48 value constrains the parameters mainly to three lines in the ( @xmath100 ) parameter plane .",
    "the lines correspond to the decay modes @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 respectively .",
    "we have worked out a method to discriminate the three - body from the two - body @xmath41 decays . in the case of three - body @xmath41 decays the parameter @xmath3 can be determined by the measured value of @xmath48 with a precision of @xmath155 gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 can then be determined from the observed event rate with a precision of 7 - 3 gev . in the case of two - body @xmath41",
    "decays , a measurement of the missing transverse energy can allow one to distinguish between the two possible decays @xmath156 and @xmath157 , but a more detailed study is needed . by an event rate analysis along the corresponding line in the ( @xmath100 ) plane",
    "we can determine @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath158 gev .",
    "knowing @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath149 , the masses of all susy particles ( except for the 3rd generation of squarks and sleptons ) are calculated by rge .",
    "the precisions which can be achieved are @xmath159 gev .",
    "in such a way it is possible to obtain information about susy particle masses already with low luminosity ( @xmath160 pb@xmath12 ) even without having direct experimental evidence for their existence . this is especially important for sleptons in a parameter region where high luminosity would be necessary to detect them through direct production .",
    "this study has been performed for @xmath161 , but it is also possible for high values of @xmath149 .",
    "most likely , for large @xmath162 a higher luminosity will be needed because of smaller branching ratios of the @xmath41 leptonic decays .",
    "let us mention some further interesting aspects of this work .",
    "selecting the two - body @xmath41 leptonic decays by our method represents an indirect evidence for sleptons in the framework of msugra .",
    "in this way it is possible to probe slepton masses up to @xmath163 gev well beyond what is possible in direct [ 5,6 ] searches .",
    "as it has been shown in this study , the edge in the invariant dilepton mass distributions is expected to appear at @xmath164 gev , being quite generally a signal for a two- or three - body decay of some abundantly produced heavy object .",
    "hence such an observation may serve as a first evidence for physics beyond the standard model , and if observed with significant @xmath111 it would be a clear evidence for susy , more specifically for @xmath41 production .",
