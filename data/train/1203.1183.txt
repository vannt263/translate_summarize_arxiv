    "the equivalence ( mutual absolute continuity ) of probability distributions of solutions to infinite - dimensional stochastic equations has been extensively studied for equations driven by wiener process and is of importance in the investigation of large - time behaviour and ergodicity of solutions ( see e.g. @xcite for early works on stochastic reaction - diffusion equations , the book @xcite , and the references therein ) . indeed , by doob s theorem and its improvements @xcite it enables proofs of strong ergodicity and mixing of the markov semigroups .    the first results in this direction for stochastic linear equations appeared in the pioneering monograph by da prato and zabczyk @xcite ( cf . also the earlier paper by j. zabczyk @xcite ) , where the following statement may be found .",

    "we extend the result of this paper by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of laws ( example 3.4 ) .",
    "this toy model shows the interesting ( but natural ) feature that smoother paths of the driving process ( i.e. a bigger hurst parameter ) require more restrictive conditions for equivalence of laws ( which , of course , is just the converse with respect to regularity problems ) .    in section [ sec:2 ] the first part of the paper we obtain an extension of the above - mentioned result from @xcite to the case of general gaussian noise .",
