    "the nature of dark energy in our universe remains unknown , and is likely to be the subject of intense observational attention over the coming decade @xcite .",
    "while a pure cosmological constant remains the simplest interpretation of present data , a leading alternative possibility is the quintessence paradigm , whereby the observed acceleration is driven by the potential energy of a single canonically - normalized scalar field @xcite ( for extensive reviews of dark energy see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we work under the assumption that quintessence is a valid description of observational data ( an assumption to be tested separately ) , and seek to impose optimal constraints on the model via exact numerical computation .",
    "our work provides an implementation of quintessence potential reconstruction , a subject developed by several authors @xcite , and by assuming a particular physical model for dark energy is distinct from parameterized equation of state methods for reconstructing dark energy .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we carried out a direct reconstruction of the quintessence potential based on the supernova type ia ( snia ) luminosity  redshift measurements made / collated by riess _",
    "et al . _",
    "the present paper updates and extends that work in three ways :    1 .",
    "we include additional data coming from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , as well as using newer supernova data from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite .",
    "we do not use constraints from the growth rate of structure , which are not yet competitive with the data we do use .",
    "2 .   where previously we approximated the quintessence potential via a taylor series , we now additionally explore use of pad approximant expansions in order to test robustness under choice of expansion .",
    "3 .   by studying the dynamical properties of models permitted by the data , we assess whether current observations favour or disfavour the hypothesis that the quintessence field is of tracker form , hence potentially addressing the coincidence problem .",
    "as we were completing this paper , a closely - related paper was submitted by huterer and peiris @xcite , who also reconstruct quintessence potentials from a similar compilation of current data .",
    "although phrased in the language of flow equations , their approach , like ours here and in ref .",
    "@xcite , amounts to fitting the coefficients of a taylor expansion of the potential .",
    "they do not consider pad approximants .",
    "their approach implies different priors for the parameters than the ones used in this paper , and they treat the scalar field velocity a little differently .",
    "our results appear in good agreement , in particular our determination that present data mildly favour tracker models over non - tracker models concurring with their conclusion that freezing models are mildly preferred to thawing ones ( in the terminology of ref .",
    "we quickly review the set - up of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is conceptually straightforward .",
    "we assume that the quintessence field @xmath0 has a potential @xmath1 , which we expand in a series about the present value of the field that is taken ( without loss of generality ) to be zero .",
    "the quintessence field obeys the equation @xmath2 with the hubble parameter @xmath3 given by the friedmann equation @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the matter density and @xmath6 the quintessence density .",
    "we assume spatial flatness throughout ( as motivated by cmb measurements and the inflationary paradigm ) , though the generalization to the non - flat case would be straightforward .",
    "since then @xmath7 we have the present boundary condition @xmath8 } \\,,\\ ] ] where subscript ` 0 ' indicates present value , and @xmath9 is the critical density . an important quantity , which determines the cosmological effects we consider from the quintessence field , is the equation of state @xmath10 the priors we assume for our cosmology are @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fraction of critical energy density in field kinetic energy density .",
    "the last condition is a means of encoding that the field should not interfere too much with structure formation ( as we do not use data sensitive to that ) , and is discussed further in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath13 is in practice applied up to the highest redshift for which we have data points , i.e.  using cmb information @xmath14 .",
    "when we use supernova data only , the upper limit is @xmath15 , as in our previous study .      to explore the space of potentials",
    ", we need to assume some functional form for the potential .",
    "we choose two classes of expansions , a taylor series , and a pad series , to parameterize the potential function @xmath1 . in the absence of a theoretical bias for the functional form of the potential ,",
    "these expansions seem suitably general and simple to provide a reasonably fair sampling of the space of potential functions .      as in our previous study",
    ", we use a taylor series to model the potential @xmath1 as @xmath16 where @xmath0 is in units of the reduced planck mass @xmath17 with @xmath0 presently zero .",
    "we will refer to a constant potential with non - zero kinetic energy allowed as a _ skater _ model , after linder in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we put the following flat priors on the parameters : @xmath18 these priors are irrelevant for parameter estimation , as they are significantly broader than the high - likelihood region ( this also applies to the corresponding priors for pad series below ) .",
    "however , to assess how favoured tracker behaviour is , we do need to put some limits , so that we can sample a finite region of the prior parameter space ( see further in section  [ sect : trvsnontr ] ) .",
    "in addition to the taylor series expansion , in this paper we also use pad approximant expansions in order to test the robustness of results to the method used .",
    "pad approximants are rational functions of the form @xmath19 that can be used to approximate functions .",
    "these approximants typically have better - behaved asymptotics , i.e.  stay closer to the approximated function , than taylor expansions because of their rational structure .",
    "an extensive expos on pad approximants can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for our study",
    ", we will assume @xmath20 where again @xmath0 is in units of @xmath17 with @xmath0 presently zero .",
    "specifically , we use pad series @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as these form an exhaustive set of lowest order and next - to - lowest order non - trivial expansions with two or three parameters .",
    "higher orders are unmotivated given the known difficulty for data to constrain more than two dark energy / quintessence evolution parameters @xcite ( as will also be evident from our results ) .",
    "pad series have poles , but , as will be discussed in the results section , data constrains models so that the presence of poles is not felt .    to enable comparison between our results for the two different parameterization classes , the priors for the pad series case",
    "are set by evaluating the maclaurin expansion of the pad series , identifying the order coefficients , and using the taylor - series priors for those , i.e. @xmath24 this does not limit us to a finite region , so we additionally require @xmath25 .",
    "cosmological tracker potentials / solutions have been studied in detail by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "these potentials are such that the late - time evolution of the field can be essentially independent of initial conditions , thus providing a possible solution to the coincidence problem .",
    "this behaviour is achieved through a type of dynamical attractor solution , and the conditions for it to be possible given a particular potential have been given and studied in detail by steinhardt _",
    "_ @xcite . defining @xmath26 , where prime denotes a derivative with respect to the field",
    ", the two sufficient conditions for a potential to possess a tracker solution are @xmath27 the first of these conditions ensures convergence to the tracker solution ( i.e.  perturbations away from it are suppressed ) , and the second ensures an adiabatic evolution of the field that is necessary for the first condition to be applicable ( and is what one would expect of a function that is to maintain a dynamical attractor independent of initial conditions ) .",
    "if these conditions are fulfilled , the field will eventually approach the tracker solution ( unless the initial quintessence energy density is too low ) , and the equation of state will then evolve according to @xmath28 possibly breaking away from the tracker solution if either of the conditions later become violated . in assessing whether tracking is taking place",
    ", one also has to check whether the actual evolution on the tracker potential corresponds closely to the tracker solution .",
    "an illustration of tracker behaviour can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : trackex ] .",
    "we additionally impose the condition @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the background energy density .",
    "this is to ensure a possible solution of the coincidence problem by having the dark energy density grow with respect to the matter .",
    "this third condition is usually avoided by specifying the tracker condition as @xmath31 rather than eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammareq ] ) .",
    "the reason for not choosing @xmath31 as our condition is related to our numerical treatment , and is discussed further in section  [ sect : identtrack ] .    as we need a non - zero second derivative of the potential with respect to the field for @xmath32 to fulfil the tracker conditions , we restrict ourselves to the quadratic potential and the pad series for the tracker viability analysis .    ) for a tracker potential .",
    "the oscillating curves correspond to higher ( solid ) and slightly lower ( dash - dotted ) initial conditions at high redshift for @xmath33 compared to the tracker solution value .",
    "the initial velocity at high redshift is assumed to be zero .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations in @xmath34 around the tracker solution ( thin - dashed curve originating at @xmath35 ) decays exponentially with decreasing @xmath36 , and the evolution thus approaches the tracker solution regardless of the different initial conditions .",
    "although not directly corresponding to our models , the figure illustrates qualitatively the tracker property . reproduced from ref .",

    "the observed magnitudes ( indexed by @xmath51 ) are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the rest - frame b - band magnitude at maximum b - band luminosity , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the shape and color parameters .",
    "these are derived from the light - curve fits and are reported by the snls team .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are free parameters and should be varied in cosmological fits . however , as they are independent of cosmology @xcite , we fix them to the snls best - fit values @xmath58 without introducing any bias , and include their uncertainty in the magnitude uncertainties we use .    for comparison to our previous paper where the parameter @xmath59 is used , the parameter @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the estimate of intrinsic supernova magnitude in riess _",

    "the cmb peak - shift parameter @xcite @xmath62 measures an overall linear shift of the cmb power spectrum in multipole space , induced by the effect @xmath63 has on the angular - diameter distance to the surface of last scattering at @xmath64 .",
    "the position of the first power spectrum peak is essentially a measure of this distance .",
    "we use the recent wmap3 data @xcite as analyzed by wang and mukherjee @xcite , who found @xmath65      the standard big bang scenario predicts that close to the surface of last scattering , baryons and photons act as a fluid with acoustic oscillations from the competition between gravitational attraction and radiation pressure . as the photons decouple , these acoustic oscillations should be frozen in the baryon and dark matter distributions .",

    "overall , we have 115(snia)+1(cmb)+1(bao ) data points .",
    "separate from the question of parameter estimation is the question of parameter necessity , i.e. model selection .",

    "we are only addressing the question whether the ( essentially late - time ) evolution of quintessence is more consistent with such a class of tracker potentials , or with a class that does not have such behaviour . as the shape of the potential at high redshifts is almost unconstrained by data",

    "an interesting feature of the new dataset is that it much more strongly disfavours a quadratic potential over the other taylor expansions than just the riess _",

    "the best - fit cosmologies ( figs .",
    "[ fig : vphi ] and [ fig : omegaphi ] ) now show more convergence in their dynamical properties , although still exhibiting increasing variation with redshift . in particular , we find that where previously the evolution of @xmath63 for the best - fit quadratic potential was such that @xmath63 stayed between @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) , the evolution is now very reasonable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : omegaphi ] ) .",

    "all best - fit models fall into the ` freezing ' category of caldwell and linder @xcite . for the skater model this behaviour is built - in , but it is somewhat intriguing in terms of naturalness that the best - fit linear potential exhibits freezing while at the same time rolling downhill ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : vz ] and [ fig : wphi ] ) .",
    "the potentials with curvature incorporate this best - fit behaviour by making the field reach the potential minimum in the recent past ( around @xmath112 to @xmath113 ) , thus providing a braking force to precipitate the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this situation would appear somewhat more natural from a dynamical point of view , and it could be that the best - fit linear potential is trying to approximate this , though data is unable to sufficiently constrain the models with curvature in the potential . on the other hand , model selection using the bic",
    "also strongly disfavours these models",
    ". the conclusion must be that complementary or better - quality data is needed to resolve this possible contradiction .",
    "if the linear - potential results stand up , they will put the well - motivated models of quintessence based on pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) @xcite and similar models under pressure , as these rely on a thawing field that is becoming dynamical and cosmologically dominant in the present epoch . however a field just passing the potential minimum fits well with the pngb picture , as well as other tracker - type potentials that show a cross - over behaviour , such as the sugra @xcite and albrecht ",
    "skordis @xcite potentials where the field is starting to feel a curvature in the potential at late times .",
    "these models exhibit early quintessence @xcite , and can thus be constrained using big bang nucleosynthesis and cmb observations @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see what future data , including those sensitive to perturbation growth and supernovae , can tell .",
    "these observations are in line with studies by e.g.  bludman @xcite and linder @xcite , who both conclude that quintessence generically can not be described by slow - roll , and that tracking must break down and move towards slow - roll in the recent past ( begging the question why this is happening precisely now ) .      in carrying out the tracker viability analysis , we consider four implementations in all by combining two choices of conditions .",
    "the first is to demand either that the field remains in the tracker regime until the present , or that it is allowed to break out of tracking after a redshift of @xmath113 .",
    "the second is to consider two different upper limits for the redshift range where the field is required to be in the tracker regime , namely @xmath15 and @xmath114 ; the former more or less represents where the data actually lie , while the latter extrapolates the potential to higher redshifts .",
    "we find that all four cases give qualitatively the same outcome , and so focus on just one choice , where tracking is imposed between @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",

    "we are then in a position to do _ importance sampling _",
    "( see e.g.  appendix b in ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief introduction ) using the prior and posterior we have calculated .",
    "we can change priors for @xmath153 from those induced by @xmath72 to whichever we like and obtain the corresponding new posterior distribution , since we only need to divide out the prior distribution and multiply by the prior of our choice ( with the exception of parts of parameter space cut out by the primary prior @xmath72 or very poorly sampled ) .",
    "a potential problem with this approach is that optimal sampling of the posterior distribution in @xmath153 is not necessarily achieved by optimal sampling in the primary parameters , and sufficient statistics may take a long time , i.e. many chain elements , to accumulate .    setting natural priors for these new parameters",
    "may be perceived as difficult ( although not manifestly more arbitrary than for other phenomenological parameterizations ) .",
    "a simple way of setting the priors is to argue that we should be equally likely to draw a parameter value that fulfils the corresponding tracker criterion , as one that does nt . for instance , if we assume gaussian priors , we get @xmath154 \\ , , \\\\ p(c_2 ) & = & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{c_2 } } \\exp \\left [    -\\frac{c_2 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2_{c_2 } } \\right ] \\theta(c_2)\\ , , \\\\",
    "p(c_3 ) & = & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{c_3 } } \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{c_3 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2_{c_3 } } \\right ] \\theta(c_3 ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the heaviside step function ( @xmath121 and @xmath150 are restricted to non - negative values by definition ) . the standard deviations @xmath156 and @xmath157 are set by then demanding @xmath158 the case of @xmath120 is different , since we only have one inequality to fulfil ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "hence , we need to put a cut - off at some value to determine the standard deviation .",
    "one could of course assign , for example , flat priors in the same fashion .    using this method",
    ", we can thus obtain a posterior distribution @xmath160 for a given prior distribution @xmath161 of our choice , thus allowing a removal of correlation biases intrinsic to particular parameterizations , which should reduce model uncertainty .",
    "this method allows us to perform parameter estimation on @xmath153 as well as model selection by calculating the bayesian evidence .",
    "it is of course applicable to general dynamical cosmological properties one might wish to study . carrying this out in practice",
    "can however be involved since we might not be sampling efficiently in the mcmc , and performing model selection in a robust manner would require specialized code to address the sampling inefficiency and to handle the use of a binned distribution .        v. sahni and a. a. starobinsky , int . j. mod",
