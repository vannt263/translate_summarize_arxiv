    "strong numerical evidence was found for a change of the bulk - spin autocorrelation function at @xmath5  from gaussian decay to exponential decay for the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 increasing from @xmath6 and from exponential decay to power - law decay as @xmath7 approaches 1 , then replaced by a more rapid decay upon further increase of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the equivalent - neighbor xxz model was studied in much detail at @xmath8 and @xmath5 using different calculational techniques , and was found the same long - time asymptotic behavior for the correlation function @xcite .",
    "more efforts have been concentrated on the dynamics of random quantum spin systems in the past decades which can be used for describing more real materials such as ferroelectric crystals @xcite and spin glasses @xcite .",
    "florencio and barreto _ _  _ _ have _ _  _ _ studied the random transverse  ising model and obtained that the system undergoes a crossover between a collective - mode behavior and a central - peak one while the exchange couplings or external fields satisfy the bimodal distribution @xcite .",
    "later , the dynamics of the four - body transverse ising model has been investigated for the cases of bond and field randomness @xcite ,  following which , a series of spin systems such as the xy model with zero magnetic , the transverse ising model with gaussian distribution and two - dimensional transverse ising model etc .  have also been studied @xcite .",

    "the spin autocorrelation function for @xmath75 decays monotonically to 0 and the spectral density is now peaked at @xmath81 so , the system is at the central - peak regime where the dynamics is mostly dominated by the exchange coupling . by comparing the curve for @xmath75 in figs .",

    "@xcite . by comparing the results when @xmath7 @xmath85 to that of the 1-d xy model",

    "the competition between the spin - spin interactions and the external fields becomes very fierce  which drives the system to be disordered .      in the case ,",
    "the external fields satisfy the gaussian distribution,@xmath87 ,   \\label{9}\\]]where @xmath88 is the mean value of the external fields , @xmath89 is the standard deviation . here",

    "3 for @xmath96 and fig . 4 for @xmath97    figure 3(a1 ) shows that when the standard deviation is small @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the system shows two types of dynamics as @xmath88 increases : the central - peak behavior and the collective - mode behavior . in this case , the effect of @xmath0 can be ignored basically , the dynamics of the system changes according to the concentration of @xmath100 as @xmath0 increases from @xmath71 to @xmath10 , a disordered behavior replaces the central - peak behavior or the collective - mode behavior .",
    "3(a2 ) , ( b2 ) and ( c2 ) also show that the effects of the external fields are to urge the system to show a crossover when @xmath99 and as @xmath0 increases to 1.0 , the system displays a disordered behavior .    when the standard deviation is large enough @xmath101[see fig .",
    "4 ] , the system just shows a disordered behavior which is something in between the central - peak behavior and the collective - mode one regardless of the anisotropy parameter . from fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 , it is not difficult to see that both the crossover and disordered behavior are replaced by one disordered behavior with the increase of @xmath102  this is because the value of the external field is large and the value range is wide  when @xmath103 .",
    "the large external fields drive the spin orientation of the system to be disordered .",
    "double - gaussian distribution is a common form of bimodal distribution and gaussian distribution , which can be used to describe both discrete distribution and continuous one,@xmath104 + \\left ( 1-p\\right ) \\frac{1}{% \\sqrt{2\\pi } \\sigma _ { b}}\\exp \\left [ -\\left ( b_{i}-b_{2}\\right ) ^{2}/2\\sigma _ { b}^{2}\\right ] ,   \\label{10}\\]]where @xmath105 represents the concentration of @xmath84 that satisfies the gaussian distribution .",

    "the figures indicate that when @xmath96 , the system for @xmath99 shows a crossover between a central - peak behavior and a collective - mode one , and a disordered behavior as @xmath0 increases to @xmath10 .",
    "however , the system only shows a disordered behavior when @xmath112 , no matter what @xmath7 takes .    from above discussion , we can see that the dynamical behavior of the system is affected by the competition between the spin - spin interactions and the external fields , not by the different disordered distribution",
    "also , it is easy to find that the dynamics of the system is similar to that of the 1-d quantum xy model @xcite when  @xmath0 is small ( e.g. , @xmath113 ) . when @xmath114 the xxz model becomes the isotropy xy model .",
