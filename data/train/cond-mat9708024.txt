    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) gives a schematic description of very important systems with strongly correlated electrons , and there are several recent reviews on this subject @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a lattice with two localized electronic states at each site , strongly correlated by a coulomb repulsion @xmath2 , plus a band of uncorrelated conduction electrons ( c - electrons ) that hybridize with the localized electrons ( f - electrons ) .",
    "the cumulant expansion of the pam discussed in this work is a perturbative expansion around the atomic limit , and is an extension@xcite of the method originally employed by hubbard @xcite to study his well known model of correlated itinerant electrons@xcite .",
    "he introduced operators @xmath3 that transform the local state @xmath4 at site @xmath5 into the local state @xmath6 at the same site , and developed a diagrammatic method that circumvents the fact that the @xmath7 operators are neither fermions nor bosons .",
    "his work was the first application of the cumulant expansion to a quantum system of fermions@xcite and has several desirable properties : it seems to be a natural extension of the usual diagrammatic techniques , it does not have excluded site problems in the lattice summations and it is possible to derive a linked cluster expansion for the grand canonical potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . at the same time",
    ", the use of @xmath7 operators allows to work in a subspace of the whole space of local states , that contains only the states that are relevant to the problem of interest .",
    "it seems therefore useful to understand better this method , and the main purpose of the present paper is to study the properties of the cumulant expansion for the pam in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "metzner and vollhardt@xcite have recently applied the limit @xmath8 to strongly correlated fermion systems , providing non - trivial models of the hubbard type that are substantially simpler to analyze .",
    "this development has stimulated many new works , and we could mentioned the very successful dynamical mean field theory@xcite , that uses the local properties of the self energy for @xmath9 as a starting point .",
    "several methods have been employed to study the pam in this limit@xcite , and the cumulant expansion of the hubbard model was reconsidered by metzner@xcite , showing that there is an important reduction in the number and type of cumulant diagrams that appear in the expansion when @xmath9 in an hypercubic lattice . in the hubbard model there is no hybridization and the hopping hamiltonian is used as perturbation , while the pam is usually employed to model systems with a bandwidth much larger than the hybridization energies , and it is then preferable to diagonalize the conduction band and use the hybridization hamiltonian as perturbation .",
    "it was then necessary to make substantial modifications to metzner s derivation in order to apply it to the pam when @xmath9 .    in the following sections two types of hybridization models are considered : the purely `` local '' hybridization and the `` nearest neighbor '' ( n.n . )",
    "one . in the n.n .",
    "hybridization there are electronic transitions between localized ( `` f '' ) states at a site and conduction wannier states at the nearest neighbor sites , while in the local hybridization those transitions only occur at the same site .",
    "the same type of diagram cancellation obtained by metzner for the hubbard model is obtained for these two hybridization models in the pam .    as the local hybridization between @xmath10 and @xmath11 or @xmath12 electrons should vanish when the site has inversion symmetry , the n.n .",
    "hybridization discussed in this paper is more realistic than the local one , because it does not necessarily vanish for that type of site . the local approximation is usually employed because it makes the calculation simpler ; and the changes introduced by an interatomic hybridization have been already discussed in the case of a diatomic - molecule model@xcite .",
