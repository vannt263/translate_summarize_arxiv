    "@xcite however , @xmath19 does not show a distinct change in its slope at @xmath6 , and the reduction of the resistivity below @xmath6 seems to be a parallel shift .",

    "this anisotropy is probably related to the anisotropic magnetization .",
    "one of the remarkable features is that the steep increase of the @xmath5-axis magnetization _ does not _ induce large negative magnetoresistance in both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "figures  [ fig.5](c ) and [ fig.5](d ) show a closer look at the magnetization and @xmath47 at @xmath49 below 1  koe .",
    "@xmath47 roughly keeps its initial value during the steep increase of magnetization , and then it begins to decrease after the magnetization changes its field dependence above 120  oe ( indicated by a dotted line ) .",
    "similar plateau in @xmath47 is also observed when we apply the field along the in - plane direction ( figs .",
    "[ fig.5](e ) and [ fig.5](f ) ) . for @xmath27 @xmath50 plane",
    ", we did not observe negative magnetoresistance near @xmath27 = 0  t. on the contrary , small positive magnetoresistance was observed below 2  koe .",
    "the corresponding magnetization evolution with @xmath27 @xmath50 plane is rather smooth , and it is difficult to assign where the magnetization shows a kink .",
    "however , the initial evolution of the magnetization seems to be proportional to the applied field ( indicated by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](e ) ) , and starts to deviate from the linear relation roughly above 3  koe . at the same field",
    ", @xmath47 begins to show large negative magnetoresistance , and we think that the low - field and high - field behaviors are qualitatively different as was observed in @xmath27 @xmath51 plane configuration .    to summarize our observation , 1 ) the low - field steep increase of magnetization does not induce negative magnetoresistance , and 2 ) the additional magnetization following the low - field one induces negative magnetoresistance .",
    "this result implies that two dominant contributions to the magnetization should be considered .",
    "first we discuss the origin of magnetic moment induced by pb substitution for bi . for this purpose ,",
    "we assume [ bi@xmath15sro@xmath0]@xmath0[coo@xmath0]@xmath17 as the chemical composition of the parent compound .",
    "@xcite since bi@xmath10 and sr@xmath52 ions are nonmagnetic , most of the magnetic properties are attributed to co ions .",
    "the reported chemical composition gives average valence of co ion as + 3.33 .",
    "two scenarios then become possible to account for this non - integer valence : 1 ) one of three co ions takes localized 4 + state while the others take localized 3 + state , or 2 ) one mobile hole is doped per three co@xmath10 sites . in the previous magnetization measurement by tarascon _",
    ", it was suggested that most of the co ions are in the 3 + state and takes low - spin state with @xmath11 = 0 . @xcite",
    "even though their treatment of the chemical composition is possibly incorrect , absence of the large magnetic moment is still an experimental fact .",
    "thus the former case does not seem to be the current case .",
    "the latter is more probable , and we can imagine that holes have been already doped in a pb - free sample .",
    "note that metallic conductivity was observed even in the pb - free samples @xcite , which suggests the presence of holes even in the parent compound .",
    "recent photoemission experiment also supports the same conclusion .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to see that the magnetic susceptibility of naco@xmath0o@xmath7 , which has a similar coo@xmath0 hexagonal layer , is quite similar to our data .",
    "the nominal composition of naco@xmath0o@xmath7 gives averaged co valence as 3.5 + .",
    "if we adopt localized - moment picture , half of the co ions should be in the 4 + state that will have @xmath11 = 1/2 or @xmath11 = 5/2 for low - spin or high - spin configurations , respectively .",
    "however , the magnetic susceptibility is far smaller than that expected for such localized picture .",
    "@xcite recent local density approximation ( lda ) calculation for naco@xmath0o@xmath7 implies that co @xmath12 band is located at the fermi level ( @xmath53 ) , and dominates all the magnetic properties of naco@xmath0o@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite if we apply this expectation also to ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o because of the similarity of the crystal structure of hexagonal coo@xmath0 plane , the doped holes are located at co @xmath12 band , and we do not have to take the contribution of other bands into account .",
    "then how the pb substitution changes the spin system ?",
    "one of the important roles of the pb substitution is to introduce additional holes . using the measured chemical composition and assuming that the oxygen content is the same as that in the parent compound",
    ", we can estimate the average valence of co ions as 3.52 + for our sample .",
    "the number of holes fairly increases and the electronic conduction is enhanced , which has been already observed in our previous studies .",
    "another significant role of the pb substitution is to modify the crystal parameters .",
    "as was reported , pb substitution induces a discontinuous decrease in the @xmath54-axis length of the bi@xmath15sro@xmath0 layer and expands the @xmath5-axis length simultaneously .",
    "@xcite since we have no data on the structural change in the coo@xmath0 layer , at present it is difficult to discuss the effect of the structural change to the electronic state . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] and ref . 7 , however , the increase of the effective bohr magneton above @xmath6 by the pb substitution suggests that the pb substitution also increases the number of localized spins , and such spins may contribute to the formation of ferromagnetic long - range order .    before discussing the relation between ferromagnetic long - range order and magnetoresistance in the next section , it is better to mention the possibility of itinerant ferromagnetism in this system .",
    "it is well known that ferromagnetic long - range order can also be observed in an itinerant electron system . in our case",
    ", the @xmath5-axis magnetization seems to be explained also by weak ferromagnetism of itinerant electrons .",
    "however , the anisotropic magnetization in the weak - ferromagnetic state is hardly explained by the itinerant ferromagnetism . to our knowledge",
    ", there has been no theory of itinerant ferromagnetism with highly anisotropic magnetization .",
    "although this does not exclude the possibility that our highly two - dimensional system exhibits an itinerant ferromagnetism by unknown mechanism , it is better to explain our results based on the localized - spin model .",
    "once we assume that the localized moments are induced by pb substitution , we can explain the field dependence of the magnetization .",
    "the magnitude of the spontaneous magnetization is quite small below @xmath6 , and subsequently the field - induced magnetization keeps increasing at least up to 7  t. this field dependence strongly indicates that the system goes into a weak - ferromagnetic state . in a conventional weak ferromagnet",
    "a certain antiferromagnetic unit has a finite ferromagnetic moment , and a magnetization process is separated in two parts . in a low - field region ,",
    "inversion of the direction of the weak ferromagnetic moment gives steep evolution of the magnetization , while at high - field region each spin tends to be aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "at the present case , spins are probably confined roughly within the @xmath38 plane , and are tilted a little toward the @xmath5-axis direction . then a single coo@xmath0 layer can have a weak ferromagnetic moment along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the absence of net bulk magnetization at @xmath27 = 0  oe indicates that such weak ferromagnetic layers are stacked randomly or alternatingly along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "when the @xmath5-axis field reaches 120  oe , these weak ferromagnetic moments point to the same direction . above the critical field each spins begins to be aligned along the @xmath5 axis , which corresponds to an increase in the magnitude of weak - ferromagnetic moment .",
    "along both for @xmath55 plane and @xmath49 .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) show the data up to 7  t. ( c ) and ( d ) show a closer look around the saturation field under @xmath56 where the magnetization and @xmath47 change their field dependence .",
    "( e ) and ( f ) show a closer look around the saturation field under @xmath55 plane where @xmath47 changes its field dependence . ]    2    the magnetization process along the plane direction is rather moderate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](e ) .",
    "however , a careful look at the magnetization allows us to divide its behavior in two regions .",
    "the linear evolution of the magnetization is observed up to 3  koe , where the in - plane resistance begins to decrease . above 3  koe , magnetization deviates from this linear relation ( dashed line ) .",
    "this feature is different from that of a typical weak ferromagnet with strong easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "the presence of finite linear m / h regions along both directions during the field inversion process suggests a more complicated situation of pb - doped bi - sr - co - o , and we expect that the hexagonal network of co ions plays an important role .",
    "next we discuss the mechanism of large negative magnetoresistance .",
    "one of the characteristics of the magnetoresistive behavior is the resistance plateau below the critical field .",
    "the weak ferromagnetic state can explain this plateau .",
    "since the low - field magnetization perpendicular to the @xmath38 plane is considered to be an ordering process for the weak ferromagnetic moment of each coo@xmath0 layer .",
    "the change in the direction of weak ferromagnetic moment is probably accomplished by the inversion of each spin .",
    "this process _ does not _ modify the relative angle of spins in the same coo@xmath0 layer , and therefore , the in - plane resistance does not need to be influenced . a similar process has been discussed in a layered perovskite manganite ( la , sr)@xmath14mn@xmath0o@xmath57 . @xcite in such a manganite , a ferromagnetic moment is attributed to each layer , and there is a transition at which the long - range order of this moment develops along the @xmath5 directions . at this transition temperature , the in - plane resistivity does not change much while the out - of - plane resistivity drastically changes .",
    "once the field exceeds the critical value , each spin begins to rotate toward the same direction , and as a result , in - plane resistance can decrease under a strong coupling between the itinerant holes and the localized moments .",
    "when the field is applied parallel to the plane , large magnetoresistance begins to appear above 3  koe .",
    "this indicates that spins do not drastically change their relative angle below 3  koe . as we mentioned before , the in - plane",
    "magnetization process is not simple , but again the hexagonal lattice may play a key role .",
    "we need further investigations of this system to reveal the magnetic structure with various experimental techniques , such as nmr , esr , and neutron scattering .",
    "the origin of the weak ferromagnetism is still an open question . in a conventional weak ferromagnetic state ,",
    "spin - spin interaction is basically antiferromagnetic , and the secondary interaction tend to ca nt spins toward a certain direction .",
    "two kinds of the origin of such spin canting have been known : antisymmetric exchange interaction and single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the former was first discussed by dzyaloshinskii , @xcite and later microscopically formulated by moriya .",
    "@xcite however , this type of antisymmetric interaction can exist only when the crystal symmetry of two neighboring magnetic ions is sufficiently low . since we do not consider that all the co ions have localized magnetic moments , it is difficult to imagine that the antisymmetric interaction plays an important role between such diluted magnetic moments .",
    "the latter single - ion anisotropy is also inapplicable if the induced moment is attributed to a low - spin co@xmath58 ion .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the low - spin co@xmath58 state is probably quenched , and thus the single - ion anisotropy can not exist . only when co@xmath58 ion is in a high - spin state , this scenario is possible .",
    "preliminary photoemission spectroscopy suggests that the co@xmath58 ion induced by pb - substitution is in the low - spin state , @xcite and thus we can not simply apply this mechanism .",
    "to summarize we have investigated the transport and the magnetic properties of single - crystal ( bi@xmath59pb@xmath60)sr@xmath61co@xmath62o@xmath63 .",
    "the large anisotropy is found in the electronic conduction parallel and perpendicular to the plane , which reaches to 10@xmath64 .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition takes place at very low temperature with small spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the large negative magnetoresistance is observed around the transition temperature , which strongly depends on the direction of magnetic field .",
    "recently several layered compounds including hexagonal coo@xmath0 layers have been investigated from the viewpoint of electric and magnetic properties : such as naco@xmath0o@xmath7 ( ref .",
    "11 ) , and ca@xmath14co@xmath7o@xmath2 misfit layer compound .",
