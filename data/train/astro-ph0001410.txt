    "bl lac objects are usually divided in two main classes , on the basis of their overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) : lbl or hbl ( low or high energy peaked bl lacs ) , according as the peak of the synchrotron emission ( in a @xmath2 representation ) is in the ir  optical or euv  soft - x band , respectiveley . in the x - ray band",
    "this usually translates in a spectral index which is steep ( @xmath3 ) for hbls ( corresponding to the tail of the synchrotron emission ) and flat ( @xmath4 ) for lbls ( corresponding to the upcoming of the inverse compton emission ) . in 1997 , the _",

    "ray spectral index . in order to find and study other sources with such",
    " extreme \" properties , we have selected several candidates from the einstein slew survey and the rosat all sky survey bright sources catalogue ( rassbsc ) .    the selection criteria were based on properties suggesting a high @xmath5 : + a ) very high @xmath6 ratio ( @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 / jy , at [ 0.12.4 ] kev and 5 ghz respectively ) ; b ) flat x - ray spectrum ( when available ) , connecting smoothly with the flux at lower frequencies ; c ) appropriate values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) . a high x ",

    "whose wide x  ray energy range ( 0.1200 kev ) is ideal to constrain the synchrotron peak .",
    "four objects have been observed , between june 1998 and april 1999 : 1es 0120 + 340 , pks 0548322 , 1es 1426 + 428 and h 2356309 . in fig . 1 and table 1",

    "lecs , mecs and pds data have been reduced and analysed according to the sdc cookbook instructions , using the latest calibration matrices available .",
    "standard extraction radii of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for mecs and lecs were used , except for the pks 0548322 observation of 20/2/99 : in this case a @xmath16 radius for the lecs has been used , due to the presence of a contaminating source in the field of view ( identified as the star ` gsc_07061_01558 ` in the guide star catalog , probably flaring ) . + the pds instrument does nt have imaging capabilities , and its f.o.v .",

    "we have also checked in the ned and wgacat databases for other potentially contaminating objects : we added the contributions of the two most important objects ( wga j1426.1 + 4247 and crss 1429.7 + 4240 , fig",
