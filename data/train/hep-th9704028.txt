    "the skyrme model @xcite has had some success in describing both single nucleon properties and the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to see how well the model performs for larger nuclei .",
    "classical multiskyrmion solutions are known up to baryon number @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , these must be quantised before any comparison to the real world can be made .",
    "it is generally agreed that a proper treatment of the skyrme model as a quantum field theory is difficult . instead",
    ", a limited number of degrees of freedom are quantised , and usually only the zero mode collective coordinates @xcite .",
    "this reduces the model to finite - dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that @xmath3 degrees of freedom are required to describe a system containing @xmath4 nucleons ( as would be required for @xmath4 widely separated skyrmions ) .",
    "however , minimal energy solutions for @xmath5 are in general single large solitons , which have a maximum of 9 zero modes .",
    "therefore even for a very limited quantisation it is necessary to include additional discrete modes .",
    "this is the principal motivation for the calculation of the vibrational spectra of multiskyrmions .",
    "a full quantisation should also include the effects of the soliton on the vacuum fluctuations , or radiation .",
    "we shall not attempt this here , but will merely present a new method for computing normal mode spectra , with particular reference to the @xmath6 solution .",
    "the results for @xmath1 are described in a concurrent paper @xcite .",
    "a similar calculation was recently performed by walet @xcite for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , using the yang - mills instanton - induced form for the skyrme fields .",
    "the main differences in the present calculation is that we do not employ this approximation , and also explicitly include a pion mass term in the lagrangian .",
    "this mass term clearly plays a key role in determining which vibrational modes are bound .",
    "the vibrational spectra are interesting in their own right , especially since we have discovered hitherto unsuspected similarities between the two cases considered .",
    "in particular , the spectrum divides into two types of modes .",
    "the lower modes correspond to those expected from an approximate correspondence between bps monopoles and skyrmions @xcite .",
    "going up in frequency , one encounters first the ` breather ' and then higher multipole breathing modes . while the structure of the spectrum is interesting , we emphasise that it represents merely a first step in a rather more ambitious long term project , namely the computation of properties of quantised multiskyrmions .",
    "the basic idea behind our method for calculating the bound state spectrum is quite simple .",
    "first , the classical solution is obtained by numerical relaxation .",
    "it is then very slightly perturbed , and the resulting configuration evolved for a long time at constant energy . during this process , field values at certain points",
    "are recorded as a function of time .",
    "this data can then be fourier analysed to obtain power spectra .",
    "both the relaxation to the classical solution , and the subsequent time evolution after perturbation , require numerical solution of the skyrme equations .",
    "the development of a fast computer code to perform this task lies at the heart of our method . in the current letter",
    ", we shall only briefly outline the main ideas underlying our algorithm ; further details may be found in @xcite .",
    "the skyrme model has three free parameters : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the work of walet @xcite indicates that binding energies after quantisation probably depend very sensitively on these parameters .",
    "we defer further discussion of parameters until the full calculation has been performed . instead",
    ", we will express our results in terms of the usual dimensionless skyrme units @xcite . in these units ,",
    "the topological lower bound on the energy is @xmath11 , and the skyrme lagrangian density is @xmath12[l^{\\mu } , l^{\\nu } ] ) + 4 \\beta^{2 } ( tru -2 ) ,    \\label{ldef}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the su(2)-valued scalar field ( @xmath16 are the pauli matrices ) . for definiteness , we have set @xmath17 , following adkins and nappi@xcite , although eventually we would would hope to extend the calculation to treat @xmath18 as a free parameter .",
    "the action @xmath19 is discretised on a finite lattice , and the equations of motion are derived by varying with respect to each field component @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) , at each point in the lattice .",
    "the @xmath22 constraint is enforced by the introduction of a term @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a lagrange multiplier . at this point",
    "we run into the usual problem that the `` kinetic '' ( ie .",
    "time dependent ) part of the quartic skyrme term causes coupling between nearest neighbours in time and space .",
    "the problem is trivially solved for the initial relaxation by simply ignoring the offending terms , which are irrelevant for a static solution . but to compute the normal modes we must consider small fluctuations about the static solution : @xmath25 . if we linearise in @xmath26 ( just for the problematic terms ) , then the system of equations uncouples , and we are left with an equation of the form @xmath27 at each point , where @xmath28 is a constant related to the lagrange multiplier . the @xmath22 constraint can then be invoked for @xmath29 , to produce a quadratic equation which can be solved for @xmath28 .",
    "this can then be substituted back into equation  ( [ form ] ) to define the time evolution .",
    "our simulations are carried out on a finite lattice of @xmath30 points , of total volume @xmath31 , so that the lattice spacing @xmath32 .",
    "deuteron spectra have been calculated for a variety of box sizes and latice spacings .",
    "we find that the frequencies observed show no discernible dependence on lattice spacing , provided that the lattice spacing is no larger than about 0.125 in our length units .",
    "there is , however , significant dependence on box size . figure  [ fig : power ] shows deuteron spectra for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "our code uses periodic boundary conditions , so the finite size effects can be understood in terms of the interaction between neighbouring ` image ' solitons . since a pion mass term is included explicitly in the lagrangian , these effects should decay exponentially as @xmath35 increases .",
    "the frequencies observed for @xmath34 should already be a reasonable approximation to the infinite separation ( box size ) limit ; however , this can eventually be improved , with more data , by fitting the exponential curve , and extrapolating .",
    "having obtained the normal mode spectrum , the next problem is to interpret it .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between vibrational modes and radiation , and we also wish to determine the degeneracy and symmetry of all modes .",
    "note that radiative modes are discrete , rather than forming a continuum above the pion mass , because of the finite box size .",
    "for the same reason , bound states are possible above the pion mass . in an infinite volume box ,",
    "radiation continuum modes at the frequencies of the vibrational modes would mix with the latter , causing them to be spatially extended out to infinity . in a finite box , however , the relevant continuum modes may be absent , causing the vibrational modes above the pion mass to be spatially localised .    to gain information about the observed peaks ,",
    "the process of time evolution is repeated , this time projecting out all previously identified frequencies .",
    "we thus obtain fourier amplitudes for each mode , at all points on the lattice for each field component @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the difference between the actual field value at a given time , and the static solution . for each frequency , the total time of integration is chosen to be an exact multiple of the period of oscillation .",
    "the inner product between two such amplitudes can be defined @xmath38 with summation implied , where @xmath39 is the matrix which multiplies @xmath40 on the left hand side of the ( linearised ) skyrme equations .",
    "it effectively plays the role of a spatially dependent inertia tensor in the dynamics .",
    "the inner product is defined in this way to ensure orthogonality between modes of different frequency .",
    "the most immediate concern is to distinguish between bound modes and radiation in the spectrum . to do this , it is useful to calculate the norm of a given mode as a function of radius",
    ". instead of integrating @xmath41 over the whole box , we instead integrate only for @xmath30 points in a cube in the middle . by varying @xmath4 , @xmath41",
    "is mapped out as a function of `` radius '' ( or side length ) .",
    "if a particular mode is bound , then it should be localised at or near the static solution .",
    "thus the curve of @xmath41 vs @xmath4 should rise steeply at a radius corresponding roughly to the soliton , then flatten out as the edge of the box is approached .",
    "radiation , on the other hand , should be spread evenly throughout the box , giving a curve going approximately as @xmath30 , rising most steeply at the edge .",
    "the curves for the six modes labelled in figure  [ fig : power ] are plotted in figure  [ fig : curves ] .",
    "it is clear that the curves do indeed display characteristic shapes , so that this method successfully provides a clear distinction between bound modes and radiation .",
    "we conclude that modes 3 and 4 are radiative , whereas modes 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 are bound .",
    "the next obvious question is the degeneracy of all the modes .",
    "if a given frequency @xmath42 is @xmath43-fold degenerate , then an @xmath44 matrix of inner products @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 ) , will only have @xmath43 non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "fourier amplitudes from different runs , with different random initial perturbations , ( but for the same frequency ) , can be used to calculate the degeneracies via this method .",
    "however , cleaner results are often obtained by taking one amplitude , then generating more by applying different symmetry operations .",
    "the symmetries used must leave the static solution invariant ; they generally consist of a physical transformation followed by an isospin transformation of the pion fields . using this method",
    ", we find that modes 3 and 5 are singlets , while peaks 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 correspond to doublets .    the only remaining issue concerns symmetry .",
    "we wish to classify all the modes according to the representation they form of the symmetry group of the static solution .",
    "the classical @xmath6 multiskyrmion is axially symmetric , and in addition possesses a reflection symmetry in the plane of the torus .",
    "the symmetry group is @xmath47 , axial symmetry extended by inversion .",
    "its character table is given in table  [ tab : char ] .",
    "the notation of hamermesh@xcite has been used for the conjugacy classes and the singlet representations .",
    "@xmath48 is the identity , @xmath49 is rotation by angle @xmath50 , @xmath51 is reflection in any plane including the @xmath52-axis , and @xmath53 is inversion .",
    "the singlet representations are labelled @xmath54 or @xmath55 to indicate whether they are even or odd under parity , while the @xmath56 or @xmath57 refers to their behaviour under @xmath51 .",
    "there are an infinite number of doublets , labelled by an integer @xmath43 , and parity .",
    ".character table for @xmath47 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is clear that singlet representations are distinguished by their properties under @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "the symmetries of modes 3 and 5 can therefore be determined by taking matrix elements of these operators @xmath58    for doublet states , the simplest way to determine @xmath43 is to search for the lowest angle @xmath50 such that @xmath59 ( this implies that @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "if the lowest angle @xmath62 then @xmath63 , if @xmath64 then @xmath65 , and so on . in practice , @xmath63 or 2 are the only realistic values , so the matrix elements of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , together with inversion , provide sufficient information to distinguish the representations .",
    "@xmath68    to summarise , the first peak is a doublet , with symmetry @xmath69 . this is the representation under which axial vectors transform in @xmath47 .",
    "these states do not correspond to true vibrations , but rather represent two broken zero modes , spatial rotations of the torus around the @xmath70 and @xmath71 axes .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions of the lattice introduce the possibility of low energy ` spin waves ' , whose frequency will decrease as the box size increases , eventually reverting to zero modes in the infinite limit .",
    "this explains the extreme shift in frequency observed for this mode when the box size is changed from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the second peak in the spectrum represents the first true finite frequency bound modes .",
    "they are doubly degenerate , with a quadrupole symmetry @xmath72 .",
    "if amplified , these would become the classic @xmath0 scattering of two skyrmions .",
    "there is also a close analogy to the scattering of bps monopoles .",
    "the zero modes of the two - monopole toroidal bps solution may be fairly simply understood .",
    "the bps solutions are associated with rational maps constructed as follows .",
    "a complex variable @xmath52 is associated with each direction in space through a projective map .",
    "the complex @xmath52 plane is embedded in three euclidean dimensions , and a unit two - sphere is drawn centered on the origin .",
    "each direction @xmath73 defines a point on the two - sphere , which is then projected from one of the poles of the two - sphere onto the @xmath52 plane .",
    "one then defines a rational map @xmath74 which is a ratio of polynomials in @xmath52 , each up to @xmath75 for a n - monopole solution .",
    "just as @xmath52 defines a direction in real space , @xmath74 defines one in internal space , acted on by the global @xmath22 symmetry via moebius transformations @xmath76 , with @xmath77 and @xmath18 being the 11 and 12 matrix elements of the @xmath22 matrix .    for special choices of @xmath74 , the solutions exhibit enlarged symmetry . in our case , the 2-monopole solution represented by @xmath78 is the toriodal solution which has @xmath47 symmetry .",
    "it is invariant under rotations @xmath79 combined with isospin rotations @xmath80 , and also inversions @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the general perturbed 2-monopole solution is represented by @xmath83 where the coefficient of @xmath84 in the numerator is taken to be unity and the complex parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath9 are small .",
    "these parameters are not invariant under @xmath47 , but transform according to some irreducible representation , which has ten real dimensions .",
    "it is straightforward to check by computing the characters of the symmetry group elements that the representation is @xmath89 @xmath56 @xmath90 + @xmath91 @xmath56 @xmath92 @xmath56 @xmath93 @xmath56 @xmath94 .",
    "the isospin zero modes comprise the @xmath90 representation , the rotational zero modes comprise the @xmath91 @xmath56 @xmath92 representation and the tranlational zero modes the @xmath93 @xmath56 @xmath94 representation .",
    "this leaves the @xmath89 representation as the remaining nontrivial zero mode of the 2-monopole bps solution .",
    "and this representation coincides with our results for the lowest vibrational mode of the deuteron in the skyrme model .",
    "the next two frequencies correspond to radiation , with wave number @xmath95 .",
    "these modes are split , rather than forming a degenerate triplet , because the pion fields of the static solution do not all transform the same way .",
    "the radiative modes fall into the same representations as the static solution pions : @xmath96 .",
    "the fifth peak is a breathing mode , where the size of the soliton fluctuates with no change in shape .",
    "it is a singlet , and transforms trivially under @xmath47 , as would be expected .",
    "the sixth peak represents the last bound states .",
    "these form a doublet , with symmetry @xmath97 .",
    "the torus expands on one side while contracting on the other , a dipole ` breathing ' motion .",
    "altogether then , we have found five finite energy normal modes in the deuteron spectrum .",
    "the normal mode spectrum of the deuteron has been calculated .",
    "the nature of all states has been identified , and their degeneracies and symmetries calculated .",
    "we find a bound doublet below the pion mass , which is related to @xmath0 scattering between two skyrmions .",
    "two more bound states appear above the pion mass : a breather , plus a second doublet with a dipole symmetry .",
    "the overall pattern of the deuteron spectrum displays a remarkable similarity to that recently found for the @xmath1 solution @xcite .",
    "there again , all modes below the pion mass can be related to those expected from an approximate correspondence with the zero modes of bps multimonopoles .",
    "the first @xmath1 bound mode above the pion mass is a breather , and the remaining bound modes involve ` breathing ' motion of the baryon density .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that a similar pattern will be observed for all multiskyrmion spectra , but more examples are required to confirm this .",
    "one further remark may be worthwhile .",
    "we have found five finite energy bound modes in the deuteron spectrum . added to the eight zero modes , this makes a total of 13 .",
    "sixteen bound modes were found for @xmath1 , giving a total of 25 . in both cases , then , there is a total of @xmath98 modes , one more than is usually expected .",
    "the `` extra '' mode is the breather ; every multiskyrmion , including the single skyrmion , must have such a mode .",
    "the remaining vibrational modes can be considered as corresponding to the broken zero modes of the separated skyrmions .",
