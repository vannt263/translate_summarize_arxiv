    "the gradual penetration of magnetic flux in type - ii superconductors subjected to an increasing applied field or electrical current can be interrupted by dramatic avalanches in the vortex matter.@xcite the mechanism responsible for the avalanches is that an initial fluctuation reduces locally the pinning of some vortices , which start to move , thus creating dissipation followed by depinning of even more vortices .",
    "a positive feedback loop is formed where a small perturbation can escalate into a macroscopic thermomagnetic breakdown.@xcite    in thin film superconductors , the dynamics and morphology of these avalanches is tantalizing , when at very high speeds they develop into complex dendritic structures , which once formed remain robust against changes in external conditions .",
    "when repeating identical experiments one finds that the patterns are never the same although qualitative features of the morphology , such as the degree of branching and overall size of the structure , show systematic dependences on , e.g. , temperature . using magneto - optical imaging flux avalanches with these characteristics have been observed in films of nb ,  @xcite yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ,  @xcite mgb@xmath0 ,  @xcite nb@xmath2sn ,  @xcite yni@xmath0b@xmath0c ,  @xcite and nbn .",

    "aranson et al.@xcite explored the dynamics of the flux avalanches as a numerical solution of maxwell s equations with temperature dependent critical current density .",
    "the dynamical process was governed by the interplay between an extremely nonlinear current - voltage relation , heat diffusion , and the nonlocal electrodynamics characteristic for thin superconducting films . to treat the nonlocal electrodynamics the authors used periodic continuation of the sample taken as an infinite strip .",
    "this scheme should be a good approximation inside the sample , although not necessarily close to the edges .",
    "in fact , in thin films the magnetic field near the edges is significantly enhanced  @xcite due to the flux expulsion .",
    "moreover , all experiments show that the instability is always nucleated at an edge .",
    "therefore , a careful account of the electrodynamics close to the edges , including the regions outside the film , is expected to be crucially important.@xcite    in this work we study the formation and characteristics of dendritic flux avalanches using a numerical scheme that takes into account the nonlocal electrodynamics both inside and outside a finite - sized superconducting film .",
    "it is shown that our simulations largely reproduces experimental results obtained by magneto - optical imaging of dendritic avalanches in films of mgb@xmath0 , and furthermore gives detailed insight into not yet observed quantities such as local temperature rise and electrical field .",
