    "the relative - locality framework of refs .",
    "@xcite is centered on the possibility of a non - trivial geometry for momentum space , and links to those geometric properties some effects of relativity of spacetime locality , such that events established to be coincident by nearby observers are not described as coincident in the coordinatization of spacetime by distant observers .",
    "interestingly , just like the relativity of simultaneity implies that there is no observer - independent projection from spacetime to separately space and time , relative locality implies that there is no observer - independent projection from a one - particle phase space to a description of the particle separately in spacetime and in momentum space . besides its intrinsic interest from the point of view of relativity research , this relative - locality framework appears to be also relevant  @xcite for the understanding of several issues which have emerged in the recent quantum - gravity literature .",
    "indeed several approaches to the study of the quantum - gravity problem have led to speculations about nonlinearities in momentum space that may admit geometric description ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and some related studies had hinted at possibly striking implications of such nonlinearities for the fate of locality at the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "evidently a pivotal role for the success ( or failure ) of this relative - locality proposal will be played by investigations of the relativistic description of distant observers , which is the main focus of the study we are here reporting .",
    "this is in itself an aspect of relative locality which is rather intriguing from a conceptual perspective . in previous evolutions of our relativistic theories",
    "the most subtle issues always concerned boost transformations , and therefore the relativistic description of pairs of observers with a relative boost .",
    "translational invariance , and therefore the relativistic description of distant observers , always admitted an elementary and fully intuitive description .",
    "this is particularly clear when looking at the transition from galilean relativity , and its description of relative rest , to special relativity , with einstein s description of relative simultaneity and rest : grasping the physical content of special relativity proved challenging because of properties of special - relativistic boosts , which force us to abandon a  common sense understanding \" .",
    "but special relativistic translations are no less trivial than galilean translations .",
    "this is because the special - relativistic notion of relative simultaneity is already fully characterized when focusing on pairs of observers connected by a pure boost transformation .",
    "but the relative - locality notion that an interaction established to be local by nearby observers may be described as nonlocal by distant observers evidently implies a crucial role for the identification of a corresponding formalization of translational symmetries , and we must therefore expect that ensuring a relativistic description of distant observers should be one of the main challenges for the formalization of relative locality .    a crucial step toward the understanding of these issues here of interest , concerning the interplay between relative locality and translation symmetries ,",
    "is already found in refs .",
    "for example , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , one could describe the process in figure  [ oksofarfig ] , which is the idealized case with 3 particles of energy - momenta @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 all incoming , on the basis of the following action : @xmath4 + \\mathcal{n}_p\\mathcal{c}\\left[p\\right]+\\mathcal{n}_q\\mathcal{c}\\left[q\\right]\\right ) -\\xi^{\\mu}\\mathcal{k}_\\mu(s_{0 } ) \\ . \\end{split } \\label{actionfirst}\\ ] ]    as we shall here discuss in greater detail in section  [ setup ] , the bulk part of @xmath5 ends up characterizing  @xcite the propagation of the 3 particles , with the lagrange multiplier @xmath6 ( and similarly @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) enforcing the on - shell relation @xmath9= d^2(k)-m^2 $ ] , with @xmath10 in turn derived from the metric on momentum space as the distance of @xmath1 from the origin of momentum space . and",
    "the form of the boundary term @xmath11 is such that  @xcite the lagrange multipliers @xmath12 enforce the condition @xmath13 , so that by taking for @xmath14 a suitable composition of the momenta @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 the boundary terms enforces a law of conservation of momentum at the interaction .",
    "the form of the law of composition of momenta used for the conservation law @xmath13 is governed by the affine connection on momentum space  @xcite , and may involve nonlinear terms which are ultimately responsible for the relativity of spacetime locality .",
    "this is indeed seen by studying the invariance of the action @xmath5 under translations of the coordinates of worldline points @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which each observer introduces as variables that are canonically conjugate to the coordinates on momentum space @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the observations used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the derivations that established the presence of this translational invariance appeared to rely crucially on some simplifications afforded only by the case of a single - interaction process . as here",
    "stressed in section  [ setup ] , for a single interaction several alternative choices of boundary terms enforcing the same conservation law are consistent with the presence of relativistic translation symmetries within the relative - locality framework of ref .",
    "however , the demands of translational invariance become much more constraining when 2 or more interactions are causally connected , _",
    "i.e. _ when a particle outgoing from one interaction is incoming into another interaction . in section",
    "[ main ] we provide an explicit example of formulation of the boundary terms which ensures translational invariance when several causally - linked interactions are analyzed . and the logical structure of our proposal",
    "is easily described : translation transformations are generated by the total - momentum charge ( obtained from individual particle momenta via the connection - induced composition law ) and the boundary terms are written as differences between the total momentum before the interaction and after the interaction ( so that the associated constraints automatically ensure conservation of the total momentum ) .    before getting to that main part of our analysis it will be useful to do some preparatory work . in the next section",
    "we motivate our focus on results that are obtained only at leading order in the deformation scale , by observing that , if indeed the deformation scale is roughly given by the planck scale , the experimental sensitivities foreseeable at least for the near future will not afford us investigations going much beyond the leading - order structure of the geometry of momentum space . and",
    "we also show that working at leading order not only simplifies matters in the way that is commonly encountered in physics , by shortening some computations , but in this case also provides some qualitative simplifications , including most notably the fact that at leading order the momentum - composition laws of the relative - locality framework are automatically associative .",
    "then in sections  [ kappamtotherightdir ] and  [ geometry ] we characterize the specific example of relative - locality momentum space on which we shall test our proposal for relativistic translational symmetries .",
    "this is based on results obtained in the @xmath0-minkowski/@xmath0-poincar framework , where indeed evidence of a deformed on - shell relation and of a nonlinear law of composition of momenta has been discussed for more than a decade , but without appreciating the implications for how distant observers would characterize events that are found to be coincident by nearby observers .",
    "we find that this @xmath0-poincar - inspired momentum space has de sitter metric and parallel transport governed by a non - metric and torsionful connection .",
    "equipped with these preliminary observations we then discuss , in section  [ setup ] , the challenges that must be dealt with in seeking a translationally - invariant description of chains of causally connected interactions within the relative - locality framework proposed in ref .",
    "the main insight gained from the analysis reported in section  [ setup ] is that in order to achieve translational invariance it is not sufficient to ensure that the boundary terms at endpoints of worldlines enforce some suitable momentum - conservation laws , since in general two such choices of boundary terms at the endpoints of a finite worldline ( a worldline going from one interaction to another ) will spoil translational invariance .",
    "section  [ kbobreview ] is a short aside on some characterizations of relative locality confined to a hamiltonian description of free particles  @xcite which serves two purposes : it prepares the rest of our analysis by reviewing some concepts about the type of symplectic structure that is traditionally used in the @xmath0-minkowski/@xmath0-poincar literature , and its characterization of relative locality for free particles is then of reference for our description of a free - particle limit , which is an important corollary result of our proposal for interacting particles .",
    "it is in section  [ main ] that the reader finds our main results concerning the proposal and analysis of a relativistic formulation of processes involving several interactions , within the general framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , with translational invariance assured by a corresponding specification of the boundary conditions that implement momentum conservation .",
    "we test the robustness of our proposal mainly by applying it to the illustrative example of the @xmath0-poincar - inspired momentum space .",
    "section  [ secgrbs ] contains our results that are of particular significance from the perspective of phenomenology .",
    "we show that , within our setup for @xmath0-poincar interacting particles , simultaneously - emitted massless particles do not necessarily reach the same detector at the same time . since our @xmath0-poincar momentum space has nonmetricity , this is consistent with the thesis put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which these time delays at detection for simultaneously - emitted massless particles are to be expected when nonmetricity is present .",
    "in addition we also investigate how the torsion of our @xmath0-poincar momentum space affects these time - of - detection delays , an issue for which no previous result is applicable .",
    "and we find that the torsion does affect the time delays , by essentially rendering the effect non - systematic : the time - of - detection difference for two simultaneously emitted massless particles depends non only on the momenta of the two particles involved but also on some properties of the events that emitted the two particles .",
    "we also discuss the first elements of a phenomenology that could exploit this striking feature .",
    "in deriving the results reported in sections  [ main ] and  [ secgrbs ] we use @xmath0-poincar illustrative example non only in the sense that we adopt the metric and connection of the  @xmath0-momentum space \" ( of sections  [ kappamtotherightdir ] and  [ geometry ] ) but also by imposing upon us the use of the nontrivial symplectic structure that is preferred in the @xmath0-poincar literature .",
    "however , in section  [ itsgeometry ] we keep the @xmath0-poincar momentum space while switching to a trivial symplectic structure , and we reproduce again the results of section  [ secgrbs ] .",
    "this allows us to establish that the predictions derived in section  [ secgrbs ] are purely manifestations of momentum space geometry .",
    "section  [ closingsec ] contains some closing remarks , mostly focusing on the outlook of the relative - locality research program .",
    "we adopt units such that the speed - of - light scale ( speed of massless particles in the infrared limit ) and the reduced planck constant are @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "and we denote by @xmath23 the momentum - space - deformation scale .",
    "of course , @xmath23 carries dimensions of inverse momentum , and a natural quantum - gravity - inspired estimate would be to have @xmath24 roughly of the order of the planck scale .",
    "the issues studied in this manuscript are of exactly the same nature in the case of a 4d momentum space and in the case of a 2d momentum space , and we shall often ( but not always ) focus for definiteness and simplicity on the 2d case . when not otherwise specified we shall switch between 4d and 2d formulas by simply denoting with @xmath25 the momentum in the 4d case and with @xmath26 the momentum in the 2d case .",
    "refs .  @xcite ( also see refs .",
    "@xcite ) raised the issue of determining experimentally the geometry of momentum space , much like it is traditional in physics to study experimentally the geometry of spacetime .",
    "+ it is however important to notice a crucial difference : while we do have experimental access to distance scales larger than the scales of curvature of spacetime , it is very unlikely that in the foreseeable future we could have experimental access to momentum scales even just comparable to the planck scale , which is the natural candidate for the scale of curvature of the relative - locality momentum space  @xcite .",
    "+ it should be appreciated that this disappointing limitation of our horizons on the geometry of momentum space can also be turned in some sense into a powerful weapon for the phenomenology of momentum - space geometry : evidently all we need is a characterization of the geometry of momentum space near the origin , where @xmath27 . and at least at first this will essentially be focused on the search of leading - order evidence of a nontrivial geometry of momentum space .    for what concerns the affine connection on momentum space , responsible for the nontrivial properties of the law of composition of momenta  @xcite , all we need for the purposes of this phenomenology are the ( @xmath23-rescaled ) connection coefficients on momentum space evaluated at @xmath28 , which we denote by @xmath29 : @xmath30 and evidently the fact that the phenomenology only needs leading - order results implies ( also considering that we already rescaled the connection coefficients by the planck scale ) that we can treat the @xmath31 as pure numbers .",
    "analogous considerations lead us to focus on momentum - space metrics that are at most linear in the momenta : @xmath32 and , just like the @xmath29 , we should handle the coefficients @xmath33 as pure numbers in our leading - order phenomenology .    in this manuscript",
    "we shall mainly work only at leading order in the deformation scale , and it will be evident that this provides with significant advantages . in particular , at leading order in the deformation",
    "scale the momentum - composition law is always associative .",
    "this can be established by writing a general leading - order composition law as follows : @xmath34 and then noticing that indeed ( of course to leading - order accuracy ) @xmath35_\\mu =   k_\\mu + p_\\mu + q_\\mu -   \\ell \\ , \\gamma^{\\alpha \\beta}_\\mu \\left ( k_\\alpha p_\\beta + k_\\alpha q_\\beta + p_\\alpha q_\\beta \\right ) = [ k \\oplus ( p \\oplus q)]_\\mu ~. \\label{tribodytorsynok}\\ ] ] beyond leading order the composition law could be nonassociative , and in that case one could appreciate the curvature of the momentum - space connection , with interesting but technically challenging consequences which we shall not encounter in this manuscript , and will never be encountered when working at leading order in the deformation scale .",
    "the fact that our horizons on the geometry of momentum space probably are confined to leading order may be viewed as an unpleasant philosophical limitation , but pragmatically can be turned into a powerful asset for phenomenology work on relative - locality momentum spaces , since the task of phenomenologists then is very clearly and simply specified : the target should be to determine experimentally ( as accurately as possible ) a few dimensionless numbers for the leading - order ( and possibly the next - to - leading order ) geometry of momentum space .    to make this point fully explicit",
    "let us for simplicity imagine a by 2d relative - locality momentum space . in the 2d case a full leading - order characterization of the momentum - space geometry requires establishing experimentally ( in hypothetical 2d experiments ) the 8 dimensionless parameters of the affine connection on momentum space , @xmath36 and the 6 dimensionless parameters of the leading - order description of the metric , which one can conveniently encode or in terms of the 6 independent christoffel symbols .",
    "indeed one finds that @xmath37 ] into the 6 free parameters of the associated christoffel symbols @xmath38 , @xmath39",
    "in this section we describe the construction of the momentum space motivated by the @xmath0-poincar framework  @xcite , which we shall call here , for short , the  @xmath0-momentum space \" .",
    "this @xmath0-momentum space will provide for us an example of momentum space , of some independent interest , on which to illustrate in tangible way the efficacy of the characterization of relative - locality distant observers , which is our main objective for this manuscript .    in this subsection",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite so we describe @xmath0-momentum space as a manifold of the group @xmath40 ( dubbed also the borel group ) , which is , as a manifold , essentially a half of de sitter space .",
    "the @xmath40 group is a subgroup of the de sitter @xmath41 group , defined by its lie algebra @xmath42 which has the following form : @xmath43=-{i}\\ell\\ , { \\cal x}^i\\ , , \\quad [ { \\cal x}^i,{\\cal x}^j]=0\\ , .\\ ] ] this algebra is a subalgebra of @xmath44 and one can represent it as an algebra of @xmath45 real matrices , with the matrices representing @xmath46 being nilpotent . knowing the form of the lie algebra , one can readily write down a group element .",
    "it is convenient to split it into the product of two elements , one generated by nilpotent elements @xmath46 and the second generated by the abelian one @xmath47 , @xmath48 clearly @xmath2 can be thought of as the coordinates on the group manifold .    since @xmath49 is a subgroup of de sitter group @xmath41 , @xmath50 defined by ( [ j4 ] ) acts naturally on points of the five dimensional minkowski space @xmath51",
    "therefore , if we take a point @xmath52 , the group @xmath49 as a manifold is just a set of all points of the form @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath52 has coordinates @xmath54 than the point @xmath55 , with @xmath50 given by ( [ j4 ] ) and represented as a @xmath45 matrix has minkowski coordinates @xmath56 one can easily check by direct computation that the coordinates @xmath57 , @xmath58 of these points satisfy the conditions @xmath59 and ( assuming that @xmath23 is negative ) @xmath60 thus , as a manifold , the @xmath49 group is an open subset of the four dimensional de sitter space ( [ j1 ] ) defined by the condition ( [ j1a ] ) , and the points in this manifold can be parametrized by coordinates @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noticing in passing that the unit element of the group @xmath49 , @xmath61 naturally corresponds to the zero momentum point @xmath62 of the momentum space , whose existence is required for the relative locality construction @xcite .",
    "since our momentum space , @xmath49 , is defined as a hyper - surface imbedded in the five dimensional minkowski space it possesses a natural induced metric , which can be obtained by inserting the relations ( [ j2 ] ) into the five dimensional minkowski metric @xmath63 using ( [ j1 ] ) one finds that this metric is nothing but the de sitter metric in flat coordinates @xmath64 we shall use this form of the metric in the next section , in the derivation of the on - shell relation of a particle on the @xmath0-momentum space .",
    "since our momentum space is a group manifold it is natural to assume that the momentum composition and is defined by the group multiplication law .",
    "if we have two group elements @xmath50 and @xmath65 then their product is a group element itself so that we can define the momentum composition @xmath66 as follows : @xmath67 it is worth stressing that since the group multiplication is associative , the composition @xmath66 is associative as well .    in the case of the @xmath40 group elements defined by ( [ j4 ] )",
    "we find @xmath68 so that @xmath69 which to the leading order in @xmath23 reads @xmath70    we can then introduce @xmath71 , the  antipode \" of @xmath72 , using the fact that the inverse of a group element is a group element itself : @xmath73 and in the case of the @xmath40 group we find @xmath74 and in the leading order we have @xmath75    in closing this subsection let us also observe that when the momentum space is a lie group there is a natural way to construct a free particle action .",
    "the idea is to identify the position space with a linear space dual to the lie algebra ( as a vector space ) and to make use of the canonical pairing between these dual spaces .",
    "concretely let us define the basis of the vector space @xmath76 dual to the lie algebra @xmath42 as follows : @xmath77 and let us take the space dual to the lie algebra of @xmath40 to be the space of positions so that @xmath78 then the kinetic term of the action of a particle with @xmath40 momentum space is @xmath79 substituting ( [ j4 ] ) , ( [ j27 ] ) , and ( [ j28 ] ) into ( [ j29 ] ) one easily finds that @xmath80 it is worth noticing that the same procedure can be applied to the standard case with flat momentum space , when the group associated with momentum composition is just an abelian group @xmath81 ( in our case we get the abelian limit when @xmath82 . )    it follows from ( [ j30 ] ) that positions variables @xmath83 have a nontrivial poisson bracket . to see this most easily , notice that with the help of the transformation @xmath84 one can diagonalize the kinetic lagrangian ( [ j30 ] ) , @xmath85 , so that the poisson brackets in these new variables read @xmath86 using ( [ j31 ] ) one easily finds that @xmath87 @xmath88      the characterization of the @xmath0-momentum space given in the previous subsection is ideally suited for the purposes of our relative - locality studies , but it leaves partly implicit the connection with the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra and its most popular applications in the study of spacetime noncommutativity . in order to expose more clearly this connection we shall now rederive the characterization of @xmath0-momentum space already given in the previous subsection taking as starting point the role of the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra in the study of the @xmath0-minkowski noncommutative spacetime@xcite .",
    "once again the selection of results we mention is due to the fact that the structure of the relative - locality framework of refs .",
    "@xcite , which we adopt , essentially requires some  inspiration \" for an on - shell relation , a law of conservation of momentum at interactions , and some poisson brackets . in this subsection",
