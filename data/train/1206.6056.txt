    "m dwarfs , with masses between @xmath70.08 and 0.6 m@xmath1 , are the most numerous and faintest main sequence stars in the galaxy .",

    "these stars are also well known for their high magnetic activity levels , characterized by frequent violent flaring outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and h@xmath8 emission @xcite .    eclipsing binary systems provide us with the valuable ability to directly measure the masses and radii of the two component stars .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the sample of known binary systems composed of two m dwarfs is very small .",
    "their intrinsically low luminosity and small radii conspire to make m dwarf binaries difficult to detect in variability surveys .",
    "the fraction of m dwarfs in binary systems is also much lower than for higher mass stars .",
    "@xcite has estimated that as few as @xmath710% of m dwarfs in the galactic field may be in binary ( or higher number ) configurations .",
    "the m dwarf binary and single - star systems that are well studied indicate that stellar structure models do not accurately predict the observed radii @xcite .",
    "radii are often observed to be @xmath71020% larger than predicted for a given mass .",
    "this may be due to limitations of the stellar models used , or to a fundamental difference in the interior structure of m dwarfs .",
    "magnetic activity is frequently identified as a potential culprit , causing the radii to be enlarged due to the inhibition of convection or decreased heat flux from magnetic spots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "long period m dwarf binaries ( @xmath9 days ) are ideal systems for radii determinations , as they are not influenced by spin  orbit coupling or tidal distortion @xcite .",
    "the above discrepancies will only be resolved by the addition of many accurately measured radii to the known sample over a wide range in mass and period .",
    "there also appears to be an absolute lower - limit on the orbital period for contact binary star systems , though no consensus about its origin has been reached .",
    "this short period limit at @xmath70.22 days may be due to both components being fully convective @xcite . at shorter periods",
    ", these stars can not adhere to their mass - radius relationship while simultaneously staying within the roche equipotential geometry .",
    "however , as @xcite points out , this does not appear to be the primary effect at work in creating the sharp 0.22 day period limit .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have shown that unstable mass transfer for low mass contact binaries may result in rapid coalescence .",
    "the observed period limit would thus be a result of the very short lifetimes for such systems .",
    "models of angular momentum loss in binary systems , however , indicate that even given favorable mass ratios and initial orbital periods , 6 - 13 gyr timescales are typically required for low mass binaries to obtain periods as short as 0.22 days @xcite .",
    "the observed period limit would then be a consequence of the finite age of the binary population .    until recently ,",
    "the shortest known m dwarf binary system period in the literature was bw3 v38 @xcite , a detached binary composed of two main sequence m3 dwarfs with an orbital period of 0.1984 days .",

    "additional medium to high resolution spectroscopic monitoring will allow us to differentiate h@xmath8 emission due to active surface regions from that of any nebular emission surrounding the system , as in ry scuti @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions between a binary system and other stars can decrease the binary orbital period through angular momentum transfer , or through three - body interactions @xcite . indeed the incidence of contact binary systems is higher in stellar clusters than in the field @xcite , due to the more frequent three - body interactions .",
    "recent models predict a timescale of 6 - 13 gyr for an isolated low - mass binary system to undergo enough angular momentum loss to evolve from a stable orbital period of @xmath71 - 2 days to below 0.22 days @xcite .",
    "estimates of angular momentum loss from single stars , applied to short period binary systems , show that magnetic braking takes on the order of a hubble time to compress these periods from 12 days to below the theoretical limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with their discovery of several low mass systems below the predicted 0.22 day limit",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that initial orbital periods must have been @xmath71 day in order for magnetic braking schemes to explain the short period systems .",
    "@xcite also show that the orbital evolutionary timescales and initial conditions for these rare short period binaries are still largely unconstrained , and that many possible mechanisms may be at work in forming such systems . once the stars reach a contact scenario , unstable mass transfer via the filled roche lobes , and mass loss through the outer lagrange points , predicts a rapid evolution towards coalescence @xcite .",
    "this type of over - contact evolution @xcite is thought to be a formation path for blue straggler stars in stellar clusters @xcite , and signatures include mass loss , changes in luminosity , and orbital decay .",
    "our measured period decay of approximately @xmath54 sec each year is larger than found for typical w uma binary systems .",
    "the largest amplitude period decay measured for a contact binary is that of v1309 sco , a merger system with an exponentially decreasing period with an amplitude of @xmath55300 sec year@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this system exhibited an extreme nova - like outburst , similar to v838 mon , as it underwent a catastrophic merging event in 2008 . assuming a linear period decay of @xmath56 seconds per year",
    ", we would expect sdss j001641 - 000925 to have a lifetime of @xmath710@xmath57 years .",
    "however , if the period evolution follows an exponential decay as in the higher mass v1309 sco system , the binary merger timescale may be as short as @xmath58 years .",
    "this amplitude of angular momentum loss required by the observed period decay ca nt be explained solely by magnetic braking , and the stars are too widely separated for gravitational waves to expel significant energy @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum loss is likely due to the system being in an over - contact configuration and having filled its critical roche surface , with mass being expelled from the outer lagrangian points .",
    "this would carry much more angular momentum from the system than magnetic breaking or winds alone , and would lead to a rapid coalescence into a single star @xcite .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility of mass transfer from the primary to the secondary star with little to no loss of angular momentum to the system .",
    "this mass redistribution could instead lead to a binary evolution as described by @xcite , with the orbital period increasing , and binary coalescence proceeding on a much more gradual nuclear or thermal timescale @xcite .",
    "our follow up study of the period evolution will help discern between these two possibilities .",
    "we emphasize the rarity of this system , as sdss j001641 - 000925 is the first true over - contact m dwarf binary known .",
    "the critical question remaining for the system is whether it is evolving rapidly towards coalescence due to the over - contact configuration .",
    "additional high precision follow - up photometry , as well as searching existing time domain surveys , is underway to conclusively determine whether the period is decaying at an exponential rate , as was the case for v1309 sco before its dramatic merger .",

    "<S> in addition , our photometry samples the system over 9 years , and we find strong evidence for period decay at the rate of @xmath58 s yr@xmath6 . both of these signatures raise the intriguing possibility that the system is in over - contact , and actively losing angular momentum , likely through mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> this places sdss j001641 - 000925 as not just the first m - dwarf over - contact binary , but one of the few systems of any spectral type known to be actively undergoing coalescence . </S>",
