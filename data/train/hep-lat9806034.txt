    "are the screening masses at finite temperatures .",
    "these are defined in general by the exponential spatial falloff of the correlation of two static sources .",
    "a classification of all masses is provided by the transformation properties of the sources . for glueball - like screening masses ,",
    "such a classification was performed in @xcite where the first measurements of several of these masses were reported .",
    "extensive lattice data is available on screening masses from meson and baryon - like sources @xcite , and on the correlation of polyakov lines .",
    "a gauge invariant transfer matrix formulation is easy to write for the lattice regularised theory . for thermal physics",
    ", it is convenient to think of the transfer matrix in a spatial direction .",
    "the free energy and other bulk thermodynamic quantities involve only the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix .",
    "correlation functions and the screening masses involve the ratio of this largest eigenvalue with specific other eigenvalues depending on the transformation properties of the source . thus , the full spectrum of screening masses contains much more information about the theory than bulk thermodynamics can provide .",
    "a quantity of special interest is the debye screening mass , @xmath4 , whose inverse gives the screening length of static choromo - electric fields . in the quantum theory ,",
    "this screening mass plays an important role in regulating some infra - red singularities .",
    "lattice measurements have , in the past , concentrated on measuring a mass from the correlation of polyakov loops , @xmath5 .",

    "many years ago nadkarni showed that the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is far from being so simple @xcite .",

    "reisz and collaborators @xcite wrote down a dimensionally reduced theory which could be used to define @xmath4 non - perturbatively .",
    "a recent paper @xcite used the representations of the symmetries of the transfer matrix to write down operators whose correlations could be used to measure the debye mass and @xmath4 was , in fact , first given in @xcite . ] and gave a general parametrisation of the perturbative and non - perturbative terms for @xmath4 .",
    "these parameters have since been determined in a lattice measurement of the debye screening mass using a dimensionally reduced theory at very high temperatures @xcite .",

    "it has been argued @xcite that a non - vanishing pole in magnetic gluon propagators is absent , and linde s problem is finessed by confinement in the three dimensional gauge theory .",
    "in fact , dimensional reduction has often been used to explore finite temperature theories @xcite , and it has long been argued that the dimensionally reduced theory is confining .",
    "the spatial string tension is known to be non - vanishing for @xmath13 and scales as @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the length scales @xmath16 , and hence can not be decoupled .",
    "the construction of @xcite is not applicable .",
    "however , the transfer matrix argument assures us that @xmath4 is only the smallest in a hierarchy of screening masses .",
    "we can then use the spectrum of the screening masses to explore the symmetries of the transfer matrix and check whether or not dimensional reduction works ; and if it does , then what is the nature of the reduced theory .",
    "our major result is that the degeneracies of the spectrum of screening masses implies that the symmetry group of the spatial transfer matrix is that of two dimensional rotations implying dimensional reduction for @xmath17 .",
    "the measured non - perturbative spectrum is similar to that in 3-d pure gauge theory @xcite .",

    "we will mention the group involved whenever we mention one of these irreps .    in the dimensionally reduced theory , the lattice symmetry group is @xmath63 .",

    "noise reduction involved a fuzzing procedure explained in appendix [ sc.fuzz ] . for each irrep of the symmetry group ,",
    "we projected the measured correlation function to the ground state by a variational technique explained in appendix [ sc.vary ] . successive measurements of correlation functions were separated by about one integrated auto - correlation time measured through the polyakov loop .",
    "one of the techniques for extracting screening masses from correlation functions in the long direction ( with @xmath85 sites ) is to solve the equation @xmath86\\over                  \\cosh\\left[m(z+1/2)(n_z/2-z)\\right ] }       \\;=\\ ; { c(z+1)\\over c(z ) } \\label{su3.local}\\ ] ] for the local mass , @xmath87 , given measurements of the correlation function @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "however , the intrinsic variability in the zero distance correlator is then redistributed over all the points through the covariance . the maximum distance retained in the fit",
    "was always determined by the criterion that the correlation function at that distance should be more than 1-@xmath96 from zero .",
