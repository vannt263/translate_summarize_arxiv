    "for a quantitative analysis of the spectrum measured from the background fluorescence by a grating spectrometer ( see figure [ fig : spec ] ) we performed a segmented fourier transformation on the data .",
    "we divided the set into wide segments and performed numerical fast fourier transformations on each of them individually .",
    "afterwards we matched the frequency amplitude ranges by normalizing the different segments to each other , colour coded the resulting profiles , and merged the different wavelength ranges to obtain the plot shown in figure [ fig : segfu ] .",
    "the different fourier components of the resonator s whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) are clearly visible as bands evenly spaced by an integer multiple of the lowest observable base frequency . this frequency component is directly related to 1/fsr and corresponds well with the theoretical estimated value based on the size of the discs .",
    "the black dotted lines are fits to this value and its different higher - order multiples .",

    "a laser was focussed on its rim .",
    "the spectra shown were acquired from bottom to top in equal timesteps of .",
    "after some steps the mode begins to shift .",
    "laser induced shifts of the resonance of resonators were previously observed by us  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "its physical or chemical origin is not understood yet , but it is assumed to be caused by a modification of the resonator s local shape or a change of the index of refraction of the resonators material .",
    "it is worth noting that tuning of the resonator is possible even without oxygen present .",
    "this is a very important feature , since it enables tuning of the resonator s whispering gallery modes to the zero phonon lines of the nitrogen vacancy centres .",
    "since no oxygen is needed for this procedure , it can be used in a cryostat at low temperatures .",
    "in addition to the possibility of tuning the resonances to lines of the optical emitters , it would be also possible to match resonances of different resonators and achieve controlled coupling among them .",
    "in the case of continuous excitation of an emitter with intensity @xmath6 , second order correlation functions @xmath7 and the quantum mechanically uncorrelated background of the intensity @xmath8 with @xmath9 , the joint second order correlation function is given by : @xmath10 by knowing the intensities @xmath11 and @xmath12 it one can calculate the @xmath7 function of the bare emitter @xmath11 from a measurement of the joint correlation function @xmath13 .    in case of pulsed excitation",
    "this background correction is more complicated , since the emission of emitter and background are correlated by the excitation laser .",
    "this problem can be avoided by only looking at time intervals corresponding to one laser period . in the analysis of an experiment s",
    "@xmath14-data acquired with a hanbury brown and twiss setup , this can be achieved by binning together all events in the time windows @xmath15 , with the laser repetition time @xmath16 ( @xmath17 in our experiment ) and @xmath18 being an integer .",
    "figure  [ fig : ab_correction ] a and b show the normalised coincidence counts measured with pulsed excitation at the location of an nv centre at the resonator s rim ( in a ) ) and at a location without an nv center next to it also on the rim ( in b ) ) , respectively .",
    "thus the data in figure  [ fig : ab_correction]a ) corresponds to coincidences from signal and background whereas figure  [ fig : ab_correction]b ) represents the background coincidences only .",
    "binning to intervals of was performed for better visibility .",
    "normalisation was done by averaging for long times ( @xmath19 over 256 periods ) , where contributions from the nv centre s bunching behaviour are negligible .",
    "also the photons normally missed in an hbt like start - stop configuration were taken into account .",
    "a comparison of the background photons rate with the intensity of the combined signal gave @xmath20 and @xmath21 , equivalent to a background to signal ratio of 2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ab_correction ] c shows the resulting corrected @xmath1 function , with bins sizes corresponding to the laser repetition time .",
    "for zero time delay @xmath22 .",
    "the error bar for this value stems from three contribution , with the main contribution stemming from the uncertainties in the ratio @xmath23 , which we assumed to be 10  % ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this error is due to the fact that background and signal were measured at neighboring positions on the resonator s rim , but not at the same one ( see figure 5 b of the main text , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the other two contributions are the statistical variations in the photon number for the zero time delay bin , which were both assumed to be possonian ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",

    "<S> the single photons are efficiently collected via resonators and routed in 3d through waveguides , all on one optical chip . </S>",
    "<S> our one - step fabrication scheme is easy to implement , scalable and flexible . </S>",
    "<S> thus , other complex assemblies of 3d quantum optical structures are feasible as well .    </S>",
    "<S> a fully integrated quantum optical technology requires active quantum systems incorporated into resonant optical microstructures and inter - connected in three dimensions via photonic wires . </S>",
    "<S> nitrogen vacancy - centres ( nv - centres ) in diamond which are excellent photostable room temperature single - photon emitters @xcite are ideal candidates for that purpose @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extensive research efforts to couple nv - centres to photonic structures such as optical microresonators @xcite , microcavities @xcite , and waveguides @xcite have been pursued . </S>",
    "<S> strategies for integration range from top - down fabrication via etching of diamond membranes @xcite to sophisticated bottom - up assembly of hybrid structures using diamond nanocrystals @xcite where the latter approach allows for deterministic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> recently , another approach based on the incorporation of nanodiamonds in soft glass optical fibres via a melting process has been introduced @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> we utilize two - photon direct laser writing ( dlw ) to fabricate fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) structures from a photoresist mixed with a solution of nanodiamonds containing nv - centres . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , this approach facilitates building integrated 3d quantum photonic elements of nearly arbitrary shapes .        on - chip photonic circuits working at </S>",
    "<S> the single - quantum level play an important role for future quantum information processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several approaches to assemble such quantum photonic devices from different fundamental photonic entities have been pursued @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by using self - assembled quantum dots in semiconductor membranes , one can exploit the full power of semiconductor nanofabrication technology , and sophisticated structures have been demonstrated @xcite , even with on - demand coupling architectures @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , this approach is limited to two - dimensional structures , except for few results obtained by extremely challenging manual membrane - stacking @xcite .    another easy and low - cost way of fabricating photonic structures is optical lithography via direct laser writing ( dlw ) @xcite where a tightly focussed femtosecond laser beam is used to expose a photoresist ( see figure [ fig : dlw]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the use of multi - photon absorption enables a sequential 3d exposure by scanning the sample or the focus of the laser . for common negative - tone photoresists , </S>",
    "<S> unexposed parts are removed during a development step and the 3d polymer structures remain ( see figure [ fig : dlw]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> dlw is well known for the fabrication of photonic crystals @xcite or other photonic elements like resonators @xcite and waveguides @xcite . in order to functionalise the structures with optically active material , fluorescent dyes @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and metal nanoparticles </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have been incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> however , until today there has been no 3d structure operating at the fundamental quantum level with single photons from single emitters being collected and routed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , no combinations of multiple optical elements ( different resonators , couplers , waveguides ) have been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the lack of photostable quantum emitters which are compatible with the dlw process while still preserving the possibility for high - quality dlw fabrication .      here , </S>",
    "<S> we overcome these obstacles by mixing small amounts of nanodiamonds from solution directly into a known photoresist @xcite ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this special photoresist allows for the fabrication of transparent optical elements made from an acrylate polymer containing nanodiamonds . </S>",
    "<S> the nanodiamonds contain nv - centres which are photostable even after exposure by the dlw laser . </S>",
    "<S> after the dlw process they serve as integrated single - photon sources . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially noteworthy that our technique is not limited to nv - centres in diamond nanocrystals . </S>",
    "<S> it can be applied to any photostable single - photon emitter in nanocrystalline material , e.g. other diamond defect centres , such as silicon vacancy - centres @xcite , or other deep defect centres in large band gap material @xcite .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the fabrication , functionality , and interaction of key building blocks for quantum photonic circuitry . </S>",
    "<S> these are interconnects ( i.e. , waveguides ) and functional elements like resonators and emitters . </S>",
    "<S> we measure single - photon emission from a diamond nanocrystal in a waveguide - coupled resonator which demonstrates the functional combination of all these building blocks and paves the way to more complex devices .    as a first component for integrated photonic circuits , disc resonators with a disc diameter of and a disc thickness of approximately on a stem with diameter </S>",
    "<S> were fabricated using the photoresist functionalised with nanocrystals ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonator supports whispering gallery modes which are confined in the disc close to the rim with high quality factors ( q - factors ) . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the q - factor using a tunable laser coupled into the resonator via a tapered fibre@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found q - factors as large as @xmath0 at a wavelength of around ( see figure [ fig : tapercoupling ] and methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed free spectral range of of the resonator corresponds well to the expected value of for a disc with diameter derived from geometrical considerations assuming an index of refraction of 1.5 .        </S>",
    "<S> next , a homebuilt confocal microscope ( see methods ) was used to raster scan the fabricated resonator discs ( see figure 3a ) and to identify single nv - centres by measuring the second - order autocorrelation function @xmath1 in a hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) interferometer . in parallel , </S>",
    "<S> a grating spectrometer was used to resolve the emission spectra of the individual emitters . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : diainresonator]b shows a confocal scan of a resonator where fluorescent defects can be identified as bright spots on the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> encircled is a spot on the resonator s outer rim where coupling to the disc s whispering gallery modes is expected . </S>",

    "<S> is observed reaching a value of @xmath2 ( standard error ) as deduced from the fit shown as red curve . </S>",
    "<S> no background correction was applied to these data . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement shows that the bright spot indeed corresponds to a single nv - centre in the disc resonator .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluorescence spectrum of an nv - centre at room temperature is typically broadened over from approx . to by phonon sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds well to the measured emission spectrum shown in figure [ fig : diainresonator]c . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at approximately stems from fluorescence of the photoresist and bleaches after long excitation . for confocal scans and correlation measurements this background light </S>",
    "<S> was suppressed by spectral filtering . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is a fine modulation of the spectrum due to the cavity resonances . </S>",
    "<S> it is attributed to photons that were initially emitted into the resonator modes and afterwards scattered out by the diamond nanocrystal . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these photons are detected in addition to the flat unmodulated spectrum emitted directly out of the disc .        as a second photonic element , arc waveguides from the same material with a width of and a length of were built . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguides were fabricated close to the disc resonator in order to enable evanescent coupling to the resonator s modes ( see figure [ fig : waveguide]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> their ability to guide light within a broad spectral range is demonstrated by illuminating one end of the waveguide with light from a halogen lamp as seen in figures [ fig : waveguide]b and c. the blue and red circular spots correspond to the input and output of the arc waveguide , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> coupling via the waveguides to the resonator modes was confirmed by shining an excitation laser ( wavelength of ) into one port of the waveguide and , after blocking excitation light by a dichroic mirror , analysing the light coming out of the other port . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the -laser excites background fluorescence in the resonator , which is then coupled back into the waveguide . the measured fluorescence spectrum in figure [ fig : waveguide]e thus shows the characteristic modulation by resonator modes and proves a good coupling between guided modes in the arc waveguide and confined modes in the resonator ( see supplementary information ) .        by moving the excitation spot of a second objective over a waveguide </S>",
    "<S> ( see figure [ fig : waveguide]a ) , individual nanodiamonds inside can be addressed and identified as spots with higher fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity cross correlation between the waveguide s two outputs shows a clear antibunching behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> this result highlights a way of coupling single emitters to thin waveguides , which can possess very high collection efficiencies , as demonstrated recently using tapered optical fibres @xcite . here , we show a direct on - chip integration of such devices with both waveguide ends accessible . </S>",
    "<S> detection at the waveguide s ends can yield count rates of after passing a 50/50 beam splitter and spatial and spectral filtering . </S>",
    "<S> the autocorrelation function at zero time delay of the fluorescence collected in this way is @xmath3 ( standard error ) showing the single - photon character of the light ( see figure [ fig : waveguide]g ) . when accounting for the 50/50 beam splitter , at high excitation powers the number of background corrected counts from the defect centre is measured to be .        </S>",
    "<S> finally , we verified active quantum functionality of a coupled 3d system , i.e. , single photon emission to resonator modes , as well as subsequent collection and routing via a coupled waveguide . in order to do so </S>",
    "<S> , raster scans of the excitation spot over the resonator disc were performed while the photons from one of the waveguide s ends are collected ( see figure [ fig : res16dia]a ) . when the excitation laser hits the outer rim of the resonator , the created fluorescence light is coupled to the resonator modes and subsequently out to the waveguide , as can bee seen in figure [ fig : res16dia]b . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the outer rim of the resonator appears bright in the raster image . </S>",
    "<S> bright spots indicate possible positions of nv - centres . to identify nv - centres via their non - classical light emission , </S>",
    "<S> an hbt setup , with the laser - written arc waveguide serving as beam splitter , is used . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : res16dia]b shows this correlation measurement for the nv - centre encircled in figure [ fig : res16dia]a . </S>",
    "<S> the data shown were acquired with a pulsed laser at repetition rate and background corrected ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath4 ( standard deviation ) is far below the threshold @xmath5 for having equal contributions of two centers and proves that the main contribution to the signal stems from a single nv - centre . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that the nv - centre emits single photons into resonator modes , which are then coupled out and redirected by the arc waveguide . with a single source in a resonator coupled to a waveguide , </S>",
    "<S> this device represents a key integrated 3d quantum photonic circuit .      in conclusion , we have shown an approach which allows for the direct incorporation of single quantum emitters into true 3d photonic structures of nearly arbitrary shape . the one step fabrication scheme is easy to implement and requires no elaborate clean - room environment . </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out that our method is not limited to nv - centres in nanodiamond , but can be extended to any other stable quantum emitter embedded in nanocrystals . </S>",
    "<S> the flexibility of dlw enables immediate scaling - up to more complex structures ( see figure [ fig : dlw]b ) where single photons are collected , sent through beam splitters , interferometers , or other optical elements inter - connected by waveguides in a 3d architecture </S>",
    "<S> . also tree - dimensional multi - arm quantum interferometers  * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * can be implemented . </S>",
    "<S> tuning of individual components , e.g. the resonator , is possible as well ( see supplementary information ) . with ( partial ) metallisation of the structures embedding single photon emitters in 3d plasmonic structures or in metamaterials @xcite can be envisioned . </S>",
    "<S> a next challenging , but rewarding step is to perform dlw of perfectly aligned 3d structures around emitters of known position . </S>",
    "<S> this would enable on - demand fabrication of arbitrary 3d quantum photonic architectures .      </S>",
