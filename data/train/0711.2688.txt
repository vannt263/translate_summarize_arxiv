    "much of the nucleus is obscured by high levels of patchy dust extinction up to @xmath11 mag @xcite .",
    "radio - wave continuum and recombination line studies have revealed a dominant luminous ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) , compact ( r=1 pc ) , young ( @xmath14 myr ) star cluster that appears to be gravitationally bound and potentially destined to evolve into a globular cluster @xcite .",

    "@xcite studied the star formation history of ngc  5253 and determined that the light was dominated by a young component with an age between 10@xmath20 and 10@xmath21 yrs .",
    "recent studies have concluded that all of the uv - selected star clusters in ngc  5253 have estimated ages @xmath2220 myr , indicating that either the star formation episode began very recently or else that the timescale for dynamical disruption of star clusters is very short @xcite .",
    "the overall gas - phase metallicity of ngc  5253 is 12+@xmath23 ( about 1/4 solar ) , but some of the central regions contain an excess of nitrogen , consistent with local `` pollution '' from wolf - rayet star winds @xcite .    when observed at low resolution , the distribution and kinematics of its neutral interstellar medium suggest that the  in ngc  5253 either rotates about the minor axis or flows radially along the minor axis @xcite . @xcite and @xcite report the @xmath24 detection of molecular gas clouds having kinematics consistent with infall along the minor axis dust lane",
    ". these peculiar gas kinematics may hold clues to the mechanism that triggered the present burst of star formation .",
    "in this paper we present 21-cm aperture synthesis observations from the national radio astronomy observatory s _ very large array _ ( vla ) and the parkes 64 m radio telescope to investigate the conditions in the interstellar medium that have produced such extreme star formation .",
    "ngc  5253 is an ideal environment to seek the causes of extreme star formation because the burst is so young and , presumably , feedback from the energetic star clusters has not yet had a dramatic impact on the surrounding ism .",
    "the distance to ngc  5253 is somewhat controversial and has been measured in many studies including @xcite ( 4.1 @xmath250.5 mpc ) , @xcite ( 3.3@xmath26 mpc ) , @xcite ( 3.25@xmath250.2 mpc ) , @xcite ( 3.9@xmath250.5 mpc ) , @xcite ( 4.0@xmath250.3 mpc ) , and @xcite ( 3.8 @xmath250.2 mpc ) .",
    "the distances based on cepheid variables strongly depend on the sample selection @xcite and so we prefer the trgb distance of 3.8 mpc @xcite which implies an angular scale of 18.4 pc arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "ngc  5253 was observed in the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen using the @xmath27 for approximately 6 hours in the bna configuration on 1995",
    "september 25 , 3 hours in the cnb configuration on 1996 january 28 , and 2 hours in the dnc configuration on 1996 june 10 .",
    "the 2if correlator configuration with hanning smoothing yielded a total bandwidth of 1.56 mhz ( 327 km s@xmath5 ) and 128 12.2 khz ( 2.58 km s@xmath5 ) spectral channels .",
    "intermittent observations of the compact radio source 1316 - 336 were used to phase calibrate the data , and observations of 3c286 were used for flux calibration .",
    "the data were reduced with nrao s @xmath28 package following standard procedures for editing bad time ranges and performing phase , flux , and bandpass calibrations .",
    "the radio continuum flux was subtracted in the uv plane using offline channels to produce a continuum - free 21-cm line uv dataset .",
    "data from each configuration were calibrated separately , and then the uv data were combined after subtracting continuum .",
    "these combined data were then used to map the emission from the 1420 mhz transition of neutral hydrogen with greatly enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity compared to the 45-minute dnc configuration observations presented by @xcite .",
    "the uv data were mapped to the image plane at two different resolutions and cleaned @xcite with resulting clean synthesized beamsizes of 9.0@xmath297.6and 17@xmath2915  to emphasize both the small scale structures and diffuse  features , respectively .",
    "the rms noise levels in these maps are 1.2 mjy beam@xmath5 and 1.7 mjy beam@xmath5 , respectively , slightly larger than the theoretical noise of 1.0 mjy .",
    "because the angular extent of  in ngc  5253 ( @xmath30 ; @xcite ) is much smaller than the @xmath27 primary beam size at 21 cm , no primary beam correction was applied .",
    "the low - resolution cube was used as a template in which regions having emission exceeding 2@xmath31 in at least two adjacent channels were marked .",
    "the low resolution cube was then used to blank the higher resolution cube on a channel - by - channel basis outside the areas of probable emission .",
    "this approach preserves low - level 12 @xmath31 emission peaks , many of them real , in the final high - resolution data cube used for subsequent analysis .",
    "ngc  5253 was observed with the parkes 64 m radio telescope in the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen on 1997 february 12 using a total bandwidth of 8 mhz ( 1600 km s@xmath5 ) and 2048 channels of 0.0039 mhz ( 0.82 km s@xmath5 ) centered at @xmath32 km",
    "the primary beam angular diameter is 16 .",
    "we interleaved on - band spectra with frequency - switched off - band spectra centered at @xmath33 km s@xmath5  to obtain emission - free  profiles .",
    "a 9-pointing ( 3x3 ) grid with 14  spacings centered on ngc  5253 was used to search for extended emission surrounding ngc  5253 , but only the central position showed a strong 21-cm detection .",
    "the data for left and right circular polarizations were reduced by subtracting the frequency - switched reference spectrum from the source and fitting a low - order polynomial to remove any residual baseline .",
    "the system temperature averaged 33 k and the mean rms noise in the resulting spectra is 0.06 k per channel .",

    "one can appreciate the asymmetry in the field .",
    "redshifted  gas extends out to 50 km s@xmath5  from the systemic velocity , while blueshifted gas extends out only 30 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the second notable component is the gas at roughly the systemic velocity showing a slow drift in central velocity across the spatial distribution with an amplitude of roughly 20 km s@xmath5 , consistent with that expected for such a low - mass galaxy .",

    "here we again see a large range in velocities over a relatively small spatial extent .",
    "it is interesting that in this projection , the gas appears continuous in velocity from the extreme of the redshifted gas to the extreme of the blueshifted gas .",
    "here we will try to draw a coherent picture of the three major components of the  distribution : the  associated with the stellar distribution , the southeast  plume , and the open shells to the west and east .",
    "it is interesting to compare these new  observations of ngc  5253 to those of ngc  625 @xcite , another dwarf starburst galaxy at a similar distance .",
    "@xcite showed that ngc  625 also has the dominant  velocity gradient along the _ minor _ axis .",
    "@xcite showed that this large velocity gradient was due to outflowing  gas from the central starburst .",
    "this outflowing gas is also detected in the warm and hot phases of the ism @xcite .",
    "this similarity with ngc  625 motivates a second look at the  component in ngc  5253 that is aligned with the optical galaxy . in ngc  625 ,",
    "the signature of rotation along the major axis was swamped by the presence of the strong  outflow . however , the position velocity diagrams revealed the low amplitude rotation curve present in the .",
    "it is probable that we are seeing the same effect in ngc  5253 .",
    "although the  in ngc  5253 is quite disturbed , the overall trend for higher velocities in the southwest and lower velocities in the northeast suggest a pattern of rotation .",
    "this is also seen in the stellar velocities measured by @xcite ( their figure 10 ) and the h@xmath0 major - axis velocity map of @xcite ( her figure 9 ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to calculate the expected amplitude of the rotation curve for ngc  5253 ; comparing to the luminosity requires a significant correction for the small m / l ratio expected for a starburst galaxy .",
    "nonetheless , after applying a small ( @xmath69 20% ) correction for inclination , the amplitude of @xmath1 10 km s@xmath5  is not out of line with what could be expected for ngc  5253 .",
    "note that the  study of the similar dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1569 by @xcite also found only small evidence of normal rotation in the inner parts of ngc  1569 , but that the  along the major axis in the outer parts confirmed this rotation signature .",
    "these new high resolution  observations preclude rotation along the minor axis as a viable interpretation for the southeast plume .",
    "either inflow , outflow , or some kind of tidal interaction remnant feature seem more likely . based on co observations , @xcite favored infall of metal poor gas .",
    "the radial velocities of the co clouds @xmath1200 pc east of the nucleus are slightly higher than the systemic velocity , consistent with inflow or possibly rotation about the major axis within the innder few hundred pc .",
    "the  velocities at this location could also be consistent with major - axis rotation within the nuclear regions .",
    "many galaxies are known to have counter - rotating or decoupled dynamical components in the inner regions , and close grvitational interactions are often invoked as the causes of such kinematics .    that an accretion event may have triggered the current starburst",
    "has been suggested several times @xcite .",
    "@xcite identify three points in favor of the infall hypothesis .",
    "first , the weak co emission associated with a strong starburst favors low metallicity gas .",
    "second , the non - central position of the co suggests a transient feature .",
    "third , the redshift of the co relative to the galaxian systemic velocity could be indicative of inflow . @xcite",
    "further note that since the dust lane that is associated with the co and  emission in the southeast plume appears to be in front of the galaxy , the geometry ( redshift ) favors infall .",
    "a close look at the relative locations of the co clouds , dust lane , and  peaks along the southeast minor axis reveals , in fact , two different gaseous components in this direction .",
    "these two components are resolved both spatially and kinematically by the new  observations , and a comparison with the extinction maps of @xcite shows that these are intrinsically different components  not two maxima of the same feature .",

    "the inferred extinctions range from @xmath73 near zero to @xmath74 .",
    "the cross and ellipses show the locations of the central thermal radio supernebula and the co clouds , as in previous figures .",
    "contours in figure  [ av ] show the extinction derived from the neutral hydrogen column densities assuming a galactic ratio of gas to dust @xcite ,    @xmath75    for a standard galactic ratio of total to selection extinction , @xmath76 , this is equivalent to ,    @xmath77    here , we have ignored , for the moment , any contribution from molecular gas , and we remind the reader that the  column densities inferred from the high - resolution interferometer maps may be underestimates of the true column densities by up to a factor of two , owing to the insensitivity of the @xmath27 to emission on large angular scales . hence , the estimated  column densities and extinctions are lower limits .",
    "the contours in figure  [ av ] correspond to @xmath784 , 3.5 , 3 , 2.5 , 2 , 1.5 , 1 and 0.5 mag .",
    "figure  [ av ] shows that the extended region of high extinction indicated by the balmer decrement coincides with a local maximum in the neutral hydrogen column density and the locus of the positions of the co detections .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 in this region @xmath80 , consistent with the expectation that some of the  lies behind the region of ionized gas , and with the expectation that some of the diffuse  may be unseen in the interferometer maps .",
    "more precise estimates are not possible because of the large disparity in beamsize between the @xmath27  data ( 8) and the @xcite @xmath81 maps ( 0.3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation between both extinction measures at this location is consistent with the majority of the  ( and molecular gas ? ) lying in the foreground of the ionized medium . the high  column density in this feature probably continues into the region surrounding the central radio supernebula and super star cluster , but measurements are unreliable at this location owing to the strong  absoprtion .",
    "by contrast , the maximum  column density , corresponding to @xmath82 mag , is located in the  plume @xmath115  to the southwest of the region with the largest @xmath73 . at this location",
    "there is no pronounced peak in @xmath73 and there are no co detections .",
    "figure  [ greypanels ] shows that the gas responsible for this primary peak in n ( ) occurs at velocities @xmath83",
    "km s@xmath5  and is kinematically and spatially distinct from the neutral gas at the location of the molecular clouds . _ thus , what we are calling the  plume appears to have no physical relation to the region of high extinction in the dust lane _",
    ", with the possible exception of a tenuous connection at velocities @xmath84 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the very high ratio of  column density to extinction in the plume implies that either the plume gas is located on the far side of ngc  5253 , or that the gas is extremely metal - poor and has a very large gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the metal - poor ism in dwarf galaxies does exhibit gas - to - dust ratios 25 times higher than in the milky way @xcite , so equation  [ dustgas ] could require a correction factor of this order .",
    "however , the mean ratio @xmath85 in the vicinity of the plume compared to @xmath86 near the dust lane suggests that the plume and the dust lane are distinct entities . even if we allow that , statistically , half of the neutral medium may lie behind the star - forming ionized gas , the inferred extinctions are factors of 23 larger from the  column density than from the balmer decrement",
    ". the real ratio may be even larger because , as described above , the  column density estimates should be regarded as lower limits and a molecular component is not included .",
    "the true nature of this low - extinction , high - column - density , redshifted  plume is difficult to pin down .",
    "one possible explanation is that the  plume may be outflowing gas such as commonly observed in dwarf starbursts like ngc  1705 @xcite and ngc  625 @xcite .",
    "the main difference between ngc  5253 and ngc  625 is the asymmetry of the  distribution seen here .",
    "the symmetrical  distribution in ngc  625 was taken as strong evidence against infall of gas , but the  plume in ngc  5253 does not show a similar symmetry .",
    "figure  [ lvminor ] shows that there is continuity from the strongly redshifted gas ( @xmath1 + 50 km s@xmath5 ) through to blueshifted gas ( @xmath1 @xmath5730 km s@xmath5 ) , which would be the signature of somewhat asymmetric outflow .",
    "the `` spur '' of outflowing gas in ngc  1705 is one - sided , and @xcite note that this is to be expected when the source of the outflow is displaced relative to the midplane @xcite .",
    "however , the plume in ngc  5253 contains 2030% of the seen in the interferometer maps , depending on the spatial and velocity boundaries adopted .",
    "such a fractionally massive outflow of neutral gas over a fairly small solid angle without any ionized gas counterpart makes the outflow interpretation less plausible in this galaxy .",
    "radial inflow , suggested by @xcite on the basis of the kinematics of co clouds within the minor axis dust lane , is another possibility .",
    "the geometry of the isovelocity contours in the redshifted  plume can help distinguish whether the inflow could be on the near or far side of ngc  5253 .",
    "the most redshifted contours ( 455 km s@xmath5 ) lie farthest from the galaxy and are @xmath150 km s@xmath5  larger than the systemic velocity of 400 km s@xmath5 .",
    "an infalling stream is expected to accelerate as it approaches the galaxy .",
    "thus , if the plume were infalling gas on the _ near _ side , the isovelocity contours closer to the galaxy ought to exceed 455 km s@xmath5 .",
    "instead , we observe that they approach the systemic velocity .",
    "inflow from the _ far _ side of ngc  5253 might , however , produce the observed signature .",
    "such a background geometry would simultaneously explain the lack of extinction seen toward the high column density peaks in the plume .    finally , and perhaps most plausibly , the  plume may be a kinematically distinct remnant from a recent gravitational interaction with another member of the centarus a subgroup of the centarus a / m  83 complex .",
    "it is difficult to prove or rule out this possibility . in this scenario ,",
    "the  asymmetry is easily understood as a chance projection against the main body of ngc  5253 , and there is no need for the tidal tail to be symmetrically placed in either space or velocity .",
    "the galaxy density within the centarus a subgroup is high , and interactions are to be expected .",
    "many of these systems are dynamically disturbed systems , suggestive of a history fraught with close encounters .",
    "a perturbing , but not destructive , close encounter would simultaneously provide an explanation for the  plume as a tidal feature and provide a cause for the recent burst of star formation seen throughout the galaxy , most exceptionally in the nucleus .",

    "( 2007 ) have provided a three dimensional picture of the cen a / m83 complex , and ngc  5253 is located in the periphery . using radial velocities and accurately measured distances , karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have identified ngc  5253 with the cen a sub - group based on a positive tidal index .",
    "this is because , even though ngc  5253 is within 2 degrees of m  83 in projection on the sky , it is 1.4 mpc closer than m83 and nearly identical in distance to cen a. note , however , that ngc  5253 is separately by roughly 12 degrees in projection from cen a , corresponding to roughly 800 kpc .",
    "thus ngc  5253 is currently far from the strong gravitational influence of either of the largest galaxies in the complex . despite being",
    "a member of a very populous complex , ngc  5253 appears to be relatively isolated .",
    "in fact , the next nearest known galaxy , eso 383 - 087 , appears to be over 400 kpc away .",
    "it is not clear which member of the group might have interacted recently with ngc  5253 .    in some ways ,",
    "the  plume in ngc  5253 is reminiscent of some of the extended filaments of gas surrounding ic  10 @xcite or the giant  cloud in virgo ,  1225 + 0146 @xcite . in ic  10 ,",
    "`` plumes '' and `` streamers '' have velocity gradients that show little relation to the overall rotation of the galaxy .",
    "the true nature of the extended  features in ic  10 is also not yet understood , but interaction with these  features is generally thought to have provoked the present starburst .",
    "@xcite finds that starbursting dwarf galaxies like ngc  5253 are found preferentially to have close companions , so the interaction hypothesis is a reasonable one .",
    "one very important point is that the large range of velocities observed in the  in ngc  5253 is associated with the southeast plume .",
    "it is common practice in the literature to apply the fwhm of the gas velocity distribution as indicative of internal dynamics to estimate dynamical mass @xcite or a stellar crossing time @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether the large - scale velocity gradient seen in the  plume is due to infall , outflow , or tidal debris , the resulting large velocity dispersion should not be used as an internal dynamical indicator .",
    "the main question concerning the open shells on the west and the east is whether those shells represent events centered at the currently indicated positions or if they are also the result of centrally energized outflows that give rise to shell geometries as they emerge from the galaxy .",
    "the centers of the western and eastern open shells lie well outside of the main stellar distribution and far from the current , centrally concentrated star formation .",
    "comparison with simulations of outflows @xcite and real outflows observed in h@xmath0 and x - rays @xcite show that open - shell morphologies can be created where the centers of the shells are far from the source of the energy .",
    "is it possible that this is what we are seeing in ngc  5253 ?",
    "how likely is it that star formation events capable of creating large  shells could have occurred on the periphery of the present stellar distribution ?",
    "our view of the spatially resolved star formation history of ngc  5253 has evolved with time @xcite .",
    "the most recent work by @xcite emphasizes the very young ages ( @xmath69 20 myr ) for all of the clusters that they studied ( in agreement with the work by * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite required detection in the uv for inclusion , so their sample should be strongly biased toward the youngest clusters ( only the brightest of the older clusters would be detected - see their figure 15 ) .",
    "the earlier study by @xcite derived ages of order 50 myr for some of the clusters , the colors of the core required starburst activity within the last 100 myr , and @xcite deduced a range in cluster ages with an upper limit of 10@xmath21 years . from the above ,",
    "it is not clear whether strong star formation events in the periphery of its stellar distribution in the recent past are consistent with the star formation history of ngc  5253 . a star formation history derived from the field stars , while challenging owing to the distance and the presence of differential extinction",

    "the shell has an angular diameter of @xmath145  or about 830 pc .",

    "the mass of neutral hydrogen in this feature is @xmath87 m@xmath3  as measured by summing emission in the high - resolution data cube from this feature .",

    "the velocity range ( 30 km s@xmath5 ) of the  near this h@xmath0 shell is comparable to that found in the ionized gas , consistent with slow or stalled expansion .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission inside this bubble @xcite is also consistent with it being an older , cooler , quiescent remnant from bygone era of star formation .",
    "if we take the mass of the  bubble to be @xmath89 m@xmath3  and the radial expansion speed to be 20 km s@xmath5 the kinetic energy contained in this structure is @xmath90 erg .",
    "the implied expansion timescale for this @xmath11 kpc diameter structure is @xmath2240 myr , making it unlikely that the current 3 myr old burst produced this bubble .",

    "we have discussed three possible origins for the  plume : outflowing gas , inflowing gas , and a separate  cloud which is interacting with ngc  5253 .",
    "the possibility of outflow was motivated by similarity with velocity fields observed in other dwarf starburst galaxies showing  outflow ( e.g. , ngc 1569 , ngc 625 , ngc 1705 ) .",
    "however , the large fraction of  ( @xmath12325% ) in the anamalous velocity gas in ngc  5253 is exceptional .",
    "furthermore , strong outflows are usually accompanied by h@xmath0 and x - ray emission which is not observed at this location .",
    "such a massive outflow confined to a small solid angle without corresponding signatures in the ionized gas seems unlikely .",
    "the possibility of inflow was motivated by the radial velocities of co clouds within the minor - axis dust lane @xcite .",
    "our high resolution  observations indicate that the plume is a kinematically distinct feature from the associated with the molecular gas .",
    "the most compelling argument for inflow is the near coincidence in velocity of the plume with the galaxy s systemic velocity in the region where the two are spatially coincident .",
    "if the  plume is infalling , it must be from the far side of ngc  5253 given the plume s velocity field ( i.e. , the most redshifted gas lies farthest from the galaxy ) , consistent with the lack of extinction observed in this vicinity despite the high  column density .",

    "a recent gravitational encounter , perhaps with another dwarf galaxy in the same group , produced the  plume and provided the trigger for the current extreme burst of star formation .",
    "other dwarf galaxies , both bursting and non - bursting are accompanied by pure structures . given the relatively large gas mass associated with the  plume , this would appear to be the most likely explanation .      our high resolution view of ngc  5253 has shown us that ngc  5253 has many similarities to the best studied dwarf starburst galaxies .",
    "concentrations near the minor axis dust lane are coincident in location and velocity with at least two of the molecular clouds seen in @xmath124co @xcite .",
    "the extension to the south - southeast , designated here the plume , appears to be spatially and kinematically distinct from the gaseous medium surrounding the dust lane molecular clouds along the southeast minor axis .",
    "we present evidence that the redshifted  plume is likely to be either a dynamically distinct tidal remnant or an inflow on the far side of the galaxy .",
    "extensions to the east , west , and southwest show remarkably similar morphologies as the h@xmath0 shells and filaments .",
    "in particular , there is a close morphological similarity between the `` quiescent '' h@xmath0 shell to the west of the nucleus noted by @xcite and an 800 pc diameter shell - like feature seen in .",
    "this may be an example of a starburst - powered shell stalled by the mass of surrounding neutral gas .    these complex  features and kinematic signatures , when considered together with distributions of the molecular , ionized , and hot coronal media , are consistent with a starbursting low - mass galaxy in the initial phases of generating a galactic wind .",
    "unlike more massive galaxies such as m  82 or ngc  3079 which show monolithic , well - collimated outflows several non - co - spatial star formation events over the last @xmath125 myr appear to be required to explain the multiple outflows observed in ngc  5253 @xcite .",

    "<S> _ very large array _ and parkes 64 m radiotelescope 21-cm observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy ngc  5253 reveal a multi - component non - axisymmetric  distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the component associated with the stellar body shows evidence for a small amount of rotational support aligned with the major axis , in agreement with optically measured kinematics and consistent with the small galaxian mass . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 2030% of the  emission is associated with a second component , an  `` plume '' extending along the optical minor axis to the southeast . </S>",
    "<S> we consider outflow , inflow , and tidal origins for this feature . </S>",
    "<S> outflow appears improbable , inflow is a possibility , and tidal debris is most consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , kinematics of the  that include this feature are not indicative of the dynamical mass or the local velocity dispersion of the cold gas . </S>",
    "<S> these  observations also reveal a filamentary third component that includes an 800 pc diameter  shell or bubble to the west of the nucleus , coinciding with an h@xmath0 shell </S>",
    "<S> . the mass of  in the shell may be as large as @xmath1@xmath2 m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this large mass , coupled with the lack of expansion signatures in the neutral and ionized gas ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) , suggests that this feature may be an example of a starburst - blown bubble stalled by interaction with a massive neutral envelope . </S>",
    "<S> many other  kinematic features closely resemble those seen in h@xmath0 emission from the ionized gas , supporting the interpretation of neutral and ionized gas outflow at velocities of @xmath130 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison between extinction estimates from the balmer emission - line decrement and the  column densities suggest a gas - to - dust ratio 23 times the galactic value in this low - metallicity ( @xmath6 ) galaxy . </S>"
