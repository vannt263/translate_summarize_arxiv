    "_ @xcite , are possible _ on the brane _ in the randall and sundrum model @xcite in which the three spatial dimensions that we experience are a 3 dimensional brane embedded in a 4 + 1 dimensional space - time .",
    "the effective 3 + 1 dimensional einstein field equations on the brane for the randall and sundrum model were derived by shiromizu , maeda , and sasaki @xcite .",
    "gravity on the brane is prevented from _ leaking _ into the extra dimension at low energies by a negative bulk cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this negative cosmological constant can be offset by a positive brane tension such that there is a zero cosmological constant on the brane . in the case of a gravitational geon solution in which",
    "no matter is present , there would nevertheless be a generally non - zero effective energy - momentum tensor induced on the brane corresponding to    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a 4-dimensional projection of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor @xmath4 , @xmath5 is normal to the brane and @xmath6 is the induced metric on the brane @xcite .    in their investigation of black holes on the brane , dadhich ,",
    "maartens , papadopoulos and rezania showed that the reissner - nordstrom metric is an exact solution to the effective 3 + 1 dimensional einstein field equations on the brane and can be interpreted as a black hole without electric charge but with a _ tidal charge _ that arises from the solution to the einstein field equations in 4 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "they further showed that , in the induced metric for their exact black hole solution , the free gravitational field in the bulk contributes a negative effective energy density on the brane and tends to strengthen the gravitational field .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the free gravitational field in the bulk modifies the gravitational field on the brane so that gravitational geons are possible on the brane .",
    "our approach is to look at a specific static , spherically symmetric solution of the form @xmath7    for this metric , the 4 dimensional ricci scalar on the brane is given by @xcite @xmath8    where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to r.    our approach is to choose @xmath9 and solve @xmath10 in ( [ introduction:2 ] ) for @xmath11 .",
    "substituting a solution to @xmath10 into the einstein field equations for 3 + 1 dimensional general relativity gives a trace free energy - momentum tensor    @xmath12    that satisfies    @xmath13    for a vacuum solution on the brane , the projection of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor ( [ introduction:14 ] ) satisfies @xcite    @xmath14    allowing us to make the correspondence @xmath15 and treat @xmath10 along with equations ( [ introduction:17 ] ) and ( [ introduction:18 ] ) as a closed system of equations on the brane .",

    ". we can therefore say that the sign of @xmath119 depends on @xmath97 but not on @xmath71 individually .",
    "having determined how the choice of @xmath97 affects the behaviour of @xmath44 and @xmath120 at each zero of @xmath74 , we looked at each distinct range of @xmath97 values considering both @xmath113 and @xmath121 solutions .",
    "for each case , we sought to determine if our solution corresponds to gravitational geons .",
    "for these values of @xmath97 , @xmath74 has no zeros .",
    "consequently , all solutions with @xmath122 correspond to gravitational geons . choosing @xmath123 we confirmed the behavior of @xmath124 using iterative numerical analysis ( see fig.[fig : a_no_critical_point ] ) .",
    "also evident is the progression from the weak field solution for @xmath57 ( fig.[fig : weak_a ] ) to the piecewise constructed solution for @xmath125 ( fig.[fig : a_1.189 ] ) which we discuss in the following section .      at the first zero of @xmath74 ,",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 for values of @xmath97 in this range .",
    "there is therefore no singular behaviour and no horizon indicated at the corresponding spherical hypersurface .",

    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 at the second zero .",
    "consequently , no singular behaviour or horizon is indicated .",
    "whereas our analysis of the kretshmann scalar shows the possibility of solutions corresponding to gravitational geons with @xmath113 at the second zero , instability at each zero prevents us from confirming any particular solution using iterative methods ( see fig.[fig : a_direction_plot ] ) .",
    "however , we have been able to confirm that @xmath129 and @xmath130 around each zero for each section constructed numerically ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : a_1.189_firstforward ] , [ fig : a_1.189_secondbackward ] , [ fig : a_1.189_secondforward ] ) .",
    "we piecewise constructed @xmath44 around each zero of @xmath74 using the numerically constructed sections ( see fig.[fig : a_1.189 ] ) .",
    "the resulting solution is _ sewn together _ at the spherical hypersurfaces corresponding to each zero .",

    "@xmath132 is the extrinsic curvature of the surface , @xmath133 , @xmath134 is the induced metric on the surface and @xmath135 denotes the jump in @xmath132 across the surface .",
    "now , @xmath132 depends on the metric and its first derivatives @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath136 are all continuous in our piecewise constructed solution , there will be a non - vanishing @xmath137 only if @xmath120 is discontinuous across either hypersuface corresponding to a zero of @xmath138 .",
    "our analysis shows that @xmath120 is continuous implying that @xmath139 .",
    "it should be noted that there could be contributions to @xmath137 from the weyl term ( [ introduction:14 ] ) . if that were the case , @xmath139 in our piecewise constructed solution would imply that there is a localized gravitational source ( such as matter ) at the hypersurface and the stresses contributed by each cancel one another exactly . since the space - time off the brane is not known , it is not possible to check to see if such contributions exist .    if there are no contributions to @xmath137 from the weyl tensor , the piecewise constructed solutions correspond to gravitational geons .",
    "our analysis shows that the kretshmann scalar diverges at the spherical hypersurfaces corresponding to the zeros of @xmath74 for values of @xmath109 .",
    "we have therefore determined that solutions that correspond to gravitational geons do not exist for these values of @xmath97 .",
    "in the range @xmath140 , divergence of the kretshmann scalar rules out the possibility of gravitational geon solutions , except in the special case that @xmath113 at both zeros of @xmath74 .",
    "however , direction field plots indicate that these solutions are inconsistent with our boundary conditions .    as discussed in the previous section , gravitational geon solutions",
    "are again ruled out by divergence of the kretshmann scalar in the range @xmath125 , except in the special case that @xmath113 at the second zero of @xmath74 .",
    "there are therefore no solutions that correspond to gravitational geons possible for @xmath141 with the exception of @xmath113 at the second zero of @xmath74 for @xmath125 .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a particular static , spherically symmetric 3 + 1 dimensional space - time for behaviour consistent with that of gravitational geons on a brane embedded in a 4 + 1 dimensional space - time . in the absence of a general solution , we investigated the behaviour of the space - time using a variety of methods and were able to ascertain that , for a particular set of parameter choices , gravitational geons are possible .",
    "the significance of the result presented in this paper is that , in general , for brane - world space - times gravitational geons are possible .",
    "we investigated solutions in the weak field limit and showed that gravitational geons will exist as long as @xmath142 is small for all @xmath28 .",
    "we also investigated the specific function @xmath143 and showed that gravitational geon solutions exist for all parameter choices such that @xmath144 .",
    "these solutions include both weak field and strong field geons .",
