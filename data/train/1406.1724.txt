    "interest has recently been devoted to the capacity analysis of underlay cognitive radio systems in fading environments . in underlay",
    "cognitive radio , a secondary user ( su ) aggressively transmits its data over the primary user ( pu ) channel while keeping the interference experienced by the pu below a predefined _ interference temperature _ @xcite .",
    "the pu is usually assumed to be oblivious to the su activity , thus power control is applied by the su transmitter in order to meet with the predefined interference constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "gastpar has shown that imposing a receive power constraint in an awgn interference channel does not affect the channel capacity . however , in a fading environment , ghasemi and sousa proved that channel fluctuations can be exploited to improve the su capacity when the channel state information ( csi ) is available at the su transmitter @xcite .",
    "this capacity improvement is attributed to the ability of the su to transmit with very high power when the interference channel is severely faded . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "_ derived the ergodic , outage , and minimum - rate capacities under peak and average interference constraints at the pu receiver .",
    "however , the interference experienced by the su receiver due to primary transmission was not considered .",
    "recently , the ergodic capacity of underlay cognitive radio taking both pu and su interference into consideration was calculated in @xcite . however , the analysis therein is limited to the case when all channels are severely faded , and considers an average interference power constraint only .    in a practical underlay",
    "cognitive setting , the su capacity generally depends on two interference channels , namely ; the primary - to - secondary and secondary - to - primary channels @xcite .",
    "if these channels are subject to non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) fading , then the interference channel gains perceived by the pu and su receivers fluctuate drastically over time @xcite . therefore , the su transmitter can exploit such fluctuations by opportunistically allocating higher power to time instants when the signal - to - interference - and - noise - ratio ( sinr ) is large , and lower power to time instants with poor sinr @xcite-@xcite . in this paper , we study a practical underlay cognitive radio system with joint peak and average interference power constraints , where the mutual interference channels have dominant los ( specular ) components . we show that in this case , there are limited opportunities for the su due to the poor dynamic range of channel fluctuations .",
    "this results in a significant su capacity degradation .",
    "we term this problem as the _ exposed secondary user problem _",
    ", i.e. , the su is exposed to the pu via a direct los link .",
    "such problem would arise in emerging cognitive radio technologies such as underlay _",
    "device - to - device ( d2d ) communications _ , where the small antenna heights imply that a strong los component is likely to exist between the primary and secondary devices @xcite",
    ". it also appears in other recent cognitive radio approaches , such as the application of underlay cognitive radio to satellite systems @xcite , where the rician channel models inherent in conventional satellite communications will indeed be involved .",
    "a straightforward approach to improve the capacity of an arbitrary cognitive radio scheme is the deployment of multiple antennas .",
    "traditional multiple antenna diversity techniques were employed in @xcite-@xcite to improve the su capacity in spectrum sharing systems . however , the usage of multiple uncorrelated antennas is inhibited by the space limitations of mobile su transceivers .",
    "this is in addition to the need for multiple rf chains , which increases the cost and complexity of the su equipment .",
    "while such overhead is bearable for a base station , it can not be tolerated for modern mobile terminals . moreover , emerging cellular underlay _ d2d _",
    "technology involves a mobile su transmitter and a mobile su receiver @xcite , which prevents the deployment of multiple antennas at either terminals . in order to reduce the hardware complexity of multiple antenna systems , underlay cognitive radio with antenna selection",
    "is implemented using a single rf chain in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme requires antennas to be sufficiently seperated in order to achieve full spatial diversity order .",
    "moreover , an important limitation of all multiple - antenna schemes is the essence of obtaining the csi for every antenna in order to achieve diversity or multiplexing gains .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the usage of single electronically steerable parasitic array radiator ( espar ) antennas at both the su transmitter and receiver . in los channels ,",
    "these antennas are used to create artificial channel fluctuations to restore the transmission opportunities .",
    "this is achieved by a technique that we refer to as _ random aerial beamforming _ ( rab ) , where random time - varying complex weights are assigned to the orthonormal basis radiation patterns of the espar antenna . inspired by the seminal work of viswanath _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we term the orthonormal radiation patterns provided by the espar antenna as _ dumb basis patterns _ , since they represent degrees of freedom ( dofs ) that are neither used to achieve diversity nor to realize multiplexing .",
    "our analytical and numerical results show that the proposed scheme can make the los interference transparent to both the secondary and primary systems , thus achieving the same capacity of the symmetric rayleigh channel . furthermore ,",
    "if the secondary - to - secondary channel has a los component , we present a novel scheme that induces fluctuations in the interference channels while maintaining the reliability of the secondary - to - secondary channel .",
    "we refer to this technique as _ artificial diversity using smart basis patterns_. the proposed schemes have several advantages .",
    "first , no extra hardware complexity is involved as only a single rf chain is used .",
    "second , only overall csi is required to apply optimal power allocation .",
    "finally , the proposed schemes can be used in low cost mobile terminals with tight space limitations .",
    "in addition to the capacity benefits of rab in point - to - point underlay cognitive radio systems , we show that rab can play an important role in multiuser systems . by generalizing the exposed sus problem to an @xmath1 user _ parallel access channel _ , we prove that los interference reduces the scaling law of the su sum capacity from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . by using rab ,",
    "artificial fluctuations are induced in the interference channels restoring the @xmath2 scaling law .",
    "a fundamental result of this paper is that using rab , los interference can actually be exploited .",
    "we show that using only 2 basis patterns , multiuser interference diversity can be improved via opportunistic nulling . in this case , los interference act as a friend and not a foe .",
    "the application of espar and other classes of reconfigurable antennas to wireless communications systems is not actually new . in @xcite-@xcite , the _ aerial dof ( adof ) _ provided by the orthonormal basis patterns",
    "are used to construct single radio _ beamspace - multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) _ systems that can apply spatial multiplexing without the need to deploy multiple antennas .",
    "recently , beamspace - mimo was applied for millimeter - wave ( mm - wave ) systems using parasitic antenna arrays with reconfigurable loads @xcite .",
    "reconfigurable antennas with predefined sets of radiation patterns were also employed in @xcite to achieve diversity in spectrum sensing for interweave cognitive radio . in @xcite ,",
    "espar antennas were exploited for detecting spatial holes in multiple pu cognitive radio systems . moreover",
    ", blind interference alignment was implemented utilizing the reconfigurability feature of the espar antenna in @xcite .",
    "other applications of espar antennas in multiuser systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the system model is presented in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we present the exposed secondary users problem highlighting the capacity degradation due to los interference . the concept of rab is then proposed in section iv . in section",
    "v , we present the multiple exposed secondary users problem and investigate the impact of rab on multiuser interference diversity .",
    "numerical results are presented in section v and conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "we divide this section into three subsections .",
    "first , we briefly review the espar antenna structure and parameters .",
    "next , we present the beamspace domain channel model and show that orthonormal basis patterns can be viewed as virtual multiple antennas . finally , we present a generic system model for the spectrum - sharing system under study with and without espar antennas at su terminals .          as shown in fig .",
    "1 , an espar with @xmath0 elements is composed of a single active element ( e.g. , a @xmath4 dipole ) that is surrounded by @xmath5 identical parasitic elements . unlike multi - antenna systems ,",
    "the parasitic elements are placed relatively close to the active elements .",
    "hence , mutual coupling between different elements takes place and current is induced in all parasitic elements .",
    "the radiation pattern of the espar is altered by tuning a set of @xmath5 reactive loads ( varactors ) @xmath6 $ ] attached to the parasitic elements @xcite .",
    "the currents in the parasitic and active elements are represented by an @xmath7 vector @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 admittance matrix with @xmath11 being the mutual admittance between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 elements .",
    "the load matrix @xmath14 = * diag*@xmath15 controls the espar beamforming , @xmath16^{t}$ ] is an @xmath7 vector and @xmath17 is the complex feeding at the active element @xcite . the radiation pattern of the espar at an angle @xmath18 is thus given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20^{t}$ ] is the steering vector of the espar at an angle @xmath18 given by @xcite-@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the radius of the circular arrangement of parasitic antenna elements .",
    "the beamspace domain is a signal space where any radiation pattern can be represented as a point in this space . to represent the radiation pattern @xmath24 in the beamspace domain ,",
    "the steering vector @xmath25 is decomposed into a linear combination of a set of orthonormal basis patterns @xmath26 using gram - schmidt orthonormalization , where @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the orthonormal basis patterns of the espar ( also known as the adof @xcite-@xcite ) are equal to the number of parasitic elements ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) .",
    "therefore , the espar radiation pattern in terms of the orthonormal basis patterns can be written as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the weights assigned to the basis patterns and @xmath31 is an @xmath7 vector of projections of all the steering vectors on @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the espar radiation pattern is formed by manipulating the reactive loads attached to the parasitic elements .              in this section ,",
    "we construct a generic channel model for the espar antenna in the beamspace domain showing that the orthonormal basis patterns offer aerial degrees of freedom ( adof ) and can act as multiple virtual antennas . assume a conventional mimo system with @xmath33 transmit antennas and @xmath34 receive antennas .",
    "the channel between the transmitter and the receiver is characterized by the presence of @xmath35 scatterers as shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath36 scattering path is represented by a fading gain of @xmath37 , and a unique pair of transmit and receive angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this case , the received signal vector @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the channel matrix representing the coupling between antenna elements , @xmath43 is the transmitted signal vector , and @xmath44 is the noise vector . the channel matrix can be formulated as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the steering vectors of the transmitting and receiving arrays , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the receive and transmit steering matrices where @xmath50_{n_{r } \\times q}$ ] and @xmath51_{n_{t } \\times q}$ ] , and @xmath52 is a @xmath53 diagonal matrix .",
    "an equivalent model for the mimo channel is the _ virtual channel model _",
    "@xcite , which represents the coupling between virtual angular directions at the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "the channel matrix @xmath54 in this model is given by ( dropping the dependency on the angles for convenience ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the steering matrices corresponding to the virtual directions .",
    "iff @xmath58 and @xmath59 are unitary , then the virtual channel matrix can be written as , @xmath60 the matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the projections of @xmath63 and @xmath64 onto the square steering matrices corresponding to the virtual directions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath61 is a @xmath65 matrix containing vectors that represent the response of the orthonormal basis patterns to the scatterers .",
    "thus , @xmath66 and similarly , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 \\in \\mathbb{c}^{q \\times n_{r}}$ ] and @xmath69 \\in \\mathbb{c}^{q \\times n_{t}}$ ] contain the values of the @xmath34 and @xmath33 transmit and receive basis patterns towards the direction of the scatterers .",
    "the system input - output relationship can thus be written as @xmath70 assume that the data symbols are sent over diverse orthogonal beams rather than antenna elements , in this case the input to the antenna elements is not equal to the data symbols .",
    "the input to the antenna elements is related to the actual transmitted data symbols @xmath71 via a precoding matrix , i.e. , @xmath72 and the received signal perceived by the orthogonal beams at the receiver is given by @xmath73 .",
    "thus , an alternative implementation for mimo transmission is to send and receive symbols in the beamspace domain , and the channel matrix in this case can be represented as @xcite @xmath74 the matrix @xmath75 represents the coupling between the orthonormal basis patterns of the transmitter antenna array and the corresponding patterns at the receiver .",
    "the adof , which denote the amount of diverse dimensions in beamspace on which independent streams can be loaded , is given by @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "3 , a 3 @xmath77 3 mimo system is depicted .",
    "the conventional implementation of mimo transmission is to load every antenna element with an independent data symbol .",
    "alternatively , the implementation of mimo in the beamspace domain is to load each of the transmit orthonormal basis patterns ( @xmath78 ) with an independent symbol by appropriate precoding and applying the techniques in @xcite to demultiplex the symbols perceived by the receive basis patterns .",
    "now , recalling the structure of the espar antenna , we note that the concept of its operation is identical to beamspace mimo .",
    "although the espar antenna has only one active element , it can provide dof as it is capable of assigning independent weights to orthonormal patterns via adjusting reactive loads .",
    "thus , an espar antenna is analogous to mimo systems in the beamspace domain , and we can indeed consider the set of orthonormal patterns as multiple virtual antennas .",
    "assume an underlay cognitive radio system where single - user primary and secondary systems coexist as shown in fig .",
    "the received signals at the @xmath79 time instant are given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( pu - to - pu ) , @xmath82 ( pu - to - su ) , @xmath83 ( su - to - pu ) and @xmath84 ( su - to - su ) are the respective complex - valued overall channel gains ( linear combination of channel gains at all basis patterns ) . the primary and secondary signals @xmath85 and @xmath86 are complex - valued symbols drawn from an @xmath87-ary constellation , while @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the awgn samples with power spectral density @xmath90 at the secondary and primary receivers , respectively .",
    "the pu terminals are assumed to be equipped with single omnidirectional antennas while the antennas provided at the su terminals are assumed to have @xmath0 orthonormal basis patterns having a complex weight vector @xmath91 , where the @xmath92 weight @xmath93 has an arbitrary complex value @xmath94 .",
    "the weight value depends on the setting of the parasitic elements reactive loads .",
    "this model can be reduced to the conventional single antenna ( with no parasitic elements ) by setting the weight vector to @xmath95 $ ] , in which case one adof is available , corresponding to the active antenna element .",
    "we also assume perfect knowledge of these channels at the su transmitter and receiver .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our analysis fits any design for reconfigurable antennas with beamforming capabilities , and not only the espar antenna .",
    "we start with the conventional single antenna scheme with all parties employing single omnidirectional antennas . in this case",
    ", we set the weight vector for the model in section ii to @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the ergodic capacity maximization problem is a generalization for the problems in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopt a joint peak and average interference power constraints .",
    "in addition , we extend the work in @xcite and @xcite by considering the pu - to - su as well as the su - to - pu interference . the problem can be formulated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the average and peak interference power constraints , respectively , @xmath100 is the expectation operator , and @xmath101 is the su transmit power allocation as a function of the csi vector @xmath102 . without loss of generality , we set the noise spectral density @xmath90 = 1 w / hz .",
    "thus the snr of any link is equal to the transmit power of the pu / su transmitter multiplied by the channel power .",
    "the pu is assumed to transmit with a constant power of @xmath103 .",
    "the optimization problem in ( [ 3 ] ) can be easily solved using the lagrangian method @xcite .",
    "we define the lagrangian function @xmath104 as @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the solution for the optimal power allocation is obtained by maximizing the lagrangian function as @xmath108 yielding @xmath109 . in order to satisfy the peak constraint @xmath110 , and the constraint @xmath111",
    ", we have @xmath112 where the lagrange multiplier @xmath107 is obtained numerically to satisfy the constraints in ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "note that the peak interference constraint @xmath99 must be greater than the average interference constraint @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the peak constraint has an impact on su capacity only if @xmath113 .",
    "if the average constraint is very large ( i.e. , @xmath107 is very small ) , then defining a peak interference constraint is meaningless . by relaxing the peak interference constraint",
    ", we obtain the oprimal power allocation as @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "this power allocation policy can be graphically interpreted as water filling with a non - uniform ( time varying ) water level as shown in fig .",
    "5 . the water level depends on the su - to - pu fading channel and is quantified by the term @xmath116 .",
    "the allocated power at each time instant is the difference between the _ water level _ @xmath116 and the _ water depth _ @xmath117 .",
    "the optimal power allocation policy is sensitive to the @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 channels statistics as follows :    * the water level is controlled by the reciprocal of @xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath119 is not severely faded , then the problem reduces to the conventional constant water level power allocation policy .",
    "if @xmath119 is severely faded , the water level fluctuates over time allowing for larger amount of power to be allocated . *",
    "the water depth is controlled by both @xmath120 and the reciprocal of @xmath118 . if @xmath118 is severely faded",
    ", then the water depth is relatively small because @xmath121 is likely to have large values most of the time .",
    "contrarily , if @xmath120 is severely faded , the water depth is relatively large because @xmath120 is likely to have small values .",
    "based on ( [ 4 ] ) , the ergodic capacity is given in ( [ 5 ] ) , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath124 .",
    "the random variable @xmath124 jointly describes the water level and depth , i.e. , it is proportional to the ratio between both quantities .",
    "when @xmath118 is severely faded and @xmath119 has a los component , the random variable @xmath124 will have an exponentially decaying tail , and it will be highly likely that @xmath124 has a small value . on the other hand , when @xmath119 is severely faded and @xmath118 has a los component , the random variable @xmath124 will have a heavier tail and it will be highly likely that @xmath124 will have large values , which corresponds to large allocated power .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we investigate the su capacity when the sus are exposed to the pu via a direct los channel .",
    "we highlight the negative impact of los interference on the su capacity and show that los interference hinders the capacity gain obtained by opportunistic power allocation . in the following analysis , an @xmath125 scenario describes the one where the su - to - su channel is subject to a fading distribution @xmath126 and the mutual interference channels ( su - to - pu and pu - to - su channels ) are subject to fading distribution @xmath127 . in each scenario , we aim at identifying the behavior of the interference channels and the power allocation opportunities offered to the su transmitter .",
    "@xmath128      in this scenario , all the channels have los components . in other words , both the su - to - su and the mutual interference channels are not severely faded .",
    "we adopt a rician model for the su - to - su , su - to - pu , and pu - to - su channels as follows : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 . the parameters @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 are the @xmath137-factors ( specular components ) of the @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 channels , respectively .",
    "the components @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are the diffused components where @xmath144 , while @xmath145 are the constant phases of the los components .",
    "non - identical rician channels with average channel powers of @xmath146 are assumed for the channels @xmath147 .",
    "the pdf of the channel power @xmath148 when @xmath149 follows a rician distribution is given by @xcite @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the modified bessel function of the first kind . in the rician - rician scenario , both @xmath119 and @xmath120 follow the distribution in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the dynamic range of the interference channels ( @xmath152,@xmath153 ) fluctuations can be expressed by the variance ( @xmath154 ) of the rician distribution @xcite @xmath155 @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the square of the laguerre polynomial .",
    "an interesting scenario is when the @xmath137-factor tends to @xmath158 .",
    "given that the limit of the laguerre polynomial is @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the gamma function @xcite , it can be easily shown that the variance of the interference channels @xmath154 tends to 0 when @xmath161 .",
    "thus , a dominant los interference signal makes the interference channel almost deterministic .",
    "therefore , for the rician - rician scenario with @xmath162 , the pdfs of @xmath124 and @xmath120 tend to @xmath163 the ergodic su capacity is obtained by plugging @xmath123 and @xmath164 in ( [ 5 ] ) , leading to the same capacity of the awgn interference channel under receive power constraint as follows @xmath165 which is the su capacity when all channels are awgn with no fading . based on this analysis",
    ", we conclude the following remark . + * remark 1 : * because no su transmit power constraint is imposed , the amount of average power transmitted by the su is controlled by the statistics of @xmath119 and @xmath120 . if both channels are not severely faded , the su transmits with an almost constant power level , which can be interpreted as an equivalent transmit power constraint whose value is decided by @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this means that non - severely faded interference channels hinder the opportunistic behavior of the su .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a los component in the su - to - su channel makes the su capacity reduce to the deterministic awgn capacity .      in this scenario ,",
    "the su - to - su channel is characterized by a large dynamic range ( large variance ) and follows a rayleigh distribution , while the interference channels have a los component and follow a rician distribution .",
    "the random variable @xmath122 is the ratio between the squares of a rayleigh and a rician random variable . in order to obtain the capacity ,",
    "we first rewrite the pdf of @xmath119 in ( [ 7 ] ) in terms of the meijer-@xmath168 function @xmath169 [ 26 , sec .",
    "7.8 ] as @xmath170 @xmath171 noting that @xmath118 follows an exponential distribution with @xmath172 and that the pdf of @xmath173 is given by @xmath174 @xcite , one can obtain the expression in ( [ 9 ] ) for the pdf of @xmath124 . using the property @xmath175 , the integral",
    "can be evaluated as the standard laplace transform of a meijer-@xmath168 function @xcite yielding the result in ( 16 ) .",
    "we notice that when the @xmath137-factors @xmath176 , the pdfs of interest tend to @xmath177 thus , the ergodic capacity of the su is obtained by plugging the pdfs @xmath123 and @xmath164 in ( [ 5 ] ) . unlike the rician - rician scenario ,",
    "the variable @xmath124 is not deterministic at large values of @xmath135 .",
    "instead , @xmath124 is exponentially distributed , which implies that @xmath123 has an exponentially - bounded tail .",
    "because a pdf with an exponentially - decaying tail gives small weight to large values of @xmath124 , the capacity of the su is still limited as it depends on the integral @xmath178 .",
    "we quantify the su capacity of this scenario in the following lemma .",
    "_ for asymptotically large @xmath137-factors and infinite peak interference constraint , the su capacity in the rician - rayleigh scenario is bounded by @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the exponential integral function . at large snr for the su - to - su channel ( @xmath181 )",
    ", the su capacity tends to @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the asymptotic inequality and @xmath184 is the euler - mascheroni constant . at low su - to - su snr ( @xmath185 )",
    ", the su capacity tends to @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the lagrange multiplier for the awgn channel .",
    "_    see appendix a.    note that the su capacity in terms of the lagrangian multiplier when all the channels are awgn is given by @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the results of lemma 1 suggest the following :    * for an asymptotically large @xmath189 , the su capacity in the rician - rayleigh scenario is less than the awgn capacity by a constant gap that is equal to the _ euler - mascheroni _ constant @xmath190 bits / sec / hz . * for asymptotically small @xmath189 ,",
    "the su capacity in the rician - rayleigh scenario is greater than the awgn capacity as it can be shown that @xmath191 .",
    "these conclusions lead to the following remark .",
    "+ * remark 2 : * severe fading in the su - to - su link is generally a source of _ unreliability_. in other words , su - to - su channel fluctuations results in an unreliable channel . the only way to exploit such fluctuations is to optimally allocate power based on the su transmitter csi at low snr , where the capacity is inherently power limited .",
    "this corresponds to the conventional point - to - point fading channel with csi at the transmitter analyzed by goldsmith and varaiya in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the los components in the interference channels hinder any opportunities to improve the capacity , and the optimal power allocation is almost oblivious to the interference channel fluctuations .",
    "@xmath192      in this scenario , all channels are severely faded with drastic fluctuations over time . because @xmath139 does not have a los component ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath124 can be obtained by setting @xmath135 to 0 in ( 16 ) yielding @xmath193 which is the _ log - logistic _ distribution .",
    "it can be shown that the log - logistic distribution is a _ fat - tailed distribution _ by showing that @xmath194 \\sim z^{-\\alpha}$ ] as @xmath195 , where @xmath196 and @xmath197 is the asymptotic equivalence .",
    "thus , the pdf of the variable @xmath124 has a heavier right - tail in the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario compared to the rician - rician and rician - rayleigh scenarios , which means that @xmath198 in ( [ 5 ] ) will be larger in the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario as @xmath123 is slowly decaying and will give significantly larger weights to larger values of @xmath199 ( note that @xmath199 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath124 ) . on the other hand , @xmath120 still has an exponentially bounded tail . again",
    ", this contributes to the su capacity enhancement as @xmath200 depends on @xmath201 in ( [ 5 ] ) , where @xmath202 is a constant .",
    "thus , severely faded interference channels offer su capacity gain even if the su - to - su channel is severely faded as well .",
    "the su opportunistic behavior can be quantified by the pdf tails for @xmath124 and @xmath120 .",
    "the heavier the tail of @xmath123 and the faster the pdf of @xmath120 decays , the larger is the su capacity .",
    "recalling the water filling power allocation , the heavy tail of @xmath124 means that the ratio between the water level and depth is likely to have a large value ( i.e. , large allocated power ) .      in this scenario ,",
    "the su - to - su channel is a reliable los channel , while the interference channels are severely faded . assuming that the su - to - su @xmath137-factor is asymptotically large , we can approximate the pdf of @xmath118 as @xmath203 . each of the interference channels @xmath119 and @xmath120 follows an exponential distribution .",
    "thus , the variable @xmath122 is the reciprocal of an exponential random variable .",

    "thus , the water level to depth ratio is likely to have large values over time allowing for opportunistic power allocation at the su transmitter .    combining remarks 1 , 2 , and 3",
    ", we reach the following conclusion .",
    "the capacity of an underlay cognitive system with interference constraints at the pu receiver depends on the statistics of the pu - to - su and su - to - pu interference channels . when the interference channels are severely faded , the water filling power allocation can offer a significant capacity gain compared to the awgn scenario . however , when the sus are _ exposed _ to the pus via los channels , the su transmitter finds limited power allocation opportunities and the capacity of such system becomes similar to the awgn capacity for asymptotically large @xmath137-factors .",
    "the impact of the su - to - su channel statistics is similar to conventional point - to - point fading channels , where fading is generally considered a source of unreliability .",
    "however , at low su - to - su channel snr , such fluctuations can be exploited to improve capacity when optimal power allocation is applied .",
    "motivated by the analysis in the previous section , we propose a technique that can eliminate the impact of los interference by improving the dynamic range of interference channels fluctuations .",
    "this is achieved by rab , which intentionally induces artificial fluctuations in these channels by randomizing the complex weights assigned to the basis patterns of an espar antenna . throughout this section",
    ", we adopt the system model presented in section ii , with an espar antenna weight vector of @xmath206 $ ] .      by viewing the adof provided by the orthonormal basis patterns as _ virtual dumb antennas _ or _ dumb basis patterns _ , we adjust the reactive loads of the parasitic antenna elements such that the weights assigned to the basis patterns are randomly varied over time .",

    "the entries of @xmath215 denote the deterministic phase shifts of the los components at various basis patterns .",

    "the receiver uses an espar antenna with @xmath230 basis patterns . a weight vector of @xmath231 $ ] , where the set of phase shifts @xmath232 are independent and uniformly distributed .",
    "because an espar antenna has a single rf chain , the received beamspace signal vector @xmath209 can not be handeled in the rf front - end .",

    "however , if the secondary channel is rician ( reliable los channel ) , rab will turn it into a severely - faded one . therefore ,",
    "the techniques explained in the previous subsection are applicable for the rician - rayleigh scenario , but not for the rician - rician scenario . if the secondary channel is a reliable los channel , we aim at maintaining its reliability while inducing fluctuations in the interference channels .",
    "this can be achieved by a technique that we refer to as _ artificial receive diversity_. based on ( [ th1 ] ) , the su - to - su equivalent channel can be given by @xmath270 .",

    "thus , the more basis patterns at the receive espar antenna , the less fluctuations observed in @xmath279 . in this case , the receive basis patterns act as smart basis patterns , and because this diversity scheme averages the fluctuations that were artificially induced by the su transmitter , we term it as artificial diversity . for an asymptotically large @xmath230",
    ", the los component can be perfectly reconstructed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , although the receive basis patterns act as smart antennas for the su - to - su link , they still act as dumb antennas for the pu - to - su link , as the espar weights at the su receiver are not selected based on the pu - to - su csi and fluctuations are still induced in the interference channels .",
    "an interesting analogy between the artificial diversity and spread - spectrum systems can be constructed . in spread - spectrum systems , the transmitter _ spreads the spectrum _ of the transmitted signal using a _ random code sequence _ to minimize the ability of a hostile transceiver to _ intercept / jam _ such signal , and the receiver _ de - spreads _ the spectrum of the signal before decoding . in the proposed artificial diversity scheme , the su transmitter _ spreads the pdf _ of the transmitted signal over a larger dynamic range using _ random weights _ for orthogonal basis patterns to minimize the _ pu - to - su _ and the _ su - to - pu _ interference , and the su receiver _ de - spreads _ the pdf of the signal before decoding .",
    "in this section , we shift from _ temporal _ opportunistic power allocation in point - to - point channels , to _ spatial _ opportunistic scheduling in multiuser channels . in a conventional multiuser network , selecting the user with the best instantaneous channel condition results in a multiuser diversity ( md ) gain in the achievable sum capacity .",

    ", it was shown that los channels hinder the achievable md gain .",
    "it is expected that a similar effect would be encountered when considering los interference in an underlay cognitive setting . in this section",
    ", we aim at answering the following question :  _ how would los interference affect the su capacity scaling ? _ \" this section can be considered as a generalization for the _ exposed su problem _ when multiple sus exist .",
    "while there exists multiple settings for the multiple su scenario , we limit our discussion to the _ parallel access channel _ ( pac ) for the following reasons .",
    "first , unlike the multi - access and broadcast channels , the pac involves the impact of both multiuser transmit and receive interference diversity @xcite .",
    "second , this setting is applicable for multiuser underlay d2d communications in cellular systems @xcite .",

    "thus , the su capacity scales like @xmath314 , which means that the multiuser gain scales faster with the number of users in the underlay cognitive system compared to conventional interference free system .",

    "is given in ( [ th1 ] ) .",

    "while classical opportunistic beamforming introduced in @xcite intended to schedule users at the peaks of their channel gains , the application of rab in the underlay cognitive system intends to schedule users at the nulls of the interference channels .",

    "see appendix d.    theorem 3 suggests that increasing @xmath220 and @xmath230 leads to an increase in the effective magnitude of the fixed component by a factor of @xmath321 , but has no effect on the @xmath2 term in the growth rate .",
    "this can be interpreted by the impact of the number of basis patterns on the dynamic range of the su - to - su channel fluctautions .",
    "increasing @xmath220 and @xmath230 leads to increasing the dynamic range of @xmath317 by increasing the maximum possible value of the su - to - su artificial fading component ( see appendix d ) .",
    "this directly leads to an improvement in the md gain .",
    "however , the impact of md on the overall capacity scaling is not as cruical as the impact of mid . as stated in remark 4 , los interference causes the capacity to scale with @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 . from theorem 3 , it is obvious that after applying rab , the capacity scales with @xmath2 regardless of the @xmath137-factor of the interference channels .    while it is obvious from theorem 3 that increasing @xmath220 and @xmath230 improves the md gain by increasing the su - to - su channel dynamic range , the impact of @xmath220 and @xmath230 on the mid gain is not straightforward .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath322 corresponds to the case of rayleigh fading .",
    "thus , in a los interference environment , when only two dumb basis patterns ( 1 parasitic element ) is employed at the su transmitter , the mid gain is better than that in a rayleigh fading interference channel .",
    "this is because mid does not depend on the dynamic range of the interference channel fluctuations , but depends on how frequent this interference channel is set to an arbitrarily small gain @xmath323 . in fig .",
    "7 , we plot the pdf of the artificial fading component after applying rab with various numbers of basis patterns .",
    "it is clear that with 2 basis patterns , the artificial fading component is highly likely to either have the maximum value of @xmath350 , or have a small value near zero .",
    "as the number of basis patterns increase , the dynamic range increases and the pdf converges to an exponential distribution .",
    "it is clear that for an an arbitrarily small gain @xmath323 , the probability that the artificial fading channel becomes less than @xmath323 is highest for the case of 2 basis patterns .",
    "thus , two basis patterns null the interference more frequently than the conventional rayleigh fading scenario .",
    "this leads to the following remark . + * remark 5 : * los interference hinders the achievable mid gain and changes the capacity scaling law from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . using dumb basis patterns , not only can one restore the capacity scaling law of @xmath2 , but los interference can be exploited as well . using 2 basis patterns , the mid can be improved compared to the rayleigh fading scenario due to the desirable characteristics of the artificial fading channel pdf .",
    "the conclusions in remark 5 have a great impact on the hardware implementation of rab using espar antennas .",
    "because we only need one parasitic antenna , the value of the reactive load needed to adjust the random weights of the basis patterns can be obtained in closed form ( refer to the espar antenna model in section ii ) . moreover",
    ", an espar with one parasitic antenna entails less complexity and more compactness .",
    "this section provides numerical results for the techniques presented throughout the paper .",

    "we define the factor @xmath354 and plot the ergodic capacity for @xmath355 ( no peak interference constraint ) and @xmath356 . as expected , the su capacity is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath98 .",
    "in other words , the su is allowed to transmit with higher power when the interference constraint is relaxed .",
    "we can also observe that when a joint peak and average interference constraint is imposed , the capacity decreases , and the amount of degradation is more significant for smaller values of @xmath98 .",
    "it is notable that for all fading scenarios , the su capacity is larger than the awgn capacity , which agrees with the results in @xcite .",
    "the awgn capacity is a special case of the rician - rician scenario when @xmath357 .",
    "thus , the awgn channel is an extreme case of the los interference scenario tackled in section iii .",
    "note that at @xmath358 db , the rayleigh - rician scenario offers the best su capacity because it enjoys a reliable su - to - su link , and severely - faded interference channels , which matches with the conclusions in remark 2 .",
    "los interference can significantly degrade the su capacity , as a capacity gap of 1.05 bps / hz is observed between the rayleigh - rician and rician - rician scenarios .",
    "also , the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario offers a capacity increase of about 0.75 bps / hz more than the rician - rician scenario , which means that the degradation caused by severely faded su - to - su link is less harmful than los interference .",
    "the rician - rayleigh scenario performs worse than the rician - rician scenario as it suffers from both severely faded su - to - su channel and los interference .",
    "it can be also observed that all fading scenarios that include a rayleigh faded su - to - su channel are more sensitive to the peak interference constraint , because the large dynamic range of the su - to - su channel implies that the allocated su transmit power will ",

    "as @xmath98 increases , the su capacity gain due to opportunistic power allocation decreases and approaches unity . for @xmath360 db , the su capacity is still larger than the awgn capacity , but the achievable capacity gain is less than the case when @xmath359 db . for @xmath361",
    "db , the su capacity is less than half of the awgn capacity , and the impact of @xmath98 is negligible .",
    "this is because at high su - to - su average snr , fading is a source of unreliability .    to eliminate the negative impact of los interference",
    ", the concept of opportunistic spectrum sharing using dumb basis patterns was proposed .",
    "10 shows the pdf of the interference channel magnitude ( @xmath152 or @xmath153 ) before and after applying rab for various numbers of basis patterns .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "10 that as the number of basis patterns increases , the pdf of the equivalent channel spreads , indicating a larger dynamic range of fluctuations .",
    "it is shown that 5 basis patterns ( 5 parasitic elements ) are enough to convert a rician channel to a rayleigh one .",
    "any further increase in the number of basis patterns will not result in an increase in the dynamic range of the channel .",
    "11 depicts the magnitude of an interference channel ( @xmath152 or @xmath153 ) versus time before and after applying rab .",
    "it is clear that after applying rab , the resultant channel will have a larger dynamic range and more occurrences of deep fades ( marked with circles ) than the los channel .",
    "12 shows the pdf of an interference channel after applying rab , and then after de - spreading at the su receiver by the aid of artificial diversity .    in fig .",
    "13 , we investigate the impact of the number of basis patterns on the achieved capacity gain . for the rician - rayleigh scenario ,",
    "only one parasitic element is enough to achieve a significant capacity gain relative to the rician - rician scenario .",
    "any further increase in the number of parasitic elements will make the capacity of the rician - rayleigh scenario converge to that of the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the rician - rician scenario , where we apply the artificial diversity scheme to regain the reliability of the su - to - su channel .",
    "we investigate the su capacity scaling behavior in fig .",
    "14 by plotting the su sum capacity normalized by a single su capacity versus the number of su pairs in a pac .",
    "we note that the sum capacity in the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario grows faster than a reference network experiencing a @xmath3 growth rate .",
    "this is due to mid , which allows the capacity to scale like @xmath2 . as illustrated in remark 4 , when los interference is encountered in the rician - rayleigh scenario",
    ", we note that the capacity scales with the same rate of the reference network .",
    "thus , los interference hinders mid and the growth rate becomes @xmath3 . while the rayleigh - rician scenario causes a minor loss in the md gain with no effect on the growth rate , the rician - rician scenario experiences no md and mid gains , and the sum capacity is nearly constant for any number of su pairs .    in fig .",
    "15 , we show that using rab with only 2 basis patterns , one can regain the md gain losses encountered in the rayleigh - rician scenario .",
    "more importantly , fig . 15",
    "shows that los interference can be exploited .",
    "when applying rab in the rician - rayleigh scenario , the su sum capacity becomes superior to that of the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario due to the impact of opportunistic nulling , as explained in remark 5 .",
    "16 demonstrates the capacity growth rates for various scenarios by plotting the sum capacity normalized by the growth function .",
    "we see that in the rician - rayleigh scenario , the capacity grows like @xmath3 as the ratio between the capacity and @xmath3 tends to a constant as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this constant is known as the _ pre - log _ factor .",
    "we can also see that , while the rayleigh - rayleigh scenario grows like @xmath2 , it has a less pre - log factor compared to the rician - rayleigh scenario with the application of rab .",
    "thus , applying rab with 2 basis patterns in an environment with los interference improves the pre - log factor and maintains the @xmath2 growth rate , which interprets the results in fig .",
    "in this paper , we presented a comprehensive analysis for the negative impact of los mutual interference on the su capacity in a spectrum sharing system .",
    "it was shown that when the dynamic range of the interference channel is small , the su capacity is significantly decreased . stemming from this point",
    ", we introduced the rab technique to induce channel fluctuations in the interference channel using the _ dumb basis patterns _ of an espar antenna .",
    "if the secondary channel contains a los component , we adopt an _ artificial diversity scheme _ to maintain its reliability while inducing fluctuations in the interference channels .",
    "moreover , we investigated the impact of los interference on the multiuser interference diversity achieved in an underlay parallel access channel . while los interference alters the capacity scaling to be @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 , we show that using rab , los interference can be actually exploited to improve the scaling pre - log factor in addition to the restoration of the @xmath2 growth rate .",
    "the proposed rab scheme requires a single rf chain , and can fit within tight space limitations .",
    "thus , it is adequate for low cost mobile transceivers .",
    "our future work includes evaluating capacity scaling for the cognitive mac channel @xcite@xcite , and deploying reconfigurable antennas to apply blind interference alignment @xcite .",
    "by relaxing the peak interference constraint and setting @xmath362 in ( [ 5 ] ) , and assuming that @xmath120 is deterministic and equal to @xmath167 , the su capacity is given by @xmath363 substituting @xmath364 , this integral can be reduced to @xmath365 , which can be easily evaluated as @xmath366 for @xmath181 , we have @xmath367 .",
