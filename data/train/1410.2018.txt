    "theoretical understanding of hadron production in high energy hadronic interactions is one of the most relevant subjects in qcd . for example , in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , the subsequent space - time evolution of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is described by relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "thus it is very important to fix a reliable initial condition for hydrodynamical simulations in order to extract the correct dynamics of the reaction .",
    "another example is the air - shower development induced by ultrahigh - energy cosmic - rays ( uhecr ) , which is very sensitive to high - energy hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "the interactions are usually simulated using a monte - carlo event generator , and the choice of an interaction model may critically affect the air shower analysis .    as an incident energy increases in a hadronic collision , reactions involving small bjorkens-@xmath0 gluons become dominant , and a framework which treats a highly dense gluonic system is needed .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework has been proposed in order to describe such a dense gluon system  @xcite in which the saturation scale @xmath1 characterizes nonlinear nature of the system .    for practical computation of gluon production in the cgc framework , two different approaches are often taken : solving classical yang - mills equation on the lattice  @xcite or the @xmath2-factorized production formula with unintegrated gluon distribution ( ugd ) with saturation  @xcite .",
    "they have been successful in explaining many experimental data at rhic and lhc energies .",

    ", it can be well reproduced by the @xmath2-factorization formula combined with the fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "a hybrid formalism was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the collisions between a dilute projectile and a dense target ( dumitru - hayashigaki - jalilian - marian ( dhj ) formula ) .",
    "it has been applied to the computations of forward particle production spectra , not only for charged hadrons and pions , but also for baryons  @xcite in d+au collisions .",
    "the dhj formula was also utilized to compute baryon productions for au+au collisions in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is found that transverse momentum spectra and net - baryon rapidity distributions in au+au collisions at rhic are well described with the dhj formula .",
    "substantial progresses were made recently : the balitsky - kovchegov equation with running - coupling accuracy ( rcbk equation )  @xcite was obtained , and numerical methods have been developed to solve the rcbk evolution  @xcite .",
    "a global analysis was performed with the rcbk equation for the nucleon structure function measured at hera at small values of @xmath4 , which yields good fits ( the aamqs parametrization )  @xcite . at the same time , when applied to hadronic interactions , the aamqs parametrization provides a good agreement with the data at rhic and lhc @xcite .",

    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the hybrid formula were computed in refs .",
    "it is found that the nlo corrections yield the same @xmath3 dependence as the leading - order ( lo ) expression in the regime @xmath5 , where non - linear effects are strong , and thus the lo formula can be applied with a constant @xmath6-factor at forward rapidities .",

    "momenta of quarks and gluons are generated according to the @xmath7-factorization formula , and the hadronization is performed using the lund string fragmentation model .",
    "this approach allows one to describe particle production from low to high momentum region consistently .",

    "<S> we develop a monte - carlo event generator based on combination of a parton production formula including the effects of parton saturation ( called the dhj formula ) and hadronization process due to the lund string fragmentation model . </S>",

    "<S> we analyze transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons as well as identified particles ; pion , kaon , ( anti-)proton at rhic energy , and ultra - forward neutral pion spectra from lhcf experiment . </S>",
