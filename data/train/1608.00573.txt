    "with the recent discovery of thousands of exoplanets , we now know that stars harboring of planets is not unique to our solar system .",
    "not only are exoplanets ubiquitous throughout our galaxy , but equally commonplace is the diversity of these systems .",
    "indeed , discoveries such as hot jupiters and super - earths have made our own solar system quite definitively not representative .",
    "a prime example of systems that differ from the solar system are those in which a large number of planets are packed into orbits smaller than @xmath00.3 au , comprising about 50% of all sun - like systems @xcite .",
    "what causes these systems to be so dynamically packed ?",
    "one possibility is migration : planets are formed at larger orbital distances and then driven inward through angular momentum exchange with disk gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is in situ formation : planets form from gas and solids already present at small distances from the central star . for this mechanism to work , very high concentrations of solids",
    "must be present at small radii @xcite .",
    "a question perhaps even more intriguing than the origin of these close - in exoplanets is how only @xmath2% of all sun - like systems have ended up in this configuration .",
    "if these planets do form in situ , then there should be a bimodal distribution of protoplanetary disk properties , in which @xmath2% of disks have conditions favorable for the formation of planets at small radii , and the remaining 50% lack these conditions .    in this letter , we show that the bimodal distribution of observed exoplanet orbital distances can be traced back to the orientation of large scale magnetic fields relative to the rotation axis of the protoplanetary disk from which these planets spawned .",
    "the orientation of this magnetic field fundamentally affects the accretion stresses in the disk and thus the gas surface density , which in turn affects how small solids drift through the disk and their concentration relative to the gas . as we show in the following sections , our calculations suggest that planetesimal formation is strongly favored for @xmath3au in systems with magnetic fields oriented parallel to the disk s rotation axis . assuming a uniform distribution of magnetic field orientations and in situ formation , this equates to 50% of systems producing exoplanets at small radii .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows .",
    "we describe our steady - state semi - analytic model in section  [ model ] , and then present our main results in section  [ results ] .",
    "we wrap up with a brief discussion in section  [ summary ] .",
    "our model consists of a 1d steady state disk comprised of both gas and solids .",
    "the steady - state gas surface density is set by the turbulent viscosity ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the steady - state mass accretion rate onto the central star , which we assume to be @xmath6yr , and the turbulent viscosity is defined via the standard @xcite @xmath1 parameter , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the locally isothermal sound speed of the gas ( defined via the temperature below ) , and @xmath9 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "we take the temperature to be that of the minimum mass solar nebula model ( mmsn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,    @xmath10    we treat the solid particles , with radius @xmath11 and mass density @xmath12 , as a fluid with surface density @xmath13 . without any particle sinks or sources ,",
    "the evolution of this surface density is governed by the continuity equation ,    @xmath14 \\right ) = 0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the radial flux of solids due to turbulent diffusion , and @xmath16 is the radial flux of solids due to aerodynamic coupling between the solids and gas .",
    "the metallicity is @xmath17 , and in the limit @xmath18 , the diffusive flux is written as @xcite ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the particle diffusivity .",
    "we can write a form for the particle diffusivity in terms of the dimensionless stopping time of the solids , @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the _ dimensional _ stopping time ) and the gas diffusivity @xmath23 ( the diffusivity that would apply to a trace gas species within the disk ) as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the gas diffusivity scales with the turbulent viscosity @xmath25 , with a constant of proportionality @xmath26 that is sensitive to the structure of whatever turbulent process is giving rise to angular momentum transport ( discussed more in section  [ alpha ] ) ; @xmath27 .",
    "the advective radial flux @xmath16 arises because of aerodynamic coupling between solid particles and the gas . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the strongly coupled solids move at the same speed as the local gas , given by the accretion rate @xmath5 as @xmath29 . for general @xmath30",
    ", there is also a component of the radial drift relative to the gas due to a mismatch between the azimuthal velocities of the particles and gas @xcite . combining these effects",
    ", we express the advective radial flux as @xcite ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the keplerian velocity and    @xmath33,\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is defined via the local radial slope of the vertical gas scale height , @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    for the assumed temperature profile , @xmath37 .    we define the stopping time of the solids in two separate ways , depending on the location in the disk . inside of the snow line at 2.7 au , we follow @xcite and set the maximum @xmath30 by the fragmentation velocity , @xmath38 ,    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the value of @xmath1 at the disk mid - plane , where ( through settling ) most of the solids are concentrated . for silicates",
    "@xmath41  m / s @xcite , but this velocity depends non - trivially on particle size @xcite . here , we assume @xmath42  m / s for the fiducial case and vary it in what follows .    outside of the snow line , we assume that particles reach mm sizes .",
    "our reason for this assumption is two fold .",
    "first , coagulation simulations have indicated that beyond the snow line , solids can grow to larger sizes as the ice present in these solids allows for enhanced sticking and is less susceptible to fragmentation @xcite .",
    "second , sub millimeter observations show that mm size grains are prevalent at large radii in many protoplanetary disk systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the snow line serves as a natural transition from smaller particles ( their exact size depending on @xmath40 ) to larger particles that are seen in observations , albeit at large radii .",
    "thus , @xmath30 outside of the snow line is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 mm .",
    "prior to disk dispersal , the gas surface density in the inner disk evolves on a time scale of @xmath0 myr , while the local radial drift time , @xmath46 , of mm to cm - size particles is orders of magnitude shorter .",
    "we can thus assume a fixed gas profile , and compute the steady - state distribution of particles drifting radially through the gas from a large reservoir situated further out .",
    "equation  ( [ dust_continuity ] ) then becomes ,    @xmath47    the constant @xmath48 is the radial mass flux of solids , @xmath49 , which we parameterize via the ratio of solid to gas accretion rates , @xmath50 .",
    "this ratio is a free parameter in our model , but we can estimate values based on taking equation  ( [ concentration_differential ] ) in the limit of large radial distances , assuming diffusion is weak to advection at these distances ( which is borne out by our calculations ) , and assuming @xmath28 . at large @xmath51 , radial drift dominates over accretion with the gas ( again supported by our calculations ) .",
    "one can then rewrite equation  ( [ concentration_differential ] ) to calculate @xmath50 as a function of @xmath52 , @xmath30 , @xmath1 , @xmath53 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the scenario we envision is a reservoir of gas at large radii with ism values for the metallicity ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we take @xmath55 and @xmath56@xmath57 as reasonable estimates may be higher at larger radial distances because the gas surface density drops below the ionization depth of fuv photons ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] at large distances , and constant @xmath1 results in @xmath53  =  -1 for our disk . for these values",
    "we find @xmath58@xmath59 ; our fiducial value is @xmath60 and we explore @xmath61 and @xmath62 in what follows .",
    "we numerically integrate equation  ( [ concentration_differential ] ) to determine the metallicity as a function of radius , assuming that the concentration of solids goes to zero at the inner edge of our disk , which we take to be the dust destruction radius , @xmath63 ( for the temperature structure assumed here ) ; @xmath64 .",
    "finally , at the snow line , we reduce @xmath52 by a factor of 2 , following the arguments in @xcite .",
    "a key component to our model is the dependence of @xmath1 on the relative orientation of the large scale , vertical ( i.e. , perpendicular to the disk plane ) magnetic field to the disk s rotation axis .",
    "numerical simulations that include all three non - ideal magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) effects present in protoplanetary disks have shown that for @xmath6560 au , the hall effect leads to two different states of the disk within these regions , depending on the value of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "for aligned field and angular momentum vector ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) and for the field strengths explored here ( see below ) , @xmath68 within the inner disk , whereas in the anti aligned case ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) , @xmath70@xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we use the quantified @xmath1 values from these numerical simulations in order to construct @xmath72 for our model .",
    "in particular , we fit a power - law to the @xmath1 values in the work of @xcite assuming a uniform in radius ratio of mid - plane gas to vertical magnetic pressure , @xmath73 .",
    "we choose this particular value because @xmath73 provides the largest sample of @xmath1 values from recent simulations , and for reasonable gas surface density profiles ( such as in the mmsn ) , the resulting @xmath1 values correspond to @xmath74yr ( though , here , we do the opposite and assume @xmath74yr and then calculate @xmath75 ) .",
    "our power law fits to the @xmath1 values are given by    @xmath76    where @xmath77  au .",
    "the physical reason for assuming a single value for @xmath1 ( i.e. , independent of magnetic field orientation ) at @xmath78 is the relatively weaker hall effect at these large radii , thus removing the bimodal @xmath1 behavior @xcite .",
    "we cap @xmath1 at 0.05 ; larger values do not change our results significantly but require more radial zones for integrating the solution .",
    "finally , we set @xmath79 everywhere ( taken from recent simulations : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore @xmath1 is not allowed to go below @xmath40 .",
    "solids will be concentrated towards the mid - plane and thus feel a diffusivity set by @xmath40 .",
    "however , since these solids are swept inwards by accretion , this  viscosity \" component is set by @xmath1 as this parameterizes the accretion flow .",
    "this amounts to a definition of the ratio between diffusivity and accretion viscosity of @xmath80 .",
    "we consider planetesimal formation to be possible if one of two criteria are satisfied , first , following the arguments in @xcite , if the metallicity increases beyond a critical value , it is possible for gravitational collapse of particles to proceed , independent of @xmath30 and without any interference from the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "we use equation ( 15 ) in @xcite to calculate a critical surface density for solids for each magnetic field orientation .",
    "this can be easily converted to a critical metallicity , @xmath81 and we assume that if @xmath82 prompt planetesimal formation occurs .    if @xmath83 , planetesimal formation is still possible when the values of @xmath52 and @xmath30 fall within the allowed region of parameter space for the streaming instability @xcite to operate .",
    "this allowed space is still uncertain , but recently @xcite carried out a large suite of streaming instability calculations and mapped out the allowed streaming region in @xmath52@xmath30 space . in what follows",
    ", we include both planetesimal formation regions on plots of @xmath52-@xmath30 space and assume that if the solution enters these regions , in situ planetesimal and planet formation occurs .",
    "here , we run our model as described above and vary both the relative radial drift rate of solids , @xmath50 , and the fragmentation velocity , @xmath38 , as these are both rather uncertain parameters . we save a more in - depth parameter survey for future work .",

    "the @xmath69 case is unstable to direct collapse at small radii , but enters the streaming unstable regime beyond @xmath89 au .",
    "we do nt expect @xmath50 to be significantly less than 0.1 as a value of @xmath90 would equate to co - accretion of solids with the gas flow at large distances from the star ; a simple calculation reveals that radial drift strongly dominates accretion at these radii .    finally , we tested the robustness of the fiducial case to uncertainties in the gas surface density profile by using a different set of @xmath1 values ( i.e. , those from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found no qualitative difference .",
    "while the solutions fall into different regions of the parameter space , depending on the exact values for the parameters , the metallicity always reaches higher values for the @xmath67 configuration compared to the @xmath69 configuration .",

    "the key ingredient is the dependence of the accretion stress on the product @xmath66 , as mediated by the hall effect .",
    "when @xmath67 , the resulting @xmath1 values are enhanced and in a steady state , this equates to a lower gas surface density .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath69 ; weaker @xmath1 values lead to higher gas surface densities .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in the @xmath69 case , the gas surface density depends more steeply on radius ( see fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) and in fact is reasonably close to the mmsn profile ( which is particularly intriguing since our own solar system lacks tightly packed , close - in planets , in agreement with the @xmath69 case ) . despite a larger radial drift velocity induced by this steeper profile",
    ", the shallower gas density profile still attains higher solid concentration .",
    "the reasons for this are two - fold .",
    "first , with higher @xmath1 values , the co - accretion of the solids with the gas dominates over radial drift , ensuring that ( given a sufficiently high @xmath50 ) there will always be a relatively large number of solids at small radii , regardless of the value of @xmath30 ( see equation  ( [ vp ] ) ) .",
    "second , the gas surface density is _ lower _ for @xmath67 , which means it is easier to attain relatively large @xmath52 .    in most of the cases explored here , @xmath67 leads to sufficiently high metallicity for @xmath85  au to cause direct gravitational collapse into planetesimals , though the degree to which this is true depends on the value of @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , the inner regions of the disk with @xmath69 fall within the region of parameter space where planetesimal formation is difficult , though this result is even less robust as it depends on both @xmath50 and @xmath38 ( and possibly other parameters not explored here ) .",
    "what is robust , however , is that for @xmath67 , the metallicity at small radii is enhanced , sometimes quite significantly , compared to @xmath69 .",
    "higher metallicity leads to more planetesimals and of larger sizes ( simon et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "thus , even if parameters are such that both magnetic field orientations can lead to planetesimals at small radii , there remains a bimodal distribution in the number and sizes of these planetesimals .",
    "encouragingly , pebble accretion depends on the size of the accreting planetesimals ( kretke , private communication ) , and while one would need planet accretion and dynamical models to strengthen the link between our results and exoplanet observations , the magnetic field geometry may very well be the key to explaining the dichotomy in exoplanet orbital configurations .",
