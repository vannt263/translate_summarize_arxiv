    "there have been remarkable advances in the field of superconductor - based quantum information processing in recent years @xcite .",
    "coherent oscillations and basic gate operations have been observed in systems of single qubits and two interacting qubits @xcite .",
    "one of the most important operations that are used in manipulating qubits is the application of an oscillating external field on resonance with the qubit to drive rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "a closely related problem with great promise of possible applications is that of a qubit coupled to a quantum harmonic - oscillator mode @xcite .",
    "qubits are always coupled to uncontrollable degrees of freedom that cause decoherence in its dynamics .",
    "one generally thinks of the environment as slowly reducing the coherence of the qubit , typically as a monotonically decreasing decay function . in some recent experiments ,",
    "however , oscillations in the qubit have been observed that imply it is strongly coupled to quantum degrees of freedom with long decoherence times @xcite .",
    "the effects of those degrees of freedom have been successfully described by modelling them as quantum two - level systems ( tlss ) @xcite . since , as mentioned above , rabi oscillations are a simple and powerful method to manipulate the quantum state of a qubit , it is important to understand the behaviour of a qubit that is driven on or close to resonance in the presence of such a tls",
    ". furthermore , we shall show below that driving the qubit close to resonance can be used to extract more parameters about an environment of tlss than has been done in experiment so far .",
    "the results of this study are also relevant to the problem of rabi oscillations in a qubit that is interacting with other surrounding qubits .",

    "we perform a more systematic analysis in order to reach a more complete understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "we shall present a few simple physical principles that can be used to understand several aspects of the behaviour of this system with different possible choices of the relevant parameters .",
    "those principles are ( 1 ) the four - level energy spectrum of the qubit+tls system , ( 2 ) the basic properties of the rabi - oscillation dynamics and ( 3 ) the basic effects of decoherence",
    ". we shall then perform numerical calculations that will agree with that intuitive picture and also will reveal other results that are more difficult to definitively predict otherwise .",
    "finally , we suggest an experimental procedure where the driven qubit dynamics can be used to characterize the environment of tlss .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iii we present a few simple arguments that will be used as a foundation for our numerical analysis of sec .",

    "iii ) . in sec .",
    "v we discuss how our results can be used in experiment .",
    "we finally conclude our discussion in sec . vi .",
    "the model system that we shall study in this paper is composed of a harmonically driven qubit , a quantum tls and their weakly coupled environment @xcite .",
    "we assume that the qubit and the tls interact with their own ( uncorrelated ) environments that would cause decoherence even in the absence of qubit - tls coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the qubit and tls hamiltonians , respectively ; @xmath3 describes the coupling between the qubit and the tls , and @xmath4 describes all the degrees of freedom in the environment and their coupling to the qubit and tls .",
    "the ( time - dependent ) qubit hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the adjustable static control parameters of the qubit , @xmath8 are the pauli spin matrices of the qubit , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the amplitude ( in energy units ) and frequency , respectively , of the driving field , and @xmath11 is an angle that describes the orientation of the external field relative to the qubit @xmath12 axis .",
    "although we have used a rather general form to describe the coupling between the qubit and the driving field , we shall see in sec .",
    "iii that one only needs a single , easily extractable parameter to characterize the amplitude of the driving field .",
    "we assume that the tls is not coupled to the external driving field , and its hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath13    where the definition of the parameters and operators is similar to those of the qubit , except that the tls parameters are uncontrollable .",
    "note that our assumption that the tls is not coupled to the driving field can be valid even in cases where the physical nature of the tls and the driving field leads to such coupling , since we generally consider a microscopic tls , rendering any coupling to the external field negligible .",
    "the energy splitting between the two quantum states of each subsystem , in the absence of coupling between them , is given by :    @xmath14    where the index @xmath15 refers to either the qubit or the tls .",
    "the corresponding ground and excited states are , respectively , given by :    @xmath16    where the angle @xmath17 is given by the criterion @xmath18 .",
    "we take the interaction hamiltonian between the qubit and the tls to be of the form :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the ( uncontrollable ) coupling strength between the qubit and the tls .",
    "note that any interaction hamiltonian that is a product of a qubit observable times a tls observable can be recast into the above form using a simple basis transformation , keeping in mind that such a basis transformation also changes the values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that all the coupling terms in @xmath4 are small enough that its effect on the dynamics of the qubit+tls system can be treated within the framework of the markovian bloch - redfield master equation approach .",
    "we shall use a noise power spectrum that can describe both dephasing and relaxation with independently adjustable rates , and shall present our results in term of those decoherence rates . for definiteness in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we take the coupling of the qubit and the tls to their respective environments to be described by the operators @xmath23 , where @xmath15 refers to the qubit and the tls .",
    "note , however , that since we use the relaxation and dephasing rates to quantify decoherence , our results are independent of the choice of system - environment coupling operators .",
    "we start our analysis of the problem by presenting a few physical principles that prove very helpful in intuitively predicting the behaviour of the above - described system .",
    "note that the arguments given in this section are well known @xcite .",
    "for the sake of clarity , however , we present them explicitly and discuss their roles in the problem at hand .      the first element that one needs to consider is the energy levels of the combined qubit+tls system . in order for a given experimental sample to function as a qubit",
    ", the qubit - tls coupling strength @xmath20 must be much smaller than the energy splitting of the qubit @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore take that limit , as well as the limit @xmath25 , and straightforwardly find the energy levels to be given by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 . the corresponding eigenstates are given by :    @xmath29 is given by the criterion @xmath30 , and for definiteness in the form of the states @xmath31 and @xmath32 we have assumed that @xmath33 .",
    "note that the mean - field shift of the qubit resonance frequency , @xmath34 , is present regardless of the values of the qubit and tls energy splittings .",
    "the avoided - crossing structure involving states @xmath35 and @xmath36 , however , is only relevant when the qubit and tls energies are almost equal .",
    "one can therefore use spectroscopy of the four - level structure to experimentally measure the tls energy splitting @xmath37 and angle @xmath22 , as will be discussed in more detail in sec . v.",
    "if a two - level system ( e.g. a qubit ) with energy splitting @xmath38 , initially in its ground state , is driven by a harmonically - oscillating weak field with a frequency @xmath10 close to its energy splitting ( up to a factor of @xmath39 ) as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubithamiltonian ] ) , its probability to be found in the excited state at a later time @xmath40 is given by :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , and the on - resonance rabi frequency @xmath43 ( we take @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "we therefore see that maximum oscillations with full @xmath45 conversion probability are obtained when the driving is resonant with the qubit energy splitting .",
    "we also see that the width of the rabi peak in the frequency domain is given by @xmath46 .",
    "simple rabi oscillations can also be observed in a multi - level system if the driving frequency is on resonance with one of the relevant energy splittings but off resonance with all others .      in an undriven system ,",
    "the effect of decoherence is to push the density matrix describing the system towards its thermal - equilibrium value with time scales given by the characteristic dephasing and relaxation times .",
    "the effects of decoherence , especially dephasing , can be thought of in terms of a broadening of the energy levels . in particular , if the energy separation between the states @xmath31 and @xmath47 of sec .",
    "iii - a is smaller than the typical decoherence rates in the problem , any effect related to that energy separation becomes unobservable .",
    "alternatively , one could say that only processes that occur on a time scale faster than the decoherence times can be observed .",
    "it is worth taking a moment to look in some more detail at the problem of a resonantly - driven qubit coupled to a dissipative environment , which is usually studied under the name of bloch - equations @xcite .",
    "if the rabi frequency is much smaller than the decoherence rates , the qubit will remain in its thermal equilibrium state , since any deviations from that state caused by the driving field will be dissipated immediately . if , on the other hand , the rabi frequency is much larger than the decoherence rates , the system will perform damped rabi oscillations , and it will end up close to the maximally mixed state in which both states @xmath48 and @xmath49 have equal occupation probability . in that case , one could say that decoherence succeeds in making us lose track of the quantum state of the qubit but fails to dissipate the energy of the qubit , since more energy will always be available from the driving field .",
    "we now take the three elements presented above and combine them to obtain a simple intuitive picture of the problem at hand .",
    "let us for a moment neglect the effects of decoherence and only consider the case @xmath50 .",
    "the driving field tries to flip the state of the qubit alone .",
    "however , two of the relevant eigenstates are entangled states , namely @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "one can therefore expect that if the width of the rabi peak , or in other words the on - resonance rabi frequency , is much larger than the energy separation between the states @xmath31 and @xmath47 , the qubit will start oscillating much faster than the tls can respond , and the initial dynamics will look similar to that of the uncoupled system . only after many oscillations and a time of the order of @xmath51 will one start to see the effects of the qubit - tls interaction .",
    "if , on the other hand , the rabi frequency is much smaller than the energy separation between the states @xmath31 and @xmath47 , the driving field can excite at most one of those two states , depending on the driving frequency . in that case",
    "the qubit - tls interactions are strong enough that the tls can follow adiabatically the time evolution of the qubit . in the intermediate region",
    ", one expects that if the driving frequency is closer to one of the two transition frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 , beating behaviour will be seen right from the beginning .",
    "if one looks at the rabi peak in the frequency domain , e.g. by plotting the maximum @xmath54 qubit - state conversion probability as a function of frequency , the single peak of the weak - coupling limit separates into two peaks as the qubit - tls coupling strength becomes comparable to and exceeds the on - resonance rabi frequency .    we do not expect weak to moderate levels of decoherence to cause any qualitative changes in the qubit dynamics other than , for example , imposing a decaying envelope on the qubit excitation probability .",
    "as mentioned above , features that are narrower ( in frequency ) than the decoherence rates will be suppressed the most .",
    "note that if the tls decoherence rates are large enough @xcite , the tls can be neglected and one recovers the single rabi peak with a height determined by the qubit decoherence rates alone .",
    "in the absence of decoherence , we find it easiest to treat the problem at hand using the dressed - state picture @xcite . in that picture",
    "one thinks of the driving field mode as being quantized , and processes are described as involving the absorption and emission of quantized photons by the qubit+tls combined system . as a representative case , which also happens to be the case of most interest to us , we take the frequency of the driving field to be close to the qubit and tls energy splittings . for simplicity , we take those to be equal . we shall come back to the general case later in this section . without going over the rather simple details of the derivation ,",
    "we show the four relevant energy levels and the possible transitions in fig .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the dynamics within those four levels is given by :    @xmath55     left : energy levels and direct transitions between them in the dressed - state picture .",
    "right : energy splittings separated according to their physical origin.,width=321 ]    where @xmath56 , @xmath46 is the on - resonance rabi frequency in the absence of qubit - tls coupling , @xmath57 , and the hamiltonian is expressed in the basis of states @xmath58 without the need for any extra initialization .",
    "we can now evolve the system numerically and analyze the dynamics . after we find the density matrix of the combined qubit+tls system as a function of time",
    ", we can look at the dynamics of the combined system or that of the two subsystems separately , depending on which one provides more insightful information .",
    "we start by demonstrating the separation of the rabi peak into two peaks as the qubit - tls coupling strength is increased . as a quantifier of the amplitude of rabi oscillations , we use the maximum probability for the qubit to be found in the excited state between times @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and we refer to that quantity as @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath61 as a function of renormalized detuning @xmath62 . as was explained in sec .",
    "iii , the peak separates into two when the qubit - tls coupling strength exceeds the on - resonance rabi frequency , up to simple factors of order one .",
    "the system also behaves according to the explanation given in sec .",
    "iii in the weak- and strong - coupling limits .",
    "when @xmath20 is substantially smaller than @xmath46 , oscillations in the qubit state occur on a time scale @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the rabi frequency defined in sec .",
    "iii - b , whereas the beating behaviour occurs on a time scale @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath20 is more than an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath46 , the effects of the tls are hardly visible in the qubit dynamics within the time given above . on the other hand , when @xmath20 is large enough such that the energy difference @xmath65 is several times larger than @xmath46 , the dynamics corresponds to exciting at most one of the two eigenstates @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we generally see that beating behaviour becomes less pronounced when the driving frequency is equal to the qubit energy splitting including the tls - mean field shift , i.e. when @xmath66 , which corresponds to the top of the unsplit single peak or the midpoint between the two separated peaks .     between @xmath59 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 0.5 ( a ) , 2 ( b ) , 2.5 ( c ) and 5 ( d ) .",

    "in fact , for further demonstration that this is the case , we have included in fig .",
    "4 the probability of the combined qubit+tls system to be in state @xmath79 .",
    "this peak is easiest to observe in the intermediate coupling regime . in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "the qubit and tls are essentially decoupled , especially on the time scale of qubit dynamics . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", one can argue that a raman transition will give rise to that peak .",
    "however , noting that the width of that peak is of the order of the smaller of the values @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we can see that it becomes increasingly narrow in that limit .",
    "in other words , the virtual intermediate state after the absorption of one photon is far enough in energy from the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 to make the peak invisibly narrow .",
    "it is rather surprising , however , that in the intermediate - coupling regime the peak reaches unit @xmath54 conversion probability , even though the transitions to states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are real , rather than being virtual transitions whose role is merely to mediate the coupling between states @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we have verified that the ( almost ) unit height of the peak is quite robust against changes in the angles @xmath82 and @xmath22 for a wide range in @xmath20 , even when that peak coincides with the top of one of the two main peaks .",

    "we therefore study the effects of decoherence by treating the driving field classically .",
    "we then solve a bloch - redfield master equation with a time - dependent hamiltonian and externally - imposed dephasing and relaxation times , as was done in ref .",

    "5 we reproduce the four - level results of fig .",
    "3 , i.e. @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 with no decoherence , along with the same quantity obtained when we take into account the effects of decoherence . for a moderate level of decoherence",
    ", we see that the qubit excitation probability is somewhat reduced and all the features that are narrower than the decoherence rates are suppressed partially or completely by the effects of decoherence . for large qubit decoherence rates ,",
    "the qubit excitation probability is greatly reduced close to resonance , where the rabi frequency @xmath64 takes its lowest values .",
    "the shallow dip in the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "( 5 ) occurs because for those frequencies and in the absence of decoherence the maximum amplitude is only reached after several oscillations , whereas it is reached during the first few oscillations outside that region . for large tls decoherence rates , the tls becomes weakly coupled to the qubit , and a single peak is recovered in the qubit dynamics ( with a height larger than either the two split peaks ) .",
    "all of these effects are in agreement with the simple picture presented in sec .",
    "in the early experiments on phase qubits coupled to tlss @xcite , the qubit relaxation rate @xmath95 ( @xmath9640mhz ) was comparable to the splitting between the two rabi peaks @xmath97 ( @xmath9620 - 70mhz ) , whereas the on - resonance rabi frequency @xmath46 was tunable from 30mhz to 400mhz ( note that , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii , the rabi frequency can not be reduced to values much lower than the decoherence rates , or rabi oscillations would disappear altogether ) .",
    "the large relaxation rates in those experiments would make several effects discussed in this paper unobservable .",
    "the constraint that @xmath46 could not be reduced below 30mhz made the strong - coupling regime , where @xmath98 , inaccessible .",
    "the weak - coupling regime , where @xmath99 , was easily accessible in those experiments .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , it shows only a minor signature of the tls . although the intermediate - coupling regime was also accessible , as evidenced by the observation of the splitting of the rabi peak into two peaks , observation of the two - photon process and the additional dips of fig .",
    "2 discussed above would have required a time at least comparable to the qubit relaxation time . that would have made them difficult to distinguish from experimental fluctuations .    with the new qubit design of ref .",
    "@xcite , the qubit relaxation time has been increased by a factor of 20 .",
    "the constraint that @xmath46 must be at least comparable to @xmath100 no longer prevents accessibility of the strong - coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , since our simulations were run for a period of time corresponding to approximately ten rabi oscillation cycles , i.e. shorter than the relaxation time observed in that experiment , all the effects that were discussed above should be observable , including the observation of the two - photon peak and the transition from the weak- to the strong - coupling regimes by varying the driving amplitude .",
    "we finally consider one possible application of our results to experiments on phase qubits , namely the problem of characterizing the environment composed of tlss .",
    "as we shall show shortly , characterizing the tls parameters and the nature of the qubit - tls coupling are not independent questions .",
    "the energy splitting of a given tls , @xmath37 , can be obtained easily from the location of the qubit - tls resonance as the qubit energy splitting is varied .",
    "one can then obtain the distribution of values of @xmath101 for a large number of tlss , as was in fact done in ref .",
    "the splitting of the rabi resonance peak into two peaks by itself , however , is insufficient to determine the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 separately . by observing the location of the two - photon peak , in addition to the locations of the two main peaks",
    ", one would be able to determine both @xmath34 and @xmath97 for a given tls , as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 . those values can then be used to calculate both @xmath37 and @xmath104 of that tls .",
    "the distribution of values of @xmath22 can then be used to test models of the environment , such as the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to reach the above conclusion , we have made the assumption that the distribution of values of @xmath22 for those tlss with sufficiently strong coupling to the qubit is representative of all tlss . since it is generally believed that strong coupling is a result of proximity to the junction , the above assumption is quite plausible , as long as the other tlss share the same nature .",
    "although it is possible that there might be two different types of tlss of different nature in a qubit s environment , identifying that possibility would also be helpful in understanding the nature of the environment .",
    "we have also assumed that @xmath21 does not take the special value @xmath105 ( note that , based on the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite , we are also assuming that generally @xmath106 )",
    ". that assumption would not raise any concern when dealing with charge or flux qubits , where both @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be adjusted in a single experiment , provided an appropriate design is used .",
    "however , the situation is trickier with phase qubits .",
    "the results in that case depend on the nature of the qubit - tls coupling , which we discuss next .",
    "the two mechanisms that are currently considered the most likely candidates to describe the qubit - tls coupling are through either ( 1 ) a dependence of the josephson junction s critical current on the tls state or ( 2 ) coulomb interactions between a charged tls and the charge across the junction . in the former case , one has an effective value of @xmath21 that is different from @xmath105 @xcite , and the assumption of an intermediate value of @xmath21 is justified . in the case of coupling through coulomb interactions , on the other hand , one effectively has @xmath107 , and therefore @xmath34 vanishes for all the tlss . in that case",
    "the two - photon peak would always appear at the midpoint ( to a good approximation ) between the two main rabi peaks .",
    "although that would prevent the determination of the distribution of values of @xmath22 , it would be a strong indication that coulomb interactions with the charge across the junction are responsible for the qubit - tls coupling rather than the critical current dependence on the tls state .",
    "note also that if it turns out that this is in fact the case , and the distribution of values of @xmath22 can not be extracted from the experimental results , that distribution might be irrelevant to the question of decoherence in phase qubits .",
    "we have studied the problem of a harmonically - driven qubit that is interacting with an uncontrollable two - level system and a background environment .",
    "we have presented a simple picture to understand the majority of the phenomena that are observed in this system .",
    "that picture is composed of three elements : ( 1 ) the four - level energy spectrum of the qubit+tls system , ( 2 ) the basic properties of the rabi - oscillation dynamics and ( 3 ) the basic effects of decoherence .",
    "we have confirmed the predictions of that picture using a systematic numerical analysis where we have varied a number of relevant parameters .",
    "we have also found unexpected features in the resonance - peak structure .",
    "we have analyzed the behaviour of the system and provided simple explanations in those cases as well .",
    "our results can be tested with available experimental systems .",
    "furthermore , they can be used in experimental attempts to characterize the tlss surrounding a qubit , which can then be used as part of possible techniques to eliminate the tlss detrimental effects on the qubit operation .",
