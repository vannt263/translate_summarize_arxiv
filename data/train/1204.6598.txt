    "the solar atmosphere contains a range of highly dynamic features , e.g. flares , jets , spicules , etc . in order to fully observe these events , requires high cadence , high spatial and high spectral resolution instruments .",
    "however , due to various scientific and technical considerations , trade - offs in the instrument design must be made by the investigators .",
    "milli - second data is commonly acquired in the radio and hard x - rays frequencies , while at ultraviolet wavelengths , high cadence is generally not available with most ultraviolet spectrographs . the highest cadence uv spectrometer to date was the ultraviolet spectrometer and polarimeter ( uvsp )",
    "which was flown on the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) _ in the early 1980 s .",
    "several flares were observed simultaneously in the uv at selected individual spectral lines , e.g. o  v  1371   , si  iv  1394    etc , and at hard x - ray energies of several kev .",
    "several papers reported simultaneous ( to within a fraction of a second ) increases in the uv lines and at hard x - ray energies ( cheng  1981 , woodgate  1983 , poland  1984 , cheng  1984 ) .",
    "a more in - depth study by cheng  ( 1988 ) found that bursts observed in the o  v  1371    line lagged the hard x - ray bursts by only 0.3 s to 0.7 s. no firm explanation was given for such a fast rise in the uv line flux .",
    "none of the various spectrographs launched since smm has had the ability to obtain high cadence spectral data .",
    "however , that will shortly change with the launch of the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) which is centered on four themes relating to solar physics and space weather , namely : which types of non - thermal energy dominate in the chromosphere and beyond , how does the chromosphere regulate mass and energy supply to the corona and heliosphere and how does magnetic flux and matter rise through the lower atmosphere , and what role does flux emergence play in flares and mass ejections ? the spectrograph will have the ability to obtain spectra with a cadence down to 1  s in several transition region line including the intense si  iv line at 1394  ",
    ".    such high cadence spectral data has the potential to provide diagnostic information on the plasma s electron temperature and density .",
    "to do so requires transient ionization considerations . as a test on the diagnostic potential we analyze one of the flares observed by smm , making use of the atomic data and analysis structure ( adas ; summers , 2009 ) framework , which is a collection of fundamental and derived atomic data , and codes that manipulate them ..    in section 2 , we briefly outline past observations and findings on the temporal and spatial correlation between hxr and uv emissions during solar flares and the high cadence uvsp data used in this paper , while in section 3 , we outline the atomic background , give details on a full time - dependent calculation and comparing it to the results obtained for the radiative power assuming steady state in section 4 . here",
    ", we only consider an atomic model , i.e. we assume that the plasma is instantaneously heated from a cold plasma at @xmath0 k to temperatures @xmath1 k. we do not consider movement of plasma nor a model atmosphere , as was done for comparison with jet - like features by roussev  ( 2001 ) , doyle  ( 2002 ) .",
    "most radiated power loss calculations are done on the basis of a steady - state ionization balance assumption , which is relatively simple and is often used in circumstances which are not fully justified .",
    "non - equilibrium ionization occurs when the plasma electron temperature or electron density changes on a timescale , @xmath2 , shorter than the atomic ionization stage fractional abundance relaxation timescale , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the ionization stage of a specific element ) , or when the time for plasma transport across a temperature or density scale length is shorter than @xmath3 . in the present work ,",
    "the first case is considered .",
    "following mcwhirter ( 1965 ) , for an ionizing plasma , @xmath3 represents the relaxation time for a plasma to reach ionization equilibrium .",
    "transient ionization was considered by doschek and tanaka ( 1987 ) for @xmath5 k flare phase while raymond ( 1990 ) looked at its effect for a micro - flare heated corona . in each instance , these authors noted a flux enhancement resulting from transient ionization considerations . due to the general lack of high time resolution uv line flux observations ,",
    "whether from flares or active regions , this aspect is not generally appreciated . in the present work",
    "the importance of non - equilibrium ionization is shown comparing the o  v  1371  line emission enhancement ( with respect to equilibrium ) predicted by a model with the observation of a flare which occurred on 2 november 1980 ( poland  1984 ) .",
    "and the red line is the sum of all the bursts ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the lower plot displays the o  v line light curve together with the hard x - ray emission to show the correlation between the o  v bursts and the hard x - ray pulses.,width=453 ]",
    "the relationship between hxr and uv emissions during flares has been investigated since the early 70s ( kane and donnelly ( 1971 ) and references therein ) , using broadband euv emission .",
    "later poland  ( 1984 ) and cheng  ( 1981 , 1988 ) found a strong temporal correlation between hxr emission at 25100 kev and the o  v  1371    emission , which peak at 25 ev ( @xmath6 @xmath7 k ) , during the impulsive phase of solar flares .",
    "they used simultaneous observations obtained by the hard x - ray burst spectrometer ( hxrbs ) and ultraviolet spectrometer polarimeter ( uvsp ) on the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) _ satellite .",
    "the hxrbs had a temporal resolution of 0.128 s , but no spatial resolution , so it gave hxr emission from the entire sun , while the o  v emission was from the pixels showing flare enhancements .",
    "poland  ( 1984 ) studied the temporal correlation between the hxr and o  v emissions using a sample of 17 flares , finding a well defined relation between the two emissions for a given flare .",
    "however , this relation varies from one flare to the next .",
    "they analysed the observations in the context of a single loop model heated by a high - energy electron beam .",
    "the beam is accelerated down to the foot - points in the chromosphere . here",
    "the beam collides with the cool chromospheric plasma and yields hxr bremsstrahlung emission , which heats the plasma through the coulomb collision with the electrons .",
    "the plasma heated to transition region temperature gives increased o  v emission .",
    "they concluded that there is a strong physical relationship between the processes which give rise to the non - thermal hxr emission and the apparently thermal uv emission .",
    "however , while they could predict with their models the general behaviour of o  v emission compared to the hxr , they did not reproduce the magnitude and detailed behaviour .",
    "a close time correspondence between the hxr and o  v emissions was found also by cheng  ( 1988 ) , who analysed five flare events .",
    "their cross - correlation analysis showed that the fast features of o  v generally lag behind the corresponding hxr features by 0.3 - 0.7 s. a revisit of the relationship between the uv and hxr emissions in flares was done by warren and warshall ( 2001 ) .",
    "they studied nine flares , using data from it trace , it yohkoh hard x - ray telescope and burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    ", with a cadence of 23 s. for five of the nine flares their observations allowed the spatial analysis of the hxr sources ( with a spatial resolution of 8) , finding for 2 flares a spatial separation between the hxr and uv sources .",
    "further detailed studies on both temporal and spatial correlation between the hxr and uv emission in flares have been done by alexander and coyner ( 2006 ) and coyner and alexander ( 2009 ) .",
    "they incorporated the improved spatial and temporal resolution of it trace ( focusing on the 1600    observations ) and rhessi .",
    "the latter allows the examination of spatial hxr structures with a resolution of 2 , while it permits a time resolution of tens of milliseconds .",
    "however , the temporal analysis was limited by the it trace cadence of 2 s. they investigated the spatially integrated uv and hxr time profiles .",
    "in addition , they compared the individual uv sources ( or group sources ) with both the overall hxr time evolution and the individual impulsive x - ray bursts .",
    "finally , they performed a spatial association between the spatial resolved uv and hxr sources .",
    "alexander and coyner ( 2006 ) focused on a particular flare , which occurred on 2002 july 16 and found a good temporal correlation between the spatially integrated uv and hxr emissions ( as found by previous authors ) , but different temporal and spatial correlation for the individual sources .",
    "three main conclusions arose from their work : + ( i ) the strong overall correlation between the uv and hxr emissions suggests that these two different emissions must result from the same energy release process or a strictly related processes ; + ( ii ) the separation of the uv emission into individual sources provided examination of the various contributing components to the overall temporal behaviour and suggests a more complicated overall picture of solar flares than the single loop models of previous work ; + ( iii ) the lack of spatial correlation for some uv and hxr sources suggests a three - dimensional magnetic topology .",
    "coyner and alexander ( 2009 ) improved the analysis of alexander and coyner ( 2006 ) investigating the behaviour of temporal and spatial uv and hxr emissions in a large sample of solar flares .",
    "they found that the hxr emission characterized by multiple impulsive bursts , that each individual burst corresponds to independent spatially disconnected sets of hxr foot - points .",
    "these sources are localized and are co - spatial with some of the uv sources . however , while the hxr sources are compact and localized , the uv emission is more diffuse and persists throughout the entire flaring region .",
    "they noticed that some uv sources were not co - spatial but were co - temporal with respect to the hxr sources and some other uv sources showed neither co - spatial nor co - temporal emission compared to hxr sources .",
    "they explained the temporal but non - spatial correlation between some uv and the hxr sources , suggesting a three - dimensional magnetic field morphology , again more complex than single - loop models . concerning the spatially and temporally uncorrelated uv emission",
    ", they pointed out that these signatures indicate two distinct types of uv response , one consistent with the hxr emission and one of a likely thermal origin ( which may be indicated by the significant correlation with soft x - ray emission at 6 - 25 kev instead of the hxr at 25 - 100 kev ) .",
    "they concluded that in solar flares the structure of the magnetic field must be a complex three - dimensional structure and that there are multiple processes involved in the uv emission production .",
    "in summary individual bursts in the hxr time profile are related to disconnected sets of hxr foot - points and that a probable origin of the hxr emission is related to electrons ( and ions ) accelerated in the corona , traveling to the foot - points in the chromosphere .",
    "here these electrons heat the plasma up to transition region temperature producing the uv emission .",
    "+ there are three types of relationship between uv and hxr emission : + ( 1 ) co - temporal and co - spatial uv and hxr emissions ; + ( 2 ) co - temporal but non co - spatial uv and hxr emissions ; + ( 3 ) neither co - temporal nor co - spatial uv and hxr emissions .",
    "+ the first type of relationship , that is the existence of localized hxr emission co - spatial with temporally correlated uv emission sources , is consistent with models where both emissions result from different portions of an accelerated electron population .",
    "the second type of relationship , that is spatially separated but temporally correlated uv and hxr emissions , is consistent with a picture of a spatially complex magnetic geometry for solar flares , different from a single loop model .",
    "the third type of relationship , that is spatially and temporally uncorrelated uv and hxr emissions , is consistent with the presence of two distinct mechanisms each producing uv emission ( e.g. one consistent with hxr origin and dependent on it and one of a likely thermal origin and independent of hxr emission ) .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrometer and polarimeter ( uvsp ) is described by woodgate ( 1980 ) , while details on the hard x - ray burst spectrometer ( hxrbs ) is given by orwing  ( 1980 ) . for the flare observations discussed here , the entrance aperture was 10 , with an exit slit of 0.3    centered at o  v  1371   . in response to an alert from another onboard instrument ,",
    "the uvsp began making rasters covering 30  @xmath8 30 . in some of the earlier uvsp / hxrbs flare observations ,",
    "the uvsp data was taken with a 1.3 s cadence and in order to compare the two datasets , the uvsp data was interpolated at the finer hxrbs time resolution of 0.128 s. however , in most of the later observations , both datasets were observed using a 0.128 s cadence . in order to improve the s / n , several of the bright uvsp pixels were added .    of the various papers which reported the almost simultaneous uv / hard x - ray bursts , cheng  ( 1988 ) did a detailed filtering with a cross correlation analysis .",
    "these authors established that the o  v  1371    line lagged the hard x - ray burst by 0.3 to 0.7 s , and was flare dependent . here , we use this data to show the diagnostic potential of high cadence uv spectral data . in fig .  1",
    ", we reproduce data from poland  ( 1984 ) of a flare which occurred on 2 november 1980 .",
    "to predict the line emissivities and ion population densities , the generalized collisional - radiative ( gcr ) theory as implemented in adas , the atomic data and analysis structure ( mcwhirter and summers , 1984 ; summers , 2009 ) , is used in this work . each ion in an optically thin plasma is described by a complete set of levels with collisional and radiative couplings between them .",
    "all radiative and electron collisional processes are included in the model , except for photon - induced processes .",
    "state - resolved direct ionization and recombination to and from the next ionization stage are also taken into account .",
    "in addition , due to the much shorter relaxation timescales for the excited states ( not metastables ) with respect to the ground and metastable states , it is assumed that the dominant populations lie in the ground and metastable states of the ion . over the considered temperature and density regime ,",
    "the ratio in the population of the metastable state @xmath9 compared to the ground state @xmath10 of o  v is typically less than @xmath11 .",
    "hence the dominant population is concentrated in the ground state .    in a time - dependent plasma model",
    "the line emissivity is no longer a unique function of the local temperature and density conditions but depends on the past history of the temperature , density and state of ionization of the plasma .",
    "therefore , the assumption of ionization equilibrium in calculating the ionization balance is not appropriate and time - dependent fractional abundances must be determined .",
    "the time dependence of ionization stage populations , @xmath12 , leads to the following equation : @xmath13 \\label{ion_time_evol}\\ ] ] where the presence of metastable states is neglected because of the previous consideration . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the collisional - dielectronic ionization and recombination coefficients .",
    "they give the contribution to the growth rates for the ground state population , due to the effective ionization , which includes direct and excitation / auto - ionization contributions , and the effective recombination , which includes radiative , dielectronic and three - body contributions .",
    "the values of these coefficients , currently within the adas database , have been obtained following the gcr approach as described in summers  ( 2006 ) .",
    "the solution of equation [ ion_time_evol ] is such that the number density of the element of a nuclear charge @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "the time - dependent fractional abundances @xmath19 are calculated as follows : the code derives the solution for a range of fixed plasma electron temperature and density pairs , starting from an initial population distribution @xmath20 ( see section [ burst_model ] ) using an eigenvalue approach .",
    "the line emissivity is given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the abundance of the element @xmath16 relative to hydrogen , @xmath23 is tabulated by mcwhirter  ( 1975 ) and @xmath24 is the time - dependent contribution function defined as : @xmath25    where    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the transition probability @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the population densities of the ground states of the ions of charge @xmath4 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the effective contributions to the population of the upper excited state @xmath33 .",
    "further details on the gcr may be found in lanza  ( 2001 )",
    "the main goal of this work is the analysis of the effects of a plasma not being in ionization equilibrium due to rapid heating that is faster than the ionization / recombination timescales .",
    "the issue is addressed considering each burst ( 10 in this case , see fig .",
    "1 ) as an independent entity , which is assumed to originate as a consequence of a plasma heating at the foot of a loop in a multiple loop structure .",
    "whether this energy release results from a non - thermal electron beam , and/or a conduction front is not the subject of this paper .",
    "the calculations performed for this work consider only the plasma response to sudden heating with no mass motions allowed .    using the above considerations on the strong physical link between the hxr emission and the o  v  1371  emission ,",
    "the initial conditions for the plasma evolution are stated ( see table  1 ) . for each burst",
    "it has been assumed that at time @xmath34 , the plasma is in ionization equilibrium at an electron temperature in the range @xmath35  k and the electron density in the range @xmath36  @xmath37 ( typical values of the solar chromosphere ) .",
    "using these initial conditions , the whole population of oxygen lies in the first four ionization stages ( o  i - o  iv ) and is concentrated essentially in the second and third ionization stages ( o  ii and o  iii ) , as shown in table [ initial_population ] .",
    "this table lists only the range of the initial temperatures and densities considered because these initial conditions do not significantly affect the late plasma evolution when the spectral lines observed are emitted .",
    "they depend strongly only on the final temperatures and densities .",

    "this relaxation time characterizes the time to reach ionization equilibrium and is defined as the reciprocal of the product of electron density and the sum of ionization and recombination coefficients relative to the considered ionization stages : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ionization stage with which the o  v  1371   line is concerned , @xmath44 denotes the effective ionization coefficient and @xmath45 the effective recombination coefficient .",

    "figure [ intersec ] displays an example for bursts 4 and 7 .",
    "the lines with @xmath51 constant ( solid lines ) , corresponding to the decay times of the fourth and seventh bursts , intersect the lines with @xmath52 constant ( dashed lines ) , corresponding to the peak values of the two considered bursts .",

    "the white points represent the intersection with the @xmath52=constant lines for each burst .",
    "the whole set of points lies in a region of quasi - constant electron temperature ( @xmath55  k ) , while there is a larger spread in the electron density domain ( @xmath56  @xmath37 ) , see also figure [ temp_dens_rel ] .",
    "this figure shows that near to the highest peak ( i.e. burst 7 , figure  1 ) , the density is high while the relaxation time has one of the lowest values .",
    "the longest relaxation times are related to the first burst ( burst 1 ) and last burst ( burst 10 ) .",
    "the latter is evidence of the slow decrease in the intensity of o  v after the flare event due to the plasma relaxation until it reaches equilibrium conditions .",
    "figure [ temperature_evolution_at_time_peak_col ] shows the contribution functions as a function of electron temperature .",
    "note the much larger contribution function resulting solely from transient ionization .",
    "the dashed lines represent the instantaneous contribution functions calculated at the time where each burst peaks using the respective electron densities and the solid lines are the equilibrium contribution functions calculated at the same densities .",
    "the non - equilibrium contribution functions peak between @xmath57  k while the equilibrium contribution functions peak at @xmath58  k.    the final model to reconstruct the time evolution of each burst has been built up considering the following relation between the line emissivity calculated in non - equilibrium conditions at a fixed pair of electron temperature , and electron density and equilibrium line emissivity calculated for the same ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) pair : @xmath59 where @xmath33 is the burst number .",
    "equation [ e_ratio ] provides the enhancement factor due to transient ionization with respect to the equilibrium conditions , see the red line in figure [ model_burst_envelope ] which is the sum of all the bursts .    in the previous section we used initial temperatures and densities typical of the solar chromosphere , in order to check the sensitivity of these values we performed additional calculations for one burst ,",
    "in this instance burst 3 .",
    "this burst showed an observed enhancement factor of about 3 and a decay time of about 6  s. it is possible to reproduce these values with a final @xmath60 @xmath37 and @xmath61 k. increasing the final temperature to @xmath62 k ( with the initial temperature still in the range @xmath35 k ) , and a final electron density in the range @xmath63 to @xmath64 , the enhancement factors becomes @xmath65 to @xmath62 instead of 3 , while the decay times decreases from about 2  s to less than 0.01  s as the density increases . changing the initial temperature to @xmath65 k , only results in the final values changing by a few percentage .",
    "this means that in order to re - produce the observed enhancement and decay time , these initial conditions are appropriate .",
    "the conclusion from the results given above is that even a small departure from ionization equilibrium can result in an enhancement of the o  v  1371    line emission compared to the intensity calculated in ionization equilibrium .",
    "the present model reproduces the time evolution of each burst , although some issues need further investigation , e.g. it is noted that all the derived points in fig .",
    "[ contour_tau_t_n ] lie in a very small temperature range .",
    "thus more observations , together with a statistical analysis are needed to investigate whether this temperature behavior is the same for other flares .",
    "this study assumes a maxwellian electron distribution , which is justified by the substantially shorter average electron - electron energy relaxation time compared with the observed plasma development and with the theoretical ionisation stage ( ground and metastables ) relaxation times .",
    "however , the differential variation of electron  electron relaxation , especially to higher energies could allow a substantial cohort of fast electrons to confuse interpretation .",
    "it is unlikely that a sufficient set of line observations will be available for the solar atmosphere to explore this , however , it is hoped that parallel studies in tokamak divertor transients will clarify experimentally the non - maxwellian spectral indicators .",
    "what this work clearly shows is that observed transition region line intensity increases on a sub - second time - scale can be explained via transient ionization .",
    "the response time is electron density dependent , explaining the reported o  v / hxr time delays of cheng  ( 1988 ) .",
    "this work has implications not only for high cadence flare observations , but high cadence observations of other dynamic solar features ( doyle  2006 , madjarska  2009 ) .",
    "there are currently no spectrographs capable of sufficiently high cadence observations , although the selected iris mission ( launch date 2012 ) will be capable of obtaining such data for a range of transition region lines including si  iv  1394     and o  iv  1401   .",
    "the contribution functions for these two lines behave differently theoretically under transient ionization , with si  iv  1398   more like o  v  1371 .",
    "both of these lines are in the ground state spin system .",
    "the o  iv  1401  line s upper state is in the quartet ( metastable ) spin system .",
    "transient ionisation under - fills the population structure of the alternate spin systems from the ground .",
    "by contrast the ground spin system population structure is enhanced with the exponential factors in the rate coefficients largely unwound because of the increased electron temperature .",
