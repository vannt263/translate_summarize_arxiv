    "the treatment of uniplanar degeneracies follows @xcite .",
    "we have to make one further additional assumption related to the shape of certain curves on the fresnel surface near the degenerate point . to be precise , we either require that @xmath495 for @xmath496 an open neighbourhood of the uniplanarly degenerate point and for any plane @xmath497 sufficiently close and parallel to the common tangent plane at the unode .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the technical assumption ( 1.12 ) made in @xcite if is violated , we need to consider sugimoto indices @xmath498 , i.e. , contact orders of these planar curves with its tangent planes combined with a uniformity assumption . under assumption",
    "the index is given by @xmath499 .",
    "for cubic media we have to use the statement of proposition  [ prop:3:6 ] to determine the index @xmath500 . using the notation of",
    ", it suffices to calculate the indices of the indicator curves determined by @xmath501 .",
    "this yields @xmath502 in the nearly isotropic case we have @xmath499 , away from it @xmath503 .",
    "both are generic , while the borderline case with @xmath504 is not .",
    "the asymptotic construction of the eigenvalues and eigenprojections near the uniplanarly degenerate point of proposition  [ prop:3.7 ] yields that the assumption is satisfied uniformly for the phase functions appearing in all dyadic components of the operator .",
    "[ thm:4.4 ] assume @xmath478 , @xmath479 and @xmath480 are micro - locally supported in a sufficiently small conical neighbourhood of a uniplanarly degenerate point on @xmath481 .",
    "let further @xmath500 be the index of the uniplanar point .",
    "then the corresponding solution to the thermo - elastic system for cubic media satisfies the a - priori estimate @xmath505 for @xmath436 $ ] , @xmath437 and @xmath483 .",
    "we will sketch the major differences to the treatment of conic degeneracies .",
    "we will again use polar co - ordinates and estimate corresponding dyadic components , where now @xmath490 is determined by proposition  [ prop:3.7 ] .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath490 vanishes to third order and is of no benefit , while the real part coincides to third order with the corresponding elastic eigenvalue .",
    "this allows to use estimates from @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "the main difference to the previous situation is that we now use stationary phase estimates for both , the angular and the radial integral .",
    "the proof itself then coincides with the corresponding proof for cubic elasticity , cf .",
    "@xcite .    using a change of variables the integral",
    "is written in the new variables @xmath506 ( i.e. , roughly @xmath507 ) and @xmath508 . in this form",
    "the phase splits and the crucial estimate is just a fourier transform of a density carried by the sheet of the fresnel surface ( with possible singularity in the unode ) .",
    "this is calculated by introducing _",
    "distorted _ polar co - ordinates on the surface . as level sets we use cuts of the surface by planes parallel to the common tangent plane .",
    "then we will at first apply the method of stationary phase to the radial variable in these co - ordinates .",
    "these stationary points are non - degenerate and we use the obtained first terms in the asymptotics for a second stationary phase argument in the angular variables . the condition would imply again that stationary points are non - degenerate and we are done , while if is violated we use the lemma of van der corput instead to prove the estimate .",
    "it remains to collect all the estimates into a final statement for cubic media .",
    "parabolic directions are treated by lemma  [ lem:4.1 ] ; hyperbolic manifolds away from degenerate points are covered by theorem  [ thm:4.2 ] .",
    "the remaining 24 degenerate directions fall into either of the previously discussed categories and estimates follow from theorem  [ thm:4.3 ] and  [ thm:4.4 ] .",
