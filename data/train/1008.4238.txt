    "the issue of the validity of the ( weak version of the ) cosmic censorship conjecture remains one of the most important open problems in classical general relativity .",
    "roughly speaking , it says that physically admissible solutions to the einstein equations should not contain naked singularites , that is , all singularities formed in physically reasonable scenarios of gravitational collapse should be surrounded by event horizons and , hence , can not send signals to far observers at future null infinity .",
    "a precise formulation of the conjecture can be found in @xcite , together with the properties required on a solution to qualify as a physically `` reasonable '' process of singularity formation .",
    "these properties concern the smoothness and genericity of the initial conditions , and demand that the matter model undergoing collapse can not form singularities of non - gravitational origin .",
    "even though the conjecture is still far from being proven in general , no definitive counter - example has been found so far , neither in numerical simulations nor in analytical investigations .",
    "an important step forward in this respect was the numerical analysis of the threshold for black hole formation .",
    "after the pioneering work of choptuik @xcite it has become clear that it is possible to form a naked singularity by fine - tuning ( smooth ) initial conditions toward the vicinity of the threshold of formation of arbitrarily small black holes .",
    "it turns out that the process is dynamically controlled by an unstable exact solution referred to as a _",
    "critical solution_ which , itself , does contain a naked singularity .",
    "the fine - tuning is required to compensate for the instability of this solution and achieve a continuous approach to that solution . in that set - up",
    ", there is no dynamical formation of naked singularities and , therefore , this analysis does not provide a genuine counter - example to cosmic censorship .",
    "( see @xcite for a review . )    in parallel to choptuik s work on the critical collapse of a real massless scalar field in spherical symmetry , christodoulou @xcite studied the einstein - scalar field equations from a fully analytical point of view . in a truly remarkable series of papers about the global dynamics of solutions to this system",
    ", he constructed a family of exact solutions parametrized by some reals @xmath0 and showed that these spacetimes do contain a naked singularity in certain range of @xmath1 , provided @xmath2 .",
    "later , in @xcite , he also established that these naked singularities are unstable under small perturbation .",
    "christodoulou s work provided the first complete mathematical proof of the formation of a naked singularity under gravitational collapse .    by construction , christoudoulou s spacetimes",
    "are homothetic , that is , _",
    "continuously self - similar _ and , therefore , do not contain any privileged scale ( such as a horizon of finite size ) , and so can not contain a ( finite ) black hole .",
    "consequently , these spacetimes are a  priori good candidates to contain naked singularities with a central point of infinite curvature , denoted by @xmath3 ; see @xcite .",
    "the critical solution found by choptuik also possesses self - similarity , but of a different type , known as _ discrete self - similarity .",
    "_ since the symmetries are different , christodoulou s solutions can not `` relax '' to the critical solution , and actually the relation between the two solutions is unclear a problem that would deserve further study .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 , whose origin is in the massless scalar field ( which only enters via its derivative in the einstein equations ) , is essential in christodoulou s construction , as well as the key restriction @xmath5 depending on the second parameter @xmath1 , an apparent horizon ( rather than a naked singularity ) is also possible in this range of @xmath4 . for @xmath6 the future light - cone of @xmath3 collapses to a line , which provides an example of a null singularity not preceded by an event horizon . for @xmath7",
    "the spacetimes are rather pathological ( see @xcite and the carter - penrose diagram in figure  4 of @xcite ) .    in all cases the parameter @xmath4 generates a mild loss of regularity at the center , which makes the curvature to be continuous but _ non - differentiable _ before the singularity at @xmath3",
    "is formed .",
    "this implies that the past light cone of @xmath3 is non - regular , hence the initial conditions are not completely regular .",
    "note that , on the contrary , choptuik s critical solution is smooth everywhere except at the central singularity at @xmath3 and , as a matter of fact , the sole requirements of regularity and discrete self - similarity select a unique solution , at least locally in the phase space ; see @xcite .",
    "if the massless scalar field is taken to be complex then it is possible to construct a continuously self - similar solution which shares the regularity properties of the choptuik spacetime , and also contains a naked singularity , but is not critical @xcite .",
    "our main objective in the present work is to investigate whether the relevance of @xmath4 and the role played by the limiting conditions on @xmath4 for the formation of naked singularities are `` structurally stable '' , that is , whether spacetimes with the same features can be constructed with extended models in which families of solutions with an equivalent parameter are present .",
    "indeed , the model we consider contains christodoulou s model as a special case .",
    "specifically , we work here within the scalar - tensor theory of gravitation and , especially , within the so - called brans - dicke theory .",
    "the model under consideration here effectively adds an additional scalar field to christodoulou s system of equations , and makes @xmath4 a _ dynamical variable _ , denoted by @xmath8 . interestingly enough , our analysis leads to the same range in order to avoid the pathological behavior referred to above , namely @xmath9 where now @xmath10 is the value of the field @xmath8 at the past light cone of the singularity .",
    "we also show that , starting from an arbitrary initial value for @xmath8 , the system under consideration dynamically evolves toward values @xmath8 _ below _ the threshold @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the introduction of extra degrees of freedom allows to avoid the pathological spacetimes arising with the einstein - scalar system .",
    "note that liebling and choptuik @xcite have numerically shown the presence of critical phenomena in the brans - dicke system , the critical solution being discretely or continuously self - similar ( depending a coupling constant ) .",
    "again , being completely smooth , such a critical solution is not related to the solutions we construct in this article . for further results ,",
    "see [ 5,18,20,26 ] .",
    "the system under study is significantly more involved than the one studied analytically by christodoulou @xcite and , although we do follow and generalize several important steps in the construction therein , we eventually must resort to numerical investigations to reach our final conclusions .",
    "in fact , by relying on numerics , we arrive at a better understanding of the class of solutions and are able to construct explicit examples .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ section2 ]",
    ", we introduce the model of self - gravitating matter of interest , and we determine the general evolution equations under the assumption of radial symmetry . in section  [ section3 ] , we impose the self - similar assumption and show that general solutions are parameterized by four functions of a single variable , denoted by @xmath12 , which obey a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) .",
    "we construct solutions that are piecewise regular , with each piece separated by singular points across which careful matching is required .",
    "specifically , in sections  [ section4 ] and  [ section5 ] , we successively construct the interior and exterior part of the past light - cone of the singularity .",
    "finally , in sections  [ section6 ] and [ section7 ] we describe our numerical strategy and present various results and conclusions .",
    "scalar - tensor theories of gravity are alternative theories of gravity which are physically strongly motivated and have a long history in the literature .",
    "the fundamental assumption of these theories is that the gravitational field is mediated by one ( or more ) scalar field(s ) in addition to the standard tensor field ( @xmath13 ) of einstein s general relativity .",
    "these theories satisfy the equivalence principle ( since they are metric - based theories ) , but do not satisfy the strong version of the equivalence principle .",
    "the first theory of this kind was developed by jordan  @xcite , fierz  @xcite , and brans and dicke  @xcite , and contains an additional parameter defining the coupling of the scalar field to the matter model .",
    "later on , bergmann  @xcite , nordtvedt  @xcite , and wagoner  @xcite extended this approach to a coupling via a function of the scalar field .",
    "next , damour and esposito - farse  @xcite introduced a generalization based on an arbitrary number of scalar fields .",
    "more recently , cosmological models based on the so - called @xmath14 gravity theories have attracted a lot of attention , which found applications in the study of relativistic stars  @xcite .",
    "these theories form a subclass of the scalar - tensor theories , and it is interesting to look for a better understanding of the corresponding spacetimes and , in particular as we do in the present work , to study the possible existence of spacetimes containing naked singularities .    specifically , we are going to investigate a generalization of christodoulou s model when a a scalar field @xmath15 in coupled to a scalar - tensor theory of gravity for which the action reads ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath16 we use a system of units for the gravitational constant @xmath17 and the light speed @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "the spacetime @xmath20 is four - dimensional and is endowed with two conformally - related metrics : the _ einstein metric _ denoted by @xmath13 , and the _ brans - dicke ( or physical ) metric _ denoted by @xmath21 in the latter , @xmath22 is a coupling function entering the theory , and one recovers classical general relativity by choosing @xmath23 to be constant .",
    "this theory admits two scalar fields : one of them , @xmath15 , represents the matter content of the spacetime and the other , @xmath24 , generates the gravitational field .",
    "when @xmath25 is not just a constant , the matter field @xmath15 does interact with the physical metric @xmath26 , whereas the gravitational field equations for @xmath27 are formulated in terms of @xmath13 , only .      throughout this paper",
    "we use a notation consistent with the one in christodoulou  @xcite , in order to make easier the comparison between the two models .",
    "we consider a general spherically symmetric spacetime whose metric is expressed in bondi coordinates  @xcite as @xmath28 in which the metric coefficients @xmath29 depend on the coordinates @xmath30 , only , and @xmath31 represents the unit round metric on the 2-sphere .",
    "the relevant components of the ricci tensor @xmath32 and @xmath33 are found to be ( see for instance  @xcite ) : @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "observe that these formulas involve first - order derivatives of the metric coefficients , only .",
    "for completeness , we also determine the other two non - vanishing components of the ricci tensor , which now involve second - order derivatives of the metric , i.e. @xmath36 note in passing the following simple relation : @xmath37    alternatively , one may consider the einstein tensor @xmath38 for the metric @xmath39 , and compute its essential components @xmath40      by varying the action of the theory with respect to both metrics , one gets two conformally - related stress - energy tensors @xmath41 and @xmath42 . denoting by @xmath43 and @xmath44 their traces , one can check that ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) : @xmath45 and @xmath46    following christodoulou @xcite , we use the future - directed null frame @xmath47 , defined by @xmath48 by contraction of the einstein equations ( [ e : einstein_g ] ) with @xmath49 , we obtain the following system : @xmath50 note that these equations involve only first - order derivatives of the metric and scalar fields .    on the other hand , by defining the function @xmath51 the evolution equation for the scalar field @xmath24 reads ( cf .  again @xcite )",
    "@xmath52 where @xmath53 is the wave operator associated with the einstein metric . in our gauge , this equation is equivalent to @xmath54    finally , the equation for the matter field @xmath15 is obtained from the zero - divergence law for the stress - energy tensor : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the covariant derivative associated with the physical metric . in terms of the einstein metric",
    ", the zero - divergence law for the stress - energy tensor reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the covariant derivative for the metric @xmath59 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to @xmath60 a linear equation for @xmath15 which , in our gauge , becomes @xmath61      for definiteness and simplicity , we study the case in which @xmath62 is a _ constant _ , which corresponds to brans - dicke theory  @xcite . integrating ( [ e : def_coupling ] ) we get @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a dimensionless constant ( independent of @xmath24 ) .",
    "assuming that it does not vanish , this constant can be eliminated by re - defining the matter field @xmath15 , and so we end up with @xmath65 which is the choice made in the rest of this paper .",
    "our equations can be easily compared with those used in other investigations of the brans - dicke theory .",
    "for instance , liebling and choptuik @xcite have ( denoting their variables with subindex lc ) @xmath66 which imply @xmath67 .",
    "( special care must be taken with the fact that , in @xcite , units with @xmath68 are used so that various factors like @xmath69 arise in their equations . )",
    "we now impose continuous self - similarity on the solutions , that is , @xmath70 for some ( conformal ) homothetic killing field denoted by @xmath71 . to work with self - similar solutions",
    ", it is convenient to use adapted coordinates , in which the integral lines of @xmath71 are now coordinate lines .",
    "every spherically symmetric and self - similar spacetime ( except minkowski ) has a singularity at a point on the central world - line , and we shall use it to define the origin of time , so that @xmath72 represents the future null cone of the singularity . moreover , since we are interested in the process of the formation of singularities , we ( principally ) work in the past region @xmath73 .    we define bondi s self - similar coordinates by @xmath74 where the sign in @xmath75 is chosen so that @xmath76 and @xmath75 increase simultaneously toward the future .",
    "the homothetic vector is now @xmath77 , with integral lines @xmath78const . , and points away from the singularity which is now located at @xmath79 .",
    "referring for instance @xcite for the general geometry of self - similar spacetimes , we note that in these coordinates the metric reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are functions of @xmath83 .",
    "the lie derivative @xmath84 is now simply @xmath85 and , consequently , the symmetry condition ( [ homothetic ] ) implies that all metric coefficients depend on @xmath12 , only , so @xmath86 this implies similar conditions on the scalar fields and , since @xmath24 arises in an undifferentiated form , the relevant condition is @xmath87 however , @xmath15 only enters the equations in differentiated form and hence the condition is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a function of @xmath12 , only , and @xmath4 is a dimensionless real constant .    * remark . * _ an interesting variant of the above symmetry assumption was adopted in @xcite , where self - similar , complex - valued , scalar field solutions are constructed from the ansatz @xmath90 , for some dimensionless real constant @xmath91 .",

    "we see a decrease of @xmath8 until _ values below @xmath11 _ are reached , and then we reach the singular point @xmath262 , where the integration is stopped .",
    "we have found this behavior in all tested cases , including cases with large values of the initial @xmath263 ( above 1000 , say ) .",
    "the value of @xmath264 does not alter the qualitative picture , though the decay of @xmath8 is faster for larger values of @xmath264 .",
    "interestingly enough , for large values of @xmath263 the final value @xmath10 is almost independent of that initial value . for sufficiently large values of @xmath264",
    "we find numerically that @xmath10 tends to @xmath265 .    in other words",
    ", we can have solutions in which the central singularity has a past light - cone for initial values of the constant @xmath4 for which christodoulou s corresponding solution would be more pathological , with that light - cone becoming actually a border of the spacetime .",
    "according to the previous section when @xmath216 , the solution of ( [ reduced ] ) converges to a singular point of the form @xmath266 , where @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 . to treat the solutions in the neighborhood of such singular point , and following @xcite",
    ", we introduce a new independent variable t satisfying @xmath270 which converts the singular point at finite @xmath271 into a critical point at @xmath272 .",
    "thus , by using ( [ reducedbeta ] ) , the variables @xmath273 and @xmath8 satisfy the system @xmath274 the singular point @xmath275 is an equilibrium point of the previous system , and the jacobian matrix at this point reads @xmath276    the spectrum of @xmath277 is given by @xmath278 the eigenvalue @xmath279 corresponds to the fact that the set @xmath280 defined by the equilibrium points of the form @xmath275 , with @xmath281 , is a ( one - dimensional ) curve .",
    "each point @xmath275 has an unstable manifold @xmath282 of dimension three , corresponding to the three other eigenvalues having a positive real part .",
    "naturally , @xmath282 must be transverse to @xmath283 .",
    "we also observe that all solutions originating at @xmath275 and extending from the interior to the exterior region , admit the following expansion ( when @xmath272 ) : @xmath284 where @xmath285 and @xmath286 are ( bounded ) periodic - rotating vector - valued functions , and @xmath287 a fixed eigenvector of the matrix @xmath288 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath289 .",
    "the three vectors @xmath287 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 are linearly independent for all @xmath290 .",
    "up to a translation in @xmath290 , we can assume that @xmath291 and , thus , we obtain a two - parameter family of solutions .",
    "the expansion above shows that the functions on the left - hand - side are _ continuous at the past light - cone , but not differentiable in @xmath271 _ there for @xmath292 , since they will generically contain terms of the form @xmath293 or @xmath294",
    ". in particular @xmath108 will be only continuous , and hence _ curvature will be discontinuous , _ though still finite , at the past light - cone .",
    "we computed in section [ ss : center ] the fixed points of our dynamical system . in the interior the relevant point was ( a ) , but now we will study ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "we first focus our study of the exterior region on an equilibrium point of the form ( b ) , namely @xmath295 the jacobian matrix of system ( [ reduced ] ) at this point is given by @xmath296 the spectrum of this matrix is given by @xmath297 which gives the asymptotic behavior @xmath298 the eigenvalue @xmath279 corresponds to the fact that the set @xmath299 defined by the equilibrium points of the form @xmath300 , is a ( one - dimensional ) curve .",
    "each point @xmath300 has a stable manifold @xmath301 of dimension three , corresponding to the three other eigenvalues having a negative real part .",
    "naturally , @xmath301 must be transverse to @xmath302 .",
    "consider now the two isolated critical points of form ( d ) @xmath303 the jacobian matrix of system ( [ reduced ] ) at @xmath304 reads @xmath305 the spectrum of the previous matrix is given by @xmath306 each point @xmath304 , @xmath307 has a stable manifold @xmath308 and an unstable manifold @xmath309 , both of dimension two .",
    "the points @xmath300 are _ attractors _ ( except for the marginal direction connecting them ) , and our numerical simulations below will show that it is indeed possible to _ evolve from points @xmath275 at the past light - cone to points @xmath300 at the future light - cone . _    in this section , in order to establish that this is indeed the future light - cone @xmath72 of the singularity , we investigate the behavior of exterior incoming null rays for solutions terminating at such point @xmath300 .",
    "the exterior condition means that we work with @xmath310 .",
    "evolving towards a fixed point means that we can approach @xmath128 , and hence this is either @xmath311 or @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we need to show that incoming null rays can reach @xmath128 at finite @xmath312 . in self - similar",
    "coordinates @xmath313 the equation of incoming null rays is @xmath314 and hence , for a given ray originating at @xmath315 , @xmath316 from ( [ expansionflc ] ) we get that @xmath317 for some constant @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , @xmath318 converges to a finite quantity as @xmath319 .",
    "finally , it remains to show that _ the future light - cone is not a curvature singularity , so that the spacetime can be continued beyond it .",
    "_ indeed , while the self - similar coordinate system @xmath83 becomes singular on the future light - cone , we still can take the limit @xmath320 in the formula ( [ ricciscalarb ] ) , replacing the results in ( [ expansionflc ] ) .",
    "the result for the ricci scalar @xmath170 of the spacetime metric is @xmath321 hence @xmath170 is _ finite everywhere on the future light - cone _ except of course at @xmath322 ( which is a curvature singularity ) .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for the gauss curvature of the two - dimensional reduced spacetime , or for the kretchmann scalars of the four - dimensional and two - dimensional metrics .",
    "our points @xmath323 play the same role as christodoulou s point @xmath324 , and we see that they are indeed closely related since the field @xmath102 vanishes at our points @xmath300 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a sign that the brans - dicke field is becoming _",
    "irrelevant on the future light - cone _ of the singularity and , therefore , that the spacetime has the same properties as the ones of christodoulou s solutions within a small neighborhood of the light - cone .",
    "an important difference between our construction and christodoulou s one is that he can construct time - symmetric solutions , since the data on the past and future light - cones coincide .",
    "but , such construction is not possible here precisely because the point @xmath275 has a non - vanishing field @xmath102 while the point @xmath300 has @xmath133 .",
    "christodoulou uses the above fact to `` copy '' the past region of the spacetime onto the future region ( cf .",
    "[ regions ] ) , finding a possible complete spacetime containing the naked singularity , with a center which is only mildly singular . in our case , to have a complete spacetime , we would need to evolve ( numerically ) further from data on the future light cone but we shall not do that here , as we decided focus on establishing the presence of the singularity , only .",
    "finally , the structure of phase space around this point is quite different in our system .",
    "there is no equivalent of christodoulou s points @xmath325 and @xmath326 , due to the general tendency of the variables @xmath108 and @xmath102 to _ `` rotate '' among them _",
    "( which is the same phenomenon as the one discussed in figure  [ streams ] ) .",
    "the two - dimensional funnel in christodoulou s pictures is converted here into a _ higher - dimensional _ analogue . in the following section we use numerical evolutions to demonstrate this behavior .",
    "we perform a numerical integration of the system   ( [ reduced ] ) using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "this is done in four steps :    1 .   using the coordinate @xmath327 , from @xmath123 , with @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath328 , and @xmath133",
    ", we integrate the equation ( [ 399 ] ) up to some finite value @xmath329 .",
    "2 .   then , switching to the reduced system ( [ reduced ] ) in the coordinate @xmath271 we use an adaptive - step approach to integrate on the interval @xmath330 and get as close as possible to @xmath172 , where @xmath331 .",
    "3 .   next ,",
    "starting again from @xmath332 , we integrate the system ( [ reduced ] ) _ backward _ to reach @xmath172 . at @xmath196",
    ", we have two new parameters , namely @xmath333 and @xmath334 , whereas @xmath335 and @xmath336 are determined so that all quantities @xmath337 match at @xmath338 .",
    "4 .   finally , from @xmath339",
    ", we integrate forward with a constant step - size and check whether the system ( [ reduced ] ) converges to a stationary point or diverges .    a first step is needed to start from the accurate values at the central singularity , as defined in section  [ ss : center ] ; the matching with the second step at @xmath340 is straightforward , since the transition is done at a point at which all quantities have regular behavior and we only make a change of coordinate from @xmath12 to @xmath271 .",
    "the matching at @xmath172 is much more complicated and we first explain now the technique used to recover the results by christodoulou  @xcite .      in his study , christodoulou solves the equivalent of our two first equations ( for @xmath341 and @xmath342 ) in the reduced system ( [ reduced ] ) : @xmath343 ( cf .  the equations @xmath344 and @xmath345 in @xcite . ) in a neighborhood of @xmath172 , for @xmath346 , christodoulou finds that the solution @xmath103 depends on a real parameter @xmath1 ( see  ( 2.13 ) and  ( 2.14 ) in  @xcite ) , but one always has @xmath347 on the other hand , the solution @xmath348 has the following behavior : @xmath349 with these information , we devise the numerical integration strategy as follows . given a value of @xmath4 , we integrate the system ( [ e : christo_alpha])([e : christo_theta ] ) until @xmath215 , and thus determine the approximate value of @xmath172 up to high accuracy .",
    "we then define @xmath350 with the sign chosen so as to @xmath332 and @xmath351 for numerical convenience .",
    "we then set @xmath352 with @xmath353 a new parameter than can be freely chosen and is to represent the degree of freedom , induced by the parameter @xmath1 of christodoulou s study ( see section  2 and eqs .",
    "( 2.13b)-(2.14c ) of @xcite ) . from the two points @xmath354",
    ", we integrate backward toward @xmath172 and @xmath355 .",
    "when doing so , we find numerically that , in most cases , @xmath114 is diverging at some value @xmath356 .",
    "this is due to the approximate value of @xmath357 in ( [ e : def_beta1_theta1 ] ) that was chosen to initiate the integration .",
    "since we are dealing with an autonomous system , we can perform a slight shift @xmath358 in the variable @xmath271 , so that @xmath359 .    in figure",
    "[ f : christo ] are shown the numerical solutions of the differential system ( [ e : christo_alpha]([e : christo_theta ] ) , for @xmath360 and with two different values of @xmath361 .",
    "we have numerically observed that , if the parameter @xmath362 was small enough and for any value of @xmath353 , the backward integration detailed here - above would always bring back to the solution @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "we were thus able to numerically recover the result by christodoulou  @xcite that , for a given @xmath365 , each solution of the system ( [ e : christo_alpha])([e : christo_theta ] ) connects to a one - parameter family of solutions at @xmath338 .    by varying the parameter @xmath353",
    ", one can reach different asymptotic regimes , when @xmath366 : both fields @xmath114 and @xmath103 can diverge or they can converge to the stationary point @xmath367 .",
    "this last case is displayed in figure  [ f : alpha_christo ] , with the trajectories of the solutions in the @xmath368 plane .",
    "( this is to be compared with figure  4 in  @xcite . )      in the case of interest in this paper , we have to deal with the matching of four fields @xmath369 at @xmath338 .",
    "we use the same numerical technique , with the four steps described at the beginning of this section . we have numerically observed that here , in addition to @xmath353(@xmath370 ) , we need to specify the value of @xmath334 . on the other hand , near an equilibrium point @xmath275 , with @xmath281 we get from the first and last equations in ( [ reducedbeta ] ) : @xmath371 so that we can write the following expansions : @xmath372 we can therefore obtain numerical estimations of the values of these two fields at @xmath339 and perform the integration backward , from @xmath196 toward @xmath172 .",
    "we again do the shift in @xmath271 to match @xmath93 up to machine precision at @xmath338 , but doing so does not allow for an accurate matching of @xmath373 .",
    "we then do several ( usually no more than five ) integrations from @xmath196 toward @xmath172 , correcting each time the starting value @xmath336 in such a way that , at the end , the function @xmath373 is continuous at @xmath172 , up to machine precision .",
    "results are displayed in figure  [ f : resu_tss ] , where we have taken @xmath360 and @xmath374 .",
    "the matching of all four fields are done with the setting of two new parameters @xmath375 , which seems to indicate that a solution starting from the interior region ( @xmath203 ) connects to a two - parameter family of solutions in the exterior region ( @xmath346 ) . depending on these two parameters @xmath375",
    ", we numerically recover a behavior similar to that of christodoulou s system  @xcite : for some values of @xmath376 and @xmath377 , the system can converge to the stationary point ( b ) of section  [ ss : center ] , that is , @xmath378 with @xmath379    part of this behavior is displayed in figure  [ f : alpha_tss ] , where the trajectories in the @xmath380 space , for three sets of parameters @xmath381 .",
    "each set of parameters can lead _ a priori _ to a different limit @xmath300 .",
    "if these trajectories were projected onto the @xmath382 plane , they would resemble a lot the ones of the general - relativistic system of figure  [ f : alpha_christo ] , studied by christodoulou  @xcite , with the noticeable difference that we no longer have a single limit @xmath383 , but the endpoint depends in general on the value @xmath384 ( see  ( [ e : klim ] ) ) , which changes from one set of parameters to another .",
    "we have studied the formation of naked singularities in the process of the gravitational collapse of a real massless scalar field , and have generalized christodoulou s construction of a family of spacetimes containing a naked singularity .",
    "while christodoulou worked within the classical einstein theory , we have here considered the brans - dicke theory .",
    "this effectively led us to deal with a new scalar field and to promote christodoulou s constant parameter @xmath4 to a dynamical variable @xmath8 .",
    "we were able to fully analyze the interior region and rigorously justify the matching across the past light - cone of the naked singularity .",
    "partial analytical information was also obtained in the exterior region , and we finally completed our study with numerical simulations .",
    "we could show that the variable @xmath8 always decreases from any initial value to a value @xmath10 smaller than @xmath11 at the past light - cone .",
    "this eliminates the possibility in christodoulou s work of forming pathological solutions without a past light - cone . in that sense",
    "the addition of the brans - dicke field has a `` regularizing '' effect .",
    "the behavior of the solutions in the exterior region is similar to the one of christodoulou s solution and , in fact , the brans - dicke field vanishes on the future light - cone of the singularity ( a cauchy horizon ) .",
    "however , the dynamical structure of the phase space is quite different , as our phase space is much larger and does not contain christodoulou s case as a subspace .    like christodoulou established for solutions to the classical einstein equations , our solutions are probably highly unstable against small ( radially symmetric , for instance ) perturbations .",
    "it is quite reasonable to expect that more general scalar - tensor theories would exhibit a similar behavior . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to extend our conclusions to the more general models arising in the so - called @xmath14 theories of gravity when the action involves a nonlinear function of the ricci scalar .",
