    "pks  1921293 ( ov236 ) is identified with a 17.5 v - magnitude quasar . at a redshift of 0.352 ( wills & wills 1981 )",
    ", pks1921@xmath2293 is one of the closest members of its class .",
    "an angular resolution of 1  mas corresponds to a linear resolution of 4.6  pc ( assuming h@xmath3  =  65  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath3  =  0.5 ) .",
    "pks  1921293 is one of the strongest and most compact extragalactic radio sources known , which makes it a prime candidate for high - resolution vlbi observations .",
    "pks  1921293 , together with 3c273b and 3c279 , is currently among the brightest extragalactic sources in the sky at millimeter wavelengths , having a flux density at 3 mm greater than 5jy since 1990 with a peak of 15.3jy in april 1994 ( tornikoski et al .",
    "its compactness , implied by its flat radio spectrum , has been confirmed by space vlbi ( vsop ) observations ( shen et al .",
    "1999 ) . on projected space - ground baselines of 25,000 km ( about three times longer than the longest ground baselines ) ,",
    "pks  1921293 had a correlated flux density of 1.0jy ( 1.6ghz ) , and a derived core brightness temperature limit of 3.0@xmath5k ( in the rest frame of the quasar ) .",
    "the new observations of pks1921293 were made with the nrao vlba at four frequencies ( 5 , 12 , 15 , and 43ghz ) over a period of six years from 1994 to 2000 .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , new mexico , usa .",
    "standard vlbi data calibrations and corrections for residual delays and rates were done in aips . at 43ghz ,",
    "the atmospheric opacity correction was also performed in addition to a priori amplitude calibration .",
    "the final image processing was carried out using aips and difmap .    in general , the source morphologies obtained at various centimeter wavelengths ( i.e. , 5 , 12 and 15ghz ) are very similar and consistent with the past observations .",
    "however , their overall structural orientation shows a significant difference from that observed at 43ghz .",
    "figure1 shows two images observed simultaneously at 5 and 43ghz in september 2000 . at centimeter wavelengths",
    "all of the vlba images are characterized by a diffuse emission region ( cm - jet ) extended about 10mas along a position angle ( p.a . ) of 30@xmath0 as well as a very compact , bright core at the center . at 43ghz ,",
    "our six - epoch vlba images reveal an even more compact core emission region plus the jet emission ( mm - jet ) .",
    "the mm - jet has a varying p.a . with time , but is oriented toward the north - west .",
    "the core brightness temperature derived from 43ghz images has a lower limit between 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7k .",
    "one of the important results of the analysis of the multi - epoch , multi - frequency vlba images of pks1921293 is its strongly curved jet emission . the difference in p.a . between the cm - jet and the mm - jet",
    "is at least 51@xmath067@xmath0 , as determined by the simultaneous two - frequency ( 5 and 43ghz ) observations made both in february 1996 and in september 2000 ( see figure1 ) .",
    "such a large bending is not unexpected for a jet that is beamed close to the observer s line of sight , for which small changes in angle can be amplified by projection effects .",
    "the 43ghz vlba observations of the mm - jet and its motions ( see section 4 below ) suggest a curved trajectory within the central few parsecs , while the trajectory of the cm - jet appears to be constant at larger core separations ( seen at lower frequencies ) .",
    "figure2 is a schematic diagram showing a single smoothly bent path connecting the mm - jet and the cm - jet through an inner jet component detected by the vsop observations ( shen et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that whether the curvature in the jet emission is responsible for the non - detection of the @xmath1ray emission by the egret ( fichtel et al .",
    "1994 ) is not clear , as some larger bending angles have also been seen in other @xmath1ray bright sources ( britzen et al .",
    "for the large scale cm - jet emission , we obtained the proper motion from the position of the brightest component at 5ghz that has a mean p.a . of 28@xmath0@xmath82@xmath0 .",
    "the fitted proper motion over the past 7.5 years is 0.15@xmath80.08masyr@xmath4 , corresponding to a superluminal velocity of 3.0@xmath81.6c . the proper motion ( apparent superluminal velocity ) within the mm - jet is estimated to be 0.16@xmath80.01masyr@xmath9 ( 3.2@xmath80.2c ) , along a position angle of 28@xmath0@xmath83@xmath0 with regard to a reference position at epoch 1994.32 of 0.54mas and p.a.=@xmath10 ( from the origin ) . the p.a .",
    "of the cm - jet emission region relative to this reference mm - jet component is about 34@xmath0@xmath83@xmath0 .",
    "note that the error bars are derived from the statistical uncertainties only .",
    "therefore , the jet components in pks1921293 seem to move along a straight path from about 2.5pc to about 25pc ( as depicted in figure2 ) . the p.a . of the reference mm - jet emission",
    "is roughly perpendicular to the derived direction of its superluminal motion .",
    "this may further suggest that the jet emission observed so far is part of a curved trajectory that undergoes a sharply bending ( @xmath11pa@xmath1290@xmath0 ) phase within the central 2pc region .",
    "an important question is how the jet moves in the innermost region of the central engine where the relativistic plasma is accelerated and collimated .",
    "our six epoch 7 mm vlba observations found consistently that the central parsec region ( @xmath14 1pc ) consists of two equally compact components ( labelled as c1 and c2 in figure1 ) .",
    "the fitted sizes for both c1 and c2 are 0.1mas or less .",
    "away from the central parsec region , the jet emission gradually decreased in flux density as it was moving away .",
    "the scenario in the central 1pc region , however , is quite different .",
    "the flux density of component c1 appears not to change , compared to the rapid variation in the total flux densities observed at 90 and 230ghz by sest ( tornikoski 2001 , private communication ) . on the other hand ,",
    "component c2 undergoes a significant ( @xmath15200% ) variation in flux density which seems to correlate with the total flux density variation .",
    "the dramatic variability seen in component c2 may argue that c2 is related to the central activity , though the observed superluminal motion suggests that the component c1 , at the eastern end , is the location of the core .    over about 6.5 yrs of six epoch 43ghz vlba observations ,",
    "the relative position between c1 and c2 of 0.2mas ( i.e. , @xmath14 1pc ) along a p.a . of @xmath250@xmath0 remains unchanged within an uncertainty of 0.05mas .",
    "high resolution vsop observations at 5ghz have also suggested the existence of such a compact double structure , but with a larger separation of @xmath150.4mas at a similar p.a .",
    "( shen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the difference in the separation may be due to the opacity effects , i.e. , the frequency - dependent shift of the synchrotron self - absorbed core at longer wavelength .",
    "pks1921293 becomes optically thick at centimeter wavelengths    some possible explanations are : 1 ) c2 is just a stationary knot that is located at the turning point of the bent path and its emission is amplified by relativistic beaming ; 2 ) c2 is a trailing shock following the steady , fast superluminal motion at the front as seen in the radio galaxy 3c120 ( gmez et al .",
    "2001 ) ; 3 ) this may infer the existence of a binary system within the central parsec region of pks1921293 , which could be associated with a massive black hole binary . a supermassive binary in an agn will result in the precession of the jet ejection axis , which may explain the observed large bend ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ) . new high - resolution vlbi imaging observations at both 86 and 43ghz are underway to investigate the binary hypothesis as well as the above - mentioned possibilities .",
