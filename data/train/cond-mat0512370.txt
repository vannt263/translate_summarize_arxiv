    "following the early pioneering study@xcite on vertical electron transport in superlattices ( sls ) , one of the recent surprising discoveries is self - sustained current oscillations ( sscos ) under a dc bias@xcite .",
    "a large number of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on different aspects of these oscillations .",
    "experimentally , it is known that sscos can be induced by varying the doping density@xcite , temperature and magnetic field@xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is understood that sscos are accompanied by the motion of boundaries of electric field domains ( efds)@xcite . a discrete drift ( dd ) model capable of describing both the formation of stationary efds and sscos emerged after many tedious analysises and numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "our understanding of sscos was greatly advanced through numerical investigations of this model@xcite . however",
    ", this nonlinear dynamical model is too difficult to be solved analytically in a way that one can understand its different types of attractor solutions and their bifurcations .",
    "thus , a minimum model with certain solvability may give some help for understanding these phenomena .",
    "recently wang and niu(wn)@xcite proposed a simple model with many nice features .",
    "this model is capable of revealing analytically the source of instabilities in the electron transport .",
    "however , we can show that this model always has at least one stable steady - state solution ( sss ) under a dc bias .",
    "thus it does not support a ssco , and it can not be a minimum model for the ssco phenomenon .",
    "the question that we want to address is whether it is possible to find a minimum model which is simpler than the dd model .",
    "we shall show that a generalized wn model , by including the negative differential capacitance , may have no stable sss , thus it can be a possible minimum toy model for ssco in superlattices .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec.[wn ] , we shall show that there is always a stable sss in the original wn s model no matter what kind of @xmath0 curve is used for each barrier .",
    "then we will derive a generalized wn model by including negative differential capacitance in sec.[gwn ] . in sec.[ndc ] , we shall show that this toy model with both negative differential capacitance and ndr can include both @xmath0 oscillations of stable ssss and ssco behaviors if the model parameters are properly selected .",
    "let us first briefly review wn s model .",
    "wn employed the following three assumptions for their model of a superlattice of n quantum wells .",
    "( 1 ) inside each quantum well , the electronic states are described fully by time - independent quantum mechanics .",
    "( 2 ) charge carriers are in local equilibrium with each well so that a chemical potential can be defined locally .",
    "the chemical potential difference between two adjacent wells is call the bias v between them .",
    "( 3 ) for a given bias v between two adjacent wells , a current i(v ) passes through the barrier between them . in the following ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the electric current and bias through the @xmath3th barrier , @xmath4 the _ free _ charge in the @xmath3th well .",
    "the current @xmath1 is supposed to depend on the bias @xmath2 only .",
    "wn thus obtain the following dynamical equations @xmath5",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8        -0.8 cm    -0.8 cm    eq.([wn01 ] ) and eq.([wn02 ] ) are the charge conservation law and the poisson equation for the @xmath9 well , while eq.([wn03 ] ) is the constraint condition that the total bias should be constant . as a first step ,",
    "let us consider a simple case that i - v curves of all barriers are the same , as shown in fig.[i_v1 ] .",
    "denote @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the maximum and minimum currents and the corresponding biases in the i - v curve as shown in fig.[i_v1 ] .",
    "an sss of eq.([wn01])([wn03 ] ) @xmath12 should satisfy @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the equilibrium current of the sss .",
    "wn have proven the following conclusion@xcite .",
    "* lemma 1 . * * ( a ) * an sss is stable if all barriers at the sss are in their pdr regions , i.e. , @xmath15 * ( b ) * if one and only one barrier of an sss is in its ndr region , then the sss is stable if and only if @xmath16^{-1}>0 ;     \\label{wn05}\\ ] ] * ( c ) * if two and more barriers are in their ndr regions , then the sss is unstable .    with the use of * lemma 1 *",
    ", we can prove    * claim 1 .",
    "* for eq.([wn01])([wn03 ] ) , there is at least one stable sss for each value of @xmath17 when all @xmath0 curves are the same and has only one ndr region",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* when @xmath18 $ ] or @xmath19 , an sss with @xmath20 for all barriers is stable according to * lemma 1(a ) * since @xmath21 drops in either lower - bias pdr region @xmath22 or upper - bias pdr region @xmath23 .",
    "thus our proof can be restricted to the region of @xmath24 , and all we need to do is to find a stable sss for each value of @xmath24 .",
    "let us start by considering an sss with the first barrier in its ndr region and all other barriers in their lower - bias pdr regions as shown in fig.[i_v1 ] .",
    "the equilibrium current @xmath14 of this sss is slightly smaller than @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 is a negative infinitely small value .",

    "now let us look for a stable sss in the case when the total bias @xmath33 .",
    "if the above sss itself is stable , then it can be the sss we look for .",
    "on the contrary , if the above sss is unstable , then by eq.([claim05 ] ) we have @xmath34 which means that @xmath35 is in the region @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "thus there is also a stable sss in this case since we have shown that there is always one stable sss when @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "therefore , there is always a stable sss when the total bias @xmath37 , regardless of whether the above sss is stable or not .",
    "since @xmath38 is regarded as infinitely small , by eq.([claim03 ] ) the value @xmath39 is also infinitely small .",
    "thus we can say that we have proven the existence of a stable sss when @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "now let us further decrease @xmath14 by @xmath38 and consider the corresponding sss of the total bias @xmath41 with only the first barrier in the ndr region .",
    "similar to eqs.([claim01])([claim05 ] ) , we can obtain that this sss in unstable when and only when @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we can prove the existence of a stable sss when @xmath43 $ ] . by decreasing @xmath14 step by step",
    ", we can go on with this procedure before @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath44 , the sss we consider is as follows : the bias of the first barrier is @xmath45 and the biases of all other barriers are @xmath46 .",
    "thus we have proven the existence of a stable sss for @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "then , let us consider the following series of ssss and increase the equilibrium current @xmath14 from @xmath48 to @xmath25 : the first barrier in a part of its upper pdr region , i.e. , @xmath49 and all other barriers in a part of their lower pdr regions , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "it is obvious that this series of ssss are stable because all barriers are in pdr regions .",

    "the first barrier is in its upper - bias pdr region while all other barriers are at the cross point between the lower - bias pdr region and the ndr region . to go further",

    "suppose that for some @xmath58 we have proven the conclusion that there is always a stable sss for @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "then , in order to extend the conclusion to a larger region @xmath60 $ ] with @xmath61 , all we need to do is to find a series of ssss that fulfill the following two conditions : ( 1 ) the maximum number of barriers in ndr regions for each sss is one ; ( 2 ) the total bias of the series of ssss covers the region between @xmath62 and @xmath63 . using this method , we can extend the conclusion of * claim 1 * to a general case and obtain    * claim 2 . * for eq.([wn01])([wn03 ] ) , there is alway one stable sss for each value of @xmath17 when @xmath0 curves of barriers are not necessarily the same while each barrier has only one ndr region .",
    "* proof . *",
    "since @xmath0 curves of barriers are not necessarily the same , let us denote @xmath64 and @xmath65 as the maximum and minimum currents and the corresponding biases in the i - v curve of the @xmath3th barrier .",
    "without loss of generality , let us suppose that @xmath66 as shown in fig.[i_v2 ] .",
    "let us start by considering a series of ssss with the first barrier lying between the origin and @xmath67 while all other barriers lying in their low - bias pdr regions .",
    "let us increase the equilibrium current of these ssss @xmath14 continuously from zero to @xmath68 .",
    "this series of ssss are stable because all barriers are in pdr regions .",
    "now we arrive at an sss with the first barrier at @xmath67 while all other barriers in their low - bias pdr regions .",
    "let us denote the total bias of this sss as @xmath62 .",
    "then , we have proven that there is always a stable sss for @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the rest task of the proof is to find a series of ssss that fulfill : ( 1 ) the maximum number of barriers in ndr regions for each sss is one ; ( 2 ) the total bias of the series of ssss covers the region @xmath69 . following the method in * claim 1",
    "* , let us decrease @xmath14 from @xmath68 to @xmath70 and consider a series of ssss with the first barrier lying between @xmath67 and @xmath71 and the second lying between @xmath72 and @xmath73 while all other barriers lying in their low - bias pdr regions .",
    "then we arrive at an sss with the first barrier at @xmath71 and the second barrier at @xmath73 while all other barriers lying in their low - bias pdr regions .",
    "let us denote the total bias of this sss as @xmath63 .",
    "thus we have proven that there is always a stable sss for @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "then , keep the first barrier in its high - bias pdr region , let @xmath14 increase , and move the second barrier along the trace @xmath74 and other barriers correspondingly . if @xmath75 , then the second barrier can cross @xmath76 when the first barrier is still in its high - bias pdr region .",
    "if @xmath77 , then the second barrier reaches @xmath78 when the first barrier reaches @xmath71 . at this point , the second barrier can not move continuously from @xmath78 to @xmath79 with the above method applicable . in order to fill the sudden jump from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ,",
    "we can do as follows : move the first barrier from @xmath71 to @xmath80 while all other barriers are unmoved .",
    "this decreases the total bias . according to the above proof",

    "then , we can first move the second barrier from @xmath78 to @xmath79 while keep all other barriers in their low - bias pdr regions , then move the first barrier along @xmath81 while keep the second barrier in its high - bias pdr region and other barriers in their low - bias pdr regions . by doing this",
    ", we let the second barrier cross its minimum current point while keeps the number of ndr barriers in this series of ssss less than or equal to one .",
    "now let us consider the third barrier .",
    "if @xmath82 is larger than @xmath70 and @xmath83 , then it is easy to let the third barrier cross its minimum current point .",
    "if @xmath82 is less than one of @xmath70 and @xmath83 , say,@xmath84 while @xmath85 as shown in fig.[i_v2 ] , then we can use the method in the proceeding paragraph to let the third barrier cross its minimum current point .",

    "when the third barrier reaches @xmath86 , move the first barrier from @xmath71 to @xmath80 . then , move the second barrier from @xmath76 to @xmath87 when the third barrier reaches @xmath88 .",
    "after that , let the third barrier cross its minimum current point while keeping all other barriers in their low - bias pdr regions .",

    "when this is finished , let the second barrier cross its minimum barrier with the use of the above method .",
    "thus the first , second and third barriers cross their minimum current point .",
    "keep this go on , we can cross the ndr regions of all n barriers .",
    "this finishes the proof because the conclusion is obvious when all ndr regions are crossed . * qed*.    in the above proof , we restrict to the case that there is only one ndr region in @xmath0 curve of each barrier .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the above proof for general @xmath0 curves that may have a lot of ndr regions separated by pdr regions .",
    "in fact , one can show that the above method works if the following condition is fulfilled : each barrier always lies in pdr region when the absolute value of its bias is above some upper - limit value .",
    "this condition is generally fulfilled .",
    "therefore , we can come to the conclusion that there is always a stable sss in wn s original model no matter what kind of @xmath0 curve is used for each barrier .",
    "in this section , we shall derive a generalized wn model and introduce negative differential capacitance . in the generalized model",
    ", we consider each barrier as a narrow homogeneous dielectric material .",
    "then , instead of using the poisson equation , we make use of the gauss law for dielectric materials @xmath89s=4\\pi n_{i}(t )      \\label{gwn01}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 the electric displacement in the @xmath3th barrier and @xmath91 the transverse area of the superlattice .",
    "we assume that @xmath90 only depends on the average electric field @xmath92 , @xmath93 the thickness of the @xmath3th barrier . eq.([wn01 ] ) still holds since it is the charge conservation law .",
    "eliminate @xmath4 by eq.([wn01 ] ) and eq.([gwn01 ] ) , we have @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 one can see that @xmath97 serves as the differential capacitance of the @xmath3th barrier because @xmath98 can be viewed as the differential dielectric function of it . when the conventional relation @xmath99 is substituted into eq.([gwn04 ] ) , one returns to wn s original model .",
    "thus the above model is a generalized version of wn s model with bias - dependent differential capacitance @xmath97 .",
    "take a sss of eq.([gwn02 ] ) and ( [ gwn03 ] ) @xmath12 which should satisfy @xmath100 and-0.8 cm @xmath101 follow the standard analysis of linear stability analysis as wn did@xcite , we take a time - dependent perturbation of the following form @xmath102 substitute it into eq.([gwn02 ] ) and ( [ gwn03 ] ) and take the linear terms of @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the differential capacitance and differential conductance of the @xmath3th barrier at @xmath106 .",
    "the solution of eq.([sa01 ] ) has the following form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a non - zero constant .",
    "substitute it back into eq.([sa01 ] ) , we find that a non - zero solution should satisfy @xmath109 the sss is stable if and only if none of @xmath110 satisfying eq.([sa01 ] ) is positive .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss the effect of differential capacitance on stability of the ssss .",
    "we shall first consider the case when all the differential capacitances are positive , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "as shown in eq.([sa02 ] ) in sec.[gwn ] , an sss is stable if and only if none of @xmath110 satisfying @xmath112 is positive . in the case when @xmath111 for all barriers , let us denote @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "wn found a method to analyze the root of @xmath115@xcite , and it is easy to show that their method works when all @xmath116 s have the same sign . following wn s method@xcite we obtain : ( 1 ) @xmath115 has no negative root when @xmath117 for all barriers ; ( 2 ) when @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath115 has one negative root if and only if @xmath120 . since @xmath121 for all barriers ,",
    "the above conclusions lead to the same conclusions mentioned in sec.[wn ] : ( 1 ) an sss is stable if all barriers have pdr , i.e. , @xmath122 ; ( 2 ) if one and only one barrier has ndr , then the sss is stable when @xmath123^{-1 }     = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}[i^{\\prime}(v_{i}^{0})]^{-1}>0 . \\label{edc01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the same proof as in sec.[wn ] leads us to the conclusion that in the generalized wn model of eq.([gwn02 ] ) and ( [ gwn03 ] ) there is always a stable sss in the absence of negative differential capacitance .     and @xmath124 vs. @xmath125 for two special cases which can lead to ssco . ( a ) barriers with negative differential capacitance and with no ndr region ; ( b ) barriers with two bias regions of negative differential capacitance and with an ndr region in between.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "now let us see what can happen when negative differential capacitance is introduced .",
    "it should be noted that since at present we can not have a reasonable way to expect _ negative _ differential capacitance in the original superlattice system , the model in this case can only be considered as a toy model .",
    "however , this toy model may be a minimum model for the phenomenon of self - sustained current oscillation .",
    "we shall show by a simple example that negative differential capacitance can lead to a non - stationary state .",
    "suppose that all barriers have the same @xmath0 curves with no ndr region , i.e. , @xmath126 , while @xmath127 curves are different and have a region of negative differential capacitance as shown in fig.[id_v](a ) .",
    "it is obvious that in this case the system has only one sss at @xmath128 .",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath128 drops into the negative differential capacitance region of every barrier , i.e. , @xmath129 for all barriers . then",
    ", with wn s method it is easy to check that this sss is unstable if two of @xmath130 are not equal .",
    "thus the system has no stable sss and must be in an ssco state .",
    "this means that the generalized model with negative differential capacitance and without ndr can lead to an ssco state .",
    "however , the model with only negative differential capacitance is not enough because the @xmath0 oscillation behavior of stable ssss observed in experiments can only be included by ndr .",
    "the ssco behaviors can also occur when both negative differential capacitance and ndr exist in the model .",
    "for example , consider the case shown in fig.[id_v](b ) where each barrier has one ndr region between two negative differential capacitance regions . in this case , the number of ssss is more than one .",
    "one can show that all ssss are unstable when the average @xmath131 drops in the region of both pdr and negative differential capacitance .",
    "therefore , the generalized wn model with both ndr and negative differential capacitance may be considered as a possible minimum toy model for self - sustained current oscillation .    in a recent study , sanchez et .",
    "al.@xcite have pointed out that wn s original model will always tend to a stable stationary state if it exists . however , their argument seems not fit for our generalized model with negative differential capacitance .",
    "following their argument , the total current of each barrier in our model is @xmath132 which leads to a series of equations for @xmath133 @xmath134^{-1}[i_{total}-i_{i}(v_{i } ) ] .",
    "\\label{new00}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] put them into @xmath135 we have @xmath136^{-1}i_{i}(v_{i})}{\\sum_{i}[c_{i}(v_{i})]^{-1}}.      \\label{new01}\\ ] ] put it back into eq.([new00 ] ) , we have the equations for @xmath133 @xmath137^{-1}}\\sum_{j}\\frac{i_i(v_i)-i_j(v_j)}{c_j(v_j)}.      \\label{new02}\\ ] ] unlike the case in the appendix of sanchez et .",
    "al.@xcite , in the presence of negative differential capacitance @xmath138 , the total current @xmath139 in eq.([new01 ] ) can be time - dependent and the equations of @xmath133 s in eqs.([new02 ] ) are coupled together through the factor @xmath140^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus the existence of limit circles and other types of ssco behaviors is possible in this toy model .",
    "although no parameter in this toy model represents directly for some external parameters in the original sl system such as well doping , temperature and transverse magnetic field , the presence of negative differential capacitance and ndr may be viewed as the consequence of selecting appropriate values of these external parameters in the original sl system .",
    "possible detailed relation between this toy model and the original sl system needs further study and is not the aim of this paper .    in summary",
    ", our analysis shows that a generalized wn s model without negative differential capacitance always has a stable sss and thus can not have ssco behaviors .",
    "this means that negative differential capacitance is necessary for the existence of ssco behavior .",
    "we show by a simple example that the same model with negative differential capacitance can have ssco behavior . however , the model with only negative differential capacitance is not enough , since ndr is necessary for the @xmath0 oscillation behavior of stable ssss observed in experiments@xcite .",
    "this means that the generalized wn model with both negative differential capacitance and ndr can serve as a possible minimum toy model for the phenomena of both self - sustained current oscillation and @xmath0 oscillation behavior of stable ssss .",
