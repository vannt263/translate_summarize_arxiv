    "for the light quarks , we use the chirally improved dirac operator , constructed via an expansion in gauge paths and the corresponding approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson relation ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as sources for the light - quark propagators , we use 12 ( 3 colors @xmath0 4 spins ) uniform walls , setting the color and spin of the quarks to be the same at all spatial positions and relying upon the random gauges of the ensemble of configurations to cancel any non - gauge - invariant ( open ) contributions to hadron correlators constructed from these quark propagators .",
    "this is similar to the volume source used by others @xcite for disconnected correlators , except for the fact that our source sits on only a single time - slice .",
    "connected meson correlators from two of these quarks should exhibit a signal arising from @xmath1 closed ( or gauge - invariant ) correlators , along with some additional noise from the @xmath2 open correlators .",
    "these sources have been used before for heavy quarkonium correlators with some success @xcite since the signal - to - noise ratio proved to be surprisingly good .",
    "since we retain our light - quark propagators and the heavy - quark evolution is computationally cheap , we are free to use a number of different gauge paths to create `` walls '' of extended heavy - light meson sources from the light - quark source before we compute the heavy - quark propagators . in this way we can construct a full matrix of correlators with various spatial extents and a collection of starting positions without additional light - quark inversions .",
    "the heavy - quark propagators are created using lowest - order nrqcd , along with some improvements for the lattice version @xcite .",
    "a single time - step of heavy - quark evolution is achieved via [ hqe ] g_q(x , 0 | y , t+a ) = 1 - ^n_t+a u^_4(y,t ) 1 - ^n_t g_q(x , 0 | y , t ) , where we use @xmath3 ( this is sufficient for @xmath4 quarks on our lattices ) and the hamiltonian is the @xmath5-improved , covariant , kinetic - energy operator , corrected to remove @xmath6 artifacts in the time evolution : h_0 = - - . since we include only the kinetic - energy term in our nrqcd expansion , there is no coupling of the heavy quark s color and spin , the latter being provided simply by the projection g_;q^ab(x , 0 | y , t ) = ( 1 + _ 4 ) _",
    "g_q^ab(x , 0 | y , t ) .",
    "the gauge paths and corresponding spin structures we use to create our mesons can be found in refs .  @xcite . through sums ( @xmath7 ) and differences ( @xmath8 ) of paths in opposite directions , along with different dirac matrices , meson operators with different symmetries can be constructed : e.g. , [ meson_s ] s : q(x ) u_p(x|x ) q(x ) = q _ 5 _ i s_i q ; p_- : q _ i _ i p_i q ; p_+ : q _ 1 p_1 - _ 2 p_2 q ; [ meson_d ] d _ : q _ 5 s_1 - s_2 q .",
    "thus far , we have only included straight paths , limiting us to s- , p- and d - wave mesons .",
    "also , since we do nt include heavy - quark spin interactions , a number of physical states are not separable : the s - wave operator , @xmath9 , must be viewed as creating a spin - average of @xmath10 and @xmath11 states ; the @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; the @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; and the @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "given all the ingredients , we now present the form of our heavy - light correlators : c_ij(t ) & & = _ x , x,y _",
    "u_p^da(x|x  ) _ i g_;q^ab(x,0|y , t ) . & & .",
    "* _ u_p^*bc(y|y ) _ j g_;q^cd(y,t|x,0 ) . note the sum over both quark source positions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , due to the use of the walls ; only the closed terms ( where @xmath20 ) will contribute to the signal .",
    "we include both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 correlators from opposite time directions .    after calculating the matrix of correlators , @xmath23 , between our linearly independent meson operators , @xmath24 ,",
    "we solve the corresponding generalized eigenvalue problem to extract the physical states @xcite : _ j",
    "c_ij(t ) _ j^k = ^k(t ,",
    "t_0 ) _ j c_ij(t_0 ) _",
    "j^k , where , for large enough values of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , ^k(t , t_0 ) = e^-m_k ( t - t_0 ) .",
    "so the eigenvalues provide the masses of the states and the eigenvectors reveal the meson wavefunctions dependencies upon the @xmath21 separation , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 along the principal axes ) .",
    "this technique of using operators with different spatial extents has also been recently used to determine excited states of baryons @xcite .",
    "in this section we present results from one set ( 100 ) of @xmath29 quenched configurations which were created using the lscher - weisz action at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 mev ) .    in fig .",
    "[ effmass ] we plot the effective masses calculated from the largest eigenvalues of each set of operators .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the @xmath34 masses resulting from correlated fits to the data over the corresponding time ranges .",
    "we repeat this for 6 mass combinations ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) in order to interpolate to the physical values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and to extrapolate to @xmath39 .",
    "the physical strange quark mass is determined via light - light meson spectroscopy ( @xmath40 @xmath32 @xmath41 ) ; the bottom quark mass is determined via finite - momentum heavy - light states and the corresponding dispersion relation : e(p ) e_0 + , where we require that @xmath42 . at this lattice",
    "spacing we find @xmath43 mev .",
    "the interpolated ( and extrapolated ) results for the @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) system are displayed in table [ bs_splittings ] ( table [ b_splittings ] ) .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 mass splittings are in agreement with experiment ( available only for the former ) and the findings of previous lattice studies @xcite .",
    "all ground - state eigenvector components have the same sign : i.e. , there are no nodes in the corresponding ground - state heavy - light wavefunctions .",
    "the first - excited s - wave displays a single node at @xmath48 ( @xmath49 found in @xcite ) .",
    "our mass results for the first - excited s - wave , however , appear to be higher than those found previously ( @xmath50 mev for @xmath51 ) .",
    "our mass plateaus for this state are rather suspect ( typically only 3 @xmath25 values were used in the fits ) .",
    "this issue can only be resolved with better statistics , which can be achieved a number of ways : more or larger configurations , more wall sources with locally gauge - rotated quark fields , more operators ( e.g. , non - straight paths ) .",
    "we would like to consider each of these options in the future , along with the inclusion of heavy - quark spin interactions to resolve more spin splittings in these heavy - light systems .",
