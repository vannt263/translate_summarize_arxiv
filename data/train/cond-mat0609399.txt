    "the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model is a paradigmatic _ toy model _ for long - range interacting hamiltonian systems @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite , baldovin and",
    "orlandini presented new molecular dynamics numerical results for the hmf model in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "they conclude that the energy distribution in its _ quasi - stationary state _ ( qss ) is of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) form . in view of their own numerical results",
    ", we can not agree with their conclusions . in this paper",
    "we present three points that are relevant for the interesting questions raised in @xcite .",
    "in what follows we present three important points regarding the non - boltzmannian nature of the qss in the hmf model . + _",
    "( i ) the nature of the qss in the canonical setup presents differences with that in the microcanonical setup . _",
    "+ it has already been demonstrated that , in the microcanonical ensemble , the anomalous dynamics ( concerning the presence of a glassy phase , hierarchical structures , velocity correlations , aging , vanishing lyapunov exponents , etc ) , and therefore the statistical description of the qss , is strongly dependent on the initial conditions @xcite . _ a fortiori _ , it is thus not at all justified to _ extrapolate _ the conclusions for the canonical qss studied in @xcite to the microcanonical ones .",
    "although the authors themselves state in @xcite that the canonical qss s are only _ reminiscent _ of the microcanonical ones ( in fact they differ in the lifetimes , the relaxation times , and , most probably , also in the correlations ) , they neglect it in @xcite . in order to stress this point , in fig",
    "1 ( a ) we plot three numerical simulations in the microcanonical ensemble ( averaged over @xmath2 events ) for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and for different initial magnetizations @xmath5 .",
    "water - bag initial conditions were used @xcite . following the central limit theorem aspects recently revealed in @xcite , we illustrate in fig . 1 ( b ) the non - boltzmannian nature of this qss regime by studying the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the stochastic values @xmath6 defined as follows : @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the momenta of the @xmath10-rotator taken at fixed intervals of time @xmath11 inside the qss regime",
    ". we considered @xmath12 and n=500 intervals , one every @xmath2 units of time .",
    "the length of the time interval was varied as shown in fig . 1 ( c ) for the initial magnetization @xmath13 without any relevant change in the pdfs .",
    "an average over 10 events was also considered , in order to have @xmath14 values for the @xmath15 variables for each pdf . in case of no global correlations , as one would expect at equilibrium , the resulting pdf should be a gaussian . as fig .",
    "1(b ) shows , in our case , the gaussian distribution does _ not _ occur .",
    "in fact we have pdfs whose shape depends on the initial magnetization @xmath5 and the central region ( up to a few mean standard deviations ) of most of them is well fitted by @xmath1-gaussians . in particular for @xmath13 we get a @xmath1-gaussian with @xmath16 as in @xcite .",
    "we do not think that this is a universal value in this case , since we do not have a strictly zero largest lyapunov exponent as in @xcite .",
    "for the hmf model , the latter goes to zero as @xmath17 in the qss regime @xcite , while it remains finite at equilibrium at this energy value .",
    "we normalized the data to the corresponding standard deviations in order to compare them .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that strong correlations are present in our case indicating a deviation from the standard central limit theorem , as in @xcite .",
    "a more complete study on this point will be reported elsewhere . in any case",
    "the arguments discussed in @xcite , and in particular in fig .",
    "1(a ) of @xcite , do not apply to the microcanonical qss .",
    "the effects become increasingly stronger when the initial magnetization gets closer and closer to @xmath18 + _ ( ii ) the energy distribution of the qss can not be of the boltzmann - gibbs exponential form . _ + as clearly seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) of @xcite , the one - body momentum distribution is _ non_-gaussian .",
    "this excludes the bg exponential form as the energy distribution in full phase space @xmath0 , as proved ( _ by reduction to the absurd _ ) in what follows .",
    "this analytical fact can easily be enlarged to @xmath19-dimensional rotators , @xmath20 : @xmath21 , and @xmath22 correspond respectively to the ising , @xmath23 , heisenberg , and spherical models . in what follows",
    "we illustrate it , however , for @xmath24 , the case addressed in @xcite . + * theorem * 0.5 cm let @xmath25 be the hamiltonian of a @xmath26-body classical system , where the kinetic energy is @xmath27 , and the potential energy @xmath28 contains arbitrary _ integrable _ one - body , two - body , three - body , ... terms , concerning ( isotropic or anisotropic ) rotators localized at a ( irregular or regular @xmath29-dimensional ) lattice ( each term might be characterized by a distance - dependent coupling constant , which can be summable or not in the @xmath30 limit ) . and",
    "let the one - momentum marginal probability distribution @xmath31 associated with the joint distribution @xmath32 be _ non - gaussian_. then @xmath32 _ can not _ be proportional to @xmath33 + 0.25 cm * proof : * 0.15 cm assume that @xmath34 then @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 which is a gaussian , thus contradicting the hypothesis . _",
    ". _    hence , the central limit theorem verification exhibited in @xcite refers to a necessary but insufficient property .",
    "+ 0.5 cm    0.5 cm _ ( iii )",
    "the baldovin - orlandini results do not exclude the nonextensive statistical mechanics @xmath1-exponential form . _",
    "+ contrary to what is stated in @xcite , @xmath1-statistics @xcite can not be excluded on the basis of what they exhibit in their fig .",
    "indeed , in fig .",
    "2 we plot the statistical weights corresponding to bg statistics ( full circles ) , and to a typical illustration of nonextensive statistics ( @xmath38 ; solid line ) , for the @xmath39 example exhibited in fig .",
    "3(d ) of @xcite .",
    "we used nearly the same number of points of fig .",
    "3(d ) in the interval @xmath40 $ ] , which covers @xmath41 around its central value @xmath42 .",
    "the linear correlation is @xmath43 ( @xmath44 in @xcite for a similar analysis ) .",
    "the remarkable closeness of the @xmath45 and @xmath38 examples comes from two facts .",
    "the first one is that @xmath46^{1/(1-q)}=e^x[1+\\frac{1}{2}(q-1)x^2 + ... ] , ~~ for ~~x\\to 0.\\ ] ] notice the absence of the term _ linear _ in @xmath47 in the latter expression . while the second one is that the spreading around the central value @xmath42 is very small .",
    "notice also that we rescaled @xmath48 by a factor @xmath26 , which corresponds to multiplying the hamiltonian ( 1 ) of @xcite by m and then rescaling time in the kinetic energy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the _ microscopic _ two - body interaction of the model _ independent _ from the _ macroscopic _ quantity @xmath26 , as desirable .",
    "consider also that , in the @xmath1-statistical weight of fig .",
    "2 , we have subtracted from @xmath49 a characteristic macroscopic energy , namely the central value @xmath42 .",
    "this procedure is long known to be mandatory ( see @xcite ) for any @xmath50 in order to preserve the invariance of probabilities with regard to an uniform shift of the energy scale , i.e. , in order to preserve the freedom of the choice of the zero of energies .",
    "such subtraction , although allowed for all values of @xmath1 , is clearly _ not _ mandatory for the bg exponential weight ( @xmath45 ) , since the desired invariance is anyhow guaranteed by the fact that the exponential of a sum factorizes into the product of exponentials ( whereas the @xmath1-exponential of a sum does _ not _ factorize into the product of @xmath1-exponentials if @xmath50 ) .",
    "on the basis of the points here discussed , the results presented in @xcite should be considered with extreme care , and by no means they close the ongoing debate on the possible application , in appropriate limits , of generalized @xmath1-statistics to long - range hamiltonian systems .",
    "finally , let us mention for completeness that neither the arguments recently advanced in @xcite exclude the possible application of @xmath1-statistics , especially for initial magnetization close to @xmath51 , but this point is beyond the scope of the present paper and it will be discussed elsewhere .",
