    "this coarse - graining implements a global scale transformation , in that it produces a renormalization group flow ( in the space of ground states and , when applied by conjugation , in the space of local hamiltonians ) with the expected structure of rg fixed points , both at criticality and off criticality @xcite .",
    "these fixed - points are characterized by an explicitly scale invariant wave - function .    as illustrated in fig .",

    "accordingly , the mera does not define a single wave - function , but a collection of wave - functions , one for each of the lattices in a sequence of increasingly fine - grained ( or coarse - grained ) lattices .",
    "these wave - functions are all mutually consistent in that for any pair of wave - functions , there exists ( by construction ) a uniform fine - graining or coarse - graining transformation that maps one wave - function to the other . notice that we can order all the wave - functions in this collection from most fine - grained to most coarse - grained .",
    "_ local scale transformations. _ individual disentanglers and isometries can also be used to coarse - grain a region of the lattice without coarse - graining the rest .",
    "we would like to think of such a transformation as a local scale transformation . in order to show that individual disentanglers and isometries properly implement a local scale transformation",
    ", we investigate whether they indeed act on the lattice consistently with what we expect of a local scale transformation in the continuum . in a quantum critical system ,",
    "the ground state in the continuum is often the vacuum of a conformal field theory .",
    "conformal invariance in 1 + 1 dimensions implies in particular that applying certain local scale transformation to the ground state on the infinite line should result in a thermal state on the infinite line ( and on a finite circle after a quotient ) . by showing that the same is true with the mera",

    "[ fig : local2 ] shows an example of the result of applying a local scale transformation to a mera by adding and/or deleting disentanglers and isometries .",
    "accordingly , the mera defines an even larger collection of wave - functions than mentioned above .",
    "each wave - function in this collection corresponds to a different way in which we locally coarse - grain the most refined lattice under consideration .",
    "all these wave - functions are once again mutually consistent , since by construction there is a local scale transformation mapping any pair of such wave - functions .",
    "notice that this time we can define a _ partial order _ in the set of wave - functions , according to whether one wave - function is more coarse - grained than another .",
    "this order is only partial because the map connecting the two wave - functions may require both coarse - graining one region and fine - graining another region , in which case none of the wave - functions is coarser or finer than the other .",
    "_ causal structure. _ the mera can be understood as a quantum circuit with some auxiliary time running from top to bottom @xcite .",

    "[ fig : causal ] shows the causal cone of one site .",

    "notice that the causal cone expands back in time at 45@xmath57 with respect to the horizontal .",
    "we can think of 45@xmath57 as corresponding to a null or lightlike direction , less than 45@xmath57 as corresponding to a spacelike direction , and more than 45@xmath57 as corresponding to a timelike direction .",
    "this analogy makes sense , since 45@xmath57 defines the direction of propagation of information in the quantum circuit .",
    "( null or lightlike ) .",

    "[ fig : local2 ] shows an example of a slice of the network that is piecewise horizontal and at 45@xmath57 .",
    "_ scale transformations and entanglement renormalization. _ we conclude this appendix by pointing out that one can also coarse - grain a lattice ( both globally and locally ) by using instead the isometries of a _ tree tensor network _",
    "@xcite which corresponds to a mera with trivial disentanglers . in this case",
    ", however , at criticality we do not recover explicit invariance under global scale transformations or produce a thermal state under the local scale transformation studied in this paper .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that a coarse - graining transformation based only on isometries fails to properly remove short - range entanglement .",

    "<S> the lightlike - identified component is an approximate isometry when @xmath32 is not too small ; we discuss this important point in more detail below . because they are isometries , these regions do not affect the spectrum of the state ; their role is instead to perform a change of basis . </S>",

    "<S> discussion. _ the tensor network manipulations conducted in this paper illustrate how the optimized mera encodes local conformal symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> if we declare the open indices on these new networks to be uniformly spaced , the procedure of erasing or adding tensors acquires the interpretation of a local conformal transformation : @xmath46 the fact that a subsequent quotient of the network reproduces the thermal state on a circle confirms that our manipulations correctly emulated the logarithmic map .    </S>",
    "<S> to implement a more general map @xmath47 , we can imagine proceeding in a similar fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to look for a set of indices with spatial locations that approximate @xmath48 for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this encodes the function @xmath50 in terms of a meandering cut through mera such as the one shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : local2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the height at which the cut is drawn reflects the step between consecutive ticks , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which is how @xmath50 resets a local scale . in terms of the causal structure of mera , only piecewise spacelike and lightlike cuts are sensible , because timelike cuts are not related to the regular lattice by an isometry ( see also appendix  a ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the discrete nature of the tensor network restricts the class of functions @xmath50 that can be adequately represented by such a cut ; this select class is compatible with the discretization scheme defined by mera . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , mera defines a scheme for realizing discrete local conformal transformations in a theory with a cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> one additional caveat is that because mera represents the wave - function at a given time , cuts through mera can only implement ` diagonal ' conformal transformations , which preserve an equal time slice of the cft .     </S>",

    "<S> , width=321 ]    it is useful to examine our results in reference to the tnr algorithm @xcite , which transforms the discretized euclidean path integral to a mera network @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> discretizing the path integral explicitly breaks conformal symmetry ; if this symmetry is indeed represented by different cuts in mera , it must be restored through the application of tnr . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with @xcite , where the use of tnr to map the plane to a cylinder was seen to reproduce other features of local scale invariance , namely the correct spectrum of scaling dimensions from a transfer matrix in scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our results add to the evidence in @xcite that tnr restores the conformal invariance of the euclidean path integral broken by the choice of discretization .    </S>",
    "<S> our mera representation of the thermal state on a circle is not the first ; another one appeared in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly contrast the two constructions , leaving a more detailed comparison to appendix  c. the quotient construction of the present paper proceeded in the following sequence : the path integral that prepares the ground state was discretized , turned into mera via tnr @xcite , passed through a logarithmic conformal map ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ log2]-[4log2 ] and figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : local](b - c ) ) , and finally quotiented . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proceeded in a different order : the continuum path integral was first mapped logarithmically to a strip and only then discretized , with the subsequent steps ( passing to the mera description via tnr and taking the quotient ) applied in either sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence of the two constructions tells us that conformal transformations commute with discretization  with the understanding that tnr and the procedure of adding or erasing tensors adopted in this paper implement conformal maps in the discretuum .    the construction of the thermal state as a quotient of the vacuum is well known in holographic duality @xcite , where the gravitational dual of the thermal state on a circle ( the btz black hole ) is a geometric quotient of the dual to the vacuum ( pure ads@xmath53 space ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the quotient of the mera network can be directly translated into the language of geometry . according to @xcite , the three constituents of the quotient mera  the timelike , lightlike and spacelike - identified regions  correspond to the geodesics that cross the black hole horizon , skirt it closely , and </S>",
    "<S> remain away from it . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest are the nearly isometric , lightlike - identified regions . </S>",
    "<S> tensors that live in these regions see more than a full fundamental domain of open indices in their causal cone , so the coarse - graining they perform acts on scales larger than the spatial circle . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of such super - ir scales for understanding black hole spacetimes was conjectured in @xcite based on purely geometric considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the lightlike - identified regions of the quotient mera are a tangible realization of this conjecture . </S>",
