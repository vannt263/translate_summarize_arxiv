    "establishing the statistical mechanics of the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) is one of the most challenging problems in physics . in analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics ,",
    "a possible and desirable answer to this problem would be an ensemble theory with which we could write down the density matrix ( or distribution function ) for a ness . to proceed in this direction ,",
    "it is important to extract the characteristics of density matrices for nesss by constructing and analyzing nesss in various systems .    to realize a ness in a concrete system",
    ", we should put the system in contact with heat baths or reservoirs that absorb the energy dissipated from the system .",
    "we thus have to treat open systems to analyze ness . in quantum systems ,",
    "one of the theoretical frameworks widely used for open systems is the quantum master equation ( qme ) @xcite , an equation of motion for the density matrix of the system .",
    "in fact , the qme is used in various fields of physics : e.g. , quantum optics @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , electron transfer in chemical physics and biophysics @xcite , heat transport @xcite , electronic transport in mesoscopic conductors @xcite , spin transport @xcite , and nonequilibrium thermodynamics and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "therefore , the qme is a reliable approach to investigating ness in various systems ( c.f . ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in some solvable models , analytical expressions of the ness of the qme",
    "are obtained @xcite .",
    "apart from solvable models , however , there appears a difficulty in analyzing the ness of the qme .",
    "this is because one should treat a huge number of components in the qme ; the number of elements of a density matrix ( mixed state ) is the square of that of a wave function ( pure state ) .",
    "this restricts available system size to be relatively small when one employs direct methods ( direct diagonalization or time integration ) in solving the qme , even though efficient numerical methods are developed @xcite .    a method of treating larger systems in the framework of the qme is the stochastic unraveling of qme ( also known as quantum jump , quantum trajectory , and monte carlo wave function method )",
    "@xcite . in this method , since one treats a wave function instead of a density matrix , one can investigate systems larger than those in the direct methods .",
    "this method , however , requires a monte carlo calculation ; i.e. , one must take an average of many times of iterative computations .",
    "there are also other methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a density matrix renormalization group method with a matrix product operator ansatz is proposed .",
    "this method assumes the ( rather phenomenological ) local action of the dissipators associated with the baths . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a many - particle green function method is proposed .",
    "this requires the approximation of weak internal coupling or small system size .    in this paper",
    ", we propose another method of calculating the ness of the qme .",
    "we use a perturbation theory with respect to the coupling strength ( pump / loss rate ) between the system and the reservoirs .",
    "our method assumes only the weak system - reservoir coupling , which is the same assumption as that of the qme . in this method ,",
    "the unperturbed part of the ness has only diagonal elements in the energy eigenstate basis .",
    "thus , the number of elements of the unperturbed part is on the same order as that of the wave function .",
    "we can therefore treat systems as large as those in a stochastic unraveling method .",
    "moreover , since this method does not require monte carlo calculation , it is expected to be faster than the unraveling method .",
    "we also note that the markovian approximation use in the qme holds exactly for the steady - state solution , since the approximation is good when the system changes slowly @xcite .    in the present paper , we describe the method in a setup of a system that is weakly coupled to two reservoirs . in the next section ,",

    "[ section : main ] , we give the main result , i.e. , the perturbative solution for the ness of the qme .",

    "however , combined with the following second step , @xmath87 is a useful starting point to obtain ness .    in the second step ,",
    "taking @xmath87 as the unperturbed eigenvector , we perform the first - order perturbation calculation with respect to @xmath58 [ see eq .",
    "( [ generator2 ] ) ] .",

    "the other point is that , to calculate @xmath101 , we have to determine not all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath55 but only the right eigenvector for the zero eigenvalue .",
    "we thus construct a perturbative method of calculating the ness @xmath84 of the qme ( [ qme ] ) : @xmath121 ( or equivalently , @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) with eq .",

    "the numerical limitation of the system size in the present method comes from the maximum matrix size of the system hamiltonian @xmath7 .",

    "one of the ways to treat larger systems is to take only a relevant part of the eigenstates of @xmath7 ; for example , in low - temperature cases , it is expected to be sufficient to use only low - energy eigenstates ( computed by , for example , the lanczos method ) .",
