    "the _ classical contact process _ was introduced by harris  @xcite as an interacting particles system modelling the spread of a population on the sites of @xmath0 .",
    "it is more specifically defined as a continuous - time markov process @xmath1 which splits up @xmath0 into living sites ( @xmath2 ) and dead sites ( @xmath3 ) and which evolves along the following two rules :    1 .",
    "if a site is alive then it dies at rate @xmath4 ; 2 .",
    "[ hic ] if a site is dead then it turns alive at rate @xmath5 times the number of its living neighbors .    note",
    "that the above point  [ hic ] can also be read as follows : a living site gives birth to its neighbors at rate @xmath5 , which clearly justifies the name of contact process .",
    "krone  @xcite later introduced a variant of this model , the so - called _ two - stage contact process _ , for which there exists an intermediate juvenile type that is forced to mature before it can produce any offspring .",
    "the state of the process at time @xmath6 is given by an element @xmath7 .",
    "a site in state @xmath8 is still interpreted as dead but living sites are now classified in two categories : a site in state @xmath4 is considered as young , while a site in state 2 is seen as adult. the model then evolves along quite different rules : only adults can give birth ( at rate @xmath5 ) , each new offspring is considered as young , and transition from young to adult occurs at rate @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend both above - mentioned models by considering a contact process _ with aging _ , that is a model where each living particle is endowed with an age in @xmath10 ( we denote by @xmath11 ) .",
    "the state of this process at time @xmath6 is therefore described by an element @xmath12 , and its dynamics are defined in the same spirit as above : a dead site turns alive ( with age one ) proportionally to the ages of its so - called fertile neighbors , while a living site ages at rate @xmath9 and dies at rate @xmath4 .",
    "full details regarding this evolution procedure , as well as a convenient graphical construction of the process , will be provided in section  [ model ] .    in  @xcite",
    ", krone shows that the two - stage contact process is additive and monotone with respect to its parameters .",
    "he also exhibits some bounds on the supercritical region and concludes the paper with a few open questions related to the problem .",
    "recently , foxall has solved some of these problems in  @xcite : he has shown , for example , that finite survival and infinite survival are equivalent and he also proved that the complete convergence holds . with these considerations in mind , and",
    "going back to our model , our first task in section  [ ssurvival ] will be to identify suitable conditions on the parameters for the process to survive .",
    "a crucial issue regarding the contact process ( or its extensions to a random / randomly - evolving environment ) is to understand the behaviour of the process in the different regions .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite , steif and warfheimer show that the critical contact process in a randomly - evolving environment dies out , while in  @xcite , garet and marchand establish an asymptotic shape theorem for the contact process in random environment .",
    "we will elaborate on the process in the survival case through the exhibition of a shape theorem : there exists a norm @xmath13 on @xmath14 such that the set @xmath15 of points alive before time @xmath6 satisfies for every @xmath16 , almost surely , for every large @xmath6 , @xmath17 where @xmath18^d$ ] , @xmath19 is the unit ball for @xmath13 .",
    "let us briefly sketch out the main steps towards this shape theorem .",
    "actually , in a similar way as in the case of the classical contact process , the proof divides into two distinct parts :    * we first prove that , as soon as the process survives , its growth is at least linear . to do so , we will resort to a similar construction as the one given by bezuidenhout and grimmett in  @xcite , and show that a supercritical process conditioned to survive stochastically dominates a two - dimensional supercritical oriented percolation ( section  [ sbezgrim ] ) .",
    "the required growth controls indeed follow from this construction ( section  [ scontrols ] ) . as an additional by - product of the percolation construction",
    "we obtain the fact that krone s process dies out on the critical region .",
    "* the second step will consist in exhibiting a shape result knowing that the growth is of linear order .",
    "this is analogue to the result of durrett and griffeath for the classical contact process  @xcite , and to the result of garet and marchand  @xcite in the random environment case .",
    "let us return to on the second step .",
    "just as in the classical case , the contact process with aging is a non - permanent model for which extinction is possible , and we therefore look for a shape theorem for the process conditioned to survive .",
    "the first step is to prove the convergence of the hitting times in one fixed direction @xmath20 , that is the convergence , as @xmath21 tends to infinity , of the ratio @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for the first time when the process hits @xmath24 . in 1965 ,",
    "hammersley and welsh  @xcite introduced subadditive techniques to show such a convergence in the case of first passage percolation . since then , proofs of this type of convergence use the kingman subadditive ergodic theorem  @xcite and its extensions , which appeal to subadditivity , stationarity and integrability assumptions on the system .    in non - permanent models such as the one described by our process",
    ", the extinction is possible and the hitting times can be infinite so that the standard integrability conditions are not satisfied . on the other hand , if we condition the model to survive , then stationarity and subadditivity properties can be lost . to overcome such lacks , we will lean on an intermediate quantity , introduced in  @xcite and denoted by @xmath25 , which morally represents a time when the site @xmath26 is alive and has infinitely many descendants ( see definition  [ defsigma ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this function @xmath27 satisfies adequate stationarity properties as well as the almost - subaddivity conditions involved in kesten and hammersley s theorem  @xcite , a well - known extension of kingman s seminal result",
    ". the last part of the proof will then be devoted to the control of the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath6 , and it will allow us to turn the shape theorem for @xmath27 into the expected shape theorem for @xmath6 .",
    "in the contact process with aging , the infection parameter @xmath5 is replaced with a sequence @xmath28 of birth parameters .",
    "we assume that :    1 .",
    "[ initial ] @xmath29 and @xmath30 , 2 .",
    "[ croissante ] @xmath31 is non decreasing , 3 .",
    "[ fini ] @xmath32 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is the birth parameter for a particle of age @xmath34 .",
    "the condition  [ fini ] means that the rate of birth is bounded for every age ; the condition  [ croissante ] means that the rate of birth is non decreasing with age .",
    "these two conditions are reasonable for the model and are useful for coupling in the sequel .",
    "the condition  [ initial ] account in particular for the fact that a dead site can not give birth to its neighbors .",
    "the contact process with aging ( cpa ) is a continuous - time homogeneous markov process @xmath35 taking values in the set of maps from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( we can also see @xmath38 as a partition of points of @xmath36 according to their age ) . if @xmath39 we say that @xmath40 is dead , while if @xmath41 we say that @xmath40 is alive with age @xmath34 .",
    "the evolution of the process is as follows :    * a living site dies at rate @xmath4 independently of its age , * a dead site @xmath40 turns alive at rate @xmath42 ( with @xmath30 ) , * each new offspring has age one , * the transition from age @xmath21 to age @xmath43 occurs at rate @xmath44 , independently of its age .",
    "these evolutions are all independent from each other . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the set of cadlag functions from @xmath46 to @xmath47 : it is the set of trajectories for markov processes with state space given by the maps from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a function with finite support .",
    "we start the process from the initial configuration @xmath49 .",
    "the set @xmath50 is the set of living points and each such @xmath26 has age @xmath51 .",
    "notations in special cases :    * if it is not specified ( as in @xmath52 ) , then the initial set is the point @xmath8 with age @xmath4 . *",
    "if the initial set is @xmath53 , where all particles have age 1 , then we denote the corresponding process by @xmath54 . *",
    "if the initial set is a single point @xmath20 with age @xmath55 , then we denote the corresponding process by @xmath56 . if @xmath57 , then we denote the corresponding process by @xmath58 .",
    "our model is a generalization of krone s model  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if we set @xmath59 and for every @xmath60 , @xmath61 we get krone s infection pattern of parameters @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 ) .    just as in the contact process situation , we use harris procedure to construct the cpa on an appropriate probability space .",
