    "inflation gives the most natural solution to the horizon and the flatness problems of the big - bang theory as well as generates the primordial perturbations @xcite , whose properties well coincide with the recent observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite .",
    "models of inflation can be classified into two categories with respect to relevant degrees of freedom during inflation : single - field models and multiple field models .",
    "recently , the most general single field inflation model with the second order equations of motion  @xcite has been invented in the context of horndeski @xcite and galileon theories @xcite .",
    "then , the bispectra of primordial curvature @xcite and tensor perturbations @xcite are obtained as well as their powerspectra @xcite .    effective scalar fields are ubiquitous in the extensions of the standard model of particle physics such as supergravity and superstring .",
    "then , it is well motivated to consider multiple field models of inflation .",
    "such multiple field models are roughly divided into three classes : ( i ) only one field is light , while the other fields are very heavy compared to the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "generically , this class virtually falls into the single field category  @xcite .",
    "however , it is recently discussed that heavy modes can affect the dynamics of light mode in some particular cases  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) there are multiple light fields , in which isocurvature perturbations are generated in addition to curvature perturbations .",
    "( iii ) only one field is light , while the masses of other fields are comparable to the hubble scale during inflation . this class is called quasi - single field inflation model  @xcite .    in supergravity ,",
    "inflation necessarily involves supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , whose effects are transmitted into other scalar fields as hubble induced masses @xcite .",
    "therefore , quasi - single field inflation is naturally realized in supergravity and it is well motivated by the model building based on supergravity or inspired by superstring .",
    "furthermore , it is known that massive isocurvature modes which couple to the inflaton and have hubble scale masses can give significant impacts on primordial curvature perturbations . in the original paper  @xcite by chen and wang , it was shown that , for example , scalar three point functions take the intermediate shapes between local and equilateral types .",
    "based on these backgrounds , we would like to discuss quasi - single field inflation model in general settings .",
    "recently , effective field theory approach to inflation has been invented in  @xcite , which is based on the symmetry breaking during inflation : time diffeomorphism is broken by the time - dependent background evolution during inflation .",
    "then , based on the unbroken time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism , the effective action for inflation can be constructed systematically in unitary gauge , where inflaton is eaten by graviton and there are no perturbations of inflaton . by use of the stckelberg trick",
    ", the curvature perturbation can be associated with the goldstone boson  @xmath0 , which non - linearly realizes the time diffeomorphism .",
    "the key observation is that the goldstone @xmath0 could decouple from the metric fluctuations in some parameter region which we call the decoupling regime . in the decoupling regime ,",
    "the dynamics of goldstone @xmath0 is described by a simplified action , which does not contain metric perturbations . as a consequence ,",
    "calculations of scalar perturbations are also simplified and seeds of non - gaussianities become clear .    in this paper , we apply this effective field theory approach to quasi - single field inflation .",
    "first , in unitary gauge , we write down the most general action invariant under the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism and constructed from graviton and the massive isocurvature mode .",
    "the obtained action is expanded systematically in fluctuations and derivatives around the frw background . by the stckelberg trick",
    ", we introduce the action for goldstone boson and carefully discuss its decoupling regime . using the action in the decoupling regime , the power spectrum is calculated in the general setting of quasi - single field inflation .",
    "the momentum dependence of scalar three - point function is also discussed in the general setting .",
    "our framework can be also applied to inflation models with heavy particles . as an application",
    ", we make a qualitative discussion on the effects of heavy particles during inflation and that of sudden turning trajectory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "in the next section , we briefly review the effective field theory approach and quasi - single field inflation . in sec.[section_most_general ] , the most general action for quasi - single field inflation is constructed via effective field theory approach .",
    "the decoupling regime of the obtained action is also discussed . in sec.[section_ps ] , the power spectrum is calculated first in the general setting of quasi - single field inflation with constant mixing couplings . then , the effects of sudden turning trajectory on the power spectrum is qualitatively discussed . in sec.[section_squeezed ] ,",
    "the momentum dependence of scalar three - point functions are discussed .",
    "final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "technical details of the calculation of the power spectrum are summarized in appendices .",
    "in this section we briefly review the effective field theory approach to inflation developed in  @xcite and the quasi - single field inflation model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "inflation is an accelerated cosmic expansion with an approximately constant hubble parameter : @xmath1 it is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the time - diffeomorphism : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a certain scalar operator .",
    "here we chose the frame in which the vacuum expectation value of @xmath3 is spatially uniform . assuming the degrees of freedom relevant to the cosmological perturbation and invariance under the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism , @xmath4 , which is not broken by the condensation  @xmath5",
    ", we can construct the effective action for inflation .    in the simplest case ,",
    "relevant degrees of freedom are three physical modes of graviton : two transverse modes and one longitudinal mode related to the inflaton .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , any action of graviton invariant under the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism can be written in terms of the riemann tensor @xmath6 , the time - like component of the metric @xmath7 , the extrinsic curvature @xmath8 on constant-@xmath9 surfaces , the covariant derivative @xmath10 , and the time coordinate  @xmath9 : @xmath11 where all the free indices inside the function @xmath12 must be upper @xmath13 s .",
    "note that @xmath7 should be treated as a scalar when considering its covariant derivative , and we can use @xmath14 for example .",
    "the explicit form of the extrinsic curvature @xmath8 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a unit vector perpendicular to constant @xmath9 surfaces and @xmath17 is the induced spatial metric on constant @xmath9 surfaces . in  @xcite , it was shown that the action  ( [ general_single_1 ] ) can be expanded around a given frw background as @xmath18\\,,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath19 starts with quadratic terms of the arguments @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and all the free indices must be upper @xmath13 s .",

    "notice that the action of single field inflation in the uniform inflaton gauge can be reproduced by gauge - fixing the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scalar perturbation .    for the calculation of correlation functions of the scalar perturbation @xmath26 , it is convenient to introduce the action for the goldstone boson @xmath0 by the stckelberg method .",
    "we perform the following time - diffeomorphism on the action  ( [ s_grav_unitary ] ) in the unitary gauge : @xmath27 in general , the transformation  ( [ unitary_to_pi ] ) is realized by the following replacement : @xmath28 where we dropped the tilde for simplicity and @xmath7 transforms , for example , as @xmath29 the transformation rules of @xmath8 and @xmath30 also follow from  ( [ replacement ] ) straightforwardly",
    ". these procedures lead to the following action for the goldstone boson @xmath0 : @xmath31\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dots stand for the terms corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "the obtained action enjoys the time - diffeomorphism by assigning to @xmath0 the non - linear transformation rule because of the time - dependent free parameters such as @xmath32 or @xmath33 . expanding the parameters in @xmath0 , we find , for example , that @xmath0 has a mass term @xmath34 , which is sub - leading in the slow - roll approximation . ] @xmath35 and the action in the unitary gauge can be reproduced by gauge - fixing the time - diffeomorphism as @xmath36 .",
    "it is important to recognize that , in the action ( [ action_pi ] ) , terms with graviton fluctuations have less derivatives than those without graviton .",
    "because of this property , it is expected that the mixing of the goldstone boson and graviton becomes irrelevant to the dynamics of the goldstone boson at a sufficiently high energy scale . for example , let us consider the following simplest case : @xmath37\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the canonical normalization ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , the mixing term @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 and it can be neglected in the energy scale @xmath42 . in other words , when the slow - roll parameter @xmath43 is small , the mixing becomes irrelevant inside the horizon .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 inside the horizon are then determined by the following action in the decoupling limit : @xmath44\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the metric reduces to the frw background .",
    "more generally , the mixing of the goldstone boson and graviton becomes irrelevant inside the horizon when the free parameters of the action are in some regime ( decoupling regime ) as in the slow - roll regime for the above simplest case . in the decoupling regime",
    ", the calculation of scalar correlation functions also becomes tractable .",
    "taking the spatially flat gauge @xmath45 the scalar perturbation @xmath25 is given by @xmath46 at the linear order , and the calculation of correlation functions of @xmath26 reduces to those of @xmath0 , which can be obtained using the simplified action in the decoupling limit .",
    "this kind of simplification in the decoupling regime is one of the advantages to use the effective field theory approach . in the next section",
    "we extend this approach to quasi - single field inflation .",
    "the original model  @xcite of quasi - single field inflation is described by the following matter action : @xmath47\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the tangential and radial directions of a circle with radius @xmath50 and the potential @xmath51 along the tangential direction is of slow - roll type .",
    "the homogeneous backgrounds and their equations of motion are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "expanding the action around the homogeneous background , it yields the following second order action of the fluctuations @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mixing coupling @xmath57 converts the @xmath58 coupling , for example , into three point functions of @xmath59 , and hence this model can potentially give a large non - gaussianities .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the squeezed limit of scalar three point functions is sensitive to the mass of @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "as this simple model implies , massive scalar fields of hubble scale mass can cause a non - trivial behavior of non - gaussianities . in the following sections we discuss more general setting for quasi - single field inflation using the effective field theory approach .",
    "in this section , we construct the most generic action of quasi - single field inflation using the effective field theory approach . after constructing the action in the unitary gauge first",
    ", we derive the action for the goldstone boson @xmath0 and discuss its decoupling regime .",
    "relations between our approach and models in the literatures are also discussed .      in the unitary gauge ,",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom in quasi - single field inflation are three physical modes of graviton and an additional scalar field @xmath60 .",
    "the typical mass of @xmath60 is supposed to be of the order of the hubble scale during the inflationary era . in this subsection",
    ", we construct the most generic action invariant under the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism from graviton and the scalar field @xmath60 up to the third order fluctuations . here",
    "it should be noticed that the action constructed in this section can be applied to any two field models because no conditions on @xmath60 are imposed . , @xmath64 , which is assumed in multi - field inflation  @xcite .",
    "the mass of @xmath60 is not necessarily of order hubble scale so that the action constructed in this section can be applied not only for quasi - single field inflation but also inflation models with an additional heavy scalar . ]",

    "sums of terms linear in the fluctuations can be practically second order . for example , let us consider the term @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "although this kind of action seems to be first order apparently , it turns out to be second order after taking into account the equation of motion for @xmath60 : @xmath69 .",
    "then , the function @xmath19 seems to contain such a combination of linear order terms .",
    "however , using the relation @xmath70 we can rewrite it into the second and higher order terms in @xmath60 , @xmath20 , and @xmath71 .",
    "similar discussions hold for more general cases and we conclude that @xmath19 starts with quadratic terms of @xmath20 , @xmath60 , @xmath21 , and @xmath67 .",
    "see also appendix b in  @xcite . ] then , let us write down possible terms in the action up to the third order fluctuations .",
    "schematically , we write the action in the following way : @xmath72 where the first term @xmath73 in the right hand side denotes terms constructed from @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath67 , the second term @xmath74 denotes those only from @xmath60 , and the last term @xmath75 denotes those mixing the graviton fluctuations and @xmath60 . as discussed in  @xcite , the first term @xmath73 can be expanded as @xmath76\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dots stand for terms of higher order in the fluctuations or with more derivatives . when we rewrite the action in the unitary gauge in terms of the goldstone boson  @xmath0 , the terms displayed in  ( [ s_grav ] ) are described by @xmath0 and its first order derivatives .",

    "<S> we apply the effective field theory approach to quasi - single field inflation , which contains an additional scalar field with hubble scale mass other than inflaton . based on the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism , which is not broken by the time - dependent background evolution </S>",
    "<S> , the most generic action of quasi - single field inflation is constructed up to third order fluctuations . using the obtained action , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the additional massive scalar field on the primordial curvature perturbations are discussed . in particular , we calculate the power spectrum and discuss the momentum - dependence of three point functions in the squeezed limit for general settings of quasi - single field inflation . </S>",
    "<S> our framework can be also applied to inflation models with heavy particles . </S>",
    "<S> we make a qualitative discussion on the effects of heavy particles during inflation and those of sudden turning trajectory in our framework . </S>"
