    "-0.10 in    the quasar luminosity function , @xmath1 , provides fundamental information about their nature .",
    "boyle et al . ( 1990 , 2000 ) found that @xmath1 for quasars at redshifts @xmath2 resembles a `` broken '' power law which becomes _ flatter _ at the faint end .",
    "they also demonstrated that the `` break '' luminosity at which the slope changes increases with redshift , and between @xmath3 and @xmath4 becomes more luminous by 1.9 mag .",
    "a peculiar aspect of this result is that the apparent magnitude corresponding to the `` break '' luminosity changes by only 0.8 mag . over this redshift range ( @xmath5=18.619.4 ; that is , the differential distribution of quasar apparent magnitudes has a shape very similar to the shape of their luminosity function ) .",
    "further , this apparent magnitude range is only @xmath6 1 - 2 mag . above the photographic plate limit used for selection .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the flattening of the luminosity function is due to a systematic underestimate of the increasing incompleteness at the faint end of the uv - excess selection technique employed by boyle et al .",
    "indeed , hawkins & veron ( 1995 ) , using a variability - selected sample with 300 objects , argued that `` the luminosity functions for redshifts of less than 2.2 show a featureless power law , with no sign of a ` break ' . ''",
    "the @xmath7 sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) spectroscopic quasar sample is limited to @xmath8 , and thus not deep enough to reliably constrain the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "the color selection by uv excess from the sdss photometric sample ( essentially based on sdss @xmath9 color , see richards et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) is limited by the photometric accuracy in the @xmath10 band to @xmath11 , which would be just barely sufficient to detect a change of the slope of counts at @xmath12 . however , the coadding of sdss multi - epoch photometry produces @xmath131 mag .",
    "deeper @xmath10-band measurements at a given accuracy , and allows a robust identification of uv - excess selected candidates to @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , multi - epoch data can also be used to select quasar candidates by variability , using techniques similar to those employed by hawkins & veron .",
    "this is the first time that it is possible to contrast the conflicting results of boyle et al .",
    "and hawkins & veron using the same homogeneous data set .",
    "-0.25 in    we selected low - redshift quasar candidates by requiring @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( based on the criteria of richards et al .",
    "their counts , and counts for two control samples , are shown in fig .",
    "the differential counts of selected candidates rise steeply ( log(@xmath17 ) vs. @xmath18 slope @xmath60.75 ) at the bright end ( @xmath19 , or @xmath20 ) , and then the slope changes to @xmath60.30 .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the results of boyle et al . , who used a similar selection technique .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that sdss photometric catalogs based on digital data are much more accurate ( 0.02 mag .",
    "errors , see ivezi et al .",
    "2003 ) than the catalogs used by boyle et al . which were derived from a photographic survey .",
    "in particular , the gap between the distribution of quasars and more numerous blue thick disk and halo stars ( centered on @xmath21 , see the top left panel in fig .",
    "1 ) cleanly separates the two populations .",
    "we note that some of the uv - excess selected candidates are not quasars : the results of sdss spectroscopic follow - up ( @xmath22 ) indicate that @xmath23 are stars ( dominated by white dwarfs ) .",
    "this correction , however , has no effect on the conclusion that the slope of differential counts changes because there are about 10 times fewer quasar candidates at @xmath24 than predicted by extrapolating the counts for @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , star / galaxy separation is not an issue : even if resolved sources were added to the point sources , the counts would be qualitatively unchanged ( i.e. the uv - excess sources are heavily dominated by point sources ) .",
    "-0.25 in    quasars are variable sources with amplitudes of several tenths of a magnitude for time scales longer than a few months ( e.g. hawkins & veron 1995 ) .",
    "the top left panel in fig .",
    "2 shows the correlation between variability in the @xmath0 band , @xmath25 , and @xmath9 color for point sources observed twice two years apart .",
    "a large majority of variable sources , defined by @xmath26 , show uv excess ( @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) . even without accounting for the fact that some variable sources are stars ( which would further increase this fraction )",
    ", this high fraction implies that uv - excess and variability selection techniques yield similar samples ( see the two bottom panels in fig .",
    "2 ) . alternatively",
    ", 47% of sources selected by uv - excess have @xmath26 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the counts of variability - selected quasar candidates , which we define as _ all _ sources with @xmath29 , also show a change of slope at @xmath30 .",
    "of course , this selection could be further refined ; for example , rr lyrae stars , which dominate the variable star population , can be easily removed due to their distinctive colors and much shorter variability time scale ( ivezi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "such improvements would only further increase the similarity of differential counts for uv - excess and variability selected quasar candidates .",
    "-0.25 in    -0.35 in",
    "-0.25 in    the counts of quasar candidates selected by both uv - excess and variability techniques using multi - epoch sdss imaging data change slope around @xmath31 .",
    "this result provides strong support for the quasar luminosity function and its evolution advocated by boyle et al . , and demonstrates that both techniques produce similar samples when applied to high - quality data .",
