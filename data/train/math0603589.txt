    "a closed incompressible surface @xmath1 embedded in a 3-manifold @xmath2 is called _ acylindrical _ if the manifold @xmath3 , obtained by cutting @xmath2 along @xmath1 contains no essential annuli ( a properly embedded annulus in a 3-manifold is essential if it is incompressible and not boundary parallel ) .",
    "acylindrical surfaces are interesting in connection with geometry , as every totally geodesic surface in a hyperbolic 3-manifold is acylindrical , and every acylindrical surface in a hyperbolic link complement is quasi - fuchsian . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath1 is an acylindrical surface in a closed , irreducible and atoroidal 3-manifold @xmath2 then @xmath4 admits a hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary @xcite .",
    "in @xcite hass proved that for the finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds there is a constant @xmath5 , independent of the manifold , so that each acylindrical surface in a manifold @xmath2 has genus at most @xmath6 .",
    "he used this result to show that in any compact 3-manifold there is only a finite number of acylindrical surfaces .",
    "it seems natural to ask if there are similar bounds which hold for all 3-manifolds and depend not on volume , but on some topological measures of complexity .",
    "some candidates could be the number of tetrahedra in a triangulation or the heegaard genus of the manifold , and in the case of knots and links , the crossing number , the bridge number or the tunnel number .",
    "such bounds must exist in the case of the number of tetrahedra in a triangulation or the crossing number of a link , as there are only finitely many manifolds and links for each number @xmath7 .",
    "we find explicit bounds in these cases , and furthermore show that there is a linear bound in terms of the number of rational tangles in a link projection or the number of alternating tangles in a prime knot projection .",
    "the fact that 3-manifolds with heegaard genus 2 and the complements of knots with tunnel number 1 contain no separating acylindrical surfaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) could suggest that -at least for small heegaard genus or tunnel number- there could be bounds for the genus of such surfaces . we show here that for each @xmath0 , there are tunnel number 2 knots which contain a closed acylindrical surface of genus @xmath0 . by performing suitable dehn surgeries , we get closed manifolds of heegaard genus @xmath8 which contain closed acylindrical surfaces of genus @xmath0 .",
    "these examples show that heegaard genus 3 manifolds and tunnel number 2 knots are already quite complicated .",
    "we also consider what happens when the acylindrical assumption is weakened to require that there are no essential annuli running from the surface to a boundary torus ( in the case of hyperbolic knots and links this means that the surface is quasi - fuchsian ) .",
    "we show that a knot that can be decomposed into two alternating tangles can not contain any quasi - fuchsian surfaces in its complement . on the other hand , we find hyperbolic 3-bridge knots whose complements contain infinitely many quasi - fuchsian surfaces .",
    "these knots have an essential branched surface which carries quasi - fuchsian surfaces of arbitrarily high genus .",
    "these examples show that there are no bounds for the genus of quasi - fuchsian surfaces based on volume , crossing number or the number of tetrahedra .",
    "finally , by means of suitable dehn fillings and double covers , we produce manifolds of heegaard genus 2 and homology spheres of heegaard genus 3 which contain infinitely many incompressible surfaces .",
    "these examples are interesting , for it seems that all known examples of hyperbolic manifolds with infinitely many surfaces have noncyclic homology , and in the case of knots with infinitely many surfaces , it seems that the only known explicit examples are some satellite knots ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the examples are also interesting for the study of surfaces in the complement of 3-bridge knots , as they supplement results of finkelstein and moriah @xcite , who showed that many 3-bridge knots contain an incompressible but meridionally compressible surface , and of ichihara and ozawa @xcite , who proved that any closed surface in the complement of a 3-bridge knot is meridionally compressible or annular .",
    "if a closed 3-manifold @xmath2 admits a ( pseudo)triangulation with @xmath7 tetrahedra then the genus of a 2-sided closed acylindrical surface in @xmath2 is at most @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a ( pseudo)triangulation of @xmath2 with @xmath7 tetrahedra , and denote by @xmath11 the @xmath12-skeleton of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an incompressible surface in @xmath2 in normal position with respect to the triangulation , so @xmath1 intersects the faces of the tetrahedra along arcs and the interior of the tetrahedra along discs which are triangles or squares .",
    "assume further that @xmath1 has been isotoped to minimize the number of intersections with @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the boundary of a regular neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 is two - sided , @xmath14 consists of two copies of @xmath1 . by definition @xmath1 is acylindrical iff @xmath16 contains no essential annuli .",
    "the edges of @xmath14 in each face of a tetrahedron split the face into triangles , quadrangles , pentagons and/or hexagons , and each edge is adjacent to a quadrangle ( which lies in @xmath15 ) .",
    "call an edge _ good _ if the other adjacent region ( which lies in @xmath16 ) is also a quadrangle .",
    "notice that if an embedded curve @xmath17 in @xmath14 is made of good edges , then the union of these adjacent quadrangles in @xmath16 forms an annulus @xmath18 that joins @xmath17 with another curve @xmath19 in @xmath14 .",
    "we claim that if @xmath17 is essential in @xmath14 then the annulus @xmath18 is essential",
    ". otherwise @xmath18 would be isotopic to an annulus @xmath20 bounded by @xmath17 and @xmath19 in @xmath14 ( in particular , @xmath17 must be 2-sided in @xmath14 ) . as @xmath1 is 2-sided in @xmath2 ,",
    "then @xmath20 is parallel to an annulus @xmath21 in @xmath1 and the isotopy from @xmath22 to @xmath18 can be used to isotope @xmath21 ( pushing it even further across @xmath18 ) to reduce the number of intersections of @xmath1 with @xmath13 .",
    "so if @xmath14 is acylindrical , then the good edges of @xmath14 carry no embedded essential curves , and so they carry no essential curves at all .",
    "but as the edges of @xmath14 split @xmath14 into discs , they must carry all of @xmath23 .",
    "so there must be at least as many non - good edges in @xmath14 as the rank of @xmath23 . as the number of non - good edges in a face of a tetrahedron is at most 6",
    ", the total number of non - good edges in @xmath14 is at most @xmath24 , so @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath14 , and so the genus of @xmath1 is at most @xmath27 .    in order to get the better estimate one needs to look more carefully at the graph @xmath28 formed by the edges of @xmath14 .",
    "divide the non - good edges in each tetrahedron in two classes : those lying in triangles of @xmath14 that cut off outermost corners of the tetrahedron will be called _",
    "fair edges _ and the others ( which may lie in squares or triangles ) will be called _ bad edges _ ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 1    let @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the subgraphs of @xmath28 made of good edges and fair edges respectively .    observe that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are disjoint , that is , have no vertices in common .",
    "as the components of @xmath30 lie in the links of the vertices of a triangulation of the manifold @xmath2 , all curves contained in @xmath30 are contractible in @xmath2 , and so as @xmath14 is incompressible then @xmath30 contains only trivial curves of @xmath14 .",
    "all curves contained in @xmath29 are also trivial because @xmath14 is acylindrical .",
    "so as @xmath31 contains only trivial curves of @xmath14 , by attaching to @xmath31 some of the complementary pieces of @xmath14 we obtain a ( possibly empty or disconnected ) simply connected subcomplex @xmath32 of @xmath14 .",
    "now the euler characteristic of @xmath14 is @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 count the vertices , edges and faces of @xmath14 that do not lie in @xmath32 .",
    "so @xmath36 counts some bad edges -some others may lie in @xmath32- and @xmath37 counts the triangles and squares adjacent to them .",
    "it can be shown directly that in each tetrahedron @xmath38 , every subcollection @xmath39 of the set of squares and triangles of @xmath40 @xmath41 with bad edges satisfies the inequality @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , we may take @xmath39 to be the set of squares and triangles with bad edges not contained in @xmath43 . as @xmath14 has two components and each of them contains a component of @xmath32 or a vertex",
    ", it follows that    @xmath44    and so @xmath45 .",
    "the genus of an acylindrical surface in a manifold is not bounded in terms of its heegaard genus , as we show in section 3 . however , there is a bound depending on the complexity of a heegaard splitting .",
    "let @xmath46 be a heegaard splitting of @xmath2 of genus @xmath0 , and let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be discs splitting @xmath49 and @xmath50 into 3-balls @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the complexity of the heegaard splitting with respect to these discs is just the minimal intersection number between the boundaries of the discs .",
    "the complexity of a heegaard splitting is the minimum complexity among all such systems of discs .",
    "if a closed 3-manifold @xmath2 admits an irreducible heegaard splitting of genus @xmath0 and complexity @xmath7 then the genus of a closed acylindrical surface in @xmath2 is at most ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be a heegaard splitting of @xmath2 of genus @xmath0 as above , with @xmath54 meeting @xmath55 in @xmath7 points .",
    "let @xmath1 be an acylindrical surface in @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath1 is incompressible , we may assume that @xmath1 meets @xmath50 along @xmath0 stacks of parallel discs in @xmath56 ( some stacks may be empty ) .",
    "we may also assume that @xmath1 meets @xmath51 along discs and that it meets each @xmath57 along stacks of parallel arcs connecting different components of @xmath58 .",
    "as before , consider the graph of intersection @xmath28 of @xmath14 with @xmath59 .",
    "call an edge of @xmath28 on @xmath57 _ good _ if it is an interior arc of a stack , otherwise call it _ bad_. call an edge of @xmath28 in @xmath60 _ good _ if it is part of the boundary of an interior disc of a stack .",
    "otherwise ( i.e. , if it is part of the boundary of an outermost disc of a stack ) call it _",
    "fair_. see figure 2 .",
    "figure 2    observe that the subgraphs @xmath29 and @xmath30 made of good edges and fair edges do not meet .",
    "as the components of @xmath30 are contained in the boundaries of discs in @xmath61 then @xmath30 carries no essential curves of @xmath14 , and as @xmath1 is acylindrical we may assume as in the proof of 2.1 that @xmath29 carries no essential curves either .",
    "so as @xmath62 carries no essential curves and @xmath28 splits @xmath14 into discs , the rank of @xmath23 is bounded above by the number of bad edges .",
    "if @xmath57 meets the @xmath63 in @xmath64 points then @xmath65 ( because the heegaard splitting is irreducible ) and @xmath57 contains at most @xmath66 bad edges , so the rank of @xmath23 is at most @xmath67 and so the genus of @xmath1 is at most @xmath53 .",
    "there are other ways of measuring the complexity of a heegaard splitting , for example , by means of the curve complex , as defined in @xcite .",
    "note however that no such bound for the genus of acylindrical surfaces exists for this complexity , for in fact , all the examples constructed in section 3 have a heegaard splitting of genus 3 which comes from a certain bridge presentation of a knot , and then by a similar proof to theorem 1.4 of @xcite , the distance in the curvecomplex is @xmath68 .",
    "we now consider bounds for the genus of acylindrical surfaces in the exterior of knots and links in the 3-sphere .",
    "if @xmath69 is a knot or link with @xmath7 crossings then the genus of a closed acylindrical surface in the exterior of @xmath69 is at most @xmath70 .",

    "let @xmath75 be the part of the projection sphere outside the @xmath76 s .",
    "then @xmath77 cuts @xmath78 into @xmath79 polyhedral balls @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , ... , @xmath84 , with faces determined by the equators of the bubbles and the arcs of @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath1 is an incompressible surface in the exterior of @xmath69 then @xmath1 can be isotoped to meet @xmath81 and @xmath80 along discs , meet each @xmath85 along parallel saddle - shaped discs , and meet their faces along arcs .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "figure 3    let @xmath14 be the boundary of a regular neighborhood of @xmath1 , and let @xmath28 be the graph of intersection of @xmath14 with @xmath86 .",
    "so @xmath28 splits @xmath14 into discs .",

    "see figure 4 .",
    "figure 4    again the subgraphs @xmath29 and @xmath30 of @xmath28 are disjoint , and if @xmath14 is acylindrical then @xmath29 carries no essential curves of @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath30 can be regarded as lying on the boundary tori of a regular neighborhood of the link @xmath69 .",
    "but as @xmath14 is acylindrical , there can be no essential annuli running from @xmath14 to @xmath69 , so @xmath30 contains no essential curves of @xmath14 .",
    "so , as the graph @xmath28 carries all of @xmath23 , there must be at least as many bad edges as the rank of @xmath23 .",
    "as there are at most @xmath90 bad edges on each @xmath12-gon determined by the projection of @xmath69 into @xmath71 , the number of bad edges in @xmath14 is at most    @xmath91 arcs of @xmath69 in @xmath92    @xmath93    so the rank of @xmath23 is at most @xmath94 and the genus of @xmath1 is at most @xmath95 .",
    "after we proved proposition 3 , we learned that agol and d. thurston , following lackenby @xcite , showed that the volume of a hyperbolic knot of link is bounded above by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the volume of a hyperbolic ideal tetrahedra and @xmath98 is the twist number of @xmath69 ( the minimum number of twists in a diagram of @xmath69 , where a twist is a string of 2-gons or a crossing in the diagram ) .",
    "agol has also shown @xcite that if a hyperbolic manifold @xmath2 has an acylindrical surface of genus @xmath0 , then @xmath99 .",
    "it follows that the genus of an acylindrical surface in the exterior of a hyperbolic link @xmath69 is at most @xmath100 .",
    "these results suggested the following .",
    "recall that a tangle is a 3-ball @xmath51 together with two properly embedded arcs .",
    "the tangle is rational if the arcs are isotopic ( rel @xmath101 ) to arcs in @xmath102 .",
    "we will say that a knot or link @xmath69 in @xmath103 is decomposed into tangles if there is a sphere @xmath71 and 3-balls @xmath104 , @xmath105 , ... , @xmath106 each intersecting @xmath71 in a disc , so that @xmath107 is a tangle , and the part of @xmath69 outside these balls is a collection of arcs lying on @xmath108 .    if a link is decomposed into @xmath7 rational tangles , then the genus of a closed acylindrical surface in its complement is at most @xmath109 .    draw the projection of the link @xmath69 as the union of @xmath7 rational tangles in the interior of @xmath7 disjoint spheres @xmath72 , @xmath73, ... ,@xmath74 joined by @xmath110 disjoint arcs in the projection sphere .",
    "let @xmath75 be the part of the projection sphere outside these spheres .",

    "moreover , as @xmath116 is a rational tangle , we may isotope @xmath1 to intersect @xmath117 along parallel discs that separate the strings of the tangle , and we may assume that their boundaries meet each hemisphere of @xmath76 along 2 or 3 families of parallel arcs -2 if the tangle is a crossing and 3 otherwise ( a single family of parallel arcs implies that the discs are vertical and the tangle has no crossings of @xmath69 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be the boundary of a regular neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath1 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath14  with @xmath87 gives a cell decomposition of @xmath14 and cuts the faces of @xmath87 into quadrangles that lie in @xmath15 and other polygons that lie in @xmath118 ; as before , let @xmath28 be the graph of intersection .",
    "call an edge of @xmath28 in a face of @xmath87 _ good _ if the adjacent polygon in @xmath118 is a quadrangle with another edge on @xmath14 ( so the two edges are parallel in that face ) .",
    "otherwise , call an edge in @xmath28 _ fair _ if it is adjacent to a quadrangle in @xmath75 with a side in @xmath119 that is adjacent to another quadrangle in @xmath75 with a side in @xmath28 ( so both edges of @xmath28 are parallel to this arc of @xmath69 ) or if it is adjacent to a polygon in a hemisphere of @xmath76 with exactly 2 sides in @xmath28 ( so the other sides lie in the equator and are separated by points of @xmath120 ) . call the other edges of @xmath28 _",
    "bad_. note that edges lying on some @xmath88 and parallel to an arc of @xmath89 which contain a point of @xmath69 are bad .",
    "see figure 5 .",
    "figure 5    one can use the fair edges as well as the good edges to construct annuli for @xmath14 , by taking the quadrangles that lie between two fair edges in @xmath87 ( but that may intersect @xmath69 ) and pushing them outside the corresponding @xmath76 , or if they lie in @xmath75 , to the side of @xmath75 that does nt contain an edge of @xmath28 connecting the two fair edges ( there ca nt be connecting edges on both sides because the union of the four edges would be a meridian of @xmath69 , and so @xmath1 would be meridionally compressible ) .",
    "this creates quadrangles in @xmath121  connecting pairs of fair edges , and one can see that the quadrangles corresponding to consecutive fair or good edges match well .",
    "as before , if a simple essential curve in @xmath14 is made of good and fair edges then the annulus formed by the union of the adjacent quadrangles is essential or else @xmath1 could be isotoped to reduce its intersection with @xmath86 .",
    "so , if @xmath1 is acylindrical , the subgraph of @xmath28 consisting of the good and fair edges can not contain any essential curve of @xmath14 , so it is contained in a simply connected subcomplex @xmath32 of @xmath14 . again , as @xmath14 has two components and @xmath28 divides them into discs , @xmath122 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 count the vertices , edges and discs in @xmath123 , and so @xmath124 .",
    "as there are at most 4 bad edges and 8 fair edges on each @xmath76 , all contained in the 2 outermost discs of @xmath125 , the number of bad edges minus the number of discs that contain them in @xmath126 is at most @xmath110 .",
    "there are at most @xmath127 families of parallel edges on each face of @xmath75 determined by @xmath128 arcs of @xmath69 , not including the families of edges parallel to the arcs of @xmath69 , and they produce at most @xmath129 bad edges on each face",
    ". if an arc of @xmath69 has parallel families edges of @xmath28 on both sides , then there are two bad edges in these families , for the edges closest to @xmath69 are fair . if an arc of @xmath69 has only edges of @xmath28 on one side , then there are two bad edges in this family , since in this case the edge closest to @xmath69 is not fair .",
    "so , if no face of @xmath75 is a monogon the number of bad edges in @xmath75 is at most @xmath130 .",
    "when @xmath131 , the previous formula undercounts the number of bad edges in the monogon as @xmath132 instead of @xmath133 -there are no edges in the monogon as they could be isotoped into @xmath85 to eliminate two intersection curves of @xmath40 with @xmath76- . in this case",
    "there can not be bad edges around the endpoints of the monogon in @xmath76 and so the discs of intersection of @xmath14 with @xmath76 are vertical and the tangle is trivial -unless @xmath14 does not meet @xmath76 at all , so there is an overcount on the number of bad edges in @xmath126 by at least @xmath134 and also on the number of bad edges in the face of @xmath75 adjacent to the monogon .",
    "so the previous bound also holds when some faces of @xmath75 are monogons .",
    "finally observe that since @xmath14 has 2 components and each of them must meet @xmath112 and @xmath113 , there must be at least 2 discs of @xmath123 inside each of these balls .",
    "so , @xmath135    consider a tangle as above , i.e. , it is determined by the intersection of a 3-ball @xmath51 with a link @xmath69 , so that @xmath136 is a disc , where @xmath71 is a projection sphere , and @xmath137 consists of 4 points lying on @xmath71 .",
    "we say that the tangle is alternating if its arcs can be isotoped , keeping @xmath102 fixed , to have an alternating projection on the sphere @xmath71 .",
    "note that each rational tangle is alternating .",
    "the next result extends theorem 1 to allow alternating tangles .",
    "if a prime knot is decomposed into alternating tangles , @xmath7 of them rational , then the genus of a closed acylindrical surface in its complement is at most @xmath109 .",
    "the proof is based on the following :    let @xmath69 be a nonseparable link or a knot and @xmath71 a sphere that meets @xmath69 in 4 points .",
    "then each acylindrical surface @xmath1 in @xmath138 is isotopic to one that either i ) is disjoint from @xmath71 or ii ) intersects @xmath71 in one curve or iii ) meets one of the components of @xmath139 along parallel discs .",
    "the sphere @xmath71 separates @xmath69 into two tangles .",
    "isotope @xmath1 to minimize its intersection with the 4-punctured sphere @xmath140 .",
    "the intersection then contains no trivial curves , and as @xmath1 is meridionally incompressible then it does not contain curves surrounding only one puncture , so all the curves @xmath141,@xmath142, ... @xmath143 in which @xmath1 intersects @xmath71 must be parallel in @xmath140 . as @xmath1 is acylindrical , if there is more than one @xmath144 then the annuli connecting two of them in @xmath71 can not be essential , so either one annulus is isotopic ( rel @xmath145 ) to an annulus in @xmath1 ( and the isotopy can be used to remove two @xmath144 s ) or all the @xmath144 s bound discs of @xmath1 .",
    "so at least one of them , say @xmath141 , bounds a disc @xmath146 in @xmath1 that lies completely on one side of @xmath71 .",
    "but then , as all @xmath144 s are parallel to @xmath147 , one can draw parallel discs @xmath148 in @xmath138 on that side of @xmath71 that meet @xmath1 at @xmath144 ( and nowhere else ) .",
    "the union of the discs bounded by the @xmath144 s in @xmath1 and the @xmath148 s form spheres in @xmath138 , and if @xmath69 is a knot or a nonseparable link these spheres bound balls in @xmath138 , so the @xmath148 s must be isotopic to the discs in @xmath1 , and the isotopy reduces the number of curves unless the discs in @xmath1 were already on one side of @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath69 is a prime knot and @xmath116 is an alternating tangle , then every acylindrical surface in the complement of @xmath69 can be isotoped to meet @xmath149 along parallel discs or be disjoint from it .",
    "assume for the moment that claim 2 is true , and isotope the surface @xmath1 to meet only the @xmath85 s corresponding to separable tangles . to estimate the genus of @xmath1 we would like to count the number of bad edges and discs of @xmath40 that contain them by replacing each nonseparable tangle in the diagram of @xmath69 by a trivial tangle to get a knot @xmath150 and counting the bad edges of @xmath14 in its diagram .",
    "figure 6    now some bad edges in the diagram of @xmath69 may become fair in the diagram of @xmath150 as in figure 6 , but in this case we may regard them as originally being  almost fair  -there is a quadrangle joining them that lies above or below the nonseparable tangles that were between them in the diagram of @xmath69 .",
    "the quadrangles corresponding to almost fair edges match well with the other quadrangles corresponding to good and fair pairs of edges , so they can be used as well to construct annuli for @xmath14 .",
    "so the same bound for the number of bad edges and discs -and therefore the same bound for the genus of @xmath1- holds .",
    "the proof of claim 2 is based on the following extension of the meridional lemma of menasco @xcite .",
    "if a link @xmath69 intersects a ball @xmath51 in an alternating tangle , then every meridionally incompressible surface in the complement of @xmath69 can be isotoped to intersect @xmath51 along copies of a surface that separates the strings of the tangle .",
    "draw @xmath51 as a round ball with @xmath151 lying in an equatorial disc except at the crossings , that lie on the surface of small `` bubbles '' @xmath114 , @xmath152, .... as in figure 3 .",

    "note that if we give the weights @xmath362 , for @xmath363 , then this is a collection of positive weights , which is consistent , and determines a connected surface of genus @xmath27 .",
    "if a knot @xmath218 is not hyperbolic then it is either a torus knot or a satellite knot .",

    "this implies that a 3-bridge knot which contains an essential surface of genus greater than 1 must be hyperbolic .",

    "let @xmath370 be an arc of intersection which is outermost on @xmath292 , and which bounds a disc @xmath372 disjoint from @xmath218 .",

    "so if there is such a disc @xmath292 , it must be disjoint from the @xmath148 , and by inspection it is not difficult to check that such disc does not exist .",
    "the part of @xmath348 contained in @xmath366 consists of one annulus , corresponding to the curve @xmath377 . again",
    "an innermost disc / outermost arc argument shows that there is no monogon .",

    "the part of @xmath348 contained in @xmath367 consists of an annulus , corresponding to the curve @xmath378 ; it is also not difficult to check that there is no monogon . similarly , the part of @xmath347 contained in @xmath368 consists of a three punctured sphere and an once punctured torus , and @xmath348 consists of two annuli , corresponding to the curves @xmath379 and @xmath380 ; again it is not difficult to check that these are incompressible and that there is no monogon .    to see that @xmath218 is not parallel to @xmath346 , suppose there is an annulus @xmath18 , with one boundary being @xmath218 and the other on @xmath346 .",
    "again look at the intersections between @xmath18 and the discs @xmath148 , and get that the arc of the knot that lies in the solid torus @xmath10 must be parallel to @xmath360 , but this is not possible by the choice of such an arc .    the explicit knot shown in figure 14(a ) has more interesting properties , it is a ribbon knot and it has unknotting number one , where a crossing change is located in the arc contained in the solid torus @xmath10 .      let @xmath218 be a knot as in theorem 6 .",
    "let @xmath381 be the manifold obtained by performing dehn surgery on @xmath218 with slope @xmath210 .",
    "if @xmath382 , where @xmath344 denotes a meridian of @xmath218 , then @xmath381 is irreducible by @xcite , and @xmath346 remains incompressible in @xmath381 by @xcite , for @xmath218 is not parallel to @xmath346 . if @xmath383 , then @xmath381 is atoroidal by @xcite .",
    "so if @xmath383 , @xmath381 is an atoroidal haken manifold , hence it is hyperbolic .",
