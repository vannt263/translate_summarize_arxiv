    "the radio frequency ( rf ) spectrum is becoming overly crowded due to an exponential growth in the number of applications and users that require high - speed wireless communication , anywhere , anytime @xcite .",
    "the situation just gets worse in indoor environments , such as conference halls or shopping malls , where both the user density and the bandwidth demands are tremendous .",
    "moreover , the indoor rf spectrum is crowdedly occupied by a plethora of coexisting wireless services , including cellular networks , wifi networks , bluetooth systems , wireless sensor networks or the internet of things , to name a few . to accommodate the tremendous wireless data demands from high density of users of different services ,",
    "high - efficiency spectrum - sharing approaches are highly desired .",
    "currently , the cognitive radio @xcite and adaptive beamforming @xcite are two main dynamic spectrum access solutions that have drawn most attentions . on the one hand , cognitive radio techniques enable unlicensed wireless users to share channels with licensed users that are already using an assigned spectrum @xcite .",
    "although cognitive radio achieves better spectrum efficiency when the licensed users do not access the band frequently ( such as tv white space ) , it does not help when all users are very active with high density , especially in the aforementioned indoor environments .",
    "more importantly , cognitive radio techniques require each wireless device to be able to scan a wide range of frequencies to identify spectrum holes and then lock to that frequency , which necessitates expensive transceivers , antennas , and processors that are not available in most existing devices , if not all . on the other hand ,",
    "usually beamforming techniques require smart antenna systems to adaptively focus the transmission and reception of wireless signals @xcite . to achieve high spatial resolution to differentiate multiple simultaneous transmissions in the crowded indoor environments , each wireless device needs to be equipped with very large array of antenna elements , which is impossible for the current and future portable , wearable , or even smaller devices .",
    "[ fig.0 ]    to address the aforementioned problems , in this paper , we propose a new spectrum sharing technique based on smart reflect - arrays to improve indoor network capacity for literally any existing wireless services without any modification of the hardware and software in the devices . as shown in fig .",

    ", this paper demonstrates that significantly higher spectrum - spatial efficiency can be achieved by using the smart reflect - array without any modification of the hardware and software in the users devices .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system design and proof experiment are introduced in section ii .",
    "then , the transport capacity , including theoretical upper bounds and achievable bounds for arbitrary networks , is derived and analyzed in section iii .",
    "numerical analysis is presented in section iv .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section v.",
    "in this section , we first present the system architecture of the new reflect - array - based spectrum sharing solution . then",
    ", an experimental testbed is designed and implemented to prove the feasibility of the proposed solution .",
    "the architecture of the proposed system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.0 ] .",
    "there are two pairs of wireless users in a conference room , whose devices can adopt any existing or future wireless services .",
    "the smart reflect - arrays hung on the walls can effectively change the signal propagations of any wireless transmission by tuning the electromagnetic response ( phase shift ) of each reflector unit on the panel .",
    "hence , the wireless signal from either transmitter can be spatially modulated and projected to arbitrary regions while not interfering other regions . as a result",
    ", each receiver clearly hears from the expected transmitter as if only such transmitter accesses the spectrum , while actually there can be many other wireless users and services simultaneously use the same frequency band .",
    "the reflect - array panel actually reconfigure the signal propagation .",
    "the spatial distribution of the signal strength from different transmitters forms a chessboard of high resolution regions , each of which is private for only one wireless transmission .",
    "since it is the reflect - array that manipulates the spatial modulation , the users can use any type of wireless devices and wireless services without any change in hardware or software .",
    "different from existing mimo , beamforming , or active relay techniques , the proposed smart reflect - array moderates the spatial distribution of multiple wireless transmissions in a passive way . as long an em wave - carried wireless transmission exists in the indoor environment ,",
    "no matter where it comes from ( e.g. , cell phone , laptop , bluetooth speaker , smart home sensors , or cleaning robots ) , the smart reflect - array(s ) can reconfigure the spatial distribution of the wireless energy due to such transmission .",
    "moreover , different from existing beamforming mechanisms , the proposed system achieves the spatial diversity in the middle of wireless transmissions , neither in the transmitter nor in the receiver .",
    "this property further guarantees the compatibility to all possible wireless systems .      to validate the feasibility of the proposed system",
    ", we develop a experiment testbed .",
    "since we expect to have a flexible control of the electromagnetic response on reflect - array , it is necessary to optimally design the reflect - array panel and its peripheral circuits . for the reflect - array design ,",
    "the basic idea is that by loading the microstrip patches with electronically - controlled capacitors , the resonant frequency of each reflector unit can be changed to increase the usable frequency range @xcite .",
    "more importantly , since the signals are required to be efficiently reflected on the reflect - array , the patches should be designed to have a satisfying reflection coefficient .    in this design",
    ", the reflect - array is used to work at an operating frequency of 2.4 ghz , which is suitable for wifi service in indoor environments .",
    "we design rectangle - structure patches as introduced in @xcite for the reflector units as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.design ] , where the dimensions of the patch are developed as @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath1 , @xmath3 @xmath1 .",
    "the distance between the patch and ground plane is @xmath4@xmath1 .",
    "the relative dielectric constant @xmath5 , which can be realized by most of the pcb fabrications .",
    "we design totally @xmath6 reflector units and each reflector is controlled by a bias voltage to tune the varactors ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) for changing the capacitance . a view of developed smart reflect - array",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.view ] .",
    "simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig.simulation ] show the electromagnetic response the reflector unit by comsol . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.rcs ] , by using an operating frequency of 2.4 ghz , the designed patch get the maximum radar cross section ( rcs ) , which means the reflection is optimized at such operating frequency . the energy distribution on the patch shown in fig . [ fig.energy ]",
    "further demonstrates that the resonance can be obtained at 2.4 ghz .    in this reflect - array , we use mega2560 micro - controllers as fig .",
    "[ fig.02a ] to generate pwm signals to control the reflectors .",
    "since totally @xmath9 reflectors need to be independently controlled , @xmath10 micro - controllers are used that each one outputs 12 independent pwm signals .",
    "rc low - pass filter is designed as fig .",
    "[ fig.02b ] to convert the pwm signal to a certain bias voltage from 0 to 5 volts .",
    "therefore , the reflectors become flexible to change the electromagnetic response to control the signals reflected on them .",
    "[ fig.11 ]    [ fig.12 ]    the experiment setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.01a ] , where a receiver ( rx ) is deployed @xmath11 @xmath12 in front of the reflect - array .",
    "a transmitting antenna ( tx1 ) working as the signal source is deployed @xmath11 @xmath12 away on left of the receiver .",
    "another transmitting antenna ( tx2 ) is deployed as well to interfere the communication between tx1 and rx .",
    "the reflect - array consists of @xmath6 reflectors and each reflector is controlled by a bias voltage to tune the varactors for changing the phase shift .",
    "micro - controllers are used to give a control voltage to each reflector patch .",
    "an overview of experimental facilities is shown in fig . [ fig.01b ] .    during the experiment , tx1 and",
    "tx2 are transmitting signals along the whole spectrum and the frequency response at rx is observed by spectrum analyzer . in fig .",
    "[ fig.11 ] , we respectively measure the received signal strength from tx1 and tx2 without reflect - array nearby .",
    "since the two transmission distances are the same ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) , the received signal strengths are almost the same around -45 dbm . in fig .",
    "[ fig.12 ] , by deploying the reflect - array and optimally tuning each reflector , the interference has been canceled to -73 dbm and the interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) is increased to about 30 db . in this way , the communication can be established between tx1 and rx by preventing them from the interference of tx2 .",
    "the experimental results prove the concept of the proposed spectrum sharing solution , where two simultaneous transmissions are considered .",
    "furthermore , we expect the smart reflect - array can be used to simultaneously accommodate a large number of indoor wireless users with different services in the very limited spectrum bands .",
    "the rf spectrum utilization efficiency can be leveraged to a brand new height , which benefit all possible wireless systems and services .",
    "thus , it is necessary to explore the capacity of spectrum sharing by considering multiple users in indoor environments . in this section ,",
    "we first analyze the effect of reflect - array on the communication by developing accurate channel models . based on the channel model , an upper bound on transport capacity",
    "is theoretically derived .",
    "then , an achievable transport capacity is derived based on a practical reflect - array control algorithm .",
    "it should be noted that , the objective in this paper is to find the maximum possible transport network capacity .",
    "therefore , we assume the network topology can be arbitrarily designed to achieve such capacity .",
    "such network topology is commonly considered as arbitrary network @xcite .",
    "[ fig.1 ]        [ fig.2 ]    the influence from the reflect - array to the channel is shown as fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the signal received at the receiving side is the superposition of the direct signal and the signals reflected by patch antennas .",
    "thus , the received signal strongly depends on the phases of the multi - path propagation .    assuming that the signal transmitted on baseband is a train of raised cosines bearing bpsk symbols @xmath13 , the received signal from channel shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] can be expressed in time domain : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the operating frequency .",

    "[ fig.2 ] , a number of @xmath23 users are served by the reflect - array to establish @xmath24 pairs of communication .",
    "not only the signal from the source will be reflected by the reflector but also the interferences from other transmitting nodes can get effect . therefore , the received signal at a certain receiving node @xmath25 @xmath26 can be written as : @xmath27 where the subscript @xmath28 indicates a transmitting node different from node @xmath25 .",

    "@xmath37 is the feasible data rate if simultaneous reliable communication at rate @xmath37 is possible for all communication pairs .",
    "since @xmath37 is usually set to be fixed in theoretical analysis , the upper bound of transport capacity is determined by @xmath38 , which can be derived from the restriction of sinr : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the threshold of sinr .",
    "according to ( [ sinr ] ) and ( [ restrictionsinr ] ) , we have : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of all receiving nodes .",
    "thus , the denominator of the left side in ( [ sinrresult ] ) indicates the noise plus the received power from the source and interferences . by considering the attenuation and phase shift with propagation distance , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the wave number .",
