    "in the early stage of the universe , black holes may have formed from cosmological density perturbations  @xcite .",
    "such `` primordial '' black holes ( pbhs ) may produce @xmath4-ray background radiation and cosmic rays through quantum evaporation or contribute to the density of the universe , and this leads to observational constraints on their number density  @xcite .",
    "studying the formation and evolution of pbhs therefore leads to important constraints on models of the early universe .",
    "however , to calculate these constraints , one needs to know how large pbhs were at their formation epoch and how much they subsequently increased their mass through accretion .",
    "a simple physical argument suggests that the size of a pbh will initially be comparable with the cosmological particle horizon scale for a hard equation of state  @xcite .",
    "this is because an overdense region at maximum expansion must be larger than the jeans scale in order to collapse against the pressure but not so large that it forms a separate closed universe .",
    "since both these scales are comparable to the particle horizon size , with the first being only slightly below the second , the size at maximum expansion must be finely tuned if a pbh is to form .",
    "( for a soft equation of state , the jeans scale is much smaller than the cosmological horizon scale , but the collapse is likely to lead to pancake formation and fragmentation unless the region is very spherically symmetric  @xcite , so one again needs fine - tuning . ) since the size of a region at maximum expansion is determined by its initial overdensity ( compared to the flat friedmann background ) , only density fluctuations with a narrow range of amplitudes can produce pbhs .",
    "the limits on the size of a pbh have only been estimated rather roughly in previous papers .",
    "however , the fraction of the universe going into pbhs is very sensitive to these limits  @xcite , especially if the fluctuations on a given scale have a gaussian distribution , so one would like to calculate them more precisely . in order to do this , we first need to determine the various cosmological scales that arise in the early universe : in particular , the cosmological particle horizon , the cosmological apparent horizon , the cosmological sonic horizon and the jeans length .",
    "depending on the formation scenario , these may all be relevant to pbh production .",
    "they all have the same order of magnitude but they also depend on the equation of state parameter @xmath5 ( where @xmath0 ) and one purpose of this paper is to calculate these dependencies for an exact friedmann model very precisely .",
    "the region undergoing collapse will not itself be part of a flat friedmann model , so in order to discuss the size of a pbh , one needs to make some assumption about the form of the overdensity .",
    "one approach is to assume that the universe is exactly friedmann beyond some matching radius . in this case , the black hole apparent horizon is necessarily within the matching radius but its precise position ( relative to some cosmological scale ) depends on the density profile in the overdense region .",
    "the simplest models have constant overdensity , in which case the region can be regarded as part of a closed friedmann model .",
    "however , more complicated possibilities can be envisaged , so it is important to obtain more general results .",
    "in this paper we will derive upper limits on the black hole size which are independent of any assumption about the density profile .",
    "in particular , we prove that the black hole apparent horizon size is considerably smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon scale for an equation of state parameter in the range @xmath6 . an important tool in proving these results",
    "is the use of double - null coordinates .",
    "this is partly because , with the highly non - linear fluctuations required for pbh formation , it is not always clear how to construct spatial hypersurfaces of constant time .",
    "it is also because double - null coordinates are convenient for numerical calculations .",
    "although we do not present such calculations here , we do present them in an accompanying paper  @xcite for the case in which the universe contains a scalar field .",
    "if the fluctuations which generate the pbhs derive from inflation or quantum gravity effects , they may effectively extend to infinity ( or at least well beyond the usual friedmann particle horizon ) rather than being confined to a finite region . in this case , the above results are inapplicable and the only firm upper limit on the size of the pbh comes from the separate universe condition .",
    "although this constraint has been discussed in general terms  @xcite , it can not be formulated precisely without specifying the density profile within the overdense region .",
    "however , we will show that it can be calculated exactly in terms of the equation of state parameter @xmath5 if the overdense region is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "the amount of accretion by a pbh is also sensitive to its initial size .",
    "a simple newtonian calculation  @xcite suggests that accretion is unimportant if the pbh is much smaller than the cosmological horizon at formation but that one could have self - similar evolution , with the black hole growing at the same rate as the universe , if the size is initially comparable with the cosmological horizon scale .",
    "the standard formation criterion implies that this is indeed the case , which suggests that there could be a large amount of accretion for a hard equation of state .",
    "however , self - similar pbh solutions have been studied extensively  @xcite and it has been found that no such solution contains a black hole inside an exact flat friedmann solution for a perfect fluid with @xmath7 .",
    "this applies even for a stiff fluid with @xmath2 , although this has been the subject of some controversy  @xcite .",
    "these results have been confirmed by numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "indeed simulations suggest that , the harder the equation of state , the more difficult it will be for a pbh to form and the smaller the mass accretion rate will be . also one can show that a relativistic effect suppresses the accretion when the pbh has a size very close to that of the cosmological apparent horizon  @xcite .",
    "if we adopt units in which @xmath8 and the abstract index notation of  @xcite , the einstein equations @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 we consider a spherically symmetric system , for which the line element can be written in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are advanced and retarded times , respectively . then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) , we obtain the following partial differential equations : @xmath15 there are no other independent components of the stress - energy tensor : spherical symmetry requires @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the initial data for the above equations are most naturally given on two initial null surfaces , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "on each null surface the geometry is described by the two functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the above considerations are completely general , but we now focus on the situation in which one has a black hole in a cosmological background . to make the discussion precise , we adopt a `` compensated '' pbh model , in which the black hole apparent horizon is contained within a perturbed region , which is surrounded by an exact flat friedmann solution beyond some ( generally finite ) radius .",
    "various approaches have been used in this context .",
