    "since its introduction in 1963 @xcite the hubbard model has found applications in many various systems . despite half - century research on this model it still holds a number of open questions .",
    "this report focuses on the atomic limit of the extended hubbard model , in which we restrict ourselves to the case of the zero - bandwidth limit ( ) . with added magnetic interactions of the ising - type between electrons .",
    "such a  simple model can be used for describing behavior of insulating magnets .",
    "the hamiltonian of the discussed model has the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath0  is the on - site density interaction , @xmath3  is @xmath1-component of the intersite magnetic exchange interaction , @xmath4 is chemical potential , and @xmath5 restricts the summation to nearest - neighbor sites .",

    "the electron concentration @xmath12 is defined as , where @xmath13 is the total number of sites .",
    "the rigorous ground state results for this model have been found in the case of a   chain @xcite and case @xcite .",
    "the exact results for finite temperature have been also obtained @xcite for chain ( an absence of long - range order at ) . within the variational approach",
    "the model has been analyzed for half - filing ( ) @xcite as well as for arbitrary electron concentration @xcite ( these results are rigorous in the limit of infinite dimensions ) .",
    "our preliminary monte carlo ( mc ) results have been presented in @xcite for strong on - site repulsion ( and ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate in details the phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of the model for arbitrary electron concentration and arbitrary chemical potential ( ) in the whole range of temperatures for a specific repulsive value of the on - site interaction parameter ( and ) . the corresponding results for and are obvious because of the electron - hole symmetry of the model on alternate lattices .",
    "the monte carlo simulations for the model described above have been done at finite temperatures using grand canonical ensemble on two dimensional ( ) square ( sq ) lattice with number of neighbors .",
    "one could depict such approach as adsorption of electron gas on a lattice .",
    "our simulations use a  local update method @xcite determined by elementary `` runs '' : ( i )  a  particle can transfer to another site , ( ii )  it can be adsorbed on a  lattice or ( iii )  it can be removed from the lattice .",
    "these `` runs '' are usually called _ move _ , _ create _ and _ destroy _ of particle procedures in mc simulations . every monte carlo step ( mcs )",
    "consists of each of these `` runs '' performed times . in our simulations",
    "the number of mcs is with a quarter of them being spent on thermalization , which is necessary to avoid results heavily influenced by the starting point of the simulations .",
    "there are also many cluster update algorithms , but due to chemical potential term in the hamiltonian they can not be implemented here .",
    "more details on the simulation method can be found in @xcite .",
    "simulations provide data for temperature and chemical potential dependencies of various thermodynamic variables .",
    "the variables of the particular interest are : staggered magnetization , magnetic susceptibility , and specific heat ( ) .",
    "because antiferromagnetic interactions ( ) are studied , staggered magnetization @xmath14 is an order parameter in the model considered , which is calculated as a difference of magnetization of sublattices @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( , ) . in the antiferromagnetic ( af )",
    "phase staggered magnetization is non - zero ( ) , whereas in the non - ordered ( no ) phase .",
    "as a  function of temperature @xmath18 for different system sizes @xmath19 ( as labelled ) for and . ]    the transitions in finite systems are not sharp and the finite - size effect on the order parameter @xmath14 is observed in the results of the mc simulations . in the no phase @xmath14 is larger than zero ( ) even above the transition temperature .",
