    "ecoepidemiology studies the influence of diseases among interacting populations .",
    "this rather new field of research started about a quarter of a century ago , with investigations merging diseases in demographic models in different contexts , @xcite .",
    "for a brief overview of the progress up to a few years ago , see chapter 7 of @xcite .",
    "much more recently , a novel idea for modeling herd behavior has been introduced , @xcite , and further explored in @xcite .",
    "it is essentially based on the observation that individuals gathering in groups can generally be attacked by predators on the outskirts of the territory that they occupy , that is proportional to their size .",
    "the population occupies thus a two - dimensional manifold , while its boundary represents a one - dimensional one .",
    "the former is directly related to the population size , while the latter instead must be then related to its square root .",
    "rather then pursuing this idea in various circumstances in ecological situations , @xcite , following the idea of extending these demographic remarks to ecoepidemic situations , @xcite , we want to exploit it here still in the ecoepidemic realm , but considering gatherings of infected individuals .",
    "in fact , we use the basic ideas on herd behavior , @xcite , in a different context . specifically , in @xcite as well as in @xcite",
    ", it is still the demographic part of the model that is modeled according to herd behavior . here , however , we assume that the infected lump together .",
    "their herd size grows due to the arrival of new individuals only through the susceptible contacts , wandering about independently of each other , with the infectious individuals positioned on the outskirts of the infected bunch .",
    "this may be plausible in the context of predators and prey interactions , because infected individuals , in general weaker and slower , may gather together .",
    "hence , their new possible recruits would arrive precisely through the above mechanism . as stated above , assuming thus that these populations occupy a certain portion of ground , predation occurs on the border , i.e. the perimeter , of the lump of infected individuals , therefore it is expressed via a square root term of their size .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we briefly summarize the results on the classical predator - prey reference model in the next section , then provide some basic information on the ecoepidemic models we want to introduce . in section [ sec:1 ] we consider the case of infected prey that are harmless for predators .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] contains the particular case in which the predators recognize and avoid infected prey . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we present the model for which infected are toxic for the predators .",
    "results on the boundedness of the systems trajectories are derived in the next section and a final summary of the results concludes the paper .",
    "let us consider the lotka - volterra predator - prey model with logistic correction for the prey @xmath0 .",
    "the predators @xmath1 are assumed to be specialists , so that in the absence of @xmath0 they would starve to death .",
    "the model reads @xmath2 the parameters are defined as follows : @xmath3 represents the predator s mortality rate , @xmath4 is the predator s hunting rate , @xmath5 is the prey reproduction rate , @xmath6 is the prey carrying capacity .",
    "this system dynamics is well known .",
    "there are only two possibly stable equilibria , since the origin is always unstable . between the predator - free point @xmath7 and coexistence",
    "@xmath8 there is a transcritical bifurcation .",
    "whenever the predators mortality rate falls below the threshold @xmath9 the predators invade the environment permanently , as @xmath10 becomes feasible and is unconditionally stable , while instead @xmath11 loses its stability .",
    "in each case , the only possible equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "in the ecoepidemic approach the main difference with the previous demographic model consists in the fact that the prey population is divided among infected @xmath12 , that gather in herds , and susceptibles @xmath13 .",
    "we also assume the presence in the ecosystem of a third population @xmath1 that can predate on @xmath13 as well as possibly on the @xmath12 lumped together . with this",
    "we mean that predation occurs always on the border of the lump of @xmath12 s , as in other herd behavior systems , @xcite .",
    "but the effect of predation on the infected can have different outcomes for the predators",
    ".    three cases will be considered , as far as the behavior of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath12 is concerned : they do not recognize the infected , but their predation leaves the @xmath1 s unaffected , they recognize the @xmath12 s and avoid them , or finally the @xmath1 s predate the @xmath12 s and the latter harm the predators .",
    "we stress here once again that the novelty of this model is in using the herd behavior in the epidemiological terms , especially in contrast with what was done in @xcite , where the major issue was on the infected behavior , but still considered from the demographic behavior point of view .",
    "the group gathering behavior is modeled as indicated above , via the square root of the infected population density @xmath14 .",
    "disease transmission occurs through contacts among the infected lying on the boundary of the herd with the susceptibles . assuming homogeneous mixing among these classes of individuals , the corresponding ( modified ) `` mass action '' term assumes the form @xmath15 .",
    "thus , our nonlinear disease incidence model could be regarded as a particular case of the @xmath16 incidence , which has been proposed among other epidemiological population interaction possibilities , see @xcite .",
    "f the following are further general assumptions for all the three models considered here : the lump of @xmath12 s does not reproduce , it can grow only by recruiting newcomers from the class @xmath13 .",
    "they are also too weak to exert any intraspecific competition on the healthy individuals @xmath13 , nor feel their pressure for the search for resources , since they do not reproduce .",
    "we also assume that the predators do not have other food sources , being specialists .",
    "with respect to the loose population @xmath13 the encounters with @xmath1 are on a one to one basis , i.e. they are expressed via the usual mass action law .",
    "the first model we investigate is the following one @xmath17 we define the meaning of all the parameters , because although we use the same notation as in ( [ mod_0 ] ) , the interpretation of the parameters common to both ( [ mod_0 ] ) and ( [ mod_2 ] ) is at times slightly different . here",
    "@xmath3 represents the predator s mortality rate , @xmath4 is the predator s hunting rate on healthy prey , @xmath18 is the predation rate on the infected herds of prey , @xmath19 is the disease incidence rate , @xmath5 is the healthy prey reproduction rate , @xmath6 is the carrying capacity of healthy prey , @xmath20 is the natural plus disease - related mortality rate of infected individuals .    in view of the fact that the prey modeled by the @xmath12 s lump together , predation on them is exerted only on the outer boundary of their herd , which is expressed by the square root term in the above first and third equations ( [ mod_2 ] ) .",
    "we need to redefine the dependent variables , to avoid a possible singularity in the jacobian when @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "singularity removal can be performed by defining @xmath21 .",

    "it is clearly seen also that no hopf bifurcation can arise here , in view of the strict inequality for the trace .",

    "we briefly examine here the particular case of ( [ mod_2 ] ) in which @xmath39 , i.e. the infected are recognized and completely disregarded by the predators .",
    "the system with no singularity and its jacobian are obtained just as particular cases of ( [ caso2bis ] ) and ( [ jac_caso2bis ] ) , setting in them @xmath39 .",
    "the possible equilibria are again all the points found earlier , namely the origin and the predator - free equilibrium @xmath32 with the very same population values .",
    "both these equilibria are both always feasible .",
    "we also find coexistence , which now simplifies to @xmath40 it is feasible only if @xmath41 this condition specifies that the predator s mortality must fall below a certain critical threshold .",
    "note that @xmath42 coincides with @xmath43 when the latter is evaluated for @xmath39 .",
    "the origin @xmath24 retains its unconditional instability , in view of the very same eigenvalues we found for ( [ caso2bis ] ) , namely @xmath30 , @xmath5 , @xmath31 .",
    "one eigenvalue of @xmath32 is now @xmath44 giving the stability condition , as the last two conditions ( [ e*2_feas ] ) now are trivially satisfied : @xmath45 again a particular case of what we found for ( [ caso2bis ] ) .",
    "for the remaining ones again the routh - hurwitz conditions hold unconditionally .",
    "indeed the remaining ones come from the 2 by 2 submatrix @xmath46 for which the routh - hurwitz conditions hold unconditionally ( [ rh_e1 ] ) .",
    "again , no hopf bifurcation can arise here as well and for @xmath47 there is a transcritical bifurcation for which @xmath48 arises from @xmath32 .    at @xmath48",
    "the characteristic equation is the cubic ( [ char ] ) with coefficients that are obtained from ( [ coeffs ] ) by setting @xmath39 .",
    "therefore since all these coefficients are strictly positive and also the third routh - hurwitz stability condition holds , whenever feasible , the coexistence equilibrium is unconditionally stable .",
    "also , in view of the above strict inequality in ( [ rh_e2 ] ) , no hopf bifurcations can arise here as well .",
    "in this case we assume that the infected prey are harmful for the predators when they come in contact .",
    "the model becomes then @xmath49 again , all the parameter retain their meaning from ( [ caso2bis ] ) , but note the change in sign in the last term of the first equation . once again , the system with the removed singularity becomes @xmath50 , \\\\",

    "we find again the very same condition ( [ e1_2_stab ] ) , as the remaining analysis on the 2 by 2 submatrix carries out unaltered .    at coexistence instead",

    "note that @xmath57 is incompatible with the first feasibility condition for @xmath52 ( [ e*tilde_f1 ] ) .",

    "the analysis shows that the system can not possibly disappear , as the origin is always unstable .",
    "this is a good result in terms of ecological implications , and it is essentially implicit in the model assumptions , namely the logistic growth of the prey , as the positive eigenvalue of the jacobian stems exactly from the susceptible prey reproduction equation .",
