    "soft matter systems driven far from equilibrium by a shear flow manifest striking properties as a result of their sensitivity to external fields  @xcite . for instance , hydrodynamics may either enhance or suppress coarsening processes  @xcite .",
    "coupling with the flow can also lead to the emergence of new , shear - induced phases that are exclusively out - of - equilibrium structures  @xcite , whereas spatiotemporal oscillations and rheochaos are observed in shear - banding systems  @xcite .    despite substantial progress ,",
    "a fundamental understanding of complex fluids under shear remains a challenging question .",
    "the first reason lies in the nature of the coupling between structure and flow . since the local structure of soft materials",
    "is readily reorganized by an external flow , it has in turn a significant impact on the flow itself .",
    "the complexity of this feedback mechanism makes that most theoretical studies are based  to a variable extent  on phenomenological models  @xcite .",
    "the second point is that our understanding of nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) is yet far from complete .",
    "recently , there have been several attempts to construct a unified framework to describe equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena  @xcite . in particular , fluctuations",
    "theorems  @xcite or extended fluctuation - dissipation relations  @xcite have been suggested for complex fluids under shear .",
    "but these relations still remain at the conceptual level and the link with experimental observables ",
    "power spectra , correlation functions  has not been clarified yet .    in this paper , we investigate the statistical properties of a liquid - liquid interface in a stationary flow .",
    "we argue that this system is sophisticated enough to capture the relevant features of ness but remains simple enough to be addressed analytically .",
    "applications of this issue might be expected for instance in microfluidics , since interfacial phenomena are inevitably enhanced as the size of the system is reduced .",
    "still , the question of interface fluctuations under shear has received only little attention so far . from a fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "equilibrium properties of liquid - liquid interfaces are now well established  @xcite , and experimental as well as numerical studies have validated the capillary wave model down to almost molecular scales  @xcite .",
    "this topic has experienced a renewed interest in recent years with the discovery that phase - separated colloid - polymer mixtures may have an extremely low interfacial tension  @xcite .",
    "interface fluctuations can then be analyzed in real time and space using elementary video - microscopy techniques .",
    "the versatility of this method has allowed derks and collaborators to study the statistical properties of an interface exposed to a shear flow  @xcite .",
    "they found that the coupling with the flow leads to a strong reduction of thermal fluctuations , while the correlation length increases .",
    "but this second point is in disagreement with recent monte carlo simulations of a driven ising model  @xcite , therefore raising the fundamental question of what features of interfaces under shear are actually universal .",
    "statistical fluctuations of an interface are driven by the random forces that spontaneously occur in the bulk  @xcite . to describe nonequilibrium properties ,",
    "the main issue is thus to properly account for the coupling between the bulk and the interface .",
    "this can be achieved on the basis of fluctuating hydrodynamics ( fh )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , fh has been successfully applied to various ness situations , and experimental validations have been obtained , e.g. , for fluids in a temperature gradient  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply fh to an interface under shear .",
    "we shall proceed as follow . in sec .",
    "[ fluct ] , we explain how an equation of motion for the interface can be obtained from fh .",
    "we show that the distortion of capillary waves by the flow leads to a mode - coupling equation that is discussed in sec .",
    "this allows us to extract ness properties under a stationary flow in sec .",
    "in particular , we find that the fluctuations are smoothed out by the flow .",
    "the results are then discussed in sec.[disc ] in the light of recent experimental and numerical data available in the literature .",

    "we first set up a hydrodynamic theory to account for the coupling between the surface and the bulk . following the usual hypothesis of capillary wave theory",

    "each phase is characterized by its mass density @xmath4 and its viscosity @xmath5 .",
    "we also define @xmath6 the mean viscosity and @xmath7 the mass density difference .",

    "the capillary length is thus only ten or twenty times larger than the `` microscopic '' cut - off , and it is not clear whether the separation of length scales assumed to get the universal quantities ( @xmath134 , @xmath187 ,  ) is really achieved for this sample .    secondly , monte carlo simulations of smith _ et al .",
    "_ reveals that the average _ width _ of the interface is significantly reduced by the flow  @xcite . in the capillary wave theory",
    ", it is assumed that the density profile behaves like a step function with a strictly vanishing width .",
    "but it is known that physical parameters are directly related to the shape of the _ true _ density profile  @xcite . for instance",
    ", the surface tension is given by @xmath188 with @xmath189 the equilibrium profile and @xmath190 a constant proportional to the second moment of the intermolecular potential  @xcite .",
    "in the small but finite interfacial region , the density is varying rapidly so that the fluids are highly compressible . the density should therefore be modified by the flow and become a function of the applied shear rate @xmath191 .",
    "a plausible consequence is that the bare surface tension might depend on @xmath80 as well . according to eq .",
    "( [ defsigma ] ) , the thinning of the average profile observed in  @xcite is expected to give rise to an increase of the surface tension , and then to an additional reduction of the fluctuations .",

    "\\(i ) we have generalized the hydrodynamic derivation of the dispersion relation to include the effect of an applied shear rate on the dynamics of capillary waves .",
    "( [ mceq ] ) reveals that the system is driven out of equilibrium by an effective shear rate that differs from the applied one .",
    "the mode - coupling structure of the equation also shows that nonequilibrium fluctuations can not be described in terms of a simple renormalization of the interfacial tension .",
    "\\(ii ) the analysis of the mode - coupling equation shows that the fluctuations are smoothed out by the flow , in qualitative agreement with experiments and simulations .",
    "we find that ness fluctuations can be described in terms of a single control parameter defined in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "conclusions regarding the height correlation function are more questionable . if the theory and the simulations predict a decrease of the correlation length in the direction of shear , the reverse is actually observed on the experimental side .",
    "the discrepancies might be due to the finite thickness of the interfacial region and its response to the external flow .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of interfaces under shear should help to clarify this point in a near future .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have derived a hydrodynamic theory to account for the coupling between a shear flow and the fluctuations of an interface .",
    "previous investigations on driven interfaces have revealed partial agreements but also significant discrepancies between experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "although our work brings new insights into the issue , it seems that further investigations will be necessary to definitely reconcile experiment , theory and simulations .",
    "ultimately , achievement of this program should allow to reach a deeper understanding of soft matter systems under shear .",
