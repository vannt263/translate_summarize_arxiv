    "<S> we present an efficient entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for mobile electrons with charge detection . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol is quite different from other ecps for one can obtain a maximally entangled pair from a pair of less - entangled state and a single mobile electron with a certain probability . with the help of charge detection , it can be repeated to reach a higher success probability . </S>",
    "<S> it also does not need to know the coefficient of the original less - entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> all these advantages may make this protocol useful in current distributed quantum information processing .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement plays an important role in the current quantum communication  @xcite and distributed quantum information processing field  @xcite . for most of the practical quantum communication and computation protocols , </S>",
    "<S> people need to share a maximally entangled state with each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , the entanglement resource is fragile , for the maximally entangled state may be degraded into a mixed state or become a less - entangled state when it interacts with the noisy environment . </S>",
    "<S> people usually resort to the entanglement purification  @xcite to increase the fidelity of the mixed state and the entanglement concentration  @xcite which will be detailed here to recover the less - entangled state to a maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> currently , most of the protocols for purification and concentration are focused on optical systems  @xcite , for during the transmission , the photons have weak interaction with the environment .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there is another candidate for the flying qubit , that is the mobile electron . </S>",
    "<S> a strong interaction between different electrons makes them feasible to interact flying electron spins with other solid electron spins , since the coulomb interaction between each electrons is strongly screened . in the recent years </S>",
    "<S> , the investigation about the flying electron qubits becomes an active study area  @xcite . in 2004 , beenakker _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ broke through the obstacle of the no - go theorem with the help of charge detection and constructed a controlled - not(cnot ) gate using beam splitters and spin rotations near deterministically  @xcite . with the help of charge detector </S>",
    "<S> , people can construct the charge qubit  @xcite , perform entanglement purification  @xcite , construct entangled spins  @xcite , and prepare a multipartite entanglement analyzer and cluster states  @xcite . especially , the flying qubit can also be used in the one dimensional system and create entanglement between two distant matter qubits . </S>",
    "<S> recently , matsuzaki and jefferson proposed a protocol for distributed quantum information processing with mobile electrons  @xcite . in their protocol , they used mobile electron spins as the mediators of the interaction between the static qubits at each node and finally created a high quality entanglement between each node . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the distributed quantum entanglement may also be degraded into the less - entangled state when it is coupled with the noisy environment . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , with current technology , it is difficult to operate each flying quibts perfectly , which can also lead the ideal maximally entangled state to be degraded  @xcite .     and reflect spin down @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the charge detector ( c ) can distinguish the charge number 1 from 0 and 2 , but can not distinguish the number 0 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> d is the detector.,width=302 ]    entanglement concentration is a powerful tool to recover a less - entangled state into a maximally entangled one with only local operation and classical communication . </S>",
    "<S> the first entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) was proposed by bennett _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ in 1996  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method is called schmidt projection method , in which they need the collective measurement and need to know the exact coefficient of the initial entangled state . in 2001 , zhao _ et al . _ and yamamoto _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> proposed two similar simplified ecps with linear optical elements based on the schmidt projection method respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both ecps have been realized experimentally  @xcite . in 2009 </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed an ecp based on electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> almost all the current ecps need two pairs of less - entangled states , but after performing each ecp , at most one pair of maximally entangled state can be obtained with a certain success probability .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , using two copies of less - entangled pairs to obtain one maximally entangled pair is not the optimal way . in this paper , we show that we can perform the ecp with the same success probability by using only one pair of less - entangled state and a single electron . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the previous ecps , this protocol requires less less - entangled resources . moreover , analogized with the ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we adopt the charge detectors and polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) to reconstruct our protocol , which makes it have a higher success probability than those protocols with linear optics . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol can also be used to concentrate the multipartite entangled system . </S>",
    "<S> all these advantages may make this protocol more useful in current quantum communication and distributed quantum information processing .    before we start to explain our ecp </S>",
    "<S> , we first introduce the charge detector ( c ) which is a key element shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the charge detector can distinguish the occupation number 1 from the occupation number 0 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can not distinguish between the occupation number 0 and 2  @xcite , so in both two cases , we define the charge detector will show 0 for simple . in fig.1 , we suppose the source @xmath1 emits a pair of less - entangled state of the form    @xmath2 . @xmath3 and @xmath0 are spin up and spin down respectively . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the source @xmath4 emits a single electron to bob of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 and alice only receives one electron from @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> bob first performs a bit - flip operation and makes @xmath8 become @xmath9    then bob lets his two electrons pass through the pbs , which fully transmits @xmath3 and reflects @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 becomes @xmath11    from above equation , one can find that the item @xmath12 means that the two electrons in bob s location are both in the spatial mode @xmath13 while the item @xmath14 means that the two electrons are both in the mode @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , both the items @xmath16 and @xmath17 mean that the two electrons are in the modes @xmath15 and @xmath13 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the charge detector will show 0 if the original state collapses to @xmath12 or @xmath14 , and it will show 1 if the original state collapses to @xmath18    the probability of obtaining the state of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ threephoton ] ) is @xmath19 . obviously , it is the three - electron maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to get a two - electron maximally entangled state from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ threephoton ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> bob needs to perform a hadamard operation on his electron in the mode @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> it makes @xmath20 ) becomes @xmath21\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}[(|\\uparrow\\rangle_{a1}|\\uparrow\\rangle_{c1}+|\\downarrow\\rangle_{a1}|\\downarrow\\rangle_{c1})|\\uparrow\\rangle_{c2}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( |\\uparrow\\rangle_{a1}|\\uparrow\\rangle_{c1}-|\\downarrow\\rangle_{a1}|\\downarrow\\rangle_{c1})|\\downarrow\\rangle_{c2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then the last step for bob is to measure the spin in the basis @xmath22 . from above equation , if the measurement result is @xmath23 , the electron pair in the modes @xmath24 will become @xmath25 , the electron pair in the modes @xmath24 will become @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> if they share the pair @xmath27 , bob will tell alice that the protocol is successful and asks alice to retain her electron . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , they can share a maximally entangled state from a less - entangled state with the success probability of @xmath19 .    from above description , bob chooses the case that the charge detector s result is 1 and discards the case of 0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is essentially the partially parity check gate which picks up the even parity states @xmath28 and @xmath29 but discards the odd parity states @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this case , the function of pbs is similar as it is in the optical systems  @xcite . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , they need to check that both the output modes of the optical pbs contain exactly and only contain one photon . </S>",
    "<S> it is so called the post - selection principle . therefore , even if they successfully perform their ecps , the maximally entangled state would be destroyed by the single photon detector . </S>",
    "<S> the maximally entangled photon pair can not be remained for further application . in this protocol </S>",
    "<S> , bob can judge the successful case from the charge detection results . </S>",
    "<S> the charge qubit carries both the spin degree of freedom and the charge degree of freedom . as charge and spin </S>",
    "<S> are commute and a measurement of charge leaves the spin qubit unaffected , the charge detection does not affect the entangled state of the electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , the charge detector and pbs are more powerful than it has been described above , for the discarded items are essentially the lesser - entangled state which can be reconcentrated in a second step . that is to say , we can not only pick up the even parity states , but also pick up the odd parity states . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we add another pbs say pbs@xmath32 to reconstruct our ecp . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the whole setup p gate shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . if the charge detector s result is 0 , the original state will collapse to @xmath33    it means that after passing through the pbs@xmath34 , both the two electrons are in the same spatial mode , while with the help of pbs@xmath32 , they are coupled into    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     it means that the two electrons in bob s location are in the different spatial modes , say @xmath15 and @xmath13 , respectively . then after performing the hadamard operation and measuring the spin of the electron on the mode @xmath13 , they can get latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    if the measurement result is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> they can get latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    if the measurement result is @xmath0 . both eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ less1 ] ) and ( [ less2 ] ) are lesser - entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> they can be reconcentrated in the next step . briefly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> if they obtain @xmath38 , bob needs to choose another single electron of the form @xmath39 , it becomes @xmath40    obviously , if the charge detection c=1 , they can obtain the same three - electron state as described in eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ threephoton ] ) with a probability of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , if c=0 , the remained state is a lesser - entangled state and can be reconcentrated in a third round . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , they can repeat this protocol to get a higher success probability than other protocols .     </S>",
    "<S> particles in the multipartite ghz state from the source @xmath1 are sent to to @xmath42 parties , say , alice , bob , charlie , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the source @xmath4 also emits a single electron to bob . </S>",
    "<S> the p is the parity check gate shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> it comprises the pbs@xmath34 , charge detector c and pbs@xmath32 . only bob needs to perform this concentration.,width=302 ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to extend this protocol to multi - partite pure entangled state systems . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath42-electron less - entangled system can be described as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    the @xmath42 electrons are emitted from @xmath1 and sent to @xmath42 parties , say , alice , bob , charlie , etc , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> alice gets the electron of number 1 in the spatial mode @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> bob gets number 2 in the spatial mode @xmath44 and charlie gets the number 3 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the source of @xmath4 also emits a single electron to bob with the same form of eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ single ] ) . after rotating it by @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , the composite system can be described as    @xmath46    subsequently , the electrons in the spatial modes @xmath44 and @xmath47 in bob s location pass through the @xmath48 gate . if the charge detector s result is @xmath49 , the eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ multi ] ) will collapse to @xmath50 with the probability of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , bob performs a hardamard operation , and measures the electron in the mode @xmath13 in the basis @xmath51 . if the measurement result is @xmath3 , they will get @xmath52 and if the measurement result is @xmath0 , they will get @xmath53 both eqs . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ multi1 ] ) and (  [ multi2 ] ) are the @xmath42-electron maximally entangled states .    otherwise , if the charge detector s result is @xmath54 , then eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ multi ] ) becomes @xmath55 after performing the hadamard operation and measuring the electron in c2 mode in the @xmath56 basis , the above state becomes @xmath57 compared with eq . </S>",
    "<S> (  [ nparticle ] ) , it is also a multipartite less - entangled state which can be reconcentrated into a maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> + or - is decided by the measurement result @xmath3 or @xmath0 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have fully described our ecp . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare this protocol with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we resort two copies of less - entangled pairs to perform the concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we can get one pair of maximally entangled state with the success probability of @xmath19 . in this protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we use only one pair of less - entangled state and a single electron which can reach the same success probability with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , during the whole protocol , only one - way classical communication is required . </S>",
    "<S> that is alice only needs to receive the information from the bob s measurement and to judge whether the protocol is successful or fail . </S>",
    "<S> if the protocol is a failure , alice needs to do nothing . </S>",
    "<S> if the protocol is successful , bob will tell alice the remaining state is @xmath58 or @xmath59 according to his measurement . in previous protocols  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , all of the parties have to participate the whole procedure , to measure their electrons and check their results to each other to judge the remained state if the protocol is successful . </S>",
    "<S> so this protocol is much more simple , especially when it is used to concentration multi - partite system , for only one of the parties needs to perform the protocol and then report his results to others . finally , let us briefly discuss the key ingredient of this protocol here , that is charge detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been realized in a two - dimensional electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> it was reported that currently achievable time resolution for charge detection is @xmath60  @xcite . in a semiconductor </S>",
    "<S> it was reported that the resolution required for ballistic electrons is less than 5 ps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compared with flying qubit , it may be more practical to use isolated electrons in an array of quantum dots , as pointed by ref .  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed an mobile electron ecp based on charge detection . </S>",
    "<S> compared with other protocols , it has several advantages : first , it dose not require the post - selection principle , and can be repeated to reach a higher efficiency than those based on linear optical elements ; second , only one pair of less - entangled state and one - way classical communication are required , which make this protocol more economic and simple than others . </S>",
    "<S> all these advantages make this ecp more useful in current quantum communication and distributed quantum information processing . </S>"
