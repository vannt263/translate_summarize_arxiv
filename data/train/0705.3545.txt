    "nuclear fusion reaction cross sections and rates are sensitive to the screening effect of the electron cloud around reacting nuclei , an effect that has been widely investigated both theoretically and experimentally since the early works of salpeter @xcite . +",
    "different situations arise when fusion reactions take place : 1 ) in laboratory experiments , where a metal or gaseous target of a given element is bombarded by an ionic or charged particle beam , electrons are for the most part bound in atomic orbits and few of them can be considered free ; 2 ) in stellar cores and other space and astrophysical plasmas where ions and nuclei are embedded in an electronic environment made by mainly free electrons ; 3 ) in a deuterated metal and other solid - state matrices where an impinging deuteron beam reacts with implanted deuterons .",
    " in laboratory experiments , penetration through a screened coulomb potential at center of mass energy @xmath0 is shown to be equivalent to that of bare nuclei at energy @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the atomic radius or the radius of the innermost electrons . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the charges of the two reacting nuclei and @xmath6 is usually taken as constant in the evaluation of cross sections and rates at any energy . very often , at very low energy , fusion cross sections measured in laboratory experiments are higher than the value calculated by means of the usual debye - hckel ( dh ) screening factor",
    ". stopping power of the incoming beam and temperature reached after energy deposition are important quantities for the correct measurement of the cross sections .",
    "modifications of electron distribution can be induced .",
    "the screening effect must be evaluated to obtain the correct astrophysical factor at very low energies @xcite .     in astrophysical plasmas , which that can be considered ideal , the free electrons move around the reacting nuclei and occupy a sphere of dh radius @xmath7 which is taken on the order of @xmath3 , with @xmath8 the particle density and @xmath9 , where the sum is over all positive ions and @xmath10 is the mass fraction of nuclei of type @xmath11 . only with a decreasing radius",
    "does the screening effect become important .",
    "a screening factor of the rate can be derived when the energy of the gamow peak @xmath12 .",
    "it is given by the debye factor @xmath13 with , this time , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been clarified through numerous experimental observations that the velocity distribution function of electrons ( and possibly also of ions ) in stellar atmospheres , in space and astrophysical plasmas , may deviate from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution in the high - energy tail if non - local thermodynamic effects are non - negligible @xcite .",
    "in stellar atmospheres , atomic processes such as radiative and dielectronic recombination show rates depending on deviations from maxwellian distributions of electrons @xcite . in stellar cores , signals of possible deviations of ion distributions are evident and , although small , should be considered because they are capable of sensibly influencing nuclear fusion reaction rates @xcite .",
    " in deuterated metals or solid - state matter , the strong screening effect has still to be clearly understood and discussed , although a few interesting descriptions have recently been brought forward to reproduce experimental results @xcite .",
    "the approach we are discussing here is very useful in understanding the fusion rates in this matter which could simulate some high - density astrophysical plasmas .",
    "however , this application deserves a separate detailed paper and we will not discuss this case here .",
    "an important issue in the shielding of electrostatic potential in plasmas concerns the investigation of non - linear charge screening effects that can induce modifications in the dh potential , usually derived by linearizing the poisson equation @xcite .",
    "one of the first studies which , on a microscopic basis , demonstrated deviations from dh factor can be found in @xcite . [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "the different approaches elaborated up to now are based on the assumption that electrons are distributed in space according to a boltzmann factor .",
    "few authors @xcite have assumed a stationary @xmath15-lorentz distribution to describe significant deviations from standard distributions , constructed from experimental distributions , due to the presence of enhanced high - energy tails . in a recent reference @xcite , for instance",
    ", we can find quotations from many works where such distributions are reported . by analyzing energy profiles the authors derive an effective length smaller than the standard dh radius , depending on the @xmath15-parameter .",
    "this result is obtained by solving a poisson equation in the linear weak approximation .",
    "the consequence must be an increased barrier penetration factor .",
    "our approach differs .",
    "we assume that the electron cloud is spatially distributed following a generalized steady state distribution of the @xmath16-type that reduces to an exponential distribution when the @xmath16 parameter ( also known as the tsallis entropic parameter ) approaches the @xmath17 limit @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of tsallis generalized statistics and some of its applications to astrophysical problems .",
    "we then calculate the modified screening potential by considering two different approaches .",
    "one concerns the use of a generalized poisson equation or bernoulli equation as used by @xcite ; the other is based on super - statistics @xcite considering fluctuations of an intensive parameter ( the inverse of the dh radius ) .",
    "this implies fluctuation in temperature and density of the components of the plasma .",
    "once we obtain the modified potential , we calculate penetration probability through that potential . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the value range @xmath18 ( distribution in spatial coordinates with depleted tail cut at about @xmath19 ) , leaving the case @xmath20 that describes a distribution in space coordinates with enhanced long - distance .    in the standard dh shielding approach , after linearization of the poisson equation , the electrostatic screened potential behaves like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coordinate with which to evaluate the dh potential .",
    "the assumptions made to derive the above relation are , among others things , that @xcite : plasmas are collisionless ; the induced perturbation is slow and depends slowly on time ( slowness ) ; only electrostatic fields are present while induced fields are negligible ; temperature is spatially uniform and the plasma remains in equilibrium during a perturbation ; a temperature can always be defined ; the number of particles inside the dh sphere is large and therefore fluctuations are small ; although ions and electrons have a random thermal motion , perturbations induced around the equilibrium , responsible for small spatial variations of electrostatic potential , can be neglected .",
    "of course , if the real situation differs from the one imposed by one or more of the assumptions reported above , the use of dh potential may induce errors in the evaluation of the penetration factor and nuclear reaction rates .",
    "+ deviations from the conditions imposed by the assumptions are taken into account in this work by choosing the inverse of dh length @xmath23 as a fluctuating parameter .",
    "+ the electrostatic quantity @xmath24 is asymptotically given , in this case , by a power law instead of an exponential law because it must satisfy a differential equation , the bernoulli equation ( or a special case of it ) , that has power law functions as solutions .",
    "+ we can derive the modified dh potential @xmath25 and , a posteriori , the charge distribution @xmath26 as an asymptotically power law function .",
    "also in the standard dh approach also two equations are needed , one coming from electromagnetism ( poisson equation ) , the other from statistical mechanics ( boltzmann factor ) .",
    "+ penetration factor @xmath27 can be calculated by means of the wkb approach using the modified dh potential .",
    "we obtain results that differ from the ones calculated with standard dh potential and that will be useful in the interpretation of experimental results on atomic and nuclear rates in several astrophysical systems and processes .",
    "we also derive equivalent energy @xmath28 that we give by an interpolating analytical expression , a plot and a tabulation . energy @xmath28 results a function of the variable @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath28 depends , for a wide range of values of @xmath29 , on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in section 2 ,",
    "we explain how to derive the modified potential on the basis of super - statistics arguments with the inverse dh length as a fluctuating parameter ; we then introduce a nonlinear differential equation , to be associated with the poisson equation , whose solution coincides with the potential derived directly from the super - statistics approach .",
    "+ in section 3 , we derive the penetration factor that can be used for evaluation of nuclear fusion rates in astrophysical plasmas and indicate the range of validity of approximations adopted . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss some representative examples whilst , in section 5 , we report our conclusions .",
    "combining the gauss law and the relation that links the electrostatic field to the electric potential @xmath34 of a point test unitary charge at the origin in a vacuum , from the poisson equation one obtains the pure coulomb potential . after a sufficiently long time ,",
    "electrons and ions rearrange themselves as a response to the forces on them .",
    "ion density eventually remains uniform while electron density near the test charge increases . at the new thermal equilibrium",
    ", the distribution of electrons in an electrostatic field is assumed to be given by the well - known boltzmann factor . assuming the boltzmann factor for all the particles , after linearization and using neutrality condition , the poisson equation can be written as @xmath35 with solution given by the dh potential and the charge density @xmath36 expressed as @xmath37 when one or more of the linearity constraints are violated or relaxed , a different description of the screening is required .",
    "if we assume that nonlinear effects produce fluctuations on the inverse dh radius , by following the approach usually developed by super - statistics for inverse temperature @xmath38 @xcite , we can describe the plasma around the test charge as made of cells where @xmath39 is approximately constant and the system can be described by ordinary statistical mechanics , in this case by the exponential ( boltzmann ) factor @xmath40 . in the long term",
    "run the system is described by a spatial average over the mean of fluctuating quantity @xmath23 .",
    "fluctuation of the inverse dh radius also means fluctuation of the plasma parameter given by @xmath41    with few changes , we follow the approach by wilk and wodarczyk for the case of distributions with depleted tails ( @xmath42 ) @xcite . here",
    "we focus our attention on @xmath42 distribution because this shows a depleted tail with a cut - off , that is , the spatial distribution we assume for the electrons .",
    "+ we assume that a certain variable @xmath22 of the system is limited between @xmath43 and @xmath44^{-1}$ ] where @xmath45 is a constant parameter . + we define the function @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalization factor and @xmath48 is the probability density to observe a certain value @xmath49 of the system which is spread around the value @xmath45 . the expression we choose for @xmath48 is a gamma distribution @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath16 is the entropic tsallis parameter . + inserting the function @xmath48 into @xmath52 we obtain the normalized power law distribution @xmath53 average value and variance of @xmath49 depend on variable @xmath22 according to @xmath54 ^ 2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 is evaluated by means of distribution @xmath48 .",
    "+ however , the relative variance depends only on @xmath16 @xmath56 we remark that quantity @xmath45 coincides with the spatial average of @xmath57 , that is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is evaluated by means of distribution @xmath52 which is the weighted average of the exponential ( or boltzmann - like ) factor @xmath60 with weight equal to @xmath48 and coincides with the laplace transform of @xmath48 . + some special limiting cases are @xmath61 and @xmath62 the ordinary boltzmann - like factor , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 a linear function , with @xmath67 .",
    "+ let us now identify functional @xmath52 with quantity @xmath68 and substitute @xmath49 with @xmath23 , so that @xmath69 coincides with the spatial average of the dh radius fluctuation . by posing @xmath70 a characteristic length of the system under inspection which reduces to @xmath39 in the @xmath17 limit , we obtain the following expression @xmath71 which , for @xmath17 reduces to the standard dh potential .",
    "we also have charge distribution @xmath72 which for @xmath17 reduces to @xmath36 , the charge distribution of the dh approximation .",
    "+ therefore , by considering @xmath23 subject to fluctuations described by a gamma distribution , quantity @xmath24 related to the potential energy barrier is modified from the exponential dh expression to a power - like law , typical of generalized @xmath42 distribution .",
    "when we can establish the functional relation between density @xmath8 and temperature @xmath73 , as , for instance in a solar - like star , where quantity @xmath74 is constant along the star profile @xcite , by means of the relative variance we can establish a link between inverse dh radius and temperature fluctuations and parameter @xmath16 through @xmath75 diffusion of matter between layers with different temperatures induces local temperature fluctuations and density perturbations ; fluctuations around an equilibrium or a steady - state matter profile induce fluctuations of quantity @xmath23 in the dh sphere , particularly in the regions where the number of particles inside the dh sphere is small .",
    "density and temperature fluctuations do not alter the macroscopic plasma parameters and must agree with the requirements of the constraints imposed by the macroscopic observations . in the solar interior , @xcite have evaluated that the dh radius is about @xmath76 , therefore containing a small number of particles with a corresponding non - negligible particle fluctuation .",
    "let us now justify expressions ( [ qpot ] ) and ( [ qcharge ] ) by means of another approach that considers a generalized version of the poisson equation .",
    "in fact , in the standard case , the dh potential can be obtained from the solution of the second order differential equation of the type @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "+ we replace the above linear equation with the following one @xmath79 with @xmath80^{1\\over1-q } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a real number parameter and coincides with the tsallis parameter . for @xmath17",

    "( [ qpot ] ) .",
