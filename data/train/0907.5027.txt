    "<S> the electrodes are built in the same material framework . </S>",
    "<S> this way one is able to select the spin of the electrons flowing through the system without the need to resort to heterojunctions or multilayered materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic properties of systems such as carbon nanotubes and graphene can be altered by the introduction of impurities , enhancing even more their potential for applications.@xcite a possible candidate that presents a combination of both low formation energy and significant changes to the transport properties of gnrbs is substitutional boron.@xcite boron in carbon nanotubes and graphite have already been reported@xcite and there are suggestions of small spin polarization in singly doped gnrbs.@xcite    there are other proposals of spin - filtering effects in the literature related mostly to the nanoribbon edge termination ranging from different end - groups@xcite to different orientations in the same gnrb.@xcite however none of which present 100% spin - filtering . moreover - and most importantly - although significant level of control has been achieved in creating ever smoother lateral edges via chemical processes,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> it is highly unlikely that one will be able to assemble a device with a single impurity atom - or a few impurities placed in carefully chosen positions - at an industrial scale . </S>",
    "<S> as it is usually the case , the presence of disorder would seemingly have a detrimental effect over the degree of polarization of the system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one raises the fundamental question of whether conductance polarization would survive in the presence of a large number of defects randomly distributed along a one - dimensional system up to 0.5 @xmath0 in length in what would be considered a more realistic setup .    although computer simulations can help determine the behavior of nanoscopic devices , up until now atomistic _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ predictions that can be directly related to experiments in this length scale had been hindered by the shear size of the calculation - up to 40,000 atoms - required to answer the question posed above . in this work , combining _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft)@xcite with recursive non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf)@xcite techniques for calculating electronic transport , we propose a true spin filter based on realistic b - doped graphene nanoribbons with up to 450 nm in length . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for boron as a point in case in what is a much more general effect . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in disordered systems the current can reach 100% spin polarization even if the electrons entering the device are not spin polarized at all , provided there is a spin - asymmetry in the single scatterer transmission probabilities . </S>",

    "<S> each of the three types of building blocks used in our calculations are shown . </S>",
    "<S> color code : h - white , c - grey , and b - light red.,width=302 ]    initially we performed dft calculations on graphene nanoribbons of different widths with one substitutional boron atom . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> 9 irreducible cells for a graphene nanoribbon were used . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were performed using the siesta code.@xcite our calculations show that the formation energy of substitutional boron at the edges of the nanoribbon is smaller than any other site by at least @xmath1.@xcite furthermore , our calculations also indicate that b atoms do not clusterize to the extent that two borons prefer to stay as far apart as possible as to remain non - interacting . </S>",
    "<S> hence in all calculations presented hereafter we assume that the b atoms are positioned at either edges of the ribbon . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of a zig - zag pristine carbon nanoribbon presents ferromagnetic coupling between atoms of the same edge whereas the ordering is anti - ferromagnetic between the two edges . </S>",
    "<S> it has been noted , however , that the energy differences between the lowest energy solution and the fully ferromagnetically oriented gnrb is relatively small ( approximately 11 mev per edge atom ) in which case at room temperature the edges are decoupled and a small magnetic field could be applied simply to align the magnetic moments of the pristine nanoribbon without significantly affecting the electronic structure of the system . in all calculations shown here </S>",
    "<S> we use the fully ferromagnetic solution since it gives rise to a metallic state and would keep the magnetic moments fully aligned even at room temperature.@xcite        from our results we look at the changes in the electronic structure of nanoribbons caused by the presence of boron impurities . in figure [ chargemagmoment](a - c ) </S>",
    "<S> we show the difference in charge density @xmath2 calculated with dft between a pristine nanoribbon and one with substitutional boron . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , for a narrow gnrbs the introduction of the impurity leads to changes in the charge density that are localized along the device , but that spill onto the border opposite to the defect . </S>",
    "<S> as we make the system wider - going from a ( 3,0 ) to a ( 5,0 ) and finally to a ( 7,0 ) gnrb - the changes in charge density quickly localize around the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> finally one can clearly see that the magnetic moment ( @xmath3 ) at the edges close to the b atom goes to zero ( figure [ chargemagmoment](d - f ) ) due to the empty @xmath4 orbital for both spins .    </S>",
    "<S> we initially consider one segment of a ( 3,0 ) gnrb containing a single boron impurity - as seen in figure [ chargemagmoment]a - coupled to two semi - infinite pristine nanoribbons to either side acting as charge reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> we use standard negf formalism coupled to dft.@xcite figure [ transmission ] shows the transmission for majority and minority spins for both a pristine gnrb and one with a single boron impurity . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that total transmission results for the single impurity case at the fermi level , @xmath5 are 0.67 and 0.82 for majority and minority spins respectively . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the spin filtering effects </S>",
    "<S> . one important measure of a device s capability to act as a spin filter is the degree of polarization @xmath6 defined here as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spin dependent ( @xmath9 ) total conductance @xmath10 normalized by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the conductance polarization for the single impurity case is approximately -10% , similar to what has been reported in earlier works.@xcite    one important point that must be noted here is that , although one might say that the pristine system is ferromagnetic , at @xmath5 the polarization of the current is exactly zero . </S>",
    "<S> hence , deep inside the leads the current is not spin - polarized at all , and the total transmission is equal to 1 for both spin channels thus justifying our choice of electrodes .        we then set out to simulate a more realistic device where boron is incorporated at random along the gnrbs . in order to do </S>",
    "<S> so we use a combination of dft and recursive green s function methods.@xcite our device is modeled by dividing a long system into segments ( as shown in figure [ chargemagmoment]g ) consisting of regions with impurities - in this case the two different edges of the nanoribbon where the b atom can be positioned - and pieces of the pristine graphene nanoribbon . </S>",
    "<S> a segment of the gnrb highlighting the building blocks ( indexes @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) of our device is depicted in figure [ chargemagmoment]g . </S>",
    "<S> we can clearly see that the distance between two b atoms may vary as well as the edge where it is placed .    in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we have considered different defect concentrations per mass ( obtained by changing the number of scattering sites containing boron ) ranging from approximately @xmath15 down to @xmath16 ; the length of the ribobns were varied up to @xmath17 and the temperature ranged from 300 down to 3 k.    in figure [ fig03](a - b ) we present spin - resolved conductance calculations as a function of the length @xmath18 of the nanoribbon . </S>",
    "<S> each curve represents a different number of scattering sites @xmath19 ( the defect concentration for each curve decreases as we increase the length ) . </S>",
    "<S> two important aspects can be noticed from this curve . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is that , after a characteristic length the conductance for both majority and minority spins saturates . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation of the conductance can be understood in terms of anderson localization . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that , besides the well known exponential dependence of the conductance on the length of the device , @xmath20,@xcite the localization length @xmath21 is inversely proportional to the concentration of scatterers , @xmath22 along the nanoribbon.@xcite hence , simple algebra shows that , for a fixed number of scattering centers , one would expect the conductance to be independent of the length of the system when we are in the localized regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the second feature however is also the most striking one . from figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03]c we note that the degree of spin polarization , @xmath6 increases with the number of defects until the current becomes essentially 100% spin polarized when the number of scattering centers is of the order of 100 for a range of concentrations and gnrb lengths . </S>",
    "<S> thus , remarkably , the presence of random disorder has not only preserved the conductance polarization , but in reality has led to an enhancement of the spin filtering effect until majority spins are completely blocked .    </S>",
    "<S> this , in principle , seems counter - intuitive . in order to understand this behavior </S>",
    "<S> we look into the characteristic length of our device , namely the localization length . in figure [ fig04 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the average of the natural logarithm of the normalized conductance for each spin channel as a function of system length . for all defect concentrations </S>",
    "<S> shown we can clearly see that the points fall nicely into a straight line as predicted by anderson for the localized regime.@xcite the main point here is that one obtains different localization lengths for each spin channel in such a manner that the ratio @xmath23 ranges between 0.51 - 0.29 depending on the concentration of defects . with the ratio between the minority and majority localization lengths being approximately two </S>",
    "<S> , this means that @xmath24 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> an increase in the length of the device such that the spin down conductance decreases by a factor of ten implies that the spin up conductance decreases much faster , by a factor of one hundred .        the mechanism for this spin filtering effect can be traced back to scaling theory of localization.@xcite there one can relate the conductance at a certain impurity concentration to the resistance of a single scattering site and to the mean free path , @xmath25 . in turn , the mean free path can be directly associated , using thouless relation,@xcite to the localization length . for </S>",
    "<S> our particular case of a gnrb one would find that , at a fixed concentration and zero temperature , the ratio between the spin - dependent localization lengths would be equal to the inverse ratio between the single impurity resistances for each spin channel , @xmath26 . for a single impurity in the specific case of a gnrb </S>",
    "<S> the resistance can be approximated by @xmath27 , where one has to remove the contact resistance @xmath28 for each spin . from figure [ transmission ] we can estimate the value of @xmath29 as 0.45 . since this relation is only valid at t=0 we performed calculations at low temperatures ( t = 3 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in figure [ fig04]d show that the localization length changes considerably as we lower the temperature although the curves retain the straight - line character that characterizes the localization regime.@xcite in the low temperature regime we obtain a value of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in excellent agreement with our predictions for the single impurity case , thus unequivocally demonstrating that this effect is indeed disorder - driven , but most importantly that it can be inferred from single impurity scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , from figure [ fig04]e , we also observe that the conductance polarization is resilient to changes in temperature even if @xmath31 changes considerably . </S>",
    "<S> finally one might argue that ( 3,0 ) gnrbs are quite narrow and the effect seen in figure [ chargemagmoment]a - where the charge density differences due to the boron impurity on one edge of the gnrb spills onto the opposite border - could have significant influence over our conclusions . for ( 5,0 ) and ( 7,0 ) </S>",
    "<S> nanoribbons which are already within state of the art experimental range,@xcite changes to the density ( as seen in figure [ chargemagmoment](b - c ) ) are confined to only one side . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been shown that the degree of polarization of a single b impurity significantly decreases as a function of gnrb width.@xcite we observe from figure [ fig04]f , however , that for the same concentration of defects the degree of polarization is still very high .    as a final remark the resistance measurements required to obtain a polarization close to @xmath32 would be of the order of 100 m@xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that one could easily obtain values of @xmath6 between @xmath34 already in the @xmath35 regime with approximately 25 impurities . </S>",
    "<S> this range could be easily achieved by today s experimental apparatus.@xcite    in conclusion , we have proposed a device that presents perfect spin - filtering capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on b - doped graphene nanoribbons that not only retain conductance polarization in the presence of defects , but we observe a staggering increase reaching up to 100% spin filtering . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was explained in terms of different scattering probabilities at the impurity site for majority and minority spins which consequently leads to different localization lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential dependence of the conductance on the localization length thus results in changes in resistance that are significant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have proposed a device based on the realistic assumption that impurities are present in an uncontrolled manner . </S>",
    "<S> these impurities in fact drive the spin selectivity of the system with the added bonus that one does not need to rely on a spin valve based on multilayered materials and interface problems can be largely ignored . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that no assumptions about the specific nature of the defect were necessary in our scaling model for the localization length . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although we have shown a proof - of - concept using boron scatterers one would expect a similar behavior with different scattering centers provided the spin degeneracy of the scattering probability is broken . </S>",
    "<S> finally the results shown here might have important technological implications since it might lead to a new family of electronic devices where one can select the spin of the electron and consequently make a realistic spintronics device . </S>"
