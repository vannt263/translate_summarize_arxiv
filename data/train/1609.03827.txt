    "heat conduction by phonons is a fundamental physical process with great relevance in numerous problems in science and engineering as well as in technological applications @xcite . in the context of macroscale systems ,",
    "phonon conduction is , to some extent , well understood thanks to the use of semiclassical theoretical methods such as the boltzmann transport equation @xcite or molecular - dynamics - based approaches @xcite , which are often used in combination with ab - initio techniques for the determination of the phonon spectra and coupling constants .",
    "however , with the advent of novel nanoscale systems and devices it has become possible to study phonon conduction in a new regime , where the system size can be smaller than the inelastic mean free path for phonons ( due to phonon - phonon interactions ) , and in some cases even smaller than the corresponding elastic mean free path leading to quasi - ballistic transport @xcite . in this new regime",
    ", phonon conduction has to be described by purely quantum mechanical means , which poses a very interesting and challenging problem for the theory .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the heat conduction via phonons in single - molecule junctions , which constitute the ultimate limit of miniaturization of electronic devices .",
    "these nanojunctions have emerged in recent years as ideal platforms to study the quantum theories that describe both the charge and energy transport in nanoscale devices @xcite . in particular , recent experimental advances have made it possible to investigate different aspects of energy and heat conduction in molecular junctions such as thermoelectricity @xcite , joule heating @xcite , and thermal conductance @xcite .",
    "these advances stimulate the development of fully ab - initio methods , which in turn should elucidate the main aspects and physical mechanisms of phonon conduction in atomic - scale junctions . in this sense ,",
    "the goal of this paper is to use an ab - initio approach , based on a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) and non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) techniques , to study one of the most fundamental questions in the context of phonon transport in atomic - scale systems , namely the length dependence of the thermal conductance of a molecular chain .",
    "the theoretical discussion of the thermal conductance of a linear one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain has a long history @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that in long ideal chains ( of more than 100 identical units ) exhibiting nonlinear interactions , momentum conservation and no disorder , the thermal conductance decays algebraically as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the chain length and the exponent @xmath2 is found to be @xmath3 . although these results are of fundamental interest , it is not clear that they are very relevant for actual experiments on nanoscale systems due to the long chain lengths required .    in the context of molecular junctions , the issue of the length dependence of the thermal conductance has already been addressed both experimentally and theoretically",
    ". often the molecules of choice have been alkane chains @xcite , which are saturated molecules , whose electrical properties have been widely studied in the context of molecular electronics @xcite . from the experimental side ,",

    "@xcite , using a diffusive transport model combined with hartree - fock calculations of the vibrational modes of alkane chains , suggested that the thermal conductance should be fairly length - independent for chains with more than 5 ch@xmath4 units . in the only ab - initio study of this issue that we are aware of , sadeghi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite explored the phonon transport in alkane - based single - molecule junctions with 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 ch@xmath4 units and found a very pronounced decay of the thermal conductance for the longest molecular length .",

    "making use of a combination of dft and negf techniques , we analyze the thermal conductance of au - alkane - au molecular junctions as a function of the length of the alkane chains ranging from 2 to 30 methylene units .",
    "moreover , in order to elucidate the role of the metal - molecule interface , we investigate two different anchoring groups , namely thiol ( sh ) and amine ( nh@xmath4 ) .",

    "the ensemble of our results shows that the room - temperature phonon thermal conductance of all investigated junctions is fairly length - independent for chains with more than 5 ch@xmath4 units .",
    "this statement also holds for the total thermal conductance that consists of phononic and electronic contributions , since we show that the electronic contribution plays a significant role only for the shortest chain lengths below 4 units . moreover ,",
    "we demonstrate that the relative efficiency of the phonon heat conduction is mainly , although not exclusively , dictated by the strength of the metal - molecule phononic coupling .",

    "the first step in our modeling is the construction of the molecular junction geometries .",
    "we use dft to compute equilibrium geometries through total energy minimization and to describe their electronic structure .",

    "we also investigate the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance . in this way we can assess the relative importance of electrons and phonons in the studied molecular junctions .",

    "to investigate the length dependence of the thermal conductance of single - molecule junctions , we study alkanes chains of different length with an even number @xmath53 of methylene ( ch@xmath4 ) units ranging between 2 and 30",
    ". these saturated molecules are electrically rather insulating , which ensures that the thermal transport is dominated by phonons ( see below ) . to elucidate the role of the anchoring or terminal group in the length dependence of the phonon transport ,",

    "moreover , in order to establish a meaningful comparison between the different compounds , special care was taken to avoid both strain effects and the appearance of defects in the molecular chains . in this sense , the alkane chains remain linear in our case , while the introduction of f atoms causes the carbon atoms to deviate from this linear structure , leading to more disordered ptfe chains .",

    "the electrodes are made of gold and the contact geometries are such that molecules are bonded to the electrodes in an atop position via the anchoring groups . ]",
    "we summarize in fig .",
    "[ fig - kph ] the main result of this work , namely the room - temperature phononic thermal conductance for the four types of molecular junctions as a function of the number of c@xmath54 segments ( @xmath57 ) ranging from 2 to 30 , which corresponds to a maximum length of around 4.5 nm .",
    "the first thing to mention is that the conductance values range from 15 to 45 pw / k .",
    "second , for chains with more than 5 segments the conductance exhibits small variations , but it is basically length - independent , irrespective of the molecular family .",
    "third , the molecules with amine anchoring groups typically exhibit a lower conductance than the corresponding dithiolated ones .",
    "this is particularly evident in the case of the ptfe - diamine molecules , which exhibit thermal conductances that are about a factor of 2 smaller than those of the other families .",
    "overall , these results show that the phononic thermal conductance of alkane - based single - molecule junctions is rather insensitive to the molecular length for up to 30 segments , which is a signature of ballistic phonon transport .",
    "k ) phonon thermal conductance as a function of the number of c@xmath54 units ( @xmath57 ) in the molecule for both anchoring groups , thiol and amine .",
    "the distance between neighboring c atoms in the chains of around 1.5    allows to translate the number of units to a corresponding distance . ]    to understand these results , let us first analyze the energy dependence of the phonon transmission .",
    "an example for the four types of molecules with @xmath58 c@xmath54 segments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tph ] .",
    "first of all , notice that the transmission is different from zero only in an energy region between 0 and 20 mev , which is determined by the phonon density of states of the gold electrodes ( see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "second , the most obvious feature in these results is the fact that for the molecules with the amine group the transmission spectra exhibit narrower peaks , which explains the lower conductance obtained for these molecules .",
    "( this is particularly well pronounced for the ptfe - diamine ones . )",
    "this strongly suggests that the phononic metal - molecule coupling for the amine group is weaker than for thiol . on the other hand , although the fluorinated molecules are expected to exhibit more vibrational modes in the transport window than the alkane chains due to the larger mass of the f atoms , one does not observe significant differences .",
    "to further clarify how the elastic phonon transport takes place , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig - taun ] the largest individual phonon transmission coefficients for molecular junctions with alkanedithiols of three different lengths ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 methylene units ) .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the total transmission is dominated by a single or two phonon channels , with a third one giving only a small contribution .",
    "the number of channels is controlled in this case by the rather linear molecules , and the three channels correspond to the three polarizations of the vibrational modes .",
    "it is important to realize that this number of channels can not be altered by the number of vibrational modes in the molecular chains , which only determine the actual values of the transmission coefficients . more important for our discussion of the length dependence",
    "is the fact that the dominant channel is fully open ( transmission equal to 1 ) over a wide range of energies , irrespective of the length of the molecule .",
    "this is indeed the true signature of ballistic phonon transport , which is realized here with alkane and alkane - related molecular chains .     units . ]        to gain further insight into our ab - initio results , we have developed a simple 1d model that is schematically represented in fig .  [ fig-1dmodel](a ) . in the following we will use the notation @xmath61 for elements of the dynamical matrix coupling atoms @xmath24 and @xmath62 in the toy model as compared to @xmath63 in the full ab - initio results",
    ". in the model we consider only nearest - neighbor couplings between segments in the molecular chain , @xmath64 , and the leads are modeled as 1d au chains with an analogous nearest - neighbor coupling , @xmath65 .",
    "finally , the metal - molecule coupling is described by a single constant , @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "we extracted these parameters from the dft calculations as the highest eigenvalue of @xmath63 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq - kmatrix ] ) .",
    "these parameters depend on the molecular species , but not on the molecular length , and we summarize their values in table [ table ] .",
    ".parameters for the 1d model schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig-1dmodel](a ) .",
    "all elements @xmath61 of the dynamical matrix are given in units of mev@xmath68 .",
    "notice that the same value of @xmath65 was used in all cases .",
    "[ table ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using these parameters , we computed the corresponding thermal conductance with the green s function method described in section [ sec - methods ] and the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig-1dmodel](b ) . as one can see , this simple model is able to reproduce all the salient features of our ab - initio results in fig .",
    "[ fig - kph ] .",
    "in particular , it nicely reproduces the fact that the amine - terminated molecules exhibit a lower thermal conductance , which is especially evident in the case of the ptfe - diamine chains .",
    "now we can confirm that this lower thermal conductance is due to a weaker coupling to the leads ( see values of @xmath69 in table  [ table ] ) .",
    "the strongly reduced coupling for ptfe - diamine chains as compared to their alkane - diamine counterparts results in practice from the larger distance ( about 0.15  ) between the au electrodes and the n atoms in these molecular junctions .",
    "let us also mention that we attribute the higher conductance values obtained with the 1d model as compared to the ab - initio results to the fact that we extract the parameters @xmath61 from the largest eigenvalues of the dynamical submatrices @xmath63 .",
    "units ( @xmath57 ) in the molecule for both anchoring groups , thiol and amine . ]",
    "so far we have focused on the phononic contribution to the thermal conductance and one may wonder whether the electrons play any role .",
    "alkanes are known to be poor electrical conductors @xcite .",
    "thus , on the basis of the wiedemann - franz law @xcite , one therefore does not expect the electrons to give a significant contribution to the thermal conductance . to check this ,",
    "we have studied the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance , @xmath70 , in all of our molecular junctions using the ab - initio methodology briefly described in subsection [ sec - methods].c . using @xmath71  k , we show in fig .  [ fig - ratio ] the results for the ratio between the electronic and phononic thermal conductances as a function of the molecular length for the four families of molecules investigated here .",
    "as one can see , when molecular chains have more than 4 segments , the electronic contribution is negligible .",
    "notice that the exponential decay of the conductance ratio is a simple consequence of the exponential decay of the electrical conductance with length in the off - resonant transport situation .",
    "it follows from the proportionality of @xmath70 and the electrical conductance and a rather length - independent @xmath72 .    ) and phononic ( @xmath72 ) room - temperature thermal conductance as a function of the molecular length for the 4 different types of molecules studied in this work . in the inset the thermal conductance due to both electronic and phononic contributions",
    "is displayed for short chain lengths . ]    in the previous section we discussed the results for the thermal conductance at room temperature . for completeness",
    ", we now briefly address the issue of the temperature dependence of the phonon transport .",
    "[ fig - tdep ] displays the temperature dependence from 0 to 300 k of the phonon thermal conductance for junctions with the four molecular species and featuring @xmath58 c@xmath54 segments .",
    "this temperature dependence is relatively insensitive to the molecular length and thus , the results of fig .  [ fig - tdep ] are representative of the four molecular species studied in this work . as one can see , the thermal conductance raises abruptly at low temperatures , it tends to saturate , depending on the molecule , above approximately 100 to 200 k , and around room temperature it is fairly constant .",
    "this overall behavior simply reflects the fact that for temperatures above the debye temperature of gold , all the phonons of the metal electrodes as well as the vibrational modes of the molecule with energies within the transport window are thermally occupied , while below this temperature the higher - lying modes are only partially occupied and the thermal conductance hence becomes sensitive to the temperature .     units . ]",
    "let us now discuss the comparison with existent results . from the theory side our results , showing a thermal conductance relatively insensitive of the molecular length , are qualitatively compatible with the findings of segal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for weakly coupled alkane chains .",
    "this is also the case for the results of duda _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our results are also in agreement with the molecular dynamics calculations performed by luo and lloyd @xcite , which studied octanedithiol sams sandwiched between gold electrodes and estimated a thermal conductance per molecule of 43 pw / k . however , our results are clearly at variance with the strong decay for the longest molecule reported by sadeghi _",
    "@xcite , which indeed is the only ab - initio study published to date on the length dependence of the thermal conductance of alkane single - molecule junctions .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is unclear to us , but it is worth pointing out that those authors only analyzed a very limited number of molecules ( with 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 methylene units ) and they used a different anchoring group ( hydrobenzothiophene ) .    with respect to existent experiments on the length dependence , we can not establish a direct comparison , but our length independence is compatible with the experiments of wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in junctions based on alkanedithiol sams sandwiched between au and gaas electrodes . on the other hand , the experiments of meier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which represent the most systematic study of the length dependence of the thermal conductance of alkane junctions to date , exhibit some basic differences with the junctions studied in this work .",
    "first , the tip electrode was made of si .",
    "second , the alkanes were monothiolated .",
    "third , the temperature difference used in the experiment was between 200 and 300 @xmath73c , which is most likely beyond the linear response regime addressed in our work . finally , in this experiment the number of contacted molecules is not directly determined , and it is only inferred with the help of tip models .",
    "having said all that , let us mention that the estimated conductance values per molecule lie in the range of our calculated values and a careful inspection of the experimental data shows that the conductance is indeed fairly independent of the molecular length for chains with more than 8 methylene units . anyway , a rigorous comparison with experiment to settle the issue of the length dependence of the thermal conductance requires true single - molecule experimental techniques , and our results provide clear predictions that we hope will be tested experimentally in the near future .",
    "related to the role of the anchoring group , let us mention that losego _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated experimentally with the time - domain thermoreflectance technique its impact on heat transport in sams of alkanes contacted to quartz and gold films .",
    "they observed that the replacement of amines as the binding group to the au film by thiols led to a 60% increase of the thermal conductance per unit area for chains with 11 methylene units .",
    "this is consistent with the general trend found here in the sense that the amine - terminated molecules exhibit in general a lower thermal conductance than their thiolated counterparts .",
    "let us conclude this section by stressing that in spite of the fact that we are using an approach , where anharmonic effects are not taken into account , the finding of a length - independent thermal conductance , as reported , here is by no means trivial .",
    "the intrinsic disorder in the molecular chains , which is present e.g.  in the ptfe chains , can in principle lead to a diffusive transport regime , where the conductance decays linearly with length , or ultimately to an anderson - localized regime , where the conductance is exponentially suppressed with length . in our study",
    "we see that for chains of up to 30 segments ( with a length of up to 4.5 nm ) the conductance exhibits a weak length dependence , indicating that the elastic mean free path is larger than the system size",
    ". it would be interesting to study the limits of this quasi - ballistic transport , and we hope to address this issue in the near future .",
    "let us also emphasize that segal _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that anharmonicity in the alkane chains is rather weak and it is not expected to play a crucial role in the range of lengths studied in this work .",
    "therefore , our approach is well justified .",
    "in summary , we have presented a systematic ab - initio study of the length dependence of the thermal transport through alkane - based single - molecule junctions . in particular , we have investigated the role of the anchoring group in this length dependence and we have compared the results for alkane chains with those for ptfe chains , which are obtained from the alkanes by substituting the h atoms by f atoms . by investigating the phonon transport for chains with up to 30 segments , we find that the phonon thermal conductance is rather insensitive to the molecular length , irrespective of the molecule .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the phonon transport in these molecular wires is quasi - ballistic .",
    "on the other hand , our analysis of the role of the anchoring group shows that these groups ultimately determine the efficiency of the phonon transport and , in particular , we find that the thiol group leads to higher conductance values than the amine group .",
    "electronic contributions to the thermal conductance do not modify these conclusions , since we demonstrate that they are negligible for alkanes with 4 or more segments .",
    "overall , our results provide clear predictions that we hope will be tested experimentally in the near future given the rapid advances in the field of nanothermometry .",

    "<S> our results demonstrate that ( i ) the room - temperature thermal conductance is fairly length - independent for chains with more than 5 methylene units and ( ii ) the efficiency of the thermal transport is strongly influenced by the strength of the phononic metal - molecule coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our study sheds new light onto the phonon transport in molecular junctions , and it provides clear guidelines for the design of molecular junctions for thermal management . </S>"
