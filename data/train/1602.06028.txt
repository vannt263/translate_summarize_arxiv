    "when releasing information publicly from a database or sharing data with collaborators , data collectors are always concerned about exposing sensitive personal information of individuals who contribute to the data .",

    "the ggm is based on the @xmath0 global sensitivity of queries , a generalization of the @xmath2 global sensitivity .",
    "we present the evidence for the nonexistence of a scale parameter that would result in a ggm of strict @xmath3-dp if released results to be released are unbounded , but suggest the ggm of @xmath4-probabilistic dp ( pdp ) as an alternative in such cases . for bounded data we introduce the truncated ggm and the boundary inflated truncated ( bit ) ggm that satisfy strict @xmath3-dp .",

    "the tightened lower bound is important since it will help to cut down the amount of noise injected to the released result without compromising dp .",
    "we also compare the utility of sanitized results , in terms of the dispersion ( or mean squared error if the expected values of the sanitized results given the original results are the same ) between the gaussian mechanism and the laplace mechanism in independent sanitization . finally , we investigate the connections between the ggm and the exponential mechanism when the utility function in the latter is based on the minkowski distance , and establish the relationship between the sensitivity of the utility function in the exponential mechanism and the @xmath0 gs of queries employed by the ggm .",
