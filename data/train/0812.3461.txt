    "the radiation at a single pulse phase often appears as an incoherent superposition of modes , both orthogonal and non - orthogonal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "evidence has also been presented for variations that may indicate stochastic generalized faraday rotation in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .    in an extensive study of single - pulse polarization fluctuations at 1400  mhz",
    ", @xcite observed that histograms of the linear polarization position angle were broader than could be explained by instrumental noise alone .",
    "this modal broadening of the position angle distribution was interpreted as evidence of a superposed randomized emission component .",
    "@xcite revisited the issue with a statistical model that described correlated intensity fluctuations of completely polarized orthogonal modes . although the predicted position angle distributions were qualitatively similar to the observations , the measured histograms were wider than those produced by a numerical simulation of modal broadening that included instrumental noise .",
    "source - intrinsic noise was later used to explain the excess polarization scatter of bright pulses in an analysis of mode - separated profiles @xcite ; however , it was given no further consideration in all subsequent statistical treatments by @xcite .",
    "these begin with the reasonable assumptions that the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 is low and a sufficiently large number of samples have been averaged , such that the stochastic noise in all four stokes parameters can be treated as uncorrelated and normally distributed .",
    "these assumptions form part of the three - dimensional eigenvalue analyses of the stokes polarization vector by @xcite and @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", these studies concluded that modal broadening is due to the incoherent addition of randomly polarized radiation that is intrinsic to the pulsar .",
    "the basic premises of these experiments are valid for the vast majority of pulsar observations ; however , they become untenable for the bright sources on which these studies focus .",
    "that is , when the instantaneous @xmath1 , the stokes polarization vector can no longer be treated in isolation and the correlated self noise intrinsic to all four stochastic stokes parameters must be accounted .",
    "these considerations are particularly relevant to the study of giant pulses .",
    "those from the crab pulsar reach brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath2 kelvin and remain unresolved in observations with nanosecond resolution @xcite .",
    "consequently , previous analyses of giant pulses have typically presented polarization data at the sampling resolution of the instrument ; that is , where the time - bandwidth product is of the order of unity .",

    "each of these studies concluded that giant pulses are highly polarized .",

    "finally , the results are utilized to reexamine past statistical analyses of orthogonally polarized modes , randomly polarized radiation , and giant pulse polarimetry .",

    "[ 29 ] of cordes 1976 ) must be taken into account .",
    "that is , the self noise of the source induces a positive bias in the modulation index .",

    "if the modes are covariant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for example , consider the incoherent sum of two sources described by stokes parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "[ sec : ensemble ] , the standard deviation of the total intensity and the major axis of the spheroidal distribution of the polarization vector should be equal ; however , for every phase bin listed in table 1 , @xmath163 .",
    "that is , there is no excess dispersion of the polarization vector and therefore no need for additional randomly polarized radiation ; rather , the excess dispersion of the total intensity requires explanation . noting that scalar amplitude modulation and wave coherence uniformly inflate the covariance matrix of the stokes parameters , one possible explanation for @xmath163 is the incoherent superposition of covariant orthogonally polarized modes ( see appendix  [ app : covariant_opm ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of correlation between the mode intensities @xmath150 in equations  ( [ eqn : cov_opm_c00 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : cov_opm_c11 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath164 in the analogous equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of @xcite .",
    "the last term in all four of these equations indicates that positive correlation between the mode intensities increases the variance of the total intensity ( @xmath165 ) and decreases that of the major polarization ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "( anti - correlated mode intensities have the opposite effect . ) the increased variance of the total intensity also explains why orthogonally polarized modes typically coincide with increased amplitude modulation @xcite .",
    "similarly , equation  ( [ eqn : cov_opm_c22 ] ) shows that the self noise of partially polarized modes increases the dimensions of the minor axes ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) .",
    "the source - intrinsic contribution diminishes to zero only for 100% polarized modes . for all of the phase bins listed in table  1 , @xmath169 , indicating that the modes are not completely polarized , as has been previously assumed @xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : cov_opm_c00 ] ) to  ( [ eqn : cov_opm_c01 ] ) and the discussion in appendix  [ app : covariant_opm ] motivate the development of a new technique for producing mode - separated profiles .",
    "from the four - dimensional covariance matrix of the stokes parameters , it is possible to derive the mode intensity correlation coefficient as well as the intensities and degrees of polarization of the modes .",
    "these values and the mean stokes parameters , computed as a function of pulse phase , can be used to decompose the pulse profile into the separate contributions of the orthogonal modes .",
    "the estimation of the degree of polarization of giant pulses is beset by fundamental limitations .",
    "on one hand , giant pulses remain unresolved at the highest time resolutions achieved to date . on the other hand ,",
    "a sufficiently large number of independent samples must be averaged before an accurate estimate of polarization is possible .",
    "even if many time samples are averaged , those samples may be correlated due to scattering on inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium and/or the mean may be dominated by a single unresolved giant nanopulse that greatly reduces the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a histogram of the degree of circular polarization of giant pulses from the crab pulsar observed at 600  mhz .",
    "the histogram is interpreted as evidence that each giant pulse is the sum of @xmath170 nanopulses , each with 100% circular polarization .",
    "however , referring to figure  [ fig : stddev_p ] , the width of the distribution is also consistent with that of completely unpolarized radiation with @xmath171 degrees of freedom .",
    "although the data were averaged over 256 samples to 32  @xmath172s resolution , the characteristic timescale of scattering in these observations was estimated to be @xmath173  @xmath172s ; therefore , the effective number of degrees of freedom is of the order of unity .",
    "small - number statistics also limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the correlations between giant pulse spectra presented in figure 12 of @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic correlation coefficient at small lag was interpreted as evidence that nanopulses are highly polarized . however , with only one estimate of the correlation coefficient at a lag less than 0.1 seconds , the extrapolation to nanosecond resolution is questionable .",
    "therefore , the constraint on the degree of polarization at this timescale is of negligible significance .",
    "a four - dimensional statistical description of polarization is presented that exploits the homomorphism between the lorentz group and the transformation properties of the stokes parameters . within this framework , a generalized expression for the covariance matrix of the stokes parameters is developed and applied to the analysis of single - pulse polarization fluctuations .",
    "the consideration of source - intrinsic noise renders randomly polarized radiation unnecessary , explains the coincidence between increased amplitude modulation and orthogonal mode fluctuations , and indicates that orthogonally polarized modes are only partially polarized .",
    "furthermore , the four - dimensional covariance matrix of the stokes parameters enables estimation of the mode intensities , degrees of polarization , intensity correlation coefficient , and effective degrees of freedom of covariant , orthogonal , partially polarized modes .",
    "measured as a function of pulse phase , these parameters may be used to produce mode - separated profiles without any assumptions about the intrinsic degree of mode polarization .",
    "the formalism is also used to derive the first and second moments of the degree of polarization as a function of the intrinsic degree of polarization and the number of degrees of freedom of the stochastic process .",
    "these are used to demonstrate that giant pulse polarimetry is fundamentally limited by systematic bias due to insufficient statistical degrees of freedom .",
    "the discussions of amplitude modulation in ",
    "[ sec : modulation ] and wave coherence in   [ sec : coherence ] serve to illustrate the difficulties in defining an appropriate average when the signal is unresolved . in this regard ,",
    "the approach employed in this paper is complimentary to previous analyses that make use of auto - correlation functions and fluctuation spectra to separately measure the statistics of the total and polarized intensities .",
    "useful new results may be derived by extending the techniques employed in these works to include the cross - correlation terms that describe the statistical dependences between the stokes parameters .",
