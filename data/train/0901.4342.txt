    "density perturbations at the epoch of recombination are imprinted onto the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , leaving temperature anisotropy that has now been well - studied on a wide range of angular scales . on scales of several arcminutes and smaller , corresponding to multipole moments of @xmath5 , the level of cmb anisotropy power from primordial fluctuations",
    "is strongly suppressed by photon diffusion , and secondary sources of power , including the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) , are expected to play a significant role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the sze results from the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by the hot electron gas within clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this interaction leaves a small spectral distortion in the cmb which produces anisotropy power on scales of @xmath6 , detectable as a decrement in the cmb intensity at 30  ghz .",
    "the amplitude of this power is extremely sensitive to the history of structure formation and , specifically , to the value of @xmath7 , the normalization of the matter power spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "evidence for anisotropy above that expected from the primary cmb on these small angular scales has been detected at 30  ghz by the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) and berkeley illinois maryland association ( bima ) experiments @xcite .",
    "recent constraints on excess power at these scales from the arcminute cosmology bolometric array receiver ( acbar ) at 150  ghz indicate that the reported excess power is inconsistent with thermal cmb fluctuations but is consistent with sze fluctuations @xcite . taken together",
    ", these measurements indicate a level of sze anisotropy power consistent with a value of @xmath7 somewhat greater than those preferred by other contemporary measurements of the parameter @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe a new , high - sensitivity measurement of power in the cmb on scales ranging from @xmath8 made at 30  ghz with the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) .",
    "the cmb anisotropy data presented here were obtained with the sza , an eight - element interferometer located at caltech s owens valley radio observatory near bishop , california .",
    "the sza antennas are equipped with sensitive , wide - bandwidth receivers operating at 30  ghz and 90  ghz . for these observations we used the 30  ghz receivers , tuned to detect sky frequencies of 27@xmath935  ghz .",
    "the receivers are based on low - noise , cryogenic high electron mobility transistor amplifiers @xcite , with characteristic receiver temperatures @xmath10 . including atmospheric and other noise contributions , the typical system temperatures were 35@xmath945  k. the 3.5 m sza antennas have a primary beam that is well described by a gaussian with a fwhm of 11  at the center of the 30  ghz band .",
    "cross - correlations of the signals from pairs of the eight antennas ( _ visibilities _ ) are formed in a digital correlator , which processes the 8  ghz if bandwidth in 16 bands of 500  mhz , each of which is further subdivided into 17 channels of 31  mhz , allowing rejection of narrow - band interference .    for the anisotropy measurements reported here , the sza antennas were arranged in a hybrid configuration to provide simultaneous sensitivity to the arcminute - scale structure of the sze signal from galaxy clusters and the finer - scale contamination from radio sources ( details of the configuration can be found in * ? ? ?",
    "six of the eight antennas were packed closely together ( spacings of 4.5@xmath911.5  m ) , yielding 15 baselines with typical projected lengths of 400@xmath91400@xmath11 , corresponding to arcminute angular scales ; the window function for our anisotropy measurement is determined by the baselines formed from combinations of these six antennas . by convolving the distribution of projected baseline lengths in the unflagged data with the autocorrelation of the antenna illumination pattern , we obtain the @xmath12-space window function shown in figure  [ fig : win_ps ] .",
    "this is the filter through which we observe the power spectrum ; multiplying this function by @xmath13 and integrating over @xmath12 yields our measurement , where @xmath14 is the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "the sensitivity - weighted mean value of the window is @xmath15 , with 68% of the area encompassed by the interval @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to the central six antennas , two antennas were positioned @xmath1750  m from the array center .",
    "the 13 baselines involving these antennas are sensitive to @xmath18  scales , corresponding to multipoles of @xmath19 , and can be used to identify radio sources that contaminate the short - baseline data .    between 2005 november and 2007 june , we devoted 1340 hr of observations to 44 sza deep fields , comprising 2 deg@xmath20 .",
    "these fields were selected to pass nearly overhead at the @xmath21 latitude of the telescopes , and arranged in right ascension to accommodate other large sza observing programs . within these constraints ,",
    "the fields were placed at locations with low galactic emission in the @xmath22 100  @xmath23 m survey .",
    "no consideration was given to the presence of radio sources to avoid any bias that might be introduced by the correlation between radio sources and galaxy clusters .",
    "one of the 44 fields was found to contain a 700  mjy radio source ( @xmath24 ) ; unable to exclude this source from our data with sufficient precision , we are forced to omit this field from our analysis . using simulated sze sky maps we have verified that even in the pessimistic case in which this single field contains the most power of any of our fields , the bias introduced by excluding it is 10%",
    ".    observations were designed to allow subtraction of ground contamination .",
    "fields were observed at constant declination in groups of four , spaced by four minutes of right ascension .",
    "we observed the fields in 16 minute blocks between observations of a nearby phase calibrator .",
    "each field , starting with the westernmost field of the group , was observed for just under 4 minutes at a time , so that after including time lost to slews and calibration we tracked all four fields through precisely the same azimuth / elevation path .",
    "this ensures that each sees the same contribution from the ground , which can be removed by subtracting the mean of the four fields ( in practice we implement this subtraction by means of a constraint matrix , described in section  [ sec : lh ] ) . at an integration time of 20",
    "s , we obtain 10 integrations per field in each cycle .",
    "the total integration time per field was @xmath25 hr .",
    "of this , approximately 20% of the data were discarded due to hardware problems , antenna shadowing , excessive noise , or jumps in calibrator phase or system temperature which occurred on a time - scale faster than our calibrations .",
    "an additional @xmath175% of the data were flagged for showing unexpected correlations among baselines and bands or statistically unlikely noise behavior on a single antenna .",
    "these cuts significantly improved the results of the jackknife tests discussed in section  [ sec : jk ] ; the data quality cuts were refined using only the jackknifed data sets to avoid biasing ourselves against signal . the first member of each group of four sza fields is listed in table [ tab : fieldtab ] , along with its position , the total , unflagged , on - source integration time , and the achieved rms noise level for the field , both with and without data from the long baselines .",

    "we use the @xcite model to predict the brightness temperature of mars as a function of frequency and time .",
    "since the planet is partially resolved by our longest baselines , a strong , unresolved source is used to transfer the calibration from the short baselines .",
    "the absolute calibration was cross - checked by comparing sza observations of jupiter to those of _",
    "wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) and cbi @xcite . based on these measurements",
    ", we conservatively estimate that our absolute flux scale is accurate to better than 10% ( 20% in power ) .",
    "away from the galactic plane , the most significant contributor of non - cmb power on arcminute angular scales at 30  ghz is compact radio sources .",
    "since the power from these sources is constant as a function of @xmath12 , their contribution to @xmath26 can be quite large at small angular scales . while the brightest sources at 30  ghz can be detected by the long baselines of the sza , sources near our noise level ( and hence undetectable in our data ) can still contribute substantial power to the measurement .",
    "we therefore supplement our data with a higher - sensitivity search for radio sources in our fields using the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the large disparity between the vla ( 25  m ) and sza ( 3.5  m ) antenna sizes makes it impractical to survey the sza fields at a frequency near 30  ghz .",
    "instead , we elected to conduct the vla survey at 8  ghz , a compromise between survey speed , which decreases toward higher frequency as the vla primary beam shrinks , and spectral extrapolation of the detected sources . in 2006 november , we collected 36 hr of data with the vla in its c configuration , targeting the 24 fields that the sza had observed at that point . in 2008",
    "august , an additional set of observations covering all but two of the remaining fields were obtained in the more compact d configuration , which better matches the angular resolution of the sza long baselines . because the vla primary beam at 8  ghz is only 4.9  across",
    ", it was necessary to make mosaic observations with 19 pointings to cover the area of the sza s larger primary beam .",
    "we reached a noise level of @xmath27jy at the center of this mosaic pattern , less than 1/6 of the noise level in our sza data .",
    "the integration time is tapered at pointings away from the center of the mosaic , such that the achieved sensitivity in the 8  ghz maps has a profile that matches that of the 30  ghz data , set by the sza primary beam pattern .",
    "the vla data were calibrated and mosaicked in aips .",
    "the map sensitivity @xmath28 was determined from the mosaic images using the task rmsd .",
    "sources were then extracted from the maps using the task sad , with a limiting significance of 5@xmath28 , yielding more than 180 sources .",
    "due to weather and scheduling limitations , two of the sza fields were not observed with the vla at 8  ghz .",
    "we omit the entire group of four fields that includes this pair from the analysis that follows , in addition to the single field that contained a bright radio source .",
    "this leaves us with 39 of the 44 observed fields to include in our analysis .",
    "as an interferometer , the sza directly measures the fourier components of the sky brightness .",
    "since it is precisely the variance of these components that the power spectrum describes , interferometers are well suited for measuring the power spectrum , without the intervening stage of map making ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have used a maximum likelihood method to extract measurements of the power spectrum from our data .",
    "following @xcite , we construct a vector @xmath29 of @xmath30 visibilities and a likelihood estimator that is a function of @xmath29 and the cmb power @xmath31 , assumed to be constant across the range of angular scales probed by the sza .",
    "we expect our data , and thus the likelihood function , to be gaussian , so that the likelihood is given by : @xmath32 where n is the length of the data vector @xmath29 , and the covariance @xmath33 of the data is written as the sum of a contribution from the cmb , the diagonal instrument noise , and a set of constraints ( see below ) : @xmath34    if our visibilities were independent of one another , the contribution to the covariance matrix from the cmb signal , @xmath35 , would be the identity matrix times the level of cmb power , @xmath31 .",
    "we assume a flat band power , i.e. , constant @xmath26 .",
    "however , in practice , visibilities can be correlated , depending on the separation of the fourier - space ( ) coordinates they sample .",
    "a visibility corresponding to a given  coordinate is in fact an integral over a small patch of the fourier plane , weighted by the antenna s aperture autocorrelation function ; the overlap integral of this function centered on two neighboring  coordinates yields the correlation between adjacent measurements .",
    "we calculate these overlap integrals for each of our visibilities and insert the resulting matrix into the total covariance matrix as indicated in equation ( [ eqn : covar ] ) .",
    "visibilities that are more than 95% correlated are averaged together .",
    "the instrumental contribution to the noise , @xmath36 , dominates the weak signal from the cmb anisotropy and must therefore be accurately determined .",
    "we estimate the noise variance from the scatter of visibilities taken on 20 s timescales within a 4 minute scan . from the 10 visibilities within each scan",
    ", we subtract the mean of the real and imaginary parts from each sample and then compute a single sample variance from the 20 mean - subtracted numbers .",
    "all averages within the analysis are uniformly weighted , as weighting by variances derived from just 20 samples introduces substantial biases .",
    "the resulting noise estimates are independent of one another , so @xmath36 in equation ( [ eqn : covar ] ) is diagonal .",
    "we have verified through simulation that variances measured in this way produce an unbiased estimate of the noise , and , hence of the cmb power level .",
    "we expect the sky signal to be dominated by radio sources that are point - like at the sza s arcminute resolution , principally active galactic nuclei emitting synchrotron radiation at radio frequencies . through the use of constraint matrices",
    "@xcite , we can eliminate the modes of the data that are corrupted by these sources , provided that we know their positions .",
    "the constraint matrix is computed by writing a template vector of visibilities that describes the contribution of the contaminant in question to each  component ; in the case of a point source at position @xmath37 with respect to the interferometer s phase center , the contribution @xmath38 to the visibility measured with component @xmath39 is given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an unknown amplitude . by forming the outer product of this vector with itself ,",
    "@xmath42 , we find the covariance created among our @xmath30 visibilities by a source at this position ; the amplitude of this covariance remains unknown , but its shape is fixed by the ( known ) source location .",
    "each constraint matrix is then multiplied by a large prefactor ( as large as possible without causing the matrix to become poorly conditioned for inversion ) and added to the total covariance matrix in our likelihood function , effectively setting to zero the weight of the mode corresponding to the source .",
    "the unknown amplitude is therefore unimportant ; the operation is equivalent to marginalizing over the source s unknown flux .",
    "we form such a matrix for each source that we wish to eliminate from our data ; because each matrix is created from a single vector , each has rank one and eliminates 1 degree of freedom .",
    "radio sources in our data may have a wide range of spectral indices and can not in general be excluded by a single constraint .",
    "instead , we project 3 modes of different spectral index for each source ; we therefore lose three degrees of freedom for each projected source .",
    "we have verified in simulation that a linear combination of these components can effectively remove the contribution of a source of any reasonable spectral index .",
    "we remove a component common to the fields within a group of four ( ground or antenna crosstalk ) using a similar constraint .",
    "this constraint identifies each visibility among a group of four with its three counterparts in different fields , all of which are measured at the same antenna position .",
    "projecting this constraint is equivalent to subtracting the mean of the four visibilities from each of them , and therefore reduces the sensitivity by 25% .",
    "the radio source positions are derived from several data sets .",
    "the brightest sources at 30  ghz are identifiable directly in the sza data . for purposes of source detection , we combine the long and short - baseline data ( typical noise of @xmath43jy ) , providing 30% better sensitivity to compact sources than would be obtained using only the short baselines from which our anisotropy measurement is determined . above a significance of @xmath44 in the 30  ghz data , 42 of 44 detected sources have counterparts in the 8  ghz vla survey ; the remaining two sources were found to be extended even at the 20  resolution of the long sza baselines and are likely heavily resolved by the vla in its c configuration ( 3  resolution ) .",
    "both of these sources have 1.4  ghz counterparts in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) , which has angular resolution intermediate to that of the long and short sza baselines , giving us confidence that they are real , extended sources rather than noise peaks in our 30 ghz maps .    as sources below our 30  ghz detection threshold",
    "can still contribute significant anisotropy power , we constrain 180 sources detected at 5@xmath28 in the 8  ghz survey , as well as the two sources detected at 30  ghz that are too resolved to be seen with the vla .",
    "the effect of using different detection thresholds in the two data sets can be seen in table  [ tab : pntsrc ] .",
    "clearly , radio sources contribute the bulk of the detected anisotropy ; even sources just above the 5@xmath28 threshold at either frequency contribute substantial power .",
    "we also note that the two sources without 8  ghz counterparts contribute a sizable fraction of our final power ; the inclusion of these two sources is therefore important to our final result .",

    ", we take the product of all of their likelihood curves to form a global likelihood for the experiment ; we report the maximum of this curve as the most likely power , and we use the points that correspond to 16% and 84% of the cumulative likelihood to define the 68% confidence interval .",
    "the likelihood is allowed to extend below zero power .",
    "we tested this analysis pipeline extensively with simulated data , including tests in which the data generation and power spectrum analysis were performed by different parties , using independent software packages , and found consistent results in all cases .",
    "processing the data as described above , we can compute the relative likelihood of different levels of cmb power , given our data .",
    "we now subject the data to three jackknife tests to rule out contaminating power from non - astronomical sources or from inaccuracies in our noise variance estimation . in the jackknife tests ,",
    "the data are split into halves , each of which measures very nearly the same set of spatial fourier components .",
    "the data are taken in such a way that three of these splits are possible : ( 1 ) a frequency jackknife , wherein we separate alternating 500 mhz frequency bands , as neighboring bands sample very nearly the same  points , ( 2 ) a jackknife in which the data are separated into halves by time , and ( 3 ) a jackknife in which the data are separated into even and odd days .",
    "the latter two jackknife tests take advantage of the fact that the sza observed the same fields in the same way for many days .    after dividing the data into halves",
    ", we difference the matching pairs of visibilities .",
    "emission from astronomical sources , which is common to both halves , is removed , while any contamination that varies with time or frequency will remain in the differenced ( jackknifed ) data .",
    "note that the requirement that there be matching , unflagged visibilities in both halves for each test results in some additional loss of data and degradation of the measurement sensitivity , particularly in the two time - jackknife tests .",
    "we compute variances from the differenced visibilities , and compute the power in each jackknifed data set just as for our unjackknifed data , with the expectation that the measured power will be consistent with zero .",
    "the jackknife tests also verify our noise model ; if the noise in our data has been misestimated , we expect that the jackknifed data will be poorly described by our computed covariance matrices .",
    "the jackknife tests provide evidence that we detect a signal correlated with the orientation of our antennas relative to the ground .",
    "this signal may originate from antenna crosstalk or ground emission . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : szadata ] , the observations were designed to allow removal of such  ground contamination \" by subtracting the average of each group of four observations via an additional constraint .",
    "we find that without removing this component ( but including strict cuts on data quality discussed in   [ sec : szadata ] ) the frequency jackknife test fails badly , with a probability to exceed the jackknifed @xmath52 of @xmath53 . after implementing the ground subtraction , the three jackknife tests all pass , as seen in table [ tab : jk ] , with probabilities to exceed the @xmath52 greater than 0.1 .",
    "we therefore employ ground subtraction to determine anisotropy power in all the analyses presented in this paper .",
    "our analysis procedure is blind to the final result , as we have refined our data cuts and analysis treatment based only on the jackknife tests .",

    "repeating the analysis on the unjackknifed data , including ground - subtraction and constraining radio sources detected at @xmath58 in both the 8 ghz vla data and the 30 ghz sza data , leads to a residual power of @xmath59 . to set constraints on secondary cmb anisotropy",
    ", we must estimate the residual power contributions to this measurement from other astronomical sources . in this section ,",
    "we first consider contributions from primary cmb anisotropy , undetected radio sources , and diffuse galactic emission , and we end with our constraint on the level of secondary anisotropy .",
    "we note that contributions from undetected radio sources and diffuse galactic emission are , in principle , distinguishable from the cmb by their spectral signature across the 25% fractional bandwidth of the sza data .",
    "however , it is not possible to distinguish a preferred spectral index given the low signal - to - noise ratio of the data .      at a multipole of @xmath60 ,",
    "the wmap5 cosmology @xcite predicts no significant primary cmb anisotropy ( figure  [ fig : win_ps ] ) .",

    "an additional source of potential foreground contamination in our power spectrum measurement comes from galactic dust .",
    "while the predictions of @xcite at 30  ghz imply @xmath65 contribution for thermal dust emission , there has been evidence that dipole radiation from small , spinning dust grains may dominate the total dust emission at 30  ghz .",
    "such emission is expected to peak at frequencies of tens of ghz and to be tightly correlated with galactic dust @xcite .",

    "results for each set of simulated maps are shown in figure [ fig : sim_power ] .",
    "the strong dependence of the detected power on the value of @xmath7 is clear , as are significant systematic differences among simulations .",
    "the maximum likelihood power for the secondary cmb anisotropy measured by the sza is shown by a shaded horizontal bar in the figure .",
    "the shaded bar indicates the 68% confidence interval , including the uncertainty in the absolute calibration and the subtraction of power from primary cmb anisotropy and undetected radio sources .",
    "figure [ fig : sim_power ] shows that the range of @xmath7 values consistent with the sza anisotropy measurement is large , reflecting significant differences among the simulations .",
    "the figure shows there is no tension between the sza anisotropy measurement with @xmath83 determined from recent measurements using other techniques , while values higher than 0.9 are disfavored .",
    "we note that the power spectra derived from simulated @xmath78-maps have greater sample variance than maps of gaussian noise with the same rms power .",
    "while we can measure the variance in simulation by measuring the scatter of many realizations of our experiment , in the actual data we assume gaussianity in calculating our error bars .",
    "we are therefore underestimating the sample variance in our measurement . using the simulated @xmath78-maps , we find that the magnitude of this underestimate has a weak dependence on the value of @xmath7 , but for @xmath84 the actual confidence region of our measurement is likely 1.5 times broader than the range reported here , which assumes gaussian sample variance",
    ".      there is observational evidence that radio sources are spatially correlated with clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "because the short sza baselines are sensitive to both compact radio sources and the cluster sz signal , the projection of cluster - correlated radio sources could , in principle , remove significant secondary anisotropy along with the radio source power , biasing our measurement low .",
    "we examine the magnitude of this effect by simulating our measurement .",
    "we simulate observations of sets of 39 compton @xmath78-maps from @xcite including appropriate instrumental noise .",
    "for these fields we generate radio source populations according to the prescription of section  [ sec : radsrcs ] and include constraints for those that would be detected in our 8 or 30  ghz data .",
    "we introduce a pessimistic degree of correlation between clusters and radio sources by increasing the radio source density in the inner 0.5  of the simulated clusters according to the excess observed toward massive ( @xmath85 ) clusters by @xcite .",
    "we find that the mean measured power in these maps is reduced by 50% .",
    "this should be a significant overestimate of the effect in our observations as the signal we seek comes from clusters an order of magnitude less massive than those observed by @xcite , with proportionately fewer radio sources per halo .",
    "although the short sza baselines are unable to discriminate between radio sources and clusters , the long baseline data are wellsuited to making this distinction and could be used to recover the power lost to projection of correlated sources .",
    "our simulations show that the inclusion of long baselines in our analysis restores an average of 25% of the lost power .",
    "however , for any particular realization of the data the difference between the power measured with and without the long baselines may be positive or negative , with only a slight preference for increased power for our noise level and given the @xmath86 mean power in the simulated maps .",
    "we therefore conclude that for a single realization of our observation ( the real data ) , a comparison of the anisotropy with and without the long baselines is not a useful predictor of the fraction of power lost to source - cluster correlation .",
    "previous measurements at 30  ghz by cbi @xcite and bima @xcite have suggested power at high @xmath12 in excess of the primary cmb anisotropy , implying a value of @xmath7 inconsistent with other contemporary measurements of the parameter if the excess power is attributed to sz signal .",
    "the cbi experiment reported @xmath87 for their high-@xmath12 bin spanning @xmath88 , of which 80@xmath990  @xmath3 is attributed to primary cmb anisotropy .",
    "the bima experiment reported @xmath89 for @xmath90 , at which there is no significant primary cmb contribution .",
    "the sza data presented here do not show evidence of excess power .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the sza result and the cbi and bima results is not highly significant after accounting for measurement uncertainties and particularly the non - gaussian sample variance discussed above . here",
    ", we investigate whether the discrepancies may also be partially accounted for by the different prescriptions used to account for residual radio source power .    for the cbi experiment , @xcite used nvss to remove sources with a limiting 1.4  ghz flux of 3.4  mjy from their 30  ghz anisotropy data .",
    "they estimated the residual contribution from undetected sources to be @xmath91 of their highest-@xmath12 bandpower , or @xmath92 , with an uncertainty of @xmath93 .",
    "repeating our sza analysis using the same prescription , i.e. , constraining only sources detected at @xmath94  mjy in the nvss survey , results in an increase of our measured power by @xmath95 , raising our total residual power to @xmath96 .",
    "extrapolating this to the @xmath97 of the cbi measurement according to the respective window functions of the two experiments implies a residual power of @xmath98 for the cbi result , only slightly higher than reported and consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "the discrepancy between the measurement presented here and that of cbi is therefore unlikely to be due to the different prescriptions for estimating residual point source power .",
    "the bima experiment @xcite used a 4.8  ghz vla survey , with depth comparable to our 8  ghz survey , to generate source constraints for their anisotropy measurement .",
    "based on the flattening of measured power versus vla detection threshold , they estimated that radio sources contribute negligible residual power .",
    "we note that the flattening of the measured power with detection threshold could indicate other sources of contamination not constrained by their observational strategy , such as ground pickup .",
    "the low significance of the bima result , especially in light of the large sample variance resulting from the small sky area covered by the measurement , implies no significant tension with the result presented here .",
    "we present results from 30  ghz measurements of the cmb angular power spectrum with the sza , on scales where the secondary anisotropy from the sze is expected to dominate . for a broad bin centered at multipole 4066",
    ", we find @xmath0 , of which @xmath1 is the expected contribution from primary cmb anisotropy and @xmath2 is the expected contribution from undetected radio sources .",
    "the resulting constraint on secondary anisotropy is @xmath72 , implying an upper limit of @xmath73 at 95% cl ( @xmath74 at 68% ) .",
    "the sza results indicate lower secondary anisotropy power than previously reported at 30  ghz by cbi @xcite and bima @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between the sza result and the cbi and bima results , however , are not highly significant after accounting for measurement uncertainties and non - gaussian sample variance .",
    "we show that the level of sze anisotropy power implied by the sza measurement is in good agreement with expectations based on simulated compton @xmath78-maps made with @xmath4 , but disfavor values of @xmath99 . the differences among various simulations , however , prevent a more quantitative determination of @xmath7 .",
