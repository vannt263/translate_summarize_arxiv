    "currently , nearly 300 extra - solar planets have been detected ( http://www.exoplanets.eu/ ) , and most of them are massive ( jupiter - like ) planets with small ( fractions of au ) semi - major axes ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review on detection methods and on the main properties of exo - planets ) .",
    "theoretical models for the formation of planetary systems are then mostly based on the crucial role of an accretion disc around a forming young star , where the disc provides both the material for the forming planets and the interactions responsible for the migration of the protoplanets towards the central star .",
    "the need for protoplanetary migration comes from the difficulty of an `` in situ '' formation in such close to the star positions , so that the detailed understanding of migration mechanisms appears mandatory in order to build self - consistent models for planetary systems formation .",
    "some analytic studies on the matter @xcite suggest that gravitational torques due to resonant non - axisymmetric structures could act to transfer angular momentum between the protoplanets and the disc ( for a discussion of other alternative migration models see @xcite and references therein ) . the gravitational disturbance exerted by the protoplanet on the disc produces spiral density waves which break the axial symmetry of the disc structure .",
    "perturbation theory allows an estimate of the net torque that this perturbed disc exerts back onto the planet at `` lindblad resonance sites '' @xcite .",
    "this disc - planet interaction induces also a repulsion of material on either side of the protoplanet s orbit , with a possible formation of a density gap , depending on the interaction strength .",
    "two main migration types are then distinguished : _",
    "@xcite , when an earth - like planet , not capable of opening a density gap in the disc is embedded in the disc structure .",
    "in this case the migration rate should be proportional to the protoplanet mass ; _ type ii _ when a massive protoplanet , capable of opening and maintaining a density gap , remains trapped in this gap . in this case migration is due to the viscosity dominated evolution of the disc . in both cases it is possible that the lifetime of migration is shorter than the lifetimes of planet formation or disc dissolution , causing the collapse of the planet toward the star .",
    "accurate numerical simulations are necessary to better understand the matter @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this work is to study the role of initial and boundary conditions on planetary migration as a consequence of planet - disc dynamic interaction during the initial formation phases of stellar systems .",
    "several papers devoted to this theme , according to various fluid - dynamics schemes @xcite , showed that this mechanism should be very effective for the protoplanet dragging toward the central protostar in characteristic time - scales of the order of @xmath0 years .",
    "these studies assume that the accretion disc is basically keplerian and pressure forces are often neglected among the protostar - disc interactions . in keplerian models , the keplerian distribution of disc gas velocity",
    "is usually assumed as a reasonable hypothesis @xcite .",
    "however , as other authors have already done for a wider context during the accretion disc formation phase @xcite or for small sub - keplerian correction due to the contribution of pressure gradients @xcite , we find useful to explore here the role of sub - keplerian flows as an open possibility for pre - main sequence accretion , as well as their role in the radial transport of solid bodies .",
    "therefore sub - keplerian flows in the formation of protoplanetary accretion discs are here analysed as a parametric study ( see section [ initial_conditions ] for details on exact initial conditions ) .",
    "+ in this paper non viscous cartesian 2d sph sub - keplerian disc models are given , with planetary migration times both for jovian and for terrestrial planets .",
    "models of jovian or terrestrial planets , interacting with an initial keplerian accretion disc , are also produced for a strict comparison .",
    "+ the coming out of shock fronts and complex structures , both steady and progressive in sub - keplerian turbulent accretion flows in agn , was described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as well as pulsed or periodic outflows in @xcite as a consequence of collisional interactions in the disc surrounding the central accreting object in axial symmetry . in such environments ( agn or equivalently protostellar systems ) , the potential importance of the centrifugal barrier in developing outflow structures in turbulent collisional fluid - dynamics , was successfully described in those papers .",
    "this implies that the possibility of a slower dragging toward the central star can not be excluded in principle .",
    "therefore , as a secondary aim , the purpose of the paper is the methodical search for those initial and boundary conditions determining results showing how jovian and terrestrial protoplanets could stay in orbits surrounding the central stars at distances of the order of that of venus or mercury .    in section [ model_boundary ]",
    "we discuss the initial and boundary conditions characterising our models . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we describe our results , and we discuss them in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the simulations presented in this work are based on a two - dimensional model which makes use of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) numerical method @xcite .",
    "the choice of using the sph method is funded on the grounds of its lagrangian nature and its ability to easily tackle hydrodynamic problems with free surfaces .",
    "the ability of many different numerical schemes , both grid - based and lagrangian , to correctly describe planet - gas interactions was tested by @xcite , showing that sph is not significantly less performant than other methods . given the lack of a wide range of case studies on the matter in sph , we believe that our work could give an interesting contribution to improve the basic knowledge on disc - protoplanet interaction .",
    "+ the code does not contain a specific radiation treatment , but the used equation of state : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the thermal energy per unit mass , includes the polytropic index @xmath4 , which can be adjusted to values lower than 5/3 if radiation , partial molecular dissociation or partial ionisation effects are present , giving the overall effect of a higher compressibility to the gas .",
    "current calculations are performed with the simple choice of @xmath5 , but we intend to further investigate this matter in a future work . + the model is built in cartesian coordinates with dimensionless quantities .",
    "reference physical units are :    * the initial stellar mass @xmath6 ; * the stellar radius @xmath7 ; * the keplerian period of an orbit of radius @xmath7 around a star of mass @xmath6 , @xmath8    with these choices , the following units can be used to transform our numerical results in physical quantities :    * velocity : @xmath9 * specific angular momentum : @xmath10 * energy per unit mass : @xmath11 * surface density : @xmath12    the initial conditions used to build the accretion disc are axially symmetric .",
    "the accretion disc is in fact created through the injection of particles at point - like positions ( injectors ) along circles concentric with the central star .",
    "particles have initial tangential velocities set by choosing a value for the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath13 . at some point ,",
    "the accretion disc reaches a `` nearly ''",
    "steady state population of particles ( time averaged since some variation of the number of particles and of the density distributions are actually observed during our simulations , due to the highly turbulent nature of our calculated flows ) with @xmath14 particles , depending on the model , when using a smoothing length ( spatial resolution parameter of the sph method ) @xmath15 . at this stage ,",
    "the planet is inserted and the model is evolved .",
    "we included the following interactions in our models :    1 .",
    "gravitational interaction between gas particles and central star ; 2 .",
    "gravitational interaction between planet and star ; 3 .",
    "gravitational interaction between particles and planet ; 4 .",
    "gas pressure between neighbouring gas particles ; 5 .   artificial viscosity ( pressure contribution ) between gas particles ; 6 .",
    "gas particle capture by the planet ( conservation of momentum is used to correct the planet speed before removing the particle ) when gas particles approach the planet area ( planet - particle distance less than @xmath16 ) .",
    "additionally , in some of our models , we tried to add the above missing pressure interaction between the disc gas and the protoplanet . with the above specified conditions ,",
    "our models do not have the necessary spatial resolution to treat the details of the interaction between the gas and the protoplanet surface .",
    "the simplest way to add pressure interaction in this case , is to add a further `` ad hoc '' sph gas particle at the protoplanet position , giving to it the planet s velocity and the mass of the other surrounding gas particles .",
    "the density is then calculated according to the sph method and the pressure force acting onto this particle is directly transferred to the planet itself .",
    "though this approach , which is hereafter indicated as adding a `` pseudo - atmosphere '' to the protoplanet , may appear simplistic , it allows the introduction of the , otherwise totally missing , pressure interaction acting onto the planet . +",
    "no self - gravitation is included in the gas for computational reasons , and this is not believed to negatively affect our computations since the disc total mass is @xmath17 the number of particles , which for @xmath18 particles means @xmath19 ( in units of the central star mass @xmath6 ) , so that the dominating gravitational force is still that of the central star . reported values for disc masses are in the range @xmath20 on the grounds of observational constraints from t - tauri stars @xcite , but this value is usually distributed over a disc with a radius of @xmath21 . in order to compare this to the structure of our simulated disc , given the dimensionless nature of our simulation , we need to choose some physical reference units .",
    "if 1 m@xmath22 and 2 - 3 r@xmath22 are taken for a typical t - tauri star @xcite , the disc has a dimension of about @xmath23 au .",
    "therefore our simulations cover only the central part of a typical t - tauri accretion disc , and the mass included in the simulation is in agreement with observational constraints .",
    "most accretion disc models in literature include viscosity , according to the disc model of @xcite .",
    "even today , it is hard to find a self - consistent way to give a correct value for the @xmath24 viscosity parameter .",
    "we choose instead to not include physical viscous terms in the equations of our models , because we are here focused on the protoplanet migration mechanism based on gravitational and pressure forces and momentum transfer through gas particle captures , rather than to viscosity driven migration .",
    "our models our non viscous , meaning that ar based on the euler equations .",
    "the absence of physical viscosity enhances the turbulent nature of our simulation , allowing us to correctly describe some effects due to turbulence like the development of non - axisymmetric structures in the disc ( induced also by the presence of the protoplanet ) .",
    "turbulence might also produce stronger shock fronts when infalling gas particles hit the centrifugal barrier .",
    "+ there are plans to include physical viscosity in a future work , in order to better explore the viscosity driven migrations ( like in type ii migration models ) and viscosity contribution in general .",
    "three choices are made here for the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath13 : 18 , 36 , 54 , for particles injected at a radial distance of 130 .",
    "all the three choices give a sub - keplerian feature to the velocity distribution of the accretion disc ( particles injected at a radial distance of 130 would have keplerian velocity with @xmath25 ) , so that injected particles start decreasing their distance to the centre , until they `` hit '' the centrifugal barrier .",
    "these choices are considered in the the framework of a parametric study , to test the effect of a wide range of possible conditions , from `` extreme '' ( @xmath26 ) to `` weak '' ( @xmath27 ) sub - keplerian .",
    "the mass of the particles is set to @xmath28 ( in units of @xmath6 ) , which means that the total mass of the disc can be about @xmath29 .",
    "calculations are performed with two masses for the planet : @xmath30 ( earth - like planet ) and @xmath31 ( jupiter - like planet ) .",
    "the computational domain is circular , extended in the xy plane with a radius of 150 ( the star is located in the `` origin '' ) , and the planet is located inside the disc plane , with the initial position at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and an initial zero eccentricity .",
    "+    the azimuthally averaged density profiles of the sub - keplerian accretion discs , just before planet insertion , are plotted in figure [ initial_density_profiles ] for the three cases ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a density peak is present near the centrifugal barrier in each case .",
    "for @xmath26 the peak is close to the star , while for higher @xmath13 values the density close to the star has values similar to those found at the disc outer edges .",
    "density in sph is computed according to local particle mass distribution . at the disc outer edge",
    ", particles are produced and injected in the stellar gravitational potential well .",
    "instead particles are in a free fall very close to the central star , where gravitational potential rules the whole gas dynamics , and they are `` removed '' from the simulation ( the mass of the particle is added to the star mass ) when they reach a radial position equal to the star radius . + as far as the disc material accretion rate onto the central star , if 1 m@xmath22 and 2 - 3 r@xmath22 are taken for a typical t - tauri star @xcite",
    ", we obtain for the three cases values of @xmath35 with oscillations of about @xmath36 .",
    "these values are in agreement with estimated accretion rates for t - tauri stars @xcite . + in order to compare some of our results with more traditional models , some computations ( two with an earth - like planet and two with a jupiter - like planet ) are built using an initial exactly keplerian distribution of gas particle velocities , with an initial uniform density over the entire disc area .",
    "for simplicity , we will refer to these models as `` keplerian '' , even if the velocity distribution of the gas particles can not remain exactly keplerian during the simulation , due to the pressure forces within the gas and to the interactions between the planet and the accretion disc .",
    "these models will be used to test the eventual formation of a gap near the protoplanet location , and to compare some classical views on the subject @xcite with our results obtained with an inviscid model . + a summary of the distinguishing features of our models is given in table [ models_table ] together with identifying labels .",
    ".list of computed models , with their identifying labels ( first column ) .",
    "the second column gives the specific angular momentum of injected gas particles , the third column gives the initial mass of the protoplanet and the fourth column indicates the eventual presence of the pseudo - atmosphere on the protoplanet .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ exp_fit ] the last two columns give the inverse values of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and they have been dimensioned in years by choosing 1 @xmath39 and @xmath40 as reference units . of the two time - scales estimated in this way ,",
    "the most important is the one with the corresponding highest `` multiplying factor for the exponential '' ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) . for jupiter - like planets these estimates",
    "must be taken with some care , as the simulations did not go enough far in time to have a clear path of the migration process , so that migration timeline of these models could be different than what expected from extrapolations .",
    "+ in table [ linear_fit ] the 4th column gives a dimensionless migration time , evaluated as @xmath43 , and the last column gives the same time converted in years by choosing the same reference units as in table [ exp_fit ] .",
    "+ for models @xmath41 and @xmath37 ( jovian planet ) a linear fit already gives a good description of the angular momentum evolution of the planet , but an exponential fit has also been performed because , on a longer time - scale ( a few thousands orbits ) , the curve showing @xmath13 as a function of time could resemble that of the @xmath42 and @xmath38 models .",
    "we are therefore able to analyse the different migration lifetimes through comparable parameters ( exponential lifetime or linear costant derivative ) .",
    "+ for some of @xmath42 and @xmath38 models , the behaviour is initially linear and it becomes more exponential once the protoplanet reaches a position closer to the star . in these cases , the linear fit has been done for a limited time interval during which the evolution does not show a significant migration rate variation . a peculiar case is the @xmath44 model where an initial linear behaviour with negative derivative is followed by a nearly complete migration stop .",
    "the exponential fit has not been evaluated for this model .",
    "+    propagation of waves coming from the central zone of the disc has been observed , at least for the @xmath26 and @xmath45 models .",
    "some snapshots showing this phenomenon are plotted in figures [ wave_l18 ] and [ wave_l36 ] . the same is not clearly observed in the other models , the cause being probably the high angular momentum of particles . a strong sub - keplerian condition for injected particles",
    "makes them rapidly fall towards the centrifugal barrier , and the subsequent bouncing - back could be at the origin of these waves .",
    "details on this propagation of shock waves in systems with a central accreting object was described by @xcite and references therein .",
    "a proper combination of sub - keplerian gas flow and viscosity parameter values can create a complex shock structure with nearly periodical radial motions of the shock front .",
    "periods of quiet piling up of particles near and below the centrifugal barrier are followed by the development of a shock front propagating outwards . in low or no viscosity regimes ,",
    "the position of the shock front is generally closer to the central accreting object .",
    "together with the above specified simulations , we performed a numerical test with our code , without the planet and with an initially totally keplerian distribution of velocities .",
    "the aim of this test is to analyse the survival time of the keplerian kinematics before consistent radial perturbations comes out .",
    "results are shown in figure [ keplerian_breaking ] , where the ratio `` radial speed / keplerian speed '' is plotted as a function of the radial distance to the central star .",
    "four snapshots are provided at different times , the first at time zero , and the last at @xmath46 ( corresponding to three keplerian orbits at @xmath47 ) .",
    "a spontaneous breaking of the initially keplerian kinemetics is observed , due probably to the contribution of pressure forces and to the collisional nature of our model .",
    "in a standard disc model , the relation connecting the disc thickness h , the disc radius r is : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the sound velocity and @xmath50 is the keplerian velocity at the disc outer edge .",
    "such relation correlates the disc geometry to a tight keplerian kinematic condition . in our keplerian disc model ,",
    "the velocity of particles at the injectors positions is @xmath51 in the units specified in section [ models ] , @xmath52 being the sound speed , so that we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "generally this evaluation applies to a thin disc , where the hypothesis of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium is taken into account @xcite .",
    "if this relation is translated also to sub - keplerian modelling , it would give @xmath54 for @xmath55 respectively .",
    "however , although these results could give some indication , at least as a rough evaluation , these disc spreads are not strictly correct whenever turbulence and sub - keplerian conditions are taken into account .",
    "the results of this work deal with protoplanet migration in a protoplanetary accretion disc around a pre - main sequence star , according to the hypothesis that the accretion process is not strictly keplerian . the keplerian constraint is often used in computational models of accretion proto - planetary accretion discs on the basis of observational features that can be reproduced with keplerian discs .",
    "it is sustainable if pressure and other forces are not able to significantly modify an initially keplerian distribution of velocities .",
    "we decided to explore the consequences of the presence of sub - keplerian flows as a parametric study on the initial angular momentum , releasing the keplerian constraint .",
    "+ our models are technically considered as physically inviscid , since they are based on the euler equations .",
    "artificial viscosity @xcite is necessarily introduced in our models to resolve shocks numerically , to avoid spurious heating and to handle fluid discontinuities .",
    "artificial viscosity vanishes when the limit value of the particle interpolation domain goes to zero .",
    "the linear @xmath56 and quadratic @xmath57 artificial viscosity terms ( usually @xmath58 and sometimes , in some specific cases , @xmath59 ) are chosen to be 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the linear component of the artificial viscosity , in the continuum limit , yields a viscous shear force . @xcite and @xcite explicitly formulated such an artificial viscosity contribution in momentum and energy equations , founding an analogy between the shear viscosity generated by the linear artificial viscosity term and the well - known @xcite shear viscosity in the continuum limit . in the sph method ,",
    "the quadratic ( @xmath57 , von neumann - rychtmyer like viscosity ) artificial viscosity term is used in order to handle structures .",
    "an analytical formulation , describing the numerical artificial viscosity coefficient , is reported in @xcite : @xmath60 , where @xmath49 is the sound velocity .",
    "therefore , in our modelling , any radial transport process is due to the role of the artificial viscosity . in order to estimate",
    "what @xmath24 value the numerical viscosity refers to , we can use the equality ( see @xcite and references therein for a more detailed discussion of this point ) : @xmath61 using the above estimated @xmath62 values we obtain : @xmath63 for keplerian and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "+ in order to allow a comparison between the effects produced by our implementation of artificial viscosity and the effects produced by physical shear viscosity , we performed a test comparing a simulated spreading ring @xcite with its approximate analytical solution .",
    "as in the above specified papers we considered an initial ring of @xmath64 particles with a distribution of density given by the analytical solution obtained putting the dimensionless time @xmath65 @xcite equal to @xmath66 . the initial ring radius @xmath7 is chosen to be equal to the stellar radius , while the kinematic viscosity is estimated as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 was set equal to @xmath69 as specified by @xcite .",
    "+ graphs showing the results of this test , at various times ( specified by @xmath70 values ) are shown in figure [ ring_test ] , which can be directly compared to figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "beware that this comparison , while allowing to show the shear effects produced by artificial viscosity , has its limits . in @xcite",
    "the disc is totally pressure - less and viscosity is treated via the viscous stress tensor . in our case , even though we artificially removed the gas pressure , we could not remove the pressure contribution due to the artificial viscosity and we did not introduced a direct treatment of shear viscosity ( our code is based on the euler equations )",
    ". moreover , the relation [ alpha_ss ] links the artificial viscosity and the kinematic viscosity to the value of the speed of sound @xmath49 , so that the gas can not be considered pressure - less . the main difference between our test results and",
    "those obtained by @xcite is the absence , in our case , of spiral structures . + concerning the difference between the faster migration in our sub - keplerian models and slower migration in keplerian ones",
    ", we can notice that : in sub - keplerian models the most important contribution to downward migration seems to come from momentum transfer between the gas particles and the protoplanet ; the sub - keplerian @xmath71 value induces an average decrease of planet @xmath72 , until the accretion disc centrifugal barrier is reached ; an initially keplerian distribution of gas particles velocities , like in our keplerian models , makes this effect less important , particularly with the jovian planet .",
    "models @xmath73 and @xmath74 show in fact a slow outward migration , despite the opening of a density gap .",
    "this result is different from classical views on the subject , which connect the opening of a density gap to a viscosity driven downward migration ( type ii migration ) , but without physical viscosity ( our models ) the result can be different . + some people @xcite suggest a type iii migration mechanism , where the main migration `` engine '' is provided by material flowing through the co - orbital region . this material would change orbit ( and angular momentum ) while passing trough the co - orbital , exerting a torque onto the protoplanet .",
    "this torque can be evaluated trough momentum conservation .",
    "this effect might actually be present in our models , but it s not the main mechanism , at least in our sub - keplerian models . in our case ,",
    "momentum conservation is directly applied to correct the protoplanet kinematics when disc particles are captured by the planet .",
    "a rough estimate of the specific angular momentum change due to the capture of one disc particle can be done as follows : let @xmath75 , @xmath13 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the specific angular momentum and mass of the protoplanet and of the gas particle respectively ; angular momentum conservation after particle capture leads to @xmath78 for @xmath79 ; in our case ( planet at an initial distance of @xmath80 in a circular keplerian orbit ) @xmath81 ; referring to our @xmath82 model we have @xmath83 and @xmath45 , so that after a single capture @xmath84 .",
    "about @xmath0 particles are captured during our simulation in model @xmath82 before the angular momentum is reduced to about one half of the initial value ( not all of them will have preserved the @xmath45 before capture ) , so that this capture mechanism is perfectly able to account for our rapid migration . + in our keplerian models particle captures can both increase or decrease the protoplanet angular momentum , and a flow of particles through the co - orbital region is visible ( figure [ keplerian_disc_jovian ] ) , so type iii mechanism might play a role .",
    "notice however that the above specified flowing particles are moving towards smaller orbits , so they are mostly loosing angular momentum .",
    "this might actually be the reason for our slowly increasing angular momentum of the protoplanet in @xmath85 models .",
    "but , being particle captures present in all our models , we can not have pure type iii migration anyway .",
    "the results also lead our attention to the secondary role of the presence of a `` pseudo - atmosphere '' surrounding the protoplanets with the aim to discover whether such cumulative role could be also relevant .",
    "+ the impact of the eventual presence of a pseudo - atmosphere in the protoplanets is visible in some models , particularly those with the less massive protoplanets ( look at the difference between models @xmath44 and @xmath86 ) , but never appears crucial in determining the main results . the slightly faster migration rate shown by models without the pseudo - atmosphere was actually expected , because the pseudo - atmosphere adds a repulsive pressure interaction between the protoplanet and the gas , that should hinder gas particle capture by the protoplanet . since part of the migration effect in our models is due to momentum transfer between the infalling particles and the protoplanets when",
    "the former are captured , a lower capture rate might bring a lower migration rate .",
    "+ particularly interesting is the result reported by the @xmath87 models , where the radial migration breaks down close to @xmath88 stellar radii , for @xmath89 respectively .",
    "we believe that this effect is mainly due to the interaction of the protoplanet with the propagation of outward gas waves coming from inner zones ( figures [ wave_l18]-[wave_l36 ] ) , where the centrifugal barrier is located in our sub - keplerian models .",
    "these results show that , despite the sub - keplerian and more realistic conditions , planetary migration could even halt .",
    "subsequent disc extinction could freeze the protoplanet orbital parameters .",
    "of course , due to a much higher inertia , jovian planets evolve much more slowly .",
    "+ an analytical expression giving us an idea of the protoplanet evolution , as a function of the model initial conditions , is expressed by the specific angular momentum fit equations [ exp_template]-[linear_template ] and by their temporal first derivatives .",
    "+ even if it is not the main topic of this paper , let s draw some comments on eccentricity behaviour shown in the bottom rectangles of figures [ l18_a_b]-[keplerian_c_d ] . for jupiter - like planets",
    "the orbits remain almost circular , with values around @xmath90 , while for earth - like planets some eccentricity enhancing effect is visible in sub - keplerian models , but the behaviour is quite complex and a more stable value is obtained in late migration phases , with values in the @xmath91 range . + for a comparison with other results we refer to the study performed by @xcite since they used sph to simulate accretion disc hydrodynamics , even if some differences have to be remarked : first , they use a different numerical method to avoid particle mutual penetration , since they rely on xsph with a bulk viscosity contribution to the viscous stress tensor ; second , they simulate physical viscous discs according to @xcite prescription whilst our discs are inviscid ; third , they use an isothermal equation of state whilst we rely on a classical ideal gas equation with variable thermal energy per unit mass ; fourth , their initial velocity distribution is keplerian .",
    "they estimate a decrease of the planet distance from the the star of about 1 au ( from 5.2 au to 4.1 au ) in about 30000 years for a jovian planet , which brings to a rate of @xmath92 .",
    "they also conclude that migration is braked by disc mass loss , which means a lowering of the disc density and of the gravitational interaction .",
    "+ inserting in our dimensionless model the following reference physical units : central star mass @xmath93 ; stellar radius from typical t - tauri stars @xcite @xmath94 ; the basic unit for time is @xmath95 .",
    "our sub - keplerian models with @xmath89 give then migration rates of @xmath96 respectively .",
    "we notice that our @xmath27 ( the less sub - keplerian model ) migration rate is similar to the average migration rate obtained by @xcite , even if our starting distance is about @xmath97 with the above specified choices for physical units .",
    "more important , the braking effect is due , in our simulations , to a completely different mechanism based on turbulence , outward propagation of bouncing waves and changing of the average momentum transferred to the planet during gas particle captures , and we do not observe a significant lowering of the disc density .",

    "<S> current theories on planetary formation establish that giant planet formation should be contextual to their quick migration towards the central star due to the protoplanets - disc interactions on a timescale of the order of @xmath0 years , for objects of nearly 10 terrestrial masses . </S>",
    "<S> such a timescale should be smaller by an order of magnitude than that of gas accretion onto the protoplanet during the hierarchical growing - up of protoplanets by collisions with other minor objects . </S>",
    "<S> these arguments have recently been analysed using n - body and/or fluid - dynamics codes or a mixing of them . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> inviscid 2d simulations are performed , using the sph method , to study the migration of one protoplanet , to evaluate the effectiveness of the accretion disc in the protoplanet dragging towards the central star , as a function of the mass of the planet itself , of disc tangential kinematics . to this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> the sph scheme is considered suitable to study the roles of turbulence , kinematic and boundary conditions , due to its intrinsic advective turbulence , especially in 2d and in 3d codes . </S>",
    "<S> simulations are performed both in disc sub - keplerian and in keplerian kinematic conditions as a parameter study of protoplanetary migration if moderate and consistent deviations from keplerian kinematics occur . </S>",
    "<S> our results show migration times of a few orbital periods for earth - like planets in sub - keplerian conditions , while for jupiter - like planets estimates give that about @xmath1 orbital periods are needed to half the orbital size . </S>",
    "<S> timescales of planet migration are strongly dependent on the relative position of the planet with respect to the shock region near the centrifugal barrier of the disc flow .    </S>",
