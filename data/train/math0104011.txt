    "it has undoubtedly been observed many times that the fibonacci sequence , when run backwards as well as forwards from its initial conditions , yields a doubly - infinite sequence that is symmetrical modulo some minus - signs : @xmath7 we will see that this is just one instance of a more general phenomenon involving domino tilings of rectangles .",
    "for positive integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 , let @xmath0 denote the number of ways to cover an @xmath1-by-@xmath2 rectangle with 1-by-2 rectangles ( `` dominos '' ) with pairwise disjoint interiors .",
    "when @xmath8 , the values @xmath0 form the fibonacci sequence ; more generally , for each fixed @xmath1 , the values of @xmath0 form a sequence satisfying a higher - order linear recurrence relation ( see section [ sec - recur ] for an explanation of why such a recurrence relation must exist ) .",
    "these recurrences allow one to extrapolate @xmath0 to negative values of @xmath2 in a natural way , for each fixed positive integer @xmath1 .",
    "there are in fact infinitely many recurrences one could employ ; but , as section [ sec - recur ] explains , the extrapolated values of @xmath0 do not depend on which of the recurrence relations is used .",
    "one finds that as long as @xmath1 is not congruent to 2 ( mod 4 ) , the sequence of values @xmath0 ( with @xmath2 varying over the positive and negative integers ) exhibits palindromicity : @xmath9 when @xmath1 is congruent to 2 ( mod 4 ) , a modified version of this holds : @xmath10    these properties of the sequence of values @xmath0 can also be expressed in terms of the generating function @xmath11 , with @xmath12 taken to be 1 .",
    "this generating function is a rational function of @xmath13 , as a consequence of the recurrence relation governing the values @xmath0 .",
    "denote this rational function by @xmath14 .",
    "note that the polynomial @xmath15 encodes the recurrence relation that governs the sequence of coefficients @xmath0 , at least eventually ; if the degree of @xmath16 is less than the degree of @xmath15 , then the recurrence relation applies to all the coefficients of the generating function , not just ones with @xmath2 sufficiently large .",
    "stanley showed @xcite ( see parts ( d ) and ( e ) of his main theorem ) that for @xmath17 , the degree of @xmath18 is 2 more than the degree of @xmath19 , @xmath20 when @xmath5 ( mod 4 ) and @xmath21 when @xmath22 ( mod 4 ) .",
    "these reciprocity relations , first observed empirically by klarner and pollack @xcite , can be shown to be equivalent to the claims made earlier about the extrapolated values of @xmath0 .",
    "stanley s proof makes use of algebraic methods ; in particular , it relies upon formulas proved by kasteleyn @xcite and temperley and fisher @xcite that express @xmath0 in terms of complex roots of unity ( or , if one prefers , trigonometric functions ) .",
    "i will present a combinatorial way of thinking about the two - sided infinite sequence @xmath23 .",
    "all features of the reciprocity relation  including the factor @xmath24  will have direct combinatorial interpretations .",
    "moreover , the method used here can also be used to demonstrate similar reciprocity phenomena for three- and higher - dimensional analogues of domino tiling .",
    "for instance , if @xmath25 denotes the number of ways to tile a @xmath26-by-@xmath1-by-@xmath2 box with 1-by-1-by-2 blocks ( in any orientation ) , then @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is obtained by taking the recurrence relation for @xmath25 ( with @xmath29 fixed and @xmath2 varying ) and running it backward .",
    "such higher - dimensional tiling problems are not amenable to stanley s method , since the formulas of kasteleyn and temperley and fisher do not extend beyond the two - dimensional setting .",
    "instead of using domino - tilings , we will use an equivalent mathematical model : perfect matchings of grid - graphs , also known as dimer covers or dimer configurations .",

    "the entry associated with @xmath100 satisfies this recurrence .",
    "for instance , with @xmath101 , @xmath93 is the 4-by-4 matrix @xmath102 where rows and columns are indexed in the order @xmath103 .",
    "the characteristic polynomial of this matrix is @xmath104 , so the one - sided sequence of numbers @xmath105 ( with @xmath2 going from 1 to @xmath106 ) must satisfy the recurrence @xmath107 , regardless of the nature of the width-@xmath1 signed graph @xmath81 .",
    "i now claim that the two - sided sequence of numbers @xmath108 ( with @xmath2 going from @xmath109 to @xmath106 ) satisfies this same recurrence relation .",
    "if we take @xmath110 with @xmath111 large , and use the fact that @xmath112 , we see that if we take the doubly - infinite sequence @xmath113 and start it at @xmath114 , we get a singly - infinite sequence that ( as we have shown ) must satisfy the cayley - hamilton recurrence .",
    "since @xmath111 was arbitrary , the two - sided infinite sequence of @xmath108 s satisfies the cayley - hamilton recurrence as well .",
    "having constructed one recurrence relation satisfied by the doubly - infinite sequence @xmath115 , or equivalently , one linear operator @xmath116 that annihilates @xmath117 , we must now consider others .",
    "could there be a linear operator @xmath118 that annihilates the singly - infinite sequence @xmath119 but not the doubly - infinite sequence @xmath117 ?",
    "if so , then @xmath118 would yield a different extrapolation of @xmath0 to negative values of @xmath2 than @xmath116 would .    to show that no such operator @xmath118 exists , note that @xmath120 annihilates @xmath117 . since @xmath121 , @xmath118 must send @xmath117 into something annihilated by @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath118 does not itself annihilate @xmath117 , then @xmath118 sends @xmath117 into some other sequence that vanishes for all sufficiently large indices but does not vanish for all indices .",
    "it is easy to show that such a sequence can not be annihilated by @xmath116 or indeed by any linear operator with constant coefficients .",
    "the above arguments show that the numbers @xmath0 , defined for non - positive values of @xmath2 as above , are the unique way to extrapolate so that a linear recurrence is satisfied .",
    "with all the ingredients in place , we can now give a very simple explanation of the reciprocity relation for domino tilings of rectangles of fixed width .",
    "for concreteness , we start with the special case @xmath122 . referring to figure 2",
    ", we see that every matching of @xmath38 must contain the two leftmost horizontal edges and the two rightmost horizontal edges .",
    "if we remove these edges from the graph ( and the vertices incident with those edges , and the edges incident with those vertices ) , we get a copy of @xmath123 in which the vertical edges have sign 1 .",
    "since every matching of @xmath123 has an odd number of vertical edges , we see that @xmath124 .",
    "more generally , when @xmath2 is positive , every matching of @xmath125 must contain the @xmath1 leftmost horizontal edges and the @xmath1 rightmost horizontal edges . removing these edges ( and concomitant vertices and edges )",
    "leaves a copy of @xmath39 in which the vertical edges have sign 1 .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that every domino - tiling of a rectangle ( or indeed more general regions ) can be obtained from every other by means of moves in which a 2-by-2 block of horizontal dominos is rotated to give a 2-by-2 block of vertical dominos , or vice versa . since moves of this kind do not affect the parity of the number of vertical dominos ( or , in our terms , the parity of the number of vertical edges in a matching ) , we know that that all the signed matchings of our modified version of @xmath39 carry the same sign ; it remains to determine what this sign is .    if one is willing to appeal to the invariance - of - parity result mentioned in the preceding paragraph , it is simple to evaluate the common sign of all the matchings by considering the all - horizontal matching or the all - vertical matching .",
    "but in the interests of making the article self - contained , i give a direct argument ( of a fairly standard kind ) .",
    "say we have a matching of @xmath39 that involves @xmath126 vertical edges joining row @xmath90 and row @xmath127 , for @xmath90 ranging from 1 to @xmath128 .",
    "when these edges and their vertices are removed from the graph , along with all other edges joining row @xmath90 and row @xmath127 , our graph splits into two subgraphs , each of which must have an even number of vertices ( since we are assuming that we have a matching ) .",
    "hence @xmath129 and @xmath130 must be even . using the congruence @xmath131 ( mod 2 ) , we find that @xmath132 , the number of vertical edges , must be congruent to @xmath133 ( mod 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is congruent to 0 or 1 ( mod 4 ) , @xmath134 is even , so the number of vertical edges is even .",
    "if @xmath1 is congruent to 3 ( mod 4 ) , then ( in order for a matching to exist ) @xmath2 must be even , so that @xmath135 is even .",
    "however , if @xmath1 is congruent to 2 ( mod 4 ) , then @xmath134 is odd , so that @xmath135 is even or odd according to the parity of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , if we define @xmath24 to be @xmath35 when @xmath1 is congruent to 2 ( mod 4 ) and @xmath2 is odd , and @xmath34 otherwise , we have @xmath136 as claimed .",
    "the definition of @xmath39 for @xmath137 arose not by ad hoc insight but by a particular vision of combinatorics as a specialized form of algebra . under this vision ,",
    "a collection of combinatorial objects ought to be represented by a multivariate polynomial whose coefficients are all equal to 1 , where the individual terms represent the combinatorial objects themselves in some fashion .    in the case of matchings of @xmath138 with @xmath46",
    ", we assign a formal variable ( or `` weight '' ) to each edge , define the weight of a matching as the product of the weights of its constituent edges , and define the polynomial @xmath139 as the sum of the weights of all the matchings .",
    "this is a polynomial in which every coefficient equals 1 , and in which the constituent monomials encode the respective matchings of the graph .",
    "if we think of @xmath138 as being embedded in @xmath140 as the induced subgraph on the leftmost @xmath2 columns , we find that the edge - variables occurring in @xmath141 form a subset of the edge - variables occurring in @xmath142 , and that indeed , there is a recurrence expressing @xmath142 in terms of @xmath141 and @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the weight of the rightmost vertical edge of @xmath140 and @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the weights of the rightmost horizontal edges of @xmath140 .",
    "we can run this recurrence backward , obtaining in succession some rational functions of the variables @xmath148 with @xmath2 negative .",
    "these rational functions are in fact laurent polynomials ; moreover , all the coefficients of these laurent polynomials are @xmath149 . just as the monomials of @xmath141 with @xmath46 encode the matchings of @xmath138 , one might assume that the monomials in the extrapolated laurent polynomials `` @xmath141 '' with @xmath47 encode combinatorial objects that will yield a combinatorial interpretation of the extrapolated values @xmath150 with @xmath47 .",
    "the monomials lead one to matchings of the graphs @xmath138 with @xmath137 , and once one has this signed - matching model , the idea is readily extended to @xmath0 for all @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the reciprocity theorem satisfied by the laurent polynomials @xmath139 is a bit more complicated than the reciprocity theorem satisfied by the numbers @xmath0 ; in addition to the sign - factor @xmath24 , there is also a monomial factor involving the variables . a comprehensive reciprocity theorem for domino tilings of rectangles would take this into account .",
    "i intend to write a longer article that treats these issues , and also applies them to other models , such as matchings of honeycomb hexagons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "i expect that algebraic recurrences for sequences of laurent polynomials will also shed light on the issues raised in problem 32 ( the last problem ) in @xcite .",
