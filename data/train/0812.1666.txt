    "though yet to be seen in experiments , extra dimensions have been around in theoretical constructs for almost a century now .",
    "the fact that such a seemingly exotic idea has survived for so long seems to make us feel that there is bound to be some amount of advantage in having them .",
    "the advantage stems from several directions .",
    "for instance , one may ask  _ why four dimensions ? _  a question to which one really does not have an answer . or , while making models of unification ( such as superstrings @xcite ) one ends up with a need of more dimensions and the subsequent need for compactification .",
    "more recently , we have seen how the age - old problem the hierarchy problem  can be solved ( obviously not uniquely ) with extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the most popular among today s models is the one we mentioned at the end in the last paragraph the so - called warped braneworld or randall - sundrum ( referred henceforth as rs ) model .",
    "this model assumes a curved spacetime ( the bulk ) in five dimensions . the four dimensional piece however , depends on the extra dimension , a feature unique for this class of models ( different from the usual kaluza ",
    "klein @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in such a model we have a metric ansatz : @xmath0 the @xmath1 ( say @xmath2 ) section is a four dimensional minkowski space scaled by the factor @xmath3 .",
    "but such a metric ansatz is toy .",
    "this is because the metric on the @xmath4 constant surface must necessarily be cosmological , in order to tally with the universe .",
    "further , there is no reason for us to assume @xmath5 to be a constant .",
    "it could be a function of space and time .",
    "such a spacetime dependence effectively makes the scale of the extra dimension , a field , commonly known today as the radion .",
    "however , here , we restrict ourselves to only a temporal dependence of @xmath5 . together , these two modifications , i.e. having a cosmological on - brane metric and a time dependent extra dimensional scale drive us towards a more realistic braneworld model",
    ".    however , the generalisation of the simple rs line element to the more complicated one ( i.e. with a cosmological scale factor and a time dependent extra dimensional factor ) makes life difficult for the general relativist to find meaningful exact solutions .",
    "several attempts have been made so far .",
    "notable among them are discussed in @xcite .",
    "further , the existence of a time dependent extra dimension in an unwarped scenario has been investigated with the aim of finding out whether such a time dependence can drive an accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "cosmological applications including implications for the cmb anisotropies @xcite and bbn nucleosynthesis @xcite have been analysed in recent times . on the other front , warped cosmological braneworlds with a constant scale for the extra dimension",
    "have been studied extensively @xcite ever since the rs model came into existence .",
    "our intentions in the investigations here , is to first figure out whether such solutions ( one can call them generalised brane - bulk systems ) exist and , if they do , how do the matter fields , spacetime geometry behave .",
    "our programme is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we write down the field equations",
    ". then we move on to the issue of energy conditions and try to figure out , if it is possible to have viable forms for the unknown metric functions , which satisfy them . then",
    ", we look at the possibilities of solutions with matter fields . first , we assume a non  singular bulk with an exponential warp factor and discuss the solution space for a specific equation of state .",
    "thereafter , we discuss three cases with different types of scalar field actions  ordinary and phantom scalar , brans ",
    "dicke scalar and dilaton .",
    "we then return to a discussion on the issue of energy conditions for our exact solutions .",
    "finally , we discuss the placing of branes using the junction conditions and the question of resolution of bulk singularities .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary and some general remarks .",
    "a general warped line element in five dimensions is given as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 can , in principle be any metric and @xmath8 can be a function of space , time and @xmath9 , not necessarily separable .",
    "the line element we choose to work with is as follows :    @xmath10 + \\eta^2 ( t ) d\\sigma^2 \\label{eq : metric}\\ ] ]    in the above , we have chosen a cosmological line element on the @xmath1 hypersurface .",
    "@xmath11 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath12 correspond to the usual friedmann ",
    "robertson  walker ( frw ) metric with spacelike sections of zero ( @xmath13 ) , positive ( @xmath14 ) and negative ( @xmath15 ) curvatures respectively . as defined before , @xmath16 is the warp factor .",
    "the domain of @xmath9 , which is the extra dimension , could be @xmath17 though , as we shall see later , we may need to consider finite or semi - infinite domains and/or introduce additional branes in order to avoid inevitable bulk singularities which appear in most of our solutions .",
    "however , unlike the randall - sundrum model we now have a time - dependent function @xmath18 associated with the extra dimension . in general , such a function , when it is dependent on all the four coordinates @xmath19 , is known as the _ radion _ field .",
    "it measures the scale of the extra dimension at different spatial and temporal locations in the four dimensional world .",
    "in the two - brane rs1 picture , this quantity @xmath20 is known to be the inter - brane distance and must have a stable value in order to make sure that the branes do not collapse on to each other .",
    "note that in the rs model we always had @xmath18 as a constant",
    ".    it might be useful at this stage to find out what our expectations are about the nature of the unknown functions @xmath21 , @xmath11 and @xmath18 . guided by the rs solution , we expect @xmath21 to be such that the bulk line element is nonsingular w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath9 coordinate , i.e. there are no bulk singularities .",
    "this , as we will see , is largely impossible unless we postulate it to be so . on the other hand , the usual singularity in cosmological time t ( or , conformal time )",
    "should exist .",
    "in other words , it is reasonable to assume a big  bang singularity in the four dimensional world where @xmath11 goes to zero at some time @xmath22 but at all spatial positions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 as well as @xmath9 .",
    "secondly , we would like to have a solution where , following our current understanding of cosmology , we have an expanding universe .",
    "this will imply @xmath11 to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath22 which may have a deceleration or an acceleration ( negative or positive second derivatives , respectively ) .",
    "on the other hand , we would not like to have a large scale for the extra dimension today , which leads to the choice that @xmath26 should be monotonically decreasing in time , but never becoming zero at any finite time .",
    "this choice is motivated from old ideas in kaluza ",
    "klein cosmology where , of course extra dimensions are always compact .",
    "in fact , a growing extra dimension is still fine if it stabilises to a certain value at later times .",
    "but , as we will see , the solutions found are essentially of power law type which , if growing , will keep growing forever .",
    "thus , we choose the extra dimension scale to be of the decaying type .",
    "we mention that we never use the above choices as constraints while solving the einstein equations .",
    "the above choices merely imply that we _ prefer _ to have an expanding four dimensional universe with a non - compact but shrinking ( in time ) extra dimensional scale .",
    "one may argue , following the example in @xcite , that an increasing @xmath18 is an acceptable model essentially because the bulk solution can be transformed to a static , conformally flat metric by a suitable coordinate transformation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , a growing extra dimensional scale is permissible because it corresponds to the motion of the brane ( through its embedding ) in a static bulk .",
    "however , a coordinate transformation of the type used in @xcite seems possible only if the weyl tensor for the bulk geometry vanishes .",
    "one can check that , for the metric ansatz [ eq : metric ] ( with @xmath27 ) , all the components of the weyl tensor vanish if the following constraint is satisfied , @xmath28 for solutions of power law type , we may choose , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "[ eq : weyl_constraint ] then implies @xmath31 @xmath32 means a trivial solution which results in the same functional form for both the scale factors and @xmath33 is essentially what was found in @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that , for the scale factors obtained as solutions in our examples , the above constraint relation does not hold and thus , the bulk geometries are not conformally flat .",
    "furthermore , following the discussion in @xcite , a moving brane arises when we make a gauge choice in which the metric on the @xmath34 section is manifestly conformally flat .",
    "fixing the brane implies that we do not retain the full gauge freedom .",
    "thus , the growing / decaying nature of the extra dimension is linked with the motion of the brane in the bulk . by making a choice of decaying extra dimensions",
    ", we therefore , do not eliminate the possibility of viable models with growing extra dimensions though our preference ( and the obtained solutions ) is based on some logic essentially linked with old kaluza ",
    "klein ideas and the issue of a stabilised extra dimensional scale at later times .",
    "we mention that such solutions with a decaying extra dimensional scale have been discussed earlier , for example in @xcite itself .",
    "thus , our central question now is : do the einstein field equations with a matter source have such kind of solution that we seek ? to answer this query , we must write down these equations .",
    "we first choose to write down the einstein tensor and perform our analysis by assuming it to be the _ required _ stress energy for specific choices of the unknown functions .",
    "this , in the older literature of general relativity is known as synge s _ g - method _ @xcite .",
    "the other way , is to actually solve the einstein s equations with some specific choices of matter stress energy ( eg . different types of scalar fields residing in the bulk )  this , following synge is the _ t - method_.    the nonzero components of einstein tensor ( in the frame basis ) for the metric [ eq : metric ] with @xmath27 ( i.e. a spatially flat cosmological brane ) are , @xmath35 where , in the above , @xmath36 refers @xmath37 , the three spatial indices in the 4d frw metric .",
    "a dot denotes differentiation w.r.t time while a prime indicates differentiation w.r.t . @xmath9 .    defining new variables , @xmath38 , @xmath39",
    ", we have , @xmath40    some interesting features in the structure of these equations may be noted here .    *",
    "the presence of the flux term emerging out of @xmath41 which is zero only when @xmath42 is zero and/or when the geometry is unwarped ( i.e. @xmath43 is a constant ) . * the separability of functions of time and @xmath9 which enables us to make an attempt towards constructing solutions by equating coefficients of @xmath44 and @xmath45 on both sides of the einstein s equations with some matter source . * a vacuum solution ( @xmath46 ) turns out to be either un - warped or with a time independent extra dimension .",
    "also , with a bulk cosmological constant , ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , a non - trivial solution can not be found .",
    "given the above expressions for the einstein tensors , we can now ask the question : _ is it possible to have geometries , i.e. specific functional forms of @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 , with matter satisfying the weak or null energy conditions ? _ to do this analysis we need to know about the energy conditions in a bit more detail , largely because certain non  trivialities arise because of a non ",
    "zero @xmath41 term ( equivalently , a non",
    " zero @xmath48 must also be there ) being present .",
    "the weak energy condition is given by , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a nonspacelike vector and a similar inequality defines then null energy condition if @xmath50 is a null vector .",
    "one can write down the energy conditions in terms of the eigenvalues of the energy - momentum tensor ( which must be real ) . if @xmath51 denotes the eigenvalue corresponding to the timelike eigenvector , the weak energy condition is equivalent to the following simple relations amongst the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 in effect , we find the inequalities by diagonalising the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the eigenvalues of the energy - momentum tensor are the roots of the equation @xmath53 which reduces to , @xmath54 where , @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 here , and henceforth , we shall absorb the factor @xmath59 in the einstein equation @xmath60 through appropriate scaling redefinitions .",
    "the five eigenvalues from eq .",
    "[ eq : eigen ] assume the following forms , @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 the fact that the above eigenvalues have to be real , leads to the following requirment @xmath64 this may restrict the allowed domains of @xmath22 and @xmath9 .",
    "as the eigenvector corresponding for the eigenvalue @xmath51 is timelike or null , the effective inequalities for weak energy condition turns out to be @xcite , @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67    fig.[fig : plot1 ] shows status of the above three inequalities for two models in the two columns , @xmath68 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath9 run from @xmath69 to @xmath70 and @xmath71 to @xmath70 respectively ) with @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively ( variation of @xmath18 with two different values of @xmath74 is shown in fig.[fig : eta ] ) .",

    "[ eq : test1 ] .",
    "we find that for the above two models , all the inequalities are satisfied at least with the specific choices of parameters we have made .",
    "it has been checked that these inequalities can be satisfied in the presence of a decaying warp factor . however , for a growing warp factor ( i.e. for a negative @xmath79 ) the inequalities are violated at least in some spacetime region .",
    "in this section , we discuss possible exact solutions in the bulk .",
    "we first assume an exponential warp factor and discuss some specific consequences for a given equation of state .",
    "in subsequent sub  sections , we look at exact solutions with different types of scalar fields  an ordinary massless scalar , the brans - dicke scalar and finally a dilatonic scalar .      in the randall - sundrum scenario ,",
    "the warp factor is of the form @xmath80 . using the functional form @xmath81 ( or @xmath82 ) and restricting ourselves to the @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) region of the extra dimension",

    "it is difficult to make any conclusive comments , analytically , on the behaviour of phase space trajectories near those points , because such borderline cases are very sensitive to nonlinear terms in the equations .",
    "but the phase portrait ( fig.[fig : solspace ] ) indeed confirms our conclusions about the nature of the fixed points .",
    "note that , the ( @xmath96 ) point in the phase space is irrelevant as the jacobian itself becomes singular and therefore it does not fall in any category of fixed points . from a physical point of view , the origin represents a static universe .",
    "we will see that no trajectory reaches that state in finite time .",
    "this provides a justification for the origin not representing a viable solution .",

    "the junction conditions for the dilaton case can be obtained by using @xmath232 and a redefinition of the @xmath25 field in the above analysis for the brans  dicke scalar .      it may be noted that all our solutions ( except those discussed under the section on an exponential rs type warp factor ) have bulk singularities , apart from the usual big - bang cosmological singularity in time .",
    "the latter is inevitable and expected while the former needs better understanding .",
    "the main question we need to address is  how do we manage to use a spacetime with a bulk singularity as a model for our bulk five dimensional geometry ? there are ways to do this .",
    "one possible resolution of the singularities is done by putting branes at the locations of the singularities .",
    "for example , let us take , in the case of solutions with a bulk dilaton field , the two different solutions valid in two different regions ( except the points where singularities occur ) , i. e. @xmath291 where @xmath2 is located somewhere between @xmath292 and @xmath293",
    ". then continuity at @xmath2 implies , @xmath294 now this is a good bulk solution except at points @xmath292 and @xmath293 . to resolve these singularities",
    "we can put two branes at @xmath292 and @xmath293 and another brane at @xmath2 and make their total contribution to bulk vacuum energy vanish @xcite ( as we do not have any bulk cosmological constant ) .",
    "this will be equivalent to putting delta - function source terms in the bulk lagrangian . in effect , those singularities in bulk solutions actually provide us with places for the 3branes , one of which can be chosen to be the standard model brane we live in .",
    "finally , we list below , systematically , the conclusions obtained in this investigation .",
    "* we start out by writing down the energy condition inequalities using the einstein tensor components ( which have a nonzero @xmath41 ) .",
    "these inequalities are first checked for typical choices for the various metric functions @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "we demonstrate that there exist viable models ( following the criteria listed in the introduction ) which satisfy the energy conditions .",
    "* we also find exact solutions with matter sources of various kinds .",
    "to begin with , we look at possible matter sources that may arise if we assume an exponential ( in @xmath9 ) warp factor and some other typical constraints on matter stress energy . the solution space for @xmath295 $ ]",
    "is analysed using a dynamical systems approach .",
    "subsequently , we look at solutions with various types of scalar fields as sources  eg . bulk normal scalar , the brans - dicke scalar and the dilaton scalar . in our approach to obtaining solutions we exploit the known fact that with a conformally related metric and a redefined scalar one can convert bd theory into canonical einstein gravity coupled to a scalar .",
    "analytic solutions are written down and the various possibilities that arise are outlined . in the case with a brans - dicke scalar and matter in the bulk",
    ", it is observed that , for traceless matter energy momentum exact and viable analytical solutions can be found with decaying or growing warp factors as well as decelerating / accelerating @xmath11 .",
    "we note that in the case of the dilaton we can have decaying as well as growing warp factor solutions too .",
    "we are also able to find desirable solutions with growing @xmath11 and decaying @xmath18 in several of our examples . *",
    "we check the energy conditions , the nature of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath18 and figure out whether an obtained solution is desirable or not .",
    "the details are tabulated in one of the columns in the table commenting on the desirability of the solution .",
    "we do find several classes of desirable solutions , which satisfy our requirements and the energy conditions .",
    "* finally , we outline how one can place a brane in the above bulk spacetimes by using the junction conditions .",
    "we also briefly discuss a way to resolve the bulk singularities using standard techniques .",
    "with three different functions appearing in the line element , it is always very difficult to find exact solutions .",
    "that we have found some is indeed encouraging .",
    "we hope to use these solutions in actual brane cosmological scenarios and arrive at relevant conclusions by making use of existing observational data on supernova and cmb anisotropies .",
    "we would also like to extend our results to other types of stress energy expressions .",
    "a disturbing aspect of our solutions is that they are singular in the bulk , though we do provide ways of resolving them .",
    "it remains to be seen whether we can find newer solutions ( a ) which are not necessarily of a power law type , ( b ) which have , in appropriate limits , both deceleration and acceleration , ( c ) which have a decaying extra dimension stabilisable to a finite value and ( d ) where the bulk warp factor gives rise to a non - singular bulk metric , similar to rs .",
    "in essence , an appropriate combination of different bulk fields , with some dominating over the others in specific time intervals , will then be able to generate the expansion history ( with proper decelerating and accelerating phase ) , of our universe on the brane .",
