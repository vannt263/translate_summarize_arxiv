    "when it comes to the design of signal processing systems , it has been recently understood that a / d conversion forms a bottleneck at the receiver with respect to its power consumption and hardware complexity @xcite .",
    "therefore , in contrast to classical works on hard - limiting which where aiming at the minimization of the digital processing complexity @xcite , today the topic of @xmath0-bit quantization has found a vital revival due the necessity of reducing the analog sensing complexity @xcite-@xcite . this shift of attention to the analog sensor front - end is a consequence of moore s law .",
    "while in the last four decades the computational capability per integrated circuit has approximately doubled every two years , the technological progress with respect to analog sensor hardware is much slower .",
    "therefore , in the last years the design of receivers with low - complexity @xmath0-bit a / d conversion has been emphasized within the signal processing and communication community in order to meet the requirements of future wireless systems and standards which feature high signal bandwidth @xcite and massive antenna arrays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although @xmath0-bit a / d conversion at the receiver is usually associated with a performance loss of more than @xmath2 db @xcite , in this work we show that trading the resolution for a moderately higher sampling rate allows to design @xmath0-bit systems which outperform this classical benchmark for specific signal processing tasks . obtaining this result",
    "requires to analyze the estimation accuracy with hard - limited gaussian signal models featuring noise correlation . for such models",
    "the exact analytic representation of the likelihood function is an open mathematical problem @xcite .",
    "here we circumvent this obstacle by a lower bound for the fisher information measure @xcite @xcite , resulting in a conservative approximation of the classical cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) @xcite .",
    "based on it , we visualize the asymptotic toa estimation performance which can be achieved in different snr scenarios with measurement data from hard - limiting receive sensors .",
    "note that toa estimation is a fundamental channel estimation problem with application in radar @xcite , radio - based positioning and synchronization @xcite .",
    "we assume a real - valued analog receive signal of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 being a periodic pilot signal of structure @xmath5_{(1+\\operatorname{mod}(k , m ) ) } \\breve{g}(t - kt_c),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a binary sequence with @xmath7 elements and a chip frequency @xmath8 .",
