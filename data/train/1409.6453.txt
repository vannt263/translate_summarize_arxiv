    "this equation arises in the study of modulational stability of small amplitude nearly harmonic waves in nonlinear dispersive systems @xcite . in this context ,",
    "monochromatic waves of the original system correspond to spatially homogeneous solutions of the cubic nls equation ( [ nls ] ) of the form @xmath3 , where the positive parameter @xmath4 can be taken equal to one without loss of generality , due to scaling invariance . according to the famous lighthill criterion ,",
    "these plane waves are spectrally stable with respect to sideband perturbations @xcite , because the nonlinearity in ( [ nls ] ) is defocusing . moreover , using energy methods , it can be shown that plane waves are also orbitally stable under perturbations in @xmath5 ( * ? ? ?",

    "a complete list of all bounded solutions of the second - order equation ( [ wave ] ) is known , see @xcite .",
    "most of them are quasi - periodic in the sense that @xmath10 for some real - valued functions @xmath11 such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are periodic with the same period @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding solutions of the cubic nls equation ( [ nls ] ) are usually called `` periodic waves '' , although strictly speaking they are not periodic functions of @xmath15 in general .",
    "in addition , the second - order equation ( [ wave ] ) has nonperiodic solutions such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 converge to a limit as @xmath16 ; these correspond to `` dark solitons '' of the cubic nls equation . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on real - valued solutions of the second - order equation ( [ wave ] ) , which form a one - parameter family of periodic waves ( often referred to as `` cnoidal waves '' ) .",
    "several recent works addressed the stability of periodic waves for the cubic nls equation ( [ nls ] ) . using the energy method , it was shown in @xcite that periodic waves are orbitally stable within a class of solutions which have the same periodicity properties as the wave itself .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is @xmath20-periodic , the wave @xmath21 is orbitally stable among solutions of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . here",
    "the orbit is defined with respect to translations in space and rotations of the complex phase .",
    "the proof follows the general strategy proposed in @xcite and relies on the fact that the periodic wave is a constrained minimizer of the energy @xmath24 { \\,\\mathrm{d}}x,\\ ] ] subject to fixed values of the charge @xmath25 and the momentum @xmath26 given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider the more general case of `` subharmonic perturbations '' , which correspond to @xmath29 for some integer @xmath30 , then the second variation of @xmath31 at @xmath32 with @xmath33 contains additional negative eigenvalues , which can not be eliminated by restricting the energy to the submanifold where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constant .    generally speaking , in such an unfavorable energy configuration , there is no chance to establish orbital stability using the standard energy method @xcite .",
    "however , the cubic defocusing nls equation can ( at least formally ) be integrated using the inverse scattering transform method , and it admits therefore a countable sequence of independent conserved quantities .",
    "for instance , one can verify directly or with an algorithmic computation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) for a review of such techniques ) that the higher - order functional @xmath34 { \\,\\mathrm{d}}x,\\ ] ] is also invariant under the time evolution defined by ( [ nls ] ) .",
    "these additional properties can be invoked to rescue the stability analysis of periodic waves . indeed , using the eigenfunctions of lax operators arising in the inverse scattering method , a complete set of floquet  bloch eigenfunctions satisfying the linearization of the cubic nls equation ( [ nls ] ) at the periodic wave with profile",
    "@xmath32 has been constructed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite that an appropriate linear combination of the energy @xmath31 , the charge @xmath25 , the momentum @xmath26 , and the higher order quantity @xmath35 produces a functional for which the periodic wave with profile @xmath32 is a strict local minimizer , up to symmetries .",
    "this result holds for @xmath36 , for any @xmath37 , where @xmath20 is the period of @xmath38 .",
    "this easily implies that the periodic wave with profile @xmath32 is orbitally stable with respect to subharmonic perturbations .    the proof given in @xcite that any periodic wave can be characterized as a local minimizer of a suitable higher - order conserved quantity is not direct .",
    "indeed , the authors prove the positivity of the second variation at the periodic wave by evaluating the corresponding quadratic form on the basis of the floquet ",
    "bloch eigenfunctions associated with the linearized nls flow .",
    "these , however , are _ not _ the eigenfunctions of the self - adjoint operator associated with the second variation itself , which would be more natural to use in the present context .",
    "in addition , many explicit computations are not transparent because they rely on nontrivial properties of the jacobi elliptic functions and integrals that are used to represent the profile @xmath32 of the periodic wave .",
    "this is why we feel that it is worth revisiting the problem using more standard pde techniques , which is the goal of the present work .",
    "the idea of using higher - order conserved quantities to solve delicate analytical problems related to orbital stability of nonlinear waves in integrable evolution equations has become increasingly popular in recent years .",
    "orbital stability of @xmath39-solitons in the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) and the cubic focusing nls equations was established in the space @xmath40 by combining the first @xmath41 conserved quantities of these equations in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for the modified kdv equation ,",

    "as already mentioned , we consider in this paper periodic waves of the cubic defocusing nls equation ( [ nls ] ) which correspond to _ real - valued _ solutions of the second - order equation ( [ wave ] ) . in that case , the second - order equation ( [ wave ] ) can be integrated once to obtain the first - order equation @xmath43 , \\quad x \\in { \\mathbb{r}},\\ ] ] where the integration constant @xmath44 $ ] can be used to parameterize all bounded solutions , up to translations . if @xmath45 , we obtain a periodic solution which has the explicit form @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the jacobi elliptic function with argument @xmath48 and parameter @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this solution corresponds to a closed orbit in the phase plane for @xmath50 , which is represented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "when @xmath51 the orbit shrinks to the center point @xmath52 , while in the limit @xmath53 the solution @xmath32 approaches the black soliton @xmath54 which corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit connecting the two saddle points @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath57 , the period of @xmath32 ( which is exactly twice the period @xmath20 of the modulus @xmath38 ) is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",

    "in addition , one can verify by explicit ( but rather cumbersome ) calculations that @xmath32 is also a critical point of the higher - order functional @xmath65 where @xmath35 is given by ( [ energy - r ] ) and @xmath25 by ( [ charge ] ) .",
    "using an idea borrowed from @xcite , we combine @xmath31 and @xmath66 by introducing the functional @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a parameter that will be fixed below .",
    "our first result is the following proposition , which establishes an _ unconstrained _ variational characterization for the periodic waves of the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) , at least when their amplitude is small enough .",
