    "many spatio - temporal dynamical systems show rare intense events .",
    "one example is that of large height rogue ocean waves @xcite .",
    "another example occurs in recent experiments on parametrically forced surface waves on water in which high spikes ( bursts ) on the free surface form intermittently in space and time @xcite",
    ". other diverse physical examples also exist ( _ e.g. , tornados , large earthquakes , etc . ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of rare intense events is an enhanced tail in the event size probability distribution function . here , by enhanced we mean that the event size probability distribution function approached zero with increasing event size much more slowly than is the case for a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus these events , although rare , can be much more common than an expectation based on gaussian statistics would indicate .",
    "the central limit theorem implies gaussian behavior for a quantity that results from the linear superposition of many random independent contributions .",
    "non - gaussian tail behavior can result from strong nonlinearity of the events , and enhancement of the event size tail might be expected if large amplitudes are nonlinearly self - reinforcing .",
    "such nonlinear self - reinforcements is present in the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . in particular , the two dimensional nls equation ,",
    "@xmath2 exhibits  collapse \" when the coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same sign @xcite . in a collapsing nls solution",
    "the complex field approaches infinity at some point in space , and this singularity occurs at finite time .",
    "the nls is conservative in that it can be derived from a hamiltonian , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 =   \\frac{1}{2 } \\int [ \\alpha |a|^4 + \\beta |\\bigtriangledown a|^2 ] d { \\bf x } $ ] . in the case of nonconservative dynamics ,",
    "inclusion of lowest order dissipation and instability terms leads to the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation @xcite .",
    "the cgl equation has been studied as a model for such diverse situation as chemical reaction @xcite , poiseuille flow @xcite , rayleigh - brnard convection @xcite , and taylor - couette flow @xcite . in the limit of zero dissipation /",
    "instability the cgl equation approaches the nls equation . for small nonzero dissipation / instability , the cgl equation displays a solution similar to the nls collapse solution , but with a large finite ( rather than infinite ) amplitude at the collapse time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , over a sufficiently large spatial domain , these events occur intermittently in space and time .",
    "thus , in this parameter regime , the cgl equation may be considered as a model for the occurrence of rare intense events . _    in this paper we study the statistics and characteristics of rare intense events in a two - dimensional cgl - based model .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the amplitude of the solutions is observed to be non - gaussian in our numerical experiments .",
    "this non - gaussian pdf is explained by the nonlinear characteristics of individual bursts combined with the statistics of bursts .",
    "the model equation we investigate is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a parametric forcing term @xcite .",
    "we will consider two cases : one without parametric forcing ( @xmath9 ) in which case the plus sign is chosen in front of the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : cgl ] ) ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : cgl ] ) is then the usual cgl equation ) , and one with parametric forcing , in which case the minus sign is chosen . as previously discussed , we choose our parameters so that our model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cgl ] ) , is formally close to the nls equation ( [ eq : nls ] ) .",
    "that is , we take @xmath10 , and for our numerical solutions we will restrict attention to the case @xmath11 .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath12 for the first term , as well as the ones in @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent no loss of generality , since these can be obtained by suitable scaling of the time(@xmath15 ) , the dependent variable(@xmath16 ) , and the spatial variable(@xmath17 ) . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the amplitude statistics of our two - dimensional cgl models with and without the parametric forcing term .",
    "we find that the pdfs are approximately described by a stretched exponential distribution , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is less than 1 . in section iii ,",
    "we investigate the characteristics of individual bursts .",
    "we compare our numerical cgl results with known collapse solutions of the nls equation .",
    "the maximum amplitude obtained by many bursts ( or the  event size \" statistics ) is discussed in section iv .",
    "section v presents further discussion and conclusions .",
    "our results lead us to the following picture for the occurrence of rare intense events in our system .",
    "linear instability and nonlinear wave saturation lead to an incoherent background of small amplitude waves .",
    "this background is responsible for the observed _ small @xmath20 gaussian behavior of our probability distribution functions .",
    "when , by chance , the weakly interacting waves locally superpose to create conditions enabling nonlinear , coherent self - reinforce , a localized , collapse - like event is initiated .",
    "collapse takes over , promoting large , rapid growth and spiking of @xmath16 .",
    "this is followed by a burn - out phase in which the energy in rapidly dissipated due to the generation of small scale structure by the spike .",
    "we believe that elements of the above general picture may be relevant to a variety of physical situations where rare intense events occur ( _ e.g. , the parametrically driven water wave experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . _ _",
    "we first consider eq.([eq : cgl ] ) with @xmath21 and with the plus sign in the first term on the right hand side of the equation .",

    "iii ) , although the occurrence of these intense events is apparently erratic in time and space , individually these events are highly coherent . in this section",
    ", we will study the statistical properties of @xmath23 .",
    "_    our numerical solutions of ( [ eq : cgl ] ) employ periodic boundary conditions on a @xmath24 grid .",
    "we choose the parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , large enough ( @xmath25 ) so that the solutions of our model are close to solutions of the nls equation .",
    "we choose the time step small enough to satisfy the condition for unconditional stability of our second - order accurate time integration(@xmath26 ) .",
    "we use random initial condition ( at @xmath27 , we generate random values for amplitudes and phases at each grid point ) .",
    "localized structures , `` bursts '' , develop very rapidly and occur throughout the spatial domain .",
    "the typical life time of a burst ( @xmath28 ) is approximately 0.2 time units .",
    "the maximum amplitudes of bursts are different for different burst events .",
    "imagining that we choose a space - time point @xmath29 at random , we now consider the probability distribution functions for @xmath20 ( the magnitude of @xmath16 ) , @xmath30 $ ] ( the real part of @xmath16 ) , and @xmath31 $ ] ( the imaginary part of @xmath16 ) .",
    "we denote these distribution functions @xmath32 , and we compute them via histogram approximations using the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 from each of the @xmath24 grid points at many time frames @xcite .",
    "we find that these distributions are independent of the periodicity length @xmath35 used in the computation as long as it is sufficiently large compared to the spatial size of a burst , but is not so large that spatial resolution on our @xmath24 grid becomes problematic . in our computations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we choose @xmath38 .    figures 2 show the numerically computed probability distributions @xmath39 [ fig .",

    "( [ eq : cgl ] ) with @xmath21 is invariant to the transformation @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is an arbitrary constant ) , we expect the distribution @xmath43 and @xmath37 to be the same to within the statistical accuracy of their determinations .",
    "this is born out by figs .",
    "2 . in order to highlight the essential role that nonlinearity plays in determining these distribution functions ,",
    "we have also computed them after randomizing the phases of each fourier component .",

    ", @xmath51 at any given point @xmath52 can be viewed as a sum of many independent random numbers ( the fourier components ) .",
    "hence the @xmath43 and @xmath37 distributions are expected to be gaussian , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "this is confirmed by the semi - log plots of figs .",
    "2 , where the data plotted as pluses can be well - fit by parabolae .",
    "the above comparisons with the phase randomized variable @xmath51 are motivated by imagining the hypothetical situation where the amplitude is formed by the superposition of many noninteracting linear plane waves . in that case",
    "we would have an amplitude field of form @xmath54 because @xmath55 is different for different @xmath48 , the phases become uncorrelated for sufficiently large time @xmath15 .    comparing the data from @xmath16 and @xmath51 in figs .",
    "2 , for small values of @xmath56 and @xmath34 , the pdfs are nearly gaussian .",
    "this can be attributed to near linear behavior of small amplitude waves . on the other hand , for the tails of the distributions , we note substantial enhancement relative to the gaussian distributions .",
    "these must be due to coherent phase correlations resulting from nonlinear interaction of different wavenumber components of @xmath16 .",
    "such phase coherence is implied by the observed coherent localized burst structures .",
    "figure 3 shows the numerically obtained distribution @xmath57 plotted as circles and the probability distribution for the phase randomized amplitude @xmath58 plotted as pluses .",
    "again , the enhancement of the large amplitude tail is evident .",
    "note that the vertical axis in fig .",
    "3 is logarithmic , while the horizontal axis is @xmath59 . here",
    "we choose the power @xmath60 so that the large @xmath20 data in this plot are most nearly fit by a straight line .",
    "that is , we attempt to fit @xmath57 using a stretched exponential .",
    "the slope of the dashed straight line in the figure is chosen to match the large @xmath20 data .",
    "thus , over the range of @xmath20 accessible to over numerical experiment , we find that the enhanced large @xmath20 tail probability density is roughly fit by a stretched exponential ,",
    "@xmath61      we now report similar results for the case of parametric forcing , eq . ( [ eq : cgl ] ) with @xmath63 and the minus sign chosen in the first term on the right side of ( [ eq : cgl ] ) . in this case ,",
    "instability of small amplitude waves is caused by the parametric forcing ( nonzero @xmath64 ) and the @xmath65 term represents a linear wavenumber independent damping .",
    "this model for parametric forcing was introduced @xcite and has been used to model various situations .",
    "one such situation is that of periodically forced chemical reactions @xcite . our motivation for considering this model is the faraday experiments on strong parametric forcing of surface water waves in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work intermittent formation of large localized surface perturbations results in splash and droplet formation .",
    "parameters for our numerical simulations are the same as in sec .",

    "the shape of the pdfs around the central part are nearly gaussian .",
    "in contrast , at large amplitude the pdfs are significantly non - gaussian . a major difference with the case",
    "@xmath21 is that , with parametric forcing , the model is not invariant to @xmath67 , and thus @xmath43 and @xmath37 may be expected to evidence differences not present for @xmath21 .",
    "this is seen to be the case in figs .",
    "[ fig : pdf_22 ] .",
    "solutions of the cgl equation with large @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be expected to have features in common with solutions of the nls equation .",
    "it is known that the nls equation yields localized events which develop finite time singularities where the amplitude becomes infinite  @xcite . while it is difficult to understand the dynamics of the solutions of cgl equation from direct rigorous analysis ,",
    "the solutions of the nls equation are relatively well understood .",
    "thus , we analyze the dynamics of individual cgl bursts guided by the known localized self - similar collapsing solution of the nls equation .",
    "the nls equation has a special solution @xcite of the form @xmath68 where the radial function @xmath69 satisfies @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",

    "note that , when they reach their maxima , the three bursts have different amplitudes and width .",
    "we rescale the amplitude and spatial coordinate as suggested by ( [ eq : rescalea ] ) and ( [ eq : rescalex ] ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and we take @xmath84 ( which normalizes @xmath85 to one ) .",

    "the three burst profiles show evidence of collapsing onto the theoretical radial solution .",

    "the self similar properties of bursts implies that the solutions of the cgl model consist of self - similar bursts of various maximum heights .",
    "thus , we expect that the enhanced tail ( the deviation from the gaussian distribution ) of the amplitude probability distribution @xmath57 can be understood by the statistics of bursts .",
    "in particular , we consider @xmath91 , the frequency of bursts which have maximum height @xmath92 , and a distribution @xmath93 defined for an individual burst ( burst @xmath94 ) , as follows .",
