    "one of the predictions of current proposals for the physical significance of derived categories ( see @xcite for an incomplete list of early references ) is that massless boundary ramond sector states of open strings connecting d - branes wrapped on complex submanifolds of calabi - yau s , with holomorphic gauge bundles , should be counted by mathematical objects known as ext groups . specifically , if we have d - branes wrapped on the complex submanifolds @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a calabi - yau @xmath3 , with holomorphic gauge fields in factors .",
    "a detailed explanation of the sheaf - brane correspondence , taking into account the freed - witten anomaly , appears in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 , respectively , then massless boundary ramond sector states should be in one - to - one correspondence with elements of either @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( depending upon the open string orientation ) .",
    "in @xcite we explicitly checked this proposal for large - radius calabi - yau s , by using standard well - known bcft methods to compute the massless ramond sector spectrum of open strings connecting such d - branes , and then relating that spectrum to ext groups .",
    "naively the massless ramond sector states are not counted by ext groups , but rather sheaf cohomology groups that are merely related to ext groups via spectral sequences .",
    "however , a closer examination of the physics revealed that , at least in cases we understand well , those spectral sequences are realized directly in brst cohomology , and so the massless ramond sector spectrum is counted directly by ext groups .",
    "in @xcite we extended the work in @xcite to consider d - branes in orbifolds .",
    "we again found that massless boundary ramond sector states are counted by ext groups , this time on quotient stacks .",
    "previously , open string spectra in orbifolds had only been computed for topologically trivial brane configurations , so we were able to implicitly solve the old technical challenge of calculating spectra for more general configurations .",
    "we also commented on the physical meaningfulness of quotient stacks .",
    "for example , fractional branes can not be described as sheaves on quotient spaces  they can only be described as sheaves on quotient stacks .    both of the papers @xcite implicitly assumed that there was no @xmath0 field background . in this paper",
    "we shall extend the methods of @xcite to the case of nonzero , nontrivial , flat @xmath0 fields .    in the presence of a nontrivial @xmath0 field",
    ", one does not have an honest bundle on d - brane worldvolumes , essentially because in open strings gauge transformations of the @xmath0 field mix with transformations of the chan - paton factors , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the identity matrix .",
    "instead , the bundle is twisted , in the sense that the transition functions @xmath10 no longer close to the identity on triple overlaps , but rather obey @xmath11 for some @xmath12-valued 2-cocycle @xmath13 partly defining the @xmath0 field .",
    "( for a readable description of nontrivial @xmath0 fields , see @xcite ) . this twisting has played an important role in , for example , the derivation @xcite of douglas s description of discrete torsion for d - branes @xcite , and",
    "has also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "one can make rigorous mathematical sense of such twisted bundles @xcite , as well as analogous twisted notions of sheaf cohomology and ext groups , as we shall review .    in this paper ,",
    "after discussing how nontrivial flat @xmath0 fields can be described by certain elements of the group @xmath14 , we shall compute the massless boundary ramond sector spectrum of open strings connecting d - branes , in the presence of a @xmath0 field defined by @xmath15 , and we shall show that such states are in one - to - one correspondence with elements of twisted ext groups , either @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( depending upon the open string orientation ) .",
    "we begin in section  [ overview ] with an overview of bundles and sheaves twisted by the @xmath0 field , and relevant bits of physics . in section  [ parcoin ] we discuss massless boundary ramond sector spectra for open strings between parallel coincident branes .",
    "the analysis proceeds very much as in @xcite , and we find that said spectra are ultimately counted by ext groups between twisted sheaves . in section  [ ex ]",
    "we discuss an example . unfortunately , due to a lack of known calabi - yau manifolds with the relevant properties , we are not able to discuss a wide variety of examples , but we do at least illustrate how the relevant calculations are performed .",
    "in section  [ pardiff ] we discuss massless boundary ramond sector spectra for parallel branes on submanifolds of different dimension . in section  [ gen ]",
    "we discuss massless boundary ramond sector spectra for general branes .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ pfs ] we prove some spectral sequences used in this paper .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the presence of a nontrivial @xmath0 field , one no longer has an honest bundle on the worldvolume of a d - brane . ordinarily on triple overlaps the transition functions @xmath18 of a bundle",
    "obey the condition @xmath19 however , @xmath0 field gauge transformations combine nontrivially with chan - paton translations , as @xmath20 so if the @xmath0 field has nonzero transition functions , then the connection on our ` bundle ' picks up affine translations between coordinate charts .",
    "the effect is that the transition functions @xmath18 of the ` bundle ' obey the condition @xcite @xmath21 for a 2-cocycle @xmath22 representing a cohomology class in @xmath23 .",
    "these cohomology classes define gerbes , and the @xmath24 satisfying ( [ cochain ] ) define twisted bundles . from the exact sequence @xmath25",
    "we get a map @xmath26 which takes @xmath27 $ ] to a class in @xmath28 , the characteristic class of the gerbe .",
    "note that @xmath29 see @xcite for more details .",
    "note that modulo scalars , ( [ cochain ] ) becomes @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 image of @xmath33 .",
    "if the twisted bundle has rank @xmath34 , then ( [ azumaya ] ) says that we get a cohomology class @xmath35\\in h^1(x , c^{\\infty}(\\mathrm{pgl}(r)))$ ] . from the exact sequence @xmath36",
    "we get a coboundary map @xmath37 , taking @xmath38 $ ] to an element of @xmath39 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the image of this class in @xmath23 induced by the inclusion @xmath40 is precisely the class of the gerbe defined by the original @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath39 is torsion , we see that rank @xmath34 twisted bundles can only exist if the class of the underlying gerbe is @xmath34 torsion",
    ". in particular , if the gerbe is not a torsion class , then there are no finite - rank twisted bundles at all .",
    "such twisted bundles are understood in mathematics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one can define not only twisted bundles , but also twisted coherent sheaves on a space .",
    "in fact , sheaves can also be defined in terms of local data and transition functions obeying a cocycle condition ( see for example ( * ? ? ? * cor .",
    "i-14 ) ) , so we can define twisted sheaves in exactly the same form as twisted bundles . on the other hand , although twisted bundles are immediately realized in d - brane physics , the physics of twisted sheaves is more obscure .",
    "part of what we are doing in this paper amounts to giving concrete evidence that d - branes in flat @xmath0 field backgrounds can be accurately modeled by twisted sheaves ( see also @xcite for previous work in this vein ) .    in this holomorphic context , the twisting is defined by an element @xmath41 associated to the @xmath0 field .",
    "moreover , one can also define ext groups between twisted sheaves .",
    "if @xmath42 , @xmath43 are two coherent sheaves on @xmath3 , both twisted by the same element @xmath44 , then one can define @xmath45 .",
    "we will say more about such ext groups and how to arrive at elements of @xmath14 from a @xmath0 field momentarily .",
    "first we will review twisted sheaves in more detail .    for convenience of the reader",
    ", we give the complete definition of a twisted sheaf .",
    "if @xmath46 is represented by a ech 2-cocycle @xmath47 on an open cover @xmath48 , with the @xmath49 holomorphic , an @xmath13-twisted sheaf @xmath50 consists of a pair @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a sheaf on @xmath53 for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 is an isomorphism for all @xmath56 , subject to the conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath57 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath58 ; 3 .   @xmath59 .",
    "the class of twisted sheaves together with the obvious notion of homomorphism is an abelian category , the category of @xmath13-twisted sheaves , leading to the stated notion of ext groups by general homological algebra .",
    "this notation is consistent , since one can prove that this category is independent of the choice of the covering @xmath60  ( @xcite ) or of the particular cocycle @xmath61  ( @xcite )    now a @xmath0-field is a connection on a gerbe .",
    "to say it is a connection means that we can express it locally as a 2-form @xmath62 , subject to gauge transformations @xmath63 for some 1-forms @xmath64 .",
    "the field strength @xmath65 is then globally defined .",
    "since @xmath66 is exact , we can locally write @xmath67 , where @xmath49 are local @xmath12-valued functions , once again representing the class of the underlying gerbe . in this context , @xmath68\\in h^3(x,\\mathbf{r})$ ] is the characteristic class of the gerbe ( it actually lies in @xmath28 ) . if in addition the @xmath0 field is flat , i.e.  if @xmath69 , then the above considerations lead to the holonomy class of @xmath0 in @xmath70 .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "in particular the contribution of the @xmath0-field to the action can be specified topologically for a closed string worldsheet .",
    "a connection on a twisted @xmath71 bundle in the presence of a @xmath0-field is analogous to the usual notion of a connection .",
    "we have a local collection of 1 forms @xmath72 satisfying @xmath73 here , @xmath64 is the gauge transformation of the @xmath0-field as discussed above , and @xmath9 is the @xmath74 identity matrix .",
    "note that @xmath75 is not gauge invariant , but @xmath76 is gauge invariant .    for completeness",
    ", we describe the relationship between elements of the group @xmath14 and gerbes , at least in the case of a calabi - yau threefold .",
    "extensions are straightforward .",
    "there is an exact sequence @xmath77 and on a calabi - yau threefold , @xmath78 .",
    "thus @xmath79 is the kernel of @xmath80 this map can be described by first mapping @xmath81 , then following with the hodge - theoretic projection of a de rham third cohomology class onto its @xmath82 component .",
    "since an element of @xmath83 is real , the @xmath84 component vanishes whenever its @xmath82 component vanishes .",
    "thus we see that given an element of @xmath85 , does not embed in @xmath86 in the presence of torsion . ]",
    "we can uniquely reconstruct a corresponding element of @xmath14 .",
    "as an aside , we should mention that the group @xmath87 plays an important role in the generalized hodge conjecture in dimension three ; see appendix  [ ghc ] for a few more details .    in this paper , we are only interested in flat fields typically break supersymmetry in calabi - yau compactifications . in non - calabi - yau compactifications where they are used , non - flat @xmath0 fields typically fix khler moduli , usually preventing one from going to weak - coupling limits where the analysis of this paper is relevant . for these reasons , we shall not consider non - flat @xmath0 fields in this paper .",
    "we should also mention , though , that the mathematical analysis of appendix  a does carry over to the case of non - flat @xmath0 fields when the d - branes are wrapped on a submanifold such that the restriction of the @xmath0 field curvature to the submanifold is torsion . ]",
    "@xmath0 fields , which means that the curvature ( the de rham image of the characteristic class ) vanishes , so the corresponding element of @xmath88 is purely torsion .",
    "when this happens , its image in @xmath89 necessarily vanishes for the above reasons .    in summary ,",
    "the torsion subgroup of @xmath90 is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of @xmath91 .",
    "so the elements of @xmath90 relevant to our study of d - branes correspond to purely topological information .",
    "as we have seen above , one can define holomorphic _ locally free _ twisted sheaves of finite rank only when the twisting is by an element of @xmath14 corresponding to a torsion element of @xmath91 .",
    "the elements arising this way form the _",
    "brauer group_. ( a widely - believed conjecture of grothendieck says that the elements of the brauer group are the same as the torsion elements of @xmath14 . ) for twistings by non - torsion elements , no locally free twisted sheaves of finite rank exist .",
    "so our physical constraint of flat @xmath0 fields translates directly into mathematics .    in passing",
    ", we will note that there is a closely analogous phenomenon in the study of wzw models .",
    "there , one has strings propagating on a group manifold with a nontrivial @xmath0 field background , in which the curvature @xmath92 of the @xmath0 field is nonzero ( this is the point of the wess - zumino term , after all ) .",
    "d - branes can not wrap the entire group manifold . instead , d - branes can only wrap submanifolds @xmath93 such that the restriction of the characteristic class to @xmath93 is torsion @xcite , mirroring the statement that finite - rank locally - free twisted sheaves only exist when the characteristic class of the twisting is torsion .    another way to think about twisted holomorphic bundles is that they are associated to projective space bundles that can not be obtained by projectivizing an ordinary holomorphic vector bundle . in detail , given a projective space bundle , imagine lifting the fibers locally from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "the original projective space bundle was a _ bundle _",
    ", so its transition functions close on triple overlaps .",
    "however , if we lift those same transition functions from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , then they need only close up to the action of @xmath96 on triple overlaps .",
    "in other words , given a projective space bundle , it need not lift to an honest vector bundle , but in general will only lift to a twisted vector bundle , twisted by an element of @xmath97 defined by the failure of the transition functions to close on triple overlaps .    given two twisted sheaves @xmath98 , @xmath99 , one can define a twisted sheaf of local homomorphisms @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath98 is twisted by @xmath44 and @xmath99 is twisted by @xmath101 , then @xmath102 is a twisted sheaf , twisted by @xmath103 .    in particular , if two bundles @xmath98 , @xmath99 are twisted by the _",
    "same _ element of @xmath14 , then @xmath102 is an ordinary , untwisted sheaf .",
    "we can use that fact to set up homological algebra in the usual form . if @xmath42 , @xmath43 are two twisted sheaves , but twisted by the _",
    "same _ element of @xmath14 , then we can define local @xmath104 and global @xmath105 .",
    "this last fact is directly relevant for this paper , as in any given theory there is only a single @xmath0 field that twists the d - brane bundles .",
    "thus , open string spectra are always computed between twisted sheaves that have been twisted by the same element of @xmath14 , which means that for all our string spectrum calculations , there exists a relevant notion of ext groups in mathematics , and the associated ext sheaves are ordinary sheaves .",
    "serre duality functions for twisted sheaves much as for ordinary untwisted sheaves . for @xmath44",
    "an element of the brauer group ( _ i.e. _ corresponding to a flat @xmath0 field ) , for any two @xmath106-twisted coherent sheaves @xmath42 , @xmath43 on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath3 , we have @xmath107    we have spoken a great deal so far about twisted sheaves in general terms .",
    "although our remarks apply in principle , in practice we unfortunately do not know of any examples of smooth calabi - yau manifolds with non - zero torsion part of @xmath14 .",
    "we do know of some spaces that are close but not quite calabi - yau , and for the purposes of illustrating our methods with some concrete examples , we will mention a few such examples .",
    "our example of a space with nonzero torsion in @xmath14 is taken directly from the appendix of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath108 be a generic hypersurface of bidegree ( 2,2 ) , and let @xmath109 be the discriminant locus of the fibration @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the projection onto the first factor .",
    "one can show that @xmath112 is an octic surface with 80 ordinary nodes .",
    "let @xmath113 be the double cover of @xmath114 branched over @xmath112 , and let @xmath115 be the blowup of the 80 nodes of @xmath3 , so that @xmath116 is smooth .",
    "since we have blown - up the nodes , rather than small - resolved them , this space is not quite calabi - yau , but in some sense , close .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this space has 2-torsion in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth complex submanifold of a calabi - yau @xmath3 , and let @xmath44 define a flat @xmath0 field .",
    "let @xmath98 , @xmath99 be two @xmath118-twisted holomorphic bundles on @xmath93 , corresponding to the twisted bundles on the worldvolumes of two sets of branes , both wrapped on @xmath93 .",
    "since we are assuming the @xmath0 field is flat , locally we can gauge the @xmath0 field to zero , so the physics analysis proceeds exactly as in @xcite , except that the chan - paton factors now couple to twisted bundles rather than honest bundles @xcite .- field is not flat , namely if we only assume that the @xmath0 field becomes flat after restriction to @xmath93 .",
    "so our subsequent physical analysis can proceed somewhat more generally than we consider in this paper .",
    "mathematically , we can replace the hypothesis that the twisting class @xmath41 is torsion with the weaker hypothesis that its restriction @xmath119 is torsion .",
    "in this situation @xmath120-twisted bundles on @xmath93 exist .",
    "the mathematical proofs in appendix  [ pfs ] can be extended to apply in this more general situation .",
    "] we shall omit the detailed explanation ( consult @xcite for details ) .",
    "the boundary ramond sector states are of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 as brst invariants in the standard notation for the @xmath0 model @xcite , subject to the boundary conditions @xmath123 for dirichlet directions , and _ naively _",
    "@xmath124 for neumann directions .",
    "( the boundary conditions are modified by the chan - paton factors , as in @xcite , a point we shall return to momentarily . )",
    "the indices @xmath13 , @xmath125 are chan - paton indices , describing the @xmath118-twisted holomorphic bundles @xmath98 , @xmath99 on @xmath93 .",
    "naively , physical states of the form above should be in one - to - one correspondence with elements of the sheaf cohomology groups @xmath126 .",
    "note that although @xmath98 and @xmath99 are both twisted bundles , instead of honest bundles , we can still speak of ordinary bundle - valued sheaf cohomology , since the product @xmath127 is untwisted .    as in @xcite",
    ", there is a spectral sequence @xmath128 relating the sheaf cohomology above to the desired ( @xmath106-twisted ) ext groups .",
    "( see appendix  [ pfs ] for proofs . )",
    "how is this spectral sequence realized physically ? as in @xcite , there are two important subtleties that must be taken into account :    1 .",
    "@xmath129 need not split holomorphically , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath130 in general , so it is not quite right to interpret the vertex operators as @xmath131-valued forms . 2 .",
    "the boundary conditions are twisted , by the curvature of the chan - paton factors and the @xmath0 field ( see @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 3.3 ) ) ) , so that for neumann directions , @xmath132 , but rather @xmath133 .",
    "just as in @xcite , in the special case that @xmath134 , we shall see explicitly that taking care of these two subtleties has the effect of physically realizing the spectral sequence in brst cohomology .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that the same result is true in general : being careful about these subtleties should have the effect of realizing all spectral sequences we discuss in this paper directly in brst cohomology , so that the physical massless boundary ramond sector states are in one - to - one correspondence with elements of ext groups .",
    "let us specialize to the case @xmath134 , to see how the spectral sequence is realized explicitly .",
    "as the argument is essentially identical to that in @xcite , we shall be brief .",
    "we deal with both of the subtleties above in the same form as in @xcite .",
    "the first subtlety is dealt with by lifting @xmath131-valued forms to @xmath129-valued forms , which can be directly associated to vertex operators , unlike @xmath131-valued forms .",
    "the resulting @xmath129-valued forms need not be holomorphic , however",
    ". their images under @xmath135 are @xmath136-valued forms , to which we can apply the boundary condition @xmath137 .",
    "thus , the brst operator acting on the @xmath129-valued forms can be interpreted as a composition of @xmath135 and an evaluation map .",
    "for example , starting from an element of @xmath138 , we have the composition @xmath139 where the first map ( @xmath140 ) is the coboundary map , and the second map ( @xmath141 ) is the evaluation map realizing the boundary conditions .",
    "this argument is identical to that used in @xcite , except for the fact that here @xmath98 is an @xmath118-twisted holomorphic bundle , not an honest holomorphic bundle . also just as in @xcite ,",
    "the composition above is exactly the differential @xmath142 of the spectral sequence .    finally , as in @xcite",
    ", we still have an atiyah class @xmath143 corresponding to the canonical extension @xmath144 of twisted sheaves defined by the twisted sheaf of 1-jets of @xmath98 .",
    "the second map is simply cup product with @xmath145 .",
    "note that @xmath146 is an ordinary sheaf .",
    "the computation proceeds exactly as in @xcite .",
    "the only change is that the boundary conditions get modified as we have discussed above , corresponding to ( [ atiyah ] ) being an extension of twisted sheaves rather than of ordinary sheaves .",
    "thus , we have seen explicitly that in the special case @xmath134 , the spectral sequence is realized directly in brst cohomology .",
    "we conjecture that the same statement is true for more general @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "in this section we shall briefly consider an example involving branes wrapped on a submanifold of a space with nontrivial torsion in @xmath14 .    now ,",
    "as mentioned earlier , we do not have any examples of calabi - yau s with such a property .",
    "however , we do have some examples of spaces that are not quite calabi - yau , and for the purposes of illustrating how to perform computations using the technology presented here , such an example will do .",
    "of course , since the space @xmath3 is not calabi - yau , our computations will be purely formal in nature  they can not reflect any physics , since the b model can not be defined on @xmath3 .",
    "recall earlier we mentioned an example taken from the appendix of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath108 be a generic hypersurface of bidegree ( 2,2 ) , and let @xmath109 be the discriminant locus of the fibration @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the projection onto the first factor .",
    "one can show that @xmath112 is an octic surface with 80 ordinary nodes .",
    "let @xmath113 be the double cover of @xmath114 branched over @xmath112 , and let @xmath115 be the blowup of the 80 nodes of @xmath3 , so that @xmath116 is smooth .",
    "the discussion in @xcite identifies a 2-torsion element @xmath147 by exhibiting a @xmath148 bundle over @xmath3 minus its nodes , and showing that this is not the projectivization of a vector bundle @xmath149 . after blowing up the nodes ,",
    "this argument can be transferred to @xmath116 .    in other words ,",
    "the @xmath148 bundle of @xcite is the projectivization of an @xmath13-twisted bundle @xmath149 on @xmath116 .",
    "let us imagine ( formally ) working with the b model on @xmath116 , and wrapping d - branes on all of @xmath116 with twisted bundle @xmath149 .",
    "since we are wrapping all of @xmath116 , the spectral sequence is unnecessary . in any case , the spectral sequence degenerates and @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath151 is an ordinary bundle ( the associated azumaya algebra of brauer group theory ) . in passing , note",
    "that it is only because the @xmath0 field is nontrivial that we could consider such twisted bundles on the brane worldvolume  were the @xmath0 field to be zero , for example , no such branes would exist .",
    "now let @xmath152 be the exceptional divisor of the blowup of one of the 80 nodes .",
    "each @xmath153 .",
    "in particular , there is no torsion in @xmath154 or @xmath155 and so the @xmath0 field can be trivialized after restricting to @xmath152 .",
    "thus the gauge fields on @xmath156-branes wrapping @xmath152 live in ordinary bundles .",
    "if @xmath157 and @xmath158 are distinct , they are disjoint and so @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the natural inclusions .",
    "furthermore , the spectral sequence for @xmath162 is identical to the corresponding spectral sequence in the absence of a @xmath0-field , so the presence of the @xmath0-field does not affect the spectrum .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details of the analysis in the untwisted case , and the analysis in the twisted case is a nearly exact duplicate .",
