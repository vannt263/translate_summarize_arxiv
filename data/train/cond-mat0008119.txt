    "anderson localization has attracted renewed interest since a plenty of new universality classes were discoverd @xcite .",
    "one is a system with particle - hole symmetry studied by gade @xcite .",
    "although generic disorderd systems in two dimensions are believed to be insulators @xcite , she showed that such a system has a random critical point at the band center .",
    "typical examples studied so far are the random flux model @xcite and the random - hopping model with @xmath0-flux @xcite .",
    "this class is often referred to as @xmath5iii and @xmath6i in the case with broken and unbroken time reversal symmetry , respactively , which corresponds to the chiral gaussian unitary and chiral gaussian orthogonal ensamble of the random matirx theory in the zero dimensional limit @xcite .",
    "other examples of new universality classes are found in disordered @xmath7-wave superconductors described by a mean - field bogoliubov - degennes hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "altland and zirnbauer @xcite classified them by two basic symmetries , i.e , spin - ratation and time - reversal into four kinds of classes . with ( without )",
    "spin - rotation invariance , disordered @xmath7-wave superconductors belong to class @xmath8 and @xmath8i ( @xmath9 and @xmath9iii ) , respectively , in the case with broken and unbroken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the beta function of the renormalization group for corresponding nonlinear sigma models in two dimensions tells that the classes @xmath8 and @xmath8i have localized states only , whereas the classes @xmath9 and @xmath9iii may have delocalized states .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that some of them allow in the nonlinear sigma model description the topological term @xcite which plays a crucial role , for example , in quantum hall transitions @xcite , or the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite which gives rise to a nontrivial strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "therefore , disordered @xmath7-wave superconductors are expected to have quite rich phase diagram .",
    "these developments can shed new light on the localization problems .",
    "for example , the question whether the density of states of the random flux model diverges had been a long - standing problem .",
    "recognizing , however , that it belongs to the gade s class of @xmath5iii type , furusaki concluded that the dos actually diverges .",
    "another example is the disordered fermion model with @xmath0-flux we will revisit in this paper .",
    "this model was already studied by fisher and fradkin @xcite in 1984 .",
    "they showed that the effective field theory of the lattice model with random on - site potentials belongs to the universality class of o(@xmath10)/o(@xmath11o(@xmath3 ) nonlinear sigma model , concluding thereby that all states are localizaed .",
    "a point here is that the continuum limit of the model includes random potentials specified by four independent coupling constants .",
    "since fisher and fradkin studied only the case where all the coupling constants are equal , we can expect richer phase diagram in the whole space of the coupling constants .",
    "actually , although the generic points in this space should flow into the localized phase mentioned - above , the model has enhanced symmetry in special cases and accordingly renormalization group flows in them are toward different fixed points . another point in this paper",
    "is concerned with chiral symmetry .",
    "it was shown that generic disordered @xmath7-wave superconductors in class @xmath8i , described by dirac fermions , yield no wzw term @xcite although those dirac fermions have chiral sp(@xmath1sp(@xmath2 ) symmetry .",
    "the reason may be that chirality is not unique in the @xmath7-wave dirac fermions , since the lattice fermion gives the species doubling in the continuum limit . here",
    ", chiral symmetry means that there exist a matrix which anticommutes with a hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in detail the phase diagram of the disordered fermion model with @xmath0-flux by means of the fermionic replica method to clarify these points .",
    "we show that this model , described by double dirac fermions , has three kinds of chiral symmetry in special cases .",
    "interestingly , these different chiral symmetries lead to different universality classes",
    ". to be concrete , an effective action of the green functions has sp(@xmath1sp(@xmath2 ) symmetry in one of them and u@xmath12 symmetry in the others , both of which are broken down to sp(@xmath2 ) .",
    "it turns out that corresponding goldstone mode can be described by sp(@xmath4 wzw model and u(@xmath2)/sp(@xmath2 ) nonlinear sigma model , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a lattice model , which is the same as fisher and fradkin studied , and derive dirac hamiltonian in the continuum limit .",
    "although the most generic model has only time - reversal invariance , symmetry is enhanced on three surfaces in the space of the coupling constants .",
    "we focus our attention to one of them with sp(@xmath1sp(@xmath2 ) symmetry ( others have u(@xmath3 ) symmetry ) and give calcualtions in detail . based on the continuum hamiltonian",
    ", we derive an effective generating functional of ensemble - averaged green functions in sec . [",

    "s : sum ] , we give a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "we define a baisc lattice model on the square lattice in two dimensions . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce similar notations used by ludwig et al @xcite in the following way .",
    "the square lattice in two dimensions is divided into unit cells , each composed of a plaqutte enclosing four sites .",
    "a plaquette is labled by a set of integers @xmath13 and four sites on it are numbered 1,2,3 and 4 counterclockwise , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] .",
    "with such a notational convention , a pure and disorder hamiltonian denoted respectively as @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is random real number due to nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "negative signs of the third and the sixth terms in @xmath14 are due to @xmath0 flux imposed .",
    "now let us construct an effective hamiltonian near the band center in the case of weak disorder . to this end",
    ", we first derive the continuum limit of the pure model , and next we take into account the effects of disorder .",
    "fourier transformation @xmath20 for @xmath21 leads to @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",

    "the total hamiltonian we investigate in this paper is @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "( [ conpurham ] ) and ( [ condisham ] ) with ( [ gamalp ] ) .",
    "it is noted that this is the same model as fisher and fradkin @xcite studied in the case @xmath54 .",

    "according to zirnbauer , this class is referred to as @xmath5ii @xcite .",
    "although a slight relaxation of the condition @xmath54 still leads to the same universality class , several subspaces in @xmath56 have not only time - reversal symmetry but also additional enhanced symmetry specified below , and therefore belong to different universality classes .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine symmetries of the present model , which plays a crucial role in the classification of the universality classes for disordered systems .",
    "first of all , the most general hamiltonian has unbroken time - reversal symmetry . in the original basis , it is expressed by @xmath57 , whereas in the rotated basis where the hamiltonian is described by the matrices in eq .",
    "( [ gamalp ] ) , it is expressed by @xmath58 if the model does not have any other symmetries , the universality class is @xmath5ii and hence all states are localized .",
    "there are several subspaces in @xmath56 , however , on which symmetry is enhanced .",
    "to be concrete , the hamiltonian ( [ conpurham ] ) has following symmetry @xmath59    recently , hatsugai et.al @xcite proposed the same model as eq .",
    "( [ latham ] ) but with random hoppings instead of random on - site potential , which we will refer to as hwkm model .",
    "they have shown that such hamiltonian has not only time - reversal symmetry but also another one often called chiral symmetry .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this symmetry is responsible for the existence of delocalized critical point at the zero energy .",
    "chiral symmetry in this case is expressed as @xmath60 with @xmath61 , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ chisym ] ) , and the universality class is specified as @xmath6i or in other words u@xmath62sp(@xmath2 ) ( gl(2@xmath2,r)/o(2@xmath2 ) ) nonlinear sigma model for fermionic ( bosonic ) replica method . considering these",
    ", it is easily guessed that the symmetry ( [ chisym ] ) also plays a crucial role in anderson localization for the present model . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ chisym ] ) also as chiral symmetry .",
    "it is so tedious to repeat similar calculations that we concentrate on the case @xmath63 , and hence we often denote @xmath63 just as @xmath64 for short . but with slight modification , any @xmath65 can apply to the formulation . at the moment",
    ", the difference between @xmath63 and the others is whether @xmath65 commutes or anticommutes with @xmath66 and whether it is real symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "surprisingly , this difference , which seems trivial at first glance , leads to a different universality class .    in order to study the trasport properties of the model near the zero energy",
    ", we need to compute the green functions @xmath67 with the @xmath64 symmetry , however , we do not need to distinguish the retarded and advanced green functions , since they are related with each other via the relation @xcite , @xmath68 the green function @xmath69 can be computed by a replicated functional @xmath70 with @xmath71 where the subscript @xmath72 denotes the @xmath2 species in the replica space @xmath52 , @xmath73 , and the usual convention of the matrix product is applied to the fermion matrix field @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "although such a notational convention is not always necessary , it is quite convenient for us to save many complicated subscripts .",
    "it should be noted that the fields @xmath76 and @xmath77 are completely independent grassmann variables .",
    "therefore , they obey in general different transformation laws .      based on the lagrangian ( [ lagbefave ] ) , we will construct an effective theory of order parameter fields for the replicas by averaging - over disorder . in this process",
    ", it is quite important to fully incorporate the symmetries ( [ timrev ] ) and ( [ chisym ] ) in the space @xmath51 . to this end",
    ", we introduce an auxiliary space to reflect these into the replicas , according to the method developed by zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "namely , we extend the replica space as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 @xmath80 stands for the space associtaed with time - reversal ( chiral ) symmetry . we then introduce a @xmath81 matrix field @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 , and @xmath86 stands for the transpose of @xmath49 . since the components of these fields are not independent of each other , the fields are subject to the constraints @xmath87 note that the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath0 are defined in @xmath88 , whereas @xmath66 and @xmath64 are defined in @xmath51 .",
    "we immediately find @xmath89 these relations tell that the matrix @xmath90 in @xmath51 has the same symmetries as @xmath91 has .",
    "it is also easy to find alternative relations for the matrix @xmath92 in @xmath88 , @xmath93 these relations actually specify the symmetry of the model , as we shall see lator .    although the potentials @xmath94 and @xmath95 have time - reversal and chiral symmetries , the converse is not true : the symmetries ( [ timrev ] ) and ( [ chisym ] ) admit other potentials @xmath96 and @xmath97 . the reason why there are no beta matrices in eq .",
    "( [ condisham ] ) is that the basic lattice model ( [ latham ] ) includes only on - site random potential .",
    "namely , if we take all kinds of possible disorder for the lattice hamiltonian including random ( nearest neighbor and diagonal ) hoppings as well as random on - site potentials , we have a continuum hamiltonian with all kinds of possible disorder potentials specified by the relations ( [ timrev ] ) and ( [ chisym ] ) .",
    "such a model may be referred to as a model with maximum entropy .",
    "since we are interested in the model with on - site random potentials , we have to remove these @xmath98 matrices . for this purpose , we take account of additional conditions @xmath99 it is readily seen that the potentials including beta matrices do not satisfy these relations .",
    "let us then introduce the fields @xmath100 we refer to this extra space as @xmath101 .",

    "it should be noted that integration over @xmath103 is readily performed , since the matrix @xmath102 has completely the same symmetries as @xmath103 has .",
    "this is the reason why we have introduced several auxiliary spaces in the last subsection . by using @xmath114 again and the definition of ( [ cirpsi ] ) , the gaussian integration over @xmath103 leads to @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",

    "adding the symmetry - breaking term in ( [ actchitra ] ) , we end up with an action @xmath257 therefore , it turns out that the goldstone mode of the model with chiral symmetry of type @xmath63 can be described by sp(@xmath4 wzw model ( [ wzwact ] ) with a symmetry breaking term as in ( [ finact ] ) .",
    "so far we have considered the case where hamiltonian has the chiral symmetry specified by @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ chisym ] ) . as to the other cases , similar calculations lead to u(@xmath3)/sp(@xmath2 ) nonlinear sigma model , which is so - called chiral orthogonal class or @xmath6i , the same universality class as hwkm model .",
    "we present a schematic phase diagram at the zero energy in fig . [",
    "f : fig2 ] , which is valid for weak disorder , i.e , for small @xmath258 .    in the case",
    "@xmath259 , which is denoted by a white surface in the figure , the model belongs to class @xmath8i and is described by sp(@xmath4 wzw model with some irrelevant perturbations discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : effpot ] and [ s : anieff ] .",
    "the reason why the present wzw model is level-2 is that the continuum limit ( [ conpurham ] ) leads to double dirac fermions .",
    "one of the main origin of the irrelevant interactions is that the lattice model has only on - site potentials without any hopping randomness .",
    "namely , the model does not have maximum entropy .",
    "another origin is the anisotropy @xmath110 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : anieff ] . besides , the continuum model should have basically many higher order irrelevant interactions . therefore , at the zero energy any points on this surface flow to the sp(@xmath4 wzw fixed point , denoted by a black circle in the figure .",
    "it turns out that around the fixed point the density of states obeys the scaling law @xmath260 , following from the exact results obtained by knizhnik and zamolodchikov @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the universality class of the two surfaces @xmath261 and @xmath262 , shaded in the figure , is different .",
    "they belong to the class of u(@xmath3)/sp(@xmath2 ) nonlinear sigma model or in other words , chiral orthogonal class or class @xmath6i , which is the same universality class as that of hwkm model .",
    "it is well - known that the beta function of the renormalization group vanishes and the coupling constant of the nonlinear sigma model is not renormalized .",
    "hence any points on these surfaces are critical .",
    "the density of states is conjectured to be divergent at the zero energy , according to @xmath263 $ ] with a positive constant @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "these surfaces , one @xmath8i and two @xmath6i s , are unstable : out the surfaces renormalization group flows are toward the strong - coupling limit of sp(@xmath3)/sp(@xmath1sp(@xmath2 ) nonlinear sigma model , as shown by fisher and fradkin for @xmath54 case .",
    "therefore , all states away from the surfaces are expected to be localized .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of the disordered fermion model with random on - site potential defined on a two - dimensional square lattice with @xmath0-flux .",
    "the continuum limit near the zero energy yields dirac fermions with random potentials specified by four independent coupling constants .",
    "it has been argued that in addition to time - reversal symmetry , this model has so - called chiral symmetry in three subspaces in the space of the coupling constants . here",
    ", chiral symmetry means that there exist a matrix anticommuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "what is interesting is that this model alows three kinds of chiral symmetry , which is due to the species doubling of the lattice fermion .",
    "it has been shown that one of them leads to sp(@xmath1sp(@xmath2 ) symmety of the lagrangian for generating functional of emsemble - averaged green functions whereas the others lead to u(@xmath3 ) symmetry , both of which is broken to sp(@xmath2 ) .",
    "it has been found that the fluctuation around the saddle point is described , respectively , by sp(@xmath4 wzw model for the former and u(@xmath3)/sp(@xmath2 ) nonlinear sigma model for the latter .",
    "based on these results , we have proposed a phase diagram .",
    "the dirac fermion model with @xmath63 symmetry calculated in detail in the text is quite similar to that for the disordered @xmath7-wave superconductors with spin - ratation and time - reversal symmetries .",
    "actually , effective lagrangians for these systems have sp(@xmath1sp(@xmath2 ) symmetry and hence both the models belong to the same universality class @xmath8i . however , fixed - points are quite different due to the wzw term",
    ". it was shown @xcite that in the @xmath7-wave superconductors the wzw terms for several species of dirac fermions cancel each other and the resultant theory predicts localization of quasiparticles at the band center . contrary to this , the model treated in this paper is described by level-2 wzw model , which means that it has delocalized states .",
    "the difference lies in eq .",
    "( [ sigg ] ) : in the present model the wzw term survives owing to the relation @xmath264/2i=\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu}{{\\cal p}}_1 $ ] , which is due to @xmath265 .",
    "this is just the same definition of so - called @xmath266 in the particle physics literature , although the present @xmath34 matrices are not @xmath267 but @xmath157 .",
    "conversely , we can say that chiral symmetry only in this sense yields the chiral anomaly and hence the wzw term , although we often use the same words for other similar symmetry in the anderson localization literature . considering the fact that the lattice model having @xmath63 chiral symmetry is realized in the case @xmath268 and @xmath269 in eq .",
    "( [ latham ] ) , which is indeed a fine - tuned model , we conclude that the delocalization due to the existence of the wzw term seldom occures in nature .",
