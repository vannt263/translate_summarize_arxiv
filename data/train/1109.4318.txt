    "in the past few decades , there have been several discoveries in the field of quantum information science which utilize quantum mechanical principles to enhance our abilities to compute and communicate @xcite .",
    "an important connecting string in this area is the notion of `` quantum correlation '' that may exist in the multiparticle quantum states .",
    "in particular , entanglement of shared quantum states @xcite is the vital element for the success of quantum communication protocols @xcite , including the quantum dense coding protocol @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement - based quantum cryptography @xcite , and remote state preparation @xcite .",
    "shared entanglement is also an essential ingredient of measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the theoretical success of quantum information protocols has been closely followed by experimental implementations , and in particular , entangled multisite quantum states are being realized in a large number of laboratories .",
    "while most multiparty quantum information phenomena occur with the active support of shared entanglement , there are important examples where a multisite nonclassical phenomena is predicted without using entangled quantum states .",
    "one example is the phenomenon of `` quantum nonlocality without entanglement '' , where a set of unentangled multiparty quantum states exhibit the nonclassical feature of local indistinguishability of orthogonal states @xcite ( cf .",
    "another example is deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit , where it is possible to perform simulations that have no known efficient classical algorithms , although the control qubit and the mixed qubits do not possess any entanglement between themselves @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to search for quantum correlation concepts that are independent of the entanglement - separability paradigm .",
    "such attempts have been made , a prominent one being quantum discord , defined from information - theoretic concepts @xcite .",
    "there have been several other developments in this direction including quantifying multiparticle quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations defined within the entanglement - separability paradigm and from an information - theoretic perspective are apparently very different in nature , and exhibit quite a variety of different mutually exclusive properties .",
    "it is therefore interesting to find common features shared by all or a class of quantum correlation measures . in this direction",
    ", it may be envisaged that quantum correlations , in contrast to classical ones , satisfy a monogamy relation .",
    "such a relation is indeed satisfied by certain measures of entanglement , so that if two parties are highly entangled , then they can not have a large amount of entanglement shared with a third one @xcite .",
    "however , monogamy may not be satisfied by information - theoretic measures of quantum correlations @xcite ( cf .",
    "more precisely , the monogamy relation for a bipartite quantum correlation measure @xmath0 , as applied to a quantum state @xmath1 shared between three observers @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , states that @xmath5 where @xmath6 and similarly for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the measure @xmath0 of the state @xmath1 considered in the @xmath9 bipartite split .",
    "we introduce here the concept of `` quantum monogamy score '' , corresponding to a quantum correlation measure @xmath0 , given by @xmath10 so that the tripartite quantum state @xmath1 satisfies the monogamy relation for @xmath0 if the quantum monogamy score , corresponding to @xmath0 , is positive , and violates the same if @xmath11 is negative .",
    "note here that the definition of the monogamy relation and quantum monogamy score gives a special status to one of the three observers ( observer @xmath2 , here ) .",
    "we will call such an observer as the `` node '' for the particular quantum monogamy score defined . for some quantum correlation measures ,",
    "the quantum monogamy score may be independent of which observer is considered to be the nodal observer .",
    "however , this is not true in general .    in an effort towards finding quantitative connections between the twin paradigms , entanglement - separability and information - theoretic , in which quantum correlations are defined ,",
    "koashi and winter @xcite established a relation between a _",
    "bipartite _ entanglement measure ( precisely , entanglement of formation @xcite ) and a _ bipartite _ information - theoretic quantum correlation measure ( precisely , quantum discord ) for three - qubit states .",
    "a similar connection was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite between logarithmic negativity @xcite ( a bipartite entanglement measure ) and bipartite information - theoretic quantum correlation measures , in the quantum dynamics of a spin chain .",
    "we address the same question in a _",
    "multipartite _ scenario .",
    "in particular , we obtain a relation between a multipartite information - theoretic quantum correlation ( `` discord monogamy score '' ) and a genuine multipartite entanglement measure ( generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite ) for three - qubit pure states .",
    "we reveal a cone - like structure in the space spanned by the two measures .",
    "more precisely , given a certain amount of quantum monogamy score , we find that the genuine multiparty entanglement ( as quantified by ggm ) of a three - qubit pure quantum state @xmath12 is restricted to lie above a certain ( nonzero ) positive value .",
    "interestingly , this positive value coincides with the ggm of the generalized ghz state @xcite , whose quantum monogamy score is equal to the modulus of that of @xmath12 . the quantum correlation measure in the quantum monogamy score",
    "is quantified either by the square of the concurrence @xcite or by quantum discord @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that in analogy with the space - time light cone where events can not occur outside it , multiparty quantum states can not appear outside the `` light cone '' of quantum monogamy scores and genuine multiparty entanglement .",
    "we believe that such relations will help towards building a unified framework for quantum correlation measures . that the quantum monogamy score for concurrence squared is a multiparty entanglement measure",
    "was already noted by coffman , kundu , and wootters @xcite . below we will show ( proposition i ) that the quantum monogamy score corresponding to quantum discord can be interpreted as an information - theoretic multiparty quantum correlation measure .",

    "we discuss our results in a concluding section ( sec .",
    "[ sec - ekhane - conclu ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will briefly describe the measures of quantum correlations that will be used later in this paper .",
    "the concept of concurrence @xcite originates from the definition of entanglement of formation .",
    "the entanglement of formation of a bipartite quantum state is intuitively ( modulo certain additivity problems ) the amount of singlets , @xmath13 , that are required to prepare the state by local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are orthonormal quantum states .",
    "the entanglement of formation of a pure bipartite state , @xmath16 shared between two parties @xmath2 and @xmath3 , can be shown to be equal to the von neumann entropy of the local density matrix of the shared state @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the partial traces of combined system @xmath20 over subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively , and @xmath21 is the von neumann entropy of a quantum state @xmath22 .",
    "entanglement of formation of a mixed bipartite state @xmath23 is then defined by the convex roof approach : @xmath24 where the minimization is over all pure state decompositions of @xmath25 .",
    "this minimization is usually hard to perform .",
    "however , there exists a closed form in the case of two - qubit states @xcite , in terms of the concurrence . the concurrence @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath29 in decreasing order . here",
    "@xmath30 is given by @xmath31 , where the complex conjugation is performed in the computational basis and @xmath32 is the pauli spin matrix .      classically , there are two equivalent ways to arrive at the concept of mutual information between two random variables .",
    "one is by adding the shannon entropies of the individual random variables , and then subtracting that of the joint probability distribution .",
    "therefore , the mutual information @xmath33 between two random variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be defined as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the shannon entropy of the random variable @xmath34 that is distributed according to the probability distribution @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the shannon entropy of the joint probability distribution of the two random variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a second way is to interpret the shannon entropy of a random variable as the information deficit ( disorder ) that we possess for that random variable .",
    "then we choose any of the two random variables , say @xmath34 , and consider the information deficit , @xmath40 , corresponding to that random variable .",
    "then , the mutual information between @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be defined as the disorder remaining in the variable @xmath34 after the `` conditional disorder '' of the variable @xmath34 given that @xmath35 has already occurred , is removed .",
    "precisely , this is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the corresponding conditional entropy .",
    "of course , these two ways of defining the ( classical ) mutual information are mathematically equivalent .    in the quantum domain ,",
    "these two quantities are different , and leads to the definition of quantum discord @xcite . the classical definition of mutual information given in eq .",
    "( [ mutualinfo1 ] ) can be taken over to the quantum regime by replacing the shannon entropies by von neumann ones : for a quantum state @xmath23 of two parties , the `` quantum mutual information '' is defined as @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the local density matrices of @xmath23 .",
    "quantization of the second definition of classical mutual information ( eq . ( [ mutualinfo2 ] ) )",
    "has to be performed in a different way than replacing shannon entropies by von neumann ones , as the latter gives rise to a physical quantity that can be negative for some quantum states @xcite .",
    "however , interpreting the conditional entropy in the classical case , as a measure of the lack of information about one random variable when the other is known , in a joint probability distribution of two random variables , the second definition of classical mutual information can be quantized for a bipartite quantum state @xmath23 as @xmath46 where the `` quantum conditional entropy '' is defined as @xmath47 with the minimization being over all projection - valued measurements , @xmath48 , performed on subsystem @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath50 , and the corresponding post - measurement state for the subsystem @xmath2 is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the quantum system that is in possession of @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the two quantizations produce inequivalent quantum quantities , and is interpreted as the result of quantum correlations present in the bipartite quantum state .",
    "the difference was consequently interpreted as a measure of quantum correlations , and called as the quantum discord .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the quantum mutual information is never lower than the quantity @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the quantum discord is given by @xcite @xmath54 in contrast to many other measures of quantum correlations , even some separable states produce a nonzero discord .",
    "a multiparty pure quantum state is said to be _ genuinely _ multiparty entangled if it is entangled across every bipartition of its constituent parties .",
    "the amount of genuine multiparty entanglement present in a multiparty state can be quantified by the recently introduced genuine multipartite entanglement measure called the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite ( cf .",
    "the ggm of an @xmath55-party pure quantum state @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , with the maximization being over all pure states @xmath59 that are not genuinely @xmath55-party entangled .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the maximal schmidt coefficients in the @xmath62 bipartite split of @xmath63 .",
    "we will consider the quantum monogamy scores for two measures of quantum correlations .",
    "the first one is when the measure of quantum correlation is the concurrence squared , while the second one is when it is the quantum discord . in the case",
    "when the quantum correlation measure is the square of the concurrence , the corresponding quantum monogamy score has been called the `` 3-tangle '' or `` residual tangle '' @xcite",
    ". we will call it the `` entanglement monogamy score '' , and denote it as @xmath64 . in the second case ,",
    "when the quantum correlation measure is the quantum discord , the quantum monogamy score is related to the concept of `` dissension '' @xcite , a multiparty information - theoretic quantum correlation measure .",
    "we will explicitly show the connection between the quantum monogamy score for quantum discord with dissension - like multiparty quantum correlation measures in sec .",
    "[ holde - sobuj - orangotang ] .",
    "we will call the quantum monogamy score corresponding to quantum discord as the `` discord monogamy score '' , and denote it as @xmath65 .",
    "intuitively , the quantum monogamy score , corresponding to a chosen bipartite quantum correlation measure , of a multiparty quantum system , encapsulates a _ multiparty",
    "_ quantum correlation of the shared system .",
    "for example for a tripartite quantum state shared between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , the quantum monogamy score is the amount of quantum correlation remaining in the @xmath9 bipartite split , after the two bipartite contributions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are subtracted out .",
    "the remaining quantum correlations must therefore be multipartite in nature .",
    "it is therefore natural to look for connections of quantum monogamy score with other more directly - defined measures of multiparty quantum correlations , like the generalized geometric measure .",
    "it is interesting to use the generalized geometric measure as a measure of multiparty quantum correlations because    * it is a measure of _ genuine _ multiparty entanglement , and * it is easy to compute for pure states of an arbitrary number of parties and in arbitrary dimensions .      in this subsection , we will establish a structure in the space spanned by the quantum monogamy score for a chosen quantum correlation measure and ggm for arbitrary three - qubit pure states .",
    "we will show that arbitrary points in these two - dimensional spaces are not accessible to quantum states .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the generalized ghz states form the boundaries of the respective accessible regions .",
    "the class of generalized ghz states is formed by the states @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 being real and positive , and @xmath71 @xcite . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are two orthonormal states .",
    "we prove the analytical relations for the cases when the chosen quantum correlation measure in the definition of quantum monogamy score is either concurrence squared or quantum discord .",
    "we introduce some notations .",
    "consider an arbitrary pure three - qubit state @xmath73 .",

    ", the ggm of @xmath12 reduces to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath81 , and similarly for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we will see below that `` the party ( among @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) which contributes the maximal schmidt coefficient in the ggm '' , that is the party ( among @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) whose maximal eigenvalue of local density matrix attains the maximum in eq .",
    "( [ ekhono - mughalsarai - aseni ] ) , has an intimate connection with the quantum monogamy score .",

    "( [ ekhono - mughalsarai - aseni ] ) is attained in @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "then , from the definition of ggm and some simple algebra , we get @xmath101 which is in contradiction with the inequality in ( [ nawapatra - ba - eirokom - kichhu - ekta - namer - station - gyalo ] ) .",
    "similar inequalities that are contradictory to the inequalities in ( [ nodalbc ] ) can be obtained when the maximum is attained by @xmath102 or @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath103    * remark : * the entanglement monogamy score of an arbitrary pure three - qubit state lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "and for all @xmath104 $ ] , there is a generalized ghz state , whose entanglement monogamy score is @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the ( two - dimensional ) half - cone -like structure obtained in theorem 1 contains state - points for all three - qubit pure states .",
    "theorem 1 therefore predicts an inverted two - dimensional conical shape for the state points in the @xmath106 plane , with one arm being vertical , and the other curved upwards .",
    "the curved line of the cone corresponds to generalized ghz states , and the vertical line is the ggm axis .",
    "precisely , the curved line can be represented by the equation @xmath107 the vertical line is , of course , represented by the equation @xmath108 .",
    "the tangent to the curved line at the tip of the cone ( i.e. at the point where both ggm and entanglement monogamy score vanish ) makes a nonzero angle with the axis of entanglement monogamy score .",
    "the tangent of this nonzero angle is @xmath109 .",
    "in analogy with the space - time light cone , the tangent to the curved line and the ggm axis form the `` light cone '' of ggm and entanglement monogamy deficit . in this analogous `` relativity '' ,",

    "just like events can not occur outside the space - time light cone , multiparty quantum states can not appear outside the light cone formed by entanglement monogamy deficit and ggm .",
    "there are many entanglement measures that have been defined @xcite , and it is important to try to find a thread that connects them .",
    "the cone - like structure obtained in theorem 1 implies a relation between the two multiparty entanglement measures .",
    "precisely , it states that for three - qubit pure states , the ggm and the entanglement monogamy score ( 3-tangle ) are restricted by the relation @xmath112      we will now prove a result for discord monogamy score , parallel to the one obtained in sec .",
    "[ dos - ta - beyallis - atkgmarg ] .",
    "the situation here is richer than that for entanglement monogamy score , and the complete picture is presented in two parts in the two following theorems .",

    "this will give us a pictorial view of the results presented in theorems 2a and 2b . in fig .",

    "as expected from theorems 2a and 2b , they again form an inverted two - dimensional conical shape , with the tip of the cone being at the point where the ggm and the discord monogamy score are both zero , with the bounding curve being represented by the equations @xmath142 it is interesting to note that the obtained cone is independent of the chosen nodal observer .      despite the similarities ,",
    "there are interesting differences between the conical shapes obtained for entanglement monogamy score and discord monogamy score :    * there are two curved lines that form the cone on the plane of discord monogamy score and ggm , while that in the plane of entanglement monogamy score and ggm is formed out of one curved line and a straight ( vertical ) line .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that while the 3-tangle respects monogamy ( entanglement monogamy score is always positive @xcite ) , quantum discord does not ( discord monogamy score can be both negative and positive @xcite ) . *",
    "the tangent to the curved lines at the tip of the cone is the discord monogamy score axis . in other words , @xmath149 , while @xmath150 .",
    "it is interesting to note here that discord monogamy score is closely related to the multiparty information - theoretic quantum correlation measure called dissension @xcite .",
    "dissension is defined as the difference between the three - variable mutual information with conditional entropies involving no measurements , and with measurements on various subsystems @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that there can be different kinds of dissensions depending on the type of measurement involved .",
    "the definition we choose here is presented below .",
    "+ * definition i : * the quantum mutual information of a three - party quantum state @xmath1 is defined as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ qmi1 ] ) , and the unmeasured conditional quantum mutual information is defined as @xmath153 with @xmath154 in the same spirit as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we can define the three - party classical mutual information for the quantum state @xmath1 as @xmath155 where @xmath156 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ cmi1 ] ) , and the measured conditional quantum mutual information is defined as @xmath157 where the quantum conditional entropies are defined in eqns .",

    "dissension can now be defined as @xmath158    note that that in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are two kinds of dissension used which involves single - particle and two - particle measurements separately . in contrast , the variety of dissension defined here involves both single - particle and two - particle measurements on @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively .",
    "+ * proposition i : * for a tripartite quantum state @xmath1 , the dissension @xmath161 , the negative of discord monogamy score of @xmath1 .",
    "+ ` proof : ` we have @xmath162\\nonumber\\\\ & = & d(\\rho_{ab})-\\left[i(\\rho_{a : b|c})-j(\\rho_{a : b|c})\\right].\\nonumber \\ ] ] using the definitions of @xmath163 and @xmath164 , given in eqns .",
    "( [ eq : qmidis ] ) and ( [ eq : cmidis ] ) respectively , we have @xmath165 hence the proof .",
    "@xmath103    there is an ongoing effort to connect the quantum correlation measures defined in the two main paradigms , viz .",
    "the entanglement - separability and the information - theoretic ones .",
    "@xcite . the theorems 2a and 2b obtained in this paper tries to find similar connections in the multipartite domain .",
    "precisely , we find that for pure three - qubit states , the generalized geometric measure ( a genuine _ multisite entanglement _ measure ) and the discord monogamy score ( a _ multisite information - theoretic _ quantum correlation measure , via proposition i ) , are constrained by @xmath166",
    "the monogamy relation is an important tool to decipher the structure of the space of quantum correlation measures .",
    "there are measures that satisfy and those that violate this relation .",
    "we have shown that given a certain amount of violation or satisfaction of the monogamy relation , the allowed range of the genuine multisite entanglement content of the corresponding pure three - qubit state is distinctly restricted .",
    "the quantum states of the corresponding system is thereby restricted to remain within an envelope in the plane formed by the quantum monogamy score and genuine multiparty entanglement .",
    "we have used the generalized geometric measure for quantifying genuine multiparty entanglement .",
    "quantum monogamy score , on the other hand , is defined by using two measures of bipartite quantum correlation ",
    "first by using the square of the concurrence , and then by quantum discord .",
    "the relations thus obtained between quantum monogamy scores and genuine multiparty entanglement , currently only for pure three - qubit states , is akin to that between space and time in the theory of relativity .",
    "the quantum monogamy score , defined by using concurrence squared , has been proposed as a measure of multipartite entanglement .",
    "also , quantum monogamy score , defined by using quantum discord , is very similar to a proposed information - theoretic measure of multiparty quantum correlation , called dissension .",
    "therefore , the results obtained imply that just like space and time are intertwined in the theory of relativity and thereby future event points are constrained to lie within the future cone , the apparently different multiparty quantum correlation concepts can be intertwined , thereby constraining the multipartite quantum state space within a conical structure .",
    "we hope that a better picture will emerge in future that will unify the multiparticle entanglement measures and multiparticle correlations .",
    "we believe that our results form a first step in this direction .",
