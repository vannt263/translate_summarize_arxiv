    "building upon the initial x - ray observations of @xcite , the chandra deep field south ( cdfs , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) has quickly become one of the most well - studied extragalactic fields in the sky with existing observations among the deepest at a broad range of wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; elbaz et al .  in prep ) . in the coming years",
    ", this status as one of the very deepest multiwavelength survey fields will be further cemented by the ongoing and upcoming extremely - deep observations with _ spitzer_/irac and _ hst_/wfc3-ir as part of the spitzer extended deep survey ( seds , pi g.  fazio ) and the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , @xcite ) , respectively .    despite the large commitment of telescope time from both space- and",
    "ground - based facilities devoted to imaging the cdfs , spectroscopic observations in the field have generally lagged those in other , comparably - deep extragalactic survey fields .",
    "for example , in the extended groth strip , another deep field targeted by the seds and candels programs , the deep2 and deep3 galaxy redshift surveys ( @xcite ; cooper et al .  in prep ; see also @xcite ) have created a vast spectroscopic database , achieving an impressive @xmath9 redshift completeness down to @xmath1 across more than @xmath10 square degrees and @xmath11 completeness covering a broader area of @xmath12 square degrees down to the same magnitude limit .",
    "similarly , there have been a variety of spectroscopic efforts in the goods - n field including the team keck redshift survey ( tkrs , * ? ? ?",

    "together , these datasets provide spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath13 of sources down to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these large spectroscopic surveys add significant scientific utility to the associated imaging datasets , making the photometric constraints much more powerful .",
    "for example , spectroscopic redshifts allow critical rest - frame quantities to be derived with increased precision .",
    "furthermore , only through spectroscopy can assorted spectral and dynamical properties ( such as the strengths and velocity widths of emission and absorption lines ) be measured  in this regard , the spectral databases provided by surveys such as deep2 , deep3 , and tkrs are especially powerful due to their uniform spectral range and resolution . finally , only with the combination of high ( and relatively uniform ) sampling density , spatial coverage across a modestly - sized field ( e.g. , @xmath15 square degrees ) , and moderately high - precision spectroscopic redshifts ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) can the local galaxy density ( or `` environment '' ) be measured across a broad and continuous range of environments @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the egs and goods - n fields , the spectroscopic redshift completeness across the extended @xmath17 area of the cdfs is modest , @xmath18 down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21 , despite some significant spectroscopic efforts in the field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "notably , many of these existing spectroscopic programs have focused their efforts on the smaller goods - s region and/or targeted optically - faint , higher - redshift @xmath22 sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "finally , in section [ sec_future ] , we conclude with a discussion of future work related to aces . throughout , we employ a lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath25cdm ) cosmology with @xmath26 , @xmath27 = 0.3 , @xmath28 , and a hubble parameter of @xmath29 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 .",

    "the primary spectroscopic sample is magnitude limited at @xmath31 , plus a significant population of fainter sources down to @xmath32 .",
    "altogether , aces observations spanned four separate observing seasons ( 2007b  2010b ) , with the details of the target - selection algorithm and slitmask - design parameters varying from year to year . here",
    ", we highlight the critical elements of the composite target population and slitmasks , including any significant variations from mask to mask .    as stated above , the primary target sample for aces was selected according to an @xmath33-band magnitude limit of @xmath34 .",
    "selecting in @xmath33 ( versus a redder passband such as @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) ensures the highest possible signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum of the resulting optical spectra , and thus a high redshift - success rate for the survey .",
    "the given magnitude limit was adopted to enable a high level of completeness to be reached across the entire cdfs area . moreover , at @xmath37 , the @xmath38 limit reaches @xmath39 along the red sequence and @xmath40 magnitude fainter than @xmath39 in the blue cloud population @xcite , thereby enabling aces to probe the systems that dominate the galaxy luminosity density and global star - formation rate at @xmath6 . as shown in figure [ fig_sampling_rate ] , aces is highly - complete at @xmath4 , achieving a targeting rate of @xmath41 across the extended cdfs .",
    "in addition to the main @xmath4 target sample , we prioritized @xmath42 m sources detected as part of the far - infrared deep extragalactic legacy ( fidel ) survey ( pi : m.  dickinson ) , which surveyed the cdfs to extremely deep flux limits at both @xmath43 m and @xmath42 m with _",
    "@xcite . in selecting the optical counterparts to the @xmath42 m sources",
    ", we utilized a fainter magnitude limit of @xmath44 , targeting multiple optical sources in cases for which the identity of the optical counterpart was ambiguous . in total , aces prioritized @xmath45 sources as @xmath42 m counterparts , with @xmath46 of these sources also meeting the @xmath4 primary magnitude limit for the survey . for the @xmath42m - selected target population ,",
    "our redshift success rate is quite high ( @xmath47 versus @xmath48 for the full target population ) .    as a filler population in the target - selection process ,",
    "we also included ( with a lower selection probability ) all sources down to the secondary magnitude limit of @xmath49 .",
    "these fainter , optically - selected sources comprise roughly @xmath50 of the total unique target sample ( i.e , @xmath51 sources ) .",
    "the @xmath44 limit was adopted to match that of the deep2 survey and allows the aces dataset to probe even farther down the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath6 .    to maximize the sampling density of the survey at @xmath52 ,",
    "stellar sources were down - weighted in the target selection process .",
    "stars were identified according to the spectral classification of @xcite , which utilized template sed fits to the @xmath53-band photometry of combo-17 .",
    "all sources classified as `` star '' or `` wdwarf '' by @xcite were down - weighted in the target selection .",
    "this included a total of @xmath54 sources at @xmath4 , of which we targeted @xmath55 obtaining secure redshifts for @xmath56 .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig_sampling_rate ] , these stellar sources are only a significant contribution to the total @xmath33-band number counts at bright @xmath57 magnitudes ; excluding this population of stars from the accounting , aces targets @xmath58 of sources at @xmath4 .    in selecting the aces spectroscopic targets , we also down - weighted many sources with an existing spectroscopic redshift in the literature .",
    "this sample of `` public '' redshifts was drawn from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as well as a small set of proprietary redshifts measured by the deep2 galaxy redshift survey using keck / deimos . in all cases ,",
    "only secure redshifts were employed .",
    "for example , only quality `` a '' and `` b '' ( not `` c '' ) redshifts were included from @xcite . at @xmath59 , a total of @xmath60 unique sources with a spectroscopic redshift",
    "were down - weighted in the target selection process , with @xmath61 of these sources at @xmath4 .",
    "a significant number of objects ( @xmath62 ) in this public catalog were observed by aces ; a comparison of the aces redshift measurements to those previously published is presented in  [ sec_data ] .",
    "note that some of these public redshifts ( most notably those of @xcite ) were not yet published prior to the commencement of aces , but were included in the target selection process as the survey progressed .",
    "also , the distribution of the existing spectroscopic redshifts on the sky is strongly biased towards the center of the extended cdfs , primarily covering the smaller goods - s region ( see fig .  [ fig_sampling_map ] ) .",
    "for the 2007b through 2009b observing seasons , slitmasks were designed in pairs , sharing a common position and orientation . by placing two masks at the same location on the sky ,",
    "objects had multiple chances to be included on a slitmask ( and thus observed ) .",
    "furthermore , we were able to integrate longer on fainter targets by including those sources on both of the masks at a given position , while only including brighter sources on a single mask and thus maximizing the number of sources observed .",
    "as discussed in ",
    "[ sec_future ] , data for objects appearing on multiple slitmasks have yet to be combined ; at present , each slitmask is analyzed independently , such that there are a higher number of repeated observations of some objects ( especially fainter targets ) .",
    "the tiling scheme for the @xmath63 imacs slitmasks was designed to cover the extended @xmath3 area of the extended cdfs , with the caveat that the position and orientation of each slitmask was dictated by the availability of suitably bright stars for guiding and dynamic focusing .",
    "a moderate resolution grism and wide - band ( @xmath64@xmath65 ) filter were employed in the observations ( see  [ sec_redux ] ) , allowing multiple ( @xmath66@xmath67 ) targets to occupy a given spatial position on a slitmask and thereby enable upwards of @xmath68 sources to be observed on a single slitmask .",
    "the average number of targets per mask was @xmath69 , with the details of the slitmask design varying slightly from year to year of observing .",
    "for all of the aces slitmasks , a standard @xmath70 slitwidth was employed , with a minimum slitlength of @xmath71 ( centered on the target ) and a gap of at least @xmath72 between slits . for a subset of the slitmasks",
    ", slits were extended to fill otherwise unoccupied real estate on the slitmask . on every mask , the set of possible targets",
    "was restricted to those sources for which the entire spectral range of @xmath64@xmath65  would fall on the detector , given the position and orientation of the mask .",
    "the location of the slitmasks on the sky was selected such that the full area of the mask would fall within the cdfs region , leading to a slitmask tiling scheme that more highly samples the central portion of the field .",
    "this relative oversampling is a direct product of the large size of the imacs field - of - view at f/2 ( @xmath73 unvignetted ) ; any imacs slitmask that falls entirely within the extended cdfs region will overlap the central portion of the cdfs , independent of orientation . as shown in figure [ fig_tiling ] , the number of aces slitmasks at a given position within the cdfs varies significantly from @xmath74 at the center of the field to @xmath75 at the edges .    in spite of this spatial variation in the total sampling rate , aces",
    "achieves a relatively uniform spatial sampling rate for the main @xmath76 galaxy sample . as evident in figure",
    "[ fig_sampling_map ] , aces targets @xmath41 of sources at @xmath4 , relatively independent of position within the cdfs .",
    "when including spectroscopic observations from the literature ( counting the associated objects as being observed ) , the target sampling is remarkably complete at @xmath77 , with roughly half of the @xmath3 cdfs surveyed to @xmath78 completeness .",
    "this relatively high and uniform sampling rate is critical for the ability to measure local environments with the aces dataset .",
    "aces spectroscopic observations employed the f/2 camera in the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on the magellan - baade telescope and were completed across four separate observing seasons ( 2007b  2010b ) as detailed in table [ tab_obs ] .",
    "the instrument set - up included the 200 lines mm@xmath30 grism ( blaze angle of @xmath79 ) in conjunction with the wb56509200 wide - band filter , which yields a nominal spectral coverage of @xmath64@xmath65at a resolution of @xmath80 ( at @xmath81 ) .",
    "each slitmask was observed for a total integration time of @xmath82@xmath83 sec , divided into ( at least ) @xmath67@xmath84 individual @xmath85@xmath86 sec integrations ( with no dithering performed ) to facilitate the rejection of cosmic rays  see table [ tab_obs ] for details regarding the total integration times . immediately following each set of science exposures ( i.e. , without moving the telescope or modifying the instrument configuration ) , a quartz flat - field frame and comparison arc spectrum ( using he , ar , ne ) were taken to account for instrument flexure and detector fringing .",
    "there are two notable variations in the instrument configuration that occurred in the course of the aces observations . between the 2007b ( january 2008 ) and 2008b ( november 2008 ) observing seasons",
    ", the imacs ccds were upgraded from the original site to deep - depletion e2v chips @xcite .",
    "the new ccds provided much improved quantum efficiency , especially at red wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the detector update , for the initial observing run ( in january 2008 ) , the data were collected using the incorrect grism . instead of the 200 lines mm@xmath30 grism ,",
    "the higher - resolution 300 lines mm@xmath30 grism ( blaze angle of @xmath87 ) was installed in imacs .",
    "the resulting spectra from those slitmasks ( aces1aces8 ) are therefore at slightly higher resolution ( @xmath88 at @xmath81 ) . given that the slitmasks multiplex in the spectral ( in addition to the spatial ) direction and were designed for use with the lower - resolution grism , the spectra for many objects overlap significantly .",
    "in addition , for a subset of the objects ( primarily those located closer to the edge of the slitmask ) , part of the @xmath64@xmath65  spectral window was dispersed off of the imacs detector . in such instances , on the order of @xmath89",
    "was typically lost at either the blue or red extreme of the spectral window .",
    "while the data taken on this first observing run were negatively impacted by the use of the incorrect grism ( including a slight reduction in total throughput ) , redshifts were still able to be measured for many of the targets . in an attempt to maintain the uniformity of the dataset",
    ", however , the vast majority of the objects on the aces1aces8 slitmasks ( 1166 of 1315 objects ) were reobserved in subsequent observing seasons .",
