    "there is currently significant debate as to the physical mechanisms responsible for the continuum of x - ray spectrally `` hard states '' of black hole candidates ( bhc ) accreting in binaries .",
    "this debate ranges from the broader issue of whether or not there is a significant contribution to the x - ray band from an outflow or jet , to more narrowly focused issues within given classes of models .",
    "for instance , the hard x - ray emission has traditionally been attributed to a comptonizing thermal corona ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these earlier works generally favor a scenario where the corona lies central to a truncated outer thin disk .",
    "however , if the corona is driven outwards by radiative pressure could it instead overlay the inner disk ?",
    "can the optically thick , geometrically thin disk extend inward nearly to the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite ? is this disk cold ( peak temperatures of a few hundred ev ) , or can it instead be hot ( near a kev ,",
    "i.e. , @xcite ) ? is the hard state corona comprised primarily of electrons with a thermal population @xcite , or can it have a substantial contribution from a non - thermal electron population @xcite ? does the bulk motion of the flow play a role in comptonizing the spectrum @xcite ? alternatively could the x - rays be comprised of a combination of direct synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission from a jet @xcite ? contributing to the debate , however , is the fact that many of the above cited models , especially when considering solely _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) data in the 3200kev range ( or even narrower energy ranges ) , describe the hard state spectra nearly equally well .",
    "to study these issues , over the past decade we have been using a series of pointed , approximately bi - weekly , _",
    "rxte_observations of the bhc cyg  x-1performed simultaneously with 15ghz radio observations by the ryle telescope .",
    "cyg  x-1holds much promise for exploring the current range of questions listed above owing to its persistently bright x - ray flux ( including both the hard and soft states , it varies between 200600mcrab in the 1.212 kev band covered by the _",
    "rxte_-all sky monitor ) and its correlated radio / x - ray spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . extended radio emission even has been imaged in cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "this campaign has already provided the spectra for some of the comptonization models @xcite , and jet models @xcite discussed above .",
    "additionally , these data have been used to to study the correlation of the x - ray and radio spectral properties on both long time scales @xcite , and short time scales ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bck et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "thus they comprise a strong data set for addressing not only the details of the x - ray spectrum , but also the connection to the hard state jets which are known to dominate the radio through near - infrared emission .",
    "simultaneous radio / x - ray flaring has also been detected in cyg  x-1during this extended campaign ( @xcite , @xcite ) , lending support to the hypothesis of x - ray emission by the jet .    _",
    "rxte_spectral data alone , however , do not allow us to break the current existing `` theoretical degeneracy '' in the origin of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the statistically best fits are in fact obtained with purely empirical simple broken powerlaws with a break occurring between 912kev , and an exponential cutoff occurring at > 20kev , to which a broad , @xmath2kev gaussian line is added @xcite .",
    "the latter component is likely attributable to a relativistically broadened fe k@xmath3 line ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; however , its parameters are dependent upon the assumed continuum model @xcite .",
    "more physically motivated comptonization and outflow - dominated models @xcite can describe the same spectra almost as well .",
    "however they must introduce additional , albeit plausible , physical components ( e.g. , relativistic smearing ) to recover the simple spectra of the broken powerlaw description .",
    "thus , there is some amount of ambiguity when correlating detailed spectral features vs. continuum properties , e.g. , disk reflection vs. coronal compactness / hardness , as the detailed features systematically depend upon the underlying broad - band continuum .    despite these problems in finding a truly unique spectral model , when considering multiple observations taken over a wide range of luminosities and spectral hardnesses , spectral correlations arise that are robust and persistent across a variety of these theoretical characterizations @xcite . using the broken powerlaw models as a simple description of the x - ray spectra",
    ", we have found that when the 210kev photon index @xmath4 there is a positive correlation between x - ray and radio flux , whereas for @xmath5 there is a negative correlation between the x - ray and radio flux .",
    "we therefore use the value of @xmath6 as the canonical division between the spectrally `` hard state '' and the spectrally `` soft state '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , as the spectra become harder , exponential cutoffs tend to become less significant ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "suzaku_cyg  x-1observation occurred in 2005 october @xcite . during this observation cyg",
    "x-1  was in a relatively bright hard state ( the _ rxte_-asmcount rate was @xmath11cps ) , the spacecraft aimpoint was placed on the _ suzaku_-x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) detectors , and _",
    "suzaku_was run in a data - mode with 1s integrations per ccd exposure frame . as discussed by (",
    "* see also the appendix ) , this long exposure led to both telemetry dropouts and severe photon pileup on the detectors .",
    "as these issues require a more complex analysis @xcite , we do not consider these data further .",
    "the four _ suzaku_observations discussed here occurred during times when the _ rxte_-asmflux ranged from 1223cps , the spacecraft pointing was set to the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; this slightly reduces the flux on the xisdetectors ) , and the ccd exposure frame integration times were set to @xmath12s .",
    "thus , our observations do not suffer from telemetry dropouts and they are less severely affected by photon pileup .",
    "all four of these observations occurred simultaneously with",
    "_ rxte_observations .",
    "the last of these observations also occurred simultaneously with observations by every other x - ray / soft gamma - ray instrument flying at that time ( hanke et al .",

    "an observing log is presented in table  [ tab : lo ] .",

    "xis2 was lost due to a micrometeor hit in late 2006 , and thus was available only for the first observation ( see table [ tab : lo ] ) . for our fourth observation , xis0",
    "was run in continuous readout mode , which is not yet fully calibrated , so we do not include these data in this work .    in preparing the xisspectra , we first corrected each detector for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) using the ` xispi ` tool , and then reprocessed the data with ` xselect ` using the standard ` xisrepro ` selection criteria .",
    "due to thermal flexing of the spacecraft , the attitude of the _ suzaku_spacecraft exhibits variability over the course of the observations and therefore the image of the source is not at a fixed position on the ccd .",
    "standard processing reduces this variability and improves the psf image @xcite ; however , with the standard tools it is not possible yet to correct fully the blurring caused by the varying attitude . as described in the appendix , for bright sources a better reconstruction of the attitude solution , and thus narrower psf images ,",
    "can be obtained using the ` aeattcor.sl ` software .",
    "we produced such an improved image and then used the ` pile_estimate.sl ` ` s - lang ` script described in the appendix to estimate the degree of pileup in the observations . for the spectra described in this work ,",
    "using the time filter criteria described in  [ sec : lightcurves ] , the center of the psf images could be affected by as much as a 35% pileup fraction .",
    "we therefore extracted annular regions wherein we excised the @xmath16 radius central region .",
    "the excised data accounted for approximately 1/3 of the detected events .",
    "the outer radii of our annular extraction regions were limited by the 1/4 sub - array used in our ccd readout mode , and thus were @xmath17 .",
    "we estimate that the extracted events had @xmath18 mean residual pileup fraction .",
    "all regions of the ccd are dominated by source counts , therefore we did not extract nor use any background spectra for the xisobservations .",
    "events in the xisdetectors were read out from either @xmath19 or @xmath20 pixel islands .",
    "the xis1 data were always in @xmath19-mode , whereas the other detectors had mixtures of @xmath19- and @xmath20-mode .",

    "good time intervals ( gti ) were merged from our time selections (  [ sec : lightcurves ] ) and the combination of the gti intervals from the source and background event files .",
    "these intersected intervals were then used to extract the pinsource and background spectra .",
    "the source spectra exposure times were then corrected with the ` hxdtcorr ` tool .",
    "the pinspectra were grouped to have a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath21 in each energy bin , and we considered spectra between 1270kev .    the gsospectra were created starting with the `` unfiltered '' event files .",
    "these data were first reprocessed with the ` hxdtime ` , ` hxdpi ` , and ` hxdgrade ` tools , following the `` _ _ suzaku abc guide _ _ '' .",

    "the grouping of the gsospectra is essentially fixed by the grouping of the background file , thus no rebinning was performed on these spectra .",
    "it was determined that the background becomes prohibitive above 300kev ; therefore , we restrict the gsospectra to the 60300kev range .      the _ rxte_data were prepared with tools from the heasoft v6.8 package and the most current calibration files as of 2010 january 10 .",
    "we used standard filtering criteria for data from the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",

    "we used the background models appropriate to bright data .",
    "we applied 0.5% systematic errors to all pca  channels , added in quadrature to the errors calculated from the data count rate . for all pca  fits we grouped the data starting at @xmath23kev with the criteria that the signal - to - noise ( after background subtraction , but excluding systematic errors ) in each bin had to be @xmath24 .",
    "we restricted the noticed energy range to 322kev .",
    "we extracted data from the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the same criteria as for the pca .",
    "hexteis comprised of two clusters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "prior to 2007 , both clusters were in a rocking mode , with only one detector viewing the source at a given time , while the other detector conducted off - source background measurements .",
    "for later dates ( e.g. , our three most recent observations ) , hextea has been in a fixed on - source position , which required us to estimate cluster a backgrounds using the ` hextebackest ` tool .",
    "furthermore , during our third observation there was clear evidence for a hextea exposure anomaly .",
    "we found evidence for such an anomaly ( albeit less severe ) in our second observation as well .",
    "we corrected the hextea exposure time by iteratively fitting an exponentially cutoff powerlaw simultaneously to both cluster a and b data and varying the exposure of cluster a until a @xmath27 minimum was achieved using the same normalization for both detectors .",
    "we binned the hextespectra to a common grid such that they had a minimum combined signal - to - noise of 8 in each energy channel ( even though both clusters were fit individually ) .",
    "we further restricted the noticed energy range to 18200kev .",
    "additionally , when fitting the x - ray spectra we allowed the normalization of the hextebackgrounds to vary .",
    "( the best fit normalization constants were typically within @xmath28 of unity . )    for both pcaand hextespectra we further restricted the considered time intervals to those that were strictly simultaneous with the _ suzaku_spectra .",
    "that is , the _ rxte_time intervals form a subset of the _ suzaku_time intervals .",
    "the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was inserted for our observation of cyg  x-1 , with the data readout mode being timed exposure - graded .",
    "the hetg  is comprised of the high energy gratings ( heg ) , with coverage from @xmath298kev , and the medium energy gratings ( meg ) , with coverage from @xmath308kev . to minimize pileup in the gratings spectra ,",
    "a 1/2 subarray was applied to the ccds .",
    "additionally , the observatory aimpoint was placed closer to the ccd readout .",
    "this configuration reduces the frame time to 1.741sec , without any loss of the dispersed spectrum .",
    "we used ` ciao v4.2 ` and ` caldb v4.2.0 ` to extract the data and create the spectral response files .",
    "the location of the center of the @xmath31  order image was determined using the ` findzo.sl ` routine , which provides @xmath32 pixel ( @xmath33 , for meg ) accuracy .",
    "the data were reprocessed with pixel randomization turned off , but pha randomization left on .",
    "we applied the standard grade and bad pixel file filters , but we did not destreak the data .",
    "although the instrumental set up was designed to minimize pileup , it is still present in both the meg  and , to a lesser extent , the hegspectra .",
    "we incorporate the effects of pileup in our spectral fits using the ` simple_gpile2 ` model @xcite based upon the model originally described by @xcite . for the small amount of pileup present in these data ,",
    "this model is extremely successful in describing its effect on the spectra .    as for the pcaand hextespectra",
    ", we restricted the considered time intervals for the _ chandra_spectra to those that were strictly simultaneous with the _ suzaku_spectra .      simultaneous _ ryle_radio fluxes are not available for the x - ray observations discussed in this work . owing to the known stringent correlations between the x - ray and radio flux , specifically the correlations between the _ rxte_-asmand _ ryle_fluxes ( see @xcite ) , we use an estimated radio flux when applying the jet model to the spectra (  [ sec : jet ] ) . from our prior observations we average all radio data that occurred at times with asmdaily averages that were within @xmath34 of the asmdaily average corresponding to these new observations",
    "the average and standard deviation of these radio data were used in the spectral fits , which yielded radio fluxes of @xmath35mjy ( 2006 - 10 - 30 ) , @xmath36mjy ( 2007 - 04 - 30 ) , @xmath37mjy ( 2007 - 05 - 17 ) , and @xmath38mjy ( 2008 - 04 - 19 ) .",
    "each average was comprised of a minimum of ten measurements , and the extreme radio flux values within each sample never differed from the average by more than a factor of two .      throughout this work we will present spectra that are `` unfolded '' from the detector response in a model - independent manner ( see * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , we define the unfolded photon flux , @xmath39 , from a pulse height ( pha ) bin , @xmath40 , as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the background subtracted counts , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the detector response matrix and effective area , and @xmath45 is the exposure time . for multiple data sets coadded together for the plots ( e.g. , the _ suzaku_-xisor the _",
    "rxte_-hextedata ) , the numerator and denominator are each replaced with the sum of the same quantities from the detectors . throughout we only sum data for the plots , not for the fits .",
    "model spectra are `` unfolded '' in a similar manner .",
    "that is , predicted background subtracted model counts are first calculated , and then unfolded as above .",
    "thus , the model spectra exhibit the smearing induced by the detector response matrix .",
    "the one exception to this model component scheme is for the jet results presented in  [ sec : jet ] .",
    "there some of the model components are shown unsmeared by the detector response , as they are derived from internal calculations of the jet code .",
    "by design , our fourth observation occurred near binary orbital phase 0 ( superior conjunction of the black hole ) , wherein we expected to be viewing cygnus x-1 through the wind of the secondary . by happenstance , all of our remaining _ suzaku_observations also occurred near superior conjunction , i.e. , observations 14 cover orbital phases 0.20.3 , 0.80.0 , 0.850.0 , and 0.00.14 , respectively .",
    "although dipping events are known to be present during all orbital phases , during upper conjunction dipping is prevalent due to absorption by clumps in the wind @xcite .",
    "this behavior is clearly seen in the _ suzaku_lightcurves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the soft x - ray lightcurve shows a deep , prolonged @xmath46ksec dip .",
    "a less pronounced , but still significant dip is seen in the hard x - ray lightcurve @xcite .",
    "numerous dips of varying levels are also seen on even shorter time scales . in order to extract the unabsorbed spectrum of the source , it is therefore necessary to screen the data for dipping and excise the dipping intervals from further analysis .",
    "in addition to dipping , spectral modeling also has to take into account the strong dust scattering halo in front of cyg  x-1@xcite . as discussed by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , a scattering halo is produced by the scattering of radiation from an x - ray source by a foreground dust cloud .",
    "typical halo sizes are on the order of arcminutes , i.e. , comparable to the size of the _ suzaku_psf .",
    "the energy dependence of the scattering cross section leads to a halo angular size that is @xmath47 and a halo spectrum that is @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , as the scattered photons travel along a greater path length to reach the observer , they are delayed with respect to the directly observed photons by a factor that is proportional to the square of the angular radius from which the scattered photons are observed .",
    "the expected time delays for nearby galactic sources typically range from thousands to tens of thousands of seconds .",
    "thus the _ suzaku_spectrum and lightcurve of cyg  x-1are comprised of two components : a directly observed component , subject to the local dipping events , and a time - delayed and time - averaged ( due to integration over different angular radii ) softer spectrum from the scattering halo .",
    "most spectral analyses in the past have ignored the effects of scattering since to first order for optically thin scattering in a homogeneous cloud , whatever radiation that is scattered out of the line of sight is scattered back in from larger ( often spatially unresolved ) radii .",
    "thus , for spatially unresolved ( on the size scale of the halo ) and steady sources , dust can be ignored in simple analyses .    if one assumes that the time - delayed and time - averaged spectrum is represented by the same model as the direct spectrum , and if one further assumes that interstellar absorption is predominantly in the foreground of the dust halo , within isisone can write the spectral model for the spectra during the dips as : @xmath49 here and throughout we shall use an updated version of the absorption model of @xcite to describe both the interstellar ( model instance 1 ) and local ( model instance 2 ) absorption . the ` dustscat ` model is a version of the xspec  ` dust ` model that removes the optically thin assumption of the latter model , but otherwise ignores multiple scatterings ( f. baganoff , priv",
    ". comm . ) .",
    "note that when local absorption is absent ( tbnew(2 ) @xmath50 ) , the dust scattering term drops out of the model expression .",
    "not all of the assumptions encompassed within the above model expression are necessarily realistic .",
    "specifically , the assumptions that all interstellar absorption is foreground to the dust and that the delayed source spectrum is identical to direct spectrum are undoubtedly wrong in fine detail .",
    "however , we find that the above expression provides a reasonable description of the color - color diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] .",
    "specifically , we create a spectrum from bright phases of the lightcurve that inhabit a locus of points in the upper right hand corner of the color - color diagrams ( i.e. , the filled symbols of fig .  [ fig : colors ] ) .",
    "we fit a simple spectral model to these selected data : an absorbed disk plus powerlaw plus broad and narrow gaussian lines near 6.4kev .",
    "we then apply this model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dust ] ) , and create color - color curves by varying the ` tbnew(2 ) ` component from 0@xmath51 . these curves",
    "are then fit to the color - color diagrams using the optical depth of the dust scattering halo as the single free parameter .",
    "our best fits yield @xmath520.34 , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] .",
    "overall , these curves describe the behavior of the color - color diagrams reasonably well .",
    "the dust halo represents @xmath5330% ( i.e. , on the order of the scattering optical depth ) of the soft x - ray ( @xmath54kev ) flux being `` uncovered '' during the dips .",
    "given the much narrower _",
    "chandra_psf , one would expect comparable _ chandra_color - color diagrams to show a far smaller uncovered fraction if the dust halo interpretation is correct .",
    "this is indeed found to be true , with _ chandra_showing only an @xmath55 uncovered fraction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hanke et al . , in prep . )",
    "however , it is possible that the very low uncovered fraction required by the _ chandra_data might , in fact , be partly intrinsic to the local dipping at the source ( hanke et al . in prep . ) .",
    "note that the theoretical curves show a greater degree of curvature than the observed , nearly linear , evolution toward the lower left hand corner of the diagram .",
    "we hypothesize that this discrepancy is due to our assumption in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dust ] ) of purely neutral absorption in the dips .",

    "for these reasons , we choose the empirical approach outlined above .",
    "several things need to be borne in mind when considering our results : whereas we allow for an overall normalization change in our ionized absorber model , we do not allow for changes of the ionization state . as fig .",
    "[ fig : suzaku_chandra ] shows , with the exception of a weak fe xxv line , there are essentially no ionized lines with energies @xmath66kev . thus it is unlikely that this simple empirical approach will _ directly _ impact , for example , broad fe line studies .",

    "nevertheless , a broad excess is required redward of the fe k@xmath3 line .    in describing the residuals in this region with a broad line , we see that the fe xxv absorption line occurs near the blue wing peak of the relativistically broadened line ( fig .",

    "the 2001/2003 work considered a parameter space where only synchrotron radiation from the jet contributed to the observed x - rays . later work , and the version of the jet model used here , include x - rays produced not only by jet synchrotron radiation , but also by jet synchrotron self - compton processes and comptonization of seed photons from the disk .",
    "the synchrotron component is only mildly beamed , with peak @xmath114 in the radio emitting portions of the jet .",
    "the inverse comptonization component comes from near the jet base where @xmath115 , and thus undergoes very little beaming .",
    "thus , although this does mean that the fitted jet parameters are dependent upon assumed inclination angle ( e.g. , the jet input power , @xmath116 will depend upon assumed inclination ) , given the low @xmath117 values inherent in the model it is possible to find good fit parameters for a wide variety of assumed inclinations .",
    "a full description of the main jet model parameters can be found in the appendix of @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the version of the jet model that we use is closest to that discussed in @xcite ; therefore , we repeat part of the model parameter summary presented there .",
    "we assume a distance of 2.5kpc and an inclination of @xmath87 for the cyg  x-1system .",
    "the jet properties are then determined by the input jet power ( @xmath118 , expressed as a fraction of the eddington luminosity for a 10@xmath119 black hole ) , the electron temperature of the relativistic thermal plasma entering at the jet base ( @xmath120 ) , the ratio of magnetic to particle energy density ( the equipartition factor , @xmath121 ) , the physical dimensions of the jet base ( assumed to be cylindrical with radius @xmath122 and height @xmath123 , the latter fixed to @xmath124 ) , and the location of the point on the jet ( @xmath125 ) beyond which a significant fraction of the leptons are accelerated to a powerlaw energy distribution that follows @xmath126 , with @xmath127 being a fit parameter .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath128 can be physically interpreted as being related to the particle acceleration rate ( which is @xmath129 ; see @xcite ) .    as for the corona - only models ,",
    "we also include emission from a low temperature disk with inner radius @xmath130 and peak temperature @xmath131 .",
    "( this disk is very similar in temperature and normalization to the low temperature disk component included in the comptonization model fits . )",
    "a relativistically broadened fe k@xmath3 line ( with the same emissivity and inclination parameters as for the corona - only models ) is coupled to the disk component by having its inner radius of emission tied to the disk inner radius . a narrow gaussian line",
    "is included , as well as a reflection component ( calculated with the reflect model from ` xspec ` ) .",
    "unlike the reflection model internal to the ` eqpair ` code , the ` reflect ` model , which performs a convolution on any given input spectrum , does not account for relativistic smearing .",
    "the fe edge near 7.1kev in this unsmeared reflected spectrum can produce a sharp feature not seen in the data residuals ; therefore , we smear this component with a unit - normalized , @xmath132kev gaussian convolution .",
    "fit results for this model are presented in table  6 , fig .",
    "[ fig : alljet ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : jet ] .",
    "the overall quality of these fits is quite good , although not quite as good as for the corona - only models discussed above .",
    "the jet models leave slightly larger residuals in the pcaspectra ( near the fe line region and the 10kev region ) , as well as in the gsospectra .",
    "the former could be related to inadequate modeling of the reflection spectrum ( i.e. , not using a relativistically smeared model )",
    ".    fits to the hardest x - ray spectra ( i.e. , the cutoff seen in the gso ) are governed by the jet ssc and the inverse compton components .",
    "this latter component is comprised of a magnetized , beamed corona with a high temperature [ @xmath133@xmath134k , i.e. , @xmath1355mev ] , and low electron scattering optical depth ( @xmath136 ) . a high temperature , low optical depth corona with a limited residence time under those conditions simplifies the jet code by allowing one to use a single scattering approximation for calculating the comptonization spectrum .",
    "the compactness of such a corona , however , could lead to high pair production which would then serve to cool the corona and increase its optical depth ( see , for example , the critique of @xcite ) .",
    "post - facto estimates of the physical self - consistency of fitted jet models are discussed by @xcite who calculate the pair production and annihilation rates at the base of the corona .",
    "fits to the hard state spectra of xte  j1181 + 105 yield far higher annihilation rates than production rates , and therefore represent a self - consistent solution .",
    "fits to the hard state spectra of gx  339@xmath734 yield mixed results . for some cases , annihilation and production rates are comparable and the resulting corona is marginally self - consistent . in other cases ,",
    "the calculated production rates are an order of magnitude higher than annihilation rates , and the resulting coronae are not self - consistent @xcite .",
    "we have performed the same calculations as discussed by @xcite for jet models fitted in this work and find that all yield pair production rates larger than pair annihilation rates .",
    "the coronae within these jet models are therefore not self - consistent .",
    "observation 3 produces a fit that is closest to being self - inconsistent , with pair production and annihilation rates being a factor @xmath14 apart from one another .",
    "jet fits to the other observations are further from self - consistency .",
    "such inconsistencies were similarly true for early coronal models , e.g. , those based upon the work of @xcite .",
    "a number of such `` slab geometry '' coronae , in order to produce the hardest x - ray spectra observed in sources such as cyg  x-1 , used coronal temperatures ( apart from any consideration of pair production ) that were unachievable in those geometries ( see the discussion of this issue by @xcite ) .",
    "such inconsistencies were in fact what led to the development of more physically self - consistent coronal models , e.g. , the ` kotelp ` model of @xcite and @xcite and the ` eqpair ` model of @xcite .",
    "we consider these jet models , however , as they are as of yet the only spectral models that make a serious attempt to explain the correlated radio spectra .",
    "future iterations of these models will incorporate consideration of pair production , as well as synchrotron and ssc cooling of the compton corona ( peer & markoff , in prep . ) .",
    "( as shown by @xcite and others , coronal cooling can be a more significant consideration than pair production in some situations . )",
    "the derived parameters are similar to those found for fits to other bhc ( see the fits to xte  j1118 + 105 and gx  339@xmath734 presented by @xcite ) . the power input at the base of the jet , in terms of eddington luminosity , is comparable to the inferred bolometric luminosity ( i.e. , compare the values of @xmath116 to the values of table  [ tab : flux ] ; although different inclination assumptions will alter the value of @xmath116 , given the low @xmath117 values in the jet , it is always comparable to the inferred system luminosity ) .",
    "the radius of the base of the jet is comparable to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the largest fit value exceeds the isco for a schwarzschild black hole by only a factor of 11 .",
    "the shock acceleration distance along the jet , @xmath125 ranges from @xmath137430@xmath0 .",
    "the former value is comparable to that found for xte  j1118 + 105 , while the latter is comparable to that found for gx  339@xmath734 . as discussed above , the fitted coronal electron temperatures at the base of the jet range from @xmath133@xmath138k .",
    "work in progress suggests that a physically self - consistent coronal temperature that properly accounts for the dominant effects of synchrotron and ssc cooling may truncate the allowed range of coronal temperatures to the lower end found here ( peer & markoff , in prep . ) .",
    "future versions of the jet code will explicitly account for these effects .",
    "for all the fits presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet ] , both synchrotron and ssc radiation make substantial contributions to observed x - ray spectra .",
    "this is an important point to which we shall return in  [ sec : discuss ] .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : line_comp ] we show the fe line region residuals for the two compton corona models and the jet model .",
    "these residuals are derived by setting the line normalizations ( including absorption line normalizations ) to zero , _ without _ refitting .",
    "they are also different from line residuals that are often used for illustrative purposes where only a portion of the continuum outside of the line region is fit with a simple powerlaw ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : total_line ] ) .",
    "the residuals in fig .",
    "[ fig : line_comp ] are meant to highlight the _",
    "differences _ in the derived line parameters for the three main continuum models discussed here .    as shown by the parameters in tables  46 , there are indeed differences among the inferred line parameters .",
    "for the most part , the purely thermal comptonization model yields the strongest line equivalent widths , while the non - thermal comptonization model yields the weakest equivalent widths ( by up to a factor of two ) .",
    "the thermal comptonization model usually also yields the smallest inner radii for the relativistically broadened line , in some cases extending all the way to the isco for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "larger values of these radii , however , are typically found with the other two models .",
    "these differences are evident in the lower energy residuals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_line ] .    to be clear , a substantially broadened line is _ required _ by _ all _ spectral models that we have explored , and there is a good agreement between the pcaand",
    "_ suzaku_-xisresiduals regarding this fact .",
    "we also reiterate that for all explored models , the equivalent width of the fitted narrow line ( typically @xmath139ev ) is only a fraction of that for the broad line , and is in fact substantially smaller than the fe line equivalent width we have found for any model that we have applied to any _ rxte_observation of cyg  x-1@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for these four observations , we have not found any implied inner radius greater than @xmath140 .",
    "the precise details of this broadened line , however , do depend upon the assumed continuum model .",
    "in this work we present broad band ( 0.8300kev ) fits to four separate observations of cyg  x-1that have simultaneous _ suzaku_and _ rxte_data .",
    "the most recent of these observations also has simultaneous _ chandra_-hetgdata .",
    "each of these observations shows evidence of dipping events likely due to dense structures ( `` clumps '' ) in the otherwise highly ionized wind of the secondary .",
    "this is seen in the lightcurves ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) , and the color - color diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] , which can be modeled by the presence of a dust scattering halo ) .",
    "the ionized absorption is very significant in the _ suzaku_spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : suzaku_chandra ] ) even though in this work we consider the least absorbed periods of the lightcurve .",
    "* modeling the ionized line absorption present in cyg  x-1 , via the use of parameterized fits to the hetgspectra , is crucial for deriving good fits to the soft x - ray spectra seen by _ suzaku_and _",
    "rxte_.    we note that even accounting for this ionized absorption , the spectral fits presented in this paper yield reduced @xmath141 that range from 1.82.5 .",
    "do such values truly represent good fits to these data ?",
    "cyg  x-1is bright , and these observations are of sufficient length that the signal - to - noise values for these spectra are quite high .",
    "the spectra are dominated by systematic errors , especially at the soft x - ray energies .",
    "we already have added 0.5% systematic errors to the pcaspectra , which is a reasonable estimate for the _ internal _ uncertainty of the pca .",
    "there are also relative uncertainties among the detectors . for observation 4 ,",
    "if we increase the pcasystematic errors to 1% , add 1% systematic errors to the hextea cluster ( i.e. , the fixed cluster ) , and add 3% systematic errors to the _ suzaku_-xisspectra , then the fits presented here would have reduced @xmath142 . comparing the fits among the individual xisspectra ( representing both different individual detectors and different data acquisition modes ) , we have found that @xmath143 is a reasonable estimate of the end - to - end differences among these spectra .",
    "we hypothesize that the quality of the fits presented here is near `` optimal '' given the current internal and relative calibrations of these detectors .",
    "the observations that occurred on 2007 may 17 , i.e. , the third set of observations , are potentially the most problematic in turns of cross - calibration issues . for our other sets of observations ,",
    "the _ rxte_-pcadata act as a `` bridge '' between the _ suzaku_-xisand -pinspectra .",
    "each can have its relative normalization anchored by a comparison to the pca , which overlaps the energy coverage of both detectors .",
    "this is lacking in the third observation , leading to the worry that changes in the normalization constant are subsuming , for example , continuum spectra associated with the spectral break at @xmath14kev . for the third observation",
    ", we find the ratio of the pinto xis1 normalization constant to range from 1.101.17 .",
    "this is to be compared to the 1.161.18 value found for fits to the first observation , the 1.061.08 found for the second observation , and the 1.101.11 found for the fourth observation .",
    "the expected value for the pin / xis0 comparison is 1.16 .",
    "there is some amount of scatter for the cross - normalization values among the different observations ; however , the first , second , and fourth observations show little scatter in its value for different fits to the same data .",
    "more scatter is seen for the third observation ; therefore , additional systematic uncertainties need to be considered as being present for that set of observations .    using simple broken powerlaw and",
    "exponentially cutoff powerlaw fits , we find that these spectra are among the hardest seen in the `` low hard state '' of cyg  x-1over the past decade .",
    "for all four observations , the spectra are clearly detected out to 300kev with the gso , and exponential cutoffs are well constrained .",
    "* although these are among the hardest cyg  x-1spectra ever detected , the exponential folding energies vary by over a factor 1.5 , and range from 160250kev .    historically observed hard state spectra in cyg  x-1have shown folding energies that vary over a slightly wider range , while hard state bhc as a class show folding energies that span a factor of 5 .",
    "as these spectra are among the faintest and hardest for cyg  x-1 , they make excellent test beds for theoretical models that posit , for instance , that the hard state represents a configuration with an inner disk that has evaporated into a quasi - spherical corona . in such a scenario",
    ", we might expect these spectra to show the most `` extreme '' recession of the inner disk , although we have noted that the bolometric luminosities represented by these spectra only span a factor of two .",
    "at a few percent of the eddington luminosity , they are not far below the expected soft - to - hard state transition .",
    "numerous transient bhc sources show much fainter hard states as they fade into quiescence .    we have presented a number of different spectral models , all of which describe the 0.8300kev spectra well .",
    "some of these models describe the x - ray spectra primarily with comptonization components ( whether due to a thermal or hybrid thermal / non - thermal corona ) , while the jet model is dominated by synchrotron and ssc emission from the jet .",
    "all of these models have a number of features in common .",
    "* all models require a soft excess that here we describe with a disk component with low ( @xmath144ev ) peak temperature .",
    "the implied inner radii of these disks range from 240@xmath0 . *",
    "all models require a relativistically broadened line component .",
    "the inner emission radius of this broadened line never exceeds @xmath145 , but for some models is as low as 6@xmath0 .",
    "* all models require a reflection component .",
    "the typical values for the reflection fraction are @xmath1080.3 . *",
    "all models imply that the spectral hardening at @xmath146kev is not _",
    "solely _ due to reflection .",
    "this latter point is very important , and broadly agrees with similar conclusions drawn by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the presence of the broad fe line and _ some _ of the spectral curvature in the 20300kev band is a clear indication of the presence of reflection .",
    "however , this reflection spectrum is _ not _ sitting on top of a simple `` ` disk+powerlaw ` '' spectrum .",
    "there is additional continuum complexity separate from reflection that contributes to this perceived break .",
    "a high seed photon temperature in the thermal corona model yields a soft excess in the 2 - 10kev band and thus contributes to the measured break in that scenario .",
    "( see the discussion in @xcite . )",
    "as has been discussed by @xcite , a non - thermal electron population in the corona can lead to a soft excess in the 210kev band that helps contribute to what otherwise would be modeled as a reflection break at 10kev .",
    "the two corona model discussed by @xcite , a version of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deqpair ] , rather explicitly replaces part of the reflection component with a broad band continuum model .",
    "finally , in the jet paradigm the spectral break at 10kev is partly attributable to the transition from dominance by synchrotron emission to ssc emission in the continuum .",
    "there are plausible physical scenarios for each of the discussed spectral models , with some hypothesized geometries being shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the hybrid thermal / non - thermal coronal model is the closest to the concept of the quasi - spherical inner corona with outer geometrically thin disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "we have only been able to find such solutions , however , when invoking a partly non - thermal electron population in the corona .",
    "the purely thermal coronal model contains two disk components that are reminiscent of the physical description given by @xcite .",
    "these authors describe a situation where an outer , geometrically thin , cool disk surrounds an inner , geometrically thick , hot corona . in the very inner radii of this corona",
    ", however , thermal conduction leads to it condensing into a geometrically thin and optically thick disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "such a component could supply the high temperature seed photons in our thermal corona solutions , while the lower temperature outer disk could provide the bulk of the reflection features .",
    "the jet model has a natural physical interpretation in that the usually observed optically thick radio spectrum observed in the hard state is clear indication of the presence of a jet .",
    "the question that remains is the contribution of this component to the x - ray band .",
    "the fact that the continuum is more complex than a simple `` ` disk+powerlaw ` '' , yet there are multiple , physically motivated models that yield comparably good spectral fits , leads to the final point .",
    "* although a relativistically broadened line is required in all of our spectral models , the parameters of this line are dependent upon the presumed continuum model .    coupled with this dependence upon assumed continuum spectrum is an implicit dependence upon ionized absorption , for which we have detailed _",
    "chandra_-hetgmeasurements for only the fourth observation .",
    "again , we have not found an inner radius for this line that exceeds @xmath145 .",
    "given the variations of this line with presumed continuum , however , we are as of yet unable to use this line for more refined diagnostics such as estimates of black hole spin .",
    "although we are unable as of yet to draw firm conclusions as to the best geometry and physical mechanisms to describe the hard state spectra of cyg  x-1 , these new joint _",
    "suzaku_-_rxte_data provide a stunning contrast to our prior results using solely _",
    "rxte_data @xcite .",
    "for the _ rxte_data alone we were able to describe the 3125kev spectra with a variety of physically motivated comptonization models and to describe correlations among the fit parameters .",
    "on the other hand , the simple exponentially cutoff , broken powerlaw models with a single , broad gaussian line described the data equally well , if not better @xcite . when considering the 0.8300kev _",
    "suzaku_-_rxte_data discussed here , this is no longer the case .",
    "we now require complex absorption at low energy , an asymmetric broad line plus narrow emission and absorption components in the fe line region , and a complex continuum model . the catalog of _ suzaku_observations of bhc will continue to increase such that we observe a wider variety of bhc states and luminosities .",
    "furthermore the sophistication and physical self - consistency of the spectral models will continue to improve .",

    "we have created two tools to aid our _ suzaku_data analysis : aeattcor.sl and ` pile_estimate.sl ` .",
    "the tools , descriptions of their use , and example results can be found at : http://space.mit.edu/asc/software/suzaku .",
    "the former tool further corrects the _",
    "suzaku_attitude solution , whereas the latter estimates the degree of pileup in a given subset of the observation .",
    "both are scripts written in ` s - lang ` but are designed to be run on a terminal command line using ` isis ` , the interactive spectral analysis system @xcite , as a driver . for all intents and purposes ,",
    "the scripts behave similar to the typical unix command line tools found in the ` heasoft ` package .",
    "thermal flexing of the _ suzaku_spacecraft leads to a slow wobbling of the optical axis , and hence blurring of the image .",
    "suzaku_tools partially correct this effect by adjusting the spacecraft attitude file based upon details of the spacecraft orbit , temperature , etc . @xcite . `",
    "aeattcor.sl ` further improves this correction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correction ] ) for a bright source by using its time - dependent detected image to create a new attitude file . specifically , the tool attempts to shift the time - dependent mean detector image position to a new specified , fixed sky position .",
    "it presumes that there are no intrinsic variations in the time - dependent image position .",
    "( a mean image position may be time varying , for example , if it is comprised of two or more variable sources of comparable flux .",
    "additionally , a highly variable and piled up source where an `` image crater '' appears and disappears over the course of the observation may lead to a variable mean image position . )",
    "the bin time over which the tool searches for and shifts the image peak is a user selectable parameter ; however , we have used the default of 100 seconds .",
    "we applied the tool to detector images that first underwent the standard attitude correction process @xcite .",
    "we chose circular regions with radius @xmath17 that were visually centered on the source image .",
    "the tool then created a new attitude correction file , which we applied with the ` xiscoord ` tool .",
    "all of our attitude correction files were created using solely the xis1 images .",
    "pileup occurs in ccd detectors when two or more photons fall on the same or neighboring pixels during the same readout frame , and therefore are read as a single higher energy photon or are discarded as a bad event @xcite . `",
    "pile_estimate.sl ` was run after ` aeattcor.sl ` , as uncorrected blurring leads to an _ underestimate _ of the degree of pileup .",
    "the tool first creates a lightcurve in three energy bands , using both rate and counts .",
    "here we used the default values of 0.51.5kev , 1.53kev , and 39kev for the energy bands and 32 seconds for the time bins .",
    "these data are then passed to the ` vwhere ` @xcite filtering tool .",
    "the ` vwhere ` tool was used to create the color - intensity diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] ) , and it was used to select times of approximately uniform rates and colors ( see  [ sec : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "these time selections were then written to a filter file used for subsequent data extraction using the ` xselect ` tool .",
    "a box - car smoothed ( 3@xmath1473 pixel bins ) image is displayed using the ` ds9 ` tool , with the image rescaled to the estimated pile up fraction .",
    "pile up fraction here is defined to be the ratio of events lost via grade or energy migration to the events expected in the absence of pileup .",
    "furthermore , the pile up fraction is based upon the mean counts per 3@xmath1473 pixel region per readout frame .",
    "the image displays discrete steps that represent the minimum pileup fraction in the displayed region , with the exception of the highest displayed value .",
    "this value corresponds to the image maximum , and is shown over regions at this maximum down to half way towards the next lowest displayed value .    using this image",
    ", we chose to exclude the central regions with pile up fractions @xmath148 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : correction ] ) .",
    "typically , this was an @xmath16 radius region , comprising @xmath149 of the detected events .",
    "the ` pile_estimate.sl ` tool then gives an estimate of the mean level of the remaining pile up fraction in the image , which for these data was typically @xmath18 ."

    "<S> using _ suzaku_and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , we have conducted a series of four simultaneous observations of the galactic black hole candidate cyg  x-1 in what were historically faint and spectrally hard `` low states '' . additionally , all of these observations occurred near superior conjunction with our line of sight to the x - ray source passing through the dense phases of the `` focused wind '' from the mass donating secondary . </S>",
    "<S> one of our observations was also simultaneous with observations by the _ chandra_-high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) . </S>",
    "<S> these latter spectra are crucial for revealing the ionized absorption due to the secondary s focused wind . </S>",
    "<S> such absorption is present and must be accounted for in all four spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these simultaneous data give an unprecedented view of the 0.8300kev spectrum of cyg  x-1 , and hence bear upon both corona and x - ray emitting jet models of black hole hard states . </S>",
    "<S> three models fit the spectra well : coronae with thermal or mixed thermal / non - thermal electron populations , and jets . </S>",
    "<S> all three models require a soft component that we fit with a low temperature disk spectrum with an inner radius of only a few tens of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> all three models also agree that the known spectral break at 10kev is not solely due to the presence of reflection , but each gives a different underlying explanation for the augmentation of this break . </S>",
    "<S> thus whereas all three models require that there is a relativistically broadened fe line , the strength and inner radius of such a line is dependent upon the specific model , thus making premature line - based estimates of the black hole spin in the cyg x-1 system . </S>",
    "<S> we look at the relativistic line in detail , accounting for the narrow fe emission and ionized absorption detected by hetg . </S>",
    "<S> although the specific relativistic parameters of the line are continuum - dependent , none of the broad line fits allow for an inner disk radius that is @xmath1@xmath0 . </S>"
