    "the ability to controllably engineer spin splittings of electronic states is a key goal in the search for spintronic materials  @xcite .",

    "the ability to electrostatically control the strength of such spin splitting  @xcite has led to prospects for all - electrical manipulation of electron spin precession  @xcite , offering new prototypical schemes of semiconductor spintronics  @xcite .",
    "the quest to practically realise such devices , and to operate them without cryogenic cooling , has motivated a major search for materials which can host stronger spin splittings than can typically be achieved in conventional semiconductors  @xcite .    a giant rashba - like spin splitting",
    "was recently discovered for bulk conduction and valence band states of the bismuth tellurohalide semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "arising due to a combination of bulk inversion asymmetry ( fig .",
    "[ f : overview](b ) ) , strong atomic spin - orbit coupling , and a negative crystal field splitting of the valence bands  @xcite , rashba parameters amongst the highest of any known material have been uncovered , together with a counter - rotating chiral fermi surface spin texture  @xcite . exploiting element- and orbital - selective angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , we show here that a complex interplay between atomic , orbital , and spin degrees of freedom significantly enriches this picture .",
    "we expect our findings to be broadly applicable across other strong spin - orbit rashba systems .",
    "* surface electronic structure of bitei . * ( a ) arpes measurements of the fermi surface and near-@xmath0 band dispersions measured ( @xmath1  ev , @xmath2-polarisation ) from the te - terminated surface of bitei . a lack of inversion symmetry of the bulk crystal structure ( b ) together with strong spin - orbit coupling mediates a large rashba - like spin splitting .",
    "additionally , the polar nature of the te - terminated surface induces a strong downward band bending , causing a ladder of rashba - split subband ( sb ) states to emerge in the near - surface quantum well .",
    "( c ) these are clearly resolved in measurements of the dispersion along @xmath3 . the conventional spin texture associated with such rashba splitting",
    "is shown schematically by coloured arrows , with the spin expected to lie predominantly in the surface plane . ]    first , we summarise the generic electronic structure of the te - terminated surface of bitei ( fig .  [ f : overview ] ) .",
    "previous measurements have shown this termination to support a near - surface electron accumulation  @xcite .",
    "we clearly observe two 2d subbands ( sb1 and sb2 in fig .",
    "[ f : overview](c ) , see also supplementary fig .",
    "s1 ) formed within the resulting quantum well .",
    "each subband hosts two branches with a separation that grows approximately linearly with momentum away from their crossing at @xmath4 .",
    "this is a hallmark of rashba - like spin splitting .",
    "we extract a large rashba energy @xmath5  mev ( @xmath6  mev ) and momentum offset of the band bottom @xmath7  @xmath8 ( @xmath9  @xmath8 ) for the first ( second ) subband , respectively , supporting previous studies which established this material as a model host of giant spin splittings  @xcite .",
    "while typically treated in a single - band picture , the electronic wavefunction for each branch of a rashba - split state can more generally be written as @xmath10 , where , following the notation in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath11 is the atomic index , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the orbital and spin indices , respectively , @xmath14 are atomic wavefunctions , and @xmath15 are complex coefficients . neglecting spin - orbit coupling , our calculations predict a conduction band in bitei predominantly derived from bi  @xmath16 orbitals ( see supplementary fig .",
    "including such effects , however , not only permits it to become strongly spin - split via rashba - like interactions , but also promotes significant orbital mixing . in general , therefore , multiple @xmath15 can be expected to become non - negligible . for a complete description of the rashba - split states ,",
    "it is therefore essential to consider the interplay of the underlying atomic , orbital , and spin components . to disentangle these ,",
    "we combine two powerful features of arpes : characteristic selection rules for photoemission using linearly - polarised light , allowing us to directly probe the orbital wavefunction  @xcite , and resonant photoemission to provide elemental sensitivity  @xcite . such resonant enhancements are evident in fig .  [",

    "they cause the spectral weight of the conduction band states to become strongly peaked at photon energies around 26 and 28  ev , close in energy to the binding energy of the bi  @xmath17 core levels , with functional forms that are well described by fano lineshapes .",
    "this points to a significant bi - derived atomic character of the lowest conduction band states , consistent with theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "we exploit this , selectively probing `` on - resonance '' to unveil the bi - projected spectral function .",
    "the resulting measurements of the dispersion reveal pronounced momentum - dependent spectral weight variations ( fig .",
    "[ f : disp](c ) ) .",
    "we focus on the first subband ( sb1 ) , which is most clearly visible across our measurements . when probed using @xmath2-polarised light , we find stronger spectral weight for the inner branch of this subband , while the outer branch is significantly more pronounced when measured using @xmath18-polarisation .",
    "selection rules  @xcite dictate that , of the @xmath2-orbitals , the former measurement should be sensitive to @xmath16- and @xmath19-derived orbital character , while the transition matrix element is only non - vanishing for photoemission from @xmath20 orbitals in the latter case ( our measurement geometry is shown in fig .

    "the asymmetric spectral weight distributions within and between these measurements immediately establishes that the two spin - split branches of the dispersion host a markedly different orbital makeup .",

    "the in - plane bi - projected charge density must therefore be oriented such that its lobes point predominantly radially outwards from the outer ces .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for the inner band of the ces at energies below the dirac point formed by the crossing of the two spin - split branches of the dispersion .",

    "[ f : cec](b , c ) , and more clearly shown in the angular dependence of spectral weight extracted around the ces in fig .  [ f : orb](a ) , the spectral weight is still peaked along the @xmath25 direction ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig .  [",

    "moving up through the dirac point , however , the angular distribution of spectral weight around the inner ces gradually flattens and then inverts to become peaked at @xmath30 .",
    "this points to a tangential alignment of the in - plane bi - derived orbital character above the dirac point , with stronger @xmath20 character at positive and negative @xmath26 than positive and negative @xmath25 .",

    "[ f : orb](c ) , the in - plane @xmath31 orbital polarisation around the calculated cess of the lower subband show a clear peak at @xmath30 above the dirac point , and 0 and @xmath28 below . to capture this generic behaviour",

    "this provides an experimental measure of the calculated `` orbital polarisation ratio '' used to describe topological states in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , this parameterises the relative strength of spectral weight , and thus @xmath20 orbital character , along the @xmath26 and @xmath25 directions of our measured cess , reflecting the strength ( @xmath36 ) and alignment of radial ( @xmath37 ) and tangential ( @xmath38 ) in - plane orbital textures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : orb](b ) , we find this is positive at energies above the dirac point for the on - resonance measurements , consistent with the dominantly tangential in - plane bi - projected charge density distribution of the inner band assigned above . with decreasing energy towards the dirac point ,",
    "@xmath39 is suppressed to zero , indicating a loss of orbital polarisation , before growing again but with opposite sign below the dirac point .",
    "thus , we have experimentally observed a gradual crossover from a radial to a tangential alignment of the in - plane bi orbital character with the switch occurring exactly at the dirac point within our experimental error .",
    "this is strikingly similar to a switch in orbital texture that was recently reported at the dirac point of the spin - polarised surface states of topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "our observation of such a crossover in a topologically - trivial compound establishes this as a general feature of strongly spin - orbit coupled systems , a point we return to below .",
    "intriguingly , extracting @xmath40 from our measurements performed off - resonance , we find an opposite trend ( fig .",
    "[ f : orb](b ) ) . above the dirac point , @xmath37 indicating a radial alignment of the in - plane orbital - projected charge density , as also clearly evident in the spectral weight distribution visible in fig .",
    "[ f : cec](d ) .",
    "this is again smoothly suppressed to zero approaching the dirac point before becoming positive , revealing a tangential orbital configuration , at energies below dirac point .",
    "we attribute this as a signature of the in - plane te orbital polarisation , which well matches that found in our calculations ( fig .",
    "[ f : orb](d ) ) .",
    "it can be seen in our measurements here at 30  ev photon energy as , with no bi resonant enhancement , the photoemission cross - section is higher for te  @xmath41 than bi  @xmath42 orbitals  @xcite and , with te being located right at the surface , there is no depth - dependent attenuation due to the surface sensitivity of photoemission .",
    "our calculations ( supplementary fig",
    ".  s2 ) reveal a strong in - plane te character of the inner branch of the dispersion , which can thus dominate the spectral weight of the inner branch of the ces in these off - resonance measurements . for the outer branch , however , there is little calculated in - plane te weight ( supplemental fig .",
    "s2 ) , and so the weak spectral features visible for the outer branch in fig .",
    "[ f : cec](d ) is still reflective of the bi in - plane orbital texture .",
    "together , these measurements and calculations reveal that spin - orbit coupling induces a complex atomic- and momentum - dependent hierarchy of orbitally - polarised components of the underlying electronic structure in bitei , summarised schematically in fig .",
    "[ f : cd ] .",
    "our calculations additionally reveal how each orbital component is , in turn , coupled to a disparate spin texture .",
    "we illustrate this for the bi - derived states in fig .",
    "[ f : cd](b - d ) ; the te - derived component is additionally shown in supplementary fig .",
    "the in - plane spin - texture @xmath43 projected onto bi @xmath16 orbitals yields a conventional counter - rotating chiral spin texture of neighbouring cess at energies above the dirac point , characteristic of classic rashba systems  @xcite and indeed observed experimentally for bitei  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the spin texture is significantly more complex for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbital projection , with the in - plane spin component switching between tangential and radial around the ces .",
    "this results from a coupling of the spin to the characteristic orbital textures , and is similar to that found recently for topological surface states  @xcite .",
    "for example , combined with our uncovered tangential ( radial ) in - plane bi orbital texture above ( below ) the dp , this leads to a net clockwise spin rotation for the in - plane orbital projection of _ both _ the inner and outer cess .",
    "this is in strong departure from the conventional picture of rashba - like spin polarisation .",
    "such in - plane orbital textures likely also underlie the unconventional spin topology predicted for certain @xmath44-derived states in bi / cu(111 )  @xcite and pb / cu(111 )  @xcite surface alloys .",
    "they are also broadly consistent with recent first - principles calculations that suggest the rashba parameter can be orbital - dependent in bismuth tellurohalides  @xcite , although here we reveal how orbital mixing can lock the spin components on the nominally `` spin - split '' cess together , stabilising pronounced components of the underlying wavefunction that host markedly non - rashba - like spin textures in this system .",
    "similar considerations hold for the te - derived components , although with additional variations in the magnitude of the spin components projected onto out - of - plane vs. in - plane orbital components between the cess due to a greater out vs. in - plane orbital polarisation for te ( supplementary figs .",
    "s2 and s3 ) . with each orbital component",
    "locked to a different spin texture , the fundamental requirement from time - reversal symmetry of spin - degeneracy at the kramer s point ( the dirac point formed in this system at @xmath4 ) ensures equal contribution of in - plane @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals at this point .",
    "thus , the vanishing of orbital polarisation at the dirac point observed experimentally above can be simply viewed as an orbital analogue of kramer s spin degeneracy in time - reversal symmetric systems .",
    "away from the dirac point , our calculations additionally predict a strong canting of the spin out of the surface plane for the bi - derived orbitals .",
    "this grows in magnitude with increasing energy away from the dirac point , where the cess become increasingly hexagonally warped  @xcite .",
    "we show evidence for this through circular dichroism measurements .",
    "we attribute such dichroism as a signature of unquenched orbital angular momentum  @xcite , which our calculations reveal is large and locked approximately opposite to the spin angular momentum due to the strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "circular dichroism is known to show a complex dependence on photon energy in this system  @xcite as well as in other layered compounds such as bi@xmath45te@xmath46 ( ref .  ) , which can naturally arise as a consequence of inter - layer photoelectron interference  @xcite . to simplify such effects",
    ", we again perform our measurements on - resonance , selectively enhancing states of bi character ( fig .",
    "[ f : cd](f ) ) .",
    "we find that the outer ( hexagonally - warped ) band in such measurements develops a pronounced six - fold modulation , which has previously been shown to reflect out - of - plane spin - canting in topological insulators  @xcite . here",
    ", this provides the first experimental evidence for deviations from simple in - plane chiral spin textures in bitei .        as evident in fig .",
    "[ f : cd](b - d ) , @xmath47 is substantially larger when projected onto the in - plane orbital components than for the @xmath16 projection .",
    "the emergence of a large out - of - plane spin canting in this system is thus intricately tied to the development of the in - plane orbital texture away from the dirac point observed here .",
    "together , our measurements and calculations establish a powerful role of in - plane atomic orbitals shaping the spin structure of the model rashba compound bitei , revealing a complex interplay between atomic makeup , anisotropic orbital textures , and spin - momentum locking . while small quantitative variations may occur due to near - surface potential contributions to the rashba spin splitting and possible surface - induced orbital reconstructions here",
    ", our findings should be broadly applicable to the spin - split bulk electronic structure of bitei as well as being generic to other strong spin - orbit rashba systems , suggesting new routes to control spin splitting through the orbital sector .",
    "for example , exploiting structure - property relations to tune the competition of atomic spin - orbit coupling and crystal field splitting will allow control over the ratio of in - plane and out - of - plane orbital polarisation , thus modulating the degree of non - rashba - like spin components and out - of - plane spin canting . together , this promises new prospects for the targeted design of optimised spintronic materials .",

    "<S> the rashba effect is one of the most striking manifestations of spin - orbit coupling in solids , and provides a cornerstone for the burgeoning field of semiconductor spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> it is typically assumed to manifest as a momentum - dependent splitting of a single initially spin - degenerate band into two branches with opposite spin polarisation . here , </S>",
    "<S> combining polarisation - dependent and resonant angle - resolved photoemission measurements with density - functional theory calculations , we show that the two `` spin - split '' branches of the model giant rashba system bitei additionally develop disparate orbital textures , each of which is coupled to a distinct spin configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this necessitates a re - interpretation of spin splitting in rashba - like systems , and opens new possibilities for controlling spin polarisation through the orbital sector . </S>"
