    "radio - over - fiber is a very attractive technique for wireless access network infrastructure , because it can transmit microwaves and millimeter - waves through optical fibers for a long distance .",
    "therefore , the distribution of radio signals over optical fiber , which is of great interest for many applications such as broad - band wireless access networks , sensor networks , radar and satellite communications , has been intensively studied .",
    "and there have been rapid advances in the techniques to generate and transport radio signals over optical fiber in recent years ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . when the wireless channel is in series with the optical link ,",
    "nonlinear distortion due to the electrical / optical conversion is the biggest concern ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this makes nonlinearity compensation an attractive solution to improve link performance .",
    "the focus of this work is to investigate the standard physical model used for describing commercial laser diodes .",
    "this model is based on rate equation for the electron and photon populations .",
    "this allows us to propose a pre - compensation based on differential flatness for the design of the input current in order to cancel diode distortions .",
    "simulations corresponding to a commercial laser diode illustrate the pre - compensation scheme .",
    "when the distortion due to the optic fiber is negligible , our flatness - based pre - compensation scheme can be interesting to increase the bandwidth and transmission rate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "flat : sec ] we recall the standard diode model and show that it is structurally flat , with the photon number being the flat output @xmath0 . we show via elementary computations that the input current is a linear combination of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 with coefficients depending via explicit formula on the physical parameters ( equation  ) .",
    "this relation is the starting point of the flatness based pre - compensation scheme addressed in section  [ precomp : sec ] . in section  [ approx : sec ] , we propose natural approximations when @xmath0 is quasi - harmonic with slowly varying amplitude and phase .",
    "these approximations simplify considerably the computation burden in such a way that a nonlinear analogue circuit can be easily design to realize our flatness - based pre - compensation scheme . in conclusion , we propose some hint to deal with phase influence that becomes important when fiber distortions can not be negligible .",
    "a standard nonlinear model relating the input - current @xmath5 to the power of the emitted light @xmath6 is recalled in @xcite where this model is used to analyze the nonlinear `` transfer '' between input - current modulation @xmath5 and the resulting output @xmath6 ) ( see also @xcite for a simple exposure on such basic models ) : @xmath7 where    * @xmath8 and @xmath9 are photon and carrier lifetimes ; * @xmath10 is the normalized carrier density ; * @xmath11 is the threshold current and @xmath12 is the constant related to other physical parameters , @xmath13 .",
    "* @xmath14 is the net rate of stimulated emission .",
    "following  @xcite we use @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath9,@xmath17 are physical parameters .",
    "since the input - current appears only in the second differential equation of   ( the electron balance equation ) , the first state , @xmath6 , is a flat output .",
    "more precisely , this means that , if we consider   as a control system with input @xmath5 and output @xmath18 , we have a nonlinear input / output system such that its inverse admits no dynamics .",
    "this system is differentially flat ( see  @xcite ) with @xmath6 as flat output : the input @xmath5 is a nonlinear function of @xmath6 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "notice that this property is independent of the precise form of @xmath14 when it depends effectively on @xmath10 .",
    "this is always the case for physical reasons .",
    "let us detail now the computations with the precise form of @xmath21 given here above .",
    "the first equation of   yields @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constant parameters .",
    "thus we can derive this expression versus @xmath25 to get @xmath26 as a function of @xmath6 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath27 a linear combination of the two equations of   gives @xmath5 explicitly : @xmath28 thus we have the explicit formula relating @xmath5 to the derivatives of @xmath6 : @xmath29 with the normalized input / ouput variables @xmath30 we have the following simple but nonlinear input / output relationships that is equivalent to the physical model  : @xmath31 where the four parameters @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath17 and @xmath32 are positive time - scales .",
    "remember that the normalized electron density @xmath10 is a combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath33",
    "we can now use   for deriving feed - forward strategy in order to compensate the non - linear distortion due to the diode .",
    "assume that our goal is to transfer the amplitude and phase modulated signal @xmath34 from the current to the light leaving the diode .",
    "here @xmath35 is the carriage pulsation , typically around a few ghz for radio frequencies , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are slowly varying amplitude and phase where the bits are encoded .",
    "this means that @xmath38 and @xmath39 . without",
    "lost a generality , we can assume that @xmath40 .",
    "assume finally that this modulated signal has to be converted in photons @xmath41 according to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is some positive constant .",
    "this means that our goal is to find the current @xmath44 leading to such @xmath0 . if one knows the diode parameters we can use   to compute @xmath44 .",
    "we have tested in simulation this simple pre - compensation scheme for the commercial diode considered in  @xcite . for this diode ,",
    "we have @xmath45 we choose a modulation frequency @xmath35 of @xmath46  ghz ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the average normalized light power is @xmath50 corresponds physically to @xmath51  mw since @xmath52  mw . the simulations of figure  [ fig1 ] illustrate the interest of taking into account the derivative terms in   to modulate the input current @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath53{mod.eps}\\ ] ]",
    "for such high carrier frequency @xmath54  ghz , it is difficult and almost impossible to use real - time numerical computations .",
    "let us now propose two approximations such that the above pre - compensation scheme can be applied in real - time via a specific electronic circuit .",
    "the first approximation is relative to the computation of derivative of @xmath0 .",
    "since we are looking for @xmath44 such that @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 slowly varying quantities , we have @xmath58 the second approximation is relative to the nonlinearity attached to the @xmath59-terms in  .",
    "now we will use @xmath60 and propose an approximation up to second order terms : @xmath61 plugging these approximations into   shows that @xmath44 can be expressed approximatively as a polynomial of degree @xmath62 in @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "such polynomial computations can be easily done by a nonlinear analogue circuit .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that the diode response remains almost the same when such polynomial approximations are used .",
    "other simulations displayed on figure  [ fig3 ] show that such pre - compensation scheme are also robust to parameters uncertainties .",
    "@xmath53{modrobust.eps}\\ ] ]    @xmath53{modrobustbis.eps}\\ ] ]",
    "we have shown that it is possible to compute , via flatness - based motion planing techniques , adapted input current modulations in order to generate , in real - time and via analogue nonlinear circuits , a given modulation of the light entering the optic fiber .",
    "if the distortion along the fiber is not negligible ( long fiber and/or refractive index strongly dependent versus optic frequency ) , we have to consider also the phase dynamic of the light emitted by the diode ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for more details about the spectrum widening due to phase / amplitude variations ) .",
    "following  @xcite we have to complete   by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the phase of the emitted light and @xmath67 a positive constant .",
    "thus the emitted light entering the optic fiber is represented by the classical electric field ( complex notations ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the optical frequency ( around @xmath70  hz ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the diode dynamics ( described by three states @xmath71 ) and one input @xmath5 ) is still flat with @xmath72 being the new flat output .",
