    "during the last few years we have witnessed a wealth of work on the application of methods of statistical physics to the study of economic problems configuring what some authors called _ econophysics _ @xcite . within this framework",
    "a great deal of effort was dedicated to the analysis of economic data ranging from stock exchange fluctuations @xcite , production models , size distribution of companies , the appearance of money , effects of control on the market to market critical properties @xcite .",
    "another problem that attracted enormous interest was the origin of power ( paretto ) laws , and lognormal distribution with power law tails , for the income of individuals , wealth distribution , debt of bankrupt companies @xcite .",
    "an interesting source of several mathematical descriptions and models used in economical and sociological contexts can be found in @xcite .    here , our interest is the study , in a deterministic way , of aspects of the competition and coexistence of agents or companies in a common market .",
    "we present a simple  toy \" model describing , in analogy to some ecological problems , a situation of competition among several companies . within a  malthusian - like \" model we analyze the effect of a kind of _ intracompetitive _ contribution on the possibility of companies coexistence in a certain market , and the changing leadership role ( measure through some wealth parameter ) between , according to the standard ecological definition ,  strong \" and  weak \" companies .    according to ecological studies , starting with volterra s first results on the mathematical theory of competition @xcite ,",
    "the problem of competition and coexistence between species has been analyzed and resumed within the _ competitive exclusion principle _ ( or _ ecological theorem _ ) , that states : _",
    "@xmath0 species that compete for @xmath1 food resources , can not coexist _",
    "several aspects of this problem have been analyzed by different authors , emphasizing , for instance , the conflict between the need to forage and the need to avoid competition ; effects of diffusion - mediated persistence .",
    "generally , the system describing competition between species can be represented by a set of @xmath0 differential equations for the species and @xmath2 for the resources . as an example , with only one food resource we find only two stable stationary solutions : the trivial one ( extinction of all he species ) , and that corresponding to the survival of only one species , the  strongest \" one .",
    "there are also studies of the problem related to the possibility of coexistence in the form of wave  like solutions @xcite .    here",
    "we adapt the model used in refs.@xcite for the case of a homogeneous competitive market with a unique wealth resource and several firms . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and some particular , instructive , solutions . due to the difficulties of finding analytical solutions for the general case , in section iii we focus on a representative system with a small number ( here 4 ) of firms , and analyze its behavior by numerical methods . in the last section",
    "we draw some conclusions .",
    "we start describing the model we use , which is related to the one used in refs.@xcite for the study of coexistence in an ecological framework in the form of wave  like solutions .",
    "such a model has been adapted to the problem of competition of @xmath0 agents or companies for a unique common wealth resource .",
    "we indicate with @xmath3 the  size \" or wealth - parameter representing the welfare of the @xmath4-company ( @xmath5 ) and with @xmath6 the total amount of  wealth \" .",
    "the set of differential equations that we use to describe the behavior ( for the homogeneous case ) of such a complex system includes a ",
    "malthusian - like \" birth - death equation @xcite for each company ( @xmath7 corresponding to benefits coming from the wealth s share and @xmath8 for the  standard \" losses  or costs of the @xmath4-th company ) .",
    "we also include a contribution that corresponds , in ecological language , to taking into account the existence of some kind of _ intracompetition _ , that is * if * the @xmath4-th the company is alone and can get all the wealth @xmath6 , it can only grow up to a maximum bounded size , a behavior that can be modelled by a verhulst - like term @xcite .",
    "this takes into account the in ecological contexts so called _ carrying capacity _ of the economic environment @xcite . in economic terms",
    "it could correspond to an increase of the company efficiency , for instance , through the reduction of operative internal costs , improved management , avoiding of competition between different branches of the same firm , instrumentation of new technologies , etc .",
    "in addition , instead of assuming a constant finite wealth resource as in the so called  total wealth conserved model \" @xcite , we consider that @xmath6 has its own dynamics . for the equation for @xmath6 , the economic wealth accessible to the companies that , in order to simplify this initial analysis we assume is unique , we also consider a  malthusian - like \" behavior including : its production ( new resources and technologies , harvest and grain production , etc ) that we assume has a constant rate @xmath9 , and its disappearance due to : ( a ) natural degradation or rotting of crops , technologies becoming old , some resources being exhausted , that we assume has a rate proportional to the total wealth amount @xmath10 ( only a certain portion of @xmath6 disappears ) , ( b ) the share of each company given by @xmath11 .    the set of equations is ( @xmath5 ) @xmath12\\ , n_j(t ) - \\gamma _ j \\frac{n_j^2}{m } \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt }   m(t)&=&q(t ) - [ g+ \\sum \\beta _ k\\,n_k(t)]\\ , m(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly to what was discussed in @xcite for the case of only two species , we can here define a hierarchy from the  strongest \" ( largest ratio between wealth share and standard losses , i.e. largest @xmath13 ) to the  weakest \" ( smallest ratio ) companies .",
    "assuming the following hierarchical order @xmath14 we have that @xmath15 is the strongest company while @xmath16 is the weakest one .",
    "it is worth noting in passing that eqs.([sis0 ] ) resembles the form of multimode laser systems @xcite , making it possible to transfer some results from one system to the other .",
    "the stationary solutions results from taking @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we found @xmath19 - \\gamma _ j \\frac{n_j^s}{m_s } \\right ) \\ , n_j^s.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation implies one of two possibilities @xmath20\\,m_s}{\\gamma _ j } .\\ ] ]    it is clear that for large @xmath0 , to find the solution of this system is not easy . in order to fix ideas we consider the simplified case where , instead of the above indicated hierarchy , we have that all companies are equivalent , that is @xmath21 implying @xmath22 in this case we have @xmath23\\ , q^2}{\\gamma ( g + n \\beta n_s)^2},\\ ] ] that can be rewritten as @xmath24 it is possible to find under which conditions at least one solution of eq .",
    "( [ stat4 ] ) is real .",
    "however , it is more instructive to look for the behavior at small @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) as all the coefficients of @xmath27 with @xmath28 are negative .",
    "hence , we can easily obtain that a solution , given by @xmath29 exists ( is positive ) if @xmath30 in this case , as one of the associated eigenvalues is zero , a linear stability analysis does not give a clear information about the stability of the solution and it is necessary to resort to a more refined analysis .",
    "another instructive case is to consider @xmath31 here we reduce to essentially the same situation studied in @xcite . in particular , it is coincident with the situation studied in @xcite , but now having an  effective \" weak species given by @xmath32 , @xmath33 . as in @xcite , and as discussed in detail latter for the case of several firms , it is possible to find a coexistence region when @xmath34 overcomes some threshold value .",
    "in this case a linear stability analysis shows a change in the stability of these solutions .    as a general analytical study of our system even for @xmath0",
    "not too large is far beyond our interest , in the next section we focus on a numerical approach for a case with a small , however representative , value of @xmath0 analyzing some relevant situations .",
    "as indicated before , here we focus in a case with @xmath0 small ( in fact @xmath35 ) that shows all the relevant aspects we can expect in the large @xmath0 situation . defining the ratio @xmath36 we consider several situations : + a ) when the different companies are in hierarchical order , that is @xmath37 ; + b ) when we have @xmath38 ; + c ) when @xmath39 .    among all the possible scenarios",
    "we have chosen those showing regions of coexistence of all the species , thus in case ( a ) we investigate the situation with fixed @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and varying @xmath34 .",
    "that allows us to have a control parameter , but we recall that the choice is arbitrary . in this case",
    "the usual strong and weak concepts make us consider the species 1 as the strongest and the 4 as the weakest . with the inclusion of the new term",
    "we find not only the possibility of coexistence but also that the original hierarchical order can be permuted several times as the parameter values are varied .",
    "thus , we find that the ranking of companies suffers many changes , with companies interchanging roles several times . some examples of this case are shown in fig.1 . besides these new features we observe the classical extinction of companies as predicted by the exclusion theorem . in all the cases the extinction occurs by one species at a time .",
    "figure 1 shows two typical results for the stationary values reached by @xmath3 as function of @xmath42 .",
    "it is apparent that according to the different values , the relative status of each company can change and even reversed with several crossing among them . in this figure @xmath34",
    "varies continuously from 10 to 0 .",
    "the ratios @xmath43 are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in fig.1a",
    "we have @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , while in fig 1.b @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    for the case ( b ) above",
    ", we considered as our variable @xmath53 . in this case",
    "we have one strong species with @xmath54 , and three similar species , @xmath55 , that could coexist if there was not a strongest one .",
    "we want to note that though @xmath56 the same is not true for @xmath57 and @xmath58 values .",
    "once again , we observe coexistence between species and a reorganization of the company or agents ranking , not accordingly to the original concept of strength but depending of the values of @xmath59 .",
    "the coexistence is achieved within certain parameter region .",
    "the extinction is gradual and governed mainly by @xmath60 values .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where again we depict the stationary values of @xmath3 as functions of @xmath61 . in fig 2.a",
    "we have @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , while in fig 2.b @xmath65 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "it is apparent that the most relevant parameter when considering competition is the value of @xmath59 .",
    "when species are equally strong or weak , we observe that different stationary density levels are reached according to @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath59 is of the same order the coexistence is granted . on the contrary",
    ", a species with a high @xmath59 will not survive even if competing with similar species . as an additional feature we observe that a usual strong species @xmath4 will not survive even if competing with weaker species if @xmath66 is much higher than that of the other species .    in case ( c ) we considered two situations : a first one varying @xmath34 ; and a second varying @xmath67 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 , where again we depict the stationary values of @xmath3 as functions of @xmath42 and @xmath68 respectively . in both cases",
    "3 @xmath69 , @xmath70 , while in a ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and in b)@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we confirm that the coexistence can be achieved for proper @xmath60 values . at the same time",
    "we observe that the usual concept of strongest species can not be applied as in both previous cases , species 2 , one of the strongest if @xmath59 were zero remains as the weakest species due to a high @xmath77 value .",
    "the results shown above indicates how the study of simplified models could help in the understanding of the role played by @xmath78 , an internal company parameter , associated to the company efficiency , in situations where the complexity of the economic reality makes very hard to obtain a complete model . in our case , the model so far studied could give some hints on the behavior of systems of companies in competition and the possibility of coexistence and the way that one company can use to  eliminate \" the competing ones adopting a policy tending to adequately change its @xmath60 . here",
    "we have analyzed the effect of explicitly including the _ carrying capacity _ of the environment within our _ toy _ model for describing the coexistence of species in competition .",
    "the results put in evidence the role played by the term associated to @xmath60 in the possibility of coexistence .",
    "we recall that in the absence of such term the exclusion principle is valid and only the species ( one or more ) with the highest @xmath79 survive .",
    "it is also this term that , within certain parameter region , governs the company or agents ranking .",
    "a model written in the same terms can clearly also be applicable to ecological situations .",
    "but in this case , rather than a deterministic control of @xmath60 , some fluctuations or cyclic changes in this parameter should be considered .",
