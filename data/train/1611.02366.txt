    "q - plates are well known devices that couple spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of optical beams @xcite . due to this coupling , it is possible to exchange electromagnetic angular momentum between circular polarization modes ( spin angular momentum ) and helical wavefront modes ( orbital angular momentum ) @xcite .",
    "the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) eigenstates @xcite , such as the laguerre - gauss ( lg ) transverse modes @xcite , are characterized in the cylindrical coordinate system by the azimuthal phase factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an integer and @xmath2 the azimuthal angle .",
    "these modes have many applications including fiber mode selection @xcite , optical tweezers and micromanipulation @xcite . in the domain of quantum optics , lg beams carry an oam of @xmath3 per photon @xcite and define an infinite basis in hilbert space that can be represented , along with the spin angular momentum states , in a higher - order poincar sphere @xcite .    in order to generate an helical phase front , which carries oam",
    ", one must introduce a convenient polarization and position dependent phase shift @xmath4 on the beam cross section .",
    "usually , this task is realized in a q - plate by a thin layer of liquid crystal whose molecules have their axes oriented along a certain pattern engraved on a glass surface @xcite .",
    "for example , when a circularly polarized gaussian beam passes through a q - plate with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for linear polarization along the radial ( azimuthal ) direction , its polarization handedness is flipped and it acquires an oam of @xmath7 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] .",
    "the right value of @xmath8 is achieved by tuning the q - plate either thermally @xcite or electrially @xcite .     for linear polarization along the radial direction and @xmath9 for linear polarization along the azimuthal direction . ]",
    "although the use of a liquid - crystal allows for relatively simple fabrication techniques @xcite , its absorption spectrum may set limits to the wavelength and power ranges that can be handled by the q - plate .",
    "these possible limitations can be circumvented by exploiting the phenomenon of form birefringence to fabricate q - plates with subwavelength surface relief gratings @xcite . due to technical difficulties in fabrication ,",
    "subwavelength surface relief q - plates are in general limited to wavelengths of the order of 10@xmath10 m .    in this paper",
    "we exploit the phenomenon of form birefringence to fabricate a q - plate without the use of liquid crystals , capable of operating in a large wavelength range , from from ir to uv . the pattern formed by the structures",
    "was chosen to be concentric circles of sub - wavelength grooves with the appropriate depth .",
    "this patern is able to generate lg beams of @xmath11 as explained below .",
    "after the fabrication process the q - plates were characterized using an asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometer and a ccd camera , showing the generation of high quality lg modes .",
    "we also investigated the interaction of the lg beams generated by q - plates with a nonlinear crystal , resulting in second harmonic generation ( shg ) , and how it affects the order and , consequently , the wave front of the incident modes . starting from a pulsed ti : sapphire laser beam with an average power of 3.6w , 120ns pulses centred at @xmath12 nm at 80mhz repetition rate , using different combinations of q - plates and shg in sequence , we produced pulsed lg modes with @xmath13 , 4 and 6 , centered at @xmath14 nm .",
    "form birefringence may arise when sub - wavelength structures of different refractive indices are arranged with some order . according to the effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite , a periodic array of parallel slabs of thickness @xmath15 and refractive index @xmath16 separated by a gap @xmath17 , embedded in a medium of refractive index @xmath18 , as depicted in fig .",
