    "lattice qcd results for hadronic matrix elements governing neutral @xmath3 and @xmath0 mixing are important elements in the quest to determine the ckm parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5.@xcite _ ab initio _ calculations of form factors for @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath0 exclusive semileptonic decays can be combined with experiment to obtain ckm matrix elements , complementing other determinations , e.g.  through inclusive decays . furthermore , many of the lattice calculations in the charm sector will be testable at current experiments , notably cleo - c.@xcite    the effects of light sea quark masses are now included in present state - of - the - art lattice simulations .",
    "the first round of results showed that cleanly computable , or `` golden , '' quantities agree with experiment within the few percent lattice uncertainties.@xcite this is in sharp contrast to quenched lattice calculations , which neglect sea quark effects and have 10 - 20% discrepancies .",
    "having shed the quenched approximation and its errors , lattice calculations are in a position to make an even greater impact on flavor phenomenology .",
    "this talk briefly summarizes our recent work on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay constants and the form factors describing @xmath7 decay .",
    "the @xmath1 decay constant is straightforward to compute since no extrapolations in the valence quark masses are needed .",
    "we recently computed it to be@xcite @xmath8 this represents the current state - of - the - art because effects of 2 light and 1 strange sea quarks are included .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty is estimated to come from higher order terms in the perturbative matching of lattice nrqcd to continuum qcd.@xcite prospects for reducing that uncertainty lie in a future 2-loop matching calculation or a partially nonperturbative estimate .",
    "the calculation of @xmath9 requires significantly more work .",
    "the light quark mass extrapolation is done using chiral perturbation theory ; however , the simulations must be performed at light enough masses that the leading order terms are sufficient .",
    "1 ( left ) shows our progress computing @xmath9 .",
    "we vary both the valence and sea quark masses which will permit a partially quenched analysis.@xcite recent work has focused on techniques to improve the signal - to - noise ratio for the correlation functions we compute.@xcite the leftmost 2 points in fig .",
    "1 ( left ) illustrate a dramatic improvement in statistical resolution . the large uncertainty due to perturbative matching will cancel in the ratio @xmath10 , allowing us to tighten the @xmath11 constraint .",
    "we recently presented preliminary results for the @xmath7 form factors.@xcite fig .",
    "1 ( right ) shows the form factors @xmath12 and @xmath13 as functions of momentum transfer .",
    "simulations can presently be carried out only at large @xmath14 . as @xmath14 decreases , the pion momentum increases and discretization errors which scale like @xmath15 become sizable .",
    "after extrapolating the light quark mass to its physical value , the form factors are fit well by the beirevi - kaidalov ansatz.@xcite one can integrate the form factors and combine the result with the @xmath16 lifetime and the experimental branching ratio for @xmath17 to obtain @xmath18.@xcite the lattice errors can be decreased if the integration in done only over a range of @xmath14 for which we have data ; this result is then combined with the branching ratio for decays with @xmath19 gev@xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately applying the momentum cut increases the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the preliminary results for both procedures are @xmath21",
    "unquenched lattice calculations with quarks light enough to overlap with the region of validity of chiral perturbation theory will lead to much more accurate results for hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the first round of results are already promising .",
    "here we presented results for @xmath22 and @xmath23 form factors . in the absense of quenched artifacts , we are able to study better the leading systematic uncertainties and find ways to reduce them .",
    "ongoing efforts will lead to more accurate determinations of @xmath9 and the mixing parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
