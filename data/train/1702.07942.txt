    "@xcite , comprehensive two - dimensional gas chromatography ( gc@xmath0gc ) has become in the past decade a highly popular and powerful analytical technique for the characterization of many complex samples such as food derivatives , fragrances , essential oils or petrochemical products @xcite . in the field of oil industry , gc@xmath0gcgives an unprecedented level of information @xcite thanks to the use of two complementary separations combining different selectivities .",
    "it is very useful in the understanding of catalytic reactions or in the design of refining process units @xcite .    from an instrumental point of view , much progress has been made since the early nineties on both hardware and modulation systems @xcite .",
    "many modulator configurations are depicted in the literature or nowadays sold by manufacturers . with the use of leak - free column unions ,",
    "many of these systems have become robust , easy to use , without cryogenic fluids handling while providing high resolution . within a series of several consecutive injections , almost no significant shifts in retention times are observed and repeatability of gc@xmath0gcexperiments is nowadays a minor problem .",
    "however , reproducibility of gc@xmath0gcresults for detailed group - type analysis on complex mixtures is still a great challenge due to column aging , trimming or to slight differences in column features .",
    "this results in shifts on retention times that can affect the proper quantification of a single compound , a group of isomers or pseudo - compounds .",
    "experimental retention time locking ( rtl ) procedures have been proposed to counterbalance shifts on retention times but these procedures must be repeated regularly @xcite . on the way to routine analysis for gc@xmath0gc ,",
    "data treatment has therefore become the preferred option to reduce the time to results @xcite .",
    "a common way of treating gc@xmath0gcdata is to quantify compounds according to their number of carbon atoms and their chemical families by dividing the 2d chromatographic space into contiguous regions that are associated to a group of isomers .",
    "this treatment benefits from the group - type structure of the chromatograms and from the roof - tile effect for a set of positional isomers .",
    "for example , for a classical diesel fuel , up to or regions ( often referred to as blobs ) may be defined .",
    "due to the lack of robustness in retention times , this step often requires human input and is highly time - consuming when moving from an instrument to another or when columns are getting degraded .",
    "several hours may be necessary to correctly recalibrate a template of a few hundreds of blobs on a known sample .",
    "this operator - dependent step causes variability in quantitative results which is detrimental to reproducibility . in that goal ,",
    "2d - chromatogram alignment methods , consisting in modifying a recently acquired chromatogram to match a reference one , have been a quite active research area .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new algorithm called barchan which aims at aligning gc@xmath0gcchromatograms .",
    "it relies on a first peak selection step and then considers the alignment of the two point sets as a probability density estimation problem .",
    "this algorithm does not require the placement of anchor points by the user .",
    "the straight - run gas - oil sample named go - sr which is used in this study was provided by ifp energies nouvelles and was analyzed on different experimental set - ups . its boiling point distribution ranges from .",
    "dataset 1 was built by considering two gc@xmath0gcchromatograms obtained on two different experimental set - ups in the same operating conditions with cryogenic modulation .",
    "these gc@xmath0gcexperiments were carried out with an agilent 7890a chromatograph ( santa clara , california , usa ) equipped with a split / splitless injector , a ln2 two - stage 4 jets cryogenic modulation system from leco ( saint - joseph , michigan , usa ) and an fid .",
    "the two evaluated column sets were composed of a first 1d apolar 1d hp - pona column ( , , , j&w , folson , usa ) and a mid - polar bpx-50 column ( , , , sge , milton keynes , united kingdom ) connected together with siltite microunions from sge .",
    "experiments were run with a constant flow rate of , a temperature program from ( ) to at , a offset for hot jets and a modulation period .",
    "of neat sample were injected with a split ratio .",
    "dataset 2 includes a reference chromatogram obtained in the previous conditions and a chromatogram of the same sample obtained with a microfluidic modulation system .",
    "these gc@xmath0gcdata were obtained on a agilent 7890b chromatograph equipped a split / splitless injector , a griffith @xcite type modulation system supplied by the research institute for chromatography ( kortrijk , belgium ) and a fid .",
    "the modulation system consists in two agilent cft plates ( a purged three - way and a two - way splitter ) connected to an accumulation capillary .",
    "separation was performed on a db-1 ( , , ) 1d column and a db-17ht ( , , , j&w ) 2d column .",
    "the modulation period was set to whereas the oven programming and injection conditions were similar to the ones previously described .",
    "barchanis implemented in c and matlab . in - house platform indigo runs it through a user - friendly interface while the proprietary 2dchromsoftware creates template masks ( .idn files ) and 2d images from gc@xmath0gcdata .      the quality of the alignments obtained with barchanwas evaluated by two different ways .",
    "the correlation coefficient cc @xcite as well as the structural similarity index ssim @xcite between the reference chromatogram and the other one were computed .",
    "they directly match global image intensities , without feature analysis .",
    "calculation details for cc and ssim are provided in the supplementary material .",
    "these results were obtained on a restricted area of interest defined by the user .",
    "a second indicator to evaluate the quality of the alignment is the match quality between the barchanadjusted template and a fully manually registered template . in practice , this featural similarity index is performed by comparing quantitative results obtained on chemical families with the template mask and with the barchanoptimized mask .",
    "we may distinguish two classes of alignment methods : the ones that are directly performed on the full chromatographic signal , and the others which require a prior peak selection step .",
    "in the first class , the works of @xcite and @xcite look for shifts minimizing a correlation score between signals . in @xcite",
    ", an affine transformation is assumed between the two chromatograms to register . the recent work of de boer @xcite looks for a warping function parametrized with splines that transforms the chromatogram to be registered into a chromatogram aligned with the reference .",
    "low - degree polynomial alignment is proposed in @xcite .",
    "full image registration @xcite is however limited for applications in gc@xmath0gcbecause of the variability in chromatograms : positions of peaks in the two chromatograms could be similar , but this is not the case of their intensities .",
    "therefore , the majority of alignment methods choose to first extract peaks in the reference and target chromatograms to only register the informative parts of chromatographic images .",
    "thus , among approaches dedicated to chromatogram alignment , the work of @xcite ( focused on quantitative analysis ) deduces local peaks displacements by correlation computations in slightly shifted blocks surrounding peaks .",
    "variations of peak patterns in different experimental conditions ( e.g. temperature ) is studied in @xcite , and exhibits satisfactory results for estimating an affine transformation .",
    "similarly , @xcite also models rigid transformations for lc@xmath0lc ( 2d liquid chromatography ) template alignment .",
    "however , these hypotheses appear to be too restrictive in a general setting . therefore @xcite extended the space of possible deformations by looking for a warping function that transforms signals .",
    "correlation optimized warping ( cow ) is judged effective by @xcite that compares three different registration approaches , including target peak alignment ( tpa ) and semi - parametric time warping ( stw ) for one specific analysis . however , cow is still not satisfactory when incomplete separation and co - elution problems exist as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "instead , the latter uses bilinear peak alignment in addition to cow to correct for progressive within run retention time shifts on the second chromatographic dimension . in @xcite ,",
    "the alignment is performed after embedding the chromatograms surfaces into a three - dimensional cylinder , and the parametrization of the transform employs polynomials .",
    "the distance and spectrum correlation optimization ( disco ) alignment method of @xcite , extended in @xcite , uses an elaborate peak selection procedure followed by interpolation to perform the alignment .",
    "the approach from @xcite also performs peak alignment via correlation score minimization using dynamic programming , comparing favorably to disco .",
    "finally , the work of @xcite performs an assessment of different gc@xmath0gcalignment methods with a new one .",
    "their method requires a manual placement of matching peaks pairs , then the registration is performed differently on each axis : linear deformations along one dimension , and a neighbor based interpolation in a voronoi diagram defined using the alignment anchor points for the other dimension .",
    "the linear constraint is relevant because one dimension displacements are independent of the other dimension elution times .",
    "the requirement of user - defined alignment points is robust to large variations in the reference and target chromatogram , at the expense of time - consuming markers placement .",

    "first , gc@xmath0gcchromatograms of the sample to analyze and the reference 2d image are loaded as images files . then , the user is provided with a brush to surround , in a user interface , the area of interest on both reference and new 2d chromatograms ( see figure [ fig : areas ] ) .",
    "peaks are extracted in those areas ( section [ sec : hmax ] ) .",
    "only one centroid per local maximum is retained for the point set registration in order to diminish computation times and to prevent bias for large peaks .",
    "datasets are then assimilated to centroids of a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) and a weighted noise model is added .",
    "advantage is taken from recent progresses in point set registration , using a probabilistic and variational approach @xcite .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that a complex transformation must be modeled while remaining robust to noise and outliers . in this context , gmms ( gaussian mixture models ) are particularly efficient at reconstructing missing data , which is especially convenient when selected peaks in one point cloud are not included in the other one . finally , model parameters are optimized to yield registered results",
    ". two types of results are produced :    * if a template mask for the reference chromatogram exists , the transformation of the template points leading to a registered template mask is computed .",
    "* an aligned chromatogram may also be produced by computing the transformation of a grid defined as the coordinates of every pixel in an image , and interpolating the target image values at the transformed coordinates .",
    "details on the calculations for every step are provided in the next paragraphs .      despite the good behavior of the employed registration algorithm regarding noise and outliers , it is desirable to extract the most resembling point sets",
    ". therefore , preliminary gc@xmath0gcenhancement @xcite proves useful .",
    "inherent to the gc@xmath0gcexperimentation procedure , fragments of the stationary phase are frequently lost by the column resulting into the presence of hyperbolic lines in the chromatogram .",
    "their differentiation from the real peaks is difficult to automate because of possible overlaps with the chromatogram peaks of interest .",
    "therefore , in our treatments , a rough area of interest is delimited by an operator , taking approximately ten seconds .    rather than using second or third derivatives of the chromatogram @xcite , which require non - trivial parameters to set , we employ the approach of @xcite and",
    "extract the @xmath1maxima of the chromatograms .",
    "simply put , all local maxima having a height greater than a scalar @xmath2 are extracted . starting from an input signal @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ,",
    "the positions of the @xmath2-maxima may be obtained via a morphological opening by reconstruction , noted @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically , this operation is defined as the supremum of all geodesic dilations of @xmath7 by unit balls in @xmath3 .",
    "more details are provided in @xcite and a scheme is displayed in figure  [ fig : hmax ] .",
    "-maxima : only one peak is detected in this example ( dotted line).[fig : hmax],scaledwidth=40.0% ]      to guarantee results where the first point set is similar to the registered point set , while being robust to noise and outliers , we choose to employ a probabilistic approach . supposing that the first point set @xmath8 follows a normal distribution , the coherent point drift method @xcite seeks to estimate the probability density that explains the data @xmath8 as a weighted sum of gaussians initially centered by the second point set @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce our notations as follows .",
    "the first point set of size @xmath10 , corresponding to the coordinates of @xmath11 peaks extracted in the target chromatogram , is denoted @xmath12 .",
    "the second point set @xmath13 of size @xmath14 corresponds to the peak coordinates in the reference chromatogram and is assimilated to centroids of a gmm .",
    "each component @xmath15 is a vector composed of two coordinates denoted @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the vector @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19 line of matrix @xmath8 . adding a weighted noise model to the gmm probability density function leads to :",
    "@xmath20 where the first term takes into account uniform noise weighted by the parameter @xmath21 fixed between 0 and 1 , @xmath22 is a variance parameter to estimate , and @xmath23 is the point cloud transform to estimate . in this work , motivated by a failure of global rigid transformation attempts on our data",
    ", we modeled two different transforms across the two dimensions .",
    "we assume that a rigid displacement occurs along the @xmath24-axis second very short column , similarly to @xcite , and non - rigid transformations are allowed on the @xmath25-axis first normal length column .",
    "the underlying assumption is a relative anisotropy of the data : two separate pixels in the vertical direction are distant by a much smaller time interval than those aligned horizontally .",
    "the @xmath25-axis is thus potentially subject to more important nonlinear distortions .",
    "thus , we model the transformation @xmath23 of point cloud @xmath9 as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real numbers , respectively a scale and a translation parameter to estimate , and @xmath29 is a vector of length @xmath30 of non - rigid displacements to estimate . the matrix @xmath31 is a symmetric matrix defined element - wise by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a positive scalar .",
    "the minimization of the non - negative likelihood leads to the minimization of : @xmath34 a regularization of the weights @xmath29 , enforcing the motion to be smooth , is necessary for the non - rigid registration , resulting into the following variational problem : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the trace operator of a matrix .",
    "the estimation of parameters @xmath21 , @xmath33 and @xmath37 is discussed in generic terms in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "barchaninherits a similar strategy , within the proposed combined rigid / non - rigid registration procedure .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 $ ] , related to the noise level , is first determined by visual inspection on ten regularly - spaced values .",
    "albeit found to be the most determinant , our chromatograms sharing about the same signal - to - noise ratio , this value is kept constant in all our experiments .",
    "for other data types , multiple figures illustrating different registrations with varying amounts of noise and outliers with an appropriate choice of @xmath21 are presented in @xcite .",
    "the determination of the other parameters and @xmath37 is also discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have set them to @xmath39 and @xmath40 as by default in @xcite .",
    "slight changes did not affect the registration results sensitively .",
    "we employ the expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm @xcite that alternates between :    * the e step : we compute the probability @xmath41 of correspondence for every couple of points . *",
    "the m step : we estimate the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath29 . to that goal , we compute the partial derivative of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath42 and @xmath29 and set them to zero leading to an estimate of every parameter .",
    "details are provided in the supplementary material , as well as the final algorithm itself .",
    "the areas of interest for both dataset 1 and 2 were defined so that every compound present in the sample is taken into account while limiting the number of peaks due to the bleeding ( figure [ fig : areas ] ) .",
    "the detected peaks appear as small blue dots on both chromatograms whereas the selected areas are colored in green and delimited with a purple line .",
