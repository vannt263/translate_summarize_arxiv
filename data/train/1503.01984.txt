    "microbial populations have to constantly adapt in order to survive in a changing environment . for example , a bacterial population exposed to a new antibiotic must evolve in order to exist @xcite . in asexual populations ,",
    "this process of adaptation is driven only by rare beneficial mutations @xcite which provide fitness advantage .",
    "so in order to survive in new environment , enough beneficial mutations should be available and the beneficial mutations should confer sufficient fitness advantage . while the first factor depends on the mutation rate and population size ,",
    "the second factor is determined by the underlying fitness distributions .",
    "even though we have some understanding about the mutation rate of different microbial populations , the full fitness distribution is more complex and relatively little is known about it .",
    "but for moderately adapted populations ( i.e. fitness of the wild type is high enough ) , rare beneficial mutations which occur in the tail of the fitness distribution can be described by the extreme value theory ( evt ) as proposed first by gillespie @xcite .",
    "the evt states that the extreme tail of all distributions of uncorrelated random variables ( fitness , in this case ) can be of three types only . depending on whether the tail of underlying fitness distribution is truncated or decaying faster than a power law or as a power law",

    "interestingly , all the three dbfes have been observed in experiments on microbial populations @xcite .",
    "while the exponential distribution belonging to the gumbel domain has been most commonly seen @xcite , in recent times , the distribution of beneficial mutations belonging to weibull @xcite and frchet @xcite domains have also been observed .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown analytically and numerically that qualitatively different patterns occur in the adaptation dynamics of populations in different evt domains of dbfes in low mutation regime @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that the fitness gain in a fixation event follows the pattern of diminishing returns in weibull domain , constant returns in gumbel domain and accelerating returns in frchet domain , and thus indicates that this quantity can be used to predict the dbfe .",
    "but these observations are restricted to strong selection - weak mutation ( sswm ) regime in which the genetic variation in the population is minimal , that is , only one beneficial mutation is present in the population in the time interval between its appearance and fixation @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether the relationship between the adaptation dynamics and the dbfe mentioned above holds for large populations as well , where there might be more than one beneficial mutation competing for dominance in the population .",
    "the main aim of our study is to address this question and to see if the fitness gain in a fixation event can be used for predicting the dbfe in a more general scenario .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with the populations in which a large number of mutants are produced at every generation .",
    "hence , more than one beneficial mutation is expected to be present at the same time @xcite . in this case",
    ", the beneficial mutations will compete with each other as has been observed in different experimental populations @xcite . in this high mutation regime , as a result of the competition among the beneficial mutations , the rate of adaptation slows down .",
    "the fitness advantage due to the mutations that get fixed is much higher , since the availability of more mutations results in allowing only the best ( fittest ) mutation to get fixed @xcite . a clear comparison of the population fraction of new mutants appearing in the population for two mutation regimes is given in fig .",

    "we have also explored other criteria for defining the leader as the most populated class and find that our main results are robust with respect to the change in criteria ( data not shown ) .",
    "every change of leader is counted as a _",
    "step_. in the high mutation regime the population is spread over many sequences and a sequence can produce two or more mutants each of which may become leaders at different time steps .",
    "however , in the sswm regime , the whole population is localized at a single sequence with a fixed fitness and can only move to a different sequence with higher fitness one mutation away .",

    "[ sch_1](b ) and the leader change is not obvious from the figure .    various quantities like the fitness difference between successive leaders and the average number of mutations in the leader are averaged only over the walks that take the step .",

    "the straight line in all plots shows @xmath52 . ]    in the low mutation regime , the population for the most time is localized at a single sequence and produces @xmath13 mutants at every time step .",

    "these panels also indicate that the value of this constant increases with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "this is because in the case of bounded distributions with @xmath5 , the fitness of beneficial mutant produced is expected to be closer to the parent fitness . in other words ,",
    "mutations are nearly neutral and thus it takes longer time to take over the population as shown in fig .",
    "[ sch_1](a ) .",

    "[ classes](a ) .",
    "we can clearly see from the top panels of fig .",
    "[ classes ] that number of classes increases with decreasing @xmath1 even in high mutation regime . also , the average number of classes present at a time is much higher in this regime .",
    "this makes sense because the fitness of the classes belonging to @xmath48 can not be very different from each other ( can only vary between @xmath53 and @xmath10 ) which makes it possible for many of them to exist in the population .",
    "the maximum fitness of the classes belonging to @xmath50 distribution will , on an average be much higher than all others ( since the distribution is unbounded with a fat tail ) , thus out - competing the others in the population .      in the low mutation regime",
    ", the average number of mutations in the leader is expected to be very close to the step number since the genetic variation in the population is low and any mutation that escapes drift quickly takes over the population @xcite .",
    "we verify this point via simulations as depicted in fig .",
    "we find that the mutation number equals the step in all the three evt domains of the dbfe in the low mutation regime for the initial steps .",
    "however in the high mutation regime , the number of mutations in the leader of any step differs between the three dbfe domains .",
    "when the mutation rate is increased , the genetic variation of the population and the significance of clonal interference also increases . in the high mutation regime",
    ", the number of mutations in the leader is found to be less than the step number in all the three dbfe domains .",
    "this is because there is a chance that different mutants originating from the same parent class can become the leader of the population at different times .",
    "this decrease from the step number is the minimum for the fat - tailed distributions and maximum for the truncated ones , as shown in fig .",
    "this result is consistent with the number of classes present in the population as discussed in the previous section . in the frchet domain ,",
    "since the clonal interference is minimal , mostly a mutant originating from the present leader will become the next one . in the weibull domain , due to the large number of classes present in the population",
    ", mutants originating from the same class can become the leaders at different time points .      from our simulations , we find that the average fitness of the first mutant fixed in the population , @xmath54 increases linearly with the initial fitness , @xmath55 for all @xmath1 in the low mutation regime and for @xmath56 in the high mutation regime .",
    "so we can write @xmath57 where the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants . in the low mutation regime , where the population for most times is monomorphic ,",
    "the adaptive walk model has been used to analytically obtain the fitness at the first step , @xmath60 as @xcite @xmath61 where the transition probability @xmath62 in this model , from eq .",
    "( [ theo_f1 ] ) , the coefficient @xmath63 was obtained as @xmath64 for @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath66 for the aforementioned @xmath1 were @xmath67 @xcite . in the high mutation regime",
    "where the adaptive walk model is not applicable , we obtained the values for the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) numerically .",
    "we find that for large @xmath55 , @xmath68 equals @xmath69 and @xmath70 equals @xmath71 for @xmath72 respectively .",
    "the interesting result from our work is that , irrespective of the number of mutants produced in the population , the difference @xmath73 between the fitness of the first step and the initial fitness displays different qualitative trends : increases for positive @xmath1 , approaches a constant when @xmath4 and decreases for negative @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1-f0_allk ] and [ rf0 ] .",
    "we can better understand these increasing and decreasing trends by the following heuristic argument . in both the low and high mutation regimes , for large @xmath55 , the fitness at the first step @xmath74 increases linearly with the initial fitness as given in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and so , we can write the selection coefficient defined as the relative fitness difference , at the first step as @xmath75 in an adapting population , since the fitness of the first step is greater than the initial fitness , the selection coefficient is always positive .",
    "as the fitness distributions belonging to the frchet domain are unbounded with fat tails , high @xmath55 values can be considered in which case , the second term on the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) can be ignored and we can write @xmath76 . thus for @xmath33 , @xmath77 and therefore it follows that the fitness difference at the first step increases with @xmath55 . on the other hand , since the distribution belonging to the weibull domain are truncated , we can invoke the following inequality to explain the decrease in fitness difference with increasing @xmath55 : @xmath78 where @xmath34 is the upper limit of the fitness distribution .",
    "with increasing @xmath55 , the rhs of the above equation decreases which shows that as the initial fitness increases , @xmath79 has to necessarily decrease .",
    "thus the qualitative trends discussed above appear to be determined by the behaviour of the tail ( bounded / unbounded ) , and not by the details of the model .    also , it is interesting to note that while the data points for the exponentially decaying distribution ( @xmath4 ) increase and seem to be approaching a constant in the low mutation regime , the data in the high mutation regime seems to be reducing to approach the same constant .",
    "our simulation results shown in fig .  [ f1-f0_allk ] not only match the predicted theoretical values and validate the claim of different qualitative trends in each evt domain in the sswm regime but also show that the trends hold irrespective of the number of mutants produced in the population .",
    "this result suggests that the qualitatively different trends of the fitness difference ( increasing , constant and decreasing with initial fitness in the frchet , gumbel and weibull domain , respectively ) can be used to distinguish between the evt domains in a more general scenario .    though the fitness difference at the first step is greater in the high mutation regime , when compared with the results in the low mutation regime , when we look at the fitness difference at the first step scaled by the fitness difference obtained when the initial fitness is zero ( insets of fig .",
    "[ f1-f0_allk ] ) , we see that this increase is slower in the high mutation regime compared to the results obtained in the low mutation regime .",
    "this indicates that as the mutation rate increases , though the number of mutants accessed is higher , the difference in fitness compared to a lower initial fitness is not proportionally higher and is in fact lower for all the fitness distributions .      besides the fitness increment at a fixed event of leader change , we also measured the fitness as a function of time as shown in fig .",
    "[ fit_fig6 ] .",
    "we observed that even though the fitness increases with time in all the three evt domains , the rate at which the fitness increases depends strongly on the dbfe .",
    "this rate has an initial fast transient phase , after which it slows down .",
    "the initial transient phase is strongly dependent on the initial condition as well as the mutation rate as shown in [ ra_ic ] .",
    "the increase in fitness is fastest for the lowest initial condition , but it approaches the same fitness value as in the case of higher initial fitness in few generations . the time taken for populations of different initial fitness to reach the same fitness value depends on the mutation rate : for @xmath80 , it takes about @xmath81 generations , whereas for @xmath82 , it is approximately @xmath83 generations . even after this transient phase , the rate of increase in average fitness ( @xmath7 ) with time depends on the mutation rate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fit_fig6 ] .",
    "this is because of the fact that , when a large number of mutations are available at the same time , a highly fit mutant can invade the population and give a large fitness increment .",
    "so the fitness of a highly fit mutant sequence would be greater in the high mutation regime compared to the one in low mutation regime .",
    "the maximum fitness value reached in @xmath84 generations , in the case of frchet distribution is about @xmath85 times more for high mutation regime , which is consistent with the expectation from eq .",
    "( [ fmax ] ) . even beyond this point we noticed that the fitness is still increasing . in the same way",
    ", gumbel distribution also shows a significant increase in maximum fitness reached in high mutation regime compared to the sswm regime ( about @xmath86 times ) . here",
    "also we found that the fitness is still increasing beyond the time point till which we tracked the dynamics .",
    "the bounded distribution ( weibull ) reaches near the upper bound in sswm and evolves slowly .",
    "but the fitness reaches a fitness plateau in high mutation regime and rate of adaptation becomes zero as can be seen in fig .  [ fit_fig6 ] .",
    "from this we observe that the rate of change of fitness depends strongly on the properties of the underlying dbfe , which suggests that looking at this quantity can help us in distinguishing the dbfes .",
    "so we measured the fitness increment defined as @xmath87 at each step .",
    "the @xmath88 initially increases , then slowly decreases and settles down to a zero as shown in fig .",

    "[ ra_fig2](a ) , we can see that each type of dbfe considered shows a different rate of decay .",
    "weibull domain has a faster decay with @xmath92 , gumbel domain has @xmath93 @xcite and frchet domain @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "we observed that the same trend holds in high mutation rate regime as well , where @xmath91 values are slightly larger in all cases . in this regime",
    "also @xmath95 , @xmath10 and @xmath96 for weibull , gumbel and frchet domains respectively as shown in fig .",
    "[ ra_fig2](b ) . in the high mutation regime , in the case of weibull distributions fitness reaches a plateau in few generations , after which its rate of change goes to zero , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ ra_fig2](b ) . the theoretical prediction for the fitness at every time step for the unbounded distributions belonging to the gumbel and frchet domains was obtained by park and krug @xcite in the low mutation regime .",
    "the comparison of our simulation data with these predictions shows a very good agreement in gumbel domain and in frchet domain ( up to a constant ) . in this work ,",
    "we have considered the bounded distribution also and observed that its rate of decrease is faster with an exponent greater than one , which was not considered in the previous studies .",
    "we observed that even in high mutation regime , the exponent @xmath91 shows the same behaviour . in this regime",
    "the rate of change of fitness has been calculated only for exponential distribution belonging to the gumbel domain @xcite and their prediction matches with our data . in this work , we have obtained a complete picture by studying the rate of change of fitness numerically for the other two evt domains as well .",
    "thus , the second main finding from our study is that in all dbfes , the fitness difference at each time step decreases with time as given by eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) and we can distinguish between the three evt domains of dbfes by looking at the exponent @xmath91 . a comparison of our results with the existing literature is given in table [ table ] .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to determine the quantities which can be used to distinguish the different extreme value domains of the dbfe .",
    "previous studies @xcite have found that in an adapting population , the fitness gain at each fixation event shows qualitatively different trends in the three dbfe domain , when the number of mutants produced in the population is much less than one at every generation ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the focus of this work is to explore the parameter regime in which the number of mutants produced is much above one ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "when the mutation rate is high , the population becomes polymorphic and the better mutants existing in the population compete with each other . from our study",
    "we have observed that the qualitative trends found for fitness difference when a new mutation establishes in the low mutation regime hold irrespective of the number of mutants produced .",
    "thus this study suggests that fitness difference between the successive mutations that spreads in the population is a very important and robust quantity that can be used to predict the dbfes in a more general scenario .    from our simulations",
    ", we see that as the initial fitness is increased the fitness difference at the first step given by @xmath99 reduces , approaches a constant or increases with initial fitness in the weibull , gumbel and frchet domains , respectively .",
    "we can understand these trends by a heuristic reasoning as discussed in detail in the results section .",
    "this argument explains the increase in @xmath99 with @xmath55 for unbounded power law distribution and shows that the trends are determined by the behaviour of the tail ( bounded / unbounded ) , and not by the details of the model .",
    "another important measure in understanding the dynamics of adaptation is the rate at which it occurs .",
    "most of the previous studies which measured the adaptation rate have only considered exponentially distributed fitness distributions @xcite .",
    "a previous study by park and krug @xcite also considered dbfes belonging to frchet domain but only in the sswm regime ( see table [ table ] ) . in this work ,",
    "we have extended the previous studies by numerically measuring the rate of change of fitness for bounded distributions also .",
    "we have measured the rate of change of fitness in all the three evt domains of the dbfe in both low and high mutation regimes .",
    "we observed that in all the cases , the rate of change of fitness decreases with time as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 for weibull , @xmath93 for gumbel @xcite and @xmath102 for frchet domains @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the distribution of beneficial fitness effects can be inferred by two methods . in the first method ,",
    "mutations are introduced in the wild type sequence and those that confer a fitness advantage are separated and their distribution of fitness effects are determined . by this method ,",
    "dbfe belonging to all the evt domains have been observed @xcite . in contrast , here we focus on learning about dbfe via adaptation dynamics .",
    "though many works have tracked the dynamics of the population during adaptation @xcite , in most of them only the selection coefficient of the mutant fixed was measured . in our study , we have observed that the selection coefficient as given by eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) always decreases , with the increasing initial fitness or increasing steps as shown in [ fig5 ] .",
    "hence this quantity is not useful to distinguish between the evt domains .",
    "however , from our study we observe that the fitness difference between steps shows different patterns depending on the evt domain of the dbfes in both the high and low mutation regimes and can be used to distinguish between the evt domains .    in this work",
    ", we have numerically shown that the fitness returns in each evt domain is very robust and holds even when the number of mutations produced is large ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "fitness difference can be measured in experiments , for example as in @xcite .",
    "we suggest that experiments can predict the evt domain of dbfe by measuring the fitness difference between successive mutations fixed in the population , or even from the fitness of the first mutation , when the initial fitness is varied .",

    "<S> adaptation of asexual populations is driven by beneficial mutations and therefore the dynamics of this process , besides other factors , depend on the distribution of beneficial fitness effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that on uncorrelated fitness landscapes , this distribution can only be of three types : truncated , exponential and power law . </S>",
    "<S> we performed extensive stochastic simulations to study the adaptation dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes , and identified two quantities that can be used to distinguish the underlying distribution of beneficial fitness effects . </S>",
    "<S> the first quantity studied here is the fitness difference between successive mutations that spread in the population , which is found to decrease in the case of truncated distributions , remain nearly a constant for exponentially decaying distributions and increase when the fitness distribution decays as a power law . </S>",
    "<S> the second quantity of interest , namely , the rate of change of fitness with time also shows quantitatively different behaviour for different beneficial fitness distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns displayed by the two aforementioned quantities are found to hold for both low and high mutation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how these patterns can be exploited to determine the distribution of beneficial fitness effects in microbial experiments . </S>"
