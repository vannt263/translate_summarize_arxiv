    "we show that this interaction between rod and sphere is short range , occurs for spheres of various materials and sizes , including spheres below the rod length .",
    "while the spheres appear to attract the rods , the stokesian fluid environment precludes any net force or torque being exerted upon them .",

    "the positions of the rods and spheres are tracked using optical microscopy ( nikon eclipse 80i , 40@xmath5 ) , a digital camera ( lumenera infinity 1 - 3 ) , and image analysis ( imagej and matlab ) . in the absence of passive spheres , the moving rods turn , flip , and",
    "disperse over time as reported previously  @xcite .",
    "the presence of passive spheres significantly alters the trajectories of self - propelled rods ( fig .",

    "when a self - propelled rod encounters a sphere , it typically orbits around it ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) .",
    "the rod can move around a succession of spheres and either continue to turn in the same sense ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) or switch the handedness of its circular orbit ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c ) .",
    "this phenomenon of rods orbiting around spheres occurs across a wide range of materials and sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]d - f ) .",
    "we have used rods of different lengths ( 1 , 2 , 4@xmath2 m ) and spheres of various diameters ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 20 , 125@xmath6 m ) made of glass , polymerized 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate ( tpm )  @xcite , poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) , and polystyrene .",
    "these materials have different surface properties but this does not affect the capture effect .",
    "self - propelled rods are captured by all spheres that remain close to the substrate by gravity , including glass beads as small as 1@xmath2 m in diameter ( half the rod length in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]e ; see movie  s2 ) . on a sheet of mica with cleavages which act as nearly vertical walls on a horizontal surface , the rods are transitorily trapped along the walls in a similar fashion to what has been reported before  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that the rods are captured by confining walls with a variety of shapes and materials , and suggests that the capture effect may be hydrodynamic in origin .",

    "to answer this we use inert tpm spheres with an embedded piece of hematite acting as a marker  @xcite .",
    "the rotational diffusion of the sphere is slow compared to the orbiting time of the rod , and the orientation of the marker remains apparently unchanged ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and movie  s3 ) .",
    "a fourier frequency analysis of sphere displacements shows that while the sphere does fluctuate slightly because of brownian motion , there is also an oscillation of the sphere at the same frequency as the rod orbital motion .",
    "however , this effect is quite small .",
    "the nearly constant rod speed and the lack of sphere rotation suggest that the rods hardly experience any additional drag despite moving close to the solid spheres .",
    "this direct experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the rods generate a local propulsive flow along their surface  @xcite as examined in our theory below .",
    "there are several possible mechanisms of trapping .",
    "chemical gradients induced by fuel - consuming rods may affect rod movement .",
    "however , in our system diffusion quickly restores any local changes in fuel level because the peclet number @xmath9 is small , where @xmath10 m/s is the typical speed , @xmath11 m the sphere diameter , and @xmath12m@xmath13/s the fuel diffusivity .",
    "the consumption rate of the fuel is negligible over the typical duration of our experiments .",
    "this is consistent with the swimmers having little loss in speed when orbiting a sphere .",
    "long - range hydrodynamic effects may enable swimmers to approach a solid surface if they are represented by an extensile force dipole ( pusher )  @xcite , though our rods experience only short - range interactions with spheres as confirmed below .",
    "the rods are slightly curved and tend to move in curved paths with typical curvature @xmath14m@xmath15  @xcite , so they could slide along flat  @xcite and curved surfaces with curvature much less than @xmath16  @xcite . however , we observe rods orbiting around spheres with diameter as small as 1@xmath2 m , which has curvature much greater than @xmath16 .    in our interpretation , aside from thermal fluctuations , the rods move towards a surface because the local flow field is modified by its presence .",
    "this is demonstrated in a simplified model based on lubrication theory .",
    "such a motion would not occur for an object towed by a force parallel to a solid boundary due to the symmetry and time - reversibility of stokes flow .",

    "one consequence is an expression for the swimming speed @xmath48 which is independent of the distance @xmath18 between the swimmer and the wall .",
    "in addition , no force is exerted on the wall .",
    "these are consistent with the rods nearly maintaining their speed and exerting little drag on the spheres in our experiments ( fig .",

    "we now consider a simple class of swimmers with constant slip @xmath49 on a portion of their surface @xmath50 and no slip @xmath51 elsewhere .",

    "there are effectively two walls : the spherical surface and the underlying substrate .",
    "our theory would apply not only to the sphere as the wall but also to the substrate .",
    "lubrication effects may induce self - propelled rods to move vertically downwards in the same direction as the gravitational force , which likely reduces the sedimentation height of self - propelled rods compared to that of diffusive rods  @xcite . as a result the self - propelled rods orient towards the thin gap between the walls of the sphere and the substrate , though the effect may be weaker in 3d than in our 2d model .",

    "[ fig:5]a ) .",
    "this is measured by sampling the distance from a given rod to the nearest sphere over time , excluding cases where the rod has multiple spheres within three sphere radii .",
    "for passive rods in water , the density is nearly uniform everywhere except below the sphere , where the density decreases to zero .",
    "active rods also have a uniform distribution away from the sphere , but in contrast to passive rods now show a sharp peak below the sphere .",
    "these features for self - propelled rods are consistent with the hypothesis of capture through short - range interactions .",
    "further , hydrodynamic interactions induced by the rod s propulsive mechanism enable the spheres to capture self - propelled rods but not passive ones .      while our deterministic model predicts that swimmers move closer to a solid surface , fluctuations may cause them to move away or remain at some characteristic distance . in our experiments",
    "the trapping is transitory , and we observe that the trapping times are typically less than 5 seconds and have an exponential distribution with decay rate @xmath55s@xmath15 ( fig .",

    "highly curved rods that move in small circles tend to either remain trapped for relatively long times or are hardly trapped , depending on whether they approach a sphere with the trajectory curving towards or away from the sphere , respectively .",
    "one possible interpretation of this is that the rods are curved towards the sphere while they are trapped until thermal fluctuations flip them over @xcite and enable them to escape .",
    "we have developed a numerical model by including thermal fluctuations in the orientational dynamics and defining a critical angle for escape ( see materials and methods ) .",

    "swimmers with an effective slip on a majority of their surface , including phoretic particles  @xcite and motile ciliates  @xcite , move without causing much disturbance to colloidal particles .",
    "this suggests that phoretic particles can move stealthily , with little perturbation to the surrounding fluid and objects within it .",
    "still , the swimmers themselves are captured by solid boundaries and can accumulate in spatially constricted regions , unlike passive particles .",
    "this may offer insight into the hydrodynamic effects in cell adhesion and feeding , as well as suggest strategies to filter groups of swimmers through the confined spaces of capillaries , microfluidic devices , and porous media .",
    "our results also bring into question the use of colloidal tracers as probes in out - of - equilibrium systems , as for example in measuring the effective temperature of an active bath @xcite .",
    "the tracers may not fully capture the complex swimmer movements and enhanced fluid mixing which could emerge in concentrated suspensions .",
