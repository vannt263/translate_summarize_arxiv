    "because of their ubiquity in nature , nonequilibrium growth processes have been the subject of numerous studies during the last two decades @xcite . remarkably ,",
    "these studies revealed very general properties of growing interfaces that are encountered in a large variety of growth processes , ranging from crystal growth to tumor growth . in this context , due to its obvious technological relevance , thin film growth has been one of the major research thrusts .    from the theoretical point of view , many important insights into the universal aspects of nonequilibrium growth processes have been obtained through the study of stochastic differential equations and of simple model systems @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest approach is due to edwards and wilkinson @xcite who described the surface growth due to particle sedimentation by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the surface height at time @xmath2 at a site @xmath3 of a @xmath4-dimensional substrate ( of area @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 represents a constant flux of deposition .",
    "the physical origin of the `` diffusion constant '' @xmath7 can be traced to the surface tension as well as @xmath8 , the temperature of the substrate . when noise is added to this and",
    "the process is viewed from a co - moving frame of the steady state ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , we arrive at the stochastic edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and covariance @xmath12 .",
    "a microscopic realization of the edwards - wilkinson equation was soon proposed by family @xcite ( see also ref . [ ] for a recent more in - depth comparison of that model with the ew equation ) . in the random deposition with surface relaxation ( rdsr )",
    "process particles drop from randomly chosen sites over the surface . instead of sticking to the surface at the point of impact",
    ", the particles are allowed to explore the nearest vicinity of that point and are finally incorporated into the surface at the neighboring site with lowest height .",
    "this diffusion step smoothes the surface and yields correlated growth .",
    "the roughness of a growing surface is characterized by the time dependent mean interface width @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean surface height at time @xmath2 . in many instances",
    "the mean interface width ( after an initial regime of random surface growth when starting from a flat initial condition ) displays a power - law dependence on time , @xmath15 , before saturating at a value @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the size of the system .",
    "the growth exponent @xmath18 and the roughness exponent @xmath19 are universal quantities that characterize large classes of growth systems belonging to the same growth universality class .",
    "thus for the edwards - wilkinson universality class one finds for a one - dimensional substrate @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "other universality classes have also been found @xcite , some of which , as for example the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite and the conserved kpz universality classes @xcite , are of direct relevance for thin film growth .",
    "the morphology of growing structures can depend crucially on experimental parameters as for example the flux of deposited particles or the substrate temperature @xcite .",
    "different experimental groups have reported a temperature dependence of the roughness of growing or sputtered surfaces , and temperature dependent values of the growth exponents have been found in some systems @xcite .",
    "systems for which this has been observed include homoepitaxial growth on cu(001 ) @xcite , ag(100 ) @xcite , and ag(111 ) @xcite , amorphous thin - film growth @xcite , growth of cdte polycrystalline films @xcite , molecular - beam epitaxy growth of si / si(111 ) @xcite , as well as ion - sputtered si(111 ) @xcite , ge(001 ) @xcite or pt(111 ) @xcite surfaces .",
    "the dependence of the roughness on temperature can be rather involved , yielding different types of behavior for different systems , depending on how diffusion takes place and whether additional smoothening mechanisms are present . in many instances",
    "one observes that growth becomes increasingly rougher with decreasing temperature , yielding an increase of the value of @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , some experiments @xcite revealed an increase of the global roughness with temperature .",
    "the observation of a transition between different dynamic scaling regimes due to a change of experimental conditions is very intriguing and raises the question how a growing surface evolves from one regime to another after a sudden change of , for example , the substrate temperature .",
    "we are not aware of any experimental study of growth processes where this kind of protocol has been implemented . however",
    ", we expect that the intriguing results reported here will motivate future experimental studies along similar lines .",
    "in this paper we discuss exact results derived from the ew equation with a variable diffusion constant , which allows us to investigate systematically the changes in the surface roughness in case growth conditions are changed _ during _ the growth process .",
    "interestingly , different dynamic regimes are encountered , some of which are characterized by a power - law relaxation . here",
    ", we do not have a specific experimental system in mind .",
    "instead , our interest is broader , namely , to understand universal responses of a growing surface to sudden changes of experimental parameters through the study of simple models .",
    "it is to be noted that our study is complementary to an earlier investigation due to majaniemi , ala - nissila , and krug @xcite .",
    "similarly to our work , these authors studied the impact of a change of growth conditions on processes described by linear growth equations . whereas we discuss in the following the effects of a variable diffusion constant , majaniemi et al .",
    "analyzed how the growing surface reacts to a change of the noise in the system .",
    "there is also a second , theoretical motivation for our study",
    ". sudden changes of external conditions , as for example due to a temperature quench , have been investigated in recent years in a large variety of systems , ranging from magnetic systems to glasses @xcite . in the most common",
    "setting , a system initially prepared in some equilibrium state is suddenly brought out of equilibrium through a temperature quench . if the system is characterized by slow , non - exponential relaxation ( as it is the case for a ferromagnet quenched to or below the critical point ) , interesting nonequilibrium processes and aging phenomena are observed @xcite .",
    "some studies also focused on slow relaxation encountered in up - quenches in which a magnetic system initially in the ground state is quenched to the critical point @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , slow relaxation is usually not observed when both the initial and final temperatures are below the critical point .",
    "indeed , for models with a discrete global symmetry such as ising or potts models a competing ordered state can not be reached if the starting point is close to one of the minima of the equilibrium free energy .",
    "consequently , non - exponential relaxation is only encountered in this type of quench if the system has a continuous symmetry , as it is for example the case of the @xmath23 model @xcite . as we will show in this paper",
    ", surface growth processes constitute an interesting class of systems where a change of parameters yields a transition from one correlated state to another characterized by a power - law relaxation .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we discuss the dependence of the surface width , derived from the ew equation , on the value of the diffusion constant .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the time evolution of the surface roughness following a sudden change of the diffusion constant .",
    "we thereby identify different dynamic regimes and present a dynamic phase diagram that summarizes the possible responses of the growing interface .",
    "finally , we end with a summary and outlook in section iv .",
    "in order to study the effect of a change of external conditions on simple growth processes we consider the edwards - wilkinson equation ( [ eqew ] ) with a variable diffusion constant @xmath24 ( a microscopic realization of this process has recently been discussed in @xcite ) . when describing a deposition or growth process by this equation ,",
    "one implicitly assumes that @xmath24 and the noise amplitude @xmath25 depend on the experimental parameters , as for example the temperature @xmath8 . in the following",
    "we will not need to know the explicit dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath25 on these parameters ( which would be system dependent ) , and study how the interface width changes when changing the value of @xmath24 .",
    "the reaction of the growing surface to a change of the noise has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the stochastic ew equation ( [ eqew ] ) , can be solved exactly to give us for a fixed value of @xmath24 the width  ( squared ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 and the sum is over @xmath28 $ ] but _ excluding _ the zero mode : _  _ @xmath29 . in figure",
    "[ fig1]a , c we show the time dependence of the surface width for , respectively , the case with fixed @xmath30 at different @xmath24 s and the case with a fixed @xmath31 and various @xmath17 s . as for the rdsr process one distinguishes three regimes separated by two crossover points : a random deposition ( rd ) regime , followed by a ew regime , with a final crossover to the saturation regime .",
    "in contrast to family s original model , the initial rd process is not confined to very early times @xmath32 but might extend to larger times .",
    "in fact , the crossover time @xmath33 between the rd and the ew regimes is shifted to higher values for decreasing diffusion constants and diverges in the limit of vanishing @xmath24 .",
    "as the crossover is smeared out , we identify the crossover point with the intersection point of the straight lines fitted to the two linear regimes in the log - log plots .",
    "we have the identity @xmath34 in the rd regime , yielding the width @xmath35 at the crossover point . in the ew regime",
    "the relation between width and deposition time changes to @xmath36 .",
    "this regime extends up to a second crossover point @xmath37 , whose precise location depends on the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 and beyond which the final saturation regime prevails .",
    "the crossover between the different regimes is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , d where we show the time evolution of the effective exponent @xmath38 /k_n^2}~.   \\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ] for the two cases .",
    "= 3.40 in     we end this section with a few remarks :    * the ( `` first '' ) crossover from the rd to the ew regime , denoted by @xmath39 , depends only on @xmath24 .",
    "for the range of @xmath17 s we explored , we find @xmath40 , with a constant @xmath41 . in the @xmath42 limit , @xmath43 (",
    "as shown in the appendix , see also @xcite ) . *",
    "the ( `` second '' ) crossover from the ew to the saturation regimes , denoted by @xmath44 , depends on both @xmath24 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath45 may be identified with the saturation width , i.e. , @xmath46 @xcite . combining this result with the line drawn through the ew regime , we arrive at @xmath47",
    "( see appendix ) .",
    "with a clear picture of the properties of a surface growing under a _ constant _ diffusion constant , we proceed to study the time evolution of the roughness when @xmath24 is suddenly changed .",
    "to investigate the response of the growth process to this change , we use the following protocol : we start at @xmath48 with a flat surface and let the surface grow at @xmath49 until time @xmath50 , at which point we change the diffusion constant to the final value @xmath51 .",
    "the change of roughness is then monitored through the time evolution of @xmath52 .",
    "as our system displays three different roughness regimes ( rd , ew , and saturation ) , there can be in principle nine scenarios for the change to be arranged .",
    "they can be distinguished conveniently by ( 1 ) @xmath49 , the diffusion constant of the initial growth , ( 2 ) @xmath51 , the final value of the diffusion constant , and ( 3 ) @xmath53 , the time at which @xmath24 is suddenly changed . by choosing these three controls judiciously",
    ", we can access all the scenarios .",
    "however , covering all cases in detail is not the aim of this paper .",
    "instead , we are interested in the new phenomena associated with the @xmath2-dependence of the width , @xmath54 , after ( up- or down- ) quenches . obviously , for @xmath55 , the surface roughness will settle into the value in an `` unperturbed '' system , grown at @xmath51 from the start .",
    "denoted by @xmath56 , it is just expression ( [ eqew ] ) with @xmath57 .",
    "we also refer to this as the `` reference system . '' to highlight the changes , we also study the difference ( with @xmath58 ) @xmath59 between quenched system and the reference . clearly , this quantity reveals how the roughness of the growing surface adapts itself to the new `` experimental '' condition , and behaves very differently for the various cases .",
    "our goal is to map out the regions in the @xmath49-@xmath51-@xmath53 space corresponding to the novel behavior following a quench .    to be precise",
    ", we will evolve the height @xmath60 starting from @xmath61 with @xmath62 to time @xmath53 and then continue with @xmath63 until time @xmath2 . at that point",
    ", we compute the width squared and denote it by @xmath64 .      to set the stage for discussions , we begin with the data for some typical cases , all with @xmath77 , shown in fig . [ fig2 ] . in order to be able to discuss the different cases for a fixed @xmath53",
    ", we must work with a relatively small system : @xmath78 .",
    "the dashed lines in ( a - c ) represent @xmath56 in an unperturbed system . with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ,",
    "the surface is , at the time of the quench , in the ( a ) rd , ( b ) ew , and ( c ) saturation regimes , respectively .",
    "the corresponding differences , @xmath82 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d - f .",
    "the effects of two up - quenches into the rd regime , from the ew ( @xmath83 ) and the saturation ( @xmath84 ) regimes , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a . as fig .",
    "[ fig2]d shows , for quenches into rd , the width @xmath54 can not reach that of the reference system , @xmath56 .",
    "the `` best '' @xmath85 can achieve is a constant .",
    "the physical origin of this behavior lies in the linear growth of @xmath52 in the rd regime .",
    "thus , for two unperturbed systems started at different times ( say , @xmath86 and @xmath33 ) , the difference @xmath87 is just a constant : @xmath88 . in our case , the correlated growth up to time @xmath53 endowed our surface with a smaller @xmath89 than the reference @xmath90 . immediately after the quench , correlated growth",
    "is simply replaced by independent growth of different columns and the width @xmath91 is `` frozen '' in as a kind of `` initial condition '' ( at @xmath92 ) . as a result ,",
    "the difference @xmath93 remains at the value @xmath94 .",
    "of course , if we follow these two systems further in time , @xmath95 will eventually vanish .",
    "turning next to quenches to the ew regime , we found the most interesting behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , e ) .",
    "the difference @xmath96 initially decreases rapidly , before crossing over to a slower , power - law decay at larger times ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath97 for example , for the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]e , we measure close to the end of the time interval the exponents @xmath98 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 for @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for @xmath103 . as we argue below , these are effective values , the asymptotic values of @xmath104 being @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "below we will also discuss in more detail the conditions under which these values can be expected .",
    "finally , for a quench to the saturation regime , @xmath96 decays exponentially : @xmath107 with a decay constant @xmath108 that depends both on the value of the final diffusion constante @xmath51 and on the system size @xmath17 .",
    "= 3.40 in     up to now , we have shown only the simplest situation where the system is well within a given initial regime at the moment of the quench and , in addition , that it has time to relax into a well defined regime of the reference system . clearly ,",
    "as we let the final system evolve further , it may crossover to a different regime ( e.g. , in case of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , d a crossing over to the ew and saturation regimes will take place for larger @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , we should expect the general relaxation process to be quite complex .",
    "the closed forms ( [ eqwsq4],[omega ] ) are not particularly transparent , as they involve all possible crossover behaviors . to shed some light on the various scenarios , we consider some limiting cases where simple properties ( exponentials and powers ) can be extracted .",
    "a straightforward case is @xmath109 , so that @xmath110 is always large . then , the leading decay is exponential , namely @xmath111 , since the other terms in the sum will be much smaller : @xmath112 in the opposite limit , where @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 \\cong ( \\nu _ f-\\nu _ i)s^2k_n^2\\ ] ] to leading order . the summation over @xmath115 then yields , for @xmath116 , a power - law decay : @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath118 .    in order to explore the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath119 in a comprehensive way",
    ", we evaluate numerically the closed form ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath104 can be defined effectively as @xmath120 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the contour plot of @xmath104 as a function of @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "this plot reveals four different regimes : the regime where @xmath124 or @xmath96 is constant ( labeled by @xmath125 ) , two power - law regimes with values @xmath126 and @xmath118 , and finally a regime of exponential decay for large @xmath122 .",
    "the different regimes are separated by crossover regions where the effective exponent does not lock - in into one of the values 0 , 1/2 , or 3/2 .",
    "= 3.40 in     fig .",
    "[ fig4]a shows how the extensions of the four regimes depend on the value of @xmath127 in cases where @xmath128 .",
    "interestingly , an increase of the value of @xmath127 mainly shifts the contours in the @xmath129 _ vs. _ @xmath130 plot along the @xmath131 direction .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b where we plot @xmath132 _ vs. _ @xmath133 .",
    "this way of plotting indeed leads to an approximate data collapse , which gets better for larger values of @xmath134 . that this data collapse is only approximate also follows from inspection of the exact solution ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "still , fig .",
    "[ fig4]b nicely allows us to visualize the extent of the different dynamic regimes for large ratios @xmath127 .",
    "= 3.40 in     finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we discuss the change of the effective exponent @xmath104 as a function of @xmath2 for various values of @xmath121 ( and @xmath77 ) . note that an increasing time @xmath2 corresponds in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] approximately to a cut along the @xmath131 direction , so that we can distinguish three typical scenarios , separated by the dashed lines there . along the upper dashed line ,",
    "[ fig5]a shows the effective exponent rising to the @xmath135 plateau where it remains for a long time before crossing over to the regime where the difference @xmath96 vanishes exponentially fast ( `` @xmath136 '' ) . for the region above this line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we can expect similar results . along the lower dashed line ,",
    "the same behavior is seen , except that the plateau value is now @xmath137 ( fig . [ fig5]c ) .",
    "this can also be expected for the region below this lower dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . between these two protocols ,",
    "a more complex behavior is encountered , as the effective exponent shows some tendency to lock - in at both values 1/2 and 3/2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) .",
    "we should remind the reader that the @xmath138 curves shown here are applicable for all varieties of quenches ( different quench times , as well as different initial and final values of @xmath24 ) as long as the rescaled time @xmath139 is fixed .",
    "= 3.40 in     it is interesting to note that a change of the noise during the growth process also yields a power - law relaxation , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "thus for the one - dimensional ew equation it was observed that @xmath140 if the system is in the ew regime before and after changing the noise of the system .",
    "the situation studied in @xcite is therefore comparable to our case , even though we do observe a richer behavior when changing the diffusion constant .",
    "the morphology and roughness of growing surfaces depend in a crucial way on experimental conditions . motivated by various observations of a change of the roughness universality class when changing experimental conditions , we have studied in this work how a growth process reacts to a sudden change of the diffusion constant .",
    "exploiting the fact that the stochastic ew equation can be solved exactly , we carried out a comprehensive study of the response of the growing interface .",
    "four main relaxation regimes , separated by crossovers , were identified . for extremely long times",
    "any finite system will eventually relax in an exponential way , due to the presence of the saturation regime , but this only takes place after an earlier power - law relaxation . for finite times , a growing surface rapidly reacts to a change of @xmath24 such that its morphology ( roughness ) approaches that of a reference system that was allowed to grow under stable external conditions .",
    "if the change of growth conditions takes place at a time where both the quenched and the reference system are in a correlated growth regime , than the relaxation process is governed by power - laws over many time decades .",
    "this is our main result ( see also @xcite ) , and we expect this to hold true for other systems .    of course , we do not expect that our results for a one - dimensional system can be applied quantitatively to any of the experimental systems in which a temperature dependence of the roughness exponent has been observed .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that these results should be generic for growth processes with a sudden change of external conditions , and that the intriguing signatures revealed in our study can be generalized to more realistic models , so that they can be observed in experiments on physical systems .    from a more theoretical point of view",
    ", our study reveals that growth processes provide one of the rare cases where a power - law relaxation is generically observed when quenching from one correlated state to another .",
    "more specifically , the exactly solvable edwards - wilkinson equation allows us to derive analytical expressions , thus permitting a complete investigation of the various possible scenarios .",
    "it is to be expected that the power - law relaxation encountered at a quench also entails interesting aging processes not studied in the past",
    ". indeed , in the few published studies of aging in growth processes @xcite constant model parameters were always assumed .",
    "our study can be extended in various directions .",
    "on the one hand , we can study quenches in systems where the interface is stabilized not by surface tension , but by a curvature hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest case is given by the noisy mullins - herring equation @xcite .",
    "as this is again a linear stochastic differential equation , we can follow the same strategy as in the present work and investigate the response to a temperature quench by analyzing exact expressions . on the other hand",
    ", we can also extend our study to systems that are of direct relevance for thin film growth : the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite and the conserved kpz universality classes @xcite . as exact expressions for these non - linear systems are not available , we plan to integrate these equations numerically and to simulate quenches in microscopic models belonging to the same universality classes .",
