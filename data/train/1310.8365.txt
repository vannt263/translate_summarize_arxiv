    "the zakharov - shabat system is the non - selfadjoint system of first - order differential equations given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real - valued functions , @xmath3 is the semiclassical parameter , and @xmath4 is the ( complex ) spectral parameter . as is well - known , zakharov and shabat @xcite found this system to be one half of the lax pair for the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath5 writing @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and writing @xmath8 , we put the system ( [ e : tradzs ] ) into the form : @xmath9 we denote the operator on the left - hand side by @xmath10 , having principal symbol @xmath11    in this paper we study the pseudospectrum of @xmath10 , the set where the resolvent of @xmath10 is large .",
    "equivalently , the pseudospectrum of @xmath10 may be defined as the union of the spectra of _ perturbations _ of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus the pseudospectrum is relevant , for example , to the recent numerical experiments of kim , lee , and lyng which suggest @xmath12 convergence of the wkb eigenvalues to the true eigenvalues in the semiclassical limit @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "( they restrict to the case when @xmath14 and @xmath15 is even , bell - shaped , and real analytic . )",
    "we use a standard method of microlocal analysis : we show that if a certain poisson bracket condition is satisfied , appearing as a condition on @xmath10 and on the spectral parameter @xmath4 , then we can explicitly construct quasimodes , starting from a complex geometrical optics ansatz .",
    "this method was used by hrmander @xcite and was rediscovered by davies @xcite , as observed by zworski @xcite .",
    "extensions of this method may be found in the papers of dencker , sjstrand , and zworski @xcite , @xcite , which strongly influenced the work presented here .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following :    [ t : mainqm ] let @xmath16 , let @xmath17 ( that is , a schwartz function ) , @xmath1 , and let @xmath18 be such that for some @xmath19 we have @xmath20 moreover , assume that @xmath21 is the first nonvanishing derivative of @xmath2 , at @xmath22 , of order @xmath23 ( so @xmath24 )",
    ". then there exists @xmath25 , and for any @xmath26 there exists @xmath27 with @xmath28 and some constant @xmath29 such that @xmath30    here it is most practical to state the result in terms of derivatives of @xmath2 .",
    "however , as emphasized by dencker , sjstrand , and zworski @xcite , @xcite , the underlying general mechanisms are the repeated poisson brackets of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath31 , defined as @xmath32 indeed , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the general formulas for higher poisson brackets are rather messy , but the first nonvanishing poisson bracket takes a simple form .",
    "let @xmath35 be the first nonvanishing derivative of @xmath2 of order greater than or equal to two ( @xmath36 )",
    ". then @xmath37 and all other poisson brackets of order @xmath38 are equal to zero .    in sections",
    "[ s : goansatz ] through [ s : finalests ] we prove theorem [ t : mainqm ] , constructing quasimodes and thus proving blow - up of the resolvent as @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , in sections [ s : upperresolv ] and [ s : geommeaning ] we consider upper bounds for the resolvent .",
    "we prove that the genuine spectrum is discrete off the real line in sections [ s : sigmas ] and [ s : discreteness ] .",
    "it remains to be seen what happens when the first nonvanishing derivative of @xmath2 is an odd derivative .",
    "we would expect to have a subelliptic estimate ; hopefully in the future we can do something concrete and fairly simple for the case of the zakharov - shabat operator",
    ". it may also be interesting to more carefully study the boundary of the pseudospectrum .",
    "for both of these issues , we would welcome further physically significant examples from the physics community .",
    "* acknowledgement : * the author thanks m. hitrik for suggesting the problem and for helpful conversations .",
    "we take the geometrical optics ansatz , @xmath39 with @xmath40 and we let @xmath41 then for the ansatz ( [ e : goansatz ] ) to formally solve ( [ e : zs ] ) , we group terms in the same order of @xmath42 and thus want @xmath43 @xmath44",
    "in order to have non - zero solutions to ( [ e : mzero ] ) , of course we need to have @xmath45 ; that is , we need @xmath46 to solve the ( complex ) eikonal equation : @xmath47 we note that the turning - point curve , defined to be the set where @xmath48 , is given parametrically by @xmath49 while it is possible for our @xmath4 to lie on the turning point curve ( for a point other than @xmath22 ) , we still have that @xmath50 by the hypothesis on @xmath4 .    near the point @xmath22 , where we choose to take @xmath51 , this has the solution @xmath52 taking taylor expansions and integrating , we get @xmath53(x - x_{0})\\\\      & \\qquad      \\pm\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac {      s''(x_{0})(\\frac{1}{2}s'(x_{0 } )      + \\lambda)+2a(x_{0})a'(x_{0})}{\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2}s'(x_{0})+\\lambda)^{2}+a(x_{0})^{2}}}\\right ]      ( x - x_{0})^{2 } + \\mathcal{o}((x - x_{0})^{3 } ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to prove the theorem in its full generality , we will need to expand @xmath46 to higher orders .",
    "but this is simplified by the fact that , in the final estimates , the important object is the _ imaginary _ part of the phase @xmath46 .",
    "for this we have the following lemma , where for convenience we let @xmath54    [ l : imagphi ] let @xmath55 be the order of the first nonvanishing derivative of @xmath2 at the point @xmath22",
    ". then @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the @xmath58th taylor coefficient , centered at @xmath22 , of @xmath59 , and let @xmath60 denote that of @xmath61 .",
    "we then have , for @xmath62 sufficiently near @xmath22 , @xmath63 as in the statement of the theorem , let @xmath64 be the smallest nonvanishing derivative of @xmath2 of order greater than or equal to two ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "then @xmath66 hence @xmath67\\\\          & \\qquad=\\frac{{\\text{im\\,}}\\lambda}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha}(j!)}s^{(j+1)}(x_{0})(x - x_{0})^{j}+\\mathcal{o}((x - x_{0})^{j+1 } ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so by integrating we finally get @xmath68 which proves the lemma .",
    "since we are taking @xmath46 to solve the eikonal equation , for general @xmath62 the image of @xmath69 is spanned by the eigenvector @xmath70 having eigenvalue @xmath71 . since this eigenvalue is not zero and since @xmath72 , we can diagonalize @xmath73 as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 then , writing ( [ e : mzero ] ) and ( [ e : mrest ] ) in terms of this diagonalization , we want @xmath77 and @xmath78 to satisfy @xmath79 and @xmath80    we will now construct @xmath81 and @xmath82 in detail .",
    "first of all , we want @xmath83 and secondly , we want @xmath84 to be in the image of @xmath73 . therefore , we want both @xmath85 and @xmath86 where the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 are to be determined .",

    "( [ e : abderiv ] ) , we let @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( note that @xmath92 for @xmath62 near @xmath22 . )",
    "then we are to solve the system @xmath93 but this is easily accomplished .",
    "it is now time to complete the quasimode construction by estimating the error generated by taking only finitely many terms in ( [ e : goansatz ] ) , hence making rigorous the asymptotic series .",
    "we take only finitely many amplitude terms : @xmath94 then @xmath95\\\\      & = ih^{n+1}e^{i{\\varphi}/h }      \\left (      \\begin{matrix }      a_{n}'\\\\      -b_{n } '      \\end{matrix }      \\right )      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have solved the eikonal and transport equations as above .",
    "we now assume that @xmath21 is the first nonvanishing derivative of @xmath2 of order greater than or equal to two ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "then , using lemma [ l : imagphi ] with @xmath96 , we choose the sign of @xmath46 such that the leading term @xmath97 is a nonnegative quantity .",
    "then there exists some @xmath98 such that , for @xmath62 sufficiently close to @xmath22 , @xmath99    to conclude the quasimode construction , we let @xmath100 be @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is to be determined .",

    "hence @xmath113 where @xmath114 is independent of @xmath42 .",

    "we can now take @xmath117 to conclude the proof of the theorem .",
    "to obtain upper bounds for the resolvent , we will use the semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus . in this and the following sections",

    "in fact , we immediately take @xmath137 such that @xmath138 . if @xmath139 , then clearly @xmath140 on the other hand , if @xmath141 , then @xmath142 hence @xmath143    moreover , it is now easy to see that @xmath144 .",
    "hence , using the pseudodifferential calculus ( see theorem  4.23 of @xcite ) , @xmath145 is a bounded operator ; that is , @xmath131",
    "in this section we give a simple geometric meaning to ( [ e : detpgeqeps ] ) , as seen in the @xmath4-plane .",
