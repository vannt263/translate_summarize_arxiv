    "for more than a decade now , it has been demonstrated by numerous examples that fluctuation formulas relating to the largest eigenvalues of certain random matrix ensembles are also characteristic of fluctuation formulas for certain random growth models ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . because the precise functional form of the random matrix quantities are known ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ", there are thus precise theoretical predictions for the functional form of the corresponding quantities in the growth models .",
    "very recently , the validity of these theoretical predictions @xcite has been demonstrated by a high precision experiment involving curved interface fluctuations of a growing droplet @xcite .",
    "crucial to the theoretical predictions is the hypothesis of universality of the fluctuation formulas : they depend on some global symmetry properties of the interface ( in particular , is it curved or flat ? ) , but not the details of the microscopic interactions .",
    "this hypothesis is generally unproven , as the results for many of the random growth models rely on the integrability of the particular microscopic choice of parameters .",
    "one recent advance has been to show that the random matrix fluctuation formulas predicted on the basis of exact calculation have been shown to hold true for the continuum kpz equation with narrow wedge initial conditions @xcite .",

    "but for the @xmath3 with distributions different from these solvable cases , the corresponding theorem is not known .    in this paper",

    "it was remarked during the proof of proposition [ p5 ] that another interpretation of the joint pdf ( [ 8 ] ) for the heights in the directed solid - on - solid model is then as a joint pdf for interlaced particles on @xmath66 parallel line segments @xmath9 $ ] , with @xmath67 particles on line @xmath24 .",
    "it was furthermore remarked that this latter model is the so called finitized bead process , studied in @xcite , or more precisely the special case @xmath68 of the finitized bead process ( general @xmath69 and @xmath70 would correspond to the height model of section 2 being defined in a rectangle rather than square ) .",
    "known results for the bead model can then be used to deduce properties of the directed solid - on - solid model .",

    "we remark that if instead of sampling the individual heights from the continuous uniform distribution , they were sampled instead from the discrete uniform distribution on @xmath99 $ ] say ( @xmath100 ) , then our directed solid - on - solid model would be equivalent to boxed plane partitions , of box size @xmath101 .",
    "there is no longer a random matrix approach to the sampling of a typical configuration , but we point out that one recently introduced method @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) has the interpretation as defining a dynamics on the underlying interlaced particle configurations .",

    "we are thus faced with the task of expressing @xmath116 in terms of correlation functions , which is in fact a standard exercise @xcite .",
    "first note that according to the definition @xmath122 expanding the double product and recalling the definition ( [ 3.10 ] ) of the correlation function then shows @xmath123 where the term @xmath124 is taken to equal unity .",
