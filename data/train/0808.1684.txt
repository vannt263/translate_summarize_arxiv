    "parkinson has studied socio - dynamical systems with special focus on bureaucratic and administrative bodies . in his famous book @xcite",
    "he comprises 10 essays which give detailed descriptions of microscopic mechanisms leading to macroscopic phenomena like exponential growth of administrations , impact on the size of executive councils on efficient decision - making , and the relationship between the age of retirement and a company s vital promotion scheme .",
    "these essays are not quantitative , however , the description of these microscopic mechanisms is so clear and brilliant , that they can be easily cast into dynamical models .",
    "we pick three of these essays which are especially well suited for this purpose .    in the first essay ( chapter 4 in @xcite ) , parkinson conjectured on historical evidence that there is a characteristic group size beyond which the ability of this group for efficient decision - making , i.e. the finding of consensus , is considerably diminished .",
    "the empirical findings based on government size , found in the 1950s @xcite , are still valid today to a large extend @xcite . by proposing an opinion formation model for small groups",
    "we provide an understanding for this hypothesis through the existence of finite size effects which lead to this characteristic size ( coefficient of inefficiency ) of decision - making bodies .    in the second essay ( chapter 1 in @xcite )",
    ", we formalize the so - called parkinson s law. we propose dynamical equations for his model of bureaucratic growth and solve them explicitly .",
    "as the main result we derive the phase diagram of this model for the macroscopic evolution of an administrative body .",
    "one phase corresponds to an exponentially growing body , the other to a shrinking one .",
    "the third essay ( chapter 10 in @xcite ) , studies the interrelation between the age of retirement and promotion schemes with the motif force to ensure the presence of career opportunities and prevent the lack thereof , a phenomenon also known as prince charles syndrome. there we show the existence of a unique maximum for the efficiency of a bureaucratic body at the optimum life - time of a worker in the system .",
    "given a promotion scheme and the hierarchy in the system , the optimal age of retirement can be computed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review work on the relationship between the size of a decision - making body and its efficiency @xcite . in section iii",
    "we propose and solve the dynamical equations for a model of an administrative body which evolves according to parkinson s law .",
    "the question when an official within such a body should retire to ensure a maximum of overall efficiency of the administrative body is left for the final section iv .",
    "we interpret our results and conclude in section v.",
    "parkinson discovered what he called the life cycle of a cabinet .",
    "he studied the membership of britain s highest executive council , the cabinet , spanning 700 years , from 1257 to 1955 .",
    "he found that an initially small council steadily increased in size , until growing beyond a size of 20 , shortly after which it was superseded by a new council with the same fate .",
    "the british cabinet went five times through this life cycle within the aforementioned timespan .",
    "he also lists the cabinet sizes of his time revealing that cabinets beyond a size of 21 are only found in communistic countries .",
    "he concludes that it is critical for cabinets to have memberships below this characteristic size ( 21 ) for efficient decision - making within this council ( the coefficient of inefficiency ) .",
    "his explanation for this phenomenon was that as group size increases the influence of individual members decreases ( not only because there are simply more of them , but also because the group is more likely to dissociate into separate subgroups ) .",
    "the less influence a member bears , the more easily new members are admitted to the council which in turn decreases their influence further . in the following",
    "we ask if similar observations can be made with today s data on cabinets .",
    "we then propose a model for opinion formation in small groups whose dependence on the group - size nicely resembles the transition conjectured by parkinson .",
    "versus ( a ) the human development indicator and ( b ) and political stability . the @xmath0values indicate the high significance of negative correlation between them .",
    "we computed the average indicator value for each @xmath1 and binned them with intervals of two ; errors were calculated by gaussian error propagation .",

    "the green line is a linear least squares fit which intersects the median of the respective distributions at around 20.,title=\"fig:\",height=219 ]      we compiled a database of cabinet sizes @xmath1 , for 197 countries and self - governing territories with data drawn from the cia @xcite .",
    "the results reported in @xcite showed that the majority of cabinet sizes falls in the range between 13 and 20 . to compare cabinet size with its efficiency we made use of indicators provided by the united nations development programme @xcite and the indicator political stability ( ps ) provided by the world bank @xcite .",
    "we processed the data by computing the average of the indicator values for each @xmath1 and tested against the hypothesis that there exists no correlation between them , see fig .",
    "[ indplots ] .",
    "we find negative correlations between the cabinet size and the human development indicator ( hdi ) , see fig .",
    "[ indplots](a ) , and between cabinet size and a series of governance indicators from @xcite revealing that larger cabinets coincide with a more unstable political climate , fig .",
    "[ indplots](b ) .",

    "each individual is a cell with binary opinion ( black or white ) . for each value of @xmath1",
    "we show 4 independent update - runs , all starting with the same initial configurations and the same network . in each run",
    "we show the first four time steps 0,1,2,3 , where time 0 corresponds to the initial configuration .",
    "line 1 is obtained by the iterative application of the opinion formation protocol on the initial configuration in a random sequence of updates . the subsequent lines ( 2,3 )",
    "are obtained analogously .",
    "the actual sequence is seen to play an important role for the final state at time 3 .",
    "we show two different trajectories leading to consensus ( everything white or black at time 3 ) or dissensus ( mixed colors , i.e. opposing factions ) for each size @xmath1.,height=188 ]      decision - making in small groups can be cast into a dynamical opinion formation model @xcite .",
    "each member of the committee is represented as a node in a network and holds a binary opinion , say 0/1 .",
    "each node has a connectivity @xmath2 which is the number of undirected links to other nodes , representing a social influence ( interactions , such as discussions ) two agents exert upon each other @xcite .",
    "each node shares @xmath2 undirected links with other nodes .",
    "thus for @xmath3 the graph is not fully connected and nodes appear which are not directly linked .",
    "we assume the total network to be connected , i.e. there exist no disjoint subnetworks . according to parkinson groups such as cabinets",
    "are typically highly clustered .",
    "therefore a sensitive choice for the fixed network architecture of our model is a small - world network , which has already been shown to be of paramount importance in modelling social interactions @xcite .",
    "each node is connected with its @xmath2 nearest neighbors , then with probability @xmath4 each link is randomly rewired . as a dynamical rule governing the interactions between connected agents we chose a majority rule @xcite with a predefined threshold",
    "@xmath5 $ ] , see @xcite .",
    "when the update is carried out random sequentially , i.e. within one iteration each node is updated one after the other in a random order , this yields exactly the opinion formation model studied in @xcite . here",
    "a node adopts the state of the majority of its @xmath2 neighbors only if this majority lies above @xmath6 , otherwise the node keeps its previous internal state .    to anticipate the evolution of a system specified by the above characteristics , consider fig .",
    "[ traj ] , where four different runs for three choices of cabinet size @xmath1 are shown .",
    "we used parameter settings @xmath7 .",
    "the system is initiated with a random configuration of internal states ( lowest rows , labelled 0 ) , each cell represents one agent in the network with a color corresponding to his binary opinion .",
    "the above rows are derived after updating each node once in a random sequential order .",
    "it becomes apparent that this model favors the forming of clusters , i.e. neighboring nodes tend to share the same opinion  coalitions emerge .",
    "note that for each of the four runs we start with the same initial conditions , thus the difference of the final states is solely due to the random sequential update .",
    "further we see that the final states ( rows number 3 ) can be characterized whether they consist of agents with the same opinion ( consensus ) or whether there are at least two factions of opposite opinions ( dissensus ) .     for four different settings of the model parameters @xmath8 . setting @xmath9 @xmath10",
    "is shown by the blue squares .",
    "for @xmath11 we obtain always consensus here , except the @xmath12 case .",
    "we then find two regimes approximated by a linear fit and separated by a shaded area , where we conjecture the coefficient of inefficiency to lie .",
    "decreasing the connectivity of the group`s network , parameter setting @xmath13 , red left triangles , shifts the position of the shaded transition area and increases the tendency toward dissensus .",
    "adjusting the threshold such that we recover the pure majority rule , @xmath14 , green right triangles , has no impact on @xmath10 due to our choice of @xmath2 , except that we do not find the charles i ' scenario in this case .",
    "lowering @xmath4 and therefore increasing the spatial correlations in the network hardens the finding of consensus too , as can be seen from the settings @xmath15 ( magenta diamonds).,height=226 ]    the question whether efficient decision - making in the group is possible or not translates into the question how likely the group evolves into final state of consensus or dissensus .",
    "we define dissensus @xmath10 as the order parameter of the model : let @xmath16 be the initial population of nodes with internal state 0 and @xmath17 the final population in this state .",
    "we then have @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the heaviside step function and @xmath20 the average over all possible initial conditions .",
    "@xmath16 is drawn with uniform probability from @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , the opinions are randomly assigned to the individual nodes .",
    "@xmath10 gives the expectation value of a final state without consensus and measures the group s proneness to end up in dispute .",
    "we show @xmath10 for four different parameter settings in fig .",
    "[ dn ] . for each curve",
    "we find three distinct regimes . in the region",
    "where the network is fully connected we always find consensus ( except the notable @xmath12 case , to which we will return later ) . then we find two regions of approximately linear growth . between these , the shaded areas in the plot , the slope considerably decreases .",
    "we further see that for lower values of @xmath2 , @xmath10 increases ( because of the emergence of disconnected clusters ) and for less shortcuts , i.e. lower values of @xmath4 and therefore higher spatial correlations @xmath10 also increases .",
    "both mechanisms , lower @xmath2 and @xmath4 , favor the emergence of clusters .    the decrease of the slope after @xmath1 has passed the sizes of the shaded areas can be naturally understood as a finite size effect present for small groups .",
    "this effect is constituted by the considerably increased likelihood to form coalitions in this model , is in one - to - one correspondence to the diminishing influence of the assembly s members .",
    "since the gap between two values for @xmath10 can be understood as the resistance to the cabinet s equivalent expansion , the dynamics proposed by parkinson and the existence of a characteristic size for its functioning , the coefficient of inefficiency , are both reproduced by the behavior of @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ dn ] .",
    "parkinson has noted that there were no cabinets found with eight members .",
    "this is still the case today .",
    "our findings show that there is good reason to avoid this number , at least for certain parameter values , see fig .",
    "historically there exists a famous exception : eight was the number preferred by king charles i for his committee of state . and look what happened to him!.",
    "the famous sentence work expands as to fill the resources available for its completion was a guiding principle for parkinson when he demonstrated that the growth of the administrative staff of the british navy stood in no relation to the work that actually had to be administered .",
    "for example , in the peacetime periods between 1935 and 1954 ( i.e. excluding the even stronger growing staff during world war ii ) the staff of the colonial office steadily increased by an average percentage of 6% a year , from 372 to 1661 , while the colonial territories in the same timespan shrunk dramatically .",
    "the same figure of 6% turns out if one traces the growth of the dockyard staff of the british navy between 1914 and 1928 . during this timespan",
    "the admiralty officials increased by around 80% , while the ships in commission decreased from 62 to 20 .",
    "parkinson suggested to explain this growth by the principle that an official tries to maximize subordinates , not rivals .",
    "this is nowadays soetimes referred to as parkinson s law .",
    "that is , if an official gets promoted ( happening with probability @xmath22 ) this is in real terms carried out by allocating @xmath23 subordinates to him .",
    "we now present a model to understand parkinson s intuition for administrative growth .",
    "we derive the growth rate @xmath24 explicitly , depending on the model parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "further we introduce a drop - out rate @xmath25 , the probability for an official to quit his job , as well as the age of retirement @xmath26 , which gives the typical administrative life - span .",
    "consider @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be fixed and measurable .",
    "the question to determine @xmath26 is left to the next section .",
