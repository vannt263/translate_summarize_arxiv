    "domain walls are planar - like objects , which separates two distinct phases / states of matter .",
    "perhaps the most iconic examples are walls in ferromagnets , where ` domains ' of uniform orientation of magnetic moments are punctuated by thin layers , within which moments change rapidly to accommodate the relative difference .",
    "numerous other examples can be found in solid - state physics .",
    "the concept , however , found its place in various others fields . in theoretical physics ,",
    "domain walls are often used as low energy toy models of both d - branes @xcite in string theory and ` branes ' in the brane world scenario @xcite .",
    "the lowest common denominator in all their incarnations , however , is the existence of distinct phases / states of matter , which makes domain walls prototypes of topological solitons @xcite .    to model a domain wall in field theory , in principle all that is required are discrete and degenerate vacua , which domain wall separates .",
    "the simplest example is a scalar field theory with the double - well potential , the well known @xmath3 kink @xcite .",
    "however , in generic scalar theories , a configuration of more than a one domain wall can not be static , due to attractive scalar forces .",
    "dynamical multi - soliton configurations are therefore difficult to study in such theories , other than via numerical or perturbative methods . only in very special cases , we are able to write - down exact dynamical multi - soliton solutions , such as in the famous sine - gordon model .    hence , to understand multi - domain walls ( and many other topological solitons as well ) , without the need of dealing with dynamics , it is advantageous to use supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theories . in these models ,",
    "attractive scalar forces between solitons can be exactly compensated by repulsive massive vector interactions ( originating from spontaneously broken gauge symmetry ) .",
    "thus , arbitrary configurations of solitons can be static .",
    "solitons with such property are called bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) solitons .",
    "they can be shown to possess the least amount of energy in their topological sector ( so - called bogomolnyi bound @xcite ) and they also partially preserve susy .",
    "bps solitons have a further advantage . instead of dealing with complicated second - order equations of motion ,",
    "bps solitons can be shown to satisfy a much simpler set of first - order equations , correspondingly called the bps equations .",
    "these equations have many interesting properties and attract scientific interest on their own .",
    "if the gauge symmetry is only partially broken by scalar fields  the so - called coulomb phase ",
    "prototypal solitons are magnetic monopoles @xcite and to them related instantons @xcite .",
    "their bps equations can be solved exactly via the famous nahm equations @xcite and adhm construction @xcite , respectively , providing an analytic form for static multi - monopole and multi - instanton configurations .",
    "this reflects the underlying integrability of bps equations in the coulomb phase .    if the gauge symmetry is fully broken by scalar fields  the so - called higgs phase ",
    "the prototype solitons are vortices @xcite and domain walls @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the coulomb phase , similar analytic techniques for solving bps equations in the higgs phase are not available , as they are not integrable @xcite .",
    "although isolated exact solutions were found for domain walls @xcite , they only seem to prove the general rule .    this paper is dedicated to extending the knowledge about exact solutions for solitons in the higgs phase .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on domain walls , but our results have obvious implications to other bps solitons in the higgs phase .    we consider a part of the bosonic sector of abelian @xmath4 susy gauge theory with @xmath0 higgs fields .",
    "such model has @xmath0 discrete vacua and consequently supports configurations of up to @xmath5 elementary domain walls .",
    "we present the model in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , where we also discuss properties of walls and of multi - wall configurations at some length .    to construct bps domain walls we employ the so - called moduli matrix approach ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "this technique involves a change of variables which solves all bps equations identically , except one .",
    "the remaining equation called _ the master equation _ , has the following general form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is proportional to the gauge coupling constant and @xmath8 is the moduli field related to higgs fields and gauge fields via the moduli matrix approach .",
    "we call @xmath9 the ` source term ' since it specifies number , mass and positions of walls .",
    "in fact , together with the boundary condition @xmath10 at the spatial infinity , @xmath11 fully determines the solution .",
    "not surprisingly , the non - linear second order differential equation ( [ eq : masterw0 ] ) is very hard to solve exactly .",
    "indeed , up to now , there is only a handful of exact solutions for special choices of @xmath11 .",
    "chronologically , the first exact solution was a junction of domain walls reported in @xcite .",
    "from this solution , one can extract a single wall solution , which was added to two other exact single wall solutions and one double wall solution in @xcite .",
    "outside of these important findings , the master equation of the type ( [ eq : masterw0 ] ) is believed to be impregnable by analytic means .    in this paper",
    ", we will present many new exact solutions for multi - domain walls .",
    "in particular , we will show that some exact solutions of ( [ eq : masterw0 ] ) , each with different @xmath11 , can be combined to gain novel solutions , with new @xmath11 s .",
    "these solutions , which we call _ chains _ , can under certain conditions generate an unlimited wealth of exact solutions , which we specify in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "furthermore , we will show that beyond chains there is a bewildering maze of exact solutions based upon a family of ansatzes , which we present and study in sec .",
    "[ sec : grinder ] . both of these findings reveal unexpected analytic structure within master equation for domain walls and strongly implies the same for other topological solitons .",
    "we will discuss these implications in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider a @xmath12 gauge theory in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions with @xmath0 complex scalar fields assembled into the row vector @xmath13 and a real scalar field @xmath14 .",
    "the lagrangian is given as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gauge coupling constant and the parameter @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . in the context of supersymmetry , @xmath18 can be identified with the so - called fayet - iliopoulous parameter .",
    "the mass matrix is given as @xmath19 .",
    "notice that the trace part of @xmath20 can be changed arbitrarily by shifting @xmath21 , @xmath22\\to \\mbox{tr}[m]-k$ ] , which leaves the lagrangian unaffected .",
    "we will use this freedom to make all entries in @xmath20 negative ( or zero ) by setting @xmath23 .",
    "the benefit of this choice will be apparent when we discuss positions of domain walls .",
    "also , we can always demand that the masses are ordered @xmath24 , without loss of generality .",
    "this makes @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt following conventions : @xmath26    non - generic values of coupling constants in front of @xmath27 and in the potential @xmath28 allow us to embed this model into a supersymmetric model with eight supercharges by adding appropriate bosonic and fermionic fields .",
    "this ` effective ' supersymmetry enables to reduce the full equations of motion by one order .",
    "the reduced equations are known as 1/2 bps equations .",
    "vacua of ( [ eq : lag ] ) are constant field configurations with vanishing potential @xmath29 .",
    "there are precisely @xmath0 such configurations , which we label as @xmath30 , with the representative values @xmath31    the existence of discrete vacua is what makes domains walls possible . to be specific , since there are @xmath0 vacua we expect there to be a domain wall for every transition between a pair of vacua @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( if @xmath34 such transitions are called anti - walls ) .",
    "thus , there are @xmath35 different domain walls .",
    "let us denote each transition as @xmath36 for brevity . out of these ,",
    "only transitions between successive vacua @xmath37 are considered as ` elementary ' , while other transitions can be showed as composite configurations of elementary walls , as we will discuss in subsection [ sec : master ] .",
    "let us construct 1/2 bps domain walls along , say , the first direction @xmath38 . to that goal",
    "we will assume that all fields depend only on @xmath38 coordinate and , as a gauge choice , we take all gauge fields to be zero @xmath39 .",
    "the bps equations are found using the well - known technique of bounding the energy density from below due to bogomolnyi @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is energy density of the domain wall and @xmath42 is a boundary term .",
    "thus , the energy per unit area ( tension ) of the domain wall is never less than @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a difference of masses of respective vacua . and negative for anti - walls @xmath46 .",
    "in this way the combination @xmath47 is always positive . ]",
    "the minimum @xmath48 is achieved if the following set of first order equations are obeyed @xmath49 parameter @xmath50 labels whether the solution is either a wall ( @xmath51 ) or an anti - wall ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "bps equations ( [ eq : bpsw1])-([eq : bpsw2 ] ) can be reduced to a single second order partial differential equation by using the moduli matrix approach @xcite .",
    "first , let us solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : bpsw1 ] ) identically using the ansatz @xmath52 where @xmath8 is a new field variable and @xmath53 is a row vector of @xmath0 constants , generically called the moduli matrix . notice that the pair @xmath54 does not determine @xmath55 uniquely , since the so - called @xmath28-transformation @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , leave the assignment ( [ eq : moduliw ] ) unaltered .",
    "the second bps equation ( [ eq : bpsw2 ] ) turns into the master equation @xmath58      as an explicit example , let us consider the case @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "there is only one domain wall @xmath61 , which interpolates between the second vacuum @xmath62 at @xmath63 and the first vacuum @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "its tension is @xmath66 .",
    "the generic moduli matrix can be written as @xmath67 by fixing the first entry via the @xmath28-transformation .",
    "parameter @xmath68 represents the position of the wall and we can set @xmath69 by translation symmetry .",
    "the master equation ( [ eq : masterw ] ) in such a case reduces to ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) @xmath72 the general solution of this equation is unknown , although three exact solutions for specific values of the ratio @xmath73 have been found @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these solutions in the next section .",
    "apart from these solutions ( or solving the master equation numerically ) , one can develop a qualitative feeling about the shape of the solution via the so - called infinite gauge coupling limit @xmath74 .",
    "notice that in this limit the left - hand side of ( [ eq : masterw2 ] ) vanishes and right - hand side can be solved algebraically as @xmath75 the difference between an exact solution and @xmath76 is generally confined to a finite region around domain wall as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wall ] .",
    "thus , the general shape of the solution is faithfully represented by @xmath76 .",
    "this is also the reason why the infinite gauge coupling limit is used almost exclusively in studies about bps domain walls , or other solitons in the higgs phase .",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath77 with mass matrix @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are two elementary walls representing the transitions @xmath79 and @xmath80 given by moduli matrices @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "indeed , these choices would produce essentially identical master equations as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterw2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose @xmath83 we obtain a new master equation @xmath84 which is the first example of the so - called composite wall .",
    "this configuration describes the transition @xmath85 .",
    "depending on the value of the parameter @xmath68 , the configuration on its way from @xmath86 vacuum at @xmath87 to @xmath88 vacuum at @xmath89 can approach the @xmath90 vacuum arbitrarily close . for positive and large @xmath68",
    "we can interpret the configuration as a pair of elementary walls separated by the distance @xmath91 . indeed , in the vicinity of the point @xmath92 , where @xmath93 we have@xmath94 which is nearly the transition @xmath79 up to the negligible term @xmath95 , while near the point @xmath96 we get @xmath97 we can shift the field @xmath98 to make the first term in the parenthesis negligible , thus approximately obtaining an equation for the elementary wall @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , for sufficiently big @xmath68 the solution describes a pair of elementary walls located at @xmath99 in the region between the walls , the fields @xmath100 and @xmath14 are nearly at the second vacuum and in the limit @xmath101 , the whole configuration becomes @xmath90 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath68 is close to zero or negative the two walls merge together : they form so - called ` compressed ' wall . in the extreme limit",
    "@xmath102 the master equation ( [ eq : masterw3 ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : masterw2 ] ) and we have pure transition @xmath85 with a single domain wall .",
    "an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : example ] ) was reported @xcite .",
    "again , we will discuss it in the next section .",
    "let us now make a few comments about the general case .",
    "for ease of reference let us repeat here the master equation ( [ eq : masterw ] ) in a fully unpacked way ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) : @xmath103 where @xmath104 are absolute values of moduli matrix @xmath53 and @xmath105 are diagonal elements of the mass matrix @xmath20 .",
    "notice that not all moduli parameters and mass parameters are independent .",
    "we can always make the following transformation @xmath106 without changing the equation .",
    "this redundancy is a manifestation of @xmath28-transfor - mation , translation invariance and reparametrization freedom of the mass matrix .",
    "generalizing what we learned in particular cases , there are @xmath5 elementary walls @xmath37 , which are obtained by setting @xmath107 , @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath110 otherwise . on the other hand , if there are three or more non - zero moduli parameters , we have a configuration of two or more elementary walls . in the maximal case where all moduli are non - zero",
    ", we have everything between a system of well separated @xmath5 elementary walls and a single domain wall @xmath111 .",
    "can we tell which elementary walls are compressed , which are isolated and at what positions walls ( compressed or elementary ) roughly are just from moduli parameters ?",
    "let us concentrate on @xmath112-th elementary domain wall .",
    "we can estimate its position by comparing the factors @xmath113 and @xmath114 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterw3 ] ) . if neither of these numbers ( at given @xmath115 ) is significantly bigger than the remaining factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterw3 ] ) we are nowhere close to either @xmath116 or @xmath117 vacuum and hence we are also far away from @xmath37-th wall . on the other hand , if one of these numbers is much bigger then the rest , we are close to the corresponding vacuum , but again not close to the wall .",
    "obviously , both factor must be equally dominant over remaining terms , in order to be close to @xmath112-th elementary wall .",
    "the point where both factors equal is @xmath118 but @xmath119 will faithfully represent position of the wall only if the numbers @xmath120 and @xmath121 really are much bigger then all remaining factors .",
    "this happens when @xmath112-th wall is isolated from its neighbours , that is if @xmath122 .",
    "if for example @xmath123 is close or bigger than @xmath119 then both elementary walls are compressed with each other and located at the center of mass of the two wall system : @xmath124 this is so because ordering of masses @xmath125 implies that vacua , which are visited by the configuration along the @xmath115-axis , must be ordered as well .",
    "therefore , the elementary domain walls can not have arbitrary positions and in fact @xmath112-th wall must be placed on the right side of @xmath126-th wall .    in general , if we work out the values of all @xmath119 , @xmath127 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exes ] ) the ordering of these points tell us which walls are isolated and which are compressed .",
    "if they are ordered as @xmath128 , there are @xmath5 isolated walls located approximately at those points . in the other extreme ,",
    "if the center of mass of first @xmath129 elementary walls @xmath130 is smaller than @xmath131 , then there is only one compressed domain wall located at their mutual center of mass .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exes ] ) we see that not all @xmath104 s are necessary to describe positions of walls .",
    "we can use the symmetry transformation ( [ eq : sym1])-([eq : sym3 ] ) to reduce their number by two .",
    "let us fix this freedom and rewrite moduli @xmath104 into the standard form , where their meaning becomes more transparent : @xmath132 by virtue of this assignment @xmath133 .",
    "new parameters @xmath134 are weighted positions of the walls . since the position of the center - of - mass of the entire system is not very interesting moduli , let us fix it at @xmath135 .",
    "in other words we demand @xmath136 .",
    "this makes @xmath137 .",
    "furthermore , we will fix the remaining symmetry by demanding that @xmath138 .",
    "we will call a configuration of domain walls with center of mass fixed at origin and @xmath139 a _ balanced _ configuration .",
    "any initially unbalanced configuration of domain walls , that is @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 can be turned into a balanced one via the following transformation of the solution @xmath143 , where @xmath144      the domain wall is known to possess a three - layered structure @xcite .",
    "the outer two layers of the domain wall are customarily called the ` skin ' and here we call the inner layer the ` core ' .",
    "the skin is characterized by the rapid decay of the corresponding higgs field , from the asymptotic value @xmath145 in the vacuum outside of the domain wall to ( almost ) zero .",
    "the core is a region where all higgs fields remain very close to zero .",
    "this means that in the core the gauge symmetry is almost restored , and we can understand the skin as a transitional region from the spontaneously broken phase outside of the domain wall to the unbroken phase in the core .",
    "the core , however , is not present for all domain walls , but it develops only when the total tension is sufficiently big . let us again consider the @xmath146 example with the mass matrix @xmath147 and @xmath148 . on fig .",
    "[ fig : tensions ] we show energy density profiles of three domain walls with increasing values of total tension .",
    "the three - layered structure is most visible for the heaviest wall , where the plateau in the energy density is clearly present .",
    "the lightest wall is visibly core - less and has only skin , while the middle wall is just at the point , where core starts to develop .",
    "the existence of the core can be partially understood from the bps equations ( [ eq : bpsw1])-([eq : bpsw2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the second equation ( [ eq : bpsw2 ] ) can be seen as a condition that the value of the tension density @xmath149 can not be at any point higher than @xmath150 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : tensions ] this value is exactly 0.125 ) . notice that this upper bound can be reached only when higgs fields are zero , which is the unbroken phase .",
    "hence , if we assume that the ( maximal ) skin energy is independent of the mass ( as we will show is the case ) and that the total tension @xmath151 is significantly higher than @xmath152 , the core of the domain wall must develop , in order to store the excess energy .",
    "this observation implies that the effective radius of the core is linearly proportional to the tension , @xmath153 .",
    "in fact , ignoring skin altogether we easily estimate @xmath154 by comparing energy inside the core @xmath155 to the total energy @xmath156 , thus obtaining @xmath157 .",
    "we can gain much more insight into the structure of the domain wall by imagining very crude model as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : crudemodel ] .",
    "there , we take the higgs fields as piece - wise linear functions . outside the domain wall",
    "they are exactly fixed at given vacua ( @xmath86 on the right side an @xmath90 on the left side ) . inside the skin",
    "they linearly fall to zero across the interval of size @xmath158 and remains vanishing in the core of width @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath14 field is determined by demanding that it is a continuous function and inside every region a solution of the second bps equation ( [ eq : bpsw2 ] ) .",
    "carrying out the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bpsw2 ] ) in each region we find @xmath159    the integration constants are fixed in the following way . in the core",
    "we demand @xmath160 by reflection symmetry . in both skins",
    "we determine the integration constants by sewing the @xmath161 and @xmath162 with @xmath163 at the points @xmath164 .",
    "interestingly , remaining continuity conditions @xmath165 and @xmath166 at the points @xmath167 gives a unique relation between @xmath158 and @xmath154 in the form @xmath168 using this relation we can calculate the tension of the right skin to be @xmath169 by symmetry we have @xmath170 . combining this with the tension of the core @xmath171",
    "we see that in total we have @xmath172 , as it should be .",
    "however , not all of the energy has been accounted for .",
    "notice that at the core and in the vacua our fields are exact bps solutions , while in the skin only the second bps equation ( [ eq : bpsw2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this means that besides the tension @xmath173 there is an additional energy contribution @xmath174 coming from the violation of of the first bps equation .",
    "@xmath175 where we have used the relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) .",
    "we want this term to be as small as possible .",
    "remarkably , @xmath174 is strictly positive with a unique minimum at @xmath176 thus , using our crude model we managed to find formulas relating width of the core @xmath154 and of the skin @xmath158 to the parameters of the model as @xmath177 which are in full accordance with the previous estimates found in @xcite . as per our intuitive understanding ,",
    "the core develops only when tension of the domain wall is sufficiently big .",
    "more precisely , the crude model gives us an estimate @xmath178 , which corresponds to @xmath179 value . ] which gives slightly larger estimate @xmath180 .",
    "intuitively , closer to the actual solution the profile in the skin is , more energy is shifted from the core to the skin , giving us higher values for @xmath181 . in that sense ,",
    "the value of the crude model @xmath182 can be seen as a lower bound . ]",
    "the numerical analysis confirms that the formulas in eq .",
    "( [ eq : radii ] ) are working .",
    "for illustration , we show the comparison of the crude model with a particular numerical solution on fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] .",
    "any domain wall solution of the master equation ( [ eq : masterw ] ) is fully specified by the source term @xmath11 , which in turn depends on the mass matrix @xmath20 and on ( absolute value of ) the moduli matrix @xmath53 .",
    "however , given @xmath11 it is not possible to reconstruct @xmath20 and @xmath53 unambiguously , as we can always include any number of zero elements inside @xmath53 or degenerate entries in @xmath20 .",
    "this effectively lifts the solution to a model with an arbitrarily large number of higgs fields @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in the rest of the paper , when we specify a mass matrix @xmath20 or a moduli matrix @xmath53 we always refer to the _ minimal _ model , which can be ascertained unambiguously",
    ".    in this section , we present an infinite amount of exact solutions for the master equation ( [ eq : masterw ] ) .",
    "we do this by first presenting two new single wall solutions  or one - chains  and then we show that simple addition of these yields new multi - wall solutions  or multi - chains  provided that certain restriction on parameters holds .    the existence of such solutions might be surprising , given the non - linearity of the master equation . however , it is important to keep in mind , that for each solution the source term @xmath11 is different . to be precise ,",
    "if we link a single wall solution to an existing chain , two things happen .",
    "first , the ( minimal ) model , where the solution lives , is enlarged .",
    "if we denote the mass matrix of the @xmath183-chain as @xmath184 and a mass matrix of the link as @xmath185 , the new chain s mass matrix is given as @xmath186 , where by @xmath187 we mean all possible pairings of elements from both matrices . ] ] the moduli matrices of the chain and newly added link combine in a much more complicated fashion .",
    "second , the constraint on the parameters , which is present to ensure the validity of the solution , becomes more strict .",
    "roughly speaking , the maximum tension per individual wall is decreased . as we will argue , this tightening occurs primarily to prevent a violation of the no - go policy : @xmath188 this is the key observation of this paper .",
    "as far as we know there is no exact solution of domain wall with a core .",
    "if such solutions exist at all , they are certainly out of the reach of methods used in this paper .",
    "the search for an exact domain wall solution with a core remains an interesting open problem .",
    "another peculiarity of exact solutions presented in this paper is that there are always _ non - elementary _ walls .",
    "expect few cases , which we show in the next subsection and which were already reported elsewhere @xcite , we have found no exact solution with isolated elementary walls .",
    "in fact , the number of _ separable _ wall through the moduli parameters in the solutions themselves is always less than the number of elementary domain walls of the model . in short ,",
    "our solutions cover only subspaces of the full moduli space .    in the following two subsections , we present all one - chains , two - chains and three - chains .",
    "we will shortly discuss their properties , but we mainly focus on three characteristics : 1 ) the minimal number of flavors , 2 ) the condition that ensures their validity and 3 ) check that they have no cores . based on these particular examples , in the third subsection we provide general formulas of these characteristic for arbitrary @xmath1-chains .      in the paper @xcite three exact single wall solutions",
    "were presented . in our notation , they read @xmath189 here we have decorated each solution by the number of flavors in the superscript and by a roman numeral in the subscript for ease of reference .",
    "we have also kept the parameter @xmath190 , although @xmath191 holds for all three solutions , to keep the formulas simple .",
    "solutions ( [ eq : ex1])-([eq : ex3 ] ) are remarkable for many reasons , two of which are particularly relevant here .",
    "first , they are the only instances of exact _ elementary _ domain walls",
    ". as we stated , all other exact solutions presented in this paper are non - elementary walls .",
    "secondly , all walls are core - less , since @xmath192 .",
    "in other words , these walls are not heavy enough to have cores , as we discussed in subsection [ sec : crude ] .",
    "can we make chains out of @xmath193 , @xmath194 or @xmath195 ?",
    "in general , no .",
    "the only exception is a remarkable double wall solution also reported in @xcite , which in our notation reads @xmath196 the parameter @xmath197 can be interpreted as a separation of walls if @xmath198 , while for @xmath199 or less the walls are compressed . as",
    "already noted in @xcite , @xmath200 can be rewritten as : @xmath201 this is a first example of a two - chain .",
    "indeed , @xmath202 is a solution of a 3f model , written as a sum of two 2f domain walls and the mass matrix equals to the direct sum : @xmath203 .",
    "a peculiar feature of @xmath200 is that it is undefined for @xmath204 , which would cause @xmath68 to be complex .",
    "in fact , at @xmath205 the solution @xmath200 becomes @xmath194 , which is an elementary wall .",
    "this peculiarity , however , seems to be isolated only to this 2-chain .    with the exception of ( [ eq : pseudolin2 ] )",

    "the second exact solution is constructed similarly by relaxing mass constraint in @xmath195 : @xmath226 this solution lives in 4f model with the mass matrix @xmath227 .",

    "both our new solutions @xmath214 and @xmath231 are obviously core - less , since their are no heavier than @xmath193 and @xmath195 , respectively . but before we discuss two - chains made of @xmath214 and @xmath232 , let us introduce a simple check that given exact solution has no core . the trick is to find the maximum value of the tension density @xmath233 with all walls fixed at , say , the origin @xmath135 . since inside the core ( as discussed in subsection [ sec : crude ] ) the tension density is practically equal to @xmath234 , it is sufficient to show that @xmath235 is lower that this value .",
    "indeed , short calculation reveals that all exact single wall solutions given in this subsection have their maximal values @xmath236 markedly lower than @xmath234 .",
    "let us first investigate a two - chain made of equal tension @xmath214 walls .",

    "this can be done by inspection , but for more complicated ones , we need to establish a clear criterium .    as we saw in the example of a false two - chain made out of @xmath195 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : falsechain ] ) , the issue is that we have to guarantee that moduli matrix @xmath53 is well defined or , more simply , that all coefficients multiplying exponential factors in @xmath11 are positive numbers .",
    "these coefficients , however , are generally complicated functions of distances between walls , which makes the analysis very cumbersome . fortunately , in order to obtain a general condition for any arrangement of walls , we only need to look at the coincident case , where all walls sit on the same point on the @xmath115-axis , say the origin . at this limit ,",
    "all coefficients in @xmath11 reach their lowest values .",

    "this is intuitively understandable from the point of view of no - cores - for - exact - solutions philosophy .",
    "since the tensions of individual links in the chain add up linearly , the restriction on them must be larger , compared to restrictions on links themselves .",
    "if that were not the case , a sufficiently long chain would eventually break the threshold for developing a core . and",

    "a generic case can be characterized by partial degeneracy of the parameters @xmath105 into @xmath287 groups of size @xmath288 , where @xmath289 . within each group @xmath290",

    "let us now establish the condition under which arbitrary @xmath1-chain is a valid solution of the master equation ( [ eq : masterw ] ) .",
    "following the discussion in the previous subsection , we must investigate the lowest coefficient in @xmath11 at the coincident point .",
    "for the most general @xmath1 chain given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genericn ] ) we have @xmath295 now we extract the lowest coefficient .",

    "the closest approach is achieved by fully degenerate @xmath276 chains , that is @xmath318 and @xmath319 : @xmath320 in other words @xmath321 for @xmath322 .",
    "this might seem that for sufficiently big chains , the core should appear as the gap between @xmath235 and @xmath234 closes . however , this is misleading , because we are only looking at the height of the peak .",

    "fig : tensions ] .",
    "this clearly confirms no - core rule for exact solution , as far as chains are concerned .",
    "let us close this section by commenting on the issue of infinite chains .",
    "periodic domain wall solutions or other exact infinite wall configurations are potentially very interesting objects , worth studying on their own . however , the chains presented here can not be extended to infinite case .",
    "the obstacle can be clearly seen from the condition ( [ eq : fullcond ] ) , which implies that as @xmath324 , the parameters vanish @xmath325 .",
    "more simply , if we look again at fully degenerate @xmath276 chain as an illustrative example , we see that the amount of tension per wall decreases : @xmath326 in other words , taking @xmath1 to infinity , the chain disappears .",
    "rather than focusing on the particular type of exact solutions  like chains of the previous section  in this part we want to _ exhaust _ all exact solutions , which can be written as the logarithm of a sum of exponentials .",
    "to that goal , in the first subsection , we present a convenient ansatz , or rather a class of ansatzes .",
    "we devote later subsections to investigate first few smallest domain wall configurations as examples , highlighting the main point of this section . that it , that all exact solutions form hierarchy , where any particular solution might be seen as a special limit in parameter space of another solution , living in the larger model .",
    "unlike for chains , these relations turn out to be increasingly complicated as the minimal number of flavors of the underlying model increases .",
    "in particular , in this section we explore these relations in detail up to @xmath327 flavors .    for simplicity , throughout this section we fix the effective gauge coupling parameter @xmath328 appearing in the master equation ( [ eq : masterw3 ] ) to @xmath329 unless otherwise stated . any solution",
    "@xmath330 at unit effective gauge coupling can be rescaled to arbitrary case as @xmath331 .",

    "therefore , it is sufficient just to study strictly positive values of @xmath105 s .",
    "also , all powers of @xmath335 are automatically ordered since @xmath336 .",

    "we summarize the structure of reductions on fig .",

    "since we can not prove this statement , we regard it as a conjecture .    in this paper",
    "we have studied two subgroups of the class ( [ eq : class ] ) in detail . in the sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we have developed a concept of chains , originally spotted in @xcite .",
    "these are the solutions , which can be written as sum of single - wall solutions , or links , which we have denoted as @xmath532 and @xmath533 and their definitions can be found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : link1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : link2 ] ) .",
    "we have discussed general properties of arbitrary long chains and derived general formulas for both the number of flavors of the minimal model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nflavors ] ) and the restriction on parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullcond ] ) , which must be satisfied in order to have well - defined moduli matrix .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : grinder ] we have given a general discussion of solutions , which corresponds to taking @xmath534 limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have shown that in terms of new variables @xmath535 , these solutions can be understood as chains as well .",
    "more importantly , we have pointed out that solutions are related to each other via limits in their parameter space and thus form hierarchies .",
    "we showcased this hierarchy in detail for solutions up to @xmath385 flavors .    throughout this paper",
    ", we argued that our exact solutions have two common features .",
    "first , they are all core - less and second , they are always non - elementary .",
    "let us briefly discuss the first property .",
    "the lack of cores is intimately linked to the restriction on parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gencond ] ) .",
    "indeed , this condition is in place to ensure that the lowest coefficient in @xmath11 is never negative . at most",
    ", it can be zero , in which case remaining coefficients are positive . on the other hand ,",
    "the core can develops only when all coefficients in @xmath11 are very close to zero , since if @xmath536 the solution @xmath537 is the unbroken phase inside the core .",
    "given this observation , it is no surprise that our solutions can not develop cores .",
    "another , more heuristic reason , why our solutions are always core - less domain walls is that the functions we are working with , that is combinations of @xmath538 and @xmath539 , seems to be not sufficient to produce the shape of core - full domain walls , visualised in fig .",
    "[ fig : tensions ] .",
    "the fact that our solutions are non - elementary walls , is harder to understand .",
    "more precisely , we claim that none of the multi - wall solutions of this paper have moduli , which could isolate elementary walls . for chains of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] this is easy to see because the single - wall links of which chains are made of @xmath214 and @xmath232 are non - elementary walls from the beginning . to confirm the same for the broadest class of solutions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : class ] ) is much harder to do in general . intuitively , however , given that the constraint ( [ eq : gencond ] ) makes any generic multi - wall configuration lighter than the lightest exact elementary wall @xmath193 , it is natural to conclude that our solutions are all non - elementary . despite this observation ,",
    "the very fact that exact description of elementary walls seems to be much more difficult task than a description of compressed ones remains very puzzling .    in light of these findings ,",
    "we are left with two challenges : first , is to find solutions for walls with well - developed cores and second , is to understand the disproportion between the number of exact elementary domain walls  which are three : @xmath193 , @xmath193 and @xmath540  and the number of exact compressed domain walls  which is potentially unlimited if the number of higgs fields @xmath0 is arbitrarily large .    in closing ,",
    "let us briefly comment about the impact of our findings to other topological solitons .",
    "the most direct implications can be made for composite solitons containing domain walls , such as wall - wall junctions and wall - vortex junctions .",
    "the reason is that their master equations include eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterw ] ) as a subset , which hints that similar richness of exact solutions found for domain walls could be found there as well .",
    "our preliminary results strongly favor this possibility and we plan to explore this fully in a future study .",
    "another straightforward implication is that multi - flavor _ non_-abelian domain walls ( studied in @xcite ) should possess a large number of exact solutions too .",
    "this can be seen easily by acknowledging the fact that solutions in abelian model can be embedded into a non - abelian case .",
    "more precisely , for a class of so - called @xmath12-factorizable solutions , the non - abelian analog of the master equation can be shown to decompose into a direct sum of independent abelian master equations .",
    "therefore any solution presented here can be used to construct a @xmath12-factorizable solutions in a non - abelian model .",
    "the question whether our approach can help to find exact solutions which are not @xmath12-factorizable provides another interesting direction for future work .",
    "lastly , an indirect implication of our results is that it raises expectations about number and abundance of exact solutions in _ any _ master equation .",
    "in particular , in the paper @xcite f.b . and others found several new exact solutions of semi - local vortices , hinting a very rich structure of exact solutions there . we plan to elaborate on these findings in the future .",
