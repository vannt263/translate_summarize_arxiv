    "<S> we consider the random matrix ensemble with an external source @xmath0 defined on @xmath1 hermitian matrices , where @xmath2 is a diagonal matrix with only two eigenvalues @xmath3 of equal multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> for the case @xmath4 , we establish the universal behavior of local eigenvalue correlations in the limit @xmath5 , which is known from unitarily invariant random matrix models . </S>",
    "<S> thus , local eigenvalue correlations are expressed in terms of the sine kernel in the bulk and in terms of the airy kernel at the edge of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we use a characterization of the associated multiple hermite polynomials by a @xmath6-matrix riemann - hilbert problem , and the deift / zhou steepest descent method to analyze the riemann - hilbert problem in the large @xmath7 limit . </S>"
