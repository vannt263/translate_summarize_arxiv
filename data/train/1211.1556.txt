    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) nanomaterials , such as graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) , are expected to play a key role in future nanotechnology as well as to provide potential applications in next - generation electronics .",
    "recently , novel hybrid structures consisting of a patchwork of bn and c nanodomains ( bnc ) was synthesized through the use of a thermal catalytic chemical vapour deposition method @xcite .",
    "this finding immediately has attracted a great deal of research interest @xcite , given it demonstrating a hitherto efficient route to tune the band gaps of these 2d materials .",
    "it is well known that the perfect hexagonal and planar structure of bnc largely depends on the well matching between bn and c domains .",
    "however , it is indeed an outstanding challenge as bn and c phases are naturally immiscible in 2d @xcite .",
    "this explains why ci _",
    "_ @xcite could observe some wrinkles in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) image .",
    "such mutual contradiction mainly originates from the domain boundary effect and the staggered potentials of b and n atoms in bnc , which doubtlessly affects their continuous tunable electronic energy gaps .",
    "it has been confirmed in the related theoretical calculations @xcite where the band gaps behave a strong oscillation feature .",
    "the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) of bnc measured in the work from ci _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows two additional types of c bonding configurations , which correspond to the c - b and c - n bonds with the bonding energies of around 188.4 and 398.1 ev , respectively .",
    "this feature means that two inequivalent c bonding types , i.e. , c - b or c - n bonds , must be present in the boundaries of the hybridized bn and c domains , which have a significant effect on determining the local structures and subsequently vary the electronic properties in this system .",
    "for example , the transport channels behave a robust characteristic gap when the topological index changes sign of the valley hall effect @xcite . in addition",
    ", both raman d band at 1,360 @xmath2 and d@xmath3 band at 1,620 @xmath2 are also observed in bnc @xcite , which were attributed to the lattice disorder or the finite crystal size .",
    "this lattice disorder effect might directly introduce vacancies to these 2d hexagonal system @xcite , which is also true in bnc as shown in fig .",
    "2a of ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the planar bnc structure ,",
    "although the larger domains would be preferred to decrease the total domain interfacial energy , the randomly distributed hybrid domains , the immiscible phases as well as the induced vacancies must result in various complex structures of bnc @xcite . as an immediate consequence is the largely inaccessible synthesis of expected bnc in experiments @xcite , which next hinders realization of bandgap - engineered applications in actual devices . in this endeavour ,",
    "exploring the structures and electronic properties associated with c bonds formation in bnc that contain c - n or c - b bonds is an interesting topic that must be addressed before widespread synthetic applications .",
    "thus , a simple model of bnc where the c bonds play a crucial role must be considered again .",
    "more importantly , a deep theoretical understanding , which originally was concealed behind the complex hybridized structures , is imperative .     for @xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c .",
    "yellow , green , and gray balls represent b , n , and c atoms , respectively .",
    "their respective 2@xmath42 supercells are also given nearby . , width=377 ]    here we report such a simple model of bnc may be just the graphitic b@xmath1n@xmath1c ( @xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c ) , which is a perfect 2d monolayer graphite - like structure as shown in fig .",
    "as mentioned above , c atom can bond to b and n atoms .",
    "therefore , two topological types of @xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c are easily deduced .",
    "one is the @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c related to the the higher bonding energy of c - n bond , while the other one is the @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c constructed based on the lower bonding energy of c - b bond .",
    "it can be seen that such a material is essentially c - doped graphitic bn ( g - bn ) with vacancies @xcite . the substitution of the n / b atom with a c atom in g - bn with the b / n vacancy will yield the @xmath7-g - b@xmath1n@xmath1c structure .",
    "the interactions among the c atoms and/or vacancies as well as the c bonding types ( c - b and c - n bonds ) in @xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c significantly alter its electronic properties . to explore this effect , standard density functional theory with different functionals ( see the following discussion ) calculations have been carried out for this predicted material",
    ". remarkably , such material displays two distinct electronic structure properties : @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c is a semiconductor , while @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c behaves metallic and leads to a magnetic ground state .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in the second section , we present the computational method used in this work , followed by electronic band gap in @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c and magnetism in @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c in the third section .",
    "we then conclude this paper in the fourth section .",
    "for structural optimization , we employed density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential within the projector augmented wave method as implemented in vasp @xcite .",
    "an all - electron description , the projector augmented wave method , is used to describe the electron - ion interaction .",
    "the cutoff energy for plane waves is set to be 500 ev , and the vacuum space is at least 15  , which is large enough to avoid the interaction between periodical images .",
    "a 7@xmath47@xmath41 monkhorst - pack grid is used for the sampling of the brillouin zone during geometry optimization .",
    "all the atoms in the unit cell were allowed to relax , and the convergence of force is set to 0.01 ev /  . additionally , spin polarization is turned on during the relaxation processes .",
    "all other calculations of accurate electronic properties were performed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) @xcite method as implemented in the wien2k code @xcite .",
    "it is well known that different xc potentials can lead , depending on the studied materials and properties , to results which are in very bad agreement with experiment , e.g. , for the band gap of semiconductors and insulators which is severely underestimated or even absent @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the modified becke and johnson ( mbj ) @xcite potential in the framework of local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite is taken to calculate the band gap of @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c , while the magnetism in @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c is described by the pbe ( the standard gga for materials ) potential .",
    "figure 1 plots the total energy per atom against the lattice constant @xmath8 ( the lattice constant @xmath9 is fixed ) for @xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c .",
    "it can be seen that the total energy of @xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c as a function of lattice constant @xmath8 has a single minimum , meaning that the geometrical structure would be stable .",
    "particularly , the charge population analysis reveals that the electron density around the c - n bond in @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c is much higher than that on the c - b bond in @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c , showing that the c - n bond is relatively strong , which is also consistent with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "this strong interaction between c and n atoms in @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c directly results in a short c - n bond length ( see following ) , and can balance the strain of the monolayer graphite - like structure .",
    "thereby @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c could be a more thermodynamically stable topological phase against @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c , which has a lower total energy of around 0.43 ev / atom compared with @xmath6-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c .",

    "the relative band gap correction from mbj with respect to lda , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the band gap , is about 32% .",
    "we can see that our calculated @xmath12 for @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c ( shows an excellent agreement with the 16 _ sp _ semiconductors ) lies within the range 16.0%-100.0% ( see table 1 for details ) .",
    "the correction value is particularly very close to that in bn ( 25% ) , gan ( 42% ) , alp ( 37% ) , and aln ( 25% ) .",

    "this feature can be attributed to the even distribution of c atoms in @xmath5-@xmath0-b@xmath1n@xmath1c as mentioned above , which behaves a different formation mechanism compared with the hybrid bnc in experiment @xcite .",
    "correction effects were taken into account by adding a lda correction potential in mbj @xcite .",
    "this important physical effect opens an additional band gap through mimicing very well the behavior of orbital - dependent potentials and causes a rigid blueshift of the absorption spectrum compared with the lda / pbe curves as shown in fig .",
