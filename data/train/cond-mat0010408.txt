    "adsorbate - adsorbate interactions at surfaces play a key role in controlling the structure and properties of interfacial materials .",
    "such interactions can be classified as through - space ( direct ) or through - substrate ( indirect ) , although a clear distinction is not possible  @xcite .",
    "quantification of the indirect , substrate - mediated interaction between two adsorbates is the primary subject of this paper .",
    "substrate - mediated interactions can have an elastic and an electronic component .",
    "elastic interactions arise when an adsorbed atom perturbs the positions of surrounding surface atoms  @xcite . additionally , an adsorbate may perturb the charge density near the surface and alter the binding energies of neighboring adsorbates - giving rise to an electronic interaction  @xcite .",
    "the electronic interaction is oscillatory in nature and , in the limit that the separation @xmath0 between two adsorbates is much greater than the inverse fermi wavevector @xmath1 , the interaction energy @xmath2 is predicted  @xcite to have the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 if the substrate has a surface state and @xmath5 in the absence of a surface state .",
    "oscillatory , charge - density waves associated with the electronic interaction have been imaged in scanning - tunneling microscopy ( stm ) studies of noble - metal surfaces  @xcite , which posses a surface state .",
    "for example , on ag(111 ) , @xmath6   @xcite and charge density waves can be imaged at distances greater than 70   @xcite in stm studies .",
    "electronic , substrate - mediated interactions should also be manifested at `` intermediate '' distances between the short separations required for chemical bonds and the long separations for which eq .",
    "[ eq - de - asymp ] is applicable .",
    "for example , einstein and schrieffer showed in tight - binding calculations that the intermediate - range interaction is present and is , in fact , more significant than the long - range interaction  @xcite .",
    "recent , low - temperature stm studies also indicate that this is the case  @xcite for cu adatoms on cu(111 ) .",
    "the intermediate range is accessible to modern , electronic - structure calculations . in this study , we use density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations to quantify the substrate - mediated interaction between two adatoms on a ( compressively ) strained and on an unstrained ag(111 ) surface .",
    "we discuss the ramifications of these interactions for adsorbate diffusion and growth at surfaces .",
    "total energies and forces are calculated using the dft code described by bockstedte _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , employing fully separable , norm - conserving pseudo - potentials of the kleinman - bylander form  @xcite .",
    "these were generated using the code developed by fuchs and scheffler  @xcite .",
    "for our calculations with ag , the @xmath7 pseudopotential component is taken as local and we use @xmath8 and @xmath0 projectors .",
    "the @xmath9-electrons are taken as valence states and their wave functions are expanded in plane waves , which truncate at a cut - off energy of @xmath10 ry for our calculations .",
    "we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the supercell approach is used to describe the surface . for most results presented here ,",
    "the surface is modeled as a repeating @xmath11 slab with 16 atoms per unit cell and a thickness of four layers .",
    "the vacuum spacing is five interlayer distances , or @xmath12 12 .",
    "adsorbed atoms are placed on one side of the slab and field effects due to the asymmetry are correctly treated in the code by a compensating dipole field .",
    "for some of the adsorbate interactions probed , it is expedient to utilize smaller slabs .",
    "thus , we also use four - layer @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 slabs for some of the calculations . for all of the main results presented here ,",
    "the @xmath16-space integration is performed with the equivalent of 4 special @xmath16 points in the full , surface brillouin zone of the @xmath11 slab . to improve @xmath16-space integration , the electronic states are occupied according to a fermi distribution with @xmath17=0.1 ev and",
    "the total energies are extrapolated to zero temperature .    to verify the accuracy of the pseudo - potential , we calculated the lattice constant of bulk ag in its ground state .",
    "for these calculations , we use @xmath10 ry and 182 @xmath16 points in the irreducible portion of the brillouin zone .",
    "we find a lattice constant of @xmath18 , which is within 1 % of the values found by yu and scheffler  @xcite and by ratsch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who both used dft with the gga functional of perdew _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . as an additional test of the accuracy , we calculated the interlayer relaxation @xmath19 of the first layer of ag(111 ) .",
    "for these calculations , the first layer atoms are relaxed until the forces on them are less than 0.005 ev /  .",
    "we find that the first layer relaxes inward by 2.0 % relative to the bulk , interlayer spacing @xmath20 , in good agreement with dft local - density approximation ( lda ) results by narasimhan and scheffler  @xcite , who found an inward relaxation of 1.7% , and by xie , _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who found an inward relaxation of 1.0 % .",
    "medium - energy ion scattering experiments indicate that @xmath19 contracts by  2.5 % relative to @xmath20 at temperatures below 670 k  @xcite .",
    "a more recent low - energy electron diffraction investigation indicates no contraction of @xmath19 occurs on this surface  @xcite . in previous theoretical studies of ag(111 )  @xcite , it was found that differences between @xmath21 and @xmath20 are negligible .",
    "thus , in the calculations presented here , @xmath21 is fixed to @xmath20 .",
    "we study adsorbate interactions on both ag(111 ) and on a strained ag(111 ) surface .",
    "for the strained ag(111 ) surface , we employ a bulk lattice constant of 4.01  .",
    "this value is taken from the results of dft - gga calculations of the lattice constant of pt by ratsch , seitsonen and scheffler  @xcite .",
    "we choose this substrate to address experimental issues related to ag epitaxy on a pt(111 ) substrate covered by a monolayer ( ml ) of ag  @xcite . to describe the bare , strained ag(111 ) substrate , the top layer of atoms is relaxed and the rest are fixed to the strained , bulk positions .",
    "this results in an outward relaxation of the top layer by 9.0 % relative to @xmath20 for the strained substrate .",
    "the outward relaxation allows for relief of the strain induced by the bulk lattice , which is compressed by 4.61% relative to bulk ag , as it is described by our dft calculations with the gga .",
    "the total interaction energy @xmath2 for a periodic slab containing @xmath22 adatoms , of which @xmath23 are at binding site @xmath24 and @xmath25 are at binding site @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the total energy of a slab with @xmath22 adatoms , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the total energies of slabs containing one adatom , and @xmath31 is the total energy of a bare slab .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 from the calculations described above . in an attempt to isolate the electronic component of @xmath2",
    ", we obtain @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 as follows : a single atom is placed in a binding site ( an fcc or hcp three - fold hollow site ) on a relaxed ( as described above ) bare slab and its height is optimized with respect to the fixed substrate .",
    "> from this calculation , we obtain @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "to calculate @xmath28 , adatoms are placed in binding sites on the relaxed ( and fixed ) substrate with heights fixed to values from the single - adatom calculations .",
    "we use this procedure to obtain most of the results described below .",
    "additionally , to resolve the elastic contribution to @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 by simultaneously relaxing the adatoms and the first - layer substrate atoms for a few trial configurations .    in the dft supercell approach ,",
    "the total interaction energy @xmath2 is comprised of interactions between different adatoms in the slab and interactions between adatoms in the slab and the periodic - image adatoms .",
    "we can express @xmath2 in terms of these interactions using the lattice - gas hamiltonian approach ( see , _",
    "e.g._@xcite ) , which yields    @xmath32    here , the summations run over all sites @xmath33 in the slab and all sites @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the supercell ( which includes both the slab and its periodic images ) , @xmath36 is unity if site @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is occupied and zero , otherwise , @xmath39 is the distance between sites @xmath37 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the pair interaction between two adatoms on sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath42 is the trio interaction between three adatoms on sites @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we neglect higher - order interactions . another assumption implicit in eq .",
    "[ eq - lattice - gas ] is that the interaction between adatoms at a fixed distance is independent of whether these atoms occupy fcc or hcp sites .",
    "actually , in the results presented below , interactions between two adatoms occupying the same type of binding site are always obtained for adatoms on fcc sites .",
    "we performed one test of this assumption for two adatoms on hcp sites .",
    "this calculation showed that the interaction was identical to that found for atoms on fcc sites .",
    "finally , in calculations designed to resolve the electronic interaction ( which comprise the bulk of the results presented here ) , the adatom binding energies on fcc and hcp sites are virtually equal : the fcc site is favored by less than 3 mev .",
    "= 9.7 cm    to illustrate our approach , we show one of the structures probed in our calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig - lgh ] . in this structure ,",
    "two adatoms are in the @xmath11 surface unit cell at a separation of 3.43    ( distance 2 , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig - pair ] below ) .",
    "each of these adatoms has two , neighboring , periodic - image adatoms at a distance of 9.08    ( distance 12 shown on fig .",
    "[ fig - pair ] below ) . from eq .",
    "[ eq - lattice - gas ] , @xmath2 for this configuration is comprised of one pair interaction at distance 2 and two at distance 12 .",
    "thus , for a given adatom configuration , we express @xmath43 as a sum of pair and trio interactions with unknown coefficients . from 13 different configurations ,",
    "we obtain a system of linear equations and solve these for pair - interaction coefficients up to the @xmath44-neighbor .",
    "we assume that all other interaction coefficients are zero .",
    "before proceeding to our results , we discuss our tests of their accuracy .",
    "we test the convergence of our results with respect to @xmath45 , the number of @xmath16 points , the slab thickness , and the exchange - correlation functional for different adsorbate configurations on ag(111 ) and strained ag(111 ) .",
    "the adsorbate configurations in these tests are chosen for two major reasons .",
    "first , for each configuration , the total interaction energy is composed of interactions at a single , adsorbate - pair distance .",
    "thus , it is possible to extract pair interactions without solution of the full system of equations for the lattice - gas hamiltonian .",
    "a second reason for choosing these configurations is that they posses a single mirror plane - the highest symmetry that could be achieved here .",
    "the ( relatively ) high symmetry makes it possible to retain up to 16 @xmath46 points in the full surface brillouin zone of a @xmath11 unit cell , so that we can assess the convergence of the @xmath16-point summations for these configurations . for configurations of lower symmetry , 4 @xmath16-points in the @xmath11 unit cell",
    "is the maximum that we could use with the computational resources available to us . in table 1",
    "we show the influence of the cut - off energy , the slab thickness , and the number of @xmath16 points on three , pair - interaction coefficients for ag adatoms on ag(111 ) .",
    "the distances for the pair interactions can be seen below in fig .",
    "[ fig - pair ] . for each result in table 1 , each of the three energies necessary to obtain the pair - interaction coefficient ( cf . , eq .",
    "[ eq - de ] ) is obtained with the indicated cut - off energy , slab thickness , and number of @xmath16 points .",
    ".convergence tests for @xmath47 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     adsorbate interactions at surfaces can influence both thermodynamically favored structures and adsorbate diffusion . to assess the impact of adsorbate interactions on surface diffusion , we obtain the diffusion barrier for an isolated adatom to hop between adjacent three - fold hollow sites on both surfaces . in these calculations , both the adatom and the surface atoms are relaxed .",
    "the diffusion barrier is given by the difference between the total energy when the adatom is at a bridge site and when the atom is at a fcc three - fold hollow site .",
    "we find for ag(111 ) that the diffusion barrier is 87 mev . for strained ag(111 )",
    ", we find a barrier of 52 mev .",
    "our barriers are in good agreement with those of ratsch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who found 81 mev for ag(111 ) and 63 mev for strained ag(111 ) in dft - lda calculations .",
    "differences between the barriers that we find and those found by ratsch can be attributed to differences in the exchange - correlation functional ( lda vs. the gga used here ) .",
    "additionally , there are differences between the lattice constant predicted for the strained ag(111 ) surface in the two studies . as discussed above",
    ", the lattice in our gga calculations is compressively strained by 4.61 % relative to the bulk , while the strain for the lda system is 3.21 % .",
    "_ found that the value of the diffusion barrier on a strained ag(111 ) surface is very sensitive to the degree to which the surface is strained and that smaller diffusion barriers arise on surfaces under greater compression  @xcite .",
    "the difference between our diffusion barrier and that found by ratsch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is adherent to this trend .",
    "our diffusion barriers are also in good agreement with experimental values  @xcite for ag on 1-ml - ag / pt(111 ) ( 60 mev ) and on ag(111 ) ( 97 mev ) .    comparing the diffusion barrier for an adatom on strained ag(111 ) to the magnitude of the pair interactions on this surface",
    ", we see that the two are comparable .",
    "thus , one conclusion arising from this work is that substrate - mediated interactions can influence adsorbate diffusion and morphologies formed during growth at surfaces .",
    "our recent kinetic monte carlo simulation studies of island nucleation and growth show that this is the case  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental stm studies have begun to probe the role of adsorbate lateral interactions in determining the structure of adsorbate islands at surfaces  @xcite .",
