    "for a long time the generalized bohr hamiltonian ( gbh ) [ 1 - 3 ] was used to describe the low lying quadrupole collective excitations in nuclei .",
    "especially the bohr hamiltonian with the collective inertial functions and potential evaluated microscopically ( see e.g. [ 2,3 ] ) was attractive as a model containing no free parameters .",
    "unfortunately confrontation of theoretical predictions of such a model with the experimental data leads to the conclusion that the microscopic inertial functions , i.e. mass parameters and moments of inertia , are too small .",
    "one has to magnify them 2 to 3 times in order to obtain the collective energy levels in right positions [ 2 ] . in paper",
    "[ 3 ] it was suggested that the pairing correlations in the collective excited states are weaker than in the ground state .",
    "this effect could explain the growth of the inertial functions .",
    "it was shown in ref . [ 3 ] that decrease of the pairing strength by only 17% could increase the magnitude of the mass parameters by a factor 2 to 3 and in consequence obtain the energies of collective levels relatively close to the experimental data .",
    "a nice explanation of the origin of the decrease of the pairing correlations in the collective excited states offers the collective pairing hamiltonian first introduced by bs and coworkers in ref . [ 4 ] for the two  levels model and than elaborated in [ 5 ] for a more realistic case .",
    "it was shown in [ 5 ] that the growth of the mass parameter with decreasing pairing gap ( @xmath0 ) produces a significant collective effect , namely that the most probable @xmath0 is smaller than that obtained from the bcs solution .",
    "the coupling of the collective pairing vibrations with the collective quadrupole excitations was discussed in ref . [ 6 ] for the axially symmetric case .",
    "the spectrum of collective levels obtained in the model with the coupling was almost twice compressed in comparison with the spectrum given by the bohr hamiltonian which does not contain the coupling with pairing vibrations .",
    "encouraging by the results obtained in [ 6 ] we have modify in refs . [",
    "7,8 ] the generalized bohr hamiltonian taking into account the major effect of the coupling with the pairing vibrations .",
    "namely , we have evaluated ( in each @xmath1 point ) all inertial functions for the most probable @xmath0 not for that which corresponds to the bcs minimum .    in the present paper we are going to describe briefly our model and present some typical results for the neutron ",
    "rich isotopes of pd and ru and the neutron ",
    "deficient isotopes of te , ba and nd .",
    "these examples illustrate well , how does work the model for transitional nuclei .",
    "it is rather difficult to solve the nine dimensional eigenproblem of the full collective hamiltonian containing quadrupole and pairing vibrations for neutrons and protons . but assuming that the coupling between quadrupole and pairing variables is weak one can neglect mixing terms and obtain an approximate solution .",
    "such approximate collective hamiltonian consists of two known terms and an operator @xmath2 which mix quadrupole and pairing variables : @xmath3 the last term will be neglected in further calculations .",
    "the operator @xmath4 describes quadrupole oscillations and rotations of a nucleus and it takes the form of the generalized bohr hamiltonian [ 2,3 ] : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the collective potential , the kinetic vibrational energy reads @xmath7 + & & \\\\",

    "the mass parameters ( or vibrational inertial functions ) @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 together with moments of inertia @xmath15 depend on intrinsic variables @xmath16 and pairing gap values @xmath17 .",
    "all inertial functions are determined from a microscopic theory .",
    "we apply the standard cranking method to evaluate the inertial functions assuming that the nucleus is a system of nucleons moving in the deformed mean field ( nilsson potential ) and interacting through monopole pairing forces .",
    "one has to stress that for @xmath0 corresponding to the minimum of the bcs energy the operator @xmath4 is exactly the same as the bohr hamiltonian used in ref .",

    "one can find the pairing vibrational ground - state wave function @xmath29 and the ground - energy @xmath30 at each deformation point .",
    "the most probable value of the energy gap @xmath31 corresponds to the maximum of the probability of finding a given gap value in the collective pairing ground - state ( namely the maximum of the function @xmath32 ) . as it is shown in fig .  1 the @xmath31",
    "is shifted towards smaller gaps from the equilibrium point @xmath33 determined by the minimum of @xmath34 ( or by the bcs formalism ) .",
    "such a behavior of the pairing ground state function @xmath29 is due to the rapid increase of pairing mass parameter @xmath35 .",

    "the collective potential corresponds to the ground state of the @xmath38 hamiltonian ( 5 ) and it is very close to the bcs energy in each @xmath1 point .",
    "the approximation described above is rather crude but it includes the main effect ( at least on average ) of the coupling with the pairing vibrational mode .",
    "this procedure improves significantly the accuracy in reproducing the experimental data and it introduces no additional parameters into the model .",
    "our calculations were done using the standard nilsson single particle potential with the shell dependent parametrization found in ref . [ 9 ] . the pairing strength was fitted in refs .",

    "we present here only some examples of results for the neutron ",

    "2 the improvement in reproducing the experimental data caused by coupling with the pairing vibrations is really significant .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the theoretical ( open symbols ) and experimental ( full symbols ) energy levels of the ground state band and the @xmath39 band for the even  even isotopes of ru and pd with @xmath40 neutrons .",

    "it is seen that a good agreement is obtained for the nd nuclei and for the lightest te and ba isotopes only .",
    "the electromagnetic transitions between the band members and between the states belonging to different bands are also relatively well reproduced by our model ( see refs . [ 7,8 ] ) .",

    "the collective potential and inertial functions are determined by means of the strutinsky method and the cranking model , respectively .",
    "a shell - dependent parametrization of the nilsson potential is used .",
    "there are no adjustable parameters in the calculation .",
    "the coupling of the quadrupole and pairing vibrations [ 5 - 6 ] is taken into account and it brings the energy levels down to the scale comparable with that characteristic for the experimental levels [ 6 ] .    in the neutron  reach region we have performed calculations for chains of isotopes of ru and pd . in this case",
    "theoretical estimates of energies of low lying collective states and electromagnetic transitions within bands , as well as between members of different bands , are even closer to experimental data than for nuclei from the neutron - deficient region . in the region of neutron ",
    "deficient nuclei the gbh works better in the case of elements with larger @xmath18 , namely , ce , nd and sm than for xe , ba and te which have only two protons outside the closed shell @xmath41 .",
    "energies are especially well reproduced by the calculation for isotopes with lower number of neutrons . for those with neutron number",
    "@xmath42 the energy levels are , as a rule , too high . on the contrary ,",
    "electromagnetic properties seem to be better reproduced just in the case of heavier isotopes .",
    "concluding , we may say that adding of the coupling with the pairing vibrations to the generalized bohr hamiltonian improves significantly the quality of theoretical estimates for nuclei from the both regions .",
