    "the mechanism by which globular clusters ( gcs ) are destroyed has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "these studies include intrinsic processes like cluster evaporation , as well as environmental influences such as dynamical friction and tidal shocking from disks , bulges and supermassive black holes .",
    "recently , gnedin and ostriker ( 1997 ) considered the effect of these processes on the present and , by extrapolation , on the initial population of gcs in the milky way .",
    "the conclusion they drew is that between 52% and 86% of the current population of gcs in our galaxy will be eventually destroyed by the combination of evaporation , dynamical friction and tidal shocking over the next hubble time .",
    "they added that the initial population of gcs was likely to be substantially larger than the present one , with the clusters that pass closest to the galactic center subject to destruction by bulge shocking .",
    "moreover , the remnant stars join the bulge and the halo of the galaxy , perhaps making a dominant contribution to their stellar populations .",
    "murali and weinberg ( 1997a ) reached similar conclusions ( i.e. a factor of two decrease in the initial population ) considering the global evolution of the populations of milky way disk and halo clusters .",
    "observationally , the distributions of gc shapes have been studied in the milky way @xcite and in nearby galaxies such as m31 @xcite , the lmc @xcite , and the smc @xcite .",
    "a comparison of gcs in the milky way and m31 @xcite shows that both galaxies have similar , nearly spherical distributions of clusters , with axial ratios peaked respectively at @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the other hand , gcs in the lmc and smc",
    "differ significantly .",
    "globulars in these galaxies require triaxial parameters to describe their shapes . the distribution of axial ratios of gcs in the lmc peaks at about @xmath4 and that of the smc , at @xmath5 .",
    "han and ryden ( 1994 ) explain this situation by a gradual decay of velocity anisotropy as a consequence of two body relaxation , so that the older clusters in the milky way and m31 are now supported mainly by rotation .",
    "however , goodwin ( 1997 ) argues that there is no age / ellipticity relationship for gcs , and that in fact the stronger tidal field in larger galaxies is the dominant effect in producing the observed differences .",
    "severe observed distortions in the globulars of giant galaxies are rare , but axial ratio values as low as @xmath6 have been measured for gcs in the galaxy .",
    "also , the discovery of populations of young gcs in various interacting galaxies opens a new laboratory for the study of destruction mechanisms @xcite . for external galaxies and for the milky way observations of distortion",
    "typically involve measurement of ellipticity at the half mass radius of the gc , but it is also known that the shape changes with distance from cluster center .",
    "theoretical inferences about the destruction of gcs have mostly been considered from the statistical point of view . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we instead considered how the destruction event itself proceeds .",
    "there we reported the outcome of a series of @xmath7body numerical simulations of a single gc under the influence of the gravitational potential of a galactic bulge and/or supermassive black hole .",
    "disk shocking also plays an important role , however , in the inner parts of galaxies it is the central spheroid that dominates @xcite . in our previous paper , we concentrated on computing the mass lost by the gc as a function of the distance of closest approach , the bulge concentration , and the mass of the black hole .",
    "a gc venturing within a distance of a few hundred pc of the galactic center was completely destroyed in a single passage .",
    "however , it is expected that these ultra - close encounters are relatively rare .",
    "more typically , the orbit of a gc would pass through a range of perigalactic distances for which only a small fraction of the stars become unbound . in these types of encounters",
    ", the gc would be noticeably distorted by tidal forces , but would not be totally destroyed until at least several passages had taken place .",
    "many of the clusters on orbits that venture close to the bulge were destroyed billions of years ago , however as the gc system evolves there will be some clusters that reach closer and closer passages .",
    "several galactic clusters are presently found within 12  kpc of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to characterize the distortions induced in a gc by its interaction with a galactic bulge .",
    "for some cases the effect of a supermassive black hole is also considered .",
    "of particular interest is the feasibility of finding direct observational evidence of the destruction of gcs , both in the milky way and in external galaxies .",
    "grillmair et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have determined by star count analysis that most of the twelve galactic globular clusters in their sample have some degree of distortion of their surface density contours .",
    "they suggest that this is the effect of tidal stripping of loosely bound stars by the gravitational potential of the galaxy .    as with our previous work ,",
    "we base the present study on @xmath7body simulations that are designed both to quantify the nature of the distortions of gcs produced specifically by bulge shocking and to explore the region of parameter space in which such distortions occur . with our simulations",
    ", it is possible to address past and present distortions in the milky way and to consider implications in external galaxies of various types .",
    "specifically , we ask : 1 ) under which circumstances do clusters change shape due to bulge shocking ?",
    ", 2 ) what is the detailed physical mechanism that gives rise to shape distortions and how can we characterize them ? , 3 ) can these distortions feasibly be observed in the milky way , and are the present constraints consistent with the properties of the milky way bulge and gc population ?",
    ", 4 ) where and when are bulge shocking distortions most easily observed ? , and 5 ) how long do distortions persist and what is the fate of these distorted globulars ?",
    "the main challenge in a numerical study aimed at characterizing shape distortions of gcs is to achieve a satisfactory level of resolution .",
    "typical gc deformations often only involve the outer layers of the cluster .",
    "thus , in order to obtain reasonable observational predictions on shapes of gcs from @xmath7body simulations , it is important to model gcs ( systems of @xmath8 stars ) with at least @xmath9 particles",
    ". this lower bound on the number of particles is necessary because gcs are highly concentrated objects , requiring a large investment of computational resources to simultaneously resolve their cores as well as their outer layers .",
    "these days , @xmath7body simulations with @xmath10 particles are not considered extremely demanding ; however , it is important to utilize a code fast enough that parameter space searches are feasible .",
    "we use an @xmath7body , parallel , oct  tree code for this purpose @xcite . with this code",
    ", it is possible to carry out selected runs with each star in the gc represented by its own particle , and , at the same time , the code s performance allows the exploration of substantial region of parameter space .",
    "the code does not include the effects of two  body relaxation , but it should not be important for the single passages through the bulge .    much of the previous work on the evolution of gcs has been based upon solution of the fokker ",
    "planck equation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "clearly , this technique is convenient for considering the statistical evolution of the initial milky way gc population , including both internal ( stellar evolution ) and external ( tidal ) effects .",
    "however , recent work by zwart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) questions the general applicability of this technique by comparing to an n  body approach , considering the effects of close encounters .",
    "for some cluster parameters and initial conditions the fokker ",
    "planck technique yields gc lifetimes a factor of ten smaller .",
    "this issue remains open for debate , however , since our goal in this paper is to focus on observability of gc distortions due to bulge shocking during a single passage , an n  body approach is more appropriate regardless .",
    "a gc experiences forces due to the other stars in the cluster and due to all the other material in its host galaxy .",
    "we model the _ background _ force of the galaxy by an analytic potential .",
    "a crucial question for this study was the choice of bulge potentials .",
    "there is convincing evidence in favor of triaxial bulges in the milky way and in other galaxies @xcite . near ",
    "infrared observations from cobe dirbe support a galactic bulge resembling a prolate spheroid with 1:0.33:0.23 axis ratios @xcite .",
    "orbits of gcs in triaxial potentials can certainly be quite different from those with spherical symmetry ( e.g. box orbits ) .",
    "for that reason , initially we considered triaxial potentials such as the schwarzschild triaxial potential @xcite .",
    "however , we found that for a single passage with perigalactic distance @xmath1pc , there was no significant difference in the nature and shape of the deformations between triaxial and spherical potentials as long as both potentials were comparable in depth and in extent ( see below ) .",
    "as a consequence , information about the triaxiality of the bulge can only be extracted from study of gc shape distortions in a statistical sense , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .    based on the above observations and in order to directly compare with our previous work , we have chosen to model the bulge using the hernquist potential @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the mass of the bulge , and @xmath14 is a scale length related to the half - mass radius @xmath15 .",
    "we considered values of @xmath16  pc and @xmath17  pc .",
    "this represents a range typical of the bulges of spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , the mass of the bulge was taken to be @xmath18 or @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass of the gc ( results are presented in units of @xmath20 ) .",
    "these bulge masses are consistent with a typical gc mass of @xmath21m@xmath22 if the bulge has a mass of @xmath23m@xmath22 or @xmath24m@xmath22 , respectively .    the tidal force on a star that is on a line joining the centers of the bulge and",
    "the gc is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance between the bulge and the gc , and @xmath27 is the distance from the star to the center of the gc .",
    "notice that at a fixed separation @xmath26 , the strength of this force decreases as @xmath14 increases .",
    "one can find an estimate of the tidal radius , @xmath28 , by equating expression ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) to the restoring force from the gc itself .",
    "this yields @xmath29 a gc will undergo tidal deformations if @xmath30 . since observations suggest that @xmath31pc and since we are not interested in ultra - close encounters ( i.e. , we consider only @xmath1pc ) , one has from ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) that the region in the gc subject to distortions is @xmath32 pc .",
    "typical core radii of gcs lie between 0.3 and 10 pc @xcite , thus it is only the _ halo _ of the gc that gets distorted .    to understand the role that triaxiality plays in producing tidal deformations , let us extend the hernquist potential ( [ eq:1 ] ) to a triaxial form by defining @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 as parameters .",
    "the tidal force along the @xmath37-axis is @xmath38 with similar expressions holding for the other axes . from dwek",
    "et al . ( 1995 ) , for the milky way bulge , @xmath39kpc and @xmath40kpc .",
    "thus , for most of the halo , tidal deformations along the @xmath37-axis are negligible .",
    "this in principle represents an anisotropic tidal field that could yield a clear signature in the cluster deformations .",
    "however , one has to remember that gcs orbits are not exactly radial and in general not aligned with the major axis of the bulge",
    ". since the remaining two axes are quite similar , on average the gc _ sees _ mostly spherically symmetric tidal forces , thus it suffices to consider spherically symmetric potentials .    for our simulations",
    ", we represent the gc by a king model with a central potential @xmath41 and a half mass radius of 10 pc .",
    "this is within the range of observed gcs in the milky way , but on the loosely bound end of this distribution .",
    "for a more tightly bound gc the disruption and distortion effects would be smaller .",
    "we consider parabolic orbits with perigalactic distances @xmath42 and @xmath43  pc . for bound orbits",
    ", the speed at perigalacticon would be smaller so in this sense our calculations give a lower limit on the amount of distortion .",
    "the initial location of the globular cluster was sufficiently far from the center of the galaxy so that tidal effects at the start of the simulation were negligible .",

    "as a test , case c3 was repeated with @xmath49 to verify that results are not sensitive to @xmath7 at this level .    at each step during the evolution",
    ", we monitored the 3d shape of the gc using the inertia tensor @xmath50 where the sum is over all the particles in the cluster and @xmath51 .",
    "although this method provides useful information about the development of the deformations , it does not take into account projection effects . to connect with observations , following @xcite",
    ", we also characterize the gc shape by projecting the cluster onto an arbitrary plane on the  sky . \" the cluster s ellipticity , @xmath52 , is then obtained from @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) are the eigenvalues of the 2d inertia tensor .",
    "this ellipticity , of course , depends on the orientation that is chosen to perform the projection .",
    "thus we must compute the probability , @xmath57 , of viewing the cluster with a given ellipticity . the procedure for estimating @xmath57 is as follows : given a snapshot of a gc from an encounter with the bulge",
    ", we define first a coordinate system with its origin at the cluster s center of mass . at this origin",
    ", we select @xmath58 directions with solid angle @xmath59 that cover uniformly the @xmath60 plane . the gc is then projected in planes perpendicular to those @xmath58 directions , and its ellipticity is computed .",
    "finally , @xmath57 is obtained from a histogram of these ellipticities .",
    "a reasonable starting point to understand the onset of tidal deformations of gcs by galactic bulges is to show the outcome of a simulation for a typical orbit .",
    "figure  1 shows the evolving gc along the orbit for case c3 , with blow  up views at selected points .",
    "the gc has been projected on the orbital plane since distortions along this plane are dominant for these encounters .",
    "distortion begins as soon as the gc reaches the tidal radius ; for this case @xmath61  pc for stars at twice the half mass radius of the cluster . the mechanism behind the distortion of a gc is basically the same as that for the case of self - gravitating spheres of gas ( stars ) .",
    "that is , the energy required to induce deformation or even disruption is provided at the expense of the orbital kinetic energy of the gc . as mentioned before , and clearly shown in fig .  1",
    ", the core of the gc remains almost intact . only the _ halo _ of the gc develops a quadrupole distortion that can be spun up via gravitational torques @xcite .",
    "stars closest to the center of the bulge move faster than those furthest , resulting in the spreading of energy of the stars in the gc .",
    "this gives rise to the `` twisting '' isophotes apparent in the distorted clusters shown in fig .  1 .",

    "a sense of the degree of deformation is obtained from the relative size of these eigenvalues .",
    "two general types of deformation can be detected depending on the value of @xmath45 ; however , both types lead to final prolate configurations . for all cases ,",
    "initially two of the principal axes ( or equivalently eigenvalues ) decrease , and the third one ( initially pointing in the direction of the bulge s center ) increases . as the gc continues its orbit ( still inside of the tidal radius ) , the alignment of the major axis with the line joining the bulge and gc s centers is no longer possible , in spite of the induced torques on the gc , which act trying to restore the original alignment .",
    "tidal forces halt the growth of the prolate distortion . in cases with @xmath62  pc ,",

    "the clusters most likely to have observable distortions in the milky way are those that have passed near to the galactic center .",

    ". further information could be extracted by considering the colors of the stars since a different distribution is expected for the cluster and for the galactic background .",
    "we conclude that the main factor in assessing whether bulge shocking should be observable in one or more present  day milky way globulars is whether any of the clusters actually has passed within @xmath86400  pc of the bulge center .",
    "( the gc that we have chosen is realistic , but fairly loosely bound . the distances at which distortion and destruction become important would be smaller for a more tightly bound cluster . )",
    "the key period for observation of the tidal distortion effect is while the cluster is still within a couple of kpc of the galactic center .",
    "figure 7 showed that the distortions do not persist once the cluster has passed out into the galaxy .",
    "a search for the distortion signature of bulge shocking can be used to place limits on the orbits of present day globulars .",
    "it is expected that most clusters that passed regularly within the bulge on their orbits were destroyed many billions of years ago .",
    "however , three of the 25 globular clusters for which proper motions were measured were found to have orbits that will bring them within 1  kpc of the galactic center , one of them within 300  pc @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the shapes of globulars close to the galactic center is therefore of interest .",

    "8 contours of smoothed pixel maps for six of the clusters illustrated in fig .",
    "these were constructed by observing each of the oriented clusters from a distance of 8  kpc , and assigning the particles to pixels that were @xmath87 square arcminutes , i.e. @xmath88 . contours were drawn by first applying a gaussian smoothing filter with @xmath89  pixels .",
    "pixels near the center of the image , those with values larger than the threshhold of 1000 stars per pixel , were reset to 1000 so that the central structure did not overwhelm the outer contours in the smoothing process .",

    "the resulting maps of our similated gcs are somewhat similar to some of the observed gcs , suggesting that perhaps tidal distortions have already been observed in our galaxy .",
    "however , we should note that the grillmair clusters are all at galactocentric distances larger than 8  kpc . if the tidal distortions are in fact due to bulge shocking as we have discussed , this implies that these clusters have passed at least within 1  kpc of the galactic center which is unlikely for the majority of the twelve .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , galaxies of various types at different stages of evolution show different distributions of ellipticities @xcite . in our galaxy and m31",
    "there has been time for two  body relaxation to destroy velocity anisotropies .",
    "we would predict that distortion should occur in many young galaxies due to bulge shocking . depending on the initial distribution of orbits of gcs and on their spatial distribution , the early ellipticity distribution of clusters",
    "could be skewed to low values due to this process .",
    "some other environments are more likely to currently be active sites of extensive bulge shocking .",
    "we repeated runs c5 and c13 to explore the distortions expected for a parabolic orbit passing within 200  pc of the center of an elliptical galaxy containing a supermassive black hole .",
    "depending on the orbital distribution , in a young elliptical with a large gc population this situation may be more likely than it is for a gc to pass within 400  pc of the galactic center .",
    "in general , the initial distribution of clusters could be spatially concentrated toward the galaxy center , so that many orbits are subject to bulge shocking .",
    "in a young galaxy with close to its initial distribution of clusters , we expect many to have the `` twisting isophotes '' distortions that we describe here .",
    "the merger products of recent interacting giant galaxies perhaps provide the most ideal laboratory for direct detection of the destruction of gcs . as mentioned in the introduction , in several of these galaxies more than one thousand young star clusters are found , with masses somewhat larger on average than globulars @xcite .",
    "these clusters have properties consistent with the predecessors of gcs .",
    "we predict that a number of the globulars in merger products should exhibit the unique signature of distortion by bulge shocking .",
    "globular clusters can just be resolved at the distances of these interacting pairs and distortions of their outer layers would be impossible to observe .",
    "however , the gcs produced by more extreme cases of bulge shocking ( which should be more common in this environment than in the milky way ) will have large eccentricities even at the half mass radius and should have larger effective radii . both relatively gentle and gradual tidal distortions and more dramatic destructive shocking must play a role in shaping the distribution of new globulars .",
    "a statistical study of the globular cluster distribution as a function of the age of the merger product would provide constraints on its evolution . some of the massive young star clusters in the merger product ncg 1569 seem to have relatively high ellipticities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of the young inner clusters in ngc 7252 have larger effective radii than any outer clusters in the same galaxy @xcite .",
    "constraints based on studies of the ellipticity distributions of galaxies of various types could lead to a better understanding of the formation and evolution of globulars in the milky way and in general .",
    "we are grateful to m. warren for making available his tree - code .",
    "we also thank s. hunsberger for providing the code used to estimate the galactic background of disk and halo stars .",
