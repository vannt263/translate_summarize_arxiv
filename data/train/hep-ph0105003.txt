    "meson distribution amplitudes are defined and the sudakov factor from threshold resummation is derived in the appendices .",
    "the suggestion that a hadronic form factor is calculable in pqcd was first made in ref .",
    "the rough idea is summarized as follows .",
    "one expands the bound - state wave function for a pion in terms of fock states containing on - shell partons ( quarks or gluons ) @xcite , @xmath31 define a soft function @xmath32 at a typical hadronic scale @xmath33 as the initial wave function , @xmath34 the wave function @xmath35 can be related to @xmath32 via @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an irreducible kernel and @xmath38 the green function involving only hard loop momenta .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath39 is then expressed as a convolution integral , @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the momentum of the initial - state pion , @xmath42 large momentum transfer , and @xmath43 . here",
    "we have written the parton momenta associated with the initial state and final state as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , in the notation @xmath46 , and made explicit the dependence of the two - parton wave function @xmath47 on @xmath41 and @xmath48 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fef ] ) contains leading contributions , and ellipses represent those from higher fock states , which are down by powers of @xmath49 in the light - cone gauge and by powers of @xmath18 .",
    "the leading diagrams are displayed in fig .  [ leading ] .",
    "it can be shown that the large momentum transfer @xmath50 flows through the hard amplitude @xmath51 , and that all nonperturbative dynamics goes into wave functions .",
    "one can therefore compute @xmath51 perturbatively .",
    "however , it was pointed out that the above argument suffers a grave difficulty @xcite : the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 may be infrared divergent , because important contribution to the form factor comes from the region , where the exchanged gluons are soft .",

    "if we ignore @xmath57 , it has been shown that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ pff ] ) is dominated by contributions from the end - point regions with @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "if the pion wave function does not vanish at @xmath17 , the integral will be even infrared divergent .",
    "if we somehow regulate the infrared singularity by an appropriate choice of the wave function , the running coupling constant @xmath60 evaluated at the hard gluon momentum @xmath61 is still too large to make sense out of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the above end - point singularity corresponds to the picture of the pion form factor feynman had in mind . in the so - called brick - wall frame the initial - state pion with momentum @xmath62",
    "is struck by a space - like current of momentum @xmath63 , and turns around with momentum @xmath64 as shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman ] .",
    "feynman pointed out that the major contribution to the form factor comes from the region , where one of the partons carries the full pion momentum .",
    "the rest of partons , being all wee partons , do not know in which direction they are moving .",
    "the resulting configuration is essentially identical to the initial - state pion except that the momentum of the fast parton is reversed .",
    "hence , feynman claimed that the @xmath50 dependence of the pion form factor is related to the probability of finding a single parton carrying all the pion momentum .",
    "feynman s picture is consistent with the statement that the form factor is dominated by the singular part of eq .",
    "( [ perp ] ) .",
    "because it is singular , we can not compute the form factor .",
    "we argue that feynman s picture of the pion form factor is false .",
    "consider a qed example .",
    "when an electron undergoes hard scattering , it can not help but emit infinitely many photons in the direction of the electron momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "the elastic scattering cross section @xmath65 at finite angle vanishes at high energy , implying that the probability for the final @xmath66 state being accompanied by no photons diminishes . in other words ,",
    "the final state must be accompanied by many photons . in the qcd case of the pion form factor , when a quark inside the pion gets hit by a current",
    ", the final state will contain many gluons unless the spectator quark is nearby to shield the color charge .",
    "when one of the quarks carries all the momentum , the rest of the pion can not shield the color charge of the fast quark , and many gluons will be emitted in arbitrary directions during the hard scattering .",
    "thus , the final configuration ending up as a single pion is extremely unlikely .",
    "this is so - called sudakov suppression on exclusive processes at kinematic end points .",
    "therefore , the contribution from fig .",
    "[ feynman ] is negligible , and the end - point singularity does not exist !    in the above argument we have ignored the term @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ pff ] ) .",
    "small @xmath4 in momentum space corresponds to large transverse distance @xmath67 of two valence quarks .",
    "the color charge of the quark , which is struck by the current , is not shielded in this large @xmath67 region , and will emit many gluons . the probability for having a single pion in the final state is then vanishingly small .",
    "that is , this configuration can not contribute to the form factor .",
    "hence , the momentum space with @xmath68 , where the end - point singularity occurs , is also sudakov suppressed @xcite .",

    "[ suda2 ] .",
    "we observe that the sudakov factor decreases fast at large @xmath67 for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , which corresponds precisely to the end - point region in eq .",

    "the end - point singularity is absent , and the major contribution to fig .",
    "[ leading ] comes from the region with hard gluon exchanges .",

    ". the origin of these terms can be simply understood by means of the field - current identity from chiral symmetry , @xmath87    it is easy to observe that twist-3 contributions are suppressed by a power of @xmath88 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are known to be @xmath89 as the hard amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ perp ] ) is convoluted with these distribution amplitudes , we find that twist-2 contribution is finite , while twist-3 ones are logarithmically divergent without sudakov suppression .",
    "the sudakov factor then introduces an effective cut - off to the integral at @xmath90 , and the twist-3 contributions are proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "that is , the power counting is not altered by a logarithmic divergence in the factorization formula .",
    "as shown later , the power counting for contributions to the @xmath3 meson transition form factors is modified by linear divergences in the factorization formulas .",
    "therefore , the different end - point behavior leads to different power counting rules for the pion form factor and for the @xmath3 meson transition form factors .",
    "in the @xmath3 meson rest frame , we define the @xmath3 meson momentum @xmath41 and the pion momentum @xmath92 in the light - cone coordinates : @xmath93 with the energy fraction @xmath94 carried by the pion .",

    "however , since @xmath95 is mainly in the plus direction with @xmath100 , the hard amplitudes will not depend on the plus component @xmath101 as explained below .",

    "if this configuration is responsible for the decay , it is impossible to compute @xmath103 using pqcd .",

    "the contributions to the @xmath21 form factor @xmath103 are then logarithmically divergent at twist 2 and linearly divergent at twist 3 .",
    "we argue that as the end - point region is important , the corresponding large double logarithms @xmath20 need to be organized into a jet function @xmath108 as a consequence of threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "this jet function vanishes as @xmath109 , and modifies the end - point behavior of meson distribution amplitudes effectively .",
    "this modification provides a plausible explanation for the model of the twist-3 pion distribution amplitude proportional to @xmath110 , which was adopted in @xcite .",

    "we emphasize that the hard scale for heavy - to - light decays must be @xmath119 in order to define a gauge - invariant @xmath3 meson distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "we shall include the sudakov factor associated with the light spectator quark of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "whether this factor is essential will be determined by the @xmath3 meson distribution amplitude . since the @xmath3 meson is dominated by soft dynamics with @xmath120 ,",
    "the associated sudakov effect is minor compared to that from the energetic pion .    with the possible order of magnitude of @xmath121 , a taylor expansion of the hard gluon propagator near the end point ,",
    "@xmath122 is certainly not appropriate .",
    "a more reasonable treatment is to keep @xmath115 in the denominators of internal particle propagators , and to drop @xmath115 in the numerators , which are power - suppressed compared to other @xmath123 terms . under this prescription ,",
    "the sudakov factor from @xmath4 resummation can be introduced into pqcd factorization theorem without breaking gauge invariance of the hard amplitudes . for the same reason",
