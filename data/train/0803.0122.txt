    "the distribution of stellar masses that form in a star - formation event in a given volume of space is called the initial mass function ( imf ) and together with the star formation efficiency , the imf dictates the evolution and fate of star clusters .",
    "present estimations of the observed imf do not constrain the nature of the imf ( see e.g. kroupa 2007 ) .",
    "the universality of the imf of open clusters is still an open question because elementary considerations suggest that the imf ought to depend on star - forming conditions ( larson 1998 ) .",
    "therefore it is important to find systematic variations of the imf with different star - forming conditions .",
    "identifying these variations would allow us to study early cosmological events ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "open clusters possess many favorable characteristics for imf studies e.g. , clusters contain an ( almost ) coeval set of stars at the same distance with the same metallicity ; hence , difficulties like complex corrections for stellar birth rates , life times , etc .",
    "associated with determining the mass function ( mf ) from field stars are automatically avoided .",
    "the observed mf of a star cluster can in principle be determined from the observed luminosity function ( lf ) using theoretical stellar - evolutionary models . since the mfs of intermediate / old age",
    "open clusters may be affected with time due to stellar as well as dynamical evolutionary effects , we can only estimate the present day mass function .    in recent years ,",
    "luminosity and mass functions have been determined for a number of open clusters using homogeneous photoelectric or ccd data and reliable cluster membership criteria ( cf .",

    "although the average slope of the mf does not seem to be very different from the salpeter ( 1955 ) value , pandey et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2005 ) found that the nature of the mf in open clusters does not remain the same over the entire region of the cluster and the slope of the mf steepens as radial distance from the cluster center increases .",
    "the nucleus and the corona ( extended region of the star cluster ) are two main regions in open clusters ( kholopov 1969 ) .",
    "the nucleus of a cluster usually contains relatively bright i.e. massive ( @xmath4 3 @xmath5 ) stars along with low mass stars ( see e.g. brandl et al .",
    "1999 ) ; whereas the corona , which contains a large number of faint and low mass ( @xmath6 1 @xmath5 ) stars , has important bearing on studies related to the mass function .",
    "extensive studies of the coronal regions of clusters have not been carried out so far mainly because of non - availability of photometric data in a large field around open star clusters .",
    "therefore , considering the importance of low mass stars in the coronae of star clusters , we have generated a homogeneous wide - field photometric data - base around 9 open star clusters using a @xmath7 ccd mounted on a schmidt telescope ( kiso , japan ) , covering a @xmath8 field ( sharma et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter paper i ) . in this paper",
    "we study the mass function and photometric binary contents in those nine open clusters .",
    "wide field broad - band ccd photometric observations of the clusters were carried out during 2001 november 19 - 25 using the 105 cm schmidt telescope of the kiso observatory .",
    "a detailed description of the observations and data reduction is given in our previous paper ( paper i ) .",

    "initial processing of the data frames was done in the usual manner using iraf and eso - midas data reduction packages .",
    "photometry of cleaned frames was carried out using daophot software ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the psf was obtained for each frame using several uncontaminated stars .",
    "the fwhm of the star images varied between @xmath14 and @xmath15 from night to night .",
    "the observations were calibrated by observing standard stars in sa95 ( landolt 1992 ) having brightnesses @xmath16 and color indices @xmath17 .",
    "calibration of the instrumental magnitudes to the standard system was done using the procedure outlined by stetson ( 1992 ) .",
    "the errors become significantly larger ( @xmath40.1 mag ) for stars fainter than @xmath18 mag ; therefore , the measurements below this magnitude are not reliable and have not been used in the present study .",
    "with the help of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) we can derive the observed luminosity function ( lf ) of probable main sequence cluster members and then the mass function ( mf ) using theoretical evolutionary models , for which we adopt those of bertelli et al .",
    "the factors which influence the determination of lfs from the observations are the accuracy of cluster parameters , data incompleteness and field - star contamination .",
    "the estimation of these factors and their treatment are described in the following subsections .",
    "the cluster parameters , listed in table 1 , are derived using the cmds as discussed in paper i. the cmds for stars lying within the cluster regions show a well - defined and broad main - sequence ( ms ) .",
    "barring be 62 , other clusters manifest a uniform reddening in the cluster region . since the error in magnitude estimation for stars with @xmath1918 mag is @xmath20 mag",
    ", we can conclude that the presence of probable binaries and field stars should be the main cause for broadening of the ms in these clusters . in the case of",
    "be 62 variable reddening in the cluster region along with the presence of probable binaries and field stars , should be the cause of the broad ms .",
    "the extinction towards the clusters be 62 , ngc 1960 , ngc 2301 and ngc 2323 was estimated using the @xmath21 two color diagram , whereas in the case of the other five clusters ngc 1528 , ngc 2287 , ngc 2420 , ngc 2437 and ngc 2548 , the extinction was estimated using the @xmath22 or @xmath23 cmds .",
    "the reddening in be 62 varies from @xmath24 mag to @xmath25 mag .",
    "the distances and ages of the clusters were obtained by visual fitting of the theoretical isochrones by bertelli et al .",

    "the accuracy of the distance estimates is @xmath3 10 per cent , while that of age determination is about 20 percent .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath29 , distance and age of the target clusters ( cf .",
    "paper i ) are given in table 1 and have been used in further analysis .",
    "in paper i , we have studied the radial extent and structure of these clusters .",
    "the center of the cluster was estimated by convolving a gaussian kernel with the stellar distribution and taking the point of maximum density as the center .",
    "projected radial stellar density in various concentric circles was obtained by dividing the number of stars in each annulus by its area .",
    "the extent of the cluster ` @xmath30 ' is defined as the point where the radial density becomes constant and merges with the field - star density . within the uncertainties , the king model ( king 1962 ) reproduces well the radial density profiles ( rdps ) of the clusters studied in the present work . as an example the rdp of the cluster ngc 1960 along with the fitted king profile is shown in figure 1 . for this cluster , the core radius @xmath31 , defined as the radial distance at which the value of radial density becomes half of the central density ( cf .",
    "paper i ) , and cluster extent @xmath32 come out to be @xmath33 arcmin ( 1.2 pc ) and 14 arcmin ( 5.4 pc ) , respectively .",
    "the structural parameters obtained by fitting the king - model surface - density profile to the observed radial density - profile of main - sequence stars having @xmath34 mag are taken from paper i and given in table 2 .",
    "it is well established that clusters have extended regions ( coronae ) .",
    "field - star contamination increases considerably in the coronal region of the cluster .",
    "the present observations have been made in a wide field ( @xmath35 ) ; the region outside the cluster extent ( @xmath36 ) has been used to estimate the field - star contamination in the cluster region .      to study the lf / mf",
    ", it is first necessary to remove field - star contamination from the sample of stars in the cluster region . in the absence of a proper - motion study",
    ", we used a statistical criterion to estimate the number of member stars in the cluster region . on the basis of a single passband alone",
    "it is difficult to establish that a particular star is in fact a member of the cluster .",
    "therefore , two passbands , such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are required to identify the cluster members .",
    "we used @xmath23 cmd to estimate the membership as well as the lf of the cluster .",
    "the contamination due to field stars is greatly reduced by selecting a sample of stars which are located near the well - defined ms as described by pandey et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2005 ) .",
    "the same envelopes were used for the @xmath23 cmd of the field region to estimate the contamination in the cluster region due to field stars .",
    "after normalizing the area we can find the number of field stars which are considered to be present per unit area in each magnitude bin .",
    "as an example , selection of the ms sample in the case of ngc 1960 is shown in figure 2 .    the photometric data may be incomplete due to various reasons e.g. crowding of the stars , detection limit etc .",
    "the incompleteness correction is necessary if we want to analyze the lf / mf of the stars in the cluster . to determine the completeness factor we used the addstar routine of daophot ii",
    "this method has been used by various authors ( cf .",
    "pandey et al . ,",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "briefly , the method consists of randomly adding artificial stars of known magnitude and position into the original frame .",
    "the frames are re - reduced using the same procedure used for the original frame .",
    "the ratio of the number of stars recovered to those added in each magnitude interval gives the completeness factor , cf , as a function of magnitude .",
    "in practice we followed the procedure given by sagar and richtler ( 1991 ) and added artificial stars to both @xmath37 and @xmath38 images in such a way that they have similar geometrical locations but differ in @xmath38 brightness according to mean @xmath39 colors of the ms stars .",
    "the luminosity distribution of artificial stars is chosen in such a way that more stars are inserted into the fainter magnitudes bins . in all about 15 per cent of the total stars",
    "are added so that the crowding characteristics of the original frame do not change significantly ( cf .",
    "sagar & richtler , 1991 ) . to have satisfactory statistics for the determination of cf , a number of independent sets of artificial stars are inserted into a given data frame ( see for e.g. table 3 ) .",
    "the minimum value of the cf of the pair thus obtained is used to correct the data for incompleteness ( cf .",
    "sagar & richtler , 1991 ) . as an example , the cf along with relevant information for ngc 1960 is given in table 3 .",
    "as expected the incompleteness of the data increases with increasing magnitude and increasing stellar crowding .",
    "the number of probable cluster members in the two sub - regions of the cluster was obtained by subtracting the contribution of field stars ( corrected for data incompleteness ) from each magnitude bin of the contaminated sample of ms stars ( also corrected for data incompleteness ) .",
    "the statistics in the case of one of the clusters , ngc 1960 , is given in table 4 .",
    "the mf is often expressed by the power law , @xmath40 , where the slope of the mf is given as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of stars per unit logarithmic mass interval .",
    "the classical value derived by salpeter ( 1955 ) for the slope of the imf is @xmath1 .",
    "the main - sequence lf , obtained with the help of cmds for two sub - regions of the target clusters , has been converted into a mf using the theoretical model of bertelli et al .",
    "the resultant mf data for the cluster ngc 1960 are given in table 5 .",
    "the mfs of the target clusters for two sub - regions as well as for the whole cluster region are shown in figure 3 . in the specified mass range",
    "the mf can be represented by a single power law .",
    "the value of mf slopes @xmath43 , obtained by using the least - square solution in the specified mass range has also been given in table 6 .",
    "for intermediate age clusters the mass ranges are in general @xmath44 but for be 62 and ngc 1960 , which are the youngest clusters in the sample , the mass range is slightly higher . despite large errors in @xmath43 values , table 6",
    "indicates that in seven out of nine clusters the values of @xmath43 are steeper in the outer region as compared to that in the inner region . barring the cluster ngc 1960 ,",
    "the difference in the values of @xmath43 for inner and outer regions is less than @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the steeper values of @xmath43 in the outer regions may be attributed to mass segregation",
    ". there is evidence of mass segregation in some galactic and lmc clusters , with higher mass stars preferentially located towards the center of the cluster ( see e.g. fisher et al .",
    "1998 ; pandey et al .",
    "1992 , 2001 , 2005 and references therein , kumar et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to evaluate the degree of mass segregation in clusters",
    ", we subdivided the samples into two mass groups as indicated in figure 4 , which shows the cumulative distribution of ms stars as a function of radius in two different mass groups .",
    "in the case of six clusters ( be 62 , ngc 1528 , ngc 1960 , ngc 2323 , ngc 2420 and ngc 2437 ) figure 4 reveals the effect of mass segregation in the sense that relatively massive stars tend to lie near the cluster center . in the case of be 62 , ngc 1960 , ngc 2323 and ngc 2420 the kolmogrove - smirnov test confirms the above mentioned mass segregation at a confidence level better than 99 per cent , whereas in the case of ngc 1528 and ngc 2437 the confidence level is better than 90 per cent and 95 per cent , respectively .",
    "observations of mass segregation in several young clusters in the galaxy ( e.g. moffat 1970 ; herbst & miller 1982 ; larson 1982 ; sagar et al . 1988 ; pandey , mahara & sagar 1992 ; hillenbrand 1997 ; raboud & mermilliod 1998 ) as well as in the magellanic clouds ( fischer et al . 1998 and references therein ) suggest that mass segregation may be the imprint of the star formation process itself . on the other hand ,",
    "if clusters had a uniform spatial stellar - mass distribution at the time of formation , the spatial stellar - mass distribution would change with time as clusters evolve dynamically . because of equipartition of energy the low - mass stars would attain high velocity and move away from the cluster center , consequently higher concentration of high mass stars towards the center of the cluster could be observed ( cf .",
    "mathieu 1985 ; mathieu & latham 1986 ; mcnamara & sekiguchi 1986 ) . to decide whether mass segregation is primordial or due to dynamical relaxation",
    ", we have to estimate the dynamical relaxation time , @xmath47 , the time in which the individual stars exchange sufficient energy so that their velocity distribution approaches that of a maxwellian equilibrium .",
    "the dynamical relaxation time is given by :    @xmath48    where n is the number of cluster stars , @xmath49 is the radius containing half of the cluster mass and @xmath50 is the average mass of cluster stars ( spitzer & hart 1971 ) .",
    "we have estimated the relaxation time @xmath51 for all the target clusters to decide whether the mass segregation discussed above is primordial or due to dynamical relaxation .",
    "the total number of ms stars and the total mass of the ms stars in the given mass range ( see table 7 ) are obtained with the help of the mf .",
    "this mass should be considered as a lower limit to the total mass of the cluster .",
    "for the half - mass radius , we used half of the cluster extent ( @xmath52 ) obtained from the optical data ( see . table 2 ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution of all the stars , shown by dotted curve in figure 4 , indicates that the 50 per cent of the cluster stars lie within @xmath53 , therefore half of the cluster extent seems to be a reasonable approximation for the half - mass radius .",
    "the values of various parameters as well as the resultant @xmath47 for the target clusters are given in table 7 .",
    "a comparison of cluster age with its dynamical relaxation time in the case of intermediate / old age clusters ( age @xmath54 yr ; see table 7 ) indicates that the former is greater than the latter , leading to the conclusion that dynamical evolution could also be the reason for the observed mass segregation . in the case of the young clusters",
    "be 62 and ngc 1960 , the dynamical relaxation time is comparable to the age of the clusters hence the observed segregation in these clusters could be because of both the imprint of the star formation process and dynamical relaxation .      during the last decade , synthetic cmds have been used to study various properties of clusters , e.g. , the mf and the influence of unresolved photometric binaries on the lf , etc .",

    "mass segregation in the case of the young cluster be 62 indicates that mass segregation could be due to the star formation process itself , whereas in the case of intermediate / old clusters the mass segregation can also be explained on the basis of dynamical evolution . *",
    "the mf slope of the outer region / whole cluster region is seem to be related to the dynamical - evolution parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the mf slopes ( particularly in the outer region of the cluster ) undergo an exponential decay with @xmath2 .",
    "* there is evidence for initial mass - segregation within the young clusters and decrease in @xmath99 with @xmath2 is interpreted as evaporation of low mass stars from the outer regions of the clusters . *",
    "it is found that evaporation of low - mass members from outer regions of the clusters is not significant at larger galactocentric distances . *",
    "the clusters having larger core / cluster radii have relatively steeper mf slopes . at larger galactocentric distances the mfs of the clusters",
    "are found to be steeper .",
    "we do not find any correlation between mf and age of the clusters . *",
    "the present analysis of the synthetic cmds reveals a detectable photometric binary content of about 30% - 40% in the intermediate age clusters .",
