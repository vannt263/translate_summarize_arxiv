    "single molecule magnets ( smms ) have been the subject of intense research activity since the first and mostly studied one , mn@xmath4-ac , was reported @xcite .",
    "these metal - organic clusters are usually characterized by a large spin ground state s and an easy - axis anisotropy which determines the zero - field splitting ( zfs ) of the @xmath2 state sublevels .",
    "the resulting magnetic bistability makes them interesting for magnetic storage applications due to their potential to shrink the magnetic bit down to the size of one single molecule . until recently and despite the common efforts of chemists and physicists to find suitable systems that could retain the magnetization for a long time at non cryogenic temperatures , mn@xmath4-ac was the system showing the ` highest ' blocking temperature ( 3.5 k ) and anisotropy barrier ( 74.4 k)@xcite .",
    "the relaxation time in the classical regime follows the arrhenius law : @xmath5 ( ref . ) .",
    "according to this , there are two key points that have to be considered for the realization of an ideal smm .",
    "first of all , the anisotropy barrier , given to a first approximation by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the axial anisotropy parameter ) , has to be sufficiently high .",
    "this is to prevent the reversal of the magnetization via a classical thermally activated multistep orbach process mediated by spin - phonon interactions .",
    "this can be achieved by the simultaneous increase of @xmath7 and @xmath2 , two variables that are intrinsically linked together @xcite .",
    "secondly , the pre - exponential factor @xmath8 in the arrhenius law has to be large .",
    "this factor is dominated by the time necessary to climb the upper states in the energy level diagram , and is proportional to @xmath9 ( ref . ) .",
    "in addition to the classical relaxation mechanism , the quantum tunneling of the magnetization ( qtm ) that characterizes the spin dynamics of smms , has to be taken into consideration and minimized for magnetic data storage application , since it provides a shortcut for the relaxation of the magnetization .",
    "+ therefore , to engineer smms able to retain the magnetization for long time it is crucial to control all the different mechanisms that provide a relaxation path for the system .",
    "recently we succeeded in the synthesis of a new class of mn@xmath10-based clusters that contributed in raising the anisotropy barrier and has served as a good model system to study the factors involved in the relaxation mechanism @xcite . +",
    "this class consists of hexanuclear mn@xmath10 clusters ( from now on mn@xmath0 ) which , despite the generally similar nuclear structure , display a rich variety of spin ground states and anisotropy energy barriers @xcite .",
    "the six mn@xmath10 ions are arranged in two triangles , with dominant ferromagnetic ( fm ) exchange interaction between the two triangles and fm or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions within the two triangles .",
    "it has been found that the nature of the intra - triangle exchange interaction can be switched from afm to fm by substituting the organic ligands bridging the mn@xmath10 ions , leading to a change of the ground state from a low spin ( @xmath1 ) to a high spin ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , deliberately targeted structural distortions have been successfully used to tune the values of the exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "the isotropic exchange interactions , and consequently the overall anisotropy barrier @xcite , is thus found to be very sensitive to the structural details .",
    "this has been also demonstrated using an alternative method for distorting the molecule , that is by applying external hydrostatic pressure and correlating the structural changes with the magnetic behavior @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite important to determine the exchange interactions for different structures to deduce magneto - structural correlations .",
    "this information can be then used to engineer new clusters with selectively modified molecular structures that match the optimized conditions for the desired magnetic properties .",
    "+ we have investigated three members of the family of mn@xmath0 clusters , with chemical formulas [ mn@xmath0o@xmath11(sao)@xmath0(o@xmath11cme)@xmath11(etoh)@xmath12@xmath134etoh ( * 1 * ) , [ mn@xmath0o@xmath11(et - sao)@xmath0(o@xmath11cph)@xmath11(etoh)@xmath14(h@xmath11o)@xmath11]@xmath132etoh ( * 2 * ) and [ mn@xmath0o@xmath11(et - sao)@xmath0(o@xmath11cph(me)@xmath11)@xmath11(etoh)@xmath0 ] ( * 3 * ) @xcite .",

    "however , despite having very similar structures , the three molecules have very different magnetic properties .",
    "the coupling between the magnetic ions occurs via superexchange pathways involving oxygen and nitrogen ions and is found to be extremely sensitive to intramolecular bond angles and distances .",
    "the particular arrangement of the magnetic ions provides exchange couplings lying in the cross - over region between afm and fm .",
    "for this reason , even small structural distortions have tremendous impact on the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "for example , while the coupling between the two triangles is ferromagnetic for all molecules , the intra - triangular coupling changes from antiferromagnetic in ( * 1 * ) to ferromagnetic in ( * 2 * ) and ( * 3 * ) due to a twisting of the oximate linkage .",
    "this results in a switching of the total spin ground state from @xmath1 to @xmath3 .",
    "systematic synthesis and studies of various members of the mn@xmath0 family have revealed that the nature of the coupling is extremely sensitive to the intra - triangular mn - o - n - mn torsion angles @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mn6_s4_s12 ] ) .",
    "there is a critical value for the torsion angle of @xmath20 , above which the pairwise exchange interaction switches from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic , while a further enhancement of the angle increases the strength of the fm interaction .",
    "this effect has been interpreted in terms of the particular arrangement of the manganese d@xmath21 orbitals with respect to the p - orbitals of the nitrogen and oxygen ions .",
    "a large ( small ) mn - o - n - mn torsion angle results in a small ( large ) overlap between the magnetic orbitals giving rise to ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic or weak ferromagnetic ) superexchange interactions @xcite . + molecules ( * 2 * ) and ( * 3 * ) have the same spin ground state @xmath3 but very different effective energy barriers ( @xmath22 k for ( * 2 * ) and @xmath23 k for ( * 3 * ) ) .",
    "this difference was found to be closely related to the exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "+ in order to understand this rich variety of behaviors , we performed a detailed spectroscopic characterization of the three molecules using inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and frequency domain magnetic resonance ( fdmr ) . fdmr is only sensitive to transitions with a predominantly intra - multiplet character , according to the selection rules @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , in ins both inter- and intra - multiplet transitions can be observed ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "thus , the combination of the two techniques allows assignment of all observed excitations @xcite .",
    "the determination of the model spin hamiltonian parameters enabled us to estimate theoretically the effective energy barrier for the low spin molecule ( * 1 * ) . similarly to what we previously reported for the two high spin molecules ( * 2 * ) and ( * 3 * ) , the results on ( * 1 * ) show how the presence of low - lying excited spin multiplets plays a crucial role in determining the relaxation of the magnetization .    in conventional systems ,",
    "the effects of s - mixing can be effectively modeled by the inclusion of fourth order zero - field splitting parameters in the giant spin hamiltonian @xcite . here",
    "we will show that this hamiltonian is completely inadequate for the description of the spin state energy level structure .",
    "non - deuterated polycrystalline samples were synthesized according to published methods @xcite .",

    "therefore , the fdmr measurements on ( * 1 * ) were performed on loose microcrystalline material ( 348 mg ) held between two quartz plates . in this unconventional measurement ,",
    "the detector signal was recorded as function of frequency at different temperatures .",
    "extreme care had to be taken to prevent the slightest positional changes of sample and equipment , which changes the standing wave pattern in the beam , precluding normalization .",
    "the normalized transmission was calculated by dividing the signal intensity at a given temperature by that at the highest temperature ( 70k ) .",

    "the experimental data collected on the three variants of mn@xmath0 clusters provide direct evidence that a general feature for this class of compounds is the nesting of excited multiplets within the ground state multiplet .",
    "this is an unavoidable effect when the isotropic exchange parameters have the same order of magnitude as the single ion anisotropy parameters , as it happens to be for mn@xmath0 .",
    "the nesting of spin states can be clarified by observing the energy level diagrams for the three molecules presented in fig .",
    "[ energylevels=4 ] and fig .",
    "[ energylevel ] .",
    "the diagram on the left shows the energy levels calculated by a diagonalization of the full spin hamiltonian , while the energy level scheme on the right hand side has been calculated considering the gsh approximation .",
    "it is clear that the gsh does not account for any of the spin states with @xmath2 different from @xmath109 that lie within the split gs energy level diagram .",
    "the above states represent a shortcut for the relaxation of the magnetization and can promote resonant inter - multiplet tunneling processes that manifest as additional steps in the magnetization curve absent in the gs model@xcite .",
    "the overall result is a lowering of the effective anisotropy barrier with respect to an ideal molecule where the spin ground state is well separated from the excited ones , as was firstly demonstrated in ref . .",
    "+ we have calculated the relaxation dynamics of molecule ( * 1 * ) following the same procedure adopted in ref . for molecules ( * 2 * ) and ( * 3 * ) . we applied a master equations formalism in which the magnetoelastic ( me ) coupling is modeled as in ref .",

    "[ eq : h_dimer ] is given by : @xmath111 where @xmath112 are the components of the cartesian quadrupole tensor operator , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we found out that the resulting relaxation spectrum at low @xmath66 is characterized by a single dominating relaxation time whose @xmath66-dependence displays a nearly arrhenius behavior @xmath115 , as previously observed for molecules ( * 2 * ) and ( * 3 * ) @xcite .",
    "the relaxation dynamics of @xmath116 is indeed characterized by two separated time scales : fast processes that determine the equilibrium within each well of the double - well potential and a slow inter - well process that at low temperature determines the unbalancing of the populations of the two wells , and thus sets the time scale for the reversal of the magnetization . as can be observed from the energy level diagram of fig .",
    "[ energylevels=4 ] there are several levels that can be involved in the inter - well relaxation process , giving rise to an overall effective barrier @xmath79 different from the simple energy difference between the @xmath117 and @xmath118 states .",
    "the corresponding calculated energy barrier @xmath119= 32 k reproduces quite well the experimental value , @xmath79= 28 k. the lowering of the barrier is therefore attributed to the presence of these extra paths .",
    "indeed , the calculations for artificially isolated @xmath120 yield @xmath121 k. + it is worth commenting also on the @xmath7 value for the ground state of each molecule .",
    "whilst no large difference between the local @xmath76 of the low ( * 1 * ) and high ( ( * 2 * ) and ( * 3 * ) ) spin molecules is expected , the overall @xmath7 value , as determined using the gsh approximation , is much higher for the @xmath1 molecule ( @xmath122 mev ) than for the high spin molecules ( @xmath123 mev ) .",
    "however , this observation should not be misinterpreted .",
    "the difference arises from the fact that @xmath7 depends on the projection of the individual single - ion anisotropies of each magnetic ion onto the total spin quantum number @xmath2 . in the case where the @xmath2-mixing is negligible and",
    "the spin ground state is a good quantum number , the @xmath7 parameter for a specific state @xmath2 can be written as linear combination of the single - ions anisotropy tensors ( ref .",
    "): @xmath124 the projection coefficients @xmath125 of the single ion anisotropy to spin states of different @xmath2 values can differ significantly , giving rise to considerably different @xmath7 values .",
    "the ligand field study of various members of the mn@xmath0 family ( ref . ) provides experimental evidence of this .",
    "recent theoretical studies proposed that the intrinsic relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath7 causes a scaling of @xmath126 that goes approximately with @xmath127 ( see ref . and ) , raising the question whether it is worth trying to increase the value of spin ground state to obtain a larger energy barrier . indeed , higher spin ground states would correspond to lower @xmath7 parameters , neutralizing the overall effect on the height of the anisotropy barrier . in",
    "recently performed electron paramagnetic resonance studies the authors proposed that the barrier goes roughly with @xmath128 instead @xcite . in the specific case of mn@xmath0 , because of the very large @xmath2-mixing , the projection onto a well defined spin state is no more justified and it is not possible to associate the barrier @xmath126 to a defined @xmath2 value . however",
    ", if we consider the effective anisotropy barrier for artificially isolated @xmath129 and @xmath130 states ( i.e. @xmath131 k for ( * 1 * ) and @xmath132 k for ( * 2 * ) ) , we can confirm that the barrier does not go quadratically with @xmath2 , as one could naively deduce from the equation @xmath133 . indeed , u@xmath134/u@xmath135 = 2.2 @xmath136=9 .",
    "this confirms what has been pointed out in ref .",
    ", i.e. even though the highest anisotropy barrier is obtained with the molecule with the highest spin ground state , the increase of the total spin is not as efficient as one would expect and alternative routes , like increasing the single ion anisotropy , should be considered .",
    "we have performed ins and fdmr measurements on three variants of mn@xmath0 molecular nanomagnets , which have the same magnetic core and differ by slight changes in the organic ligands .",
    "ins measurements have unambiguously evidenced the presence of low lying excited states in all the three molecules .",
    "the combination of the two techniques enabled us to determine the spin hamiltonian parameters used for the analysis of the magnetic properties .",
    "the nesting of excited states within the ground state multiplet strongly influences the relaxation behavior and plays a crucial role in lowering the effective energy barrier .",
    "the calculations of the relaxation dynamics give results that are consistent with the experimental values and show that the highest barrier is obtained for ideal molecules with an isolated ground state .",
