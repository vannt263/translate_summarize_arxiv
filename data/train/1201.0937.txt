    "the redward co emission is composed of higher @xmath31 transitions , which are well separated in several targets .",
    "there is a general correlation between the relative amount of flux in the ly@xmath4 blue and red wing and the relative amount of flux seen in the low-@xmath31 and high-@xmath31 co emission .",
    "for example , in recx 15 and df tau , weak blue wing ly@xmath4 emission correlates with the lack of low-@xmath31 emission in their co bands , whereas in v4046 sgr we observe strong blue and red emission in both the ly@xmath4 and co profiles .",
    "this will motivate our modeling , as discussed in  [ analysis ] .",
    "the ( 14 - 3 ) band is mostly free of emission from other molecules or atoms ; only the weak h@xmath2 ( 4 - 2 ) p(19 ) line at 1316.55   appears in all targets .",
    "there is an h@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) p(18 ) line at 1320.22  , but it appears strongly only in df tau .",
    "overall , the low-@xmath31 bandhead and separated high-@xmath31 lines of the ( 14 - 3 ) band are uncontaminated , which is crucial for determining @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "for this reason , we primarily use the ( 14 - 3 ) band for analysis in all targets . by branching ratios , the ( 14 - 4 )",
    "band is stronger , however strong oi ] ( 1355.71  ) emission lines appear over the high-@xmath31 portion of the band in most targets .",
    "figure [ fig:1352 ] shows the ( 14 - 4 ) band for our sample , with similar continuum denotations as the ( 14 - 3 ) band .",
    "only v4046 sgr , recx 15 , and dm tau are free from contamination on the high-@xmath31 side .",
    "for these three targets we analyze both the ( 14 - 3 ) and ( 14 - 4 ) bands .    in v4046 sgr , df tau , dm tau , and recx 15 ,",
    "the high-@xmath31 lines are well separated .",
    "the high-@xmath31 lines of df tau , recx 15 , and dm tau appear at the width of the cos line - spread - function . in recx 11 and",
    "hd 135344b the co high-@xmath31 lines are not distinguishable from one another , although whether this is physical ( due to velocity broadening of close - in co ) or merely due to the lower s / n in the band is not clear . the ly@xmath4 profile of de tau is highly absorbed , yet the ( 14 - 3 ) features are evident to the eye .",
    "hn tau , dr tau , dk tau , lkca 15 , and gm aur show little co emission above the continuum . of those ,",
    "gm aur is the only target to have a ly@xmath4 profile that is mostly unabsorbed by circumstellar and interstellar h i.",
    "@xcite utilized a simple fluoresence model to calculate the temperature @xmath9 and column density @xmath5 for two cttss .",
    "however , they used the observed ly@xmath4 emission to excite the co. in our full sample , the targets demonstrate the need for a more detailed estimation of the incident ly@xmath4 radiation ; using the observed ly@xmath4 profiles as the incident radiation field can not reproduce the observed co band shape .",
    "for example , with df tau , more red wing ly@xmath4 emission than is seen is necessary to yield the strong co ( 14 - 3 ) high-@xmath31 line emission observed , relative to its weak low-@xmath31 emission .",
    "we therefore introduce a straight - forward model of the physical situation , shown in figure [ fig : lyman_description ] , which we use to re - construct the incident radiation .",
    "ly@xmath4 emission is created at the accretion funnel flow near the proto - stellar surface , as well as in the photosphere itself .",
    "the plot in figure [ fig : lyman_description ] shows such a model ly@xmath4 profile for v4046 sgr in red . along our line of sight",
    "the ly@xmath4 is then absorbed by h i in an outflow ( magenta ) , followed by interstellar gas ( green ) .",
    "our method consists of two steps : first , we create a series of model ly@xmath4 profiles that fit the observed profile after absorption by outflow and ism h i. second , we use each outflow - absorbed model ly@xmath4 emission in a co fluorescence model to match the observed co emission .",
    "the observed ly@xmath4 emission is modeled as :    @xmath37    where c@xmath38 is the continuum intensity near ly@xmath4 and the source ly@xmath4 profile @xmath39 is approximated as the sum of two gaussian emission components , parameterized by peaks @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as well as widths @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the first gaussian is at rest relative to the star , while the second gaussian component is centered at a velocity @xmath44 .",
    "the outflow absorber @xmath45 is characterized by a voigt profile with @xmath46 at a velocity @xmath47 , and is necessary to match blue - shifted absorption seen in most of the targets .",
    "the ism absorber @xmath48 is determined by a voigt profile with @xmath46 at the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "a@xmath27 values from table [ target_parameters ] and r@xmath27 = 4.0 were used to de - redden the data , according to the extinction curve from @xcite .",
    "seven parameters determine the two emission ( stellar and accretion shock ) and two absorption ( interstellar and outflow ) components . as a result",
    ", many parameter combinations exist that in the end fit the observed ly@xmath4 profile .",
    "however , only some will adequately produce the observed co emission , once run through the fluorescence model .",
    "our co fluorescence model uses a method similar to that implemented by @xcite .",
    "the ground rotational levels are populated thermally with @xmath9 , using dunham coefficients from @xcite to calculate ground state energy values .",
    "the ly@xmath4 flux absorbed by the ( 14 - 0 ) band is re - emitted according to the branching ratios for the ( 14 - @xmath28 ) transitions .",
    "however , instead of using the observed ly@xmath4 flux , we excite the co with the outflow - absorbed profile . for each ly@xmath4 profile produced in the first step ,",
    "we produce a model co emission band to fit to the data .",
    "the variable parameters in the co model are the gas rotational temperature ( @xmath9 ) , column density ( @xmath5 ) , and the velocity broadening of the emitting gas ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this @xmath49 value is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the gaussian emission line , assuming the broadening is primarily due to orbital motion . for a continuum",
    ", we use the average continuum level from nearby areas of the spectrum . assuming that the electronic ground state population can be described by a thermalized population , the resulting co emission is primarily dependent on @xmath5 and @xmath9 . as in @xcite",
    ", we make no assumptions about the spatial distribution of the co around the star . due to the low transition probabilities of the ( 14 - 0 ) band",
    "( @xmath16 10@xmath33 s@xmath34 ) , optical depth effects are minimal ; therefore , @xmath5 and the filling fraction of the co are degenerate .",
    "there are limitations to our assumption of a single co rotational temperature , as multiple temperatures are possible throughout the disk .",
    "the gas disk temperature varies based on height in the disk and distance from the star .",
    "as the entire disk is sampled in the cos aperture , co may be observed at multiple temperatures .",
    "however , a single temperature model does enable us to determine general characteristics of the co in a large sample with minimal parameters .",
    "future models of individual targets should take into account the effects of density and temperature on the radiative transfer of the ly@xmath4 radiation and fluorescent emission .      in half of the positive detection targets ,",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath5 are less than 0.5 dex and the uncertainties on @xmath9 are less than @xmath16200 k. high s / n in both the ly@xmath4 and co profile are required for this . in most of the positive detections , values for log@xmath50(@xmath5 ) are between 18 and 19 and temperatures lie between 100 and 600 k.      the top panel of figure [ fig : dftau_final ] shows representative ly@xmath4 model results for df tau .",
    "several model ly@xmath4 profiles are plotted over the observed ly@xmath4 profile .",
    "the red , blue , and green lines correspond to the maximum , average , and minimum ly@xmath4 emission profiles after being absorbed by the outflow h i of each respective model .",
    "these are displayed to convey the variety of incident radiation profiles that , when used in the co fluorescence model , produce co emission that matches the data .",
    "the magenta line shows a typical outflow + ism - absorbed profile that fits the ly@xmath4 profile . in the case of df tau",
    "the entire blue wing is absorbed , which we attribute to a non - gaussian absorber velocity profile ; therefore we only fit the red wing .",
    "the blue wing is generally fitted between 1210   and 1214  , while the red wing is fitted from 1217   to 1220  .",
    "we did not use two ly@xmath4 emission components for df tau and recx 11 , as a second component did not significantly improve the fit .",
    "strong h@xmath2 absorption exists in the ly@xmath4 wings of v4046 sgr , df tau , recx 15 , and dm tau @xcite ; a spline interpolation of the profile was used to minimize their influence on the fits .",
    "the h@xmath2 absorption may be present in the ly@xmath4 profile incident on the fluoresced co , but the absorption has a negligible effect on the resulting co fluorescence .",
    "we searched a grid of the parameters to find the best - fitting combinations .",

    "[ tbl : lyman_parameters_1 ] and [ tbl : lyman_parameters_2 ] we list parameter values of the best - fitting ly@xmath4 profiles .",
    "since our model ly@xmath4 profiles must not only fit the observed ly@xmath4 emission but also produce the appropriate co emission through our fluorescence model , we only include models that create co emission that fits the ( 14 - 3 ) band .",
    "the ly@xmath4 parameters listed are determined by taking the average and standard deviation of each parameter for all models .",
    "the broad range of values for the emission components reflects the variety of emission profiles that in combination with different absorbing profiles match the data .",
    "continuum values are determined by averaging emission - free ranges of the surrounding spectrum .",
    "the `` outflow '' absorber velocites for dm tau are positive , possibly due to predominantly inflowing material .",
    "overall , our combined values for @xmath53 and @xmath46 are similar to those measured previously in cttss @xcite .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : dftau_final ] shows a typical co model fit to the ( 14 - 3 ) band , along with its value for @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , this @xmath5 and @xmath9 combination is the best fit for only one of our model ly@xmath4 profiles .",

    "is generally excluded ; interstellar h i absorption removes any knowledge of the ly@xmath4 flux which results in co emission in this region .",

    "the models presented here assume isothermal co. relaxing this assumption would provide more flexibility in simultaneously fitting low - j and high - j emission lines .",
    "the cos observations of some tts may have enough sensitivity to test disk models that predict a range of gas temperatures .",
    "while the degeneracy of @xmath5 and the filling fraction prevents us from definitively determining the geometry of the uv - co around the star , comparing our measured uv - co properties with those of previously measured disk gas still reveals much about the spatial distribution of the gas .",

    "the gas in which the ir - co emission originates is typically warm , thermally excited at temperatures as high as @xmath161500 k. excitation diagrams of larger ir - co samples can be adequately described by lte models of a single - temperature slab of gas @xcite .",
    "line - width analysis suggests that this emission is produced @xmath57 1 au from the central star .",
    "this information , combined with our measured uv - co properties , presents two arguments that the uv - co and ir - co are spatially separate .",
    "the uv - co temperatures suggest separate populations , as our measured @xmath9 values are several times lower than typical ir - co temperatures .",
    "the ro - vibrational levels of the co ground electronic state are primarily populated based on the einstein a coefficients of each @xmath58 and @xmath31 level , relative to the temperature - dependant collision rates and gas density . models typically assume the ir - co lies in a `` skin '' of the gas disk where densities are high enough for the rotational temperature to be equal to the kinetic temperature @xcite .",
    "if this is also true for the uv - co , then it must lie in a different region of the disk where the gas kinetic temperature is lower .",
    "however , as temperature and density vary based on location in the disk it may be possible to find gas populations with thermal low-@xmath31 levels , while the high-@xmath31 levels are subthermal . in targets with well - defined high-@xmath31 lines ( v4046 sgr , df tau , recx 15 , and dm tau ) , these lines strongly influence the @xmath9 and @xmath5 fits .",
    "if densities are less than the critical densities for these high-@xmath31 states ( @xmath59 for @xmath31=18 at 400 k is @xmath60 @xmath61 ) , then the derived temperature could be less than that determined from the thermalized lower states . in this case",
    "the co density would have to be lower than the thermalized ir - co , and therefore be in a different region of the disk .",
    "our measured @xmath49 values enable us to spatially constrain the uv - co for the targets with well - defined high-@xmath31 lines . due to the blending of the uv - co bands we can not calculate the line width at zero intensity of individual @xmath31 transitions , from which the inner co radius is typically calculated @xcite .",
    "however , assuming that the fwhm of the high-@xmath31 lines is primarily due to orbital motion of the gas , we can calculate an average orbital radius @xmath62 :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the gravitational constant , @xmath65 the stellar mass , and @xmath66 the disk inclination , previously measured in the literature . for the values listed in appendix [ targets ] , we calculate @xmath62 for v4046 sgr , df tau , recx 15 , and dm tau : 2.76 au , 2.16 au , @xmath673.04 au , and @xmath671.56 au respectively .",

    "the @xmath49 values of recx 15 and dm tau are at the cos resolution , so we can only determine lower limits for @xmath62 in these disks .",

    "the temperature and @xmath49 disagreements lead us to the conclusion that the uv - co and ir - co are indeed separate populations .",
    "in addition to the spatial differences between the two co populations , there is no consistent agreement between the detection of ir - co and uv - co emission in our sample . dr tau exhibits strong ir - co emission @xcite , but no uv - co emission is observed .",

    "different morphology ( uv - co only , ir - co only , both ) is not a strong argument for separate gas populations . in principle , different morphologies could occur in a single gas population if the ly@xmath4 pumping and ir excitation mechanisms are not physically related .",
    "further study of a larger survey will be necessary to draw any solid conclusions on this matter , but the temperature and radius differences found in our analysis argue against a single gas population .",
    "the uv - co also appears to differ from h@xmath2 previously studied in cttss .",
    "h@xmath2 is best observed in the uv due to its lack of a permanent dipole moment . in the tw hya disk , @xcite detected h@xmath2 emission , measuring @xmath72 = 2500@xmath73 k and log@xmath74 = 18.5@xmath75 @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , france et al .",
    "( 2011 , in press ) observed h@xmath2 in absorption in the spectrum of aa tau , measuring @xmath72 = 2500@xmath76 k and log@xmath74 = 17.9@xmath77 @xmath8 .",
    "as with the ir - co , the differences in temperature suggest that the two populations reside in different regions of the disk .",
    "similar to the conclusion of france et al .",
    "( 2011 , in press ) about the aa tau co and h@xmath2 , a subthermal co population could explain the disparity .",
    "if the co and h@xmath2 are indeed cospatial , then the similarity of @xmath5 and @xmath74 derived from uv spectra would seem to violate the co / h@xmath2 ratio of 10@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is possible that during the process of star and planet formation , the co is enhanced and/or h@xmath2 removed from the gas phase in a way that increases the co / h@xmath2 ratio .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , collisions of large grains or planetesimals may re - release gas - phase co into the disk .",
    "in addition , h@xmath2 could be selectively dissociated by radiation in the inner disk .",
    "however , in order to truly compare both molecules the uv h@xmath2 and co emission must be studied with a self - consistent approach .",
    "comparing @xmath5 and @xmath9 with other disk properties published in the literature does not yield any significant correlations .",
    "for example , an increase in rotational temperature vs.  accretion rate might be expected ; higher accretion rates create greater fuv continuum and ly@xmath4 emission , which in turn heats the gas to higher temperatures via photo - electric heating .",
    "the fuv photons could also populate higher @xmath31 states in a way not possible by collisional processes alone .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ fig : n_t_mdot ] , there appears to be no correlation between temperature and accretion rate . over more than two orders of magnitude of accretion rate ,",
    "targets with strong co and ly@xmath4 emission well constrain the temperature between 200 k and 500 k with no apparent trend . only in dm tau and de",
    "tau is the temperature less constrained , but this is primarily due to their highly absorbed ly@xmath4 profiles .",
    "the total co emission from our sample can be evaluated by integrating the ( 14 - 3 ) band flux . referring to figures [ fig : lyman_1315 ] and [ fig : lyman_1315_non ] ,",
    "the ( 14 - 3 ) bands are summed between the dashed grey lines at 1315.2   and 1320  .",
    "the continuum level @xmath78 is determined from the surrounding line - free spectrum , and denoted by the horizontal solid black / blue / red line .",
    "the blue and red lines identify the low and high @xmath31 state emission regions , which are separately integrated .",
    "the dashed orange lines above and below mark the 1-@xmath25 error of the continuum level . the integrated flux values are listed in table [ tbl:1315_sum ] . for dr tau and lkca 15 we list zero flux , which actually corresponds to an overall negative flux . shown in figure [ fig : flux_ratios ] is ratio of ly@xmath4 blue to red flux vs. the ratio of co blue ( low-@xmath31 ) to red ( high-@xmath31 ) flux .",
    "this demonstrates our initial correlation between the relative strength of the ly@xmath4 photo - exciting radiation and the resulting co emission .    to test correlations with disk evolutionary properties we use the total co ( 14 - @xmath28 ) luminosity , calculated from the ( 14 - 3 ) band fluxes :    @xmath79    where f(14 - 3 ) is the integrated band flux , b(14 - 3 ) is the branching ratio listed in table [ tbl : band_ratios ] , and @xmath80 is the distance to the target . in figure",
    "[ fig : co_h2_mdot ] , @xmath81 shows a strong correlation with mass accretion rate .",
    "this is not surprising , as the amount of photo - exciting ly@xmath4 is expected to increase with accretion .",
    "combined with the weak opacity of the co ( 14 - 0 ) band , we are simply seeing the re - emission of most of the ly@xmath4 photons capable of being absorbed .    as a result",
    ", @xmath10 can not be used as a proper evolutionary diagnostic , despite the fact that accretion does decrease as a ctts ages @xcite .",
    "we attempt to correct for this by dividing the co luminosity by @xmath10 to compare with age .",
    "figure [ fig : co_age ] shows this relation , with a trend towards more co emission in more evolved systems .",
    "one interpretation is that as inner disks clear , the ly@xmath4 can more readily illuminate the co. v4046 sgr , hd135344b , dm tau , and gm aur are all confirmed transitional objects with cleared dust holes in the center of their disks @xcite , which would allow the ly@xmath4 photons to reach more co. co - ir emission from hd 135344b and gm aur support this argument , as the co - ir appears inside the inner dust radii @xcite .",
    "however , no uv - co is detected in the transitional disk lkca 15 a second interpretation would be the increase of gas - phase co through grain and planetesimal collisions @xcite .",
    "co produced in the dust disk could be transported to the inner disk surface as the system evolves .      finally , we measure flux in the 1712 - 1720   region , assuming that emission in this region is due to the ( 14 - 12 ) band . of particular note",
    "is how large these fluxes are compared to what would be expected from simply applying branching ratios to the ( 14 - 3 ) fluxes .",
    "figure [ fig : civ_pumped ] shows this graphically ; for one of the best - fit ( 14 - 3 ) models of recx 11 , the corresponding ( 14 - 12 ) emission is plotted over its observed 1712   emission .",
    "this trend is seen significantly in all targets and also shown in the bottom of figure [ fig : civ_pumped ] with the dashed line representing the expected ( 14 - 12 ) integrated flux for a given ( 14 - 3 ) integrated flux .",
    "if this emission is due to co , some process other than ly@xmath4 photo - excitation must be responsible .",
    "it is likely the result of c iv photo - excitation , which is capable of exciting the @xmath3=0 level of co @xcite .",
    "the resulting ( 0 - 3 ) transition creates a band of emission at 1712 - 1720  .",
    "cursory analysis shows that there is sufficient flux in the observed c iv lines to produce these levels of emission .",
    "in this paper , we have characterized uv photo - excited co emission in a sample of t tauri star spectra from the cos instrument on @xmath23 , reaching the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "electronic transitions of co are observed in approximately half of the t tauri stars surveyed , primarily due to photo - excitation by ly@xmath4 emission coincident with the @xmath0 - @xmath1 ( 14 - 0 ) absorption band .",
    "the resulting transitions from the @xmath3 = 14 state appear as emission bands between 1280   and 1712  .",
    "the ( 14 - 3 ) and ( 14 - 4 ) bands are most conducive to spectral modeling .    \\2 .",
    "the observed ly@xmath4 emission is not sufficient to reproduce the observed co band emission ; thus , we create a model to simulate the local ly@xmath4 radiation field incident on the co molecules . with two gaussian emission components created at the star , followed by outflow and ism absorbers , we are able to recreate the observed ly@xmath4 profiles and co band emission .    \\3 . for seven of the twelve targets , we measure co temperatures between @xmath16100 and 1500 k , and co column densities of @xmath82 - 10@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "both strong ly@xmath4 and co emission are required in order to constrain @xmath5 to within 0.5 dex ; for these 5 targets temperatures are below 600 k. the high-@xmath31 lines in several targets are narrow enough to constrain the co to outside 1 au .",
    "there are no strong correlations between our calculated @xmath5 and @xmath9 values and other previously determined parameters .",
    "our measured co temperatures are lower than previously measured ir - co and uv - h@xmath2 in cttss .",
    "the temperature differences , along with our calculated emission line widths , imply that the uv - co and ir - co are different populations .",
    "if the uv - co and uv - h@xmath2 are co - spatial , our @xmath5 values are 3 - 4 orders of magnitude greater than those expected from previously measured h@xmath2 abundances and dense cloud co / h@xmath2 ratios .",
    "further analysis of the h@xmath2 lines , as well as more detailed geometric modeling , is essential to understand the relationship between the uv - co , ir - co and h@xmath2    \\6 . co emission increases with @xmath10 because of the corresponding increase in the ly@xmath4 radiation field . upon correcting for @xmath10 ,",
    "there is still a correlation between co emission and age .",
    "we conclude that as cttss evolve and disk dust and h i clears , the ly@xmath4 photons are able to reach more co.    the authors thank jeff linsky and the anonymous referee for their helpful suggestions that improved the quality of the paper .",
