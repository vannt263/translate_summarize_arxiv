    "the last decade has been marked by a burst of interest in schramm - lwner evolution ( sle ) .",
    "sle has led to an elegant description of several 2d conformally invariant statistical physical systems at criticality by means of a solution to the initial value problem for a special differential equation with a random driving term given by 1d brownian motion .",
    "the origin of sle can be traced to the seminal schramm s paper @xcite , where he revisited the notion of scaling limit and conformal invariance for the loop erased random walk and the uniform spanning tree .",
    "this approach was developed in many further works and many lattice physical processes were proved to converge to sle with some specific diffusion factor , e.g. , percolation , ising model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , sle became an approach to conformal field theory which emphasizes cft s roots in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "we consider another setup in which the sample paths are represented by the trajectories of points ( e.g. , the origin ) in the unit disk @xmath0 evolving randomly under the generalized lwner equation .",
    "the driving mechanism differs from sle . in the sle case",
    "the denjoy - wolff attracting point ( @xmath1 in the chordal case or a boundary point of the unit disk in the radial case ) is fixed . in our case ,",
    "the attracting point is the driving mechanism and the denjoy - wolff point is different from it . in analytic terms",
    ", the generalized lwner evolution @xmath2 solves the initial value problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 is measurable and the driving function @xmath5 is a so - called herglotz function ( see section [ sec : genloew ] for the definition ) .    in the radial sle case @xmath6 and @xmath7 in our case @xmath8 , and the denjoy - wolff point is different from @xmath9 , and there is no common fixed point of the evolution .    even though the driving mechanism in our case differs from that of sle , the generated families of conformal maps still possess the important time - homogeneous markov property .",
    "in the deterministic case , section 3 , we thoroughly study a particular case when @xmath10 , @xmath11 . we give a complete description of the case of the evolution of mbius automorphisms of @xmath0 . in particular , we obtain the intervals of the constant @xmath12 in which the evolution is elliptic , hyperbolic and parabolic . in the general case of endomorphisms of @xmath0 we prove a sufficient condition of ellipticity of the dynamics for sufficient large @xmath12 .",
    "we also find values of the parameter @xmath12 for which the trajectories of a point are closed .",
    "the proposed model also describes deterministic and stochastic evolution of shapes in the complex plane .",
    "following @xcite , we understand by a _",
    "shape _ a simple closed smooth curve .",
    "the study of 2d shapes is one of the central problems in the field of computer vision .",
    "a program of such study and its importance was summarized by mumford at icm 2002 in beijing @xcite .",
    "however , we plan to focus on shape evolution in forthcoming papers .",
    "the central part of the paper , section 4 , is dedicated to a stochastic version of in which the driving term is @xmath8 , where @xmath13 is the standard 1-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the equation is reduced to an it 2d diffusion sde , which we solve explicitly in some cases .",
    "we calculate the infinitesimal generator which is given by the virasoro generators in a certain representation .",
    "we give estimates of growth of @xmath14 , calculate momenta , and describe the boundary diffusion on @xmath15 .",
    "so far , the only well - studied examples of the generalized lwner equation were the classical cases corresponding to @xmath16 ( radial lwner equation ) and @xmath17 ( chordal lwner equation ) .",
    "this paper is one of the first studies where examples of generalized lwner equation with non - constant attracting point @xmath18 are considered .",

    "the pioneering idea of lwner @xcite in 1923 contained two main ingredients : subordination chains and semigroups of conformal maps .",
    "this far - reaching program was created in the hopes to solve the bieberbach conjecture @xcite and the final proof of this conjecture by de  branges @xcite in 1984 was based on lwner s parametric method .",
    "the modern form of this method is due to kufarev @xcite and pommerenke @xcite .",
