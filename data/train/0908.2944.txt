    "in the 60s , some indications came up for a possible `` @xmath0 '' baryon resonance with strangeness @xmath1 , but the data on the kaon ",
    "nucleon interaction did not confirm the existence of this state .",
    "for references , see early issues of the review of particle properties , as cited in the last one  @xcite . in the modern language , such a @xmath0 resonance would be a @xmath2 state , where @xmath3 denotes a light quark @xmath4 or @xmath5 .    in the 70s",
    ", some excitement arose on baryonium candidates , tentatively interpreted as @xmath6 states with a separation between the @xmath7 diquark and the @xmath8 antidiquark , and possibly an exotic color charge for these diquarks , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it was then suggested that multiquark baryons could exist as well , with a structure @xmath9 , and again , a possible orbital barrier between the clusters and perhaps a color - octet content of each cluster , this preventing from immediate rearrangement and subsequent decay into two color - singlet hadrons  @xcite .",
    "this work was abandoned when the evidence for baryonium faded away .    in 1977 , jaffe suggested that the dibaryon @xmath10 could be bound below the lowest threshold @xmath11 due to a coherence in the chromomagnetic interaction  @xcite . in 1987 , lipkin  @xcite and , independently , gignoux et al .",
    "@xcite , pointed out that the same mechanism would bind a heavy pentaquark ( the word was invented in these circumstances ) such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "this pentaquark was searched for in an experiment at fermilab @xcite , which turned out not conclusive .",
    "further works indicated that the stability of @xmath15 and @xmath16 hardly survives a more consistent treatment of the short - range correlations which enter the chromomagnetic matrix elements and the breaking of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry in the light quark sector @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown  @xcite that in some models of chiral dynamics , new baryons are predicted , in particular an antidecuplet above the usual octet @xmath17 and decuplet @xmath18 .",
    "this triggered a search by nakano et al .",
    "( leps collaboration )  @xcite , who found evidence for a baryon with strangeness @xmath1 .",
    "much confusion followed , as stressed in  @xcite , where a critical review can be found , with skeptical remarks not so much on the pioneering theoretical speculation and experimental search , but on the followers .",
    "see , also , @xcite .",
    "indeed , custom models were quickly designed , where the pentaquark was found with either positive and negative parity , made of ad - hoc quark clusters .",
    "several experimentalists discovered the potential of their set - up and stored data for looking at exotics and hastily constructed mass spectra that could have been investigated much earlier .",
    "eventually , experiments with high statistics and good particle identification found no confirmation of the pentaquark candidates  @xcite .",
    "there is now reasonable consensus that the light pentaquark does not exist , though some puzzling positive indications are still reported  @xcite .",
    "for a recent discussion , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the question of multiquarks remains important . on the experimental side",
    ", several states have been discovered in the hidden - charm sector  @xcite , whose properties suggest large @xmath19 components , where @xmath20 is light or strange . on the theoretical sides ,",
    "multiquark states are now studied with the qcd sum rules  @xcite and the lattice qcd @xcite . in the past ,",
    "the issue of multiquark states was mostly the field of constituent models : in principle , the basic ingredients can be tuned by fitting the spectrum of ordinary mesons and baryons , and then applied to tentative multiquark configurations .",
    "but the main difficulty lies in extrapolating the potential from the meson sector to larger systems . for the coulomb - like part , in particular one - gluon exchange , the color additive rule @xmath21 is probably justified . here",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the 8-vector color generator of the @xmath23 quark ( with a suitable change for the antiquark ) and the normalization is such that @xmath24 holds for a color - singlet quark ",
    "antiquark meson .",
    "however , there is no reason to use additive rule ( [ eq : col - add ] ) for the confining part , although it has been often adopted as a tentative approximation . for baryons ,",
    "a @xmath25-shape interaction has been suggested years ago  @xcite , and often rediscovered either in models or in attempts to solve the qcd in the strong coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "this interaction is now confirmed by lattice qcd @xcite ( for further refs . , see .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it reads @xmath26 where each quark is linked to a junction @xmath27 whose location is optimized , as in the famous problem of fermat and torricelli .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : y ] . instead , the rule ( [ eq : col - add ] ) with @xmath28 would give a potential @xmath29 which is smaller but very close to @xmath30 , so that the phenomenology hardly distinguishes between the two potentials @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "in the case of tetraquarks ( two quarks and two antiquarks ) , however , it was shown that the color - additive rule ( [ eq : col - add ] ) and the generalization of the @xmath25-shape potential lead to rather different spectra . in the former case",
    ", the stability of the tetraquarks @xmath32 requires a large mass ratio for the quarks and antiquarks . the latter potential , if alone and acting without any antisymmetrization constraint ( e.g. , with quarks and antiquarks of different flavors ) , gives stable tetraquarks  @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark potential was taken as the minimum energy of two separate quark ",
    "antiquark flux tubes ( the so - called `` flip - flop '' interaction ) and a connected double-@xmath25 steiner tree linking the quarks to the antiquarks , a model of confinement which is supported by lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "our aim is to extend the study of vijande et al .",
    "to pentaquark states .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the constituents have the same mass , but remain distinguishable through their spin and flavor degrees of freedom , so that the orbital wave function can contain a symmetric component .",
    "we also consider the case where one of the constituents is infinitely massive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is described in sec .",
    "[ se : model ] .",
    "the results are shown in sec .",
    "[ se : resu ] , and some further investigations are suggested in sec .",
    "[ se : out ] .",
    "we focus on the role of confining forces , and hence disregard the coulomb - like contributions and spin - dependent forces . for @xmath33 mesons , the hamiltonian of the relative motion reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is conjugate to the quark  antiquark separation @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the constituent mass . for this system and the ones considered below , it is possible to set @xmath39 without loss of generality , since departing from these values results in a simple scale factor @xmath40 of all the eigenvalues .",
    "the ground - state @xmath33 of ( [ eq : hmes ] ) can be expressed in terms of the airy function , and its energy is @xmath41 . for @xmath42 or @xmath43 with a static quark or antiquark , and a constituent of mass @xmath44 ,",
    "the reduced mass is twice larger , and by scaling the ground - state energy is @xmath45    for @xmath46 baryons , we consider first the additive model ( [ eq : vhalf ] ) , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are jacobi variables suited for equal masses , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 their conjugate momenta .",
    "we also study the more realistic @xmath25-shape interaction ( [ eq : vy ] ) , schematically pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : y ] , with the hamiltonian @xmath52     ( coloer on line ) confinement of mesons and baryons .",
    "the minimum over the quark permutations gives the flip  flop potential . ]    for @xmath53 , the kinetic - energy part is replaced by @xmath54 .",
    "for the five - body problem with equal masses , we start , as in  @xcite , from a symmetrized model @xmath55 where the cumulated strength encountered in a meson and in a baryon within the additive model is spread over the 10 interacting pairs . here ,",
    "the relative motion is described by four jacobi variables @xmath56 , to be specified shortly , and the @xmath57 are their conjugate momenta . up to an irrelevant factor ,",
    "the potential in ( [ eq : h5 ] ) is identical to the confining interaction adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that , in the additive model , the threshold can be understood as another five - body problem , @xmath58\\sum_{3\\le i < j } r_{ij}+ \\frac{2\\,\\epsilon}{3}\\sum_{3\\le i } ( r_{1i}+r_{2i})~,\\ ] ] in the limit where @xmath59",
    ". then the variational principle applied to @xmath60 with the symmetric ground - state of @xmath61 as trial function immediately indicates that the lowest energy of @xmath61 is _ above _ the threshold . in other words , in the color - additive model ( [ eq : col - add ] ) , the most asymmetric distribution of couplings is encountered in a threshold made of two separate color singlets , and this asymmetry benefits the threshold and penalizes tentative multiquarks .",
    "this is confirmed by the results of hiyama et al .",
    "@xcite . to build stable multiquarks",
    ", one can either introduce a competing asymmetry by using different constituent masses , as done for the tetraquark @xmath62 , or modify the color - additive model  @xcite .    for the pentaquark",
    ", we consider the natural extension of the minimal - path model already used for the tetraquark  @xcite and supported by lattice studies @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath63 where @xmath64~,\\ ] ] with @xmath65 being any permutation of @xmath66 , is the so - called flip  flop potential .",
    "it corresponds to the most economical configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : y ] .",
    "the second term , @xmath67 , corresponds to a connected steiner tree , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : steiner5 ] .",
    "this steiner tree generalizes the fermat ",
    "torricelli problem for more than three points .",
    "the quarks @xmath68 are linked to the central steiner point @xmath69 as three quarks in an ordinary baryon , through an intermediate steiner point @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , @xmath71 form a baryon - like structure with steiner point @xmath72 . then , the antiquark and the two intermediate steiner points @xmath70 and @xmath72 form an antibaryon - like configuration .",
    "of course , the potential @xmath67 is optimized by varying the permutation @xmath65 of the quarks .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for references on the steiner problem and its application to the multiquark potential .",
    "note that the long - range part of the pentaquark potential , as estimated in lattice qcd , has been found fully compatible with this multi-@xmath25 term @xcite .",
    "( color on line ) example of connected steiner tree ( planar for simplicity ) linking the antiquark @xmath73 to the quarks @xmath74 .",
    "the steiner points are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath75 . ]",
    "an obvious consequence of the minimization of ( [ eq : vp ] ) is that @xmath76 indicating that the pentaquark potential is smaller than the cumulated confinement energy of the threshold , i.e. , that the effective potential between the meson @xmath77 and the baryon @xmath78 is attractive .",
    "however , in three space dimensions , an attractive potential does not automatically lead to binding , if this potential is short - ranged .",
    "hence one should solve the five - body problem to determine whether this model supports or not a stable pentaquark .    in the case of the tetraquark , it was noticed  @xcite that the connected steiner tree configuration , though the most interesting , plays a minor role , and that the binding is obtained from the flip ",
    "flop term alone .",
    "similarly , a survey with randomly generated coordinates for the antiquark and the four quarks shows that , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vp ] ) , the steiner tree gives the minimum in less than @xmath79 of the cases .",
    "hence , we shall neglect this term and compute an upper bound with the flip - flop interaction alone .",
    "this is opposite to the choice made in @xcite , where only the connected - steiner - tree term is adopted and the flip ",
    "flop one omitted .",
    "the ground - state meson can be described by a simple expansion @xmath80 or , in short , @xmath81 , and the energy @xmath41 can be reproduced with just a few terms .",
    "the relevant matrix elements @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are known analytically , and are basic ingredients for more complicated systems .    for the ground - state of @xmath85 , a generalization reads @xmath86~,\\ ] ] and , again , the matrix elements are known analytically . for a given choice of range parameters , the weights @xmath87",
    "are given by a generalized eigenvalue equation .",
    "to avoid ambiguities and simplify the minimization , one can restrict the gaussians to scalar ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) or diagonal ( @xmath90 , @xmath89 ) matrices , and those given by permutation of the quarks ; furthermore the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be taken from a single set @xmath93 , with minimization only over the two extreme values  @xcite .",
    "one reaches @xmath94 .",
    "if only scalar matrices are allowed , the expansion ( [ eq : gauss3 ] ) converges towards the best function of the hyperradius given by @xmath95 . in this approximation , @xmath96 is given by the radial equation @xmath97 with suitable boundary conditions , which leads to the upper bound @xmath98 .",
    "the hyperscalar projection , including the strength factor @xmath99 and the number of pairs , is @xmath100 a similar strategy can be used for the @xmath25-shape potential , except that the matrix elements have to be calculated numerically .",
    "the hyperscalar coefficient becomes @xmath101 . by scaling from ( [ eq : hypercoff3 ] ) , this corresponds to an energy @xmath102 .",
    "the gaussian expansion , if not restricted to scalar matrices , gives a better energy @xmath103 .",
    "this means that , in our simple string model , the threshold for the stability of light pentaquark states is @xmath104 if a static quark @xmath105 or antiquark @xmath106 is introduced , for @xmath107 , the threshold consists of @xmath108 , and for @xmath109 , it is the lowest of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which turns out to be the latter by a small margin , and the thresholds are @xmath112 we now turn to the five - body problem , first for @xmath113 . a possible choice of jacobi variables , besides the center - of - mass , is @xmath114 which is convenient to express the permutations of the quarks . with a gaussian expansion , one obtains for the symmetric toy model @xmath61 an energy @xmath115 . in the hyperscalar approximation ,",
    "the radial equation is similar to ( [ eq : hyper3 ] ) with now a centrifugal coefficient @xmath116 instead of 15/4 , and a strength @xmath117 , and a very similar energy is found .",
    "this model @xmath61 has thus energies well above the threshold @xmath118 that includes pairwise forces for the baryon , and even above the threshold @xmath119 when the baryon is bound by the @xmath25-shape interaction .",
    "if now one switches to the flip  flop interaction , the coefficient of the hyperscalar potential @xmath120 is found to be @xmath121 , by numerical integration of @xmath122 over the hyperscalar variables , for given @xmath123 . by scaling ,",
    "this gives an energy @xmath124 in the hyperscalar approximation , which is clearly _ below _ the dissociation threshold ( [ eq : threshold ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the gaussian expansion .",
    "as these two methods are variational , the flip - flop model gives a bound state , and this is _ a fortiori _ the case if the connected steiner trees are also included in evaluating the potential ( [ eq : vp ] ) .",
    "if the calculation is repeated in the case of four unit masses and an infinitely massive antiquark or quark , the kinetic energy in ( [ eq : vp ] ) is replaced by @xmath125 , where @xmath57 is conjugate to the position @xmath126 of a finite - mass constituent . the pairwise model ( [ eq : h5 ] ) gives an energy of about 6.305 for both @xmath107 and @xmath109 in the hyperscalar approximation ,",
    "i.e. , well above the threshold , and also with the gaussian expansion , no state is found below the threshold . on the other hand",
    ", the flip  flop potential , treated in the hyperscalar approximation , gives @xmath127 which is sufficient to demonstrate the of stability of @xmath107 and @xmath109 with respect to their respective thresholds  ( [ eq : th - qqqqq ] ) .",
    "a simple string model of linear confinement gives a pentaquark which is stable against spontaneous dissociation into a meson and an isolated baryon .",
    "this is at variance with most of the earlier constituent - model calculations .",
    "there are , however , severe limitations in our approach :    * the non - relativistic kinematics for the quarks and the born  oppenheimer treatment of the gluon field , which supposedly readjusts itself immediately when the constituent move , call for an application to heavy quarks .",
    "however , the short - range central corrections should be incorporated for heavy quarks . for the coulomb - like interaction , the color - additive rule ( [ eq : col - add ] ) probably holds .",
    "if alone , a coulomb interaction with color factors will not bind .",
    "our pure confining model binds .",
    "what occurs for a superposition would be a matter of detailed phenomenology beyond the scope of the present note .",
    "* the quark wave function is assumed to be compatible with an overall s - wave , and is symmetric under permutations .",
    "thus , it should be associated with enough spin and flavor degrees of freedom in the quark sector .",
    "a proper treatment of the fermi statistics of quarks is rather delicate in the flip  flop or steiner - tree model , as different flux tube topologies correspond to different color couplings , and thus different constraints for the spin , flavor and space parts of the wave - function . *",
    "the calculation has been restricted to five equal and finite masses , or one infinitely massive constituent surrounded by four equal masses .",
    "the property of stability was found to survive for both @xmath107 and @xmath109 .",
    "the investigation should be extended with better variational wave functions , and a larger variety of mass distributions for the constituents .",
    "clearly the configuration @xmath128 and its analogs by permuting the light quarks or by replacing @xmath129 by @xmath130 would deserve a refined treatment including the spin  spin forces , which are favorable @xcite .",
    "* the pentaquark states with two or more heavy constituents would deserve a specific studies . for @xmath131 baryons ,",
    "the dynamics can be studied in the born ",
    "oppenheimer approximation , where the two heavy quarks experience an effective interaction resulting from their direct interaction modified by the light quark @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath62 tetraquarks and the @xmath132 or @xmath133 pentaquarks could be studied through in the adiabatic limit .",
    "it remains that our conclusion , based on the flip  flop dynamics , is drastically different from the one obtained from the connected steiner tree alone @xcite .",
    "studies within the lattice qcd @xcite or , more recently , the ads / qcd  @xcite , have analyzed the interplay between flip  flop and connected multi-@xmath25 configurations for tetraquarks .",
    "it would be desirable to have more information about the analogue for pentaquarks ."
