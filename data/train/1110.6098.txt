    "this self - generated dipole environment possesses an infinite number of degrees of freedom and thus serves as the thermostat itself , dominating over the usual relaxation mechanism via phonons , which becomes inefficient at low temperatures .",
    "indeed , in highly disordered materials the standard electron - phonon interaction via a deformation potential should produce phonons with wavelength on the order of the electron wavelength @xmath5 , which , in its turn , is on the order of the localization length . in granular materials or jjas the role of the localization length",
    "is taken by the granule size ( superconducting granules in the case of a jja ) .",
    "thus the characteristic phonon energy is @xmath6 , and the corresponding phonon temperature is @xmath7 which for typical localization lengths on the order of 10 nm is about 10k . at temperatures @xmath8 relaxation via phonons becomes inefficient and gives way to _ non - phonon _ mechanisms .",
