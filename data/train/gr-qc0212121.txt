    "the gravitational vlbi experiment for measuring the relativistic effect of propagation of gravity field of orbiting jupiter was conducted on september 8 , 2002 by the national radio astronomical observatory ( usa ) and the max plank institute for radio astronomy ( germany ) .",
    "the idea of the experiment was proposed by kopeikin @xcite who had noted that an arbitrary - moving gravitating body deflects light not instantaneously but with retardation caused by the finite speed of gravity propagating from the body to the light ray .",
    "this is because positions of the gravitating bodies are connected to the light - ray particle by the gravity null cone which is defined by the equation for the retarded time in the gravitational _ linard - wiechert _ potentials being solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "the goal of the experiment was to confirm this prediction by making use of the close celestial alignment of jupiter and the quasar j0842 + 1835 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to make use of the parameterized post - newtonian technique to reveal how the gravity propagation affects the light - ray trajectory .",
    "this approach allows us to confirm our previous theoretical results @xcite by looking at the problem from different position .",
    "the problem is formulated as follows .",
    "light ray is emitted by a quasar ( qso j0842 + 1835 ) at the time @xmath1 and moves to the network of vlbi stations located on the earth .",
    "as light moves , it passes through the variable gravitational field of the solar system , created by the orbital motion of sun and other massive planets , and is received by the first and second vlbi stations at the times @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "gravitational field of the solar system causes delay in the time of propagation of radio signals  the effect discovered by @xcite in static gravitational field approximation .",
    "we noted @xcite that the present - day accuracy of phase - reference vlbi measurements is sufficient to detect a 1.5 post - newtonian , and 1.5 post - newtonian correction to the newtonian gravity is of order @xmath4 . ]",
    "correction to the shapiro time delay incorporated implicitly into position of the light - ray deflecting body ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) which must be taken at the retarded instant of time related to the time of observation by the equation of the gravity null - cone .",
    "we solved the einstein - maxwell system of differential equations and calculated this correction for jupiter by making use of the post - minkowskian approximation @xcite with the retarded _ linard - wiechert _ solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "the retardation is caused by the finite speed of propagation of gravity @xmath5 which , as we have revealed in @xcite , enters the 1.5 post - newtonian correction to the shapiro time delay .",
    "hence , we concluded that the vlbi experiment on september 8 , 2002 is sensitive to the effect of the _ propagation of gravity _ and can be used to measure its speed .",
    "our primary paper @xcite has given no particular details on the parameterization of the gravity propagation effect the amplitude of which was characterized by the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason the physical meaning of the gravity propagation effect was not understood adequately by some researchers @xcite . by scrutiny inspection we found that @xcite made an erroneous use of insufficient 1.0 post - newtonian ( static ) approximation to discuss the high - order 1.5 post - newtonian ( dynamic ) correction to the shapiro time delay while @xcite gave analysis of the problem of propagation of light ray in the time - dependent gravitational field of the solar system on the basis of the ppn formalism which was not sufficiently elaborated to tackle properly the 1.5 post - newtonian approximation to general relativity ( see appendix [ a2 ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we extend our theoretical analysis of the vlbi experiment by proving that the parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the speed of light and @xmath0 is the speed of gravity .",
    "parameter @xmath6 is a measurable quantity and its determination will provided us with the numerical estimate of the magnitude of the propagation of gravity effect in terms of the speed of gravity @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum of plausible values of @xmath0 ranges from @xmath5 in general relativity to @xmath9 as advocated by @xcite .",
    "the vlbi experiment gives @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath11 however are unlikely and ruled out , for example , by observations of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the linearized einstein equations and the speed - of - gravity parameterization that is used in section 3 for derivation of the post - newtonian metric tensor .",
    "section 4 deals with the post - newtonian time delay formula for light propagation .",
    "the effect of retardation of gravity in the gravitational time delay is explained in section 5 .",
    "the differential vlbi time delay is derived in section 6 where we prove that our previous post - minkowskian formulation of the vlbi delay is identical with the post - newtonian presentation .",

    "this implies that partial time derivatives of the metric tensor perturbation @xmath38 in the left side of the einstein equations ( [ ee ] ) must be parametrically associated with the speed @xmath0 .",
    "this will lead to the wave operator depending explicitly on the speed of gravity @xmath0 considered as a parameter .",

    "this assumes that the smooth transition from @xmath8 to @xmath0 in the left part of eqs .",

    "( [ wi1 ] ) , ( [ wi2 ] ) are not einstein equations and are written in a particular gauge which was not clearly described .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the field equations ( [ wi1 ] ) , ( [ wi2 ] ) are , in fact , disconnected from the light geodesic equations . indeed , assuming that @xmath39 and using a single time scale @xmath18 imply that vacuum must be considered as having a `` refractive '' index @xmath165 and the equations of light propagation should have extra terms proportional to @xmath166 @xcite that were not discussed in @xcite .",
    "the whole problem of the unambiguous interpretation of the vlbi experiment under discussion is , in fact , a matter of construction of a self - consistent bi - metric theory of gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "the ppn formalism @xcite can not play a role of such a theory as it consists of a set of plausible but , in any other aspect , disconnected assumptions about how gravity and electromagnetic fields behave if general theory of relativity is violated .",
    "there are two other concerns about validity of the calculations given by will @xcite .",
    "the first concern relates to the meaning of the retarded time @xmath167 in the arguments of the bodies @xmath168",
    ". will insists ( see appendix of @xcite ) that coefficients of the taylor expansion @xmath169 must be understood as taken at the time @xmath170 .",
    "this contradicts to the definition of the taylor expansion given in any mathematical textbook . by definition of the taylor expansion the coefficients @xmath171 and @xmath172 in the formula given above",
    "are taken at the retarded time @xmath173 .",
    "this instant of time can coincide with that @xmath170 , if and only if , the retarded time equation @xmath174 has a solution @xmath173 . from the astronomical point of view",
    "it means that the light ray must pass through the light - ray deflecting body .",
    "this is indeed coincides with what is shown in the figure of will s paper .",
    "however , in the relativistic vlbi experiment on september 8 , 2002 light was passing pretty far away from jupiter at the distance of about @xmath175 jovian radii ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath170 the time @xmath176 in the vlbi experiment .",
    "the second concern relates to the definition of the point of the closest approach of the light ray to the moving body . after removing the misinterpretation of the taylor expansion in @xcite one",
    "has to understand that will has _ postulated _ that the point of the closest approach is reached by light at the instant of the retarded time @xmath173",
    ". will also _ postulated _ that at the point of the closest approach the light - ray - propagation unit vector @xmath177 and that of the impact parameter @xmath178 must be orthogonal in the euclidean sense .",
    "we emphasize that the point of the closest approach of light ray to the body must be found after solution of the corresponding equation giving the distance between the body and the light particle as a function of time , let say , @xmath179 . finding the minimum of this function from the condition @xmath180 , shows that at the point of the closest approach the two vectors @xmath177 and @xmath181 are not orthogonal and their euclidean dot product is proportional to the relativistic terms of order @xmath182 which are important in the subsequent calculations of the time delay .",
    "all such terms are absent in @xcite that along with the previous our comments casts strong doubts on the validity of will s calculations and his interpretation of the relativistic vlbi experiment conducted by fomalont and kopeikin @xcite .",
