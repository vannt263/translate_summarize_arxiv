    "codes  @xcite are a family of codes that achieve capacity on binary , memoryless , symmetric ( bms ) channels and have low - complexity construction , encoding , and decoding algorithms . this is the setting we consider .",
    "polar codes have since been extended to a variety of settings including source - coding  @xcite , non - binary channels  @xcite , asymmetric channels  @xcite , channels with memory  @xcite , and more .",
    "the probability of error of polar codes is given by a union of correlated error events .",
    "the union bound , which ignores this correlation , is used to upper - bound the error probability . in this work ,",
    "we exploit the correlation between error events to develop a general method for lower - bounding the probability of error of polar codes .",
    "polar codes are based on an iterative construction that transforms @xmath0 identical and independent channel uses into `` good '' and `` bad '' channels .",
    "the `` good '' channels are almost noiseless , whereas the `` bad '' channels are almost pure noise .",
    "arikan showed  @xcite that for every @xmath1 , as @xmath2 the proportion of channels with capacity greater than @xmath3 tends to the channel capacity @xmath4 and the proportion of channels with capacity less than @xmath5 tends to @xmath6 .",
    "the polar construction begins with two identical and independent copies of a bms @xmath7 and transforms them into two new channels , @xmath8 channel @xmath9 is a better channel than @xmath7 whereas channel @xmath10 is worse than @xmath7 .",
    "can be stochastically degraded to channel @xmath7 , which in turn can be stochastically degraded to @xmath10 .",
    "] this construction can be repeated multiple times ; each time we take two identical copies of a channel , say @xmath9 and @xmath9 , and polarize them , e.g. , to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we call the operation @xmath13 a ` @xmath14'-transform , and the operation @xmath15 a ` @xmath16'-transform",
    ".    there are @xmath0 possible combinations of @xmath17 ` @xmath14'- and ` @xmath16'-transforms ; we define channel @xmath18 as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 be the binary expansion of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the most significant bit ( msb ) .",
    "then , channel @xmath18 is obtained by @xmath17 transforms of @xmath7 according to the sequence @xmath22 , starting with the msb : if @xmath23 we do a ` @xmath14'-transform and if @xmath24 we do a ` @xmath16'-transform .",
    "for example , if @xmath25 , channel @xmath26 is @xmath27 , i.e. , it first undergoes a ` @xmath16'-transform and then two ` @xmath14'-transforms .",
    "overall , we obtain @xmath28 channels @xmath29 ; channel @xmath18 has input @xmath30 and output @xmath31 .",
    "i.e. , channel @xmath18 has binary input @xmath30 , output that consists of the output and input of channel @xmath32 , and assumes that the input bits of future channels @xmath33 are uniform .",
    "we call these _ synthetic channels_. one then determines which synthetic channels are `` good '' and which are `` bad '' , and transmits information over the `` good '' synthetic channels and predetermined values over the `` bad '' synthetic channels . since the values transmitted over the latter are predetermined , we call the `` bad '' synthetic channels _ frozen_.    decoding is accomplished via the successive - cancellation ( sc ) decoder",
    ". it decodes the synthetic channels in succession , using previous bit decisions as part of the output .",
    "the bit decision for a synthetic channel is either based on its likelihood or , if it is frozen , on its predetermined value .",
    "i.e. , denoting the set of non - frozen synthetic channels by @xmath34 , @xmath35 where we denoted @xmath36 and similarly for the previous bit decisions @xmath37 .",
    "as non - frozen synthetic channels are almost noiseless , previous bit decisions are assumed to be correct .",
    "thus , when @xmath28 is sufficiently large , this scheme can be shown to achieve capacity  @xcite as the proportion of almost noiseless channels is @xmath4 .    to analyze the performance of polar codes , let @xmath38 denote the event that channel @xmath18 errs under sc decoding while channels @xmath39 do not .",
    "i.e. , @xmath40 the probability of error of polar codes under sc decoding is given by @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the event that channel @xmath18 errs given that a genie had revealed to it the true previous bits , i.e. @xmath43 we call an sc decoder with access to genie - provided previous bits a _ genie - aided decoder_. some thought reveals that @xmath44 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.1 ) or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) ) .",
    "thus , the probability of error of polar codes under sc decoding is equivalently given by @xmath45 . in the sequel",
    "we assume a genie - aided decoder .    the events @xmath46 are disjoint but difficult to analyze .",
    "the events @xmath42 are easier to analyze , but are no longer disjoint . a straightforward upper bound for @xmath47 is the union bound : @xmath48 this bound facilitated the analysis of  @xcite .",
    "an important question is how tight this upper bound is . to this end ,",
    "one approach is to develop a lower bound to @xmath49 , which is what we pursue in this work .",
    "a trivial lower bound on a union is @xmath50 better lower bounds may be obtained by considering pairs of error events : @xmath51 via the inclusion - exclusion principle , one can combine lower bounds on multiple pairs of error events to obtain a better lower bound  @xcite @xmath52 this can also be cast in terms of unions of error events using @xmath53 .    to our knowledge , to date",
    "there have been two attempts to compute a lower bound on the performance of the sc decoder , both based on  .",
    "the first attempt was in  @xcite , using a density evolution approach , and the second attempt in  @xcite applies only to the bec .",
    "we briefly introduce these below , but first we explain where the difficulty lies .    the probability @xmath54 is given by an appropriate functional of the probability distribution of synthetic channel @xmath18",
    ". however , the output alphabet of @xmath18 is very large .",
    "if the output alphabet of @xmath7 is @xmath55 then the output alphabet of @xmath18 has size @xmath56 .",
    "this quickly grows unwieldy , recalling that @xmath57 .",
    "it is infeasible to store this probability distribution and it must be approximated .",
    "such approximations are the subject of  @xcite ; they enable one to compute upper and lower bounds on various functionals of the synthetic channel @xmath18 .    to compute probabilities of unions of events ,",
    "one must know the joint distribution of two synthetic channels .",
    "the size of the joint distribution s output alphabet is the product of each synthetic channel s alphabet size , rendering the joint distribution infeasible to store .",
    "the authors of  @xcite suggested to approximate the joint distribution of pairs of synthetic channels using a density evolution approach .",
    "this provides an iterative method to compute the joint distribution , but does not address the problem of the amount of memory required to store it .",
    "practical implementation of density evolution must involve quantization  ( * ? ? ? * appendix b ) .",
    "the probability of error derived from quantized joint distributions approximates , but does not generally bound , the real probability of error . for the special case of the bec , as noted and analyzed in  @xcite , no quantization is needed , as the polar transform of a bec is a bec .",
    "thus , they were able to precisely compute the probabilities of unions of error events of descendants of a bec using density evolution .",
    "the same bounds for the bec were developed in  @xcite using a different approach , again relying on the property that the polar transform of a bec is a bec .",
    "the authors were able to track the joint probability of erasure during the polarization process .",
    "furthermore , they were able to show that the union bound is asymptotically tight for the bec .",
    "in this work , we develop an algorithm to compute lower bounds on the joint probability of error of two synthetic channels @xmath58 .",
    "our technique is general , and applies to synthetic channels that are polar descendants of any bms channel .",
    "we use these bounds in   to lower - bound the probability of error of polar codes . for the special case of the bec",
    ", we recover the results of  @xcite and  @xcite using our bounds .",
    "our method is based on approximating the joint distribution with a stochastically upgraded joint distribution that has a smaller output alphabet .",
    "the difficulty is that key ideas that are true for single channels no longer apply to joint distributions .",
    "for example , a degrading operation on a joint distribution may _ improve _ the performance of an sc decoder .",
    "as another example , a sufficient statistic for a single synthetic channel is not a sufficient statistic for the joint distribution : two symbols that are indistinguishable for one synthetic channel may have very different meanings for future synthetic channels .",
    "therefore , we develop methods that in one sense decouple the two synthetic channels yet in another sense couple them even further .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of our method , and lay out the groundwork for the sections that follow . we aim to produce a lower bound on the probability of error of two synthetic channels .",
    "since we can not know the precise joint distribution , we must approximate it .",
    "the approximation is rooted in stochastic degradation .",
    "degradation is a partial ordering of channels .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be two channels .",
    "we say that @xmath7 is ( stochastically ) degraded with respect to @xmath61 , denoted @xmath62 , when there exists some channel @xmath63 such that @xmath64 if @xmath7 is degraded with respect to @xmath61 then @xmath61 is upgraded with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "degradation implies an ordering on the probability of error of the channels  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) : if @xmath65 then @xmath66 .",
    "this is true only when the decoder used is the optimal decoder .",
    "the notion of degradation readily extends to joint channels .",
    "we say that joint channel @xmath67 via some degrading channel @xmath68 if @xmath69 as for the single channel case , if @xmath70 then @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the probability of error of the optimal decoder for the joint channel .",
    "indeed our approach will be to approximate the joint synthetic channel with an upgraded joint channel with smaller output alphabet .",
    "there is a snag , however : this ordering of error probabilities does not hold , in general , for suboptimal decoders .",
    "the sc decoder , used for polar codes , is suboptimal . in the genie - aided case , which we consider here ,",
    "it is equivalent to performing a maximum likelihood decision on each marginal separately .",
    "we shall demonstrate the suboptimality of the sc decoder in .",
    "then , we will develop a different decoding criterion whose performance lower - bounds the sc decoder performance and is ordered by degradation . while in general this decoder requires an exhaustive search , for the special case of polar codes this decoder is easily found .",
    "it does , however , imply a special structure for the degrading channel , which we use to our advantage .",
    "we investigate the joint distribution of two synthetic channels in .",
    "we first bring it to a more convenient form that will be used in the sequel .",
    "then , we explain how to polarize a joint synthetic channel distribution and explore some consequences of symmetry .",
    "further consequences of symmetry are the subject of , in which we transform the channel to another form that greatly simplifies the steps that follow .",
    "this form exposes the inherent structure of the joint distribution .",
    "how to actually upgrade joint distributions is the subject of .",
    "we upgrade the joint distribution in two ways ; each upgrades one marginal without changing the other .",
    "we can not simply upgrade the marginals , as we must consider the joint distribution as a whole .",
    "this is where the above - mentioned methods of coupling - decoupling come into play .",
    "we present our algorithm for lower - bounding the probability of error of polar codes in .",
    "this algorithm is based on the building blocks presented in the previous sections .",
    "we demonstrate our algorithm with some numerical results in .",
    "we denote by @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "we use an iverson - style notation ( see  @xcite ) for indicator ( characteristic ) functions .",
    "i.e. , for a logical expression @xmath75 , @xmath76 is @xmath77 whenever @xmath75 is not true and is @xmath78 otherwise .",
    "we assume that the indicator function takes precedence whenever it appears , e.g. , @xmath79 is @xmath77 for @xmath80 .",
    "in this section , we tackle decoding of two dependent channels .",
    "we explain how this differs from the case of decoding a single channel , and dispel some misconceptions that may arise .",
    "we then specialize the discussion to polar codes .",
    "we explain the difficulty with combining the sc decoder with degradation procedures , and develop a different decoding criterion instead .",
    "finally , we develop a special structure for the degrading channel that , combined with the decoding criterion , implies ordering of probability of error by degradation .      a decoder for channel @xmath81 is a mapping @xmath82 that maps every output sequence @xmath83 to some @xmath84 .",
    "the average probability of error of the decoder for equiprobable inputs is given by @xmath85 the decoder is deterministic for symbols @xmath86 where @xmath87 assumes only the values @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for some symbols , however , we allow the decoder to make a random decision . if @xmath88 for some @xmath89 , then @xmath72 is the same whether @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the probability of error is insensitive to the resolution of ties .",
    "we denote the error event of a decoder by @xmath92 it is dependent on the decoder , i.e. , @xmath93 ; we suppress this to avoid cumbersome notation . clearly , @xmath94 .    the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoder , well known to minimize @xmath72 when the input bits are equiprobable , is defined by @xmath95 the ml decoder is not unique , as it does not define how ties are resolved .",
    "we now consider two _ dependent _ binary - input channels , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , with joint distribution @xmath98 .",
    "the optimal decoder for the joint channel considers both outputs together and makes a decision for both inputs jointly ; its probability of error is @xmath99 . rather than jointly decoding the input bits based on the joint output",
    ", we may opt to decode each channel separately .",
    "i.e. , the decoder of channel @xmath100 bases its decision solely on @xmath101 and completely ignores @xmath102 and vice versa .",
    "what are the optimal decoders @xmath103 and @xmath104 ? the answer depends on the criterion of optimality .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the error event of channel @xmath18 under some decoder @xmath105 .",
    "if we wish to minimize each individual channel s probability of error , we set each decoder as the ml decoder for the respective channel .",
    "we call this the _ individual maximum likelihood _ ( iml ) decoder , and denote its probability of error by @xmath106 .",
    "another criterion is to minimize @xmath107 , the probability that at least one of the decoders makes an error .",
    "we call the decoder that minimizes this probability using individual decoders for each channel the _ individual minimum joint @xmath72 _ ( imjp ) decoder . the event @xmath108 is not the same as the error event of the optimal decoder for the joint channel , even when the individual decoders turn out to be ml decoders",
    ". this is because we decode each input bit separately using only a portion of the joint output .",
    "clearly , @xmath109 the three decoders in   successively use less information for their decisions .",
    "the optimal decoder uses both outputs jointly as well as knowledge of the joint probability distribution ; the imjp decoder retains the knowledge of the joint distribution , but uses each output separately ; finally , the iml decoder dispenses with the joint distribution and operates as if the marginals are independent channels .",
    "[ ex_joint bms where p(eml1ueml2 ) is not optimal ] the conditional distribution @xmath110 of some joint channel is given in .",
    "the marginals are channels @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the optimal decoder for the joint channel chooses , for each output pair , the input pair with the highest probability ; it achieves @xmath113 .",
    "it is easily verified that the ml decoders of the marginals decide that the input is @xmath77 when @xmath78 is received and vice versa ; thus , @xmath114 .",
    "if we change the decoder of channel @xmath115 to always declare @xmath77 , regardless of the output , then @xmath116 . by checking all combinations of decoders @xmath117 , it can be verified that this is indeed the minimum value of @xmath118 . as expected ,   holds .",
    "we now demonstrate that the probability of error of suboptimal decoders is not ordered by degradation . to this end",
    ", we degrade the joint channel in by merging the output symbols @xmath119 into a new symbol , @xmath120 and @xmath121 into a new symbol , @xmath122 . denote the new joint channel @xmath123 .",
    "for each of the marginals , the ml decoder declares @xmath77 upon receipt of @xmath124 , and @xmath78 otherwise .",
    "hence , for the degraded channel , @xmath125 , which is _ lower _ than @xmath106 . for the degraded channel ,",
    "the iml decoder is also the optimal decoder . as this is a degraded channel , however , @xmath126 .",
    ".conditional distribution @xmath127 . in this case",
    ", the ml decoders of the marginals do not minimize @xmath107 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      given a joint channel distribution , finding an optimal or iml decoder is an easy task .",
    "in both cases we use maximum - likelihood decoders ; in the first case based on the joint distribution , whereas in the second case based on the marginal distributions . on the other hand , finding an imjp decoder requires an exhaustive search , which may be costly . in the polar coding setting , as we now show , the special structure of joint synthetic channels permits finding the imjp decoder without resorting to a search procedure .",
    "let @xmath7 be some bms channel that undergoes @xmath17 polarization steps .",
    "let @xmath128 and @xmath129 be two indices of synthetic channels , where @xmath130 .",

    "we call them the _ a - channel _ and the _ b - channel _ , respectively .",
    "their joint distribution is @xmath127 .",
    "i.e. , this is the probability that the output of the a - channel is @xmath101 and the output of the b - channel is @xmath102 , given that the inputs to the channels are @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .    with probability @xmath78 ,",
    "the prefix of @xmath102 is @xmath135 .",
    "namely , @xmath102 has the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes the remainder of @xmath102 after removing @xmath101 and @xmath133 .",
    "thus , @xmath138 for some arbitrary @xmath137 .",
    "the factor @xmath139 stems from the uniform distribution of @xmath133 . with some abuse of notation , we will write @xmath140 the right - most expression makes it clear that the portion of @xmath102 in which the input of the a - channel appears must equal the actual input of the a - channel .",
    "observe from   that we can think of @xmath141 as the joint distribution @xmath142 up to a constant factor .",
    "indeed , we will use @xmath141 to denote the joint channel where convenient .",
    "which decoders can we consider for joint synthetic channels ?",
    "the optimal decoder extracts @xmath133 from the output of the b - channel and proceeds to decode @xmath134 .",
    "this outperforms the sc decoder but is also impractical and does not lend itself to computing the probability that is of interest to us , the probability that _ either _ of the synthetic channels errs .",
    "a natural suggestion is to mimic the sc decoder , i.e. , to use an iml decoder .",
    "the joint probability of error of this decoder may decrease after stochastic degradation , so we discard this option .",
    "consider two decoders @xmath103 and @xmath104 for channels @xmath100 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "as above , @xmath42 is the error event of channel @xmath18 using decoder @xmath143 .",
    "we seek a lower bound on @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , we choose decoders @xmath103 and @xmath104 that minimize @xmath118 ; this is none other than the imjp decoder .",
    "its performance lower - bounds that of the iml decoder ( see  ) .",
    "as we shall later see , combined with a suitable degrading channel structure , the probability of error of the imjp decoder increases after stochastic degradation .",
    "conversely , it decreases under stochastic upgradation ; thus , combining the imjp decoder with a suitable upgrading procedure produces the desired lower bound .",
    "multiple decoders may achieve @xmath144 .",
    "one decoder can be found in a straight - forward manner ; we call it _ the _ imjp decoder .",
