    "we are interested in the problem of quickest detection of the onset of a signal in a system of @xmath0 sensors .",
    "we consider the situation in which , although the observations in one sensor can affect the observations in another , the onset of a signal can occur at different times ( i.e. , change points ) in each of the @xmath0 sensors ; that is , the change points differ from sensor to sensor . as an example in which this situation arises",
    "consider a system of sensors monitoring the health of a physical structure in which fault conditions are manifested by vibrations in the structure . before a change affects a given sensor",
    ", we have only noise in that sensor .",
    "then , after a change , the system is vibrating and thus the signal received in any location reflects a vibrating system .",
    "thus , observations at any given sensor are coupled with those received in other locations .",
    "the change points observed at different sensors can occur at different times because the source of the vibrations ( i.e. , the excitation ) may arrive at different structural elements at different times .",
    "relevant literature related to such models includes , for example , @xcite .",
    "we assume that , after re - scaling by a constant factor , the probability law of the observations is the same across sensors .",
    "this assumption , although seemingly restrictive , is realistic in view of the fact that the system of sensors is coupled .",
    "the constant then reflects the fact that signal strength can differ in different locations in the system of sensors .",
    "we model the signals through continuous - time it processes .",
    "the advantage of such models is the fact that they can capture complex dependencies in the observations .",
    "for example , an autoregressive process is a special case of the discrete - time equivalent of an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , which in turn , is a special case of an it process .",
    "other special cases of this model include markovian models , and linear state - space systems commonly used in vibration - based structural analysis and health monitoring problems @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the fact that the system of @xmath0 sensors is coupled makes the probabilistic treatment of the problem equivalent to the one in which all observations become available in one location .",
    "the reason is that one integrated information flow is sufficient for describing such a system .",
    "our objective is to detect the first onset of a signal in such a system . in other words ,",
    "we wish to detect the first change point in the system of sensors described above .",
    "our problem is thus concerned with on - line change detection .",
    "we assume that the change points are unknown constants and adopt a min - max approach to the detection of the minimal one .",
    "we set up the problem as a stochastic optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize an extended kullback - leibler distance which serves as a detection delay subject to a lower bound in the mean time to the first false alarm .",
    "so far , of the min - max type of a set - up only the case of an uncoupled system of observations has been considered and only in the case that the signals across sensors are modeled as independent brownian motions with constant drifts @xcite .",
    "our problem is also similar to the one discussed in @xcite which is concerned with the detection of the minimum of two poisson disorder times , but in which a bayesian approach to modeling the change points is taken .",
    "another interesting filtering approach to change - point detection is developed in a bayesian framework in @xcite .",
    "recently the case was also considered of change points that propagate in a sensor array @xcite . however , in this configuration the propagation of the change points depends on the identity of the first sensor affected and considers a restricted markovian mechanism of propagation of the change . for a summary of the latest work on the topic of quickest detection , please consult @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the case in which the change points can be different and do not propagate in any specific configuration .",
    "the objective is to detect the minimum ( i.e. , the first ) of the change points .",
    "we demonstrate that , in the situation described above , at least asymptotically , the minimum of @xmath0 cumulative sums ( cusums ) @xcite , is asymptotically optimal in detecting the minimum of the @xmath0 different change points , as the mean time to the first false alarm tends to infinity , with respect to an appropriately extended kullback - leibler divergence criterion @xcite that incorporates the possibility of @xmath0 different change points .",
    "the results in this paper generalize those of @xcite in that the minimum of @xmath0 cusums is asymptotically optimal not only in the case in which the observations across sensors are independent but also in the case in which they are coupled .",
    "in fact in this paper we not only generalize the asymptotic optimality of the @xmath0-cusum stopping rule to a coupled system of observations but also to more general it dynamics rather than the restricted brownian motion model of observations .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem and identify the quantities of interest . in ",
    "3 we analyze the properties of the proposed @xmath0-cusum stopping rule . in  4 , we provide asymptotic expansions of the quantities of interest as the threshold parameters of the @xmath0-cusum stopping rule tend to infinity . in  5 ,",
    "we demonstrate that the minimum of @xmath0 cusum stopping rules is asymptotically optimal in an extended kullback - leibler sense both in the case of equal and in the case of unequal signal strengths .",
    "the proofs of lemmas and propositions that are omitted can be found in appendices . throughout the paper , we denote by @xmath1 and @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "we sequentially observe the processes @xmath3 for all @xmath4 . in order to formalize this problem",
    "we consider filtered probability space @xmath5 with filtration @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the processes @xmath3 for all @xmath4 are it processes satisfying : @xmath8 where @xmath9 s are independent standard brownian motions , and @xmath10 denote the times of change - points , which are assumed to be deterministic constants but otherwise unknown . throughout , we will denote the minimum of @xmath11 s by , for all @xmath4 , we let @xmath12 . ]",
    "@xmath13 finally , we assume that @xmath14 for some predictable real - valued function @xmath15 on @xmath16 , satisfying the lipschitz condition and linear growth condition ( see for example , theorem 2.9 on page 289 of @xcite , or theorem 2.1 on page 375 of @xcite ) .",
    "the case considered in this paper is that in which there exist constants @xmath17 such that the drift processes after @xmath11 s are proportional to one another .",
    "more specifically , without loss of generality , we assume that :    [ assum1]there exist @xmath18 such that the processes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are modifications of one another under @xmath23 .    in particular , we examine two cases that are treated separately in the sequel ; the first one corresponds to signal - strength symmetry across sensors and the second one corresponds to across sensors .",
    "the former is described mathematically by assuming @xmath24 for all @xmath4 and the latter , can be captured mathematically by assuming @xmath25 .",
    "although assumption [ assum1 ] is mathematically necessary for the main results of this paper , in most applications the nature of @xmath26 s is the same across @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , in most applications the signal observed across all sensors @xmath27 is the same but can be felt at different strengths ( the constants @xmath28 represent the different strengths ) in different sensors .",
    "our formulation treats the general case in which the signal can arrive at different points in time in different sensors .    in what follows",
    "we describe an example of two sensors each meant to capture two coupled waves that are emitted as one seismic signal after the onset of an earthquake , namely the s wave and the t - wave ( see , for instance , the discussion following page 392 in @xcite ) .",
    "these waves are not only buried in noise but have the tendency to interact with each other making the detection of their onset particularly difficult and giving obvious rise to a coupled system .",
    "these waves in practice may actually have different onsets as discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us now represent by @xmath29 and @xmath30 the observations received in the sensors meant to detect the onset of the earthquake . before the onset of the earthquake both observations are simply noise .",
    "after the onset of the earthquake a signal will be emitted but may be received at different points in time in the different sensors .",
    "the models used to capture signals are often autoregressive @xcite whose continuous - time equivalents are ornstein - uhlenbeck processes .",
    "thus we need to allow for @xmath26 to depend on @xmath31 . of course",
    "more general models would be necessary in order to capture dependence on past oservations as well .",
    "this is the reason that in our model , @xmath26 are generalized to depend on the whole of the path of the observations @xmath31 up to time @xmath32 . moreover , a stronger intensity in one of the two waves is known to result in a stronger intensity in the other @xcite . this could then be modeled by allowing both @xmath33 and @xmath34 to have a positive dependence on @xmath30 and @xmath29 respectively ( note that this dependence does not have to be linear and could in general cases depend on prior observations too - not just the ones at the current time ) .",
    "even though the two waves are different , they do give rise to the same signal which may be felt with a different strength in each of the sensors and thus the restriction @xmath35 with @xmath36 , although may appear restrictive , is in fact not far from modeling reality .",
    "we notice of course that in this example we do not have to impose the absolute value condition as both @xmath33 and @xmath34 will have the same sign .",
    "another application is that of a vibrating mechanical system where each sensor may be monitoring a different location on the structure .",
    "the signal causing the vibration can be felt at different times in different locations and also with different strengths @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath31 represent the observations at sensor @xmath27 .",
    "at first there is no signal and the sensors only observe noise . after the onset of the signal , which may be felt at different times in different sensors , a signal arrives .",
    "a signal causing a vibration in one location may also affect the observations received in another .",
    "this leads to feedback @xcite-@xcite , which can then be modeled by allowing @xmath26 to depend on the observations received at all sensors .",
    "also the signal may be more pronounced in one sensor than in another depending on the location of the sensor .",
    "this can be captured by allowing the @xmath28 s to be different across sensors .",
    "in fact , by allowing the @xmath28 s to have different signs we are able to capture the situation in which the sensors are hit by the signal from opposite directions .",
    "the filtration @xmath37 is the filtration generated by the observations received by all sensors .",
    "thus by requiring that @xmath26 be @xmath38-measurable for all @xmath27 , we have managed to capture the coupled nature of the system .",
    "in particular , in the special case in which , say , @xmath39 , ( [ itodynamics ] ) describes a process that displays an autoregressive ( or its continuous equivalent @xcite ) behavior in @xmath40 , while still being coupled with the observations received by the other sensors . more specifically , the magnitude of each increment of the process @xmath40 at each instant @xmath32 is not only affected by @xmath29 but also by @xmath31 , @xmath41 , the observations at sensors @xmath42 .",
    "this couples the observations received in sensor @xmath43 with those received in sensors @xmath42 at each instant @xmath32 and results in a system of interdependent sensors .",
    "we notice that the special case described above can also be written in the form of a linear state - space model as follows : @xmath44 autoregressive models and , more generally , linear state space models have been used to capture seismic signals , navigation systems , vibrating mechanical systems , etc @xcite .",
    "the generality of however is much greater than the special case described above .",
    "this is seen in the fact that @xmath26 at each instant @xmath32 can depend on the totality of the observed paths of each of the signals received up to time @xmath32 .",
    "notice that this linear model clearly satisfies both the lipschitz condition and the linear growth condition . to incorporate the different signal strength in each of the sensor observations",
    ", we could update the present model in ( [ example ] ) by having different constants in each row of the second @xmath45 matrix appearing in the equation of the linear system above .    to formulate our problem mathematically",
    ", we will work with the canonical space @xmath46 endowed with the filtration @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the borel @xmath49-algebra generated by the the joint coordinate mapping @xmath50 : for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath4 .",
    "we introduce a family of probability measures on @xmath53 : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 for a fixed @xmath56 corresponds to the measure generated on @xmath46 by the @xmath0-dimensional process @xmath57 when the change in @xmath58 occurs at time point @xmath11 , for all @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the case that @xmath59 for all @xmath4 corresponds to no change regime , where @xmath60 is a @xmath0-dimensional brownian motion ; and the measure generated on @xmath46 is the the @xmath0-dimensional wiener measure , which we denote by @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "now we can restate assumption [ assum1 ] as the following :    [ assum1p ] there exist @xmath18 such that the processes @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath21 , @xmath65 are modifications of one another under @xmath55 for all @xmath66 .",
    "we will also assume the drift functions @xmath67 satisfy the novikov condition :    for all @xmath68 , we have @xmath69    by theorem 1.10 on page 371 of @xcite , we know that , if the change - points satisfy @xmath70 , we have @xmath71,\\,\\,\\,\\text{and}{\\nonumber}\\\\ \\frac{dp_{(\\tau_1,\\tau_2,\\tau_3,\\ldots,\\tau_n)}}{dp_{(\\tau_1,\\infty,\\infty,\\ldots,\\infty)}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{b}_t}=&\\frac{dp_{(\\tau_1,\\tau_2,\\infty,\\ldots,\\infty)}}{dp_{(\\tau_1,\\infty,\\infty,\\ldots,\\infty)}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{b}_t}=\\exp(u_2(t)-u_2(\\tau_2)),\\,\\,\\,\\forall t\\in[\\tau_2,\\min_{2<i\\le n}\\{\\tau_i\\}],{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so on , where , for all @xmath72 , @xmath73 in general , for all @xmath56 we have that , @xmath74    our objective is to find an @xmath75-stopping rule @xmath76 that balances the trade - off between a small detection delay subject to a lower bound on the mean - time to the first false alarm and will ultimately detect @xmath77 .",
    "to this effect , we propose a generalization of the @xmath78 of @xcite , namely @xmath79 where the supremum over @xmath80 is taken over the set in which @xmath81 .",
    "that is , we consider the worst detection delay over all possible realizations of paths of the @xmath0-tuple of stochastic processes @xmath57 up to @xmath82 and then consider the worst detection delay over all possible @xmath0-tuples @xmath83 over a set in which at least one of them is forced to take a finite value .",
    "this is because @xmath76 is a stopping rule meant to detect the minimum of the @xmath0 change points and therefore if one of the @xmath0 processes undergoes a regime change , any unit of time by which @xmath76 delays in reacting , should be counted towards the detection delay .",
    "this gives rise to the following stochastic optimization problem : @xmath84 the constraint in the above optimization problem is a measure on the first time to the first false alarm . to see this",
    ", one can recognize the functional @xmath85 as a measure of accumulation of energy of the signal @xcite up to time @xmath32 .",
    "the above constraint involves the expected value of this functional under the regime of no signal up to the time of stopping and is thus a measure of a mean time to the first false alarm @xcite .",
    "similarly , the criterion captures the accumulation of energy of the signal after the first instance at which a signal becomes available .",
    "it is possible to motivate this criterion through a kullback - leibler distance . to be more specific , for any bounded stopping rule @xmath76 such that @xmath86 we can apply to obtain that @xmath87 giving rise to the criterion @xmath88 which can be upper bounded by the criterion in as follows : @xmath89    similarly , for the false alarms we notice that @xmath90 dividing the upper bound in ( [ ub ] ) and the lower bound in ( [ lb ] ) by the number of sensors @xmath0 results in the optimization problem given in .    inspired by the optimality of equalizer rules as seen in @xcite",
    ", we will examine the performance under , of an ( almost ) equalizer rule @xmath76 which reacts at exactly the same time regardless of which change takes place first . to be more specific ,",
    "let us define @xmath91 for all @xmath92 .",
    "that is , @xmath93 is the detection delay of the stopping rule @xmath76 when @xmath94 is the first change - point .",
    "then for all stopping rules @xmath95 , @xmath96 we will restrict our attention to stopping rules @xmath95 that achieve the false alarm constraint with equality @xcite : @xmath97 and the `` equalizer rule '' condition : @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "clearly , from we know that , for such stopping rules we may simplify the performance index @xmath100 as @xmath101 as @xmath99 . while , given the complexity due to the dimensionality of the problem , it seems a formidable task to determine the exactly optimal stopping rule for , asymptotic expansions like will make it possible to find an asymptotically optimal stopping rule for our problem .",
    "to construct such a candidate stopping for problem , recall that in the case of @xmath102 , the drift , @xmath103 , is measurable with respect to the filtration generated by the coordinate mapping @xmath104 , @xmath105 , which we denote by @xmath106 .",
    "then it is known from @xcite that the problem in , when @xmath102 , is solved by the so - called cusum stopping rule : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the measures generated by @xmath109 on @xmath110 , when the change - point @xmath111 ; and @xmath112 is the wiener measure on @xmath110 .",
    "the threshold @xmath113 in is chosen so that @xmath114 . furthermore , with @xmath115 the threshold @xmath116 is the unique positive solution to @xmath117 , and the optimal detection delay is given by@xmath118    in the proof in @xcite that proves the optimality of the cusum stopping rule to the one - dimensional equivalent of , one vital assumption is necessary for the finiteness ( see theorem 1 of @xcite ) of the cusum stopping rule and the martingale properties of stochastic integrals , i.e. , for @xmath119 , and any @xmath68 , @xmath120 intuitively , a physical interpretation of the above assumption is that the signal over the whole positive real line has infinite energy , and thus the cusum stopping rule @xmath121 in will goes off in finite time with probability 1 .    in this work , we will thus assume analogous conditions :    for all @xmath122 , @xmath4 , and any @xmath68,@xmath123    we comment that is implied by , since the measures @xmath124 are all equivalent under .    a class of functions @xmath67 s that satisfy , and are the uniformly bounded lipschitz continuous functions that are also uniformly bounded away from 0 .",

    "the optimality of the cusum stopping rule in the presence of only one observation process suggests that a cusum type of stopping rule might display similar optimality properties in the case of multiple observation processes . in particular , an intuitively appealing rule , when the detection of @xmath130 is of interest , is the @xmath0-dimensional variant of the cusum stopping rule @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the cusum stopping rule for the process @xmath133 for @xmath4",
