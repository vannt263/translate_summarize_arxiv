    "indeed , since the massless thirring model is well  defined and does not suffer from infrared divergences ( see also @xcite ) a formulation of the free massless ( pseudo)scalar field @xmath244 , bosonizing the massless thirring model in the chirally broken phase , should not also suffer from an infrared problem .",

    "there are no objections for the existence of such a quantum field theory of a free massless ( pseudo)scalar field . as we have shown in @xcite for test functions taken from the schwartz class @xmath250 coleman s theorem",
    "tells nothing about the non  existence of goldstone bosons and spontaneously broken continuous symmetry in 1 + 1dimensional space  time .",
    "the removal of the collective zero  mode from the observable vibrational modes of the free massless ( pseudo)scalar field @xmath244 corresponds to wightman s assumption to formulate the quantum field theory of a free massless ( pseudo)scalar field @xmath244 on the schwartz class of test functions @xmath251 .",
    "we have reformulated this assertion in terms of the generating functional of green functions @xcite .",
