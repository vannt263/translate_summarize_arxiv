    "one candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) motivated by particle physics is the lightest neutral supersymmetric particle , the neutralino .",
    "supersymmetry is theoretically favored because it naturally leads to a unification of energy scales for all the fundamental forces and is a natural symmetry for grand unification theories such as string theory .",
    "the neutralino is a majorana particle , so it will annihilate and create particles with energies similar to the mass of the neutralino . some of these particles would be photons , charged particles that would start emitting and scattering light , and neutral pions that would decay into photons illuminating a neutralino star at energies near the neutralino mass",
    ". this radiation could be detectable by ground and/or orbiting gamma ray observatories@xcite .",
    "the galactic center ( gc ) was proposed early as a source of gamma - ray radiation from annihilation of dm@xcite , but recent tev observations of the gc has shown a point source coincident with the gc @xcite which appears to be a background for any observations of an annihilation signal .",
    "the next candidates for these observations are the local group galaxies @xcite .",
    "we carried out an observational campaign on selected local group galaxies with the whipple 10 m gamma - ray telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins in arizona , usa . no significant signal was found and we derive upper limits for the gamma - ray flux from these objects .",
    "the poster will include a spectrally dependent analysis and an extended source analysis .",
    "the expected flux from neutralino annihiliation is @xmath0 with the cross - section @xmath1 , the particle mass m , and the spectrum produced @xmath2 .",
    "the source profile is related to the density profile through @xmath3 where integral is taken over the line of sight .",
    "this flux factorization shows the terms depending on the particle physics , separated from the astrophysical considerations which are contained in @xmath4 . for a source small compared to the angular resolution of the detector at a distance d ,",
    "the integrated j can be expressed as an integral over the volume of the source as @xmath5 this integrated @xmath6 is a parameter that embodies the two astrophysical considerations for dm annihilation flux , the distance to the source and the density profile of the dm particles .",
    "close , dense dm clumps are therefore the best targets for observation .",
    "we choose the local group galaxies in order to compete with the @xmath7 factor in @xmath6 .",
    "additionally we tried to choose a variety of galaxy morphologies , because the baryonic matter in the galaxy can disrupt any dm cusp through heating .",
    "black holes are also expected to have a large effect on the inner regions of the dm profile .",
    "adiabatic growth of a black hole can lead to a spike in the dm profile@xcite .",
    "however any large merging event between two supermassive black holes should wash out any cusp in the profile .",
    "we focused this search on local group galaxies .",
    "the galactic center gamma - ray flux is probably not due to dm annihilation and so represents a background for a search for an annihilation signal .",
    "additionally annihilation in the halo of the milky way could be large compared to the field of view ( @xmath83 - 5@xmath9 ) and ground based imaging instruments have less sensitivity for such sources .",
    "dark matter rich milky way satellite dwarf galaxies are favored due to their proximity , high mass to light ratio , and the possibility of self - interacting dm .",
    "if the dm is non - interacting the cores of these galaxies will not evolve within the hubble time .",
    "the density of these smaller halos is found to be higher in simulations due to their earlier production epochs .",
    "the dwarf galaxies we chose were smaller than the field of view ( 2.4@xmath9 ) . in the visible wavelengths they were each @xmath80.5@xmath9 in diameter .",
    "the distance to draco is measured to be 76 @xmath10 6 kpc in @xcite using variable stars . in @xcite",
    "they measure the radial velocity dispersion of giant stars in draco .",
    "they find the rotation curve is flat or slightly increasing away from the core .",
    "the best fit dm halo profile is a nearly isotropic sphere ( r @xmath8 r@xmath11 ) of dm with a total mass of @xmath12 m@xmath13 in the inner 0.5@xmath9 .",
    "the distance to ursa minor is 69 @xmath10 4 kpc @xcite .",
    "ursa minor has clear substructure observed in the inner @xmath8 10 @xcite .",
    "the existence of this structure and an associated second population of stars is a mystery as this structure should only exist for a few hundred million years based on observations of stellar proper motions@xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility of self - interacting dm .",
    "a comparison of the observed astrophysical properties of draco and ursa minor is given in @xcite .",
    "the first rotation curve was made of m31 which was one of the earliest evidence of dm on galactic scales@xcite .",
    "andromeda is a galaxy larger than the milky way at a distance of 785 @xmath10 25@xcite .",
    "unfortunately there is evidence that m31 is undergoing a merger with two distinct populations of stars and a double nucleus .",
    "this merging process should wash out any cusp in the dm density profile so m31 was not chosen for this survey .",
    "m32 is the closest compact elliptical galaxy at a distance similar to m31 .",
    "stellar velocities as well as gas dynamics measure a single supermassive compact object , @xmath83.6 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath13 , in the core of m32 @xcite .",
    "hubble observations of the core of m32 suggest a density @xmath152 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the core of m32 is relaxed and so it is a good candidate for structures such as dm spikes around the central black hole .",
    "m32 extends about 10 across the sky so any emission should be point - like .",
    "m33 is a spiral galaxy at a distance of 809 @xmath10 24 kpc measured using red giant stars @xcite .",
    "the mass and density profile of the dm halo of m33 derived from rotation curves is well studied due to its proximity and orientation@xcite .",
    "m33 does not have a large black hole in the center @xcite which could lead to larger densities of dm if supermassive black hole formation disrupts the halo .",
    "m33 has an angular size of  1@xmath9 so it is contained in the field of view , but it may be an extended source",
    ". however most halos that would be visible with current sensitivities would be point - like .",
    ".the total exposure and the exposure used for this analysis on draco , ursa minor , m32 , and m33 .",
