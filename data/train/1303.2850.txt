    "advection is most likely responsible for charged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tev energies . in a hadronic scenario for the @xmath3-ray production , the single overall power - law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the mean energy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cr sources in the starburst region .",
