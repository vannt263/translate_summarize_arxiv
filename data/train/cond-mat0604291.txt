    "as alsewhere discussed , the study of the non extensive systems constitutes an interesting and fascinating challenger for the developments of the thermodynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this kind of systems is the existence of long - range correlations , whose origin delays on the existence of long - range interactions among the constituents particles or the small ( or mesoscopic ) nature of the system .",
    "we address in our previous paper @xcite a reconsideration of the foundations for a thermo - statistical description of the special case of the nonextensive hamiltonian systems .",
    "the main conclusions derived from this work are the following : ( 1 ) the universality of the microscopic mechanism of chaoticity supports the generic applicability of a thermostatistical description with microcanonical basis for the nonintegrable many - body hamiltonian systems @xcite , even for those nonextensive systems with long - range interactions @xcite , ( 2 ) extensive conditions of the traditional systems are not longer applicable for the nonextensive systems , but such properties could be generalized by considering the scaling selfsimilarity concept @xcite which is considered in order to establish an adequate thermo - statistical description in this context",
    ".    we will continue in the present paper our analysis of the foundations for a thermo - statistical description of the nonextensive hamiltonian systems .",
    "our aim now is to show how the scaling selfsimilarity concept could be used in order to perform an appropriate thermodynamic formalism in the systems with long - range interactions .",
    "as already discussed in our previous work , most of the hamiltonian systems with a practical interest exhibit exponential selfsimilarity scaling laws @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why the present discussion will be focussed in this special class of the nonextensive hamiltonian systems .",

    "selfsimilarity is just a general symmetry of the macroscopic description exhibited under the scaling transformations of the system size in @xmath0 times , @xmath1 , which manifests itself in every macroscopic behavior of the system , even in the macroscopic dynamics @xcite . from the mathematical viewpoint",
    ", selfsimilarity appears as a multiplicative uniparametric group of transformations @xmath2 , @xmath3 , which acts on those fundamental macroscopic observables @xmath4 determining the microcanonical macroscopic state of a given system , leading in this way to a scaling transformation of the number of microscopic configurations @xmath5 ( microcanonical accessible phase - space volume ) whose form does not depend on the macroscopic state and can be represented as follows : @xmath6 = \\mathcal{y}\\left\\langle \\alpha\\mathcal{y}^{-1}\\left (   w\\right )   \\right\\rangle , \\ ] ] where the function @xmath7  determines what we refer as the selfsimilarity scaling law of the system . according to the framework developed in the previous work @xcite , the selfsimilarity scaling law @xmath7 determines the generalized boltzmann principle ( microcanonical entropy ) and the specific statistical entropic compatible with the selfsimilatity of a given system : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",

    "a very simple example of system with nontrivial scaling transformations is found for the selfgravitating gas of identical nonrelativistic particles with a finite incompressible volume @xmath24 which interact among them by means of the newtonian gravity .",

    "for very low energies and large densities where @xmath27 the scaling transformations are approximately given by : @xmath28 while for very high energies and low densities where the particles size can be dismissed since @xmath29 , such scaling transformations can be expressed asyntotically as follows : @xmath30 results which have been obtained in refs.@xcite and it will be shown again in the section [ astro ] .    generally speaking , the determination of the specific selfsimilarity scaling transformations @xmath21 could be a very difficult task because of there is no methodology to establish them in a given application outside the extensive context . as already suggested in the introductory section of our previous paper @xcite , systems with long - range interactions look like the extensive systems in the neighborhood of the second - order phase transitions due to the long - range correlations existing in this region .",
    "this is the reason why we think that the well - known renormalization group methods @xcite should play a crucial role in the determination of the scaling selfsimilarity of a given nonextensive system .",

    "it can be shown by using the steepest descend method that the equivalence between @xmath44 and @xmath45 takes place in the thermodynamic limit when the following conditions are applicable :    * the macroscopic observables @xmath4 behave in a _ extensive - like _ way during the selfsimilarity scaling transformation @xmath21 : @xmath46 * there is only one stationary point @xmath47 satisfying the relation:@xmath48 where @xmath49 is the entropy per particle .",
    "the condition * i ) * is only trivially satisfied by the extensive systems when the microcanonical description is performed by using the called extensive observables , i.e. total energy , electric charge , etc .",
    "however , extensivity does not take place in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "in this context extensivity should be substituted by the scaling selfsimilarity , but the extensive - like character ( [ ext - like ] ) of the macroscopic observables @xmath4 does not hold generally speaking .",
    "the condition * ii ) * demands the concavity of the boltzmann entropy , property which can not be everywhere satisfied .",
    "the existence of several stationary points leads to a catastrophe in the legendre transformation which is related with the occurrence of first - order phase transitions at a given value of @xmath50 .",
    "such anomaly appears in those regions where at least one eigenvalue of the _ hessian _ of the boltzmann entropy:@xmath51 is positive .",
    "as already shown by gross , every anomaly in the hessian of the boltzmann entropy can be related with the existence of phase transitions , extending in this way the identification of such critical phenomena is systems outside the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we will show in this section that the conditions * i ) * and * ii ) * could be satisfied by considering the called reparametrization invariance of the microcanonical description .",
    "what is such _ reparametrization invariance _ ?",
    "as already commented , the microcanonical ensemble is just a dynamical ensemble , and therefore , every symmetry of the microscopic dynamics is also relevant at the macroscopic level in the microcanonical description .",
    "the reparametrization invariance is just a symmetry with a dynamical origin .",
    "let us consider now all those integrals of motion @xmath52 determining the microcanonical thermostatistical description of a given nonintegrable many - body hamiltonian system .",

    "we refer the partition @xmath68 as the _ abstract space of the integrals of motions _ , and it will be denoted simply by @xmath69 .",
    "we say that the map @xmath63 defines a n - dimensional euclidean coordinate representation @xmath58 of the  abstract space @xmath69 .",
    "the  coordinate representation @xmath58 of @xmath69 is not unique .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath70 be two diffeomorphic subsets of the n - dimensional euclidean space @xmath67 , that is , there exist a diffeomorphic map : @xmath71 among their elements .",
    "the terms `` diffeomorphic map '' means that the n - dimensional euclidean subsets @xmath58 and @xmath70 posses the same topological and diffeomorphic ( differential ) structure .",
    "the map @xmath72 defines a new bijective application among the elements of the space @xmath69 and the points @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath75 , and consequently , @xmath76 is also another n - dimensional euclidean coordinate representation of @xmath69 .",
    "the coordinate representations @xmath58 and @xmath70 are equivalent because of they represent the same abstract space @xmath69 .    generally speaking ,",
    "a reparametrization change is carried out when we move from the euclidean representation @xmath58 towards an equivalent euclidean representation @xmath70 .",
    "the totality of the diffeomorphic maps ( [ diffeomorphic ] ) constitutes certain group of transformations called the _ group of diffeomorphisms _ of the space @xmath69 , @xmath77 , which is the maximal symmetry that a geometrical theory could exhibit .",
    "every reparametrization change ( [ diffeomorphic ] ) also induces a reparametrization of the integrals of motions @xmath78 : @xmath79 since @xmath80 are integrals of motions , every @xmath81 @xmath82 will be also a integral of motion . due to the bijective character of the reparametrization change @xmath83 , the new set of integrals of motion @xmath84 generates the same partition @xmath85 of the phase - space .",
    "this is the reason why the sets @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be considered as _ equivalent representations _ of the relevant integrals of motion determining the microcanonical description .",
    "since the totality of the phase - space points belonging to a given subset @xmath88 @xmath68 represents the same microcanonical macroscopic state , and the diffeomorphic and topological structure of the abstract space @xmath69 does not depend on the reparametrization changes , it is not difficult to understand that the microcanonical description is reparametrization invariant .",
    "[ inv_w]the microcanonical ensemble @xmath32 ( [ pdf ] ) is invariant under every reparametrization change @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "such invariance is straightforward derived from the following identity of the dirac delta function:@xmath91 which leads to the following transformation rule for the partition function @xmath92:@xmath93 and consequently:@xmath94 we have considered here the implicit dependence of integrals of motion on the system size @xmath95 .",
    "a corollary of the theorem [ inv_w ] is that the physics derived from the microcanonical description is reparametrization invariant since the expectation values of every macroscopic observable @xmath96 derived from the microcanonical distribution function @xmath32 exhibits this kind of symmetry:@xmath97 relation which is straightforwardly followed by using the identity ( [ invariance ] ) .",
    "the reparametrization invariance does not introduce anything new in the macroscopic description except the possibility of describing the macroscopic state by using any representation @xmath70 equivalent to the original representation @xmath58 , a situation analogue to describe the physical space @xmath98 by using a cartesian coordinates @xmath99 or spherical coordinates @xmath100 .",
    "notice that the diffeomorphic reparametrization changes demand the analyticity of the integrals of motions , which is a necessary condition for a particular integral of motion @xmath101 be relevant in the macroscopic description . on the other hand ,",
    "the integrals of motions @xmath102 are derived from their commutativity with the hamiltonian @xmath103 .",
    "since @xmath103 is one of those integrals of motion determining the macroscopic state ( total energy ) , the hamiltonian loses its identity during the reparametrization changes ( [ changex ] ) .",
    "the only way to preserve the condition @xmath104 during the reparametrization changes is  by demanding the commutativity among all those integrals of motion determining the macroscopic state @xmath105 : @xmath106 interestingly , this is the necessary condition for the simultaneous determination of physical observables in the quantum mechanics , and therefore , reparametrization invariance is also consistent in this level .",
    "reparametrization invariance is a symmetry of the microcanonical description which allows us to perform a geometrical description in this framework , a covariant formulation of the thermostatistics .",
    "geometrical formulations of the thermostatistics are very well - known in physics .",
    "some recently proposed geometrical formulations are given in refs .",

    "the microcanonical partition function @xmath92 allows us the introduction of the invariant measure @xmath112 . taking into account such invariant measure , the integration of a given physical observable @xmath109 defined on the space @xmath69 ( microcanonical ensemble ) is directly related with the phase - space integration : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a subset of the space @xmath69 , and @xmath115 is its corresponding image in the phase - space .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the boltzmann entropy @xmath116 is not an scalar function .",
    "the microcanonical accessible volume @xmath18 is just the invariant measure of a small neighborhood @xmath114 of the interest point obtained after by performing a coarsed grained partition of the space @xmath69 : @xmath117 in applications @xmath18 is taken approximately by @xmath118 , where the volume @xmath119 of the coarsed grain subset @xmath114 is regarded as a very small constant .",
    "the small constant @xmath119 becomes unimportant when @xmath95 is very large , that is , with the imposition of the thermodynamic limit , and consequently , the boltzmann entropy could be considered as a scalar function in this limit .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble provides a full characterization of the macroscopic properties of a given isolate hamiltonian system in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the imposition of the thermodynamic limit @xmath120  leads under certain conditions to the equivalence of the microcanonical description with certain simplified characterization : the macroscopic description performed by the canonical ensemble .",
    "as already discussed , such canonical ensemble is determined from the relevant statistical entropy derived from the specific scaling selfsimilarity exhibited by the interest system , i.e. : the exponential selfsimilarity is associated with the shannon - boltzmann - gibbs extensive entropy ( [ exp ] ) , which naturally leads to the called boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "it is very easy to verify that the canonical distribution function ( [ pdf ] ) does not exhibit the original reparametrization invariance of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this means that the physics in the canonical ensemble depends on the coordinate representation @xmath58 of the abstract space @xmath69 of the relevant integrals of motion used for perfoming the macroscopic characterization of a given system .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic formalism could not satisfy this kind of symmetry , and consequently , the ordering information derived from its consideration is not reparametrization invariant .    as already discussed in section [ thf ] , the equivalence between the microcanonical and the canonical descriptions demands the fulfillment the conditions * i ) * and * ii ) * , and therefore , such ensemble equivalence could not be performed by using an arbitrary representation",
    ". however , the existence of the reparametrization invariance of the microcanonical descriptions plays a crucial role in arriving to a well - defined thermodynamic formalism .",
    "the extensive - like behavior of the integrals of motion under the scaling transformations is simply satisfied by chosing an appropriate coordinate representation @xmath70  of the space @xmath69  exhibiting this kind of behavior under the scaling transformations .",
    "there are some trivial examples in which this demand is very easy to accomplish .",
    "considering the example illustrated at the end of section [ rev ] , the total energy of the selfgravitating gas of identical point particles interacting by means of the newtonian gravity grows with the scaling following a @xmath121 power law @xcite , and therefore , an appropriate representation with an extensive - like behavior could be @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the characteristic constant energy which evidently follows the same @xmath121 power law , being @xmath124 a bijective function .",
    "the reader may notice that such procedure differs from the called kac argument @xcite because of the total energy is not arbitrarily forced to be extensive , since its scaling behavior is determined from the system selfsimilarity .",
    "we only demand the extensivity in the _ coordinate representation _ of the relevant integrals of motion in order to ensure the ensemble equivalence in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the main difficulty in chosing an appropriate representation of the relevant integrals of motion is that the specific selfsimilarity scaling transformation @xmath21 acting on the space @xmath69 is _ a priori _ unknown and have to be determined .    as already shown , the transition from the microcanonical towards the canonical description with the imposition of the thermodynamic limit and the consequent establishment of the system selfsimilarity leads to a breakdown of the original reparametrization symmetry .",
    "however , is the reparametrization invariance completely broken during this transition ?",
    "the answer is _",
    "no_. this fact is very easy to understand by considering the above example about the selfgravitating gas : anyone bijective function @xmath125 could be used with the purpose of describing the macroscopic characterization , and therefore , there is a complete set of admissible coordinate representations @xmath126 exhibiting an extensive - like behavior during the scaling transformations .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath70 be two coordinate representations belonging to the set of admissible representations @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the reparametrization change between them . since the scaling transformations for every coordinate in both representations are given by @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the reparametrization change",
    "@xmath131 is a _ homogeneous map _ satisfying the relations:@xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "the complete set of reparametrization changes acting in the set of admissible representations @xmath127 constitutes the _ group of homogeneous transformations _",
    "@xmath134 , which is a subgroup of the group of diffeormorphisms @xmath77 already commented .",
    "the symmetry associated with the transformations of the homogeneous group @xmath134 is just the residual symmetry of the original reparametrization invariance of the microcanonical description .",
    "the thermodynamic potential @xmath135 obtained from the legendre transformation ( [ legendre ] ) is @xmath134-invariant:@xmath136    the demostration is straightforwardly followed by performing a variable change in the partial derivative of the boltzmann entropy:@xmath137 and considering the homogeneous character of the reparametrization change ( [ map - hom]):@xmath138    we have shown in this way that the `` microcanonical '' thermodynamic functions @xmath139 and @xmath135 , as well as their first derivatives exhibit a covariant behavior under the reparametrizations changes of the homogeneous group @xmath134 .",
    "however , it does not mean that the thermodynamic formalism exhibits this kind of symmetry because of the conditions * ii ) * is necessary to satisfy also in order to ensure the ensemble equivalence .",
    "the fulfillment of this condition could be perturbed because of the reparametrization changes can _ affect the concavity _ of the boltzmann entropy .",
    "let us to illustrate this by considering the following example .",
    "let @xmath140 be a map between two seminfinite euclidean lines , @xmath141 , which in the representation @xmath142 is given by the concave function @xmath143 ( where @xmath144 ) .",
    "let us now consider a reparametrization change @xmath145 given by @xmath146 ( which is evidently bijective ) .",
    "the map @xmath140 in the new representation @xmath147 is given by the function @xmath148 ( where @xmath149 ) , which clearly is a convex function .",
    "the above trivial example teaches us that the concavity of the boltzmann entropy depends on the representation @xmath150 used to perform the canonical description , and therefore , ensemble equivalence ( or inequivalence ) depends on the coordinate representation of the space @xmath69 .",
    "this is a very interesting point since the ensemble inequivalence is a signature of the first - order phase transitions .",
    "according to the microcanonical thermostatistics of gross @xcite , the hessian of the boltzmann entropy ( [ hessian ] )  gives a complete characterization of the phase - transitions in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "however , in spite of the aparent similarity , the components of the hessian are not the components of a covariant tensor of second - order because of they obey the transformation rule:@xmath151 while the correct transformation rule is given by ( [ rule_tensor ] ) .",
    "this means that such classification of phase - transitions based on the concavity of the entropy is not reparametrization invariant .",
    "therefore , the coordinate representation of the space @xmath69 should be specified in order to precise the existence of first - order phase transitions .",
    "how such ambiguity in the first - order phase - transition existence could be physically acceptable ?",
    "the question is that the coordinate representation @xmath58 of the space @xmath69 is determined from the external constrains imposed to the system .",

    "this experimental arrangement not only fix the system temperature @xmath153 , but also the coordinate representation by using the system energy @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the existence of first - order phase transition is not necessarily an intrinsic characteristic of a given system because of it depends on the external conditions which have been imposed .",
    "what happen when the ensemble inequivalence or any other anomaly is present at a given point @xmath154 @xmath69 without matter the coordinate representation @xmath150 used in the macroscopic description ?",
    "such anomalies are not representation - dependent , that is , they do not depend on the external conditions imposed to the system .",

    "we think that such abrupt topological changes in the configurational space could be took place when they are associated with topological anomalies at the macrocopic level , that is , when such anomalies are not dependent of the coordinate representation of the space @xmath69 .",
