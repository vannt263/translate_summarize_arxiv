    "synthetic genetic networks provide researchers with the opportunity of designing biologically based circuitry for accomplishing specific functions . in principle",
    ", such circuits can be incorporated into natural cellular machinery or used in an entirely synthetic environment .",
    "oscillators are essential motifs for circuit design @xcite .",
    "the repressilator is a synthetic genetic oscillator ( go ) in the form of a ring of three genes sequentially inhibiting one another s transcription .",
    "the go has been inserted experimentally into _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite and extensively studied theoretically via deterministic and stochastic approaches @xcite .",
    "coupling of individual gos is important in coordinated activity of go populations . bacterial quorum sensing ( qs ) @xcite , which provides for cell - cell communications in bacterial populations by fast diffusion of small specific molecules ( autoinducers ) , is a natural candidate for the role of being a manager for synthetic genetic network dynamics",
    "this idea was effective , for instance , in constructing several synthetic multicellular systems like the ecological predator - prey @xcite , population control @xcite , and other models ( see refs . in recent review @xcite ) .",
    "qs - coupling has been used for go synchronization in different mathematical models @xcite , as well as in experimental demonstration of a multicellular clock @xcite .",
    "recently , the qs system has been used to construct a synthetic microbial consortium with population - level oscillations @xcite .",
    "although autoinducers freely diffuse between cells with gos inside , this type of coupling as a whole can not be reduced to simple linear diffusive coupling which still dominates in studies of coupled oscillators .",
    "an autoinducer is not a required element of a go , its production may be controlled by one gene of the go networks but its target is transcription regulation of a different gene in the same or neighboring cells .",
    "being physically diffusive , this coupling mechanism is , however , difficult to present as just one classical diffusive term in the ode system describing the genetic circuits . to write down the coupling term mathematically",
    "it is necessary to consistently consider the particular reaction scheme .",
    "this way to draw the coupling term seems quite natural for biochemical and genetic networks in which communication is a cumulative multistep process which includes regulative production , diffusion , binding to targets , and other important metabolic steps .",
    "the first attempt to demonstrate theoretically the possibility of in - phase synchronization of repressilators was successfully realized @xcite and checked in a simple electronic model @xcite , but not all collective regimes were detected within the limits of the coupling design considered .",
    "later publication demonstrated that the use of limited parameter space masked other dynamical regimes .",
    "the anti - phase limit cycle ( aplc ) and complex periodic regimes were revealed when stronger repression in transcriptional regulation and greater differences in time scales of mrna and transcription factor kinetics were taken into account @xcite .    in the next version @xcite of qs - dependent cell - cell interaction , identical repressilators",
    "were coupled using a modification of the additional plasmid for the qs mechanism .",
    "the modification provided phase - repulsive interaction between oscillators which leads to a rich set of stable attractors : periodic regular anti - phase limit cycle ( aplc  time series are shifted by half - period ) , stable homogeneous steady state ( hss - the identical values of the same name variables in each oscillator ) , inhomogeneous steady states ( ihss - different values of variables ) , inhomogeneous limit cycle ( ihlc ) emerging from ihss , and chaotic regime which appears via torus bifurcation of the ap regime .",
    "some regimes can coexist over broad intervals of model parameters , which opens a possibility for switching between attractors in the presence of extrinsic / intrinsic noise .",
    "specific examples of all these regimes will be presented in results section .",
    "an important problem in the studies of gene expression regulation is very limited knowledge of the parameter values .",
    "the transcription regulation is typically described by hill function , @xmath0 , where the main parameters are the maximum transcription rate ( @xmath1 ) and the degree of cooperativity ( @xmath2 ) of transcription factor ( @xmath3 ) binding to promoter .",
    "previous publications @xcite concentrated on the dynamics with small hill repression @xmath2 and limited values for transcription rates , time scales ratios for mrna and proteins kinetics , and qs signaling molecule ( autoinducer ) activity as transcription activator .",
    "the goals of this paper are to significantly extend the main parameter areas within the limits of one model of qs - coupled identical or near identical repressilators @xcite to detect new dynamic behavior(s ) , to present the coarse - grained structure and content of the phase diagram ( the map of regimes ) , and to investigate the robustness of multistability with respect to parameter values .",
    "we will use a reduced version of the mathematical model , as well as its electronic circuit model @xcite adapted for two coupled 4-dim repressilators .",
    "the effectiveness of this analog version has been checked recently in the study of a single repressilator with qs feedback @xcite .",
    "use of the inherently different numerical and electronic models provides a test of the robustness of the dynamics .",
    "we consider a wide range of control parameters , even going beyond the characteristic limits known for them today .",
    "the results obtained using the extended ranges may be viewed as predictions of the model for the future , when these extended limits become accessible with the fast development of synthetic genetics .",
    "the dynamical results produced by the qs - coupled oscillators used here may inspire application to other systems beyond synthetic gene circuits , such as electronic ones ( see below ) or chemical systems of interacting water droplets bearing oscillating bz reactions coupled via diffusion in selective oil environments @xcite .",
    "we find that for a small degree of repression of transcription factor binding ( @xmath4 ) anti - phase lc is a single homogeneous periodic attractor , and that this attractor loses stability via torus bifurcation if @xmath2 increases ( @xmath5 ) and gets replaced by complex / chaotic regimes over a large interval of coupling strengths ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this @xmath6-continuation branch of the ap limit cycle and chaos coexists with stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous ss and ihlc providing a rich landscape of attractors in multi - parameter space .",
    "the sizes of parameter s intervals occupied by the complex regimes are unusually large and include many periodic windows which contain both spatially symmetrical and asymmetrical stable limit cycles .",
    "the presence of asymmetrical limit cycles results in the appearance of chaotic trajectories built from pieces with randomly alternating `` polarity '' .",
    "this type of chaotic time series differs from that of simple anti - phase chaos observed in parameter regions devoid of asymmetrical limit cycles .",
    "the extension of the ranges for parameter analysis also reveals a new type of multistability if changes in the maximum transcription rate ( @xmath1 ) are taken into account . for a value of the hill coefficient near 3 a range of @xmath1 gives rise to the coexistence of the complex nonperiodic oscillations and the anti - phase limit cycle with 5 return times in one period .",
    "again , the range of this hysteresis covers large intervals of the coupling strengths and @xmath1 .",
    "a further increase in transcription cooperativity up to @xmath7 leads to the recovery of stability of the in - phase limit cycle in addition to stable aplc . in - phase limit cycle is not a dominant regime but its appearance seems important to complete the entire dynamic picture demonstrated by the two coupled identical repressilators .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of two repressilators interacting via repressive qs coupling as used previously @xcite .",
    "figure [ repqs ] shows a single repressilator coupled via qs to the external medium .",
    "the three genes in the loop produce mrna ( @xmath8 ) and proteins ( @xmath9 ) , and they impose hill function inhibition on each other in cyclic order by the preceding gene .",
    "the qs feedback is maintained by the ai produced ( rate @xmath10 ) by the protein b while the ai communicates with the external environment and activates ( rate @xmath11 in combination with michaelis function ) production of mrna for protein c , which , in turn , reduces the concentration of protein a resulting in activation of protein b production . in this way",
    "the protein b plays a dual role of direct inhibition of protein c synthesis and ai - dependent activation of protein c synthesis , resulting in complex dynamics of the repressilator , even for just a single repressilator @xcite .    a repressilator genetic network with qs feedback .",
    "lower case ( a , b , c ) are mrna and upper case ( a , b , c ) are expressed protein repressors .",
    "ai is the auto - inducer molecule which diffuses through the cell membrane . ]",
    "the original models of a single repressilator @xcite used re - scaled dimensionless quantities for rate constants and concentrations .",
    "we reduce the model for the case of fast mrna kinetics ( @xmath12 are assumed in steady state with their respective inhibitors @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 ) .",
    "the resulting equations for the protein concentrations and ai concentration s are ,    @xmath15    [ ode ]    where @xmath16 for the two repressilators , @xmath17 are the ratios of protein decay rate to mrna decay rate , @xmath1 accounts for the maximum transcription rate in the absence of an inhibitor , @xmath2 is the hill coefficient for inhibition , and @xmath18 is the ratio of ai decay rate to mrna decay rate .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath19 depends on the permeability of the membrane to the ai molecule .",
    "the concentration of ai in the external medium is @xmath20 and is determined according to quasi - steady - state approximation by ai produced by both repressilators ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , and a dilution factor @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath23 numerical simulations are performed with xppaut @xcite and by direct integration with 4-th order runge - kutta solver .",

    "finally , we consider the unstable aplc region for @xmath2 beyond 3.2 .",
    "generally , simulations find that parameters @xmath1 or @xmath11 have to be changed in order to find interesting regimes ( chaos , asymmetric limit cycles , symmetric regular n : n - lc , intermittency ) like those demonstrated for @xmath2 around 3.15 .",
    "for example , for @xmath117 and @xmath118 the interesting regimes appear only if @xmath119 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath81 the system demonstrates only stable aplc for @xmath120 , however the typical complex evolution @xmath121 is restored when @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "hill coefficient @xmath124 with @xmath118 requires further reduction in @xmath1 ( 55 - 70 ) for the existence of interesting multistability which are then located at @xmath125 . if activation is significantly reduced ( @xmath81 )",
    "then @xmath1 must be increased to get interesting regimes .",
    "however , these regimes are then located at @xmath126 if @xmath127 .",
    "we conclude that limited but significant variations of basic parameters in 3-dim space do not discover other qualitatively new dynamic regimes compared to those described above .",
    "using simple 4-dim mathematical and electronic models of identical ring oscillators we demonstrated that the realistic design of quorum sensing coupling proposed earlier @xcite leads to remarkable multistability even for a pair of oscillators .",
    "a qs - coupling system can be incorporated into genetic circuits in different ways , acting solely as a coupling agent ( as in the case of repressilators @xcite and relaxators @xcite ) , or it may also be an integral part of an individual oscillator @xcite . in any case , the additional differential equation for autoinducer contains a term describing its linear diffusion but the resulting coupling is nonlinear for the oscillators because of a delay in the autoinducer production and because the production of one of the oscillator s variables is activated nonlinearly .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect unusual collective modes for qs - coupled oscillators , as was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "however , that study of multistability considered mainly the role of coupling strength , with the other parameters of the single oscillator like repression cooperativity and the transcription rate being fixed . therefore , the generality of qs - induced multistability was still obscure because the origin of many new regimes can be traced to modulations in oscillation amplitudes and the `` steepness '' of repression which are strongly dependent on the dynamic properties of the isolated oscillators .",
    "we extended the study by addressing the roles of the other parameters and detected an interesting evolution of multistability in the 3-dim parametric space defined by hill coefficient of repression ( @xmath2 ) , ai - induced activation ( @xmath11 ) and the rate of transcription ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this extension is not a pure theoretical exercise ; rather , it is stimulated by experimental progress in the development of engineered promoters having different strengths and structures that control the cooperativity in binding of transcription factors .",
    "combination of numerical simulations , bifurcation analysis and electronic measurements is beneficial to investigations of dynamical systems like the synthetic genetic network studied here .",
    "benefits come from identifying the similarities and the differences between results of the numerical and electronic models .",
    "dynamic characteristics that are similar in both systems are unlikely to be particularly sensitive to the model parameters , and , therefore , could be present in other similarly constructed systems , possibly even real biological systems in the future .    for small @xmath2 around 2.8",
    "our reduced 4-dim repressilator models reproduce the basic regimes found in the 7-dim model used in @xcite : stable anti - phase limit cycle started for small and ended at high coupling strength and stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady states , as well as inhomogeneous limit cycle at intermediate coupling strengths .",
    "multiple regimes may coexist over a broad range of control parameters .",
    "further smooth increase in hill repression @xmath2 in association with the respective adaptation of activation @xmath11 introduces an unstable aplc via torus bifurcation over a region of coupling strengths as demonstrated by the results for @xmath54 . with increasing coupling strength ,",
    "the dynamics in the region where the aplc is unstable shows gradually developing complex oscillations ( as can be detected using fft analysis and/or from calculations of subperiod distributions ) , which begin with beating near the tr bifurcations .",
    "an extraordinary property of the dynamics for @xmath5 is the coexistence of the developing complex oscillations and the stable limit cycle consisting of five subperiods ( see figs .",
    "[ phsplts ] and [ n3qbif_5:5 ] ) which itself is an isolated solution .",
    "the q - intervals of coexistence strongly depend on the amplitudes of isolated repressilators , being very long for @xmath128 and nearly negligible for @xmath129 . starting from intermediate @xmath1 ( @xmath130 for our parameter set )",
    "the emergence of chaos at low q and its extinction at higher q are the result of sequential branch point and period doubling bifurcations of this 5:5lc .",
    "each local bifurcation of our system on the @xmath131 plane for @xmath5 is well known but the structure of the map of regimes as a whole is unusual to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we found the interval of @xmath2-values where chaos in two qs - coupled repressilators is not an exotic regime but instead exists in a large 3-dim parametric space .",
    "moreover , a further increase in @xmath2 up to @xmath102 introduces new behaviors inside the q - interval with the unstable regimes , including regular and irregular asymmetrical ones ( figs .  [ as ] and [ chaos - types ] ) .",
    "all collective modes presented in our study are the result of competition between repression ( fig .",
    "[ ehill ] ) and activation ( fig .",
    "[ qs - activation ] ) of transcription of one specifically selected gene .",
    "these antagonistic impacts have different dependencies on the values of the variables : repression is cooperative while activation is linear with saturation .",
    "this means that variation of one parameter , e.g.  hill repression @xmath2 , may require the other parameters be tuned to escape the transition of the system to a simple attractor like hss .",
    "we investigated several sets of parameters and found that the evolutions of the complex regimes as a function of coupling strength are qualitatively very similar .",
    "then we looked over the typical dynamics of chaos and discovered its basic skeleton although many details are still unclear .",
    "the most impressive result is the existence of several types of chaos : ( 1 ) simple anti - phase chaos riddled with very narrow periodic windows of symmetric regimes of the n : n - lc type ; ( 2 ) asymmetric chaos resulting from period doubling of regular asymmetric regimes , e.g.  as1:2lc and as2:3lc ; and ( 3 ) symmetric chaos consisting of symmetric and asymmetric parts with alternating polarities .",
    "the last type of chaos is the most flexible in its specific manifestations and is closely linked to intermittency which is also observed but only near the boundaries between the regimes .",
    "the possibility for chaos due to linear diffusion between _ identical _ regular oscillators is known since the middle of the 1970s @xcite , but the parameter regions of chaos are typically very narrow .",
    "chaos via torus bifurcation of anti - phase limit cycle has been observed in two rssler oscillators coupled by cross - diffusion @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is only one example of chaotization due to nonlinear coupling of identical biochemical oscillators @xcite where `` bichaoticity '' was demonstrated in narrow parameter intervals without analysis of other regimes inside chaos .",
    "a large cooperativity @xmath2 ( around 4 ) opens the gate in parameter space for the in - phase limit cycle which becomes stable for large q before its transition to hss via infinite period bifurcation .",
    "it is still not clear why phase - repulsive coupling permits the formation of aplc / iplc switching .",
    "intuitively it may be due to the increase in repressilator `` stiffness '' for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "similar frequency trigger covering a wide range of parameters was observed in the system of two fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators coupled via the recovery variable if their stiffness was large @xcite .",
    "all the results discussed above have been obtained for sets with different @xmath132 .",
    "the oscillators are identical but move along the partial limit cycles nonuniformly because the kinetics of the specific variable in one element of the ring is faster than in the other elements .",
    "variation in @xmath132 is biologically motivated given that there are parameters differences between the three repressilator genes , their promoters , and degradation rates of the corresponding transcription factors .",
    "this internal variety in @xmath132 may enhance the coupling - induced diversity of the attractors . to check this possibility we simulated the dynamic behavior in the 3-dim parameter cube @xmath133 using several sets of @xmath132 varying in the degree of equalization ( e.g. 0.25 , 0.15 , 0.15 ; 0.3 , 0.25 , 0.15 ) ( data not shown )",
    ". the only general effect of smoothing the @xmath132 is the necessity to tune reasonably the other parameters but the qualitative picture of the phase diagrams is not changed .",
    "no doubt , the model in eq .",
    "is a strongly reduced dynamic toy which has limited experimental support for formulation of exact forms of functions for the basic repressilators ring and especially for the subsystem describing coupling .",
    "however , the general design formalized in eq .   is realistic and realizable by the methods of synthetic genetics . therefore , we propose that a pair of coupled repressilators may be viewed as a prototype of a flexible generator with remarkable dynamic behavior which may be useful beyond the construction of synthetic genetic networks .",

    "<S> genetic oscillators play important roles in cell life regulation . </S>",
    "<S> the regulatory efficiency usually depends strongly on the emergence of stable collective dynamic modes , which requires designing the interactions between genetic networks . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of two identical synthetic genetic repressilators coupled by an additional plasmid which implements quorum sensing ( qs ) in each network thereby supporting global coupling . in a basic genetic ring oscillator network </S>",
    "<S> in which three genes inhibit each other in unidirectional manner , qs stimulates the transcriptional activity of chosen genes providing for competition between inhibitory and stimulatory activities localized in those genes . </S>",
    "<S> the `` promoter strength '' , the hill cooperativity coefficient of transcription repression , and the coupling strength , i.e. , parameters controlling the basic rates of genetic reactions , were chosen for extensive bifurcation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the results are presented as a map of dynamic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the remarkable multistability of the anti - phase limit cycle and stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady states exists over broad ranges of control parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the anti - phase limit cycle stability and the evolution of irregular oscillatory regimes in the parameter areas where the anti - phase cycle loses stability . in these regions we observed developing complex oscillations , collective chaos , and multistability between regular limit cycles and complex oscillations over uncommonly large intervals of coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> qs - coupling stimulates the appearance of intrachaotic periodic windows with spatially symmetric and asymmetric partial limit cycles which , in turn , change the type of chaos from a simple anti - phase character into chaos composed of pieces of the trajectories having alternating polarity . </S>",
    "<S> the very rich dynamics discovered in the system of two identical simple ring oscillators may serve as a possible background for biological phenotypic diversification , as well as a stimulator to search for similar coupling in oscillator arrays in other areas of nature , e.g. in neurobiology , ecology , climatology etc . </S>"
