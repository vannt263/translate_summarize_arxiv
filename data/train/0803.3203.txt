    "there has been a large amount of research effort towards a quantum theory of gravity with matter as topological invariants since a ribbonized preon model@xcite was coded into local braided ribbon excitations@xcite .",
    "these excitations are edges of framed three - valent spin networks present in models related to loop quantum gravity with non - zero cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "the topological invariants of ribbon braids are able to detect chirality and code chiral conservation laws .",
    "the results of @xcite have a serious limitation , namely that the conservation laws which preserve the excitations are exact . in other words ,",
    "the braid excitations of @xcite behave like solitons in integrable systems : they propagate through each other under local dynamical moves , leaving no possibility for interaction , e.g. creation and annihilation , to occur@xcite .",
    "consequently , interpreting braid excitations found in @xcite as particles - in particular the standard model particles - is not going to work out unless interactions are successfully introduced to that model .",
    "although there has been a search for a modification of the dynamics studied in @xcite which would allow both propagation and interactions of the local braid excitations , a new model has also been put forward , which solves the problem of interaction and opens new interesting directions worth of investigation@xcite .",
    "the new model extends the graphs from three - valent to four - valent spin networks , embedded in a topological three - manifold , which also gives rise to local braid excitations , and bases the dynamics on the dual pachner moves naturally associated with four - valent graphs .",
    "the two main reasons of this extension are : that four - valent graphs and the corresponding dual pachner moves naturally occur in spin foam models@xcite , and that vertices of four - valent spin networks have true correspondence to three - dimensional space .",
    "nevertheless , a pachner move in the model is allowed on a subgraph only when the interior of the dual topology of the subgraph is homeomorphic to an open trivial ball in @xmath0 .",
    "this condition ensures the stability of certain braid excitations@xcite .",
    "this is the third of a series of papers along the research on the new model .",
    "our previous work formulates a clear and useful graphic calculus as the tool to study the new model .",
    "we summarize our previous main results as follows . in @xcite",
    "we found that 3-strand braids , each of which consists of two adjacent nodes sharing three edges , are of most interest and defined equivalence moves which relate projections of diffeomorphic embeddings of the same spin network .",
    "furthermore , we classified 3-strand braids into two primary categories : reducible braids and irreducible braids .",
    "the former contains braids which are equivalent to braids with less number of crossings under equivalence moves .",
    "@xcite shows that some stable braids propagate , in the sense that under the local dynamical moves they exchange places with their adjacent substructures in the graph .",
    "this propagation is in most cases chiral , in which a braid can only propagates along an edge in the larger graph only to the left and its mirror image ( which is a distinct state ) can only propagates to the right .",
    "the chirality of this propagation is related to our classification of braids in @xcite .",
    "additionally , two neighboring braids can interact , in the sense that they merge into a new braid under local equivalence and dynamical moves ; however , for this to happen either or both of them must be in a small class of braids called actively - interacting .",
    "lastly we found that any actively - interacting braid is equivalent to some trivial braid with twists .    due to the key role the actively - interacting braids play in this model , in this paper we study their interactions in more details in an algebraic way . despite the power of the previously developed graphic calculus in @xcite ,",
    "a symbolic algebra would provide a concise tool , convenient for computation and more importantly more able to demonstrate conserved quantities as `` quantum numbers '' . as the ultimate goal of this model is to interpret certain braid excitations as matter degrees of freedom in a physical way - particularly to see if the braid excitations can be mapped to standard model particles - we need a symbolic algebra which exhibits possible symmetries in a more transparent and lucid way .",
    "indeed , as a follow - up work of @xcite , in @xcite similar algebraic approach is being taken for three - valent spin networks , in which each ribbon braid is only characterized by three integers : the so - called louis numbers , named after louis kauffman . however , in the 4-valent case a braid is characterized by more integral quantities , as will be seen .",
    "to these ends within this paper , we shall develop a concise algebraic notation of braids which interact actively . within this notation",
    ", the algebraic equivalence moves are defined , and the quantities conserved under these are identified .",
    "finally , the algebra of interactions of actively - interacting braids is developed in detail . from this",
    "the following results are found :    1 .",
    "conserved quantities exist under interactions and we are able to show the form of these conservation laws .",
    "the interaction of two actively - interacting braids results in an actively - interacting braid .",
    "it is worth noting that the algebraic notation proposed in this paper will be used in the parallel papers@xcite .",
    "@xcite extends the algebraic notation and conserved quantities of actively - interacting braids to all stable braids .",
    "based on this , @xcite discovers the discrete transformations of braids , which are mapped to c , p , t , and their combinations .",
    "then @xcite proposes an effective theory of our braid excitations in terms of feynman diagrams , which implies the analogy between actively - interacting braids and bosons .",
    "this implication conversely motivate this paper as well .",
    "we will develop and use an algebraic notation , with , however , keeping a graphic notation wherever necessary for an illustrative purpose .",
    "we adopt the graphical notation we proposed in @xcite .",
    "[ braid ] shows an example of a 3-strand braid in this notation .",
    "more precisely , fig .",
    "[ braid ] is a braid diagram which is a projection of the true 3-strand braid embedded in a topological three manifold .",
    "each spin network can be embedded in various ways , some of which are diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "the projection of a specific embedding of a braid is called a braid diagram ; many braid diagrams are equivalent and belong to the same equivalence class , in the sense that they correspond to the same braid and can be transformed into each other by equivalence moves@xcite .",
    "thus , a braid refers to the whole equivalence class of its braid diagrams .",
    "nevertheless , one can choose a braid diagram of an equivalence class as the representative of the class , we therefore will not distinguish a braid from a braid diagram in the sequel unless an ambiguity arises . besides , a braid always means a 3-strand braid .",
    "among all the stable braids , a small class is called * actively - interacting * , in the sense that they interact onto any other braid as long as the interaction condition is met .",
    "these braids are indeed `` active '' because they also propagate both to its left and right@xcite , so they are able to find other braids to interact . the interactions of passive braids , i.e. braids which are not actively - interacting , are mediated by actively - interacting braids , which implies the possibility that actively - interacting braids behave bosonic@xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "all actively interacting braids happen to be both * completely left- * and * right - reducible * , i.e. such a braid can always be represented by a trivial braid diagram with possibly twists on its three strands and two external edges .",
    "this fact largely reduces the complexity of actively - interacting braids because a trivial braid is fully characterized by its twists and end - nodes states , no crossings to be worried about .",
    "[ trivialbraid](a ) depicts a trivial braid in general .",
    "therefore , in this paper we concentrate on trivial braid diagrams that represent actively - interacting braids . to study these braids in more details and in a more efficient way",
    ", we need a nice algebraic notation .",
    "we found that it is handy to denote a generic trivial braid shown in fig .",
    "[ trivialbraid](a ) algebraically by the notation in eq .",

    "[ trivialbraid](a ) , which are thus named the * internal twists*. the subscript @xmath7 of an internal twist @xmath8 is abstract and has no meaning before its position in the triple is fixed .",
    "so @xmath6=[t_d , t_e , t_f]$ ] means respectively @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will also consider the addition of two triple of twists , i.e. @xmath6+[t_d , t_e , t_f]=[t_a+t_d , t_b+t_e , t_c+t_f]$ ] .",
    "all twists are valued in @xmath11 in units of @xmath12@xcite .",
    "for example , the braid in fig .",
    "[ trivialbraid](b ) is denoted in the algebraic notation by @xmath13 _ { 0}^{-}$ ] .",
    "note that for a trivial braid diagram that interact actively , the set @xmath14 characterizing it is not completely arbitrary but rather has the following constraints",
    ".    1 .   @xmath15",
    ". if a braid is actively - interacting , each of its trivial braid diagrams must have both end - nodes in the same state ( so the braid in fig . [ trivialbraid](b ) does not actively interact ) .",
    "the triple @xmath16 $ ] is not arbitrary ; however , the general pattern of them , ensuring active interaction , has not yet been found .",
    "nevertheless , the algebra formulated in this paper may turn out to be helpful to resolve this problem .",
    "[ h ]    braidrep.jpg",
    "in the first of this series of papers@xcite , we discovered equivalence moves on embedded 4-valent spin networks by which braid diagrams are classified . any braid diagram in an equivalence class",
    "can be chosen to be the representative ; however , for the purpose of studying braid propagation and interaction , we found that each equivalence class of braid diagrams has a unique representative which has two twist - free external edges .",
    "if the unique representative of a braid diagram interacts actively , so does the whole class .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned above , in this paper we are mainly interested in actively interacting braids which have trivial braid diagrams ; hence , it is now more convenient to represent an equivalence class of braid diagrams by trivial braid diagrams in the class which are certainly not unique . in other words , if a trivial braid in our algebraic notation corresponds to a particle , there are many other equivalent ones corresponding to the same particle .",
    "this fundamental degeneracy of a particle is a direct result of diffeomorphism invariance because equivalence moves do not change the diffeomorphism of an embedding .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to find out for any equivalence class of braid diagrams , in an algebraic way adapted to our new algebraic notation , how a trivial representative is related to another in the same class , in particular how the set of quantities characterizing the representative changes , and more importantly what the conserved quantities are .",
    "[ h ]    rotation.jpg    the tools we can utilize have already been introduced in @xcite in detail , namely the rotations .",
    "that is , we can use , e.g. @xmath12 rotations , to take a trivial braid to another . concentrating on trivial braids only , however , we do not expect any crossing to appear because a single rotation on an end - node of a braid diagram creates / annihilates crossings , so we must apply rotations on both end - nodes of a trivial braid simultaneously , such that no crossing arises .",
    "the idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rotation ] .",
    "a remark is that the `` same direction '' we mentioned in the caption of fig .",
    "[ rotation ] is with respect to the surface the braid is projected on , i.e. this piece of paper ; nonetheless , in our definition of rotation with respect to the rotation axis , i.e. the external edges , the rotation @xmath17 of the left end - node and the one of the right end - node are of opposite handedness .",
    "this has two immediate consequences : 1)in fig .",
    "[ rotation](b ) , while the resulted twist on the left external edge is @xmath18 , the one on the right is @xmath19 , a sign difference appears ; and 2)this process creates no crossing and interestingly no extra twists on the three strands of the braid but rather results in the twists @xmath20 $ ] in fig . [ rotation](b ) as a permutation @xmath21 $ ] of the three twists in fig .",
    "[ rotation](a ) .",
    "note that @xmath22 depends also on @xmath23 , the state of the end - nodes before being rotated , which is a special property of rotations in 4-valent case .",
    "we name a whole procedure of this type on a braid a * simultaneous rotation*.    we can describe the action of a simultaneous rotation on a trivial braid algebraically .",
    "we first define an operator for a simultaneous rotation , which acts simultaneously on both end - nodes of braid , by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the amount of rotation valued in units of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath26 , and the signs , which must be opposite in the first and the second subscripts , indicate respectively the handedness of rotations on left and right end - nodes .",
    "the second index of @xmath27 seems a bit redundant ; however , we keep it to make the rotation handedness explicit .",
    "moreover , a state @xmath23 is simply a sign , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , so we let @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 both denoting the opposite of @xmath23 . hence , in general we have @xmath31 _ { t_r}^{s})=_{\\ \\ t_l+ n}^{(-)^ns}\\hspace{-1.5 mm } [ p^s_n(t_a , t_b",
    ", t_c ) ] _ { t_r- n}^{(-)^ns},\\label{rotalgebraic}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 enters the equation because a @xmath12 rotation changes the end - node state once .",
    "when @xmath25 is even , @xmath24 does not change the end - node state of a braid , it is then christened an * even simultaneous rotation * , otherwise it is named an * odd simultaneous rotation*. the rhs of eq .",
    "[ rotalgebraic ] clearly presents the three effect of a simultaneous rotation @xmath24 has three effects on a trivial braid : the change of end - node state depending on @xmath25 , the change of external twists depending on @xmath25 , and the induced permutation @xmath33 on the triple of internal twists , which is determined by the end - node state @xmath23 before the action of @xmath27 , @xmath25 , and the handedness of the rotation on the left end - node .    in view of that all possible rotations on a node of an embedded 4-valent spin network are generated by @xmath12 rotations@xcite , which correspond to @xmath34 , @xmath27 satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 means @xmath25-th power , e.g. @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , eq . [ powerrel ] is actually formal and is not as simple as it appears to be .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that a simultaneous rotation induces a permutation depending on the end - node state before taking the rotation , and that a @xmath12 inverses the end - node state .",
    "more precisely , for example , a rotation @xmath39 is equal to two @xmath40 in a row ; the first @xmath40 induces a permutation , flipping the end - node state from , say @xmath23 , to @xmath41 , so the permutation induced by the second @xmath40 now actually respects @xmath41 rather than @xmath23 .",

    "for a product of permutations , the order of its action on a triple is , in our convention , from right to left .    it is then demanded but sufficient to study a simultaneous rotation of @xmath12 on both end - nodes of a trivial braid to fully understand how a general simultaneous rotation works and to obtain our desired algebraic relations in general .",
