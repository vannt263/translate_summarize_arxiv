    "<S> exploring parameter space we could not identify hexatic phases with isolated dislocations . further decreasing the packing fraction , </S>",
    "<S> the defect ratio @xmath72 increases to a rather high value @xmath73 , signaling a transition to a fluid - like phase .    in order to further scrutinize the nature of order within the crystalline regime we computed the pair correlation function @xmath74 , the corresponding static structure factor @xmath75 , and the correlation functions  @xcite @xmath76 for the hexatic @xmath77 , and the translational @xmath78 order parameter with @xmath79 denoting a reciprocal lattice vector . as discussed above , for @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> , dislocations vanish extremely slowly and , as a consequence , the asymptotic non - equilibrium steady state can not be reached within a computationally accessible time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to obtain steady state results for the correlation functions , we initialized the system in a hexagonal and isotropic configuration ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) ; the corresponding results for simulations starting from an disordered initial state are discussed in the supplemental material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both @xmath75 [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ffts2d](a ) and [ fig : ffts2d](b ) ] and @xmath74 [ see supplemental material s5 ] exhibit a sharp and discrete pattern of hexagonal symmetry , clearly indicating a high degree of translational order . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by @xmath83 being constant over the whole system size [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ffts2d](c ) ] , and the slow decay of the translational correlation function @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay follows a power - law with a very small exponent of about @xmath85 [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ffts2d](d ) , dashed grey line ] , which is difficult to discern from a logarithmic decay . taken together , </S>",
    "<S> these results lead us to conclude that this state of active matter is an _ active crystal _ , free of topological defects with long - range bond - orientational order and quasi - long - range translational order . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the parameter regime of _ polycrystalline _ order , the static structure factor shows the ring - like features of a liquid [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ffts2d](b ) ] ; see also supplemental material  @xcite s5 . </S>",
    "<S> these features are due to the different orientations of the hexagonally ordered patches , as also evident from the exponential decay in @xmath86 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ffts2d](c ) ] and the fast decay of @xmath84 [ figs .  </S>",

    "<S> topological defects are the hallmark of phase transitions in two - dimensional crystalline systems . for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> they drive the successive breaking of translational and bond - orientational order . </S>",
    "<S> our investigations of active crystalline matter at high density have revealed : while defects still play a decisive role , the emerging defect dynamics and phase behavior differ qualitatively from their equilibrium analogues . in active systems , </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium steady states include different types of polycrystalline phases , and a crystalline phase with quasi - long - range translational order but completely devoid of any topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> how the genuine differences of the fluctuations generated by the active particle motion compared to thermal fluctuations permit a defect - free state remains presently unclear and constitutes an interesting future challenge for a continuous theory describing the defect dynamics in polar active matter . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to develop a langevin description for the defect dynamics including interaction potentials that can be directly measured in the simulations . in regimes where defects are sparse </S>",
    "<S> , an alternative promising route might be to employ kinetic approaches  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our predictions can readily be tested by experimental model systems which may for instance be realized using emulsion droplets containing extensile microtubule bundles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they exhibit spontaneous motility when in frictional contact with a hard surface ; depending on the availability of atp their motion can be tuned from passive brownian motion to active persistent random walks . </S>",
    "<S> we envisage that large assemblies of such active soft droplets are ideal model systems to test our theoretical predictions . though the detailed mechanisms of the interaction between the droplets is different from the interaction rules of the agent - based model , we expect that the main features of the dynamics and phase behavior to be generic for active matter at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> another promising experimental system are active colloidal particles . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of photo - activated colloidal particles  @xcite and carbon - coated janus particles  @xcite show various types of pattern and cluster formation </S>",
    "<S> . the versatility of colloidal systems should also allow the design of experiments to explore the dynamics of active matter at high density .    </S>",
