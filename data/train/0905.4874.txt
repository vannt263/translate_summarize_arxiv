    "in @xcite g. plya introduced the question of the visibility in a forest in a discrete lattice case as well as in a random case . he first treated the problem of a person standing at the origin of the regular square lattice of @xmath0 , when identical trees ( discs with constant radius @xmath1 ) are situated at the other points of the lattice . in this framework",
    "he showed that in order to see at a distance @xmath2 the radius @xmath1 should be ( asymptotically when @xmath2 is large ) taken as @xmath3 .",
