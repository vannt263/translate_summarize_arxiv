    "theoretical interest in spherical gravitational wave ( gw ) antennas dates back to the 1970s .",
    "spherical antennas have a greater cross - section than a bar detectors of similar dimensions .",
    "more importantly , they have both omnidirectional and omnipolarization sensitivity , and also the potential to detect the direction of wave provenance .",
    "interest in experimental research into resonant spheres has increased over the past 15 years , and today spherical antennas are recognized to be the new generation of gravitational resonant detectors , to complement existing cylindrical antennas .",
    "two experiments are under way : minigrail in leiden ( holland ) @xcite and the graviton project in sau paulo ( brasil ) @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems today in detecting gravitational waves with resonant spheres is to find the `` best '' location for amplifiers on the detector surface in order to optimize sensitivity . to date",
    ", no theoretical basis has been developed to provide a definitive solution to this problem .",
    "nevertheless many suggestions have recently been proposed , including the uncoupled transducer configuration by zhou and michelson in 1994 , and the phc configuration by lobo and serrano in 1996 ; both are five - resonator configurations , the first including radial and tangential motion of the resonators , the second only radial motion . in addition",
    ", the tiga configuration , proposed by merkowitz and johnson ( 1995 ) , consists of six transducers moving radially , and it enjoys a peculiar symmetry which greatly simplifies equations .",
    "the general theoretical aspects of an ideal simple sphere interacting only with gravitational radiation have already been treated in the literature ( see for example or @xcite ) . in the first part of this paper we will work out briefly some of them and obtain the energies stored in the five fundamental sphere quadrupole modes , as well as their dependence on the incident wave direction and polarization .",
    "+ taking into account of earth s rotation and the detector s location , we will translate the direction dependence into galactic longitude and sidereal time dependence for a source lying in the galactic plane .",
    "we will review the general problem of the spherical detector with radial moving resonators on its surface , again in the case of high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "we then focus our attention on the tiga configuration , finding the oscillation amplitudes for the six transducers as a function of the incident gw direction .",
    "+ with the same method used in the case of the simple sphere without amplifiers , we will find the resonators amplitude dependence on sidereal time and on galactic longitude for a source lying in the galactic plane which emits randomly polarized gw radiation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly sketch some general aspects of the physics of gw resonant detectors without any assumption on the shape of the antenna . in section 3",
    "we focus our attention on the spherical detector , and we present the solutions to the equations of motion followed by the five modes angular and sidereal time sensitivity . in section 4 results of the previous sections",
    "are generalized to the case of the spherical detector coupled to a set of radial transducers .",
    "section 5 contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "we will work with a solid whose density is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the position of an infinitesimal mass element relative to the center of the solid and we call the lam coefficients of the material @xmath2 and @xmath3    we suppose that a gravitational wave hits our detector at the time @xmath4 .",

    "then eq.([z+qeom ] ) becomes [ matrix2 ] m_r((t)+a^t(t))+k_r(t)=. the @xmath116 equations for @xmath133 ( [ matrix2 ] ) and the 5 equations for @xmath131 ( [ matrix1 ] ) can be rewritten as a system of @xmath139 equations [ star ] & & @xmath140 @xmath141 ( t ) + & + & @xmath142 @xmath143 ( t)=@xmath144 .",
    "these are the equations of motion for a system composed of a homogeneous sphere with @xmath116 resonators moving radially on its surface , all interacting with a gw .    in the remainder of this paper , we will solve these equations once a configuration for the positions of the resonators is given .",
    "we first look at what happens in the case with only one resonator ( @xmath145 ) , in order to test the equations by looking at a simple example .",
    "then we move on to the tiga configuration ( @xmath146 ) proposed by merkowitz and johnson in .",
    "+      in this particular case we choose to put only one resonator on the surface of the sphere .",
    "obviously each position is equivalent , but for simplicity let us put the resonator at the north pole of our coordinates system ( or , equivalently , at the south pole because of the symmetry of the problem ) .    in this case , the only nonvanishing component of the @xmath148 matrix @xmath149 is @xmath150 then eq.([star ] ) can be written : @xmath151 & & @xmath152 + + @xmath153 & & @xmath154 = @xmath155.[star1 ] +    it is clear from eq.([star1 ] ) that the only mode of the sphere which couples with our resonator is @xmath156 , while all the others behave as if the resonator was not present .",
    "their equations of motion are the same as given above in eq.([beomsf ] ) .",
    "+ so we can reduce our system of equations to a system of 2 coupled equations with 2 unknowns , taking only the first and the last lines of ( [ star1 ] ) : [ eomqb ] _ 0(t)+_0 ^ 2b_0&=&_0 ^ 2ayq+a^0(t ) + ( t)+_0 ^ 2q(t)&=&-ay_0(t ) .    in eq.([eomqb ] ) we consider that the resonator frequency is perfectly tuned with the fundamental frequency of the sphere , i.e. that @xmath157 and we call @xmath158 the ( small ) ratio between the resonator mass and the sphere mass .    in order to solve eq.([eomqb ] ) we move to fourier coordinates , giving : [ qbzero ] ( ) & = & + _ 0()&=&a^2 ^ 0 ( ) .    as expected , the resonant frequencies @xmath159 for both the coupled quantities are the same , and they are the splitting of the original frequency @xmath160 . + they can be found setting the denominators of eq.([qbzero ] ) equal to zero : _ ^2&=&_0 ^ 2 ( 1ay+)= + & = & _ 0 ^ 2(1 + + o(^2 ) ) .",
    "+    at the frequency @xmath160 we have @xmath161 and @xmath162 is proportional to the ratio between the sphere mass and the resonator mass , so we will have the greatest oscillations if we make the resonator mass as small as possible .    note",
    "that here we neglected the damping of both the coupled oscillators .",
    "this is because we are interested in burst signals , where the time - scale for damping an oscillation of the system is much longer than the time duration of a signal .",
    "taking account of damping means changing eq.([qbzero ] ) to cancel divergences which arise at @xmath163 and make them smoother . in particular , @xmath164 will no longer vanish .",
    "computations adding damping terms are analog and easily done .",
    "figure 4 shows a plot of @xmath165 with a sphere damping of @xmath166 , a resonator damping of @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170    [ fig4 ]     with a sphere damping of @xmath166 , a resonator damping of @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , width=207,height=207 ]    the quantity we are really interested in is the one we can measure , @xmath171 or its squared absolute value . rewriting @xmath172 to show its dependence on @xmath173 , @xmath174 and on the wave direction ( see eq.([g ] ) )",

    "this turns out to be the same angular sensitivity obtained for the cylindrical bar @xcite , for which one finds that sensitivity is optimal for a plane orthogonal to the bar and drops with a factor @xmath175 too .",
    "+ having only one transducer on the sphere surface is a simple example showing that the way resonators are positioned can result in the loss of the main initial properties given by the spherical symmetry of the detector . in order to keep these properties as far as possible",
    ", we have to put more resonators on the sphere in appropriate positions .      with the hope that , in future , we will be able to place resonators moving radially on the sphere surface , and that we will be able to measure experimentally the displacements @xmath133 of these masses , and assuming that all other interactions with the sphere - resonators system are negligible with the exception of gravitational waves , in this section we find the response of @xmath176 in the tiga configuration to a gravitational wave coming from a generic direction @xmath177 in order to do so , we have to solve the equations of motion ( [ star ] ) in fourier space .    in the tiga configuration",
    "there are a total of six resonators : three of them have azimuth angle @xmath178 and @xmath179 and the other three have @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the angles @xmath182 and @xmath183 are between @xmath184 and @xmath185 and they are solutions of the equation @xmath186 with this information , the @xmath149 matrix for this configuration is easily found :    @xmath187    it is important to recall a very usefull property of this matrix : @xmath188 is proportional to the identity @xmath189 matrix . nevertheless , the inverse is not true : @xmath190 has all diagonal values equal to @xmath191 and all non diagonal values equal to @xmath192 it is easily seen that sums over lines or columns are always zero . actually , @xmath190 is a @xmath193 matrix obtained from two @xmath194 matrices , so it is clear that it can not be invertible .",
    "using this property it is straightforward to solve the equations for the so - called @xmath195 @xcite [ p ] ( ) =( ) ,    [ modch ] _ ( ) = , and for @xmath196 _ ( ) = .",
    "the denominators vanish for the two split frequencies ^2_=_0 ^ 2 , so one can rewrite eq.([modch ] ) as _ ( ) & = & - + & = & -^2 a^ , with _ + = , _ -= .",
    "we then have an expression giving a linear combination of resonator displacements as a function of the spherical components of a gravitational wave , or we have each spherical component of @xmath197 as a function of different combinations of displacements .",
    "nevertheless we are also interested in the inverse relation : we want to write each @xmath198 as a combination of the @xmath199 in order to do that we have to express 6 quantities as a function of 5 , which means inverting the matrix @xmath200 a @xmath194 matrix .",
    "we then need a supplementary condition for @xmath133 .",
    "the condition to be added is true for the tiga configuration only , in the case of a high snr .",
    "in that case , the sum of all the six displacements is zero , and this can be seen by looking at the only non - trivial solution of @xmath201 this means that we can add a sixth line to the @xmath149 matrix , a line made up of six unities , and a sixth null component to the @xmath202 vector in eq.([p ] ) .",
    "we will call the new @xmath193 matrix @xmath203 and the new 6-vector @xmath204    @xmath203 is invertible , and we can easily find @xmath133 using @xmath205 getting :    _ 1()&=&_0()+(+1)_1c()+(-1)_2c ( ) ; + _ 2()&=&_0()-(+1)_1c()+(+1)_1s()-(-1)_2c ( ) + & -&(-1)_2s ( ) ; + _ 3()&=&_0()-(+1)_1c()-(+1)_1s()-(-1)_2c ( ) + & + & ( -1)_2s ( ) ; + _ 4()&=&-_0()+(-1)_1c()+(-1)_1s()-(+1)_2c ( ) + & + & ( + 1)_2s ( ) ; + _ 5()&=&-_0()-(-1)_1c()+(+1)_2c ( ) ; + _ 6()&=&-_0()+(-1)_1c()-(-1)_1s()-(+1)_2c ( ) + & -&(+1)_2s ( ) .    taking the squared absolute value , and rewriting @xmath206 as a function of @xmath207 and of the direction @xmath28 ( see eq.([g ] ) )",
    "we can find the explicit behavior of the amplitude of the oscillations for each resonator as a function of the gw direction and polarization .",
    "supposing the source to be randomly polarized , we can replace @xmath208 with the expressions in eq.([pol ] ) , and average over polarizations ( as we have already done for the sphere without resonators ) .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing |_+|^2 & & +     the ratios @xmath209 with @xmath210 , give the sensitivities of the six resonators as a function of the direction of gw provenance .",
    "+ the explicit expression for one of the @xmath211 previously defined is :    & & a_2=^2 + & & + ^2 .",
    "the other five @xmath211 have analogous expressions .",
    "their angular dependence is shown in figure [ fig5 ] , while figure 6 shows the angular dependence of their sum .",
    "note that the sum of the six sensitivities is no longer a constant .",
    "this is because , as we noted before , putting resonators on the surface of the sphere means destroying the original spherical symmetry . nevertheless , the total sensitivity is never zero , so for the direction of a gw from any provenance , there is at least one resonator which will be excited significantly .",
    "omnidirectional sensitivity is then preserved in the tiga configuration , even if omnidirectional symmetry is broken .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we take into account the earth s rotation , as explained in the appendix of @xcite , for a fixed source near the galactic center .",
    "angular sensitivities for the six resonators and for their sum are shown as a function of sidereal hour and galactic longitude .",
    "as before , we take as an example the sphere near leiden , holland ( latitude @xmath97 , longitude @xmath98 ) .",
    "in this work , the general problem of the interaction of a spherical detector with gws has been analyzed , in both the cases of a simple elastic sphere and of a system sphere + transducers .",
    "the five responses of the quadrupole fundamental modes and of resonators motions for the tiga configuration have been found , explicitly identifying angular dependence and , for gw radiation coming from a source in the galactic plane , sidereal time dependence as well .",
    "we find the expected omnidirectional constant sensitivity for the ideal case of a simple sphere . this omnidirectional sensitivity is shown to be preserved in the case of the sphere equipped with tiga transducers , nevertheless it is interesting to note that it is no longer a constant .",
    "this confirms the fact that putting resonators on the surface of the sphere means choosing some favorite directions , breaking the omnidirectional initial symmetry .    for current experiments ,",
    "the results of this paper allow one to predict exactly how the resonators should behave once the position of a candidate source is known .",
    "vice versa , relations between the resonators amplitude and @xmath107 can be inversed and whenever there is a statistically significative reason for thinking that a gravitational wave signal has been received , one can estimate the source direction by looking at the ratio between resonators excitations and at the gw arrival time .",
    "nevertheless , all this work is based on an ideal sphere and ideal radial moving resonators .",
    "deviations and errors on the above predictions exist in a real spherical detector experiment .",
    "in particular , the asymmetry caused by the hole drilled through the center for the suspension system induces a degeneracy of the quadrupole five fundamental modes , which in is estimated to be less than 1@xmath212 .",
    "we have not derived the consequences of this degeneracy in this paper , but it would be interesting to do that in order to better match theoretical predictions with experiments .",
