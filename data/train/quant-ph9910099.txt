    "entanglement is a _ resource _ at the heart of quantum mechanics ; iron in the classical world s bronze age .",
    "it is a key ingredient in effects such as quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , and superdense coding @xcite . to better understand entanglement as a resource , we would like to understand what transformations of an entangled state may be accomplished , when only some restricted class of operations is allowed to accomplish this transformation .",
    "this paradigm , introduced in @xcite , has been very successful in identifying many of the fundamental properties of entanglement .",
    "the best studied class of operations is _ local operations and classical communication _ ( locc )  that is , the two entangled parties may do whatever they wish to their local system , and may communicate classically , but they can not use quantum communication .    this class of transformations has been studied in considerable detail in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize earlier results to study _ approximate _ transformations of one pure state into another . in particular , we obtain a scheme for performing the best possible entanglement transformation , in the sense that the transformation results in a state which is `` nearest '' the desired target state , with respect to a well - motivated measure of distance .",
    "our results show that existing results about entanglement transformation are robust against the effects of slight noise , and quantify exactly how robust .",
    "our results extend and complement recent and independent work by barnum @xcite on approximate transformations with applications to cryptography .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we review the relevant background material .",
    "section  [ sec : main_result ] proves the main result of the paper , an optimal scheme for performing approximate entanglement transformation .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] illustrates our main result by application to some concrete entanglement transformation tasks . in particular , we determine the optimal fidelity of any teleportation scheme that uses a partially entangled pure state as its quantum channel .",
    "section  [ sec : non_local ] introduces the concept of _ non - local fidelity _ between two entangled states , and studies some elementary properties of this measure of distance between two entangled states .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a pure state of a bipartite system shared by alice and bob , and let @xmath1 be its schmidt decomposition@xcite .",
    "( throughout this paper we switch back and forth between the bra - ket notation @xmath2 and the notation @xmath0 without comment . ) without loss of generality we may suppose alice and bob have state spaces of equal dimension , @xmath3 .",
    "all results extend trivially to the case of unequal dimensions .",
    "suppose the parties wish to transform this initial state into a second pure state @xmath4 with schmidt decomposition , @xmath5 that we shall call the _ target _ state , by just acting locally on their subsystems and communicating classically .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for this _ deterministic _ local transformation to be possible , along with an explicit protocol for the conversion , were presented in @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that @xmath0 is locally convertible into @xmath6 in a deterministic manner if and only if the vector @xmath7 is _ majorized _ by the vector @xmath8 , @xmath9 : @xmath10 with equality holding when @xmath11 .",
    "condition  ( [ iff ] ) can be given an equivalent description in terms of the _ entanglement monotones _",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , introduced in @xcite , @xmath14 which are quantities that do not increase , on average , under any local transformation @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath0 can be locally transformed into @xmath6 with certainty if and only if none of these entanglement monotones are increased during the conversion , that is , @xmath15    we suppose from now on that condition ( [ iff ] ) is not satisfied , and that therefore the parties can not locally convert @xmath0 into @xmath6 deterministically , that is , @xmath16 .",
    "what options do they have ?    in some cases ,",
    "namely when @xmath0 has at least as many non - vanishing schmidt coefficients as @xmath6 , the parties can still locally transform @xmath0 into @xmath6 with some non - vanishing probability of success , performing what we shall call a _ conclusive _ conversion .",
    "the optimal _ conclusive _ protocol is the one with the maximal probability @xmath17 that the conversion is successful .",
    "this probability can be shown to be@xcite @xmath18 } \\frac{e_l(\\psi)}{e_l(\\phi ) } , \\label{maxprob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus it is the greatest quantity compatible with the non - increasing character of the entanglement monotones @xmath12 .",
    "we can rephrase this fact by saying that the optimal probability @xmath19 is the greatest weight @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is _ ( weakly ) submajorized _",
    "@xcite ) majorization assumes @xmath22 , which is automatically satisfied due to the normalization of states @xmath0 and @xmath6 , in equation  ( [ weak ] ) the term weak submajorization indicates that the previous equality has turned into an inequality , @xmath23 . ] by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , that is , @xmath26    an appealing feature of _ conclusive _ conversions is that when the protocol succeeds the parties end up sharing exactly the target state @xmath6 they wanted .",
    "this is useful in any situation where alice and bob need the target state _ exactly _ and do not wish to accept a merely _ similar _ outcome , say another state @xmath27 with a reasonably high overlap with @xmath6 .",
    "one may conceive , for instance , that the parties want to perform fully reliable teleportation @xcite . in order to do",
    "so they may try to conclusively convert the initial pure state @xmath0 into an @xmath28-state @xcite  a state of the form latexmath:[\\ ] ] so the vector @xmath21 is majorized by the vector @xmath134 , @xmath135 . according to condition  ( [ iff ] ) the local strategy presented in @xcite",
    "will indeed allow the parties to obtain the state @xmath27 from @xmath0 with certainty .",
    "now , let us define positive quantities @xmath136 then the fidelity between the final state @xmath27 and the target state @xmath6 reads , in terms of the initial and target states , @xmath137    without loss of generality , lemma  1 allows us to assume that any other possible final state @xmath138 has the same schmidt basis as the target state @xmath6 and squared schmidt coefficients @xmath139 , so by the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , @xmath142 where @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) have been defined in equations  ( [ l1])-([l2 ] ) .",
    "now , recall that @xmath145 , and that the local and deterministic character of the conversion @xmath146 implies that @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "we can therefore define @xmath149 as @xmath150 the condition @xmath151 implies that @xmath152 for each @xmath43 .",
    "we may rewrite equation  ( [ ineq ] ) in terms of the @xmath153 and the @xmath154 introduced in equation  ( [ ai ] ) as @xmath155 our interest is in the behaviour of @xmath156 as a function of @xmath157 .",
    "we will show that in the allowed parameter region @xmath158 is maximized when @xmath159 .",
    "a direct computation shows that the ( tridiagonal ) matrix of second derivatives of @xmath156 , @xmath160 , is negative definite in the region @xmath161 defined by the constraints @xmath152 and @xmath162 , which contains all relevant situations compatible with @xmath163 .",
    "next , note that @xmath164 by construction @xmath165 ( compare equations  ( [ l1])-([l2 ] ) and ( [ ai])-([bi ] ) ) , so @xmath166 it follows that the maximum of @xmath167 occurs at @xmath168 , that is , when the final state @xmath138 is precisely the state @xmath27 as defined in equations  ( [ xi])-([defixi ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude :    * theorem 3 : * the maximal fidelity @xmath169 achievable in a faithful local transformation of the initial pure state @xmath0 into the target pure state @xmath6 is given by equation  ( [ optfid ] ) , @xmath170 the most faithful protocol consists in a deterministic conversion of @xmath0 into the pure state @xmath27 as defined in equations  ( [ xi])-([defixi ] ) .",
    "the next few sections apply theorem  3 to several problems of entanglement transformation .",
    "section  [ subsec : concentration ] finds the most faithful protocol for performing a special type of entanglement transformation known as _ entanglement concentration _ , in which a large number of partially entangled states are transformed into bell pairs .",
    "this result is then applied to determine the most faithful teleportation protocol via any given pure quantum state .",
    "section  [ subsec : dilution ] finds the most faithful protocol for performing the reverse procedure to concentration , _",
    "entanglement dilution_. section  [ subsec : comparison ] compares the most faithful transformation with the optimal conclusive transformation , and concludes that in general they are different .",
    "section  [ subsec : robust ] explains how our results can be used to demonstrate the robustness against noise of entanglement transformation protocols for pure states , and section  [ subsec : robust_catalysis ] explains this in the special case of entanglement catalysis .",
    "an _ entanglement concentration protocol _",
    "@xcite is a strategy for obtaining maximally entangled states from some partially entangled initial ( pure ) state @xmath0 using only locc . in the original formulation of this concept , due to bennett , bernstein , popescu and schumacher @xcite , many ( @xmath32 ) copies of an @xmath171-dimensional state @xmath0 are available , and the goal is to obtain the largest number of @xmath3-states in the asymptotic limit where @xmath172 .",
    "more recently , the optimal way to conclusively concentrate the entanglement of a _ single copy _ of @xmath0 has also been obtained @xcite .    in this section",
    "we solve the same problem from the point of view of faithful conversions . in this case , the goal is to determine the local strategy that maximizes the fidelity between the single copy of @xmath0 and the maximally entangled  @xmath3-state \" @xmath173 .",
    "it turns out that the optimal strategy in this case is essentially to do nothing at all .",
    "the only requirement is to apply the local unitary rotations that align the schmidt components of @xmath0 to those of @xmath173 , in the manner implied by lemma  1 .",
    "this result can be shown using equations  ( [ l1])-([defixi ] ) .",
    "however , a simpler derivation can be obtained from the following argument .",
    "first , for any pure state @xmath0 with schmidt coefficients @xmath174 , consider the function @xmath175 as has been pointed out by m.  horodecki  @xcite , @xmath176 is a unitarily invariant , concave function of the reduced density matrix @xmath177 . following theorem 2 in @xcite , it is therefore an entanglement monotone for pure states .",
    "in fact , lemma  1 shows that @xmath178 is the greatest fidelity with respect to @xmath173 that is achievable from @xmath0 by local unitary rotations .",
    "now , following lemma 2 , let @xmath27 be the most faithful approximation of @xmath173 obtainable from @xmath0 by locc . by definition then , @xmath179 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath176 is an entanglement monotone , we must also have @xmath180 .",
    "these quantities are therefore equal , which implies that the optimally faithful strategy can be achieved using only local unitary rotations .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath176 can also have another interpretation .",
    "it is equivalent to the _ robustness of entanglement _",
    "@xmath181 , an entanglement monotone that was comprehensively studied in @xcite .",
    "@xmath181 is defined as the minimal amount of separable noise that has to be mixed with state @xmath0 in order to wash out its quantum correlations completely . for pure states ,",
    "its value reads @xmath182",
    ".    an important consequence of determining @xmath176 is that it also allows us to determine the optimal _ fidelity of teleportation _ via @xmath0 .",
    "recall that perfect teleportation of an unknown @xmath3-dimensional state can be realized only if an `` @xmath3-state '' is shared between alice and bob @xcite . for a more general initially shared state @xmath0 , one must admit some imperfection in the procedure . as with entanglement transformations , it is possible to consider two approaches to imperfect teleportation : on the one hand , conclusive teleportation strategies seek to maximize the likelihood of achieving ideal teleportation , but also allow for the possibility of failure @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "faithful strategies seek to maximize the so - called fidelity of teleportation .",
    "for any given teleportation strategy @xmath183 , this quantity is naturally defined @xcite as the average overlap between alice s initial state @xmath6 and the final teleported state obtained by bob @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the trace - preserving quantum operation that maps the initial state onto the teleported one ( a construction for this operation may be found in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a connection has been found between this quantity and faithful entanglement concentration procedures @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , for any given initial state @xmath33 ( pure or mixed ) in @xmath62-dimensional hilbert space , the maximum value of @xmath186 over _ all possible _ teleportation protocols implemented using locc is given by @xmath187 here , @xmath188 is precisely the maximum fidelity that can be achieved between @xmath33 and an `` @xmath3-state '' under a trace - preserving quantum operation implemented via local operations and classical communication . in general , it is not yet known how to calculate this quantity .",
    "however , in the case of a pure initial state @xmath189 , its value is the one found in equation ( [ eqtn : opt_concfid ] ) above .",
    "the maximum fidelity of teleportation via @xmath0 is then also immediately determined via equation ( [ eqtn : telepfid ] ) : @xmath190    a ` most faithful ' teleportation protocol that achieves this limit has also been described in @xcite . for any initial state @xmath33 ,",
    "its first step requires transforming @xmath33 into the most faithful achievable approximation of an @xmath3-state . in the case of a pure state @xmath0",
    ", we now know that this is done merely by the schmidt - basis alignment described above .",
    "the remainder of the protocol requires then only a so - called ` @xmath191 twirling ' @xcite of the state ( resulting in a werner state @xcite ) , followed by applying the standard teleportation procedure @xcite .",
    "we therefore have now an explicit protocol for realizing optimally faithful teleportation via pure states .",
    "we now consider the reverse process to entanglement concentration , entanglement dilution @xcite . in this case , the parties start out with some @xmath28-state @xmath192 and aim at obtaining a final , less entangled state @xmath6 , constituted of @xmath32 copies of some smaller - dimensional state @xmath193 , i.e. @xmath194 . if the number of non - vanishing schmidt coefficients of @xmath193 is greater than @xmath195 , then this exact transformation is not possible at all  not even with only some probability of success  since @xmath6 has fewer schmidt components than @xmath0 , @xmath196 @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is interesting to consider the most faithful approximation to @xmath197 that can be achieved .",
    "let @xmath198 .",
    "the most faithful approximation @xmath27 to @xmath6 that can be obtained from @xmath192 by locc is determined using equations  ( [ l1])-([defixi ] ) as follows : from equation  ( [ l1 ] ) , we have @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "equation  ( [ l2 ] ) gives @xmath201 , @xmath202 .",
    "it follows that @xmath203 and the corresponding optimal fidelity  ( [ eqtn : opt_fid_2 ] ) simply reads @xmath204 in other words , the best approximation to the target state @xmath6 is the state of highest norm that can be obtained by projecting @xmath6 onto an @xmath205-dimensional subspace .    in @xcite",
    "the problem of optimal entanglement dilution was solved in the asymptotic limit @xmath206 . in this regime ,",
    "the dilution procedure can actually be realized with 100% efficiency . the protocol realizing this is well - defined for any finite values of @xmath207 .",
    "it consists essentially in identifying the subspace of @xmath6 spanned by its @xmath28 largest schmidt components and then using the @xmath28-state @xmath192 to teleport half of this over to bob .",
    "it can be easily verified that the resulting fidelity with respect to @xmath6 is given precisely by the expression above .",
    "this then shows that not only does this protocol approach fidelity 1 as @xmath206 , but it is also optimal for any finite values of these quantities .",
    "suppose alice and bob s aim is to transform the state @xmath0 into the state @xmath6 .",
    "we have found the optimal fidelity with which this transformation can be accomplished .",
    "a natural question to ask is how this faithful conversion strategy compares with the optimal conclusive strategy  the one that maximizes the probability of successful conversion @xcite .",
    "a first observation is that the latter is in general _ not _ also the most faithful strategy .",
    "this follows since the optimal conclusive strategy will not usually succeed with 100% probability , whereas lemma  2 shows that the fidelity with respect to @xmath6 is always maximized by means of a deterministic transformation .",
    "a simple example is the case of a 2-qubit system initially in a partially entangled state @xmath208 , with @xmath209 . as we have seen above , the most faithful strategy for converting it into the maximally entangled 2-state",
    "is simply to do nothing , which corresponds to a fidelity of @xmath210 . on the other hand , the optimal conclusive transformation , which succeeds with probability @xmath211 @xcite , results in an average fidelity of @xmath212 , which is strictly less than was achieved by the most faithful transformation .",
    "we also note the surprising fact that , in all cases , realizing the most faithful conversion does not diminish in any way alice and bob s chances of conclusively obtaining the target state .",
    "this follows since the final state @xmath27 in equations  ( [ xi])-([defixi ] ) is precisely the same as the intermediate state @xmath213 in the optimal conclusive protocol presented in @xcite , equations ( 10)-(14 ) .",
    "this means then that no probability of success is lost during a most faithful conversion , that is , @xmath214 in other words , the parties may postpone their decision on whether or not they wish to risk their initial state in a conclusive transformation into @xmath6 , while obtaining already the most faithful approximation to @xmath6 .",
    "up to this point , our discussion has assumed that the initial state @xmath0 shared by alice and bob is pure .",
    "suppose , however , that @xmath0 is corrupted a little before it is made available to alice and bob , so they receive a density matrix @xmath33 instead .",
    "what can we say about the possibility of transforming @xmath33 into a target state @xmath6 ? this section establishes upper and lower bounds on the fidelity with which the transformation @xmath215 may be accomplished , and the next section explains how these results may be used to analyze the robustness of effects like entanglement catalysis@xcite .",
    "our results are most easily presented using the _ trace distance _ , a metric on hermitian operators defined by @xmath216 , where @xmath217 denotes the positive square root of the hermitian matrix @xmath218 .",
    "ruskai @xcite has shown that the trace distance contracts under physical processes . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath219 are any two density operators , and if @xmath220 and @xmath221 denote states after some physical process represented by the ( trace - preserving ) quantum operation @xmath222 occurs , then @xmath223 we will use @xmath224 to denote the trace distance between the density matrices @xmath225 and @xmath226 . for pure states the trace distance and the fidelity are related by a simple formula , @xmath227    returning to the problem of entanglement transformation , suppose @xmath0 is a pure state that we wish to transform into a pure state @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath228 denote the minimal trace distance that can be achieved by such a transformation ; this is easily found by substituting  ( [ eqtn : opt_fid_2 ] ) into  ( [ eqtn : trace_fidelity ] ) .",
    "we will provide upper and lower bounds on @xmath229 , the minimal trace distance to @xmath6 that may be achieved by a protocol starting with the state @xmath33 , and using local operations and classical communication .",
    "suppose we start with the state @xmath33 , and apply the protocol that most faithfully transforms @xmath0 into @xmath6 .",
    "define @xmath230 to be the result of applying this protocol to @xmath33 , and @xmath231 the result of applying the protocol to @xmath0 . then",
    "since this is just one possible protocol , not necessarily optimal , for transforming @xmath33 into @xmath6 , we must have @xmath232 by the metric property of the trace distance , @xmath233 but by the contractivity property  ( [ eqtn : contractivity ] ) we have @xmath234 , and the choice of protocol ensures that @xmath235 . thus  ( [ eqtn : metric ] ) implies @xmath236 which is an upper bound on @xmath229 in terms of the easily calculated quantities @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "a lower bound on @xmath229 may be obtained by a similar technique .",
    "suppose @xmath239 and @xmath240 are the states obtained from @xmath33 and @xmath0 , respectively , by applying the optimal transformation protocol for obtaining @xmath6 from @xmath33 .",
    "then we must have @xmath241 by the metric property , @xmath242 . by contractivity , @xmath243 , and by the choice of protocol , @xmath244 .",
    "thus @xmath245 which provides a lower bound on @xmath229 . combining upper and lower bounds on @xmath229 into a single equation we have the useful inequality @xmath246 we note in passing that the same method may be used to prove that for any quadruple of quantum states @xmath247 the following more general inequality holds , @xmath248 this inequality is of especial use in the case where , for example , @xmath249 and @xmath250 are pure states , since then theorem  3 allows @xmath251 to be calculated explicitly , and  ( [ eqtn : mixed_bounds_2 ] ) then bounds the quantity @xmath252 , which we do not know how to calculate exactly in general .      as an illustration of the usefulness of the inequality  ( [ eqtn : mixed_bounds ] ) , we study the robustness of the phenomenon of _ entanglement catalysis _ @xcite under the presence of initial noise .",
    "first let us recall the nature of this effect : it is sometimes the case that , although alice and bob can not deterministically transform @xmath0 into @xmath6 by local operations and classical communication , there exist _ catalyst _ entangled states @xmath253 such that @xmath254 can be transformed into @xmath255 by local operations and classical communication . more generally , partial catalyst states may exist that improve the efficiency of the conversion from @xmath0 into @xmath6 , although not to @xmath256 . in @xcite",
    "this effect was studied from the point of view of conclusive conversions : partial catalysts were seen to improve the probability of conclusively obtaining @xmath6 from @xmath0 .",
    "another point of view , along the lines of the present work , is to regard them as reducing the minimal trace distance achievable in a faithful conversion : @xmath257 we can now ask whether this improvement survives in the presence of a distortion of the states involved .",
    "suppose for instance that the initial state and catalyst are subject to some noise , so that instead of @xmath254 we have in fact a mixed state @xmath33 which is merely close to @xmath258 .",
    "taking the trace distance @xmath259 as a measure of the magnitude of the noise , we can then ask how small @xmath260 has to be if the catalytic effect is to be preserved .    from equation  ( [ eqtn : mixed_bounds ] ) we have @xmath261",
    "now let @xmath262 be the reduction in the trace distance achievable using the catalyst @xmath253 when there is no initial error . then",
    "as long as @xmath263 we still obtain @xmath264 , and therefore a catalytic enhancement of the fidelity obtainable via locc is still present .",
    "we can use the optimality result of theorem  3 to define notions of fidelity and distance on the space of quantum states that measures how different the `` non - local '' properties of those states are .",
    "for example , we define the _ non - local fidelity _ between pure states @xmath2 and @xmath4 by @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the optimal fidelity for transforming @xmath0 to @xmath6 by locc , and @xmath267 is the optimal fidelity , in general different , for transforming @xmath6 into @xmath0 by locc .",
    "the non - local fidelity quantifies the similarity in quantum correlations present in @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "the non - local fidelity can be turned into a metric by using the _ trace distance_. recall that the trace distance between density matrices @xmath33 and @xmath219 is defined by @xmath268 . for pure states",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath6 the trace distance is related to the fidelity by the formula  ( [ eqtn : trace_fidelity ] ) , which we reproduce here for convenience : @xmath269 analogous to the non - local fidelity we may define the non - local trace distance , @xmath270",
    "this is a metric on the space of pure states of a bipartite system , where we agree to identify two states if they have the same schmidt coefficients . to see the metric property , note that the non - local distance is manifestly symmetric , and that @xmath271 if and only if @xmath272 and @xmath273 , which we know is true if and only if @xmath0 and @xmath6 have the same schmidt coefficients .",
    "all that remains is to prove the triangle inequality , @xmath274 to prove this , we use a construction illustrated in figures  [ fig : metric_1 ] and  [ fig : metric_2 ] . without loss of generality , we suppose that @xmath275 where @xmath6 is the best possible approximation to @xmath276 that may be obtained from @xmath277 by local operations and classical communication",
    ". furthermore , let @xmath278 be the best approximation to @xmath279 that can be obtained from @xmath277 by local operations and classical communication , and let @xmath280 be the best approximation to @xmath276 that can be obtained from @xmath279 by local operations and classical communication .",
    "then @xmath281 furthermore , let @xmath282 be the ensemble of states that results when the protocol used to transform @xmath279 into @xmath280 is applied to @xmath278 instead .",
    "define @xmath283 .",
    "then since @xmath33 may be obtained from @xmath277 by local operations and classical communication we have @xmath284 where we applied the metric property of the trace distance on the second line .",
    "we again use the result of ruskai @xcite stating that @xmath285 never decreases if the same trace - preserving quantum operation is applied to each argument , so @xmath286 .",
    "combining this observation with  ( [ eqtn : trees ] ) and then applying  ( [ eqtn : thunderbolts ] ) gives @xmath287 which is the triangle inequality  ( [ eqtn : triang ] ) .",
    "analogous constructions may be carried out for the mixed state case .",
    "unfortunately , general conditions for transforming one mixed state to another by local operations and classical communication are not yet known , so we can not evaluate the non - local distance or non - local fidelity in this instance .",
    "( note however that equation  ( [ eqtn : mixed_bounds ] ) does allow one to prove bounds on the general non - local distance . ) in the case of mixed states there are inequivalent measures of distance available for use in the definition of non - local distance , such as the trace distance and the bures distance @xcite .",
    "in general , any good measure of distance for quantum states can be used to define a good measure of non - local distance , provided it has a contractivity property analogous to that for the trace distance ( which , for example , the bures distance has ) .",
    "we have found the optimal approximate schemes for transforming one pure entangled state into another using local operations and classical communication .",
    "these results have been used to determine the best possible schemes for entanglement concentration and dilution , to determine the optimal teleportation fidelity that may be achieved when imperfect pure state entanglement is available , and to obtain bounds on how well entanglement can be transformed in the presence of a small amount of noise in the initial state .",
    "this in turn allows us to estimate how robust surprising effects such as entanglement catalysis are against such small perturbations .",
    "furthermore , we defined a _",
    "non - local fidelity _ to measure the difference in the entanglement present in two quantum states .",
    "this quantity is not affected by local unitary changes to the system , and can be used to define interesting non - local metrics on the space of entangled states .",
    "we believe that these results shed considerable light on the ongoing effort to develop the notion of entanglement as a physical resource that can be employed in a wide variety of information processing tasks . in particular ,",
    "an understanding of approximation is crucial to the analysis of proposals for tasks of practical interest , like the cryptographic protocol recently proposed by barnum @xcite , whose security depends upon the difficulty of performing certain entanglement transformations .",
