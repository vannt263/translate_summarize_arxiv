    "during the last two decades , honeycomb - structured materials became very important in nanoscience .",
    "their unique orbital symmetry gives rise to exceptional properties in these quasi-1d carbon - based systems , such as fullerenes , nanotubes , graphene and its nanoribbons @xcite . among them , graphene is doubtless the most studied at present time , due to its potential applications and the fact that is the first bidimensional material of one - atom thickness @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interest on fabrication , characterization and study of silicon nanostructures keeps continously expanding .",
    "the possibility of having a graphene - like structure , the silicene , has been studied theoretically already for several years @xcite . from an electronic point of view",
    ", silicene could be equivalent to graphene , having the advantage of an easy integration to the present electronics , which is based on bulk silicon .",
    "moreover , its borders do not react with oxygen @xcite . nevertheless , it has a drawback .",
    "less versatile than carbon , silicon hardly hibridizes to @xmath0 bonds .",
    "therefore , syntesis and growth of silicene is extremely hard @xcite .",
    "only recently , silicon structures resembling graphene , such as self - assembled silicene nanoribbons @xcite and silicene sheets deposited on silver crystals @xcite have been reported .",
    "growth on a zrb@xmath1 substrate has been succesful @xcite . for the hexagonal lattice ,",
    "the lattice constant @xmath2 for si and ge , as reported by lebgue and eriksson @xcite are 3.860   and 4.034    respectively , which are larger than the one for graphene ( 2.46  ) since these atoms have larger radii .",
    "@xcite showed that the bonding distance si - si ( ge - ge ) is 2.25 (2.38  ) .",
    "with four _ sp _ electrons in valence band , si and ge are chemically very similar to c , in spite of this they behave very differently .",
    "the difference in the chemistry exhibited by carbon and silicon can be traced to the difference in their @xmath3 bonding capabilities .",
    "first , the energy difference between the valence _ s _ and _ p _ orbitals for carbon is about twice that for silicon ( si : e@xmath4-e@xmath5 = 5.66 ev , c : e@xmath6-e@xmath7=10.60 ev ) @xcite ) ; as a result , silicon tends to utilize all three of its valence _",
    "orbitals , resulting in _ _ sp__@xmath8 hybridization while , in contrast the relatively large hybridization energy for carbon implies that this will `` activate '' one valence _ p _",
    "orbital at a time , as requirements the bonding situation , giving rise , in turn , to _ sp _ , _ _",
    "sp__@xmath9 , and _ _ sp__@xmath8 hybridizations .",
    "second , the @xmath3-@xmath3 overlap decreases by roughly an order of magnitude in going from carbon to silicon due to the significant increase in atomic distance , resulting in much weaker @xmath3 bonding for silicon in comparison with that for carbon . hence ,",
    "si = si are in general much weaker than c = c bonds .",
    "@xcite establish the theoretical similarities and differences between si and c nanotubes .",
    "for the silicon nanotubes ( sints ) studied , they obtained a cohesive energy value of 0.83 ev / atom , which is higher than the total energy per atom for the diamond - like structure .",
    "considering that the cohesive energy for the si bulk in diamond structure is 4.63 ev / atom , the energies for the studied nanotubes are only 82% of the bulk . comparing with carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) that have around of 99% of the cohesive energy they would have in perfect crystalline graphite , these results help to understand the diffilculty to produce the sints and , especially , silicene .",
    "@xcite also studied silicon nanotubes and their results suggest that silicon nanotubes can in principle be formed , however , the energy - minimized sints adopt a severely puckered structure ( with a corrugated surface ) with si - si distances ranging from 1.85 to 2.25  .",
    "some silicene properties have been predicted theoretically to be very similar to their corresponding in graphene @xcite .",
    "ab - initio calculations revealed that silicene clusters can be used in field - effect transistors and hydrogene storage , and their electronic properties have been studied using molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "ince and erkoc ( ie ) determined the structure of silicene nanoribbons of different widths and lenghts @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report results on structural properties of a bidimensional array of si atoms . by means of molecular dynamics , we determine the radial distribution function for different temperatures and densities .",
    "we analyze the effect of the two - body potential considering a lennard - jones potential with two sets of parameters , the ie parameters and those suggested by stillinger and weber ( sw ) for bulk si @xcite .",
    "our calculations represent a description of free - standing silicene , since ab - initio studies have shown that two dimensional honeycombe structures for si and ge are stable @xcite .",
    "our model provides insight to understanding the structural properties of silicene . taking into account potentials developed for silicon or interactions with the substrate for the case of adsorbed nanosheets will provide an improved description . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe our calculation method and the used parameters . in section 3",
    "the results are analized and finally , conclusions close this report .",
    "we perform molecular 2d dynamics simulations .",
    "si atoms interact via lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath10 \\ , .\\ ] ]    the first term is a positive ( repulsive ) short - range interaction , related to the electrostatic repulsion .",
    "the second term , a negative contribution , is the van der waals potential .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) corresponds to the energy ( spatial range ) scale .",
    "lj potential works well for rare gases and poorly for materials where many - body effects are important , like metals or semiconductors . nevertheless , it can give a rough description and has been used as the two - body part in si nanostructures @xcite .",
    "details of our approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "we compare calculations performed with two sets of parameters shown in table [ parameters ] .",

    "this fcc surface is characteristic for 2d honeycomb structures , with the difference that it has an extra atom at the center of each hexagon .",
