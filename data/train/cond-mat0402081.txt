    "the recent achievement of bose - einstein condensates ( bec)@xcite has strongly renewed and restimulated the numerous works and theories on quantum gases / liquids . by their lower densities , their larger healing lengthes , the bec present important advantages compared to the traditional helium superfluids , regardless the fundamental interest of the bose - einstein transition itself .",
    "one of the striking properties of these quantum gases / liquids is the quantization of the vorticity@xcite .",
    "it manifests through the formation of vortices whose circulation is quantified in units of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of an atom of the gas and @xmath2 is the planck constant .",
    "such vortices have been observed in bec by two different procedures these last years@xcite .",
    "firstly@xcite by rotating the bec through laser techniques .",
    "this experiment is the analogy of the famous rotating bucket of superfluid helium where the first direct observation of quantized vortices was obtained@xcite .",
    "the vortices appear suddenly as the rotation frequency increases , either one by one , or by group , depending on the experimental procedure .",
    "the other experiment@xcite exploits the dynamical transition to vortex shedding of an accelerated superflow@xcite .",
    "experimentally , to achieve the be condensation the atoms of the condensate have to be placed in an optical trap which creates an effective ( mostly harmonic ) attractive potential .",
    "thus , in the above experiments only single charged vortices were observed .",
    "no multicharged vortices ( called giant vortex of charge @xmath3 or @xmath3-vortex later on ) were detected .",
    "however , by imposing specific initial states , it has been possible to observe metastable long - lived giant vortices experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is in fact well known that multicharged vortices are always dynamically and thermodynamically unstable in homogenous and infinitely large quantum liquids@xcite .",
    "when the system is submitted to a trap potential , the situation becomes more tricky since the potential encourages vortex merging while the vortices try to expand the condensate .",
    "for bec in harmonic trap , variational stability analysis suggests indeed the existence of a critical frequency above which the giant vortex should be energetically favoured to the single vortices lattice@xcite .",
    "but this frequency is found higher than the frequency of the quadratic trapping potential . at such speed ,",
    "the condensate is unstable since the centrifugal force overcomes the trap confinement .",
    "this explains why no stable giant vortices have been observed until now in rotating bec , where only harmonic trap were experimentally considered .",
    "this peculiar property of harmonic confinement does not actually prevent the stability of giant vortices for stronger trap potentials .",
    "in fact different groups have shown numerically and argued analytically that giant vortices are stable for high enough rotation if the trap potential is taken stronger than harmonic@xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have exhibited these giant vortices and some coexistence diagramms were even obtained@xcite , although no clear stability arguments were presented . in the other",
    "work@xcite the stability analysis was only performed in the framework of wigner - seitz approximation of a vortex lattice .",
    "adequate strong trap potentials can be experimentally achieved thanks for example to laguerre - gaussian laser beams@xcite but the observation of stable giant vortices remains still to be done .    in this note",
    ", we address the stability analysis of the giant vortices for the rotating cylinder .",
    "we use numerical simulations for two - dimensional systems subject to rotation @xmath4 , assuming translational invariance in the @xmath5-direction .",
    "the giant vortex formation is shown for illustration in a rotating bec with quartic potential but we restrict thereafter our treatment to the case of an infinite cylindrical potential .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum bose gas in the rotating frame in two dimensions is described through the dimensionless gross - pitaevski ( g - p ) equation@xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the condensate wave function normalized to unity : @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the position vector @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 the corresponding cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the nonlinear strength @xmath13 is related to the product of the particle number per unit length @xmath14 with the s - wave scattering length @xmath15 .",
    "this dimensionless equation has been in fact deduced from the usual model using a typical length scale @xmath16 that is defined by the trap properties .",
    "consequently the length , energy and time in equation ( [ gp ] ) are given in units of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath2 the planck constant and @xmath1 the particle mass ) .",
    "the usual harmonic potential @xmath19 leads to @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "below we restrict our work to only two traps geometry .",
    "firstly for illustration a quartic potential @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 and @xmath21 again . this potential has a smooth behavior and describes a stronger trap potential than the usual harmonic potential of the experiments .",
    "the other potential models a quantum liquid entrapped in a cylindrical bucket of radius @xmath24 . with @xmath25 the potential is described by @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "it corresponds to the well - known experiment on superfluid helium where quantized vortices have been first vizualized@xcite . note that equation ( [ gp ] ) admits only two control parameters for a given potential : the interaction coefficient @xmath29 and the angular frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamics derives from a free energy @xmath31 through : @xmath32 with :    @xmath33    stable equilibrium solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) correspond to local minima of @xmath31 .",
    "the ground state is determined among the stable equilibrium solution as the one with the lowest energy .",
    "stable equilibrium states of the condensate can be reached numerically through the dissipative dynamics of the ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "formally it corresponds to an imaginary time evolution of the gp equation ( [ gp ] ) :    @xmath34    we have introduced the chemical potential @xmath35 as the lagrangian multiplier ensuring that the norm of @xmath36 is unity .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed in two space dimensions up to @xmath37 grid points .",
    "we have checked that numerical precision is not significantly affected by higher spatial discretizations for our range of parameters .",
    "both fast fourier transform ( fft ) or finite difference methods have been used for spatial derivatives and again no dramatic changes were noticed between these schemes . the relative error in the normalization of the wave function",
    "was controlled to be below @xmath38 and the precision for @xmath35 is better than @xmath38 .",
    "to illustrate the formation of giant vortices , we follow numerically an equilibrium solution as @xmath30 evolves .",
    "we start at @xmath39 with the ground state ( vortex free solution ) and we increase suddenly @xmath30 of a small increment @xmath40 .",
    "we retrieve an equilibrium state through the imaginary time dynamics ( [ gl ] ) and the procedure is then successively reproduced . both the quartic and the hard - wall potentials are considered .",
    "we first present the results for the quartic potential with @xmath41 ( figures [ quar0 ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ quar0].a ) shows the ground state solution , vortex - free at @xmath39 .",
    "this solution survives without any change until @xmath42 where suddenly four vortices enter into the cloud ( figure [ quar0].b ) .",
    "they are well separated and form a square lattice .",
    "we observe also a spatial expansion of the cloud due to centrifugal effects .",
    "as @xmath30 increases further on(figure [ quar0 ] c ) ) , the four vortices approach slowly the center of the trap . in this case the full merging of the four vortices is attained at @xmath43 ( figure [ quar0 ] d ) ) , just before new vortices enter the cloud ( at @xmath44 ) .",

    "the grid size is @xmath51 and a pseudo - spectral method is used .",
    "the darker the color , the higher the density so that the vortices appear as white hole in the condensate . [ quar0],width=604 ]    a similar situation is observed for a superfluid in a cylindrical trap although in that case the condensate can not expand when vortices are nucleated .",
    "indeed we account for the infinite hard wall potential by imposing as boundary conditions @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "figure ( [ snap0 ] ) shows the density @xmath54 of the solution of equation ( [ gl ] ) as @xmath30 increases for @xmath55 .",
    "the nucleation of four vortices occurs at @xmath56 ( figure ( [ snap0 ] a ) ) from the vortex free solution .",
    "further increments of @xmath30 lead to the convergence of the four vortices towards the center of the trap(figure ( [ snap0 ] b ) ) . but",
    "a different scenario arises here compared to the dynamics observed for the quartic potential .",
    "indeed , before the four vortices collapse in a single @xmath57-vortex , four new vortices are nucleated in the cloud at @xmath58(figure ( [ snap0 ] c ) ) . the condensate is now composed of a lattice of eight well separated vortices",
    ". then new increases of @xmath30 lead eventually to the merging into a giant @xmath59-vortex at @xmath60 ( figure ( [ snap0 ] d ) ) . above this rotation ,",
    "when new vortices are nucleated , they are immediatly absorbed by the giant vortex .",
    "this persistence of giant vortices for increasing frequencies has been in fact observed for all the numerical simulations that we have performed .",
    ", for @xmath46 a ) @xmath61 , b ) @xmath62 , c ) @xmath63 , and d ) @xmath64 .",
    "the grid size is @xmath65 and the increment of the angular frequency is @xmath66 .",
    "the color scale goes from blue for zero density to red for the maximum density .",
    "the vortices appear as blue holes on the density field .",
    "[ snap0],width=604 ]",
    "by sake of simplicity , the stability analysis is performed for the cylindrical wall trap potential .",
    "we want to address the conditions under which conditions a @xmath3-vortex is a local minimum of the free energy ( [ fener ] ) .",
    "we determine firstly the giant @xmath3-vortex state by seeking solutions of the form :    @xmath67    the trivial symetry of the problem @xmath68 with @xmath69 makes us only consider later on the case @xmath70 . from the free - energy principle , to be an equilibrium solution @xmath71 has to satisfy :    @xmath72    @xmath73 is introduced again as the lagrangian multiplier for the norm constraint @xmath74 , where @xmath75 stands for the usual scalar product .",
    "the external potential term is replaced by the boundary condition @xmath52 for @xmath53 so that this potential term is everywhere zero in the equation .",
    "we observe from the preceeding equation ( [ eqaxi ] ) that the giant vortex solution is independant of @xmath30 which only intervenes in the coefficient @xmath76 .",
    "these solutions are thus equilibrium states for all frequencies @xmath30 regardless their stability .",
    "the free energy of the vortex writes :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the kinetic energy and @xmath79 the nonlinear energy term .",
    "@xmath80 is the total energy of the vortex solution .",
    "the @xmath3-vortex function @xmath71 is found as before through the dissipative dynamics of the axisymetric ginzburg - landau equation :    @xmath81    so that the equilibrium solutions @xmath71 are local mimina of the free energy @xmath82 .",
    "figure ( [ axivort ] a ) ) shows the density @xmath83 of the solution for @xmath84 and @xmath85 as a function of the position @xmath86 .",
    "as it can be emphasized from equation ( [ eqaxi ] ) , the bigger @xmath3 , the larger is the core of the vortex , and the higher is the density level outside the vortex core . indeed , equation ( [ eqaxi ] ) for @xmath87 implies that the solution @xmath71 behaves like @xmath88 near the center .",
    "figure ( [ axivort ] b ) ) represents also the @xmath89 solution for @xmath29 varying between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the vortex core is shrinking as @xmath29 increases in agreement with the evolution of the condensate healing length ( @xmath92 ) , so does the wall boundary layer .",
    "a)=8truecm b)=8truecm    figure ( [ energy ] ) shows the free energy of the giant vortices at @xmath39 as a function of @xmath3 for different values of @xmath29 .",
    "the energy is found convex with @xmath3 for each curve . from this curve",
    "we can determine for each @xmath30 which @xmath3-vortex minimizes the free energy .",
    "it defines an increasing set of critical frequencies @xmath93 such that the @xmath3-vortex is the one with the lowest energy for @xmath94 with    @xmath95    = 12truecm    a @xmath3-vortex is stable when it is a local minimum of the free energy ( [ fener ] ) .",
    "we expect from the numerics that such a vortex is unstable at low enough frequency @xmath30 : it decomposes itself into @xmath3 single vortices ( see figures ( [ quar0 ] ) and ( [ snap0 ] ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "high frequencies destabilize the @xmath3-vortex by nucleating new vortices which gather into a new giant vortex as observed for @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the @xmath3-vortex can only be stable in a finite range of frequency and depending on the vaues of @xmath3 and @xmath29 , we may observe that the @xmath3-vortex can never be stabilized ( it is the case for @xmath97 , @xmath96 ) .",
    "the stability analysis is performed by an expansion of the free energy around the @xmath3-vortex solution .",
    "we write the perturbed wave - function of the giant vortex for @xmath98 in the form : @xmath99    following the periodic dependance in @xmath12 , we decompose the perturbation @xmath100 among azimuthal modes as a fourier set @xmath101 the complex functions @xmath102 describe the @xmath103 pertubation mode of the @xmath3 vortex and are normalized to unity .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath104 of the @xmath103 perturbation modes are complex numbers .",
    "we can omitt the @xmath3 perturbation mode which will bring nothing to the stability analysis since @xmath105 is already the minimizer of the axisymmetrical free energy with charge @xmath3 . by analysing the perturbed wavefunction near @xmath106",
    ", we observe that for @xmath107 the perturbation mode describes the destabilization of the @xmath3 vortex into a @xmath103-vortex in the center surrounded by @xmath108 single vortices . on the other hand , for @xmath109",
    "the perturbation describes the nucleation from the wall of @xmath110 isolated vortices .",
    "we obtain for the perturbed wavefunction : @xmath111    the free energy correction @xmath112 writes at the first non - zero order in the @xmath113 s :    @xmath114    omitting the @xmath3 superscript from now on .",
    "the set of operators @xmath115 follows :    @xmath116    with the diagonal terms :    @xmath117    we notice here that the @xmath12 dependance of the free energy has been integrated so that further calculations will only concern the @xmath86 spatial variations .",
    "this axisymetrical simplification leads eventually to a one dimensional stability problem .",
    "the stability of the @xmath3-giant follows from the perturbated energy structure : if the operators @xmath115 are all found positive then the vortex is stable . on the other hand ,",
    "if at least one of these operators is shown negative the giant vortex is unstable towards either decomposition into simpler vortices or nucleation / annihilation of vortices .",
    "the operators @xmath115 couple in fact the two modes @xmath118 and @xmath119 so that the determination of their full spectrum remains a complicate task .    however , if we could neglect the non - diagonal terms , the determination of the giant vortex stability would be straightforward . indeed , the stability would be only determined by the minimization of the effective free energies @xmath120 associated to the functions @xmath121 for each @xmath122 . following this assumption discussed in more details below , we only have to determine the eigenfunction @xmath123 which minimizes the corresponding energy :    @xmath124    with the following conditions ( omitting the hat of the functions @xmath123 later on ) :    @xmath125    we observe that energy ( [ pener ] ) is unchanged through the symetry @xmath126 so that we just need to calculate the minimizer for @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath121 corresponds in fact to the calculation of a @xmath103 giant vortex placed into the effective potential :    @xmath128    the solution can be reached again through a dissipative dynamics :    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is introduced here as the lagrangian multiplier for the unity norm constraint .",
    "figure ( [ profgq ] ) shows precisely different @xmath121 for @xmath97 and @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath3 giant vortex profile is also indicated . as suggested by the effective potential ,",
    "the perturbations modes are concentrated near the center of the trap for @xmath107 where the giant vortex density is very small .",
    "for @xmath109 the density @xmath121 is concentrated near the wall since the centrifugal term of the perturbation dominates the @xmath3-vortex influence . moreover , this figure is in agreement with our assumption of weak off - diagonal terms made above .",
    "indeed , for @xmath132 the interaction term @xmath133 is very small since one of the solution is concentrated near @xmath134 while the other one is only present near @xmath135 .",
    "however , for @xmath136 the situation can not be concluded easily since both term is concentrated near @xmath135 .",
    "= 8truecm    by minimizing the energy @xmath137 ( [ pener ] ) , we can determine whether the functionnal @xmath138 ( [ diag ] ) is positive definite for all type of perturbations as function of the frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the sign of this free energy for the @xmath103-perturbation changes for :    @xmath139    it tells us that for @xmath107 the @xmath103 perturbation mode is stable for @xmath140 while for @xmath109 it is stable only for @xmath141 .",
    "the change of inequality is due to the change of sign of @xmath108 .",
    "we define then two critical curves @xmath142 and @xmath143 calculated both for @xmath144 . for a given @xmath30 , if one can find a @xmath103 such that @xmath145 then the @xmath3-vortex can not exist since it decomposes into more complex vortices configuration . on the other hand if one can find a @xmath103 such that @xmath146 , the @xmath3 vortex is also unstable and new vortices enter in the cloud .",
    "thus the @xmath3-vortex can only be observed if @xmath147 and in the range @xmath148 the @xmath3-vortex is linearly stable .",
    "figures ( [ omeg300 ] ) a ) and b ) show @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath131 , @xmath97 and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "a)=8truecm b)=8truecm    this figure is found in relatively good agreement with the full numerical simulations of the dynamics shown figure ( [ snap0 ] ) .",
    "we remark on figure ( [ omeg300 ] ) that the @xmath57-vortex can not be stabilized since the perturbation mode @xmath152 is still unstable when the high vortices perturbation @xmath153 becomes unstable ( at @xmath154 ) as observed on figure ( [ snap0 ] ) .",
    "the solution with four single vortices becomes unstable at @xmath46 which is close to the value found for the @xmath57-vortex .",
    "for @xmath151 .....    figure ( [ omlh300 ] ) presents the evolution of @xmath155 for @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "as observed above , it shows that for @xmath157 no giant vortex can be observed while for @xmath158 giant vortices of charge @xmath159 can be observed in a given range of @xmath30 .",
    "= 8truecm    defining @xmath160 ( respectively @xmath161 ) as the lowest frequency ( vortex charge ) at which a giant vortex can be observed for a strength @xmath29 , we determine in the @xmath30-@xmath29 plane ( or @xmath3-@xmath29 plane similarly ) the region where the solution consist in stable giant vortices only .",
    "the curves @xmath160 and @xmath161 delimiting these regions are shown on figure ( [ omgiant ] ) .",
    "we have shown numerically that giant vortex solutions can exist in axisymmetrical 2-d bec model for trap potentials steeper than harmonic .",
    "we have investigated in more details the linear stability of these vortices for the cylindrical wall - like potential .",
    "the axisymmetry property of the @xmath3-vortices simplifies the stability procedure into a one dimensional minimization problem . under a no off - diagonal terms assumption presenting good agreement with the full numerical studies we can determine the regions where the giant vortices are stable .",
    "finally a master curve presenting the frequency and vortex charge above which giant vortices are stable for varying nonlinear strength @xmath29 is presented .",
    "these results have been obtained for the particular case of cylindrical wall potential but can be adapted to smooth bec potentials .",
    "the stability analysis lead to the same minimization problem but the numerical determination of the @xmath103 modes needs more careful investigations since they are not concentrated on @xmath162 disk .",
    "it is my pleasure to thank vincent hakim for his encouraging remarks on this work .",
    "i also would like thank warmly the editors for organising this special issue .",
