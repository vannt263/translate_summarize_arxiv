    "the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration at high baryon density is of fundamental importance for the understanding of qcd  @xcite , but a clear experimental evidence has not been achieved , so far .",

    "on the other hand , dileptons are particularly well suited for an investigation of the early phases of high - energy heavy - ion collisions because they can leave the reaction volume essentially undistorted by final - state interactions .",
    "indeed , dileptons from heavy - ion collisions have been measured by the dls collaboration at the bevalac  @xcite and by the ceres  @xcite , helios  @xcite , na38  @xcite and na50 collaborations  @xcite at sps energies .",
    "the recent data on @xmath0 or @xmath1 spectra at sps energies might provide valuable insight ; li et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the enhancement of @xmath0 pairs in s  +  au collisions as observed by the ceres collaboration  @xcite stems from an enhanced @xmath2-meson production ( via @xmath7 annihilation ) due to a dropping @xmath2-mass in the medium .",
    "in fact , their analysis  which is based on an expanding fireball scenario  is supported by the microscopic transport calculations in ref .  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile various authors have substantiated the observation of refs .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _  that the spectral shape of the dilepton yield is incompatible with free meson form factors  @xcite . however , a more conventional approach including the change of the @xmath2-meson spectral function in the medium due to the coupling of @xmath8 and nucleon dynamics along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite was found to be ( roughly ) compatible with the ceres data @xcite , as well , whereas the dimuon data of the helios-3 collaboration  @xcite could only be described satisfactorily when including dropping meson masses  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , our knowledge on the @xmath2 spectral function has improved since  as first pointed out by friman and pirner  @xcite - resonant @xmath2-@xmath9 interactions in p - wave scattering significantly enhance the strength in the vector - isovector channel at low invariant mass .",
    "in fact , the ceres data for s  +  au at 200  a  gev and pb  +  au at 160  a  gev , using an expanding fireball model , were found to be compatible within such a hadronic scenario  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we report on novel developments in this direction by improving on both the reaction dynamics and the @xmath2 spectral function ( _ e.g. _  by constraints from @xmath10 data ) , which will be discussed in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .",
    "3 the resulting dilepton spectra are then compared to the data from both ceres and helios-3 collaborations simultaneously ; we also search for observables that might distinguish between the hadronic and dropping mass scenario , in particular dilepton @xmath4-spectra and inclusive yields _ above _ the @xmath2 mass .",
    "we finish with a summary and concluding remarks in sect .  4 .",
    "the dynamical description of proton - nucleus or nucleus - nucleus collisions is performed within the covariant transport approach hsd  @xcite which has been found to account for hadronic data from sis to sps energies reasonably well and has recently been used in the analysis of dilepton data  @xcite .",
    "the dilepton production is calculated perturbatively by including the contributions from the dalitz - decays @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the direct dilepton decays of the vector mesons @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the @xmath2 and the @xmath15 meson may as well be produced in @xmath7 and @xmath16 or @xmath17 collisions , respectively . for a detailed description of all these processes",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "we note that we discard baryon - baryon ( @xmath18 ) , meson - baryon ( @xmath19 ) and meson - meson ( @xmath20 ) bremsstrahlung channels as well as the dalitz decays of the baryon resonances in order to avoid double counting when employing the full @xmath2 spectral function .",
    "the dilepton radiation from @xmath2 mesons is calculated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath2-meson propagator in the hadronic medium , depending on the baryon density @xmath23 and temperature @xmath24 as well as on energy @xmath25 and 3-momentum @xmath26 in the local rest frame of the baryon current ( comoving frame ) .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath27 is related to the @xmath2-meson 4-momentum in the nuclear medium as @xmath28 while @xmath29 is spin averaged over the longitudinal and transverse part of the @xmath2-propagator : @xmath30 the @xmath2-meson selfenergy @xmath31 is obtained by combining the effects of the different hadronic interactions as : @xmath32 @xmath33 the explicit evaluation of the various selfenergy components is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "we here employ an improved version in the following respects :    * in addition to p - wave @xmath34 interactions ( @xmath35=@xmath9 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) we also account for s - wave excitations into @xmath39 and @xmath40 resonances ( as usual , the corresponding coupling constants are estimated from the @xmath2@xmath9 partial decay width ) ; * the coupling of the resonances to virtual photons is calculated within the improved vector dominance model of kroll , lee and zumino  @xcite to avoid overestimates of the @xmath41 branching ratios ; * the medium modifications of the two - pion selfenergy @xmath42 are extended to arbitrary 3-momentum within the recently developed model of urban _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the combined @xmath2-meson selfenergy is then further constrained by experimental information on @xmath10 and @xmath43 absorption cross sections  @xcite which correspond to the limit @xmath44 .",
    "the constraints by photo - production data have been stressed by several authors @xcite and thus qualify as stringent benchmarks for the @xmath2 spectral function .",
    "we note that by resummation of hadronic interactions in the @xmath2-meson selfenergy @xmath45 ( eqs .",
    "( [ long]),([trans ] ) ) we incorporate dynamical effects which are not only linear in the baryon density @xmath23 , but also of higher order .",
    "the resummation of interactions at fixed baryon density and temperature involves the assumption that all interaction terms add coherently  an assumption that might become questionable due to the short time scales of a few fm / c in heavy - ion collisions at sps energies @xcite .",
    "our approach thus differs conceptually from the analysis performed in refs .",
    "@xcite where only dilepton rates linear in @xmath23 have been considered and higher order coherent effects have been discarded .    as an example  relevant for the heavy - ion reactions at sps energies  we show in fig .",
    "1 the spin averaged @xmath46 as a function of the invariant mass @xmath27 and the 3-momentum @xmath47 for a temperature of 150 mev at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . with increasing baryon density we find the @xmath2 spectral function to increase substantially in width showing only minor structures at high density .",
    "thus the lifetime of the @xmath2-meson in the nuclear medium becomes very short due to well established hadronic interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "its average propagation in space is limited to distances less than 0.5  fm already at normal nuclear matter density ( even for high momenta ) .",
    "the cross section for the pion annihilation channel @xmath50 is taken in line with ref .  @xcite as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is",
    "the pion 3-momentum in the center - of - mass frame and @xmath53 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the @xmath54 coupling constant and bare @xmath2 mass are fixed to reproduce the pion electromagnetic form factor in free space  @xcite .    in this way",
    "we ensure that the fourier transformation of the isovector current - current correlation function in vacuum is consistent with the experimental information in terms of the vacuum @xmath2 spectral function @xcite .",
    "we note that constraints from chiral symmetry are not fully accounted for in our model for the spectral function since the @xmath55 meson is not treated as the chiral partner of the @xmath2 meson  @xcite .",
    "however , the dominant effects arise from p - wave @xmath56- and resonant @xmath57 scattering , where chiral symmetry does not play a dominant role .",
    "our dynamical calculations are carried out as follows : the time - evolution of the proton - nucleus or nucleus - nucleus collision is described within the covariant transport approach hsd  @xcite without dropping vector meson masses . whenever a @xmath2-meson is produced in the course of the hadronic cascade ( by baryon - baryon , meson - baryon or pion - pion collisions ) , its 4-momentum in the local rest frame of the baryon current",
    "is recorded together with the information on the local baryon density , the local transverse temperature and its production source .",
    "we note that the definition of a local temperature is model dependent ; here we have used a logarithmic fit to the transverse @xmath58 spectra of mesons at midrapidity . without going into a detailed discussion of this issue",
    "we note that our results for dilepton spectra do not change within the numerical accuracy when using a constant temperature @xmath59  mev at sps energies since @xmath60 depends rather weakly on @xmath24 ( at a given nucleon density ) .",
    "we begin our discussion of the dilepton spectra at sps energies with the p  +  w system at 200  gev incident energy . fig .",
    "2 shows the spectral channel decomposition as a function of the @xmath61 invariant mass @xmath27 in comparison to the data of the helios-3 collaboration  @xcite including the experimental cuts in transverse mass and rapidity as well as the experimental mass resolution as in ref .",
    "the spectrum is normalized to the charged particle multiplicity @xmath62 in the pseudorapidity bin 3.7 @xmath63 5.2 . the upper part of fig .",
    "2 shows the dimuon spectra when employing the free @xmath2 spectral function whereas the lower part displays our results when accounting for the full medium modifications of the @xmath2-meson propagator . as is apparent from fig .  2 ,",
    "the spectrum for p  +  w can be fully accounted for by the electromagnetic decays of the @xmath64 and vector mesons @xmath65 and @xmath15 ; contributions from meson - meson channels ( @xmath66 ) are of minor importance here .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath2-meson essentially hadronizes in the vacuum , there is no noticeable difference between the summed spectra in the upper and lower part of fig .  2 .",
    "the situation changes appreciably when turning to nucleus - nucleus collisions . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the results of our calculation for the differential dilepton spectra for s  +  w at 200  a@xmath67gev with the experimental data  @xcite employing the same cuts and mass resolution as before .",
    "again , the upper part shows our results for the free @xmath2 spectral function whereas the lower part represents our results including the full medium modifications of the @xmath2 propagator . even at forward rapidities",
    "as measured in central s  +  w ( 200  a@xmath67gev ) a sizable contribution for invariant masses 0.3  gev @xmath68 @xmath69 0.7  gev stems from the @xmath70 channel .",
    "also in the @xmath15 mass regime around 1  gev there is a significant contribution from @xmath71 and @xmath17 annihilation to dimuons which explains the enhanced @xmath72 ratio in s  +  w relative to p  +  w. as has been found earlier  @xcite the experimental spectrum can not be properly described in terms of a free @xmath2 spectral function : there is an excess for invariant masses @xmath73  0.8  gev and insufficient yield around @xmath73  0.5  gev . the description of the data is significantly improved when including the hadronic medium modifications of the @xmath2 propagator ( lower part of fig .",
    "3 )  quite analogous to the dropping mass scenario  @xcite when employing a @xmath2-mass shift according to hatsuda and lee  @xcite .",
    "however , there persists a significant difference : whereas in the dropping mass scenario ( cf .  fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) the dimuon yield is underestimated for @xmath74 1.2 gev the in - medium @xmath2 spectral function seems to give sufficient pairs in this region due to its substantial broadening in dense matter ( cf . fig .  1 ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we also compare the results of our calculation for the differential dilepton spectra in pb  +  au at 160  a@xmath67gev and @xmath75  fm with preliminary experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 acceptance cuts in pseudorapidity ( @xmath76 ) , transverse momentum ( @xmath77  gev / c ) as well as in the opening angle of the @xmath0 pair ( @xmath78  mrad ) are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the experimental mass resolution has been included in evaluating the final mass spectrum , which is normalized to the number of charged particles @xmath79 in the pseudorapidity bin 2.1 @xmath80 3.1 .",
    "again , the upper part shows our results for the free @xmath2 spectral function whereas the lower part represents our results including the full medium modifications . for pb",
    "+  au at 160  a@xmath67gev ( and semi central collisions ) the dominant yield for invariant masses",
    "@xmath81 0.7  gev stems from @xmath7 annihilation . in the @xmath15 mass regime around 1",
    "gev there is again a large contribution from @xmath71 and @xmath17 annihilation to dileptons . within the present statistics ,",
    "however , there is no unique signal for in - medium effects since the calculation with the free spectral function ( upper part ) also describes the data except for one point at 0.7  gev ( cf .  also ref .",
    "the calculation with the full spectral function describes the data somewhat better to the same accuracy as within the dropping mass scenario  @xcite .",
    "we note that the comparison with the data in fig .  4 has been performed for impact parameter @xmath82  fm , for which our transport model gives a charged particle multiplicity @xmath83 260 in accordance with the experimental normalization .    since the present dilepton invariant mass spectra do not discriminate the different models we also explore if the momentum distributions of the lepton pairs give some further insight ( as suggested by friman and pirner  @xcite and in ref .",
    "our calculated transverse momentum spectra  integrated over rapidity and the invariant mass range @xmath84  gev  are shown in fig .  5 for pb  +  au at 160  a@xmath67gev and @xmath85  fm using @xmath4-bins of 50  mev / c . the dashed line in fig .",
    "5 displays the result with the free spectral function while the solid line shows the result for the in - medium spectral function .",
    "apart from an overall increase of the spectrum we do _ not _ observe significant changes of the slope in @xmath4  as was the case for the dropping mass scenario ( cf .",
    "13 of ref .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 spectra do not qualify in disentangling the different schemes either .",
    "another signature studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and also suggested in @xcite is related to the total dilepton yield between the free @xmath86 and @xmath15 peaks where the dominant contribution stems from @xmath2 decays . in this regime",
    "the dropping mass scenario leads to a _ reduction _ by about a factor 2 - 3 as compared to a free @xmath2 spectral function for pb  +  pb at 160  a@xmath67gev  @xcite , while a broadening of the @xmath2 spectral function due to hadronic interactions shows an _ enhancement_. this feature is demonstrated quantitatively in fig .",
    "6 for pb  +  au at @xmath87=5  fm for the different scenarios employing an experimental mass resolution of @xmath88=10  mev .",
    "we find a difference by about a factor of 5 between the dropping mass scenario ( dashed line ) and the hadronic spectral function approach ( solid line ) which might be accessible experimentally with the ceres detector at improved mass resolution .",
    "we note , furthermore , that in the spectral function approach the relative enhancement is most pronounced at @xmath89  gev while in the dropping mass scheme we find a maximum enhancement at @xmath90  gev for this system .",
    "on the basis of the covariant transport approach hsd  @xcite we have studied dilepton production in proton and heavy - ion induced reactions at sps energies .",
    "various contributions are accounted for : the dalitz - decays of @xmath91 mesons , the direct dilepton decays of the vector mesons @xmath14 and @xmath15 as well as @xmath71 and @xmath17 channels .",
    "it is found that for p  +  w collisions at 200  gev the mesonic decays almost completely determine the dilepton yield , whereas in s  +  w and pb  +  au reactions the @xmath92 , @xmath93 annihilation channels and @xmath17 collisions contribute substantially .",
    "the experimental data taken by the helios-3 @xcite and ceres collaborations  @xcite are in general underestimated by the calculations for invariant masses 0.35  gev  @xmath94  gev when using a free @xmath2 spectral function ( in accordance with refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that both the dropping mass scenario  using either brown / rho scaling @xcite or dropping vector meson masses according to qcd sum rule studies @xcite  as well as the hadronic spectral function approach  @xcite lead to dilepton spectra that are in good agreement with the experimental data for all systems at sps energies ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to discriminate between the different models we have investigated dilepton transverse momentum distributions for invariant masses",
    "@xmath95  gev in pb  +  au collisions ; unfortunately , only little differences have been found as compared to the dropping mass scenario  @xcite . however , the in - medium broadening of the @xmath2 spectral function results in a much higher dilepton rate than the dropping mass scenario _ above _ the @xmath86-mass",
    ". therefore one might experimentally distinguish the two different scenarios by the total dilepton yield in the invariant mass range @xmath96  gev in pb  +  au collisions ( cf .",
