    "gutzwiller s trace formula , established in the late 1960s and early 1970s states that it is possible to obtain the level density of a bounded hamiltonian dynamical system with semiclassical accuracy , based entirely on the information provided by its classical periodic orbits @xcite . according to gutzwiller the density of energy states can be written as a sum over prime periodic orbits and their repetitions , @xmath0 } , \\label{a2}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the average density of states , @xmath2 is the classical action of the prime periodic orbit @xmath3 , @xmath4 is its period and @xmath5 is its maslov phase .",
    "gutzwiller derived the pre - exponential factors @xmath6 in semiclassical approximation , expressing them in terms of the stability properties of the corresponding periodic orbits .",
    "the orbits used to construct the sum ( [ a2 ] ) are obtained at a given value of the energy @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    "it is known that as the energy of a generic , nonhyperbolic system changes , the structure of the phase space changes and with it the set of periodic orbits .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` phase - space metamorphosis '' @xcite .",
    "phase - space metamorphosis , in general , is accompanied by the creation and destruction of periodic orbits giving rise to the interesting phenomenon of ghost orbits @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , the sum in ( [ a2 ] ) will change as a function of @xmath7 in the sense that it may acquire or lose certain terms .",
    "however , apart from hyperbolic systems@xcite , there exists an interesting class of systems , which are free of such metamorphoses of the phase space .",
    "these are the scaling systems , for which the action functional @xmath8 for any periodic orbit @xmath3 decouples into the product of an energy - dependent part @xmath9 and the `` reduced action '' @xmath10 , which depends only on the geometry of the periodic orbit , @xmath11 examples of such systems are various billiard systems , and also ( with suitable definitions of scaling parameters ) the hydrogen atom in strong electric and/or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for such systems neither the geometry of the phase space nor the geometry of the set of periodic orbits change with energy",
    ". therefore the structure of the sum ( [ a2 ] ) can be defined once and is valid for all values of @xmath7 . in such cases",
    "it is interesting to investigate the relationship between the fixed set of periodic orbits ( the periodic orbit spectrum ) and the quantum energy spectrum .",
    "direct derivation of gutzwiller s trace formula , as presented originally by gutzwiller , is based on the saddle point approximation .",
    "this implies that this formula is meant to work only semiclassically , i.e. to predict only the highly excited energy levels with semiclassical accuracy .",
    "indeed , for generic billiard domains , gutzwiller s formula is not exact @xcite .",
    "however , in certain special cases ( [ a2 ] ) is known to predict the entire energy spectrum exactly .",
    "an example is the harmonic oscillator .",
    "moreover , exact `` gutzwiller - like '' trace formulae do exist . a theorem by anderson and melrose @xcite states that for any billiard there exists a set of pre - exponential factors @xmath12 , which makes the relationship ( [ a2 ] ) exact .",
    "other exact gutzwiller - like trace formulae are obtained in the context of quantum graph theory@xcite .",
    "we show that ray - splitting systems @xcite provide further examples of exact gutzwiller - like trace formulae .",
    "a specific example , a scaling one - dimensional step billiard , closely related to quantum graphs , is presented in the following section together with its generalized ray - splitting gutzwiller formula . in section",
    "iii we present a proof for the exactness of the ray - splitting gutzwiller formula . in section",
    "iv we define the ray - splitting zeta function and relate it to cycle expansion techniques . in section v we make use of the exactness of the ray - splitting gutzwiller formula to prove a nontrivial combinatorial identity . in section",
    "vi we discuss our results and conclude the paper .",
    "in this section we study the spectrum and the generalized ray - splitting gutzwiller formula for the one - dimensional scaling step billiard@xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scaling constant and @xmath7 is the energy of the system . in this paper",
    "we focus on the case @xmath15 .",
    "first results on this model were presented in @xcite in the context of generalized poisson formulae in ray - splitting systems . despite its formal simplicity ( [ a4 ] ) can be used to illustrate many physical and mathematical methods and ideas connected with the ray - splitting approach@xcite .",
    "we work in units such that @xmath16 , the width of the potential well is 1 and the mass of the quantum particle is 1/2 . defining @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 it is elementary to obtain the exact quantum mechanical equation @xmath20 + { \\kappa\\over k}\\sin(kb)\\cos [ \\kappa(1-b ) ] = 0 \\label{z1}\\ ] ] for the energy levels @xmath21 of the system .",
    "they are determined by the roots @xmath22 of ( [ z1 ] ) according to @xmath23 .",
    "it is more convenient to write ( [ z1 ] ) in the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 and the reflection coefficient @xmath26 in general the two frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ( [ a6 ] ) are not rationally related . therefore ( [ a6 ] ) connects the physical problem of a scaling step potential with the mathematical theory of almost periodic functions@xcite .",
    "this means that all our exact results on the spectrum of the scaling step potential ( [ a4 ] ) can be interpreted as theorems on the roots of doubly periodic functions .    solving ( [ a6 ] ) numerically , it is easy to obtain a large number of roots for studying statistical properties of the quantum energy levels as well as the relationships to the classical periodic orbits of the system .",
    "the latter goal is achieved by computing the fourier image of the density of states defined as @xmath29 according to the gutzwiller trace formula ( [ a2 ] ) , the fourier transform provides a convenient tool for studying the orbit spectra of dynamical systems , since it produces pronounced peaks at those values of @xmath30 that correspond to the actions of classical periodic orbits . in the case of the scaling system ( [ a4 ] ) , the actions @xmath2 in ( [ a2 ] ) are proportional to @xmath31 , @xmath32 and hence one expects the fourier transform ( [ a7 ] ) of ( [ a2 ] ) to produce a @xmath33-peak at @xmath34 for every primitive periodic orbit @xmath3 and its repetitions @xmath35 .    the result of the numerical evaluation of the sum ( [ a7 ] ) for this system is presented in fig .",
    "2 . it shows a large number of narrow peaks .",
    "most of them do not correspond to the standard ( newtonian ) periodic orbits .",
    "this is immediately clear since in the case of the potential ( [ a4 ] ) there exists only a single primitive newtonian periodic orbit at any value of the energy above the potential step ( see fig .  1 ) .    the extra peaks in fig",
    "2 are due to non - newtonian periodic orbits@xcite .",
    "they correspond to the non - newtonian reflections off the sharp ray - splitting step .",
    "together with the newtonian orbits the non - newtonian orbits account for every single peak in fig .  2 for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath36 .",
    "numerical computations indicate that the maxima of @xmath37 converge to @xmath33-peaks in the limit when the number of roots included in the sum ( [ a7 ] ) tends to infinity .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that there exists an exact formula of the type ( [ a2 ] ) . that this is indeed the case",
    "is proved in sect .",
    "iii below .    a natural generalization of gutzwiller s trace formula , which includes the contributions from the non - newtonian ray - splitting orbits ,",
    "was obtained previously in @xcite .",
    "speaking in terms of the step - potential ( [ a4 ] ) , instead of just a single orbit bouncing between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , a generic orbit may now be reflected off or transmitted through the ray - splitting boundary at @xmath40 any number of times in arbitrary sequence . as a result , the set of _ primitive non - newtonian orbits _ becomes infinite .",
    "in a one - dimensional system the numbers of these reflections and transmissions are the only characteristics of the orbits , and therefore any orbit can be characterized uniquely and completely by a binary sequence of symbols @xmath41 and @xmath42 that keep track of each reflection off the left ( @xmath41 ) or the right ( @xmath42 ) wall of the potential well .",
    "the corresponding generalized gutzwiller sum includes all primitive newtonian and non - newtonian periodic orbits and their repetitions , @xmath43^ { \\nu } \\ , e^{i\\nu s_{p } } , \\label{a9}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the average level density , @xmath45 , defined by ( [ reflco ] ) , is the quantum reflection coefficient , @xmath46 is the transmission coefficient , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the number of reflections and transmissions of the primitive orbit @xmath3 at the potential step , and @xmath49 counts the total number of times the orbit reflects off the walls and off the potential step to the right of the ray - splitting boundary .",
    "note that @xmath50 and explicitly defines the maslov phase in ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "if we denote the actions of the shortest orbits ( @xmath42 and @xmath41 ) by @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , the action @xmath2 of any orbit can be expressed as a sum @xmath53 for certain integers @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( generally different from @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . the level density ( [ a9 ] )",
    "contains only even powers of the transmission coefficient @xmath58 , because every periodic orbit transmits an even number of times through the ray - splitting boundary .",
    "using quantum graph theory @xcite , it is possible to show that the expression ( [ a9 ] ) is exact .",
    "we prove this below after presenting some basic ideas of quantum graph theory .",
    "> from the perspective of quantum graph theory , the quantization of a particle in the potential ( [ a4 ] ) is treated as a scattering problem on the graph @xmath59 with three vertices and two bonds described by the connectivity matrix @xcite @xmath60 on every bond connecting vertices @xmath61 and @xmath62 , one defines a free particle wave function @xmath63 , which satisfies the following vertex conditions : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the coordinate along a particular bond of length @xmath66 , so that the wave functions on different bonds match on every vertex .",
    "the general solution satisfying the vertex conditions is @xmath67}\\sin [ k\\beta _ { ij}\\left ( l_{ij}-\\xi\\right ) ] + \\frac{\\varphi _ { j}c_{ij}}{\\sin [ k\\beta_{ij}l_{ij}]}\\sin [ k \\beta_{ij}\\xi].\\ ] ] the presence of the coefficients @xmath68 allows us to generalize the formalism developed in @xcite . for the derivatives we have the continuity conditions @xmath69 for the case of the potential ( [ a4 ] ) , @xmath70 @xmath71 } \\sin [ k\\beta \\left ( 1-b-\\xi\\right ) ] .\\ ] ] the matching and continuity conditions at vertex 2 result in @xmath72=0\\ ] ] or @xmath73-r\\sin[k(l_{1}-l_{2})]=0 , \\label{transc}\\ ] ] which is the same as ( [ a6 ] ) .",
    "the lengths @xmath74 and @xmath75 , defined in ( [ ll ] ) turn out to be the weighted bond lengths",
    ".    the same quantization condition can be obtained from considering the scattering process at every vertex of the graph ( [ a10 ] ) .",
    "the vertex scattering matrix is given by @xmath76 where the index @xmath61 refers to the vertex under consideration , @xmath77 are coefficients that depend on the physics of the scattering at the vertex @xmath61 and @xmath78 are the matrix elements of the connectivity matrix determining the geometry of the graph .",
    "at the `` dead end '' vertices 1 and 3 of the graph ( [ a10 ] ) we have @xmath79 . for the central vertex",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath80 the graph scattering matrix , describing the graph as a whole , is given by @xmath81 where the matrix @xmath82 accounts for the phases accumulated along the bonds .",
    "the quantization condition@xcite , @xmath83 results in @xmath84 this is the same as ( [ transc ] ) .    with the help of @xmath85 the quantization condition ( [ quaco ] ) can be written alternatively as a sum over the periodic orbits of the graph .",
    "indeed , since the scattering matrix is defined geometrically using the graph connectivity matrix , its indices correspond to the vertices @xmath61 and @xmath62 connected by a bond if the matrix element @xmath86 .",
    "the trace of the @xmath87-th power of this matrix is defined on the set of all the possible cyclical @xmath87-bond sequences . using ( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) we obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 give the number of times the left ( @xmath41 ) and the right ( @xmath42 ) bonds of ( [ a10 ] ) occur in the sequence , @xmath90",
    ", @xmath56 is the number of reflections from the middle vertex and @xmath91 is the number of transmissions through it . since the reflection coefficient coming from the scattering matrix ( [ sigma ] )",
    "can be positive or negative , the factor @xmath92 is needed to keep track of how many times it appears with a minus sign .",
    "it also keeps track of how many times a given orbit scatters off the walls .",
    "there are two possibilities for @xmath93 .",
    "either it corresponds to a prime periodic orbit , or it corresponds to a bond sequence that retraces itself @xmath35 times . in this case",
    "@xmath94 is @xmath35 times the length of a single ( primitive ) traversal @xmath95 , and the pre - exponential factor is the @xmath35-th power of the factor corresponding to the shortest closed bond sequence . alternatively",
    ", these closed bond sequences can be viewed as periodic orbits traced by a particle moving on the graph .    on the other hand , from the analytical properties of @xmath96 $ ] @xcite , it is easy to relate it to the spectral counting function @xmath97 , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the average spectral staircase function ( the weyl term ) .",
    "putting all these ingredients together , one arrives at the trace formula ( [ a9 ] ) .",
    "the exactness of ( [ a9 ] ) can be understood on the basis of the dramatic increase of the number of the primitive non - newtonian orbits included in ( [ a9 ] ) .",
    "as the orbit length @xmath95 in ( [ a9 ] ) increases , non - newtonian orbits proliferate exponentially , providing additional information about the structure of the potential @xmath100 .",
    "it is interesting to compare ( [ a9 ] ) with the results produced by gutzwiller s trace formula without ray splitting . for the step potential ( [ a4 ] ) there exits only one newtonian periodic orbit with classical action @xmath101 which bounces between the left and the right walls of the well ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore ( [ a9 ] ) predicts @xmath102 where @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "since only a single periodic orbit contributes , ( [ a15a ] ) predicts a periodic spectrum for a particle in the step potential ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the fourier image @xmath106 ^ 2\\ ,   \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\delta \\left[m s^{0}_{n}-s\\right]\\ ] ] of the density of states produces @xmath33-peaks at integer multiples of the reduced action @xmath107 of the ( only ) newtonian orbit of the system .",
    "figure 3 shows that the exact spectrum of the problem is not periodic , which illustrates that the trace formula ( [ a2 ] ) ( ( [ a9 ] ) , respectively ) without non - newtonian orbits predicts a wrong energy level distribution .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the ideas and procedures discussed above provides a proof of the exactness of ( [ a9 ] ) for the whole class of @xmath108-step scaled potentials @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the scaling coefficient for the @xmath61-th interval @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "despite its exponentially decreasing terms , ( [ a9 ] ) converges only conditionally due to the exponential proliferation of the non - newtonian orbits .",
    "therefore , one should specify a physically meaningful way of partial summation for this series . in practice",
    ", one could certainly consider the shortest periodic orbits in order to get an approximation for ( [ a9 ] ) .",
    "figure 3 presents the contribution of the 43 shortest periodic orbits .",
    "this corresponds to including all periodic orbits up to binary code length 7 ( e.g. @xmath114 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that the peaks give a very accurate representation of the actual positions of the roots .",
    "since ( [ a9 ] ) is a geometric series with respect to the repetition index @xmath35 , this part of the summation can be performed immediately , yielding @xmath115 using the relation ( [ period ] ) , the density of states can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 \\label{a17}\\ ] ] is an analog of the fredholm determinant associated with the ray - splitting system ( [ a4 ] ) and the sum ( [ a9 ] ) , considered as a function of the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath58 .",
    "one can consider a cycle expansion @xcite of the product ( [ a17 ] ) in powers of @xmath45 or @xmath58 .",
    "a natural choice for the expansion variable would be the smaller one of @xmath118 . physically , this asymmetry determines whether reflection or transmission is the dominant process .",
    "in quantum graph theory the representation of the quantum level density in the form of a gutzwiller - like trace formula is exact@xcite . in special cases",
    "both the level density and the trace formula can be evaluated analytically and give rise to combinatorial identities . this idea was successfully implemented by schanz and smilansky who obtained a host of new and nontrivial combinatorial identities @xcite .",
    "additional identities are generated whenever ( [ transc ] ) can be solved analytically .",
    "we illustrate the method by choosing @xmath119 such that @xmath120 and @xmath121 in ( [ transc ] ) . in this case",
    "( [ transc ] ) becomes @xmath122 , solved by @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding periodic level density can be obtained directly using the conventional poisson formula , @xmath124 it is interesting that the arguments of the exponents in ( [ rex ] ) coincide with the actions of the repetitions of the newtonian orbit , @xmath125 .",
    "this coincidence is due to the special choice of parameters , @xmath126 assumed in this case .    alternatively , the level density ( [ rex ] ) can be expressed via ( [ a9 ] ) . equating the pre - factors of terms with the same action results in the following sum rule @xmath127 ^{\\nu } .",

    "the sum rule ( [ sr ] ) can be recast into a combinatorial theorem on the set @xmath129 of cyclically non - equivalent binary codes of even length @xmath130 over the symbols @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the following way .",

    "( ii ) scan each word @xmath131 and assign @xmath136 according to the substitutions @xmath137 then , with @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 which is equivalent to the sum rule ( [ sr ] )",
    ". stated differently , ( [ cth ] ) is the same as @xmath140",
    "since atle selberg discovered his famous trace formula in 1947 @xcite , more exact trace formulae were found .",
    "there are many cases in which the geometrical information contained in the set of closed geodesics ( periodic orbits ) can be used to reconstruct the spectrum exactly .",
    "gutzwiller provided a physical theory which parallels these results .",
    "his formula points the way to establish _ approximate _ relationships , which involve physical rather than geometrical concepts .",
    "in particular , gutzwiller uses the semiclassical saddle - point approximation , valid under certain physical conditions , in order to derive the pre - exponential factors in ( [ a2 ] ) in a form , which is valid for a wide class of dynamical systems .",
    "however , gutzwiller s theory does not imply that these sums are necessarily approximate .",
    "there exist different approaches to establish exact relationships between the spectra of operators and the spectra of periodic orbits .",
    "the above method , based on the intuitively clear idea of ray splitting , provides an example which is physical , lies outside of the scope of gutzwiller s approach , and is exact .",
    "this result immediately suggests many important applications .",
    "first , from the mathematical point of view , one can derive statements about the behavior of the zeros of a wide class of almost periodic functions .",
    "second , the exactness of ( [ a9 ] ) provides a convenient way to prove many combinatorial identities , expressible in terms of periodic orbits in ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "lastly , it provides a non - trivial way to obtain feynman s path integrals in a well - defined limit .",
    "it is a natural idea to approximate arbitrary one - dimensional potentials by a step - like profile such as ( [ genstep ] ) , for which ( [ a9 ] ) is exact .",
    "taking the limit in which the size of the steps tends to zero , one can approximate the shape of any smooth potential with any accuracy .",
    "as the number of steps increases , the sum over the non - newtonian orbits leads to feynman s path integral .                                                    *",
