    "the advance of experimental techniques on a nanometer scale has enhanced the interest on the electronic transport through quantum dots .",
    "especially interesting are the transport properties of a quantum dot ( qd ) under the influence of external time - dependent fields .",
    "the microwave fields applied to different parts of the system under consideration modify the qd charge and tunneling current .",
    "new effects have been observed and theoretically described , e.g. photon - assisted tunneling through small qd - s with well - resolved discrete energy states , photon - electron pumps and others @xcite .",
    "one can investigate the current flowing through a qd under periodic ( non - periodic ) modulation of the tunneling barriers or under harmonic modulation of the electron energy levels in both ( say , left and right ) electron reservoirs , e.g. @xcite .",
    "one of the important problem of mesoscopic physics is the interference of the charge carriers .",
    "this interference appears when two ( or more ) transmission channels for tunneling electron exist .",
    "the experimental situation in which the destructive interference may occur can be realized in the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) or in multi - terminal qd system .    in this paper",
    "we generalize models existing in the literature and consider the qd connected with three leads with additional over - dot ( bridge ) tunneling channel between leads , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to the possible stm experimental setup in which the qd placed between two leads - say the right leads , can be probed by means of the additional electrode ( tip ) - say the left lead . in such configuration",
    "the additional channels for the electron transfer between stm tip and the right and left leads exist .",
    "we consider the system driven out of the equilibrium by means of a dc voltage bias and time - dependent external fields . to treat this nonequilibrium , time - dependent electron transport process we use the evolution operator technique and find the final expression for the current flowing in the system in terms of the appropriate matrix elements of this operator .",
    "the hamiltonian of the qd coupled through the tunneling barriers @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath2 metal leads with chemical potential @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xmath6 within usually used notation .",
    "for simplicity the dot is characterized only by the single level @xmath7 and we have neglected the inta - dot electron - electron interaction .",
    "we assume the microwave fields applied to the leads and the qd as follows : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the charge localized on the qd and the current flowing in the system can be described in terms of the time - evolution operator @xmath10 , @xcite and , for example , the tunneling current flowing from the @xmath11-th lead can be obtained from the time derivative of the total number of electrons in this lead , @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath13\\,.\\ , \\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the matrix elements of @xmath10 calculated within the basis functions containing the single - particle functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 corresponding to the qd and @xmath11-th metal lead , respectively . @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 represent the initial filling of the corresponding single - particle states .",
    "assuming the wide - band limit and after lengthy calculations one obtains the average current leaving e.g. the left lead ( qd coupled with three leads @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) in the form :    @xmath22 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 here @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the coupling strength between qd and leads ( see the next section ) and @xmath27 denotes the bessel function .",
    "we consider the qd coupled with two and three metal leads with the additional over - dot ( bridge ) couplings between leads .",
    "the time - dependent currents are calculated in the case when the periodic rectangular - pulse external field is applied to each qd - lead barrier .",
    "in such a case we integrate numerically the corresponding set of the differential equations for the matrix elements of the evolution operator .",
    "we consider also the time - averaged values for currents and conductance in the case of harmonic modulation of the system parameters .",
    "we assume the temperature @xmath28  k and we take for @xmath29 the values comparable with @xmath30 .",
    "we estimated @xmath30 ( assuming its @xmath31-independence , @xmath32 ) using the relation @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the @xmath35-lead s bandwidth and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 was assumed ) . in our calculations we assumed @xmath39 ,",
    "all energies are given in @xmath26 units , time in @xmath40 units , the current , its derivatives and frequency are given in @xmath41 and @xmath42 units , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the currents for the qd coupled with three leads @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the additional couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the barriers qd-@xmath47 lead and qd-@xmath21 lead are changing in time according to a periodic rectangular - pulse external field with the period @xmath48 , which is applied to each barrier and these two fields are out of phase with a phase difference of @xmath49 .",
    "the third lead ( @xmath44 ) is connected with the qd through the time - independent barrier .",
    "we checked that the qd charge hardly depends on the additional @xmath50 couplings .",
    "although the qd charge is almost insensitive to the additional over - dot couplings the currents demonstrate such dependence .",
    "especially visible are the differences for the case when the chemical potential @xmath51 of the third electrode @xmath44 lies between chemical potentials of two other leads , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] b , e . for other values of @xmath51 ( relative to @xmath52 and @xmath53 )",
    "the influence of the over - dot tunneling channels considered here is smaller .",
    "note , that after the abrupt changing of the coupling strength the currents @xmath54 and @xmath55 are rapidly changed too , and after a short time reach the steady values .",
    "the qd coupled to three leads could be considered as the three - state system . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by changing the coupling strength the current changes its value from e.g. zero to the positive ( negative ) value or from the negative to the positive value and vice versa , depending on the chemical potentials of all leads .",
    "the additional couplings between leads modify the currents flowing in this system .    in the next step",
    "we show results for time - averaged current and its derivative with respect to @xmath7 , calculated as the functions of @xmath7 and @xmath51 , for the case of the qd coupled with two leads , fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , c and coupled with three leads , fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , d . in principle , inclusion of the third electrode does not introduce significant changes to the current @xmath56 , and only the dependence on the gate voltage is more `` diffusive '' .",
    "more transparent changes are visible on @xmath57 curves , calculated as functions of @xmath7 and @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , d ) .",
    "now , for the three - terminal qd system we observe three distinct enhancements regions going along @xmath7-axis at constant @xmath51 ( see , for example , the changes at @xmath58 ) whereas for the qd coupled with two electrodes we observe only one corresponding peak .",
    "more dramatic differences can be observed in the three - terminal qd system when we introduce changes for parameters of the one electrode , only . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show @xmath56 and @xmath59 for two different sets of parameters .",
    "the panels a and c correspond to the system in which one of the right lead is not affected by the time - dependent field , @xmath60 , whereas the panels b and d show results for the case @xmath61 .",
    "the results presented on the panels a and c are , in fact , very similar to the results obtained for two - terminal qd with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( not shown here ) .",
    "so , depending on the amplitude of oscillations of the microwave field applied to the additional third electrode , the resulting current flowing out of the left electrode can differ in magnitude and functional dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath65 from that ones for slightly different parameters of the third lead .    in summary , we considered the currents flowing in the system of the multiterminal qd using the evolution operator approach .",
    "the influence of the external harmonic microwave fields and rectangular - pulse modulations of the dot - lead barriers on the currents was investigated ."
