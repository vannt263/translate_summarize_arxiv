    "in general relativity , there were several definitions of multipoles proposed . since this theory is non - linear , it is , however , by no means obvious that this is at all possible .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that in early works multipoles were only defined in approximations to general relativity that lead to linear field equations and allow a classical treatment .",
    "the most definitions in this direction and beyond were covered in thorne s review @xcite .    from the 1960s on , new definitions in the full theory of isolated bodies . ]",
    "started emerging .",
    "these definitions of multipole moments can roughly be divided into two classes . in the first , the metric ( or quantities derived from it )",
    "are expanded at spacelike or null - like infinity .",
    "we will call these _ asymptotic definitions _ or _",
    "asymptotic multipole moments_. amongst these are the definitions of bondi , metzner , sachs and van der burgh ( bmsb ) @xcite , geroch and hansen ( gh ) @xcite , simon and beig ( sb ) @xcite , janis , newman and unti ( jnu ) @xcite , thorne @xcite , the adm approach @xcite and the komar integrals @xcite , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "there scope of applicability varies greatly .",
    "whereas the gh multipole moments are defined only in stationary spacetimes the bmsb , jnu , thorne and adm definitions hold in a more general setting .",
    "the komar expressions for the mass and the angular momentum on the other hand require stationarity and stationarity and axially symmetry , respectively .",
    "higher order multipoles are not defined in the komar approach . despite their conceptual differences , grsel showed in @xcite the equivalence of the gh and thorne s multipole moments in case",
    "the requirements of both definitions are met .",
    "additionally , the mass and the angular momentum in the gh , thorne , adm and komar approach can be shown to agree .    in the second class fall multipoles that are determined by the metric in a compact region .",
    "dixon s definition in @xcite falls in this class .",
    "these multipoles are given in the form of source integrals .",
    "however , it is not yet known how they are related with the asymptotic multipole moments .",
    "a main application of these multipoles is in the theory of the motion of test bodies with internal structure .",
    "but for test bodies it is obvious that there can not be any such relation between dixon s multipole moments and the asymptotic multipole moments .",
    "furthermore , dixon s definition is in general not applicable if caustics of geodesics appear inside the source , i.e. , if the gravitational field is too strong compared to a characteristic radius of the source .",
    "ashtekar et al .",
    "defined in @xcite multipole moments of isolated horizons .",
    "these are also source integrals and require only the knowledge of the interior geometry of the horizon . in @xcite , it was also shown that the so defined multipoles of the kerr black hole deviate from the gh multipoles .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced the greater the rotation parameter . in both cases",
    "@xcite , it is interesting to find the relation of these multipole moments to asymptotically defined gh multipole moments and their physical interpretation .",
    "source integrals might proof useful in this respect .",
    "other definitions , in particular for the quasi - local mass and the quasi - local angular momentum , can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we aim at source integrals for _ all _ multipole moments in static spacetimes for arbitrary sources , i.e. , we want to express asymptotic multipole moments by surface or volume integrals , where the surface envelopes or the volume covers all the sources of the gravitational field . that such source integrals can be found , is not at all obvious .",
    "this is because of the non - linear nature of the einstein equations yielding a gravitational field , which acts again as a source . to overcome the principle difficulties",
    ", we will focus here on static and axially symmetric spacetimes . in this case",
    ", the vacuum einstein equations can be cast in an essentially linear form .",
    "additionally , they allow the introduction of a linear system @xcite .",
    "the latter might seem superfluous , if the the former holds .",
    "however , we will derive our source integrals relying solely on the existence of the linear system and the applicability of the inverse scattering technique .",
    "this will allow us in future work to apply the same formalism to stationary and axially symmetric isolated systems .",
    "this is especially relevant for the description of relativistic stars , where many applications are .",
    "a generalization to spacetimes with an einstein - maxwell field exterior to the sources seems also feasible . in all these cases , multipole moments of the gh type exist .",
    "source integrals will prove useful in many respects , in particular in the search of global solutions of einstein equations describing figures of equilibrium or relativistic stars , for recent efforts see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "for example , an exterior solution can be constructed for a known interior solution by employing the source integrals to calculate its multipole moments . from these",
    "the exterior solution can be completely determined .",
    "this yields an exterior solution , which does not necessarily match to the interior solution .",
    "however , if it does not , this construction shows that there is _ no _ asymptotically flat solution , which can be matched to the given interior .",
    "conversely , possible matter sources can be analyzed for given exterior solutions and their multipole moments .",
    "the latter approach is also of astrophysical interest , since often only the asymptotics of the gravitational field and the asymptotic multipole moments are accessible to experiments .",
    "source integrals can be employed to , e.g. , restrict the equation of state of a rotating perfect fluid from observed multipole moments .",
    "furthermore , source integrals can be used to compare numerical solutions , analytical solutions and analytical approximations by calculating their multipole moments , see for example @xcite .",
    "this can also be used to approximate the vacuum exterior of a given numerical solution by an analytical one , which exhibits the correct multipole moments up to a prescribed order , see @xcite .",
    "the merit of source integrals lies in the fact that they determine the multipole moments using the matter region only , which captures the internal structure of the relativistic object and is usually determined with high accuracy .",
    "additionally , source integrals provide the means to test the accuracy of numerical methods , which are used to determine relativistic stars , cf .",
    "@xcite , by calculating the multipole moments in two independent ways : firstly , using the asymptotics and , secondly , using the source integrals",
    ". this will give also a physical interpretation to possible deviations .",

    "greek indices run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , lower - case latin indices run from @xmath6 to @xmath5 and upper - case latin indices from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "we consider static and axially symmetric spacetimes admitting a timelike killing vector @xmath8 and a spacelike killing vector @xmath9 , which commutes with @xmath8 , has closed timelike curves and vanishes at the axis of rotation . if the orbits of the so defined isometry group admit orthogonal 2-surfaces , which is the case in vacuum , in static perfect fluids or static electromagnetic fields , see , e.g. , @xcite , then the metric can be written in the weyl form : @xmath10 where the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that the metric functions @xmath15 and @xmath12 can be expressed by the killing vectors : @xmath16    the einstein equations can be inferred from the ones given in @xcite . since we will not specify the matter , we give only a complete set of combinations of the non - vanishing components of the ricci tensor :    [ eq : field_equations ] @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",

    "the last two equations determine @xmath26 via a line integration once @xmath15 is known .",
    "this @xmath26 automatically satisfies the last equation in .",
    "hence , only a laplace equation for @xmath15 remains to be solved .",
    "therefore , the newtonian theory and general relativity can be treated on the same formal footing .",
    "we will do so here and highlight the difference in sec .",
    "[ sec : properties ] .",
    "the disadvantage of using the canonical weyl coordinates is that they can not necessarily be introduced in the interior of the matter , where we have to use other ( non - canonical ) weyl coordinates .     and",

    "the curves @xmath30 and @xmath31 are relevant in sec . [ sec : linear_problem_laplace ] . not that this serves only as illustration and that under a certain energy condition and separation condition static @xmath32-body solutions do not exist , for details see @xcite .",
    "[ fig : curves ] ]    the physical setting , which we want to investigate , is as follows : we have in a compact region @xmath28 of a hypersurface given by @xmath33 several sources , cf .",

    "note that inside @xmath28 it will in general be not possible to introduce canonical weyl coordinates .",
    "the sources can be matter distributions supported in @xmath29 with @xmath35 .",
    "if there are black hole sources with horizons @xmath36 , we assume that there is vacuum at least in a neighborhood of @xmath36 , which necessary for static black holes , see , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "thus , the system has no mass or any other multipole moment , which implies flat space in the vacuum region .",
    "this is clearly a contradiction to a dust source with positive mass density .",
    "we have derived in this article source integrals or quasi - local expressions for weyl s multipole moments and , thus , for geroch s multipole moments for axially symmetric and stationary sources .",
    "these source integrals can either be written as surface integrals or volume integrals . a priori",
    ", one could not expect to find any kind of source integrals at all , because of the non - linear nature of the einstein equations . that this is possible in the here considered setting , seems not to be due to the staticity and axially symmetry and the peculiarly simple form of the field equations .",
    "but rather a linear system must be available offering a notion of integrability of the einstein equation .",
    "thus , it appears feasible to find source integrals not only for stationary and axially symmetric isolated systems , which describe vacuum , but also electrovacuum close to spatial infinity .",
    "these generalizations will be investigated in future work .",
    "it should also be clarified , how the source integrals are connected to the already known source integrals for isolated horizons @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the source integrals characterize the horizon uniquely .",
    "however , they do not reproduce the gh multipole moments of a kerr black hole . in our approach , the agreement of the source integrals and the asymptotically defined weyl or geroch multipole moments is given by construction .",
    "therefore , these source integrals might prove useful for identifying the contributions to the multipole moments , which yield the discrepancies between the isolated horizon multipole moments and those of geroch and hansen .",
