    "star clusters are self - gravitating newtonian systems of choice where to brew complex gravitational dynamics ( meylan & heggie 1997 for a review ) . observations of old , globular , stellar clusters have led to the formulation of spherically symmetric dynamical models of equilibria .",
    "the most successful and universally studied one - integral spherical models are the king ( 1966 ) profiles .",
    "however , surveys of up to 100 milky way clusters have found small but significant departures from spherical symmetry ( white & shawl 1987 ) : fits to their projected isophotes yield ellipticities @xmath1 . a study of 173 clusters in m31 found @xmath2 ( staneva , spassova & golev 1996 ) .",
    "observations of young clusters in the large magellanic cloud revealed isophotal contours with ellipticities as large as @xmath3 ( elson , fall & freeman 1987 ; kontizas et al .",
    "this raises the possibility that clusters are formed as strongly flattened structures which then evolve towards rounder configurations ( cf . frenk & fall 1982 ; boily , clarke & murray 1999 ; theis & spurzem 1999 ) , and brings up important theoretical issues concerning processes which may drive this evolution .",
    "rotation stretches any stellar association along a preferred axis : observations of the clusters @xmath0centauri and m13 have shown that they are flattened by rotation ( meylan & mayor 1986 ; merritt , meylan & mayor 1997 ; lupton , gunn & griffin 1987 ) .",
    "thus angular momentum , measured or possibly lost during evolution , offers a way to account for the morphology of clusters . yet to date there are few evolutionary models of clusters with initial angular momentum .",
    "we have started on a project to develop three - dimensional dynamical models of rotating star clusters . in this",
    "articles results for two n - body models of isolated clusters are presented .",
    "previous modelling of rotating clusters is reviewed first .",
    "agekian ( 1958 ) considered the effects of angular momentum diffusion on the equilibria of rotating fluid masses of uniform density . in his analysis ,",
    "concentric spheroids rotating about their minor axis become rounder in time when the spheroids have initially an ellipticity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the minor and major axes .",
    "shapiro & marchant ( 1976 ) integrated the equations of motion for this fluid in the limit of adiabatic ( slow ) diffusion of momentum .",
    "angular momentum losses are driven by mass elements moving in the direction of the stream leaving the system at a rate higher than those moving in the opposite direction .",
    "the energy required for escape comes from ` heat ' , attributed to two - body encounters .",
    "thus , angular momentum losses are accrued over a local two - body relaxation timescale , @xmath7 , which is inversely proportional to the mass density @xmath8 . in practice",
    "this hinders applications of the results to actual clusters , which show centrally peaked density profiles ( meylan & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the framework set by agekian provides a start in linking rotating bodies and observed ( non - rotating ) globular clusters .    with zero rotation",
    ", the central region of a cluster evolves towards a cusp in density during what is known as the gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "does rotation stop the formation of a cusp ?",
    "hachisu ( 1979 , 1982 ) discussed the time - evolution of self - gravitating cylindrical distributions of gas with angular momentum .",
    "he predicted a runaway collapse of the central region whenever angular momentum is expelled faster than a critical rate ( see also lagoute & longaretti 1996 ) .",
    "hachisu dubbed this the ` gravo - gyro catastrophe ' , by analogy with the non - rotating case .",
    "these were until recently the only evolutionary models of rotating clusters .",
    "two - dimensional orbit - averaged fokker - planck methods have now also been developed to address this issue .",
    "following goodman s ( 1983 ) approach , einsel & spurzem ( 1999 ) integrated the fokker - planck equation in energy - momentum space @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "their initial configurations are truncated king models with added bulk motion .",
    "this velocity field takes the form of a maxwellian distribution such that the mean velocity scales in proportion to radius away from the centre , then drops off at large radii . their adopted axisymmetric distribution function ( cf .",
    "lupton , gunn & griffin 1987 )    @xmath10\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the inverse square central velocity dispersion and @xmath12 an angular velocity .",
    "the initial conditions are fixed by specifying the dimensionless parameters @xmath13 ie , the scales of angular momentum and gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "the latter is the king parameter .    in the 2d fokker - planck models",
    "core - collapse proceeds on a much shorter timescale than in the non - rotating case , confirming hachisu s early intuition .",
    "however the central angular velocity does not increase at the high rates expected during the on - set of a gravo - gyro catastrophe ; however near the end of core - collapse the central velocity dispersion bears the same relation to the central density as in the non - rotating self - similar collapse .",
    "this leaves open the question of what controls the final phase of evolution in these systems , ie whether or not rotation truly survives up to core - collapse .",
    "we chose to approach this problem using three - dimensional numerical integration ; the setup is summarised below , followed by results and a discussion .",
    "self - consistent n - body realisations of the distribution function were obtained from the equilibrium fokker - planck code fopax developed by christian einsel .",
    "the models are fully specified once values are assigned to @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : ics ] illustrates the properties of a set of models of 10,000 particles with @xmath15 and four values of @xmath16 .",
    "the model clusters rotate about the z - axis and the equator lies in the x - y plane of a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "rotation causes the cluster in equilibrium to flatten down the z - axis and this is shown from computing the components of the inertia tensor @xmath17 for a series of twenty concentric spherical shells of equal mass @xmath18 .",
    "we define    @xmath19   \\equiv 1 - \\frac{2 \\ i_{zz } } { i_{xx } + i_{yy } } \\ , \\",

    "models with rotation have @xmath25 and a range of values for @xmath24 increasing with it .",
    "note that all models , save one with @xmath26 , have values of @xmath24 compatible with sphericity at the centre . at larger radii ,",
    "the models are all distinguished from one another .",
    "fast - rotating models need be more compact in order to sustain the accrued centrifugal force ,    @xmath27 which must always be smaller than the gravitational force , giving the condition    @xmath28    thus at constant mass @xmath29 the system radius @xmath30 must be smaller to allow for larger angular speed @xmath31 .",
    "this is illustrated on figure [ fig : ics ] , which displays @xmath24 and @xmath31 computed from the same set of particles .",
    "all models show @xmath31 decreasing with radius .",
    "note that the curves are consistent with solid - body rotation in the core - region .",
    "further out @xmath31 declines to near - zero , in a trend opposite that of @xmath24 . the core remains roundish despite the large angular speed because the gravity is relatively stronger there than near the edge , and so random motion of the particles dominate over streaming motion .",
    "overall the fraction of kinetic energy invested in streaming motion ranges from 0% to 4% , 14% and 26% in increasing order of @xmath16 . for comparisons ,",
    "the cluster @xmath0centauri invests perhaps as much as 22 % of its kinetic energy in rotation ( merritt , meylan & mayor 1997 ) .",

    "it has been ported to parallel architecture ( spurzem 2000 ) ; the calculations were performed on cray computers linked up with mpi library .",
    "the code treats particles as point - masses and stellar evolution options were switched off .",
    "the chain - regularisation algorithm for hierarchical stellar encounters as well as the standard ` ks ' regularisation ( mikkola & aarseth 1998 ; aarseth 1999 ) ensures high - precision integration during close interactions . only simulations with n = 5,000 equal - mass particles will be discussed .",
    "there are no external tides .",
    "figures [ fig : corecollapse ] & [ fig : angmomentum ] illustrate the time - evolution of the models . the central density , total angular momentum and mean and core radii are plotted as function of time in units of the two - body relaxation time @xmath7 ( see meylan & heggie 1997 ; casertano & hut 1985 ) .",
    "( note : the lengths were normalised to their initial values . )",
    "the top panels show evolution for the case of @xmath32 , the bottom set for @xmath26 .",
    "looking at these diagrams we find an evolution of the central density similar to the standard case with no rotation : the contraction of the central region leads to more close encounters and ejection , hence further contraction ensues , etc , until @xmath33 when the density peaks sharply , indicating core - collapse : at the end of the simulations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , for @xmath32 and 0.8 . at constant energy ,",
    "core - contraction drives the expansion of the outer envelope and hence the mean radius expands rapidly at core - collapse .",
    "note a subtle but noticeable difference between the two simulations , namely that the cluster with initially more rotation evolves faster ; this is particularly visible in a comparison of radii at fixed time .",
    "a more convincing demonstration of the fast evolution of such clusters follows if we recall that in this unit of time , clusters without rotation reach core - collapse in around @xmath36 , which is more than twice as long .    to appreciate how many stars might be lost to galactic tides ,",
    "were a tidal field present , we imagine the cluster orbiting the galaxy on a circular orbit . a tidal radius",
    "may then be defined from the initial configuration , by computing the radius @xmath37 at which the mean density at time @xmath38 equates the initial mean density : @xmath39 \\times ( m[t]/m[0 ] ) ^{1/3 } $ ] .",
    "if we label as escapers all stars found outside @xmath40 , we obtain an estimate of the number of stars likely to leave the cluster on a timescale short compared with @xmath7 ; the angular momentum they carry with them is deduced from summing up all the momenta of the stars left behind , and comparing with the initial value . implementing this algorithm",
    ", we found the run with @xmath41 ( top panels ) would have lost 3.7% of the initial angular momentum over the time of evolution , but only 1.0% ( 51:5000 ) of its mass .",
    "the second model , with more rotation , would have lost 0.96% ( 48:5000 ) of its mass , but only 1.4% of its total momentum to such escapers .",
    "this shows how the cluster redistributes angular momentum efficiently within itself , such that the core evolves towards core - collapse despite added rotational support .",
    "evolution in the core is faster , the faster the core rotates initially , since the cluster is more compact ( cf .",
    "[ eq : centrifugal ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ics ] ) which speeds up two - body effects .",
    "figure [ fig : angmomentum ] graphs the specific angular momentum of the @xmath26 cluster as a function of radius @xmath42 for three different times . for comparison ,",
    "two components are given : the z - axis component about which the cluster rotates ; and the x - axis component .",
    "dividing the cluster in ten concentric shells , we computed @xmath43 and summed up the momenta in each shell : the result is the series of black squares shown on the figure . initially",
    "the ( net ) z - angular momentum increases steadily from the centre , outwards ; the symmetry of the figure would make the sum over @xmath44 s cancel out , and the black squares have been left out for this quantity .",
    "evolution is monotonic , with the net z - momenta inside @xmath45pc decreasing , from which we deduce that an increasing fraction of the momentum is transferred to the volume @xmath46pc .",
    "notice on figure [ fig : angmomentum ] that the stars form a core around @xmath47pc in the final stage of the simulation ( right - most panels ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this is the result of an @xmath48 ( lopsided ) instability , attributable to the dynamics of the system ( from a d.f .",
    "point of view ) , or a case of core - wandering , likely due to the small number of particles inside @xmath49pc ( sweatman 1993 ) .",
    "the faster evolution of clusters with rotation has been illustrated with two sample runs .",
    "the time to core - collapse we found from three - dimensional n - body simulations are in agreement with two - dimensional fokker - planck calculations ( einsel & spurzem 1999 ) : the collapse time of 5.4 @xmath7 obtained for the @xmath26 agrees with the fokker - planck solution of 5.6 @xmath7 for these parameters .",
    "this increases confidence in the results up to core collapse , obtained with two different algorithms .",
