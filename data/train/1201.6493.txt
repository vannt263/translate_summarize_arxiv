    "magnetic multilayered films have been receiving much attention from the research community in the field of spintronics .",
    "recently , a device has been proposed @xcite and demonstrated @xcite , in which the magnetic and spin - transport properties are controlled thermo - electrically . at the core of",
    "the new design is a tri - layer ( _ f / f / f _ ) of two strong ferromagnets ( _ f _ ) exchange - coupled by a weakly ferromagnetic spacer ( _ f _ ) having the curie point at / or near room temperature ( @xmath3  k ) .",
    "the spacer  _ f _ , controlling the exchange coupling between the outer layers , can be made of a diluted ferromagnetic alloy , such as ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is desirable that the spacer is compositionally uniform and does not contain multiple phases , which can form as a result of atomic segregation during film deposition or subsequent heat treatment .",
    "alloys ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 in their bulk form are _ fcc _ binary substitution alloys ( @xmath4-phase ) , with ni and cu mutually solvable in any proportion up to the temperature of 627  k , where at @xmath5 , the @xmath4 phase separates into two , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the phase diagram contains a metastable region with phase separation at the nickel concentration of @xmath8 , which can lead to additional magneto - structural inhomogeneities in the system .",
    "the results , obtained in this work , however , are obtained using an empirical model , based on the experimental data .",
    "it is desirable to independently simulate the phase equilibria in the system ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 , first without using experimental information and then compare the results with the experimental findings . of particular interest is the influence of the magnetic interactions in the system on the potential structural and/or compositional phase separation .",
    "the curie temperature of bulk ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 alloys depends linearly on the ni concentration @xcite . by varying the ni content from 0.5 to 1",
    "the curie temperature is changed from 0 k to 627 k. however , based on neutron scattering data , it was shown that both bulk samples @xcite and sputtered films of ni - cu alloys @xcite exhibit partial phase separation and form ni rich clusters of typical size @xmath9   and magnetic moment @xmath10  @xmath11 .",
    "the formation of such ni clusters and the resulting magnetic inhomogeneity in the material can lead to anomalous magnetic @xcite and transport @xcite properties .    in this work",

    "we discuss optimum ways to prepare films with enhanced magneto - structural homogeneity .",
    "films of diluted ferromagnetic ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 alloys , with @xmath12 in ni concentration , 100 nm thick , were deposited at room temperature on thermally oxidized si substrates using dc magnetron co - sputtering from cu and ni targets .",
    "substrates of @xmath13 mm in size , placed above the cu and ni targets , along the line connecting the centers of the targets , were used to produce a continuous and essentially linear compositional gradient along the substrate strip . the base pressure in",

    "the thickness of the films was determined using a surface profilometer .",
    "the composition of the films was determined using x - ray dispersion spectroscopy analysis .",
    "ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) was used to determine the effective magnetization of the ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 films ( @xmath18 ) and their curie temperature ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "fmr measurements were performed at @xmath20 ghz using a bruker elexsys - e500 spectrometer equipped with a goniometer for angle - dependent measurements and a variable temperature cryostat .",
    "the effective magnetization was obtained from the resonance fields using the kittel formulae @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the measured perpendicular and in - plane fmr resonance fields , respectively , @xmath24  frequency , and @xmath25  the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the curie temperature of the films was determined from the fmr data as temperature at which either @xmath18 or the fmr signal vanished .",

    "it follows from ( [ fmreqh ] ) that for a strong magnetostrictive contribution and/or small saturation magnetization , the effective magnetization can become negative , which corresponds to its perpendicular - to - the - plane orientation in the absence of external fields  @xcite .",

    "it is also seen from the data that the degree of non - uniformity depends on the concentration in ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 films .",
    "thus , at small cu concentrations , @xmath62 , the alloy has a narrow fmr line indicating relatively good magneto - structural uniformity . for higher cu concentrations , @xmath63 , the fmr line broadens , which indicates a higher magnetic non - uniformity .",
    "this , combined with the observed enhanced @xmath19 from ni clustering , indicates that in this interesting concentration range near the metastable region of the phase diagram the films can become structurally non - uniform , possibly consisting from multiple compositional phases .",
    "below we examine theoretically the microscopic mechanism of phase separation in the system , taking into account the interatomic magnetic interactions .",
    "there are no direct experimental confirmations that magnetic interactions in ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 could be responsible for additional phase equilibria in the system .",
    "temperatures required for reaching equilibrium conditions are difficult to attain experimentally , if at all possible . nevertheless , it was predicted @xcite that in ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 alloys with @xmath64 a metastable miscibility gap should exist due to magnetic interactions . for describing the magnetic contribution to the free energy , the authors of @xcite used a model proposed by chuang @xcite .",
    "the model contains an empirical expression for the heat capacity of a ferromagnetic alloy , with adjustable parameters obtained from the experiment . in order to obtain a deeper insight into whether such miscibility gap could indeed exist and be due to magnetic interactions , it is highly desirable to first construct a solid state phase diagram of ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 system using experiment - independent first - principle calculations of interatomic interactions , and then compare the results with the experiment .",
    "cu@xmath1 films , measured at different temperatures . ]    for describing the ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 alloy we use a model hamiltonian taking into account the ni - ni exchange interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is similar to the one used in @xcite for describing fe@xmath0ni@xmath1 alloys .",
    "the approach relies on a lattice model , with each site @xmath65 of the _ fcc _ lattice being occupied either by an atom of ni ( @xmath66 ) or cu ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the atomic fraction of ni ( @xmath52 ) will be taken as @xmath68 .",
    "the magnetic interactions between the ni atoms in the system are described by the classical isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "since the local magnetic moment of cu atoms is negligible , the magnetic interactions of cu - cu and cu - ni are omitted .",
    "thus , the model hamiltonian of the system is : @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the mixing potentials responsible for `` chemical '' interactions between the atoms , @xmath71  magnetic exchange constants for ni - ni interactions ( independent of concentration @xmath68 ) , @xmath72  vector of unit length along the direction of the ni local magnetic moment .",
    "values of unknowns @xmath70 for first 4 coordination shells and @xmath71 for 2 shells were obtained as solutions of a system of equations ( [ eqce ] ) for a set of ordered superstructures representing the ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 alloys .",
    "the structures have various distributions of nickel atoms and different magnetic ordering .",
    "since the most interesting region of the phase diagram is at high concentrations of ni , 5 superstructures of composition cuni@xmath73 ( 32 atoms per unit cell , ferromagnetic ordering ) and 3 structures of pure ni with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering were selected .",
    "the total free energy of the structures were calculated within the density functional theory ( dft ) using the flapw method ( wien2k package @xcite ) .",

    "a similar miscibility gap exists in the fe - ni system ( phases @xmath86 , @xmath87 @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of this miscibility gap in ni@xmath88cu@xmath1 system results in additional equilibria of phases with close compositions but different magnetic properties and , importantly , different curie temperatures .",
    "the presence of different phases in the alloy should broaden the magnetic transition , which is indeed observed in our ni@xmath88cu@xmath1 films .    possibly due to our ni atomic magnetic moments taken to be independent of composition , the obtained theoretical @xmath19 versus composition ( fig .",
    "[ phasediag2 ] ) deviates from the measured one ( fig .",
    "[ phasediag1 ] ) .",
    "it should also be mentioned , that in contrast to the results of @xcite , our calculations show that the additional miscibility gap is stable .",
    "thus , our ab - initio numerical theoretical analysis , not relying on experimental data , shows additional phase equilibria in the ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 system at high concentrations of ni .",
    "these additional equilibria are due to the ferromagnetic interactions in the system .    using the expression for the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ eqfreeenrg ] ) it is possible to obtain the general condition for the existence of an additional miscibility gap . for this",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the following quantities : @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the lines of the spinodal and magnetic transformations intersect at point _ a _ ( fig .",
    "[ phasediag2 ] ) , which gives two conditions : @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the expressions for the spontaneous magnetization near @xmath19 , @xmath93 : @xmath94 , and that for the curie temperature @xmath95 , yield the following equation for the concentration at point _ a _ : @xmath96 thus : @xmath97 condition @xmath98 yields for the interaction parameters : @xmath99 , this in turn gives the concentration range for the miscibility gap : @xmath100 . to sum up , for binary alloys with decomposition ( @xmath101 ) and with one element being ferromagnetic ( @xmath102 )",
    ", there must exist an additional miscibility gap due to the inter - atomic magnetic interactions .",
    "the obtained phase diagram indicates that the magnetic and structural properties of the samples should strongly depend on the temperature of fabrication ( substrate temperature for films ) .",
    "specifically , quenching the material on to substrates is expected to be beneficial for the uniformity of the films . here ,",
    "a uniform mixing of the two elements in the magnetron plasma flux is frozen in on the substrate before the magnetic atoms have time to interact by exchange .",
    "if annealed at a sufficiently high temperature and then cooled slowly , the exchange interaction in the film is expected to result in atomic diffusion as to favor ni - clustering and therefore partial phase separation into a ni - rich and cu - rich phases , as discussed above .",
    "diluted ferromagnetic alloy films ni@xmath0cu@xmath1 obtained by magnetron sputtering exhibit partial phase separation into ni - rich and cu - rich phases .",
    "the phase separation is more pronounced for higher cu dilution and leads to a broadening of the ferro- to paramagnetic phase transition in the system .",
    "this process is modeled using ab - initio calculations , taking into account the magnetic interactions in the system .",
    "our analysis shows that the phase separation in the concentration range of interest is due to the ni - ni exchange interaction , which favors clustering of ni and thereby compositional gradients in the alloy .",
    "this can additionally lead to a significantly non - linear dependence of the curie temperature on the alloy concentration .",
    "our analysis further suggests that the general nature of the observed phase separation in ni - cu , namely the exchange - induced magnetic atom clustering in an otherwise perfectly solvable two - component system , should be found in other diluted alloys of magnetic - nonmagnetic or strongly magnetic - weakly magnetic elements and likewise lead to magneto - structural inhomogeneities there .",
