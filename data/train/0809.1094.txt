    "the uncertainties in the brightness corrections of type ia supernovae ( snia ) for color excess is among the largest systematic uncertainties in the use of type ia supernovae to measure cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the standard interpretation of color excess being due to extinction by interstellar dust in the supernova host galaxy has recently been challenged by the empirically deduced color - brightness relation for snia .",
    "while studies of differential extinction of quasars shining through foreground galaxies yield values of @xmath1 compatible with the average mw value @xcite values to individual qso systems have been found in e.g. @xcite and @xcite ] , the snia hubble diagram scatter is minimized for values significantly smaller than @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of snia for cosmology benefits significantly from the understanding the extinction law for the full optical and near - ir wavelength range . e.g. the wavelength dependence of extinction toward the magellanic clouds differ from the milky - way extinction law in @xcite , even for very similar values of @xmath3 . for quasar sight - lines ,",
    "@xcite tested both milky - way like extinction as well as small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction law , both giving comparable goodness of fit .",
    "a preference for smc dust for extinction of agns has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "recently , the detection of circumstellar ( cs ) matter in the local environment surrounding the type ia supernova sn2006x in the nearby galaxy m100 has been reported by @xcite . a shell within a few @xmath4 cm ( @xmath5 pc ) of the center of the explosion has been suggested to explain the time - variable na i d lines in the sn spectrum .",
    "@xcite report @xmath6 and @xmath7 mag for sn2006x and a light echo in the lightcurve was found by @xcite consistent with dust illuminated at a distance of 27 - 170 pc from the site of the explosion .",
    "even if the local environment around this supernova may not be very common among snia , similar values for the total to selective extinction ratio have been reported for several snia with good wavelength coverage . e.g. @xcite found @xmath8 for sn 1999cl ; @xcite report @xmath9 and @xmath10 for sn2003cg and sn 2002cv respectively .",
    "furthermore , a statistical study of optical colors of a sample including 80 near - by snia , found an average value of @xmath11 for snia with @xmath120.7 , and even lower for a subsample of low - reddening snia .",
    "next , we examine the possibility that low values of @xmath3 stem from the semi - diffusive propagation of photons in the neighborhood of the site of the supernova explosion .",
    "photon propagation around a medium of scatterers can be described by a quasi random - walk picture .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a beautiful introduction to this subject .",
    "lets consider a localized distribution of dust particles within a distance @xmath13 from the explosion site , negligibly small compared to the distance to the observer , @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 , where @xmath16 corresponds to the radius from where the sn radiation emerges .",
    "the trajectory of a photon will be straight until it hits a dust particle at which point the photon can either be scattered or absorbed .",
    "if the photon is scattered in a new direction , it follows a straight path until the next encounter , and so on until @xmath17 .",
    "the mean free path between interactions , @xmath18 , is thus determined by the number density of scatterers , @xmath19 , and their effective cross - section for scattering and absorption of light , @xmath20 : @xmath21    for @xmath22 , the single scattering approximation is valid and the light beam reaching the observer is attenuated as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "this is the case applicable for extinction by dust in the interstellar medium .    for @xmath25",
    ", corresponding to a ( local ) high number density of scatterers , the situation is different .",
    "if the absorption probability is much lower than for scattering , photon propagation is diffusive and the average properties can described analytically using the formulas for random - walk @xcite .",
    "the case we are considering here is for @xmath26 , where the scattering cross - section exceeds the absorption cross - section , @xmath27 , in a wavelength dependent manner .",
    "in particular , we examine the cases where the light scattering properties of dust particles in the cs matter are similar to what has been modeled for interstellar dust grains the milky - way @xcite or the lmc @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] shows the the wavelength dependent albedo factor ( @xmath28 ) and the average of the cosine of the scattering angle for interactions between light and dust particles .",
    "also tabulated is the absorption cross - section divided by dust mass .",
    "note that the milky - way parameters correspond to a dust size distribution matching @xmath2 for dimming of stars in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite considered the impact of circumstellar dust upon the measured value of @xmath3 , but only the extreme case where all scattered photons may reach the observer .",
    "that assumption overlooks an important aspect of the problem : while the bluer photons scatter more , they also are more likely to be absorbed .",
    "this leads to a steeper wavelength dependence of the effective extinction law , possibly explaining the unusual total to selective extinction ratios found in studies of snia .",
    "in order to estimate the net effect of scattering and absorption on the light reaching the outer edge of a shell of circumstellar dust around the sn site , @xmath13 , a monte - carlo simulation was performed .",
    "photons with energies corresponding to the central wavelengths of the @xmath29 photometric system were generated and subsequently followed as they propagate in the dusty medium .",
    "a uniform distribution of scatterers within a sphere of radius @xmath13 is used in the calculations .",
    "our treatment is rather insensitive of the physical size of @xmath13 since what governs the differences in path - lengths of photons at different wavelengths are the optical depths , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , for a fixed color excess , a larger @xmath13 can be compensated by a lower number density , @xmath19 , thus keeping @xmath32 and @xmath33 unchanged .",
    "figure  [ fig : tau ] shows the wavelength dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath32 in our calculation for mw and lmc dust types for a reddening at @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "the key observation is that at short wavelengths , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 increase , while @xmath32 dominates .",
    "since they scatter more , photons with short wavelength leaving the cs region to eventually reach the observer must propagate a larger path - length than photons at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , since @xmath33 also increases at shorter wavelengths , the relative attenuation of bluer photons is enhanced , thus generating an effective extinction law with steeper wavelength dependence , i.e. lower @xmath3 .    smc - type dust , as parameterized in @xcite ,",
    "has a smaller albedo in the optical to near - ir region ( see fig .  23 in @xcite ) ,",
    "leading to a larger value of @xmath33 compared to lmc or mw dust .",
    "thus , smc dust is not suitable to explain the anomalous sn colors with the scenario presented in this work .",
    "for each photon starting at @xmath36 , straight path - lengths between interactions ( @xmath37,@xmath38 ) were generated from an exponential distributions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where the mean free path for scattering and absorption , @xmath41 and @xmath42 were calculated from the wavelength dependent parameters in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the scattering angle for each interaction was generated in the simulation following the henyey - greenstein approximation @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( also listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . the density of dust in the shell was varied to cover a wide range of reddening at @xmath34 , @xmath45 .",
    "the probability for photons to reach @xmath13 without absorption is calculated by repeating the ray - tracing monte - carlo @xmath46 times for each wavelength .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvvsebv ] shows that the attenuation of light after the circumstellar shell yields low values of @xmath48 , as anticipated . in particular , the simulations using lmc dust , result in an effective @xmath49 , compatible with the best fit result of .",
    "we note , however , that the ccm extinction law @xcite does not accurately reproduce the wavelength dependence of photons attenuation over the entire optical range , as shown in figure  [ fig : extlaw ] .",
    "the deviations are significant for the u - b color , in agreement with the observations reported in @xcite .",
    "instead , a power - law relation gives a good fit to the simulations ( see figure  [ fig : fitfun ] ) : @xmath50    where @xmath51 @xmath52 m is the central wavelength of the v - band filter . since the attenuation at b - band ( central wavelength @xmath53 ) is given by @xmath54 , the parameters in equation  ( [ eq : power ] ) are related to @xmath3 as @xmath55^{-1}\\\\   = { 1 \\over   a \\left(0.8^p -1\\right)}\\ ] ] it is encouraging for the use of type ia sne for precision cosmology that the reddening corrections may take a simple and general analytical form , if the model is confirmed .",
    "further studies of sn colors , also including near - ir data , should be used to test this relation .",
    "simple simulations show that circumstellar material , detected in at least one type ia supernova , sn2006x @xcite , could potentially explain the empirically determined extinction law for low redshift snia , especially if the circumstellar material resembles lmc dust grains . adopting the cs shell size of @xcite , @xmath56 cm",
    ", we find that for @xmath57 , the required mass in dust around the supernova is @xmath58 when inserting typical values of the absorption cross - section from table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "depending on the thickness of the cs shell , shifts in the time of lightcurve maximum may be expected for different bands since the amount of quasi random - walk will differ . in particular",
    ", photons in redder bands will suffer less scattering and thereby less time delay .",
    "this effect should correlate with the measured reddening , @xmath59 .",
    "the assumption of a uniform density is not expected to be critical for the results at first order . however , a second order effect may be expected since a large scale of @xmath13 would result in a longer time for photons being `` trapped '' in the scattering sphere . as the the intrinsic colors of type ia change on a time scale of days , time delays of photons of that time scale would affect the measured colors as a function of time .    in a forthcoming paper , potential direct observables from interaction between photons and dust will be investigated . also , the sensitivity of the effective extinction law to the dust grain sizes and density profile in cs medium and the combination of both scattering in the circumstellar material and the interstellar medium needs to be further investigated . if the presence of cs material is indeed the source of the color - brightness relation found in snia , the case for restframe near - ir observations is further strengthened : the peak magnitude corrections , and their model dependence , are smaller than at optical wavelengths .",
