    "oligopoly is defined as a market structure where there are normally a few large sellers .",
    "duopoly is a special case of oligopoly , where only two firms compete with each other @xcite .",
    "actually there are a number of market possibilities that could be called oligopoly ( or duopoly ) : a market with a few , large manufacturers selling the same product ( e.g. power producers , electricity utilities @xcite , steel or oil refining industries ) ; a market with a few , large producers selling a differentiated product ( e.g. baby food , beer , cereal or automobile industries ) ; or even a market with one large seller and some smaller sellers ( e.g. aircraft ( boeing ) , soup ( campbell ) , film ( kodak ) or detergent ( procter & gamble ) industries ) . if fact , in most countries markets are dominated by one or a handful of firms .",
    "this is normal and expected behavior @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes oligopoly ( or duopoly ) from the other forms of market structure is that the firms in an oligopolistic market must be aware of and be judging the reaction of other firms on the market @xcite . with a finite number of sellers",
    "there is often intense competition with respect to price , quality , and quantity produced .",
    "this is where advertising enters the picture .",
    "consumers need information about product characteristics and prices to make rational ( efficient ) decisions .",
    "advertising can be a low - cost means of providing it .",
    "moreover , by supplying information about the various competing goods that are available , advertising diminishes monopoly power .",
    "in fact , advertising is frequently associated with the introduction of new products designed to compete with existing brands @xcite . could toyota and honda have so strongly challenged u.s .",
    "auto producers without advertising ? could federal express have sliced market share away from ups and the u.s .",
    "postal service without advertising ?",
    "how about dialog , an upstart private telecom in southern poland , which recently has gained market share from long - time monopolist telekomunikacja polska ?    when is advertising effective and when is it not ?",
    "this question has often stimulated heated debate in the world of marketing and advertising @xcite . in this paper",
    "we try to answer the above question via monte carlo simulations of a simple , two - dimensional ising spin model .",
    "an ising spin system , probably the most often used model in statistical physics , is a system with binary variables .",
    "these variables have been successfully interpreted as occupied / empty sites in percolation theory @xcite , up / down steps in dna walk @xcite , healthy / sick individuals in genetics @xcite , bulls / bears in financial markets @xcite or government / opposition in political models @xcite . in our case",
    "they correspond to product a / product b customers .",
    "we model a generic duopoly market by a two - dimensional lattice @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions . each site of the lattice is `` occupied '' by an individual ( a customer ) , who is characterized by a spin , s , that represents his / her support for one of the two equivalent products in the market .",
    "the spin can be either an up - spin ( customer of product a , e.g. dialog telecom , denoted by @xmath1 ) or a down - spin ( customer of product b , e.g. long - time monopolist telekomunikacja polska , denoted by @xmath2 ) .    for a given set of rules , governing the behavior of the customers , we study the system via monte carlo simulations .",
    "in contrast to usual majority rules @xcite , in our model the influence does not flow inward from the surrounding neighbors to the center site(s ) , but spreads outward from the center to the neighbors .",
    "the model thus describes the spread of opinions .",
    "this approach is borrowed from the original one - dimensional sznajd model @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) , where two people forming a nearest - neighbor bond and sharing the same opinion convinced their neighbors of this opinion . in the two - dimensional setup",
    "it is natural to select a `` panel '' of four neighboring sites which may influence their eight nearest neighbors ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , however , other possibilities have been also studied @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we use random sequential updating , i.e. in each simulation step one of the @xmath0 customers ( denoted by an asterisk `` @xmath3 '' in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) in the square lattice is selected randomly and then together with his / her three neighbors  right , lower right and lower ",
    "forms a panel .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    the first rule we impose on the system is the following . if all four individuals in a panel support the same product ( the sum of spins @xmath4 is equal to four ) they will convince all eight of their nearest neighbors resulting in changing their orientation in the direction of the spins in the panel , see fig .",
    "1 . if one of the spins in the panel has the opposite orientation to the other three spins then the neighbors change their orientation to the orientation of the majority with probability @xmath5 . in the case",
    "when there is no majority , i.e. two spins in the panel are up and two are down , none of the neighboring spins are convinced by the panel .",
    "the above rule is a modification of rule ia of a two - dimensional sznajd model introduced in @xcite .",
    "stauffer et .",
    "al . assumed that a panel convinces its neighbors only if all four spins in the panel have the same direction .",
    "in all simulations we took initially @xmath6 of up - spins and @xmath7 of down - spins randomly distributed on the @xmath0 lattice .",
    "this corresponds to a situation when the initial concentration of customers of product a is @xmath6 .",
    "if the above rule was the only one imposed on the market then a phase transition would be observed : for @xmath8 , after some relaxation time , the steady state with all down - spins ( product b conquers the market ) would be reached , whereas @xmath9 would lead to an all up - spin state ( product a conquers the market ) . in case of @xmath10 each steady state",
    "is reached with probability @xmath11 .",
    "this is in accordance with the results of stauffer et .",
    "@xcite , which were obtained for a `` weaker '' rule .",
    "now we are in the position to introduce advertising into our model .",
    "suppose that the concentration @xmath6 of buyers of product a ( @xmath1 ) is less than 0.5 .",
    "the question that immediately pops up is : `` how strong should the advertising of product a be to conquer the market ? '' in the language of our model `` conquering the market by product a '' is equivalent to reaching a ferromagnetic steady state with all up - spins .    to answer this question we introduce a kind of an external field @xmath12 $ ] , which may be treated as a measure of the level of advertising in the market ( see also @xcite where advertising was introduced in a similar way ) .",
    "we assume that if a customer is not convinced by its neighbors he / she will be more responsive to advertising and with probability @xmath13 will choose product a ( @xmath1 ) , see fig .",
    "2 . note that the introduction of the advertising rule does not change the steady states , i.e. the system always reaches a ferromagnetic steady state ( all up - spins or all down - spins ) .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    \\(c ) ( d )",
    "to investigate our model we performed standard monte carlo simulations with random sequential updating .",
    "we considered a square lattice of @xmath0 ising spins ( i.e. up - arrows or down - arrows ) with periodic boundary conditions . for most of the presented results",
    "@xmath14 , however , we performed simulations for @xmath15 as well .",
    "we were usually making averaging over @xmath16 samples , with the exception of the smallest lattice where we averaged over @xmath17 samples . in all simulations we took",
    "initially @xmath6 of up - spins and @xmath7 of down - spins randomly distributed on the lattice .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in figs .",
    "3 - 6 .    in figure 3",
    "we plotted the probability p(@xmath1 ) of reaching the final steady state with all up - spins as a function of the initial concentration @xmath6 and the level of advertising @xmath13 .",
    "two kinds of regime changes ( or phase transitions ) can be observed .",
    "firstly , for a given level of advertising @xmath13 there exists a `` critical '' value of the initial concentration @xmath18 of product a customers above which  with probability one  this product will conquer the market , i.e. the market will evolve to a steady state with all up - spins .",
    "secondly , for an initial concentration @xmath6 of product a customers there exists a `` critical '' level of advertising @xmath19 of this product above which  with probability one  product a will conquer the market .",
    "observe that there is an intermediate region in which the market evolves to the final up - spin state with probability @xmath20 , i.e. each of the two products has a possibility of conquering the market .",
    "for a very small level of advertising product a has no chance of winning and product b will always conquer the market , see fig .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in figure 4 we presented the relaxation time @xmath21 needed to reach a steady state as a function of the level of advertising @xmath13 for several initial concentrations @xmath6 of product a customers .",
    "for the level of advertising slightly below the `` critical '' value @xmath19 the system relaxes very slowly , i.e. customers have a problem to decide which of the two products they should choose . above the `` critical '' value @xmath19 the system reaches the all up - spin steady state much faster .",
    "this suggests that the level of advertising should be larger than @xmath19 in order to prevent the advertising counter - campaign .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath21 depends not only on the level of advertising @xmath13 but also on the initial concentration @xmath6 of product a customers .",
    "this is presented in fig .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the critical value of advertising @xmath19 as well as the size of the intermediate region depends clearly on lattice size .",
    "the larger the system the lower is the `` critical '' level @xmath19 above which product a conquers the whole market and the steeper is the regime change . for an infinite size lattice we may expect that there is no intermediate region  below @xmath22 product b conquers the market with probability one and above @xmath22 product a conquers the market with probability one .",
    "moreover , the `` critical '' level can be approximated .",
    "for example , @xmath23 for the initial concentration of product a customers @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "6 . for other values of @xmath6 similar behavior is observed .",
    "in this paper we were studying the following situation : initially concentration of product a customers is @xmath6 and concentration of product b customers is @xmath7 .",
    "the choice a customer makes ( between two products sold in a duopoly market ) is influenced by the opinion of his / her neighbors and advertising .",
    "if the neighboring panel consists of four individuals buying one product , the customer will buy the same one . if three individuals in the neighboring panel favor one product , the customer will buy this product with probability @xmath5 .",
    "if the customer does not decide to follow the majority s opinion he / she will be responsive to advertising .",
    "the response of the customer to advertising ( in this model only product a is being advertised ) is measured by the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , the stronger the advertising , i.e. the higher the level @xmath13 , the larger is the probability that product a will conquer the market .",
    "however , there exists a `` critical '' level of advertising @xmath19 above which product a will conquer the market with probability one .",
    "this suggests that in case when the manufacturer of product b does not react to advertising in a certain , limited amount of time it is not efficient for the seller of product a to make the advertising campaign more intense .    in real world oligopoly markets ,",
    "innovation in terms of advertising and product introduction has been critical in keeping the brand image contemporary .",
    "however , the opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through such actions is limited in many markets because of the ease with which competitors can replicate the strategy @xcite .",
    "in our model we have found that above the `` critical '' value @xmath19 the relaxation of the system is rather fast preventing an advertising counter - campaign . on the contrary , if the level of advertising is close , but lower than @xmath19 the customers need much longer times to make a final choice between the two products , which makes the advertising campaign more costly and less efficient .",
    "we also have found that in larger systems the advertising level needed to conquer the market is smaller , which is in agreement with the results obtained by schulze @xcite .    naturally , calibrating the model to market data and finding the `` critical '' level of advertising is a story of its own .",
    "our future research will be devoted to this subject .",
