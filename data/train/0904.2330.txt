    "in the last decades spacetimes have been organized according to their causality properties in the so - called _ causal ladder of spacetimes_. this ladder is a hierarchy of conformally invariant properties whose study started at the end of the 60 s through the works of carter , geroch , hawking , kronheimer , penrose , seifert , woodhouse and others , who in those years established the main levels ( for an introduction see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important causality condition is stable causality .",
    "a spacetime is stably causal if the light cones can be widened all over the spacetime without introducing closed causal curves . for these spacetimes causality is stable under small perturbations of the metric .",
    "this paper investigates what happens if this condition is slightly relaxed .",
    "this is done in two natural and complementary directions . in one case",
    "we ask what happens if the enlargment is done only outside a compact set , namely in a neighborhood of infinity . in the other",
    "we ask what happens if the enlargements have finite extension , that is , if the widening of the light cones is done in the interior of a generic compact set .    concerning the former possibility we prove in section [ sec_outside ] that given a non - total imprisoning spacetime , if it is possible to widen the light cones outside a compact set without spoiling causality , then the spacetime is stably causal ( theorem [ outlight ] ) . in order to prove this result we introduce a new relation on @xmath0 whose antisymmetry is tightly connected to our operation on light cones near infinity .",
    "the proof uses the equivalence between @xmath3-causality @xcite and stable causality recently proved in @xcite .    concerning the latter possibility we study more in deep _",
    "compact stable causality _ , a new causality level introduced in @xcite which has been central in order to prove the mentioned equivalence between @xmath3-causality and stable causality or the fact that chronological spacetimes without lightlike lines are stably causal @xcite .",
    "a spacetime is compactly stably causal if it is causal and , roughly speaking , it is possible to open the light cones over any chosen compact set while preserving causality .",
    "this means that causality is stable under sufficiently small variations of the metric which are limited in extension .",
    "the definition of compact stable causality is suggested by variational calculus .",
    "here it is customary to consider metric variations @xmath4 with compact support of the einstein - hilbert action in order to get the einstein equations . if the spacetime is compactly stably causal , at least for sufficiently small variations , the corresponding varied spacetimes are all causal .",
    "it is interesting to note that to that end the original spacetime need not be stably causal as stable causality differs from compact stable causality @xcite .",
    "many causality conditions are traced back to antisymmetry conditions on causality relations so that the relationship between the different causality requirements becomes trivial @xcite and related to the inclusion of sets on @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , seifert introduced @xcite the relation @xmath6 and proved its transitivity and closure .",
    "he also argued that @xmath7 is antisymmetric if and only if the spacetime is stably causal ( for a rigorous proof see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.12 ) ) .",
    "it must be recalled here that the usual causal relation @xmath8 although transitive is not closed , a fact which explains why @xmath9 is particularly interesting .",
    "about twelve years ago , sorkin and woolgar reconsidered the properties of closure and transitivity but took a different approach .",
    "they defined the relation @xmath10 as the smallest closed and transitive relation containing @xmath11 , moreover , they defined a spacetime to be @xmath3-causal if the relation @xmath12 is antisymmetric @xcite .    since compact stable causality is similar to stable causality we expect to find a causal relation that plays for compact stable causality the same role that @xmath9 plays for stable causality . in section [ sec_csc ]",
    "we identify such new causality relation and prove that its antisymmetry is necessary and sufficient for the compact stable causality of the spacetime ( theorem [ jcs ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tabella ] we summarize the portion of the causal ladder below stable causality . in this figure whenever possible we provide the causal relation whose antisymmetry determines the level along with its closure and transitivity properties . for",
    "a unified framework showing all the causal relations that have appeared so far in the literature see @xcite .",
    ".the causal ladder and , for each level , the corresponding causal relation whose antisymmetry determines the causality condition .",
    "for the definition of @xmath13 see @xcite .",
    "the last two columns report on the transitivity and closure of the relation in the most general case ; they can be both _ yes _ for particular spacetimes .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabella ]    in section [ sec_topologies ] we study stable causality and compact stable causality in their relationship with the possible topologies on the space of lorentzian metrics .",
    "we first show which natural topologies lead to stable causality , then we follow a reasoning which argues that compact stable causality can not be obtained as a causal stability condition with respect to a reasonable topology on metrics .",
    "finally , we focus on geroch s interval topology and show that there is a neat topological connection between stable causality and compact stable causality which resides in the difference between the interior and the sequential interior of a set . indeed in the interval topology",
    "these two interior concepts differ as the topology is not frchet - urysohn . in theorems [ int ] and [ ints ]",
    "we prove that the stably causal metrics are those which stay in the interior of the set of chronological metrics , while the compactly stably causal metrics are those in the sequential interior .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for most of the conventions used in this work .",
    "in particular , we denote with @xmath14 a @xmath15 spacetime ( connected , time - oriented lorentzian manifold ) , @xmath16 of arbitrary dimension @xmath17 and signature @xmath18 . on @xmath5",
    "the usual product topology is defined .",
