    "solar surface convection on supergranular scales ( 96 mm wide by 20 mm deep ) was simulated by solving the conservation equations for mass , momentum and internal energy .",
    "spatial derivatives were evaluated using sixth order finite differences @xcite and the time advance was by a low memory , third order runge - kutta scheme @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed on a grid of @xmath1 giving a resolution of 96 km horizontally and 12 - 70 km vertically .",
    "f - plane rotation is included corresponding to a latitude of 30 .    a tabular equation of state which includes local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) ionization of the abundant elements as well as hydrogen molecule formation , was used to obtain the pressure and temperature as a function of log density and internal energy per unit mass .",
    "the radiative heating / cooling was obtained by solving the radiation transfer equation in both continua and lines using the feautrier method , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "the number of wavelengths for which the transfer equation is solved is drastically reduced by using a multi - group method whereby the opacity at each wavelength is placed into one of four bins according to its magnitude and the source function is binned the same way @xcite .",
    "horizontal boundary conditions are periodic , while top and bottom boundary conditions are open",
    ". the code is stabilized by diffusion in the momentum and energy equations , using a variable diffusivity that depends on the sound speed , the fluid velocity and the compression .",
    "the computational domain covers five orders of magnitude in pressure in the convective region , which is half the scale heights in the entire solar convection zone , even though the domain is only 10% of the zones geometric depth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atmosphere ] ) .",
    "this includes the hydrogen ionization layer and the first and most of the second helium ionization layers .",
    "a shear layer develops with a shear of 100 m / s across the 20 mm depth of the domain .",
    "20 mm deep simulation .",
    "this corresponds closely to the magnitude of the vorticity .",
    "figure courtesy bryan green , amti / nasa.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    convective motions are turbulent . descending vortex rings have typical mushroom shape and are connected back to surface with multiple twisted vortex tubes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vorticity ] ) .",
    "the horizontal scale of the convection increases from granule size at the surface to supergranule size near the bottom of the computational domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] ) .",
    "the horizontal velocity spectrum at the surface is a power law , with the magnitude of the velocity decreasing linearly with increasing size .",
    "there is a peak at granule scales and then a fall off at still smaller scales . about @xmath2 of the area",
    "is upflows and @xmath3 downflows nearly independent of depth .",
    "convection on the sun is driven primarily by radiative cooling in a thin boundary layer at the bottom of the photosphere where radiation begins to escape to space .",
    "radiative cooling produces low entropy , over dense fluid that is pulled down by gravity .",
    "there is also driving from the bottom of the convection zone where absorption of the radiative flux heats the fluid producing high entropy , under dense fluid .",
    "however , the entropy fluctuations near the surface are much much larger than those near the bottom of the convection zone , so most of the buoyant work occurs near the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drivedamp ] ) .",
    "the buoyancy driving is balanced by the divergence of the kinetic energy flux close to the surface and by dissipation at small scales through the remainder of the convection zone .",
    "the damping length is 4 pressure scale heights ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drivedamp ] ) .",
    "most of the energy in the cooler part of the convection zone close to the surface where hydrogen is partially ionized is carried by the internal ( ionization ) energy flux . at temperatures above 40,000 k ,",
    "this decreases and most of the energy is transported by the thermal energy flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxmix ] ) .",
    "the mass mixing length is the inverse of the logarithmic derivative of the unidirectional ( either up or down ) mass flux , @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : fluxmix ] shows that over most of the computational domain except right near the surface the mass mixing length is 1.8 pressure scale heights .",
    "this is an easy , unambiguous , calculation to make for other stars as well to determine the appropriate mixing length .",
    "sixteen hours of data are available as four hour averages , with two hour cadence , at steinr.msu.edu/@xmath0bob/96averages , as idl save files .",
    "the variables stored are the density , temperature , sound speed , three velocity components .",
    "in addition , the three velocity components at 200 km above mean continuum optical depth unity are available at 30 sec .",
    "a realistic simulation of supergranulation scale convection , covering half the scale heights in the solar convection zone can be used to evaluate local helioseismic inversion proceedures . it has also allowed us to determine the mass mixing length ( 1.8 @xmath5 ) , to show that most of the energy is transported as ionization energy below 40,000 k and as thermal energy above that temperature , and that the buoyancy driving is largest close to the surface , but significant throughout the simulated domain . in the interior ,",
    "this driving is balanced primarily by dissipation at small scales and the damping length is 4 @xmath5 .",
    "four hour averages with two hour candence of the density , temperature , sound speed , and three velocity components are available as idl save files .",
