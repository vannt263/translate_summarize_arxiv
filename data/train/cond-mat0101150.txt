    ". for the modes with higher azimuthal numbers @xmath2 , we have verified the picture of doublets with small splitting for large soliton radii @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum changes strongly with decreasing of @xmath0 : all modes with @xmath142 `` leave '' the region of the discrete spectrum , transforming to quasi  local modes . such modes could be observed experimentally by soliton magnetic resonance as was done for 1d solitons.@xcite    the influence of truly local modes is important for the scattering problem , leading to the bifurcations of the phase shift . as a result , when @xmath342 , the scattering picture is qualitatively the same as for the isotropic magnet which could be explained in the framework of a simple `` centrifugal model '' .",
    "there is one exception only , @xmath5 , where the local mode exists for every soliton radius .",
    "our investigations can be applied to the description of the eigenmodes of magnetic dots . in the present paper",
    "we develop the theory of local modes on the soliton background ; it could be a good guide for the study of the normal modes in the vortex  state magnetic dots .",
    "our theory is constructed for the soliton in the model ( [ eq : l ] ) , where the soliton is stabilized by the internal precession .",
    "it is clear that such a model can not guarantee the quantitative correspondence with the case of vortex  state magnetic dots , where the static soliton structure is stabilized by the magnetic  dipole interaction .",
    "we did not consider this type of interaction in the paper , as it is difficult to account for .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the main features of the problem studied above are generic .",
    "first of all , we expect the appearance of modes with anomalously small frequencies , e.g. the mode of the translational oscillations of the vortex centre .",
    "the non  zero frequency of this mode is caused by the interaction with the boundary only .",
    "secondly , doublets with @xmath343 , @xmath344 , should appear , when the radius of the vortex is rather large .",
    "we have used the results on the local modes for the most interesting case of the translational modes with @xmath172 to describe the soliton motion in the infinite  size magnet : it is possible to identify the soliton mass , which is finite due to the localized soliton structure .",
    "in contrast to both the belavin  polyakov soliton in the isotropic fm and the magnetic vortex in the easy  plane fm , the soliton motion in our case of the easy  axis fm is similar to the motion of a finite mass charged particle in a magnetic field .",
