    "the decay   @xmath59 ^ -$ ] has been the subject of much interest over the years . because of",
    "the transformation properties of the weak current under parity and g - parity , @xmath1 lepton decay to an odd number of pions is expected to occur exclusively through the axial vector current , ignoring isospin - violating effects .",
    "thus the @xmath8 system in this decay must have spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath60 or @xmath61 . as a result of this plus the purely weak interaction involved in @xmath1 decay ,",
    "such decays provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the axial vector hadronic weak current and the dynamics of axial vector meson decay .",
    "the @xmath59 ^ -$ ] decay is dominated by production of the poorly understood @xmath62 meson , which is believed to decay mainly via the lowest dimensional born ( mostly @xmath6-wave ) @xmath63 intermediate state .",
    "the world average values  @xcite for its mass and width are @xmath64 and 250600 mev respectively , determined primarily from @xmath1 decay .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the @xmath9 is not rigorous ",
    "many models have been proposed  @xcite to describe the line shape and resonant substructure , but none have provided an entirely satisfactory description of the data .",
    "additional experimental input is essential for a better understanding of this system .",
    "recent experimental studies of the @xmath65 decay have been carried out by the argus  @xcite , opal  @xcite and delphi  @xcite collaborations .",
    "analyses of earlier data such as that by isgur , morningstar and reader  @xcite had demonstrated the presence of @xmath66-wave @xmath63 production . with @xmath67 events , argus  @xcite measured the ratio of amplitudes at the nominal @xmath9 mass to be @xmath68 . in a sample of @xmath69 events , opal  @xcite found @xmath70 .",
    "another argus analysis  @xcite of @xmath71 lepton - tagged events considered many additional amplitudes .",
    "this analysis found a signal at the @xmath72 standard deviation ( @xmath73 ) level for the presence of an @xmath74 amplitude .",
    "neither argus nor opal found evidence of non - axial - vector contributions such as production of the @xmath75 @xmath76 which decays via @xmath63 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the decays @xmath77 ^ -$ ] and @xmath78 ^ -$ ] have been employed to constrain the @xmath1 neutrino mass  @xcite , through investigation of the endpoint in the invariant mass and energy spectra of the multi - pion system .",
    "notably , aleph  @xcite has obtained an upper limit of 18.2 mev at the 95@xmath16 confidence level ( cl ) on the @xmath79 mass , based on these decays .",
    "these analyses rely on an understanding of the hadronic dynamics .",
    "delphi @xcite , with @xmath80 events , has reported anomalous structure in @xmath65 in the context of a @xmath79 mass analysis . in that work , the dalitz plot distribution for events with very high @xmath8 mass ( @xmath81 ) is suggestive of enhanced @xmath66-wave @xmath63 production , while the @xmath8 mass spectrum shows an excess in this region relative to expectations from a single @xmath9 resonance .",
    "inclusion of a radial excitation ( an @xmath82 ) with a large @xmath66-wave coupling to @xmath83 provides an improved description of the delphi data , but weakens the @xmath79 mass limit .    in this article",
    ", we present results from a model - dependent analysis of the decay @xmath84 , based on data collected with the cleo  ii detector .",
    "we perform fits to models to characterize both the substructure as seen in dalitz plot and angular variables , as well as the @xmath9 resonance parameters as seen in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the @xmath24 channel has several advantages relative to the all - charged mode .",
    "first , the multihadronic and @xmath1 feed - across backgrounds are smaller .",
    "second , the @xmath24 mode may be better suited for discerning substructure involving isoscalar mesons because there is only one pairing of pions which can have @xmath85 , unlike in the all - charged case .",
    "this second point is particularly relevant in light of the argus result for @xmath86 production  @xcite and the recent observation of the decay @xmath87 by cleo  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that isoscalars may play a role in @xmath9 decay .",
    "the outline for the article is as follows . in section  [ s - evtsel ]",
    ", we describe the data sample and event selection .",
    "we describe the basic elements of the model used to characterize the @xmath17 data in section  [ s - model ] . in sections",
    "[ ss - substructure ] , [ ss - nutau ] and  [ ss - massfit ] , we describe the three analyses of the hadronic structure : ( 1 ) performing fits to the substructure based on dalitz plot and angular observables ; ( 2 ) extending these fits to determine the signed @xmath1 neutrino helicity ; and ( 3 ) performing fits to determine the resonant structure of the @xmath8 mass spectrum , making use of results from the substructure fits .",
    "we summarize the results and conclude in section  [ s - conclude ] .",
    "the analysis described here is based on 4.67 fb@xmath88 of @xmath3 collision data collected at center - of - mass energies @xmath89 of @xmath90 gev , corresponding to @xmath91 reactions of the type @xmath92 .",
    "these data were recorded at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) with the cleo  ii detector  @xcite between 1990 and 1995 . charged particle tracking in cleo  ii consists of a cylindrical six - layer straw tube array surrounding a beam pipe of radius 3.2  cm that encloses the @xmath3 interaction point ( ip ) , followed by two co - axial cylindrical drift chambers of 10 and 51 sense wire layers respectively .",
    "barrel ( @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the polar angle relative to the beam axis ) and end cap scintillation counters used for triggering and time - of - flight measurements surround the tracking chambers . for electromagnetic calorimetry , 7800 csi(tl ) crystals",
    "are arrayed in projective ( toward the ip ) and axial geometries in barrel and end cap sections respectively .",
    "the barrel crystals present 16 radiation lengths to photons originating from the ip .",
    "identification of @xmath2 decays relies heavily on the segmentation and energy resolution of the calorimeter for reconstruction of the @xmath95 s .",
    "the central portion of the barrel calorimeter ( @xmath96 ) achieves energy and angular resolutions of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with @xmath99 in gev , for electromagnetic showers .",
    "the angular resolution ensures that the two clusters of energy deposited by the photons from a @xmath95 decay are resolved over the range of @xmath95 energies typical of the @xmath1 decay mode studied here .",
    "the detector elements described above are immersed in a 1.5 tesla magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid surrounding the calorimeter .",
    "muon identification is accomplished with proportional tubes embedded in the flux return steel at depths representing 3 , 5 and 7 interaction lengths of total material penetration at normal incidence .      to identify events as @xmath100 candidates we require the decay of the @xmath101 ( denoted as the ` tagging ' decay ) that is recoiling against our signal @xmath102 decay to be classified as @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , or @xmath106 .",
    "thus , we select events containing two oppositely charged barrel tracks separated in angle by at least @xmath107 . to reject backgrounds from bhabha scattering and two - photon interactions we require track momenta to be between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "clusters of energy deposition in the central region of the calorimeter ( @xmath96 ) that are not matched with a charged track projection are paired to form @xmath95 candidates .",
    "these showers must have energies greater than 50  mev , and the invariant mass of the photon - pair must lie within @xmath110 of the @xmath95 mass where @xmath73 varies between @xmath111 mev .",
    "those @xmath95 candidates with energy above @xmath112 after application of a @xmath95 mass constraint are associated with any track within @xmath107 .",
    "a @xmath24 candidate is formed from a track which has two associated @xmath95 candidates as defined above . if more than one combination of @xmath95 candidates can be assigned to a given track , only one combination is chosen : namely , that for which the largest unused barrel photon - like cluster in the @xmath24 hemisphere has the least energy .",
    "a cluster is defined to be photon - like if it satisfies a @xmath113 confidence level cut on the transverse shower profile and lies at least 30  cm away from the nearest track projection . as mentioned earlier , to reject background from multihadronic ( @xmath114 ) events ,",
    "the tag system recoiling against the @xmath24 candidate must be consistent with @xmath1 decay to neutrino(s ) plus @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 or @xmath118 ( denoted as @xmath119 ) .",
    "the recoiling track is identified as an electron if its calorimeter energy to track momentum ratio satisfies @xmath120 and if its specific ionization in the main drift chamber is not less than @xmath121 below the value expected for electrons .",
    "it is classified as a muon if the track has penetrated to at least the innermost layer of muon chambers at 3 interaction lengths .",
    "if not identified as an @xmath122 or a @xmath123 , then if the track is accompanied by a third @xmath95 of energy @xmath124 which lies closer to it than to the @xmath125 system , the track-@xmath95 combination is classified as a @xmath126 tag .",
    "the invariant mass of this system must be between 0.55 and 1.20 gev .",
    "if not identified as an @xmath122 , @xmath123 , or @xmath126 tag , the recoil track is identified as a single @xmath127 tag . to ensure that these classifications are consistent with expectations from @xmath1 decay ,",
    "events are vetoed if any unused photon - like cluster with @xmath128 has energy greater than 200 mev , or if any unmatched non - photon - like cluster has energy above 500 mev .",
    "the missing momentum as determined using the @xmath125 and tagging systems must point into a high - acceptance region of the detector ( @xmath129 ) , and must have a component transverse to the beam of at least @xmath112 .",
    "after all cuts , the remaining sample consists of 51,136 events .",

    "in the @xmath132 signal region there are 36710 events , of which 17234 are tagged by leptonic decays of the recoiling @xmath1 .",

    "the high mass events are essentially absent from the lepton - tagged events , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3pi](d ) .",
    "for determination of detection efficiency for our signal decay as well as for backgrounds from other @xmath1 decay modes , we rely on a sample of monte carlo @xmath92 events with equivalent luminosity approximately three times that of the data .",

    "we have tuned the @xmath9 mass and width to yield a @xmath8 mass spectrum that roughly matches that seen in our data in the all - charged mode . although the data and mc @xmath8 mass spectra show reasonable agreement on average ( see fig .  [",
