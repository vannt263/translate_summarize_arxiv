    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in na@xmath8coo@xmath9h@xmath10o ( ref .  ) has renewed interest in layered cobaltates .",
    "these compounds have been extensively studied in the past for their large thermoelectric power .",
    "but the novel hydrated material , the first to show superconductivity , calls for a new look at their electronic properties .",
    "the parent compound na@xmath8coo@xmath10 has a hexagonal structure ( space group  194 ; p6@xmath11/_mmc _ ) consisting of alternating na- and coo@xmath10-layers stacked along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "the superconducting compound is obtained by the hydration of the parent compound whose main structural effect is the dramatic increase ( about a factor of two ) of the co - co inter - planar distance upon intercalation of ice - like sheets . the critical temperature @xmath13 is observed to be weakly dependent on na doping , with a maximum at @xmath14  k for @xmath15.@xcite    the strong anisotropy of the resistivity between the in - plane and the out - of - plane directions reported in these compounds indicates quasi two - dimensional electronic properties  @xcite and underlines the important role played by the co - o planes , in particular for superconductivity .",
    "the co - o planes form a spin frustrated triangular lattice of edge sharing coo@xmath16 octahedra .",
    "this strongly differs from the high-@xmath13 cuprates , where the cu - o planes are arranged in a square lattice of corner sharing oxygen octahedra .",
    "furthermore in cobaltates , the co valency is supposedly mixed between 4 + ( @xmath17 ) and 3 + ( @xmath18 ) depending on the na content @xmath19 , but the exact valent state of co is ill - defined : early works have indicated that the average co valency @xmath20 in the hydrated compound , as estimated from chemical titration , departs from the ( @xmath21 ) value expected from charge neutrality.@xcite the difference has been attributed to the presence of h@xmath11o@xmath22 ions in the na layers in the hydrated compound . in contrast , recent nuclear magnetic resonance data have showed that the co valence state is insensitive to hydration and only depends on the na content.@xcite a statement confirmed lately by powder neutron diffraction.@xcite    the indeterminate co valency in these materials reveals the difficulty to properly characterize the co @xmath7 states and their hybridization with the neighboring atoms . in the presence of the crystal electric - field in the octahedral environment ,",
    "the co @xmath5 level is split into a triply degenerated @xmath23 level and a doubly degenerated e@xmath24 level .",
    "the trigonal distortion of the coo@xmath16 octahedra lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath23 states to give one @xmath25 and two @xmath26 levels .",
    "a critical issue related to the co properties is the supposed existence of `` hole - pockets '' formed by these @xmath26 electrons at the fermi surface .",
    "the nesting conditions of these hole - pockets might be responsible for the onset of superconductivity in the hydrated material.@xcite this fermi surface topology was first proposed by density functional theory calculations in the local density approach ( lda )  @xcite and later confirmed in presence of dynamical coulomb correlations.@xcite but no such fermi surface topology has been observed in photoemission measurements.@xcite more recently , a calculation using a multi - orbital hubbard model in the hartree  fock and strong - coupling gutzwiller approximations showed the absence of hole - pockets in the fermi surface,@xcite in better agreement with experiments .",
    "one reason for the lack of consistency in the characterization of the co electronic properties lies in the sensitivity of the materials to humidity .",
    "surface - clean samples are difficult to prepare and specific studies of the bulk materials become necessary . in this paper",
    "we report on the electronic structure of both the hydrated and non - hydrated compounds , using complementary hard x - ray spectroscopies at the co @xmath4-edge , namely x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) .",
    "these high - energy probes are selective of the cobalt properties and provide bulk sensitive data .",
    "the experimental xas and rixs spectra will be compared to spectra obtained from first - principles calculations .",
    "the polarization - dependent xas spectra at the co @xmath4-edge ( @xmath27 transition ) are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : xas ] .",
    "the xas data are analyzed in the light of simulations based on the electronic density of states ( dos ) given by linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) calculations . in sec .  [",

    "the experiments were performed on single - crystals of na@xmath2coo@xmath28h@xmath1o ( ncoh ) and na@xmath0coo@xmath1 ( nco ) .",
    "the samples were prepared in the form of thin plates ( @xmath29  mm thick , @xmath30 for ncoh and @xmath31 for nco ) with the @xmath12-axis normal to the sample surface . the co @xmath4-edge xas spectra were acquired at the bm30 beamline at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( grenoble ) , in total fluorescence yield mode .",
    "details of the experimental setup have been described elsewhere.@xcite the incident energy is selected by a double crystal si(220 ) monochromator providing a total energy bandwidth of 450  mev .",
    "the beam was focused in the horizontal plane by the second monochromator crystal and in the vertical plane thanks to a rh - coated mirror , located downstream .",
    "the spot size was @xmath32 at the sample position .",
    "the samples were maintained between two kapton sheets .",
    "the measurements were carried out on both samples at 20  k using a liquid helium cryostat .",
    "the low - temperature mount was found to be efficient to retain ncoh ( nco ) hydrated ( non - hydrated).@xcite the spectra were measured in reflection geometry along two polarization directions by turning the sample holder by @xmath33 in the horizontal plane , starting from the polarization quasi perpendicular to @xmath34 ( in - plane polarization ) to parallel to the @xmath34 ( out - of - plane polarization ) . in our experimental geometry ,",

    "vertical lines indicate the peak energy positions.,width=7 ]    figure  1 shows the polarization dependence of the co @xmath4-edge xas spectra in ncoh ( lower panel ) and nco ( upper panel ) .",
    "the spectra are normalized to an edge jump of unity .",
    "the spectra exhibit a low - intensity feature ( labeled a in fig .",
    "1 ) in the pre - edge region at 7710.9  ev ( 7710.5  ev ) in ncoh ( nco ) followed by two pronounced peaks ( respectively labeled b and c ) at 7723.5  ev ( 7723.5  ev ) and 7731.0  ev ( 7730.4  ev ) in the vicinity of the absorption edge . when the polarization is turned from in - plane to out - of - plane , we notice a strong decrease in the intensity of the white line c in both samples , whereas peak b increases .",
    "the polarization dependence indicates that peak c is mainly associated to @xmath38 ( in - plane ) transitions , while peak b is related to @xmath39 ( out - of - plane ) transitions .",
    "no sign of co@xmath40co@xmath41 charge disproportionation is observed in the near - edge region .",
    "this contrasts with recent co @xmath6 photoemission measurements in nco and ncoh where well - separated features seemingly related to co@xmath40 and co@xmath41 have been observed.@xcite similarly to core - level photoemission , xas is a fast probe and should be able to distinguish between mixed valent states , whether static or dynamic order exists .",
    "however , the description of the ground state in terms of ionic configurations is not valid here because of covalency effects and multiple charge - transfer states have to be taken into account . in the xas final state ,",
    "the different configurations are split in energy because of the core - hole potential , but with additional intermixing .",
    "the xas spectral features are therefore not directly assignable to pure valent states .",
    "a similar observation was made at the co @xmath4-edge in the mixed - valent co@xmath40/co@xmath41 compounds la@xmath42sr@xmath8coo@xmath11  ( ref .  ) .",
    "the pre - edge region , on the contrary , is in principle more sensitive to the co valent states : in transition metal compounds , this spectral region mainly results from quadrupolar @xmath43 transitions , though with an admixture of dipolar character because of the trigonal distortion of the co octahedral site.@xcite a closer look shows that the pre - edge consists of two peaks in nco ( see vertical lines in the inset to fig .  [ fig : xas_new ] ) which we relate to the crystal - field splitting ( mainly of octahedral symmetry ) of the co @xmath5 states .",
    "the low - energy peak corresponds to transitions to the empty @xmath23 states , whereas the peak at higher energy is associated to transitions to the @xmath44 states .",
    "this energy splitting ( @xmath45 in nco ) is consistent with the values of the crystal - field parameter @xmath46 used in cluster model simulations of the co @xmath6 photoemission spectra of nco and ncoh ( estimated at 2.5  ev and 4.0  ev respectively for co@xmath40 and co@xmath41 ions ) .",
    "@xcite in ncoh , only the lowest @xmath5 split state is visible ( see vertical line in the inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : xas_new ] ) .",
    "we first note that the dipolar - like tail of the white line extends further towards lower energy in ncoh compared to nco , thus notably masking the high - energy crystal - field related structures .",
    "more importantly , the change in the pre - edge region in ncoh primarily reflects the variation of the co valency , induced by the different na doping level . in ncoh ,",
    "the number of holes in the @xmath23 states ( 0.65 ) is about a factor 2 larger than in nco  ( 0.3 ) . assuming that the strength of quadrupolar matrix elements does not depend on the sample ,",
    "this will lead to enhanced intensity of the lowest energy absorption peak corresponding to transitions to empty @xmath23 states in ncoh compared to nco , with respect to the @xmath47 peak , as observed in the spectra .",
    "the spectral changes in the pre - edge region therefore confirm the effects of na doping on the co valency .    in order to analyze further the changes in the xas spectra as a function of both polarization and na doping",
    ", the co @xmath4-edges were simulated from lmto band structure calculations .",
    "this one - electron approach is well suited here because the xas final states are mainly composed of co @xmath48 band - states .",
    "the monoelectronic approach is not expected to reproduce every feature of the absorption spectra but , as explained hereafter , provides valuable information on the co electronic properties in these materials .",
    "the calculations were performed using an lmto code  @xcite within the local density approximation starting from the known crystal structures for both compounds.@xcite we used the von  barth  hedin parametrization for the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite spin - polarization was neglected .",

    "separate band structure calculations were performed for each compound with na either in @xmath49 or @xmath50 sites . since the exact partitioning of na between the two sites is unknown , the calculated dos and absorption spectra were averaged assuming that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 sites are equally populated . to obtain the right na stoichiometry ( i.e. , 0.35 in ncoh and 0.7 in nco ) , the na concentration was adjusted artificially using the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the na atoms are replaced by `` virtual atoms '' defined by a pseudopotential taken as the average potential of the real atoms at the same site . in the calculations ,",

    "it can not be attributed to quadrupolar transitions since only the dipolar contributions are considered in the calculations . it should rather be understood as resulting from the hybridization between the co @xmath48 states with the co @xmath5 states through the interaction with the o @xmath6 ligand states . in both nco and ncoh simulated spectra ,",

    "the pre - edge intensity in the in - plane xas spectrum of ncoh will increase compared to nco .    in the calculated xas spectra it is important to disentangle the influence of the na sites from the impact of the na concentration and the hydration ( @xmath12-axis elongation ) effects .",

    "each spectrum is further projected onto the two polarization directions , i.e. , ( @xmath64 ) ( lower spectra ) and @xmath65 ( upper spectra ) . for a given @xmath69 ratio , the calculations for two different na sites ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) and two different na concentrations ( 0.35 , 0.7 ) are almost identical in the in - plane configuration ( especially at @xmath70 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the spectra in the out - of - plane configuration do show differences when substituting a na on site @xmath49 by one on site  @xmath50 .",
    "the largest changes are observed for @xmath71 , when interplane interactions are largest .",
    "similarly , the variation of the na concentration mostly affects the out - of - plane spectra obtained with na occupying the @xmath49 site .",
    "the highest sensitivity when na occupies site @xmath49 may be related to its location in the unit cell above the co atoms , while the off - centered na @xmath50 atoms are a much weaker perturbation to the co @xmath53 states .    to summarize , the elongation of the @xmath12-axis is the main modifying factor of the xas spectra , thus of the co electronic properties , while the na concentration and site - substitution has a less influence .",
    "this _ a posteriori _ justifies our starting hypothesis for the lmto calculations with na equally distributed in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 sites .",
    "the out - of plane spectra are observed to be highly sensitive to the structural change as expected from the quasi two - dimensional character of the co - o network .",

    "electron energy - loss spectroscopy or optical absorption provide means of measuring low - lying excited states .",
