    "if a significant second population at one distance  in this case sgr  were present , it might show up as a second bump or an asymmetry in the distribution , even if the fiducial does not precisely match the background population .",
    "detecting the sgr background feature would allow us to constrain any effect it has upon the isochrone fitting and measure any distance discrepancy between the sgr member clusters and the stellar tidal debris stream .",
    "for arp 2 , terzan 7 and terzan 8 , the number counts follow a gaussian distribution with no deviation larger than the poisson noise ( see figure [ f : magshift ] ) .",

    "given that the distance measures in table [ t : members ] suggest a significant distance discrepancy for at least terzan 7 , ( 2 ) is the more likely explanation .",
    "in the course of examining the cmds of the acs survey globular clusters , we identified five bulge cluster cmds that appear to contain a faint secondary stellar sequence parallel to and below the cluster main sequence ( figure [ f : sgrbgdem ] ) .",
    "this secondary sequence is too bright and red to represent the white dwarf sequence of the cluster and has the appearance of a diffuse main sequence . it is broader than the photometric uncertainties would indicate for a simple stellar population , which hints at a composite population . given that the suspect clusters lie in the foreground of the body and tidal stream of sgr , it is likely that this feature represents the diffuse sgr tidal stream in the background of these clusters .",
    "this sgr background feature has been hinted at before ( see , e.g. , mateo et al .",
    "1996 ) but has not been depicted as cleanly as shown in figure [ f : sgrbgdem ] .",
    "the deep and precise acs data delineate three magnitudes of this secondary sequence .",
    "this feature appears in all of the acs survey clusters that are relatively close ( within 11 degrees ) to the sgr core .",
    "the fortuitous alignment of the sgr background features with simple and well - measured foreground clusters  in combination with the consistent and precise photometry produced by our pipeline  provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure the distance of the sgr core and/or tidal stream along multiple lines of sight across the face of the dsph .",
    "while the foreground clusters generally have different abundances than typical sgr core stars , the stars of the foreground mss provide a useful first estimate of the relative distances to the suspected sgr features . using the fiducials from paper vii",
    ", we measured by eye the color - magnitude shifts needed to move each foreground cluster s fiducial to overlap the suspected sgr population .",
    "these relative measures confirm that the secondary sequences are at a distance consistent with that of the sgr core .",
    "we then refined these rough estimates by measuring the relative distance of each of the background features to each other .",
    "we first removed from each color - magnitude diagram those stars that lay within 0.1 magnitudes of the foreground clusters fiducial , as defined in paper vii .",
    "we then established ngc  6681 , which has the strongest sgr feature , as a template and overlayed the color - magnitude diagram of ngc  6624 , which has the second - strongest .",
    "we shifted the cmd of ngc  6624 in color - magnitude space by eye until the sgr feature of ngc  6624 overlapped that of ngc  6681 .",
    "the data from the two clusters were then combined and the cluster with the next - strongest feature overlayed and shifted .",
    "this process continued through all five of the bulge clusters with clean secondary sequences until color - magnitude shifts were established for the entire sample .",
    "this cmd shifting and adding enhances the sgr feature ( see figure [ f : enhance ] ) and allows to re - shift each cluster iteratively in the combined cmd to further refine the relative distance estimates .",
    "these relative measures were then calibrated to absolute distance by overlaying the isochrones fitted to the sgr population from paper iv .",
    "the m54/sgr field is a complex medley of populations .",

    "this trend could be critical to analysis of the sgr background features .",
    "the derived absolute distance of the sgr cmd features , as measured by comparison to the paper iv isochrones , is sensitive to which of these seven populations are included in the analysis .",
    "if we include all seven populations , the inferred distances would be many kpc farther than the distances measured for the sgr core clusters .",
    "however , including all seven populations is likely inappropriate for the background features , which all lie outside of the core of sgr ( defined as 3.7 - 3.9 degrees in m03 ) and are well way from the central m54 pointing .",
    "no study , from either the ground or hst , has found the youngest populations seen in the paper iv analysis beyond these innermost regions of sgr ; and none of the five background features has the bright blue syng population seen in the m54 field ( the brightest turnoff in figure 1 ) .",
    "the aforementioned spectroscopic studies of sgr s inner regions ( carretta et al . 2010b ; frinchaboy et al .",
    ", in prep ) would favor using the more metal - poor of sgr s seven populations .",
    "the frinchaboy et al .",
    "study , in particular , traces out the major axis of sgr into regions overlapping our survey .",
    "the metallicity distribution in their outer regions would be best matched by a combination of the sgr mpp population with the more metal poor sint populations ( those with [ fe / h ] of @xmath27 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "such a choice of isochrones would also be consistent with the approximately 0.2 dex drop in metallicity between the core and the tidal arms indicated by studies of the tidal arms ( lm10a ; alard et al .",

    "the uncertainty over which populations to use ( and the relative strengths of each ) introduces some uncertainty into our distance measures .",

    "would move the background features closer by another 0.14 magnitudes .",
    "however , neither of these changes would remove the readily apparent reddening difference between the foreground bulge cluster and background sgr feature , because the older populations are also more metal poor and therefore have a bluer ms .",

    "( 2001 ) and chou et al .",
    "we therefore find it unlikely that the difference in apparent foreground reddening is a mistaken analysis of a difference in stellar populations .",
    "a final explanation is that systematic errors in the models and synthetic ( or even empirical ) colors is masking itself as a difference in reddening , i.e. , that we are measuring a discrepancy in the isochrones rather than a discrepancy in the reddening .",
    "we find this unlikely , given the range of abundances in the foreground clusters ( -0.44 to -1.94 ) and the success the isochrones have had in reproducing the color - magnitude shapes of the full sample of clusters in paper ix .    in the end , however , our analysis is based on the measures of sgr features relative to each other , not to the foreground clusters .",
    "so while a problem in reddening or photometry may change the absolute values of our measurements , it will have no effect on the relative measures .",

    "we have made a minor adjustment to the models to center them at precisely @xmath38 and @xmath39 or 30 kpc ; although lm10a constrained their model to lie at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , numerical limitations of the @xmath0-body method caused their model sgr dsph to overshoot the correct position at the current epoch by @xmath40 ( corresponding to @xmath41 myr ) along its orbit . while this slight mismatch was unimportant for the analysis of lm10a ( which focused on the properties of the sgr tails at large angular separations from the dwarf ) , it is significant with respect to our present study of the sgr core .",

    "2003 ) predicts only 1 - 3 galactic halo stars in the cmd region from which we calculate @xmath31 .",

    "if the density dropoff in ngc  6652 is real , it would indicate that while the density profiles fit in m03 provide a sound broad description of sgr s density profile , the narrow field of acs is more susceptible to small variations in density , such as might be produced by isophotal twisting or a transition from the bound core of sgr to the unbound tidal stream ( the contours of ibata et al .",

    "far more extensive data will be needed to determine if the measured ngc  6652 field density of sgr ms stars is simply a statistical anomaly or photometric error ( albeit at the 7 @xmath44 level ) or an indication of a much more complex inner structure in sgr .",
    "comparing the sgr stellar densities to the @xmath0-body model shows a rough agreement .",

    "ngc  6681 , which has the highest density , would be near the bound core of sgr .",
    "the model does not explain the low density we measure for ngc  6652 .",
    "however , models with a greater variety of sgr core shapes ( e.g. , okas et al . 2010 ) may be better able to reproduce the observed sky densities .",
    "the @xmath0-body model of lm10a makes specific predictions about the relationship between sky position and line of sight distance for the disrupting sgr dwarf .",
    "in the model , emerging debris in the trailing arm ( positive @xmath12 values ) is slightly more distant that emerging debris in the leading arm ( negative @xmath12 ) .",

    "the leading stream falls inside the orbital path and the angular momentum moves it ahead of sgr along the orbit .",

    "the distance-@xmath12 trend reverses because of the shape of sgr s orbit ( the green line in figure [ f : sgrsim ] ) .",
    "the dsph is moving away from the sun , so leading debris will be further away while trailing debris will be closer . according to the model , this orbital shape will result in a difference in line of sight distances of approximately 4 kpc over the @xmath1912 degree span of our survey .",
    "however , the combination of the two dynamical effects  mass loss mechanics and orbital path  should combine to make the distance to sgr roughly constant over the @xmath12 interval covered by our data , with perhaps a slight overall trend of increasing distance with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "our points are close to the prediction of the model and the sense of the distance measures  either flat or slightly increasing distance with decreasing @xmath12  is similar to that of the unbound debris . however , with the exception of terzan 7 , the bottom panel of figure [ f : sgrsim ] shows that our distance measures are consistently farther than predicted for a disrupting sgr core at 28 kpc .",
    "increasing the sgr distance to 30 kpc , however , ( middle panel of figure [ f : sgrsim ] ) brings the distance measures into remarkably improved agreement with the model .",
    "we explore the possibility of a larger sgr distance further in  4.4 and 4.5 .",
    "bellazzini et al . ( 2008 , b08 ) have argued , from measurements of velocity dispersion profiles , that m54 is not the core of sgr but may have formed independently and plunged to the core of sagittarius due to dynamical friction .",
    "their dynamical simulations indicate that this process would take only a few gyr . however , if m54 is liberated from its assumed status as the sagittarius core , it need not necessarily be at the same distance along the line of site , as is assumed by b08 .    if m54 were not precisely in the center of sgr but were situated a kpc or two in front of or in back of the nucleus , then the sgr distance in paper iv would be accurate for m54 itself because that distance was measured from the dominant m54 metal - poor main sequence",
    ". however , the stellar populations within the parent dsph might be at a different distance . in paper iv , we tied sgr s distance to that of m54 because m54 dominates the main sequence regions of the cmd and we could not discern a distance discrepancy between the two . the possibility of a distance difference between m54 and sgr was not addressed .",
    "our new distance measures allow an independent constraint on the distance to sgr in the absence of stars from the overlapping globular cluster .",
    "as noted above , the most striking aspect of figure [ f : sgrsim ] is that two of the three sgr canonical clusters and all five of the sgr main sequence features lie at the most distant edge of lm10a s theoretical sgr stream for a distance of 28 kpc . increasing the input model sgr distance to 30",
    "kpc produces better agreement between the measured distances and the @xmath0-body model .",
    "arp 2 , terzan 8 and all five background features would be comfortably within the sgr stream at the longer distance ( although terzan 7 would be more discrepant ) . in this scenario",
    ", m54 would lie at the near edge of the dsph core , possibly still within the bound portions of the satellite but displaced from the center .",
    "could this apparent distance discrepancy be produced by something other than a genuine distance discrepancy between the sgr core and m54 ?",
    "we consider five potential phenomena that could mimic a genuine discrepancy in distance between sgr and m54 :    \\(1 ) observational error could produce an offset in the photometry that disguises itself as an apparent offset in distance .",
    "however , such a systematic error is unlikely .",
    "the chief advantage of the acs survey is that the data are uniform , taken with the same instrument and filters over a short span of time and reduced and processed through an identical pipeline . for the distance difference to be a result of observational error",
    ", there would have to be a previously undetected change in the hst - acs camera that affects all of the cluster fields _ except _ those of m54 and terzan 7 ( or , alternately , _ just _ those of m54 and terzan 7 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) we could be systematically over - estimating the distance of the sgr main sequence features because of the small number of sgr stars .",
    "perhaps some of the brighter sgr populations are too sparse to be clearly detected in the background features , causing us to shift the group of three isochrones , including the brighter ones , too faint in an effort to fit the data",
    ". however , ngc  6681 , which has the strongest sgr background signal , yields one of the most distant measures at @xmath47=17.42 , a @xmath48 discrepancy from the paper iv sgr distance ( based on our estimate of 0.05 mag uncertainty in the relative distance ) .",
    "\\(3 ) related to ( 2 ) is the possibility that we have over - estimated the reddening , as discussed in ",
    "[ s : background ] .",
    "however , as noted in that section , all of our comparisons are relative .",
    "moreover , ngc  6681 , which has the strongest sgr background signal , has an identical color shift to the central sgr / m54 field but a large ( 3 @xmath44 ) magnitude shift .",
    "these discrepancies can not be accounted for by errors in the assumed foreground reddening .",
    "\\(4 ) as noted above , our distance measures are sensitive to the assumed sgr stellar populations used to constrain the distance to the background features .",
    "however , restoring the younger populations to our isochrones would result in a _ longer _ distance for the cmd background features . removing the intermediate age populations results in shorter distances for the sgr background features .",
    "however , this results in a background sgr population that is inconsistent with photometric measures of more dense areas of sgr ( see , e.g. , pryor et al .",
    "2010 ) as well as spectroscopic surveys ( frinchaboy et al . , in prep ) that definitively show an intermediate population consistent with our choice of isochrones .",
    "moreover , the sgr feature in ngc  6681 is very close to the sgr core , perhaps within the bound remnant .",
    "it is unlikely that the background sgr material in this field is much more metal - poor and/or older than the sgr debris in the m54 field , given the abundances in the extended sgr core and stream measured by alard et al .",

    "( 2010 ) and frinchaboy et al ( in prep ) .",
    "\\(5 ) finally , the notion that we can measure the distance of the sgr core from measurements taken along the extended profile of sgr assumes that we can use the lm10a model to compare the sgr core distance to those measure along its tidal arms .",
    "it is remotely possible that a sgr core at the same distance as m54 could have extended tidal arms that are at the distances measured in the other eight fields due to a different shape .",
    "however , this too is unlikely .",
    "it is difficult to configure sgr s geometry so that _ both _ tidal arms are further away than the sgr core .    in the end , we conclude that the most likely explanation for the distance discrepancy between the sgr debris and m54 is that m54 is , in fact , in front of the main body of sgr .",
    "the mean distance modulus of the sgr clusters is 17.22 , shorter than the paper iv distance of 17.27 , mostly because of the short distance we measure for terzan 7 .",
    "dropping terzan 7 sets the mean distance modulus to 17.30 .",
    "the cmd background features have a mean distance of 17.37 and a dispersion of 0.04 , indicating a sgr distance modulus between 17.32 and 17.42 ( assuming a 0.05 magnitude relative uncertainty ) , corresponding to a linear distance of 29 - 30 kpc .    increasing the sgr distance , however , might change the assumed sgr populations .",
    "the sgr populations that we use to measure the distance of the background main sequence features were constrained in paper iv based on the assumption that they were at the same distance as m54 .",
    "if the sgr populations were more distant , however , this would alter the ages and metallicities of the sgr populations described in paper iv , which were based on the bluer mstos and rgbs of sgr , rather than the m54-dominated ms .",
    "this could , in turn , change the distances measured for the background features from isochrone fitting .",
    "however , our analysis indicates that these changes to the measured sgr stellar populations would be minor .",
    "if we give sgr a line - of - distance distance modulus of @xmath47=17.39 , we could easily align the intermediate isochrones with the observed sgr cmd features by decreasing their ages by 0.5 - 1 gyr and perhaps increasing their abundances by to 0.1 dex ( see figure [ f : sgrmove ] ) .",
    "this would have little effect on the cmd background feature distances . although the stellar population analysis of paper iv was based on the msto and rgb , the distances in this paper were measured based solely on main sequence fitting .",
    "altering the metallicity of the intermediate age populations by 0.1 dex would make the rgb / msto consistent with the greater distance modulus but not significantly change the main sequence luminosity more than our uncertainties .",
    "the resultant distance measures would therefore be similar to those derived above .",
    "we can not determine what effects the distance modulus change would have on the sgr mpp since the characteristics population were assumed in paper iv , not fit , because of the dominance of the m54 mpp in the cmd .",
    "as for the younger populations characterized in paper iv , our assessment of them would be little affected by an increase in distance .",
    "the youngest population ( svyng ) is diffuse and its age / metallicity more uncertain than the distance scale .",
    "the syng population is better defined in the cmd .",
    "however , the increase in distance would almost exactly be cancelled by a change in isochrone calibration .",
    "paper iv used semi - empirical colors for the isochrones while this paper uses synthetic colors . while the different color transformations produce similar isochrones for the older populations , there is some disagreement as to the color and magnitudes of the younger populations .",
    "given that the young populations are so far unconstrained by spectroscopic metallicities , their ages and metallicities are not well - defined .",
    "nevertheless , the syng population described in paper iv still accurately reproduces the overall shape and color of the syng msto , as shown in figure [ f : sgrmove ] .",
    "of course , neither svyng nor syng are seen in the sgr main sequence features , so they would not impact the distance measures in the bulge cluster fields .    based on our present information",
    ", it is possible that m54 is not at the center of sgr .",
    "confirming or refuting this will require better constraints on sgr s stellar populations outside of the central m54 field and/or more distance measures along the face of the dsph .",
    "one final problem related to using a longer distance for sgr is the status of the globular cluster terzan 7 .",
    "its distance of 25.4 kpc would be consistent with the canonical sgr distance used by previous investigations .",
    "however , it would be significantly ( 6 @xmath44 , assuming @xmath49 ) different from the distance we measure for the other sgr globular clusters ( 28.5 kpc ) and even more discrepant ( 7 - 9 @xmath44 ) from the longer distance we argue to hold for the sgr main body .    at first blush , it seems unlikely that terzan 7 is only aligned with the sgr dsph by chance .",
    "terzan 7 s age and metallicity are typical of the  young halo \" objects traditionally associated with dsph galaxies .",
    "terzan 7 and pal 12 are the only globular clusters known to lack the na - o anticorrelation that is ubiquitous in galactic globular clusters ( carreta et al",
    ". 2010a ) .",
    "using previous distance measures , lm10b concluded that terzan 7 was unlikely to be aligned by chance based on the cluster s location , radial velocity and distance .",
    "however , we decided to re - examine the latter point in light of our new distance estimates .    to determine the status of terzan 7 , we re - ran the lm10a model and checked the status of all the sgr member clusters for varying sgr distances .",
    "if sgr is at a distance of 28 kpc , arp 2 , terzan 7 and terzan 8 all can be matched with individual test particles in the sgr simulation . in the simulation ,",
    "the clusters have come unbound on the last pericenter ( 0.1 gyr ago ) and will move much further ( 70 - 110 degrees ) downstream before the next pericenter .",
    "m54 , of course , is in the center of sgr in this simulation    increasing the sgr distance to 30 kpc and placing m54 2 kpc in the foreground changes this picture somewhat .",
    "all four clusters match test particles within the sgr debris , but terzan 7 requires a much more generous search tolerance . using the p3 statistic from lm10b , we find that terzan 7 s p3 value increases from 0.043 to 0.12 ( compared to .001 for terzan 8 and arp 2 ) .",
    "given that @xmath50 such false - positives expected at the level p3 @xmath51% , it seems possible that terzan 7 could be a chance alignment .",
    "given this now more troubling statistic , measuring an absolute proper motion for terzan 7 is critical to affirming its status as a member of sgr . if terzan 7 is indeed a member , the distance discrepancy hints that terzan 7 has a different dynamical history than the other classical sgr member clusters .    as for m54",
    ", the simulation with the cluster in front of the dsph indicates that m54 should sink to the center of sgr via dynamical friction in approximately 3 gyr if the dsph has a cuspy core consistent with the analysis of b08 .",
    "this would seem to argue against the idea that m54 is 1 - 2 kpc in front of the dsph .",
    "however , if we assume a shallower density profile for sgr , m54 may stall its descent near the core radius of @xmath52 kpc ( m03 ) . given the similarity between this distance and our measured m54-sgr distance ( 2 kpc ) this",
    "may already have happened , although it would seem a remarkable coincidence that m54 has stalled precisely along our line of sight to sgr .",
    "our study of the sagittarius system using acs - wfc photometry has identified parts of the sgr core and debris trail in the background of five unrelated bulge globular clusters . assuming this background population to be consistent with the intermediate - age and old populations identified in paper iv , we derive distances to these features .",
    "the combination of five lines of sight to the sgr main body as well as four sgr member clusters allows nine precise and independent distance measures to the center of the sgr system .",
    "the combined distances are roughly consistent with the sgr distance measured in paper iv for m54 ( @xmath47=17.27 ; @xmath53=28.4 kpc ) , which is slightly longer than the estimates based on the rgb tip ( 17.10 ; monaco et al .",
    "2004 ) and rr lyrae stars ( 17.19 ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ; kunder & chaboyer 2009 ) .",
    "however , the cmd background sequences are , in fact , slightly more distant than the paper iv estimate .",
    "this may indicate that m54  which is usually used as a proxy for measuring the distance to sgr  lies in the foreground of the dwarf and that the true distance to sgr is @xmath52 kpc larger than that derived in paper iv .",
    "an increased sgr distance would be more consistent with the distances we measure for both the background features and two of the other sgr core globular clusters ( arp 2 and terzan 8) . if m54 were 2 kpc closer along the line of sight , its distance would still be consistent with the  sgr \" distance measures made from rr lyrae and rgb tip stars , measures that would be dominated by the m54 cluster .",
    "dynamical models , both from b08 and lm10a , indicate that m54 would sink to the center of sgr from dynamical friction in 2 - 3 gyr .",
    "if it has not done so , this may indicate a shallower density profile for sgr or that m54 has a different dynamical history than assumed .",
    "terzan 7 is several kpc closer to us than the main body of sgr and the other core sgr clusters .",
    "this raises the possibility that terzan 7 may not be part of sgr or has a different dynamical history than that of the other globular clusters .",
    "precise absolute proper motions for the cluster would determine which of these scenarios is more likely by tracing the orbit of terzan 7 .",
    "we find that the stellar densities for the sgr features are consistent with the elongated sgr shape described in m03 , which the exception of an unusually low density in the sgr background feature of ngc  6652 , which we can not explain .",
    "the relative distance measures across the face of sgr are also broadly consistent with expectations from current models of the sgr tidal disruption ( see , e.g. , lm10a ) as long as the longer distance scale ( 30 kpc ) for the sgr system is adopted .",
    "our initial study indicates a substantial width to the emerging sgr tidal tail , which confirms the higher sgr mass used in the lm10a model .    to aid the reader in visualizing the relative three - dimensional orientation that our data imply for sgr s inner regions ,",

    "<S> we use observations from the _ hubble space telescope _ _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( _ hst_/acs ) study of galactic globular clusters to investigate the spatial distribution of the inner regions of the disrupting sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we combine previously published analyses of four sgr member clusters located near or in the sgr core ( m54 , arp 2 , terzan 7 and terzan 8) with a new analysis of diffuse sgr material identified in the background of five low - latitude galactic bulge clusters ( ngc  6624 , 6637 , 6652 , 6681 and 6809 ) observed as part of the acs survey . by comparing the bulge cluster cmds to our previous analysis of the m54/sgr core , we estimate distances to these background features . </S>",
    "<S> the combined data from four sgr member clusters and five sgr background features provides nine independent measures of the sgr distance and , as a group , provide uniformly measured and calibrated probes of different parts of the inner regions of sgr spanning twenty degrees over the face of the disrupting dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us , for the first time , to constrain the three dimensional orientation of sgr s disrupting core and globular cluster system and compare that orientation to the predictions of an @xmath0-body model of tidal disruption . </S>",
    "<S> the density and distance of sgr debris is consistent with models that favor a relatively high sgr core mass and a slightly greater distance ( 28 - 30 kpc , with a mean of 29.4 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also suggests that m54 is in the foreground of sgr by @xmath1 kpc , projected on the center of the sgr dsph . </S>",
    "<S> while this would imply a remarkable alignment of the cluster and the sgr nucleus along the line of sight , we can not identify any systematic effect in our analysis that would falsely create the measured 2 kpc separation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the cluster terzan 7 has the most discrepant distance ( 25 kpc ) among the four sgr core clusters , which may suggest a different dynamical history than the other sgr core clusters . </S>"
