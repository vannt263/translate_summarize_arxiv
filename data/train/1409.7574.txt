    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a phenomenally successful phenomenological theory whose last building block associated with the higgs sector has finally been detected @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson with a mass of @xmath5126 gev is made even more significant by the lack of discovery ( so far ) of any new particle associated with supersymmetry ( susy ) , technicolor , or any other beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenario which have been proposed as solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "this apparent failure of existing bsm models may simply be an indication that , while one of the approaches is actually correct , the corresponding model is not sophisticated enough to accurately represent nature , and that further refinements would eventually lead to a successful theory .",
    "another point of view may be that the higgs mass and the lack of new particles are pointing to the limitations of existing bsm paradigms such as susy and technicolor , and that new ideas to guide bsm model building should be rigorously searched for .",
    "since no stone should be left unturned , this search should include reassessments of old ideas as well .      in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the possibility of reviving the superconnection formalism first discussed in 1979 by neeman @xcite , fairlie @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "the original observation of neeman was that the @xmath6 gauge fields and the higgs doublet in the sm could be embedded into a single @xmath0 superconnection @xcite with the @xmath6 gauge fields constituting the even part of the superconnection and the higgs doublet @xmath7 constituting the odd part , to wit : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "this embedding predicts @xmath10 as well as the higgs quartic coupling , the latter leading to a prediction of the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "the leptons and quarks could also be embedded into irreducible representations of @xmath0 @xcite , thereby fixing their electroweak quantum numbers in a natural fashion .",
    "fairlie started from a 6-dimensional gauge - higgs unified theory reduced to four dimensions and arrived at a similar observation .",
    "subsequently , suggestions have been made to incorporate qcd into the formalism by extending the superalgebra to @xmath11 @xcite .    though the appearance of the @xmath0 superconnection suggested an underlying ` internal ' @xmath12 supersymmetry , gauging this supersymmetry to obtain the superconnection proved problematic as discussed in refs .",
    "for instance , the higgs doublet is a boson whereas an @xmath12 supersymmetry would demand the off - diagonal scalar components of the superconnection be fermionic with the wrong spin - statistics .",
    "interpreting these degrees of freedom as ghosts would render the model non - unitary , and though attempts have been made to deal with this problem @xcite the issue has never been completely resolved .",
    "it is also clear that the quarks and leptons placed in @xmath12 representations can not all be fermions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 supersymmetry must also be broken by hand to give the gauge boson kinetic terms the correct signs @xcite .",
    "due to these , and various other problems , interest in the approach waned .",
    "it was subsequently recognized , however , that the appearance of a superconnection does not necessarily require the involvement of the familiar boson@xmath13fermion supersymmetry .",
    "this development follows the 1990 paper of connes and lott @xcite who constructed a new description of the sm using the framework of noncommutative geometry ( ncg ) in which the higgs doublet appears as part of the yang - mills field ( i.e. connection ) in a spacetime with a modified geometry .",
    "the full yang - mills field in this approach was described by a superconnection , the off - diagonal elements of which were required to be bosonic .",
    "the ngc - superconnection approach to the sm was studied by many authors and a vast literature on the subject exists , _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite to give just a representative list . though these works differ from each other in detail , the basic premise is the same .",
    "the models are all of the kaluza - klein type in which the extra dimension is discrete and consists of only two points . in other words ,",
    "the model spacetime consists of two @xmath14 dimensional ` branes . ' in such a setup , the connection must be generalized to connect not just points within each brane , but also to bridge the gap between the two . if the left - handed fermions live on one brane and the right - handed fermions on the other , then the connections within each brane , _",
    "i.e. _ the even part of the superconnection , will involve the usual sm gauge fields which couple to fermions of that chirality .",
    "in contrast , the connection across the gap , _",
    "i.e. _ the odd part of the superconnection , connects fermions of opposite chirality and can be identified with the higgs doublet .    in this approach , both the even and odd parts of the superconnection are bosonic , the @xmath15-grading of the superalgebra resulting not from fermionic degrees of freedom but from the existence of the two ` branes ' ( on which the chirality @xmath16 provides the @xmath15 grading operator ) , and the definition of the generalized exterior derivative @xmath17 in the discrete direction . , the exterior derivative is intrinsically ` fermionic . ' ] that is , the superconnection emerges from the ` geometry ' of the discrete extra dimension .    in algebraic geometry ,",
    "the geometric properties of a manifold @xmath18 are studied via the algebraic properties of the commutative algebra of smooth functions @xmath19 defined on it .",
    "if this algebra is allowed to be noncommutative in general , one has a ncg @xcite . in the discrete extra dimension case ,",
    "one usually starts with the algebra @xmath20 , and the fermions on the branes are required to lie in representations of this algebra .",
    "gauge transformations correspond to the unitary inner automorphisms of the algebra , which in this case is @xmath21 .",
    "the exterior derivative @xmath17 is defined via @xmath22_s\\;,\\qquad \\alpha\\in\\mathcal{a}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23_s$ ] is the super - commutator , and the operator @xmath24 includes the usual exterior derivative acting on the @xmath19 part of the algebra , as well as a ` matrix derivative ' @xcite which acts on the @xmath25 part .",
    "qcd can be included in the model by extending the algebra to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the algebra of @xmath28 matrices with elements in @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , connes et al . have shown that the entire sm can be rewritten in the ncg language @xcite .",
    "the extra - discrete - dimension interpretation of the superconnection model also solves the problem that the prediction @xmath10 is not stable under renormalization group running and can only be imposed at one scale @xcite .",
    "that scale can be interpreted as the scale at which the sm with @xmath10 emerges from the underlying discrete extra dimension model .",
    "the same scale should also characterize the separation of the two ` branes ' in the discrete direction .",
    "given the current experimental knowledge of the sm , this scale turns out to be @xmath30  tev @xcite , suggesting a phenomenology that could potentially be explored at the lhc , as well as the existence of a new fundamental scale of nature at those energies .",
    "we will have more to say about this later .",
    "these developments notwithstanding , a definitive recipe for constructing a ncg kaluza - klein model for a given algebra still seems to be in the works .",
    "different authors use different definitions of the exterior derivative @xmath17 , which , naturally , lead to different higgs sectors and different predictions . in the spectral sm of connes et al .",
    "@xcite , for instance , the prediction for the @xmath31 gauge couplings are of the @xmath32 gut type , pushing up the scale of emergence to the gut scale .",
    "the spectral sm is not particularly predictive either : the fermionic masses and mixings must all be put in by hand into the operator @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the ncg - superconnection approach still has much to be desired and further development is called for .",
    "despite the still incomplete nature of the ncg - superconnection approach , one can still make predictions and assessments based on the sm which we assume to emerge from it at the emergence scale .",
    "we have already commented on the fact that the prediction @xmath10 leads to an emergence scale of @xmath54  tev .",
    "the @xmath0 superconnection also predicts the higgs quartic coupling at that scale , from which in turn one can predict the higgs boson mass to be @xmath5170 gev . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , lowering this prediction down to @xmath5126  gev requires the introduction of extra scalar degrees of freedom which modify the renormalization group equations ( rge ) of the higgs couplings .",
    "those degrees of freedom would be available , for instance , if the @xmath0 superconnection were extended to @xmath2 .",
    "the extra - discrete - dimensional @xmath2 model shares the same prediction for @xmath33 as the @xmath0 version , and therefore the same scale ( @xmath54 tev ) at which an effective @xmath34 gauge theory can be expected to emerge .",
    "thus , explaining the higgs mass within the ncg - superconnection formalism seems to demand an extension of the sm gauge group .",
    "connes et al.s spectral sm with a gut emergence scale also predicts the higgs mass to be @xmath5170 gev .",
    "lowering this to @xmath5126 gev requires the introduction of extra scalar degrees of freedom as discussed above @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "too , the higgs mass seems to suggest that the sm gauge group needs to be extended to @xmath34 , or including the qcd sector , to @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the ncg - superconnection formalism already requires the extension of the sm gauge group to that of the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) , or that of pati - salam @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will take a look at some of the phenomenological consequences of a ncg - superconnection motivated lrsm , in anticipation of the start of the upgraded lhc program in 2015 , and various experiments at the intensity frontier which will be able to constrain new physics via rare decay processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ su21 ] , we first review the @xmath0 superconnection approach to the sm . we follow the bottom - up approach of neeman et al .",

    ", we extend the formalism developed in section  [ su21 ] to the @xmath2 superconnection into which the lrsm gauge group @xmath34 is embedded .",
    "again , the model is reviewed in some detail to clearly present the assumptions that go into its construction , and the resulting predictions including that of the higgs mass .",
    "section  [ fermions ] discusses how fermion masses and mixings can be incorporated into the model .",
    "section  [ pheno ] discusses whether the new particles predicted by the @xmath2 superconnection motivated lrsm are accessible at the lhc and other experiments .",
    "section  [ summary ] concludes with a summary of what was discovered , review of remaining questions , and some speculation on what all this could mean .",
    "the review of the spectral sm of connes et al . is relegated to a subsequent paper @xcite .",

    "we have reviewed the @xmath0 superconnection formalism into which the sm is embedded in some detail , including some sticking points , and looked at its predictions .",

    "though the higgs mass prediction is clearly problematic , the formalism has a couple of interesting and attractive features which deserve attention .",
    "first and foremost , we note that the generalized exterior derivative in the discrete direction , _ i.e. _ the matrix derivative , carries in it information on the higgs vev @xmath415 .",
    "the 0-form field @xmath7 which appears in the superconnection @xmath135 is the fluctuation of @xmath254 around this vev : @xmath416",
    ". thus , the @xmath6 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath417 from the beginning , and there is , in fact , no need to shift the field from @xmath7 to @xmath254 , only to shift it back again to account for the physical degrees of freedom in the broken phase . since the matrix derivative is necessitated by the existence of the discrete extra dimension",
    ", one could argue that it is the dynamical separation of the two branes itself that broke the symmetry and shifted the higgs field .",
    "in other words , it is the dynamics of the discrete geometry of the two branes that is responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking , and the higgs field is just one manifestation of the phenomenon .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual sm point of view in which the higgs dynamics is independent of any dynamics of the background geometry .",
    "second , since the formalism fails to predict the correct higgs mass , it begs an extension to a formalism that would .",
    "this can be viewed as an advantage instead of a drawback of the model since it points us to new directions .",
    "as we @xcite , and other authors have pointed out @xcite , an additional singlet scalar degree of freedom in the higgs sector would mix with the higgs boson to brings its mass down , and a simple way to introduce such a degree of freedom would be to extend the sm electroweak gauge group to @xmath34 . in the superconnection formalism , this gauge group can be embedded into @xmath2 .",
    "thus , despite the absence of our understanding on how these structures arise from an underlying ncg theory , the data already suggest an extension from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "given the limitations of the @xmath0 superconnection model outlined above , here we explore the possibility of using an @xmath2 superconnection to embed the sm electroweak gauge fields and the higgs .",
    "the gauge group embedded will be @xmath34 with the same gauge couplings for @xmath144 and @xmath419 .",

    "we follow the same route as in the previous section : we will first work out the superconnection @xmath135 of the model and find that an bi - doublet scalar field @xmath423 appears in the odd part .",
    "the supercurvature @xmath137 and action @xmath335 are derived from the superconnection @xmath135 , and in the process it is discovered that the matrix derivative @xmath184 in this case can be made nilpotent , and as a consequence , the supercurvature @xmath137 has a simple gauge transformation property which guarantees the gauge invariance of the action @xmath335 . to achieve the breaking of @xmath34 down to @xmath417 , two complex triplet scalar fields @xmath424 and @xmath425 are introduced as matter fields living , respectively , on the left- and right - handed branes .",

    "the breaking of the gauge symmetry is encoded in the geometry , which is given in terms of the fermion masses and from which one extracts the higgs vev , and one could say that the yukawa interactions themselves are consequences rather than the reason for fermion mass .",

    "however , since the extra dimension is also discrete , it is not at all clear what it means to have a ` scale ' associated with it . having zero measure , it can not be populated by extra degrees of freedom , which , for a continuum extra dimension model , would lead to kaluza - klein states .",

    "the @xmath0 superconnection model predicts @xmath10 , a condition which can only be imposed on the @xmath6 gauge couplings at @xmath30 tev .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the sm emerges from the underlying discrete extra dimension theory at that scale .",
    "the model also predicts the higgs mass , which , including rge running down from 4  tev , is @xmath807  gev .    to remedy this problem",
    ", we extended the model to @xmath2 , in which the @xmath34 gauge bosons and a bi - doublet field @xmath423 were embedded into the superconnection .",
    "this extended the sm to the lrsm , for which the emergence scale also turned out to be 4  tev . in this case , additional gauge triplet scalars were introduced to break @xmath535 down to @xmath145 , and the scale of this breaking was also required to be at 4  tev .",
    "the bi - doublet field then broke the @xmath6 symmetry down to @xmath417 .",
    "it was shown that the lightest neutral scalar in the higgs sector could have mass as light as @xmath808 gev .",
    "the model also predicts a plethora of new particles with masses in the multi - tev range , within reach of the lhc run 2 .    of the several salient features of the approach ,",
    "the most interesting is that the generalized exterior derivative in the discrete direction , _",
    "i.e. _ the matrix derivative , shifts the vev of the off - diagonal 0-forms to non - zero values , effectively breaking the gauge symmetries .",
    "thus , gauge symmetry breaking is intimately connected to the geometry of the model spacetime , in particular , to the separation of the two branes .",
    "we envision a scenario in which the two branes , originally overlapping , separate from each other dynamically and trigger gauge symmetry breaking . in other words , the higgs mechanism is not due to the higgs dynamics which is independent of any underlying geometry , but an integral part of the geometry itself , and is quantum gravitational in character .",
    "many problems still remain for the formalism to mature into a full fledged model building paradigm .",
    "first , the lie superalgebra structure is assumed to emerge from some underlying ncg theory , but we have not clarified how the geometry enforces the structure yet .",
    "we would also like to incorporate qcd , quarks , and fermion generations into the structure .",
    "the spectral sm of connes et al . supposedly has already done this , but as commented on earlier , the spectral sm approach does not have much predictive power . also , after the incorporation of qcd into the model , we would like to unify it with the lrsm via the pati - salam group .",
    "the @xmath492 gauge boson being part of the @xmath2 superconnection , this suggests that qcd can not be simply tacked on to the model .",
    "there is also the subtle problem of how the nilpotency of the matrix derivative should be treated . in the @xmath0 case",
    ", the term @xmath224 in the definition of the supercurvature could not be ignored for gauge invariance , but including it led to internal inconsistencies . in the @xmath2 case",
    ", @xmath224 belongs to the center of the superalgebra , so it can be added or subtracted from the super curvature without changing its algebraic properties .",
    "this suggests that one can decide to ignore @xmath224 based on consistency requirements , but one can not shake the impression that the treatment is ad hoc .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath2 case , phenomenological requirements demanded that the nilpotency of the matrix derivative be broken . whether this is another indication of a deep connection between spontaneous symmetry breaking and the geometry of the underlying theory remains to be seen .",
    "these , and other questions will be addressed in future publications .      the major appeal of the more traditional approaches to bsm model building such as supersymmetry ( as well as technicolor , extra dimensions , etc . )",
    "is that they address the hierarchy problem , and that they shed light on the apparent unification of couplings , both within the context of local effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "however , this apparent theoretical appeal of supersymmetry does not exclude approaches that do not necessarily follow the local eft paradigm .",
    "for example , in the spectral sm approach of connes et al .",
    "@xcite the hierarchy problem can be addressed in a completely different fashion @xcite .",
    "the crucial ncg ( and thus in some sense non - local ) aspect of the sm is found in the higgs sector , which in principle comes with an extra ( second ) scale , to be distinguished from the usual uv scale of local eft .",
    "the hierarchy between the higgs and the uv ( planck ) scale can be associated ( as shown by chamseddine and connes in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the natural exponential factor that comes from the dynamical discrete geometry of the higgs sector .",
    "similarly , the apparent gauge unification ( in the guise of an effective @xmath32 relation between the gauge couplings ) is also incorporated into the spectral sm .",
    "these aspects of the ncg approach to the sm are almost completely unknown in the particle physics community , and at the moment , almost completely undeveloped from a phenomenological viewpoint .",
    "one of our aims in our upcoming review of the spectral sm @xcite is to clarify these interesting features of the ncg approach to the sm and make them palatable to the wider phenomenological community .",
    "we are also motivated by a deeper need to understand the limitations of the local eft paradigm from the point of view of the physics of quantum gravity , which is usually , rather naively , ignored at the currently interesting particle physics scales , by invoking the concept of decoupling , which represents another central feature of the local eft and which is also challenged by the ncg approach to the sm .",
    "finally , as we discuss in the next concluding subsection of this paper , the usual rg analysis of the local eft should be re - examined in the new light of the non - commutative / non - local structure of the sm , and the apparent existence of two natural ( and naturally related ) physics scales .      in this concluding subsection",

    "note that the non - commutativity scale @xmath80 plays the role of the natural ir cut - off .",

    "it would be tantalizing if the ncg set - up associated with the sm , and in particular , the lrsm generalization discussed in this paper , would lead to the phenomenon of the uv / ir mixing and the double rg flow with a self - dual fixed point .",
    "finally , we remark that it has been argued in a recent work on quantum gravity and string theory that such uv / ir mixing and the double rg might be a generic feature of quantum gravity coupled to matter @xcite .",
    "even though the ncg in our case is different from this toy example , the lesson in the essential physics of the uv / ir mixing is present in our situation as well : the higgs field can be associated with the natural scale of non - commutativity and thus natural ir scale , and therefore even in our situation we might reasonably expect that the the higgs scale is mixed with the uv cut - off defined by some more fundamental theory .",
    "needless to say , at the moment this is only an exciting conjecture .",
    "if this conjecture is true , given the results presented in this paper one could expect that the appearance of the lrsm degrees of freedom ( as well as the embedded sm degrees of freedom ) at low energy is essentially a direct manifestation of some effective uv / ir mixing , and thus that on one hand the remnants of the uv physics can be expected at a low energy scale of 4 tev , and conversely that the lrsm structure point to some unique features of the high energy physics of quantum gravity . in this context",

    "<S> both the sm in the @xmath0 case and the lrsm in the @xmath2 case are argued to emerge at @xmath4 tev from an underlying theory in which the spacetime geometry is modified by the addition of a discrete extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the formulation of the exterior derivative in this model space suggests a deep connection between the modified geometry , which can be described in the language of non - commutative geometry ( ncg ) , and the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the implication is that spontaneous symmetry breaking could actually be geometric / quantum gravitational in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the non - decoupling phenomenon seen in the higgs sector can then be reinterpreted in a new light as due to the mixing of low energy ( sm ) physics and high energy physics associated with quantum gravity , such as string theory . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of a tev scale lrsm is also discussed , and we argue that some exciting discoveries may await us at the lhc , and other near - future experiments . </S>"
