    "determining the structure of the milky way , from our vantage point within it , is a perpetual challenge for astronomers .",
    "we know the galaxy has spiral arms , but it remains unclear exactly how many ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations of maser proper motions give unprecedented accuracy in determining the three - dimensional position of the galaxy s center and rotation speed @xcite .",
    "but , to date , we still do not have a definitive picture of the milky way s three dimensional structure .",
    "the analysis offered in this paper suggests that some infrared dark clouds  in particular very long , very dark , clouds ",
    "appear to delineate major features of our galaxy as would be seen from outside of it .",
    "in particular , we study a @xmath5-long cloud associated with the irdc called  nessie \" @xcite , and we show that it appears to lie parallel to , and no more than just a few pc from , the true galactic plane .",
    "our analysis uses diverse data sets , but it hinges on combining those data sets with a modern understanding of the meaning of galactic coordinates .",
    "when , in 1959 , the iau established the current system of galactic @xmath6 coordinates @xcite , the positions of the sun with respect to the  true \" galactic disk , and of the galactic center , were not as well determined as they are now . as a result , the galactic plane is typically * not * at @xmath2 , as projected onto the sky .",
    "the exact offset from @xmath2 depends on distance , as we explain in  [ lookingdown ] .",
    "taking these offsets into account , one can profitably re - examine data relevant to the milky way s 3d structure .",
    "the sun s vantage point slightly  above \" the plane of the milky way offers useful perspective .    ",
    "irdcs \" are loosely defined as clouds with column densities high enough to be obvious as patches of significant extinction against the diffuse galactic background at mid  infrared wavelengths .",
    "@xcite set the boundaries of irdcs at an optical depth of 0.35 at @xmath7 wavelength , equivalent to an @xmath8 column density @xmath9 . in the @xcite sample ,",
    "clouds have average column densities of a few @xmath10 .",
    "some irdcs actively form high  mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite explain that while some  starless \" irdcs are potential sites of future high  mass star formation , and the few hundred densest and the most massive , irdcs may very well contain a large fraction of the star ",
    "forming gas in the milky way , it is still true that most irdcs are not massive and dense enough to form high  mass stars .",
    "thus , a small number of very dense and massive irdcs may be responsible for a large fraction of the galactic star formation rate , and an extragalactic observer of the milky way might  see \" irdcs not unlike nessie hosting young massive stars as the predominant mode of star formation here .",
    "the traditional ism - based probes of the milky way s structure have been hi and co. emission in these tracers gives line intensity as a function of velocity , so the position - position - velocity data resulting from hi and co observations can give three dimensional views of the galaxy , if a rotation curve is used to translate line - of - sight velocity into a distance . unfortunately , though , the galaxy is filled with hi and co , so it is very hard to disentangle features when they overlap in velocity along the line of sight .",
    "nonetheless , much of the basic understanding of the milky way s spiral structure we have now comes from hi and co observations of the galaxy , much of it from the compilation of co data presented by @xcite .",
    "recently , several groups have targeted high - mass star - forming regions in the plane of the milky way for high - resolution observation . in their bessel survey ,",
    "reid et al .",
    "are using hundreds of hours of vlba time to observe hundreds of regions for maser emission , which can give both distance and kinematic information for very high - density ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) gas @xcite . in the hops survey ,",
    "hundreds of positions associated with the dense peaks of infrared dark clouds have now been surveyed for @xmath4 emission @xcite , yielding high - spectral resolution velocity measurements towards gas whose density typically exceeds @xmath13 @xmath12 . in follow - up",
    "spectral - line surveys to the atlasgal @xcite dust - based survey of the galactic plane , @xcite have measured @xmath4 emission in nearly 1000 locations .",
    "the thrumms survey aims to map the entire fourth quadrant of the milky way in co and higher - density tracers @xcite , and it should yield additional high - resolution velocity measurements",
    ".    targets in high - resolution ( e.g. bessel ) studies are usually identified based on continuum surveys , which show the locations of the highest column - density regions , either as extinction features (  dark clouds \" in the optical ,  irdcs \" in the infrared ) , as dust emission features ( in surveys of the thermal infrared ) , or as gas emission features ( e.g. hii regions ) .",
    "great power lies in the careful combination of continuum and spectral - line data when one wants to understand the structure of the ism in three - dimensions .",
    "thus , there have already been several efforts to combine dust maps with spectral - line data , whose goal is often the assignment of more accurate distances to particular clouds or regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these improved distances allow for more reliable conversion of measured quantities ( e.g. fluxes ) to physical ones ( e.g. mass ) .    in this study ,",
    "our aim is to combine morphological information from large - scale mid - infrared continuum  dust \" maps of the galactic plane with spectral - line data , so as to understand the nature of very long infrared dark clouds that appear parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "we focus in particular on the irdc named  nessie \" in the study presented by @xcite . in that 2010 paper ,",
    "nessie is shown to be a highly elongated filamentary cloud ( see figure [ fig : findingchart ] ) exhibiting the after - effects of a sausage instability that led to several massive - star - forming peaks spaced at regular intervals .",
    "we extend the work of jackson et al . by first by literally  extending \" the cloud , to a length of at least 3 degrees (  [ longer ] ) . in  [ 3d ] , we show that a careful accounting for the modern measures of the sun s height off of the galactic mid - plane and of the true position of the galactic center imply that nessie lies not just parallel to the galactic plane , but _ in _ the galactic plane .",
    "we consider what velocity - resolved measures of the material associated with nessie tell us about its three - dimensional position in the galaxy , and we conclude , in  [ spine ] that nessie likely marks the  spine \" of the scutum - centaurus arm of the milky way in which it lies . in ",
    "[ future ] , we consider the likelihood of finding more  nessie - like \" structures in the future , and of using them , in conjunction with the sun s vantage point just above the mid - plane of the milky way , to map out the skeleton of our galaxy .",
    "nessie was discovered and named using spitzer space telescope images that show the cloud as a very clear absorption feature at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite . using observations of the dense - gas tracer hnc , jackson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) further show that the section of the cloud from @xmath14337.85 to 339.1 ( labelled  nessie classic \" in figure [ fig : findingchart ] ) exhibits very similar line - of - sight velocities , ranging over @xmath15 km  s@xmath16 .",

    ", our focus is on how long the full nessie feature might be , and on what that length combined with nessie s special position in the galaxy imply about how similar structures can be used to chart the structure of the galaxy .",
    "casual inspection of spitzer imagery given in figure [ fig : findingchart ] suggests that nessie is at least two or three times longer than  nessie classic , \" measuring at least @xmath22 long (  nessie - extended \" ) .",
    "very careful inspection ( pan and zoom figure [ fig : findingchart ] ) of the spitzer images suggests that nessie _ could be _ even longer . if one optimistically connects what appear to be all the relevant pieces then",
    " nessie optimistic \" could be as much as @xmath23 long ( light white chalk line in figure [ fig : findingchart ] ) . the optimism involved in seeing the longest extent for nessie could be warranted if bright star - forming regions have broken up the continuous extinction feature , and/or if the background emission fluctuates enough to make the extinction hard to detect .",
    "determining the physical , three - dimensional , nature of extensions to the nessie cloud requires a detailed analysis of the velocity of the gas associated with the dust responsible for mid - ir extinction .",
    "we offer such an analysis below (  [ 3d ] ) , but here we note that if nessie ( as is nearly certain given its velocity range ) lies in or near the scutum - centaurus arm of the milky way , then its distance is roughly 3.1 kpc ( cf .",
    "jackson et al .",
    "2010 ) . at that distance ,",
    "nessie classic is roughly 80 pc long , nessie extended is 160 pc long , and nessie optimistic is 430 pc long . for any of these lengths , the dark filament s width is of order 0.01 degrees ( 0.5 pc ) , according to jackson et al.s ( 2010 ) analysis of the spitzer imagery .",
    "thus , clouds s axial ratio is about 150 for nessie classic , 300 for nessie extended , and nearly three times more , 800 , for nessie optimistic .",

    "one would naevely expect that any feature this long and skinny that is not controlled by galactic - scale forces will be subject to a variety of instabilities , and would not last long .    until very recently , no numerical simulation of gas in a milky way - like galaxy had sufficient resolution to reveal features as thin as nessie .",
    "as of 2013 , state - of - the - art simulations by @xcite showed many elongated features along and between arms , ] but the thickness of the features was @xmath60 pc , an order of magnitude too coarse .",
    "figures [ fig : simulationtop ] and [ fig : simulationedge ] offer top - down and edge - on snapshots of a brand - new numerical simulation of the gas in a milky way - like spiral galaxy from @xcite , and this simulation is the _ first _ to offer resolution high enough to see potentially nessie - like features .",
    "the arepo moving mesh code used in these new simulations provides resolution @xmath61 pc resolution in regions where the gas density @xmath62 @xmath12 , and slightly better in the highest - density cells .",
    "the high - resolution views of the simulation in the inset in figure [ fig : simulationtop ] and in figure [ fig : simulationedge ] exhibit many spatial features that are as long and thin as nessie .",
    "the overlain lines in figure [ fig : simulationedge ] additionally show that the nessie - like high - contrast filamentary structures like centered in the `` galactic plane '' of the simulation , and that they have vertical extent not unlike nessie ( cf .",

    "so as not to over - emphasize the apparently remarkable agreement of the @xcite simulations and nessie - like structure , we should point out that the simulations do not include the results of feedback from stars and hii regions , nor do they include magnetic fields .",

    "now , we offer these simulations as the first evidence that gas in a spiral galaxy is very likely to contain very high - contrast , extraordinarily long and thin , filamentary structure marking out what we call the galaxy s  skeleton . \"",
    "many of the features that appear to be trailing off from the major spiral arms apparent in figure [ fig : simulationtop ] are similar to the  spurs \" and  feathers \" that have been previously simulated and observed by e. ostriker and colleagues @xcite and seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ic342 ] shows a recent infrared ( wise ) image of the galaxy ic342 @xcite , and it is clear from that image that some ` spiral ' galaxies also exhibit inter - arm filaments that are even more pronounced than the simulated spurs and feathers .",
    "thus , both simulations and observations show long , filamentary , structures within , and between arms .",
    "the highest - resolution simulations @xcite suggest that the highest - contrast filaments tend to largely be found _ in _ the plane of a spiral galaxy ( figure [ fig : simulationedge ] ) associated with arms , rather than inter - arm regions ( figure [ fig : simulationtop ] ) .",
    "but , high - density contrast alone does not imply that a filament lies along a spiral arm rather than between arms .",
    "the existence of many dense cores within nessie ( see  [ ammonia ] ) implies an over - density of at least @xmath63 ( comparing nh@xmath51 gas and co - emitting gas ) at many positions along the filament .",
    "similar over - densities , and strings of dense cores , are seen in many irdcs .",
    "@xcite identified g32.02 + 0.06 as a sinuous , long , thin , 80-pc long  massive molecular filament \" near ( but not quite in ) the galactic plane , and in very recent work , @xcite added seven more  giant molecular filaments \" almost as long and thin as nessie to the list of very long - thin @xmath48 m@xmath64 filamentary irdcs known in the milky way .    in using observations to judge",
    "whether a specific highly - elongated filamentary cloud lies along ( within ) an arm , or is highly inclined to an arm , the velocity of the associated gas offers the most relevant evidence . in the case of nessie ,",
    "the analysis of the hops nh@xmath51 data presented in  [ ammonia ] , showing agreement with spiral arm line - of - sight velocities , and its location at what is predicted to be the vertical center of the scutum - centaurus arm , argues very strongly that nessie is , three - dimensionally , a spine - like  bone \" of the scutum - centaurus arm .",
    "estimates for the mass of nessie under various assumptions are given in table 1 .",
    "jackson et al .",
    "2010 model nessie as a(n unmagnetized ) self - gravitating fluid cylinder supported against collapse by a  turbulent \" analog of thermal pressure , undergoing the sausage instability discussed in @xcite .",
    "for the observed line width of hnc , the theoretical critical mass per unit length , @xmath65 , is 525 @xmath66 for nessie .",
    "but , if , as jackson et al . explain , one estimates @xmath65 using hnc emission itself and ( uncertain ) abundance values for hnc , then @xmath67 .",
    "given that the low end of this range ( @xmath68 , favored by jackson et al . )",
    "gives a very low value for extinction toward nessie ( @xmath69 mag ) , we favor higher values of @xmath65 , needed to be consistent with the observed ir extinction .",
    "recent laboca observations of dust continuum emission from pieces of nessie ( kauffmann , private communication ) , suggest that @xmath65 @xmath70 @xmath63 in the mid - ir - opaque portions of nessie .",
    "so , at present , it would appear that there is at least an order - of - magnitude uncertainty in @xmath65 .",
    "some of this uncertainty is caused by the definition of nessie s shape , which makes it unclear which  mass \" to measure in calculating @xmath65 , but more is due to the vagaries of converting molecular line emission and/or dust continuum to true masses .",
    "what most interests us here is not nessie s exact mass , mass per unit length , or density profile , but instead its total mass as a fraction of the galaxy s mass , so that we can use that estimate in assessing how many nessie - like structures may be findable in the milky way . to begin that assessment , we only need estimate nessie s _ total _ mass . toward that end ,",
    "table 1 offers very simple estimates of the mass of cylinders , whose ( constant ) average density is set so that the typical extinctions associated with nessie s ir - dark ( @xmath71 mag ) and hnc bright ( @xmath72 @xmath70 a few mag ) radii are sensible . using hnc emission directly to calculate mass is dangerous , because , as mentioned above @xcite , the fractional abundance of hnc is uncertain by as much as three orders of magnitude . calculating masses using a filament diameter of @xmath73 pc and a characteristic column density @xmath74 mag ( corresponding a a volume density of @xmath75 @xmath12 ) , nessie classic is @xmath76 m@xmath64 , nessie extended is @xmath77 m@xmath64 and nessie optimistic is @xmath78 m@xmath64 . if one assumes that the envelope traced by the hnc observations of jackson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for nessie classic continues along nessie s length , then the mass of an @xmath79 @xmath12 cylinder with diameter 0.1 pc ( see table 1 ) associated with nessie would be @xmath80 m@xmath64 for classic and @xmath81 m@xmath64 for optimistic . for the optimistic case",
    ", this mass amounts to 2 millionths of the total gas mass ( assuming @xmath82 m@xmath64 total ) of the milky way .",
    "most of the mass in molecular clouds , which typically follows a log - normal distribution ( cf .",
    "* and references therein ) , is at densities substantially lower than the 500 @xmath12 we have used for nessie s outer hnc - emitting regions . for example , @xcite find that the dense gas mass fraction ( dgmf ) in molecular clouds is of order 10 percent , using the mass in sub - mm - emitting dense dusty cores ( from the bgps survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the numerator and the full mass of @xmath83co - emitting clouds ( from the grs survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the denominator .",
    "emission from @xmath83co typically traces of order 10 percent of the total molecular mass ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "so , correcting for a a 10% dgmf and @xmath83co tracing at most 10% of the total h@xmath53 , in the limiting case that _ all _ dense gas were in nessie - like structures , the total number of  nessie optimistics \" that one could find in the milky way is at least 100 times less than the 500,000 listed in table 1 under  number to equal mass of milky way . \" by - eye inspection of figures [ fig : simulationtop ] and [ fig : simulationedge ] gives the impression that roughly 20% of the very high column density ( @xmath84 mag ) gas will be in easy - to - identify long , straight structures .",
    "so , a coarse estimate of  how many nessies \" are detectable in the milky way can be based on the ratio ( @xmath85 ) of the milky way s gas mass divided by nessie s mass traced by hnc , reduced by @xmath86 to account for the dense gas mass fraction , another @xmath87 to account for the ratio of total molecular to @xmath83co - emitting gas , and another at best @xmath88 to account for the topology in evidence in the smith et al .",
    "simulations . that leaves us with an estimate that of order many hundreds to thousands of additional nessie - like features that should be discoverable in the milky way .",
    "and , of course , features nearer to us , and oriented more perpendicular to our line of sight , as nessie is , will be the easiest to find .    to make more robust estimates of how discoverable our galaxy s bones will be , future work should use simulated observations of galaxy simulations like those presented in @xcite , and/or high - resolution extragalactic observations of spiral galaxies , to statistically model",
    "what structures could be observable . for reference , the 40 pc resolution of the interferometric state - of - the - art paws survey of co in the nearby spiral",
    "m51 @xcite is not high enough to find nessie - like structures .",

    "top - down view of the total column density in a simulation of structures forming within a spiral galaxy based on @xcite .",

    "note the white dotted lines drawn at 20 pc above and below the galactic plane ( black line ) , and , by comparing with figure [ fig : coloredlines ] , notice how the scale of the highly - elongated whitest high - density features in this simulation is approximately comparable to nessie . ]",
    "we have long thought that generating an outside - in view of the milky way is impossible , almost as inhabitants of edwin a. abbott s _ flatland _ @xcite residents can not envision a 3d view of their 2d world .",
    "but , we can escape flatland by realizing that the _ tiny offset of the sun above the milky way s midplane can give us a tiny , but useful , bit of perspective on the 3d structure of the milky way_. this view is only useful for mapping structure using very high - contrast , very narrow , features like nessie , because puffier features will overlap too much to be identifiable in such a foreshortened view .",
    "the identification of nessie as a bone - like feature implies that modern observations are good enough , and features are sharp enough , to identify at least some of our galaxy s skeleton .",
    "it turns out that nessie is located in a place where seeing a very long irdc projected parallel to the galactic plane should be easiest .",
    "look again at figure [ fig : topview ] , and consider nessie s placement there . according to the current ( data - based cartoon ) view of the milky way shown in figure [ fig : topview ] , nessie is in the closest major spiral arm ( scutum - centaurus ) to us , along a direction toward , but not exactly toward , the ( confusing ) galactic center .",
    "nessie s placement there means that it will have a bright background illumination as seen from further out in the galaxy ( e.g. from the sun ) , and that it will have a long extent on the sky as compared with more distant or less perpendicular - to - our - line - of - sight objects .",
    "it is always good when one finds what should be the easiest - to - see example of a new phenomenon first , so we are reassured that nessie was the first  bone \" of the milky way found .",
    "now , though , we need to think about how to find bones not as prominent as nessie .",
    "there are essentially two approaches .    in one approach",
    ", one can conduct a strategic search for long thin clouds , or broken pieces of such , in places on the sky where they  should \" occur according to our current understanding of the milky way s spatial and velocity structure . specifically , using current estimates for the milky way s arm s 3d locations , one can draw more velocity - encoded traces like the ones shown in figure [ fig : coloredlines ] on the 2d sky , showing where arms should appear . with such predictions in hand , one can design algorithms to look for dust clouds elongated ( roughly ) along those lines , and then examine the velocity structure of the elongated features , as we do in ",
    "[ 3d ] , above .",
    "of course , one need be flexible about which features one accepts as possible  bones , \" remembering that the model used to draw the expected features on the sky is the same one being refined !",
    "it is likely that an iterative approach , using the extant milky way model as a prior , will succeed in this way .    taking a less targeted survey approach",
    ", one can search the sky for long , thin , dense clouds , and assess their relationship to galactic structure after the fact .",
    "this blind search approach has recently been taken by @xcite in the first quadrant of the milky way , using near and mid - infrared images .",
    "of the seven new clouds ( dubbed  giant molecular filaments \" ) identified by @xcite none appears to be tracing spiral arm structures like nessie .",
    "one cloud , gmf 20.0 - 17.9 , appears to be a spur off of the scutum - centaurus arm . @xcite",
    "confirm our claim that nessie lies in the middle of the scutum - centaurus arm , and they speculate that perhaps identifying bone - like features in the first quadrant is more difficult than in the fourth , where nessie lies .",
    "examining figure [ fig : topview ] , it is clear that nessie and other clouds in the scutum - centaurus arm would be much more perpendicular to our line of sight , and thus easier - to - detect , in the fourth quadrant than in the first , so we agree with ragan et al.s speculation .    in a related approach ,",
    "connect the dots , \" strategy for finding long features is also possible . using the output of exhaustive ( automated ) searches for high - density peaks ,",
    "once can look for non - random , long , straightish , patterns in the distribution of those peaks .",
    "for example , in plotting out the @xcite catalog of the positions of 11,000 roundish high - density peaks on the sky , long thin irdcs appear to the eye as strings of easy - to - connect sources .",
    "nessie itself is comprised of @xmath49 peretto & fuller sources superimposed on a slightly - lower - density connecting structure",
    ". it may be possible to use automated structure - finding algorithms , such as minimum spanning trees , to connect - the - peaks in efforts to identify additional bones of the milky way .",
    "prior to our work on assessing the role of ( a lengthened ) nessie in galactic structure , and ragan et al.s 2014 survey , at least two other exceptionally long molecular clouds near the galactic plane were presented in the literature .",
    "the so - called  massive molecular filament \" g32.02 + 0.06 , studied by @xcite , does not appear to be tracing an arm structure . and the 500-pc long molecular  wisp \" discussed by",
    "also does not presently appear directly related to galactic structure , although it is interesting to think about its past . as we discuss in",
    " [ spine ] , it will likely prove important to model the effects of feedback on the evolution of bone - like star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "none of the other long , thin , dense clouds discovered to date are as elongated _ and _ straight as nessie .",
    "intuitively , one can guess that over very long time scales , the star formation going on with clouds like nessie will re - shape them and break them into pieces very hard to recognize as ever having been bone - like .    as extinction , dust emission , and",
    "molecular spectral - line maps cover more and more of the sky at ever - improving resolution and sensitivity , it should be possible to map more and more of the milky way s skeleton .",
    "new wide - field extinction - based efforts based at first on pan - starrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ultimately on gaia , will be tremendously helpful in these efforts in the coming decade . once enough features are identified on the sky and in 3d space using dust maps , and in position - position - velocity space ( using information from spectral - line observations )",
    ", it should be possible to fit features together into a skeletal pattern of arms , spurs , and more , in much the same way one solves a jigsaw puzzle by finding the most obvious connections first .",
    "ultimately , we may have enough examples of  bones \" to apply a machine - learning algorithm that would search for additional pieces of the milky way s skeleton based on known examples , in much the same way that @xcite used the output of the milky way project s citizen science effort as input to a support vector machine algorithm that quantifies estimates of the density and characteristics of bubble - like features in the interstellar medium .",
    "while many long , thin , irdcs will likely be identified in the coming years as  bones \" of the milky way , it is important to point out that not every long - thin irdc should be expected to trace a spiral arm . the image of ic342 in figure [ fig : ic342 ] and the simulation in figure [ fig : simulationtop ]",
    "illustrate that spiral galaxies structure can include much more than arm - like high - contrast structures , and we can predict that shear and feedback disrupt long features over time .",
