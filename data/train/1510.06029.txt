    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binaries composed of a compact object ( co ; neutron star ; ns ; or a black hole ; bh ) accreting from a lower mass , typically main sequence ( ms ) stellar companion with @xmath3 .",
    "the co accretes through an accretion disc that generates x - ray emission ( see @xcite for overviews ) .",
    "most lmxbs are found in the field , but @xmath4 @xcite are found in globular cluster ( gc ) .",
    "given that only @xmath5 of stars reside in gcs , this result suggests that the environment of gcs is highly conducive to the formation of lmxbs .",
    "it is thought that close encounters in gcs give rise to tidal capture of stars by cos , and the high formation rate of lmxbs .",
    "however , the origin of field lmxbs is still debated , as binary stellar evolution models encounter various challenges in producing lmxbs , and in particular formation of bh lmxbs @xcite , where the outcomes of the common envelope phase pose major difficulties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution of lmxbs is not well understood.@xcite studied the radial distribution of lmxbs in the bulge of m31 .",
    "they found that the radial density distribution in the _ bulge _ of m31 is consistent with a power law @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but the density profile becomes more shallow towards the galaxy outer regions . for field lmxbs at larger distances it appears that the number of lmxbs scale like the stellar light , which translates to direct scaling with the stellar number density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the lmxbs systems are formed in - situ , namely in the field and not in dense environments like gc .",
    "most studies of field lmxbs explored their formation through binary stellar evolution of isolated close binaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested they may form through tidal capture processes similar to those occurring in gcs , at least in the inner dense region of galaxies ; this , however , may not apply to most lmxbs outside the inner dense regions of galaxies .",
    "here we suggest a novel scenario in which field lmxb could originate from very wide binary progenitors ( semi - major axis;@xmath8 au ) , each composed of a co and a low mass ms star .",
    "such wide binaries can be perturbed by encounters with field stars and be excited into highly eccentric orbits",
    ". a sufficiently high eccentricity can then give rise to a close peri - center approach of the companion star of the co , resulting in a tidal interaction and the formation of a compact binary lmxb , somewhat similar to the tidal capture formation of lmxbs in gcs .",
    "this approach follows the recent study by @xcite who showed that the components of wide main sequence stellar binaries in the field could have high rates of collisions / mergers through such a process .    motivated by this approach we calculated the formation rates of lmxbs in the field from such processes .",
    "we find that under plausible conditions this formation channel could explain the population of field lmxbs , and in particular bh lmxbs , as well as give rise to unique predictions about their properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formation - of - lmxbs ] we present the theory for the formation of a lmxb from a wide binary . in section [ sec : channels - of - formation ] we specify the main channels of formation , and present the expected formation rate in the galactic disk . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results and summarize .",
    "let us consider a wide binary , @xmath9 , with a stellar mass bh or ns primary and a ms stellar companion .",
    "the system is affected by two different perturbations .",
    "first , the galactic tide by the host galaxy and in our case is the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "second , short duration dynamical interactions with field stars . here",
    "we focus on the latter , likely stronger effect .",
    "the dynamical encounters can typically be modeled through the impulse approximation , i.e. in the regime where the interaction time is much shorter than the orbital period time .",
    "these perturbations can torque the system , change the orbital angular momentum , and exchange orbital energy thereby decreasing / increasing the binary semi - major axis @xmath10 .",
    "if such effects drive the system to a sufficiently small periastron passage , @xmath11 , tidal effects on the ms star become important .",
    "such tides can potentially produce significant dissipation even during a single close approach and drive the binary into a short period orbit , as suggested to occur in tidal capture scenarios in dense stellar systems .",
    "the small separation between the co and the ms can then lead to a roche lobe over flow ( rlof ) onto the compact object , and consequently produce a lmxb .      in this section",
    "we derive the formation rate of lmxbs from wide , @xmath9 , binary systems .",
    "the derivation follows the same approach as @xcite and @xcite , however , here we consider the applications and implications for the formation of lmxbs ; we refer the reader to these papers for additional details .",
    "here we briefly review the calculation , highlighting the main points and the minor differences arising from the consideration of non equal - mass binaries .",
    "consider an ensemble of isotropic wide binaries , each consisting of a ms star with mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 and a co with mass @xmath14 .",
    "the binaries are assumed to have the same sma , with a thermal distribution of eccentricities ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we derive the probability of forming lmxbs from this ensemble and find its dependence on the sma of the binaries , @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite showed that for ms - ms wide binary , tidal circularization becomes important for pericenter approaches below the tidal barrier @xmath16 , @xmath17 . for our co - ms case we need to correct this tidal barrier .",
    "first , we assume that no tidal forces act on the co star ( which radius is negligible in this context ) , which decreases the tidal dissipation effect by a factor of 1/2 .",
    "second , we need to account for the change in the tidal force due to the change of @xmath18 , this gives rise to additional a factor of @xmath19 combining the two factors gives : @xmath20    orbits which periastron becomes equal to or smaller than @xmath21 will circularize / tidally disrupt or collide with the co and no longer be wide binaries ; such orbits are termed loss cone orbits .",
    "the fraction of orbits occupying the lose cone for thermalized ensemble is @xmath22    after one orbital period , all wide binaries with loss - cone orbits are `` destroyed '' ( in the sense that they are no longer wide binaries ) as they approach peri - center .",
    "other binaries outside the loss - cone can be perturbed as to change their angular momentum and replenish the loss cone .",
    "the average size of the phase - space region into which stars are perturbed during a single orbital period is termed the smear cone , defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the binary ms companion velocity for a distance of @xmath25 with sma of @xmath10 , and @xmath26 is the average change in the velocity over an orbital period due to perturbations @xcite .",
    "let us consider fly - by interactions using the impulse approximation , where the interaction is considered to be in the impulsive regime for which the interaction time , @xmath27 , is much shorter than the binary period , @xmath28 .",
    "hills shows that on average the velocity change ( for a binary with sma , @xmath10 ) , to the binary components is of the order of @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity of the fly - by star with respect to the binary center of mass and @xmath31 is the closest approach distance of a fly - by ( for the complete derivation see @xcite ) . in kaib and raymond s calculation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced mass of the binary . in our case",
    "the binary is composed of two different mass components and we get @xmath34 hence the angular size of the smear cone cause by the impulse of the fly - by on the binary is @xmath35 and for @xmath36 we get the fractional size of the smear - cone over the @xmath37 sphere to be @xmath38 the only difference between our expression and the one presented in @xcite and @xcite is a factor of @xmath39 .",
    "the condition for the loss cone to be continuously full is that the sizes of the lose cone and the smear cone to be equal , i.e. the loss - cone orbits are replenished at least as fast as they are depleted due to the tidal interactions at peri - center .",
    "this equilibrium occurs when @xmath40    in this case , the full loss cone case rate of binaries being `` lost '' from our ensemble depends on the size of the loss cone ( i.e. the fraction of binaries are on lost - cone orbits ) , and on the period time of the binary itself , the time it takes for a binary with a loss - cone orbit to be destroyed @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass of the binary and @xmath43 is the period of the binary .",
    "note that the loss rate is independent of the stellar density in the field , i.e. once the stellar density is sufficiently large as to fill the loss - cone , the loss rate is saturated , and becomes independent of the perturbation rate .",
    "furthermore , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : loss_rate ] ) that the full loss - cone rate scales like @xmath44 , i.e. the full loss - cone rate decreases with increasing sma .",
    "as one goes to smaller smas , the loss rate increases until it approaches @xmath45 , at which point the loss - cone is no longer full . at this regime ,",
    "the empty loss cone regime , the rate is not determined by the size of the loss cone , but by the rate in which binaries are perturbed into the loss - cone . hence in order to calculate the loss rate in the empty loss cone regime we need to estimate the rate of encounters .",
    "we can express the rate of flyby encounters by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the stellar density , @xmath48 is the geometric cross - section and @xmath49 is the velocity of the fly - by s . given the stellar density , @xmath47 we need to find an expression for the geometric cross - section and the velocity .",
    "( [ eq : f_s / f_q ] ) gives us the condition for the crossover from the full to empty loss cone regime .",
    "equating eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_s / f_q ] ) to unity we find the condition @xmath50 and the the rate @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 note that the loss rate of binaries increases with @xmath51 only until it reaches the orbital frequency . beyond this point",
    "we are in the full loss - cone regime and the loss rate saturates and remains constant .    combining these considerations together , one can see that at small separations the loss - rate is determined by the empty loss - cone and increases with the binary sma , until we reach a critical sma , @xmath53 , at which the loss cone becomes full , and the loss rate is determined by the full loss - cone , and now decreases with larger smas .",
    "the maximal rate is therefore obtained for binaries with the critical sma . to compute @xmath53 we equate @xmath51 with the orbital frequency , @xmath54 and solve for @xmath55 : @xmath56^{1/7}\\label{eq : a_crit}\\ ] ] which differs from @xcite by a factor of @xmath57 , i.e. for binaries with more massive compact object , the empty loss cone regime becomes more important as the @xmath53 value is larger .",
    "the loss probability is calculated differently for the two different regimes . for the empty loss cone regime",
    "the limiting factor is the value of the function @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath58 is the fraction of wide binaries destroyed , and therefore @xmath59 represents the fraction of binaries that survive as wide binaries at the relevant timescale .",
    "for the full loss cone regime the relevant timescale is @xmath60 ; for the empty loss cone regime the relevant timescale is @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , this term is a monotonically decreasing function of time , and the probability for a wide binary to closely interact at peri - center and no longer survive as a wide binary is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the time since birth of the binary . as one can expect the probability only depends on the size of the loss cone and the rate of interactions . for the limit of @xmath63 we can expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : empty_prob ] ) and take the leading term , to find the loss probability to be approximated by @xmath64 substituting the function @xmath51 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_value ] ) and the value @xmath58 from eq.([eq : f_q ] ) we then get @xmath65 note that there is no @xmath66 dependence in this case , and the probability differs from that obtained by @xcite only by a numerical factor .    for the full loss cone regime",
    "the limiting factor is not the value of @xmath51 , but rather the orbital period and/or the orbital frequency .",
    "therefore , the full expression for the loss probability for @xmath67 is @xmath68 for the limit @xmath69 we can approximate the probability by @xmath70 where the probability is increased by a factor of @xmath66 in this case .",
    "the above calculations provide the estimated rates for a simplified scenario , where binaries are randomly perturbed and continue to evolve until they produce lmxbs when their components have close interactions . in reality",
    ", the perturbations may also `` ionize '' a binary and destroy it , namely , the binary is disrupted by the random fly - by s .",
    "such ionization process decreases the available number of wide binaries , and consequently lowers the rates of lmxbs formation . to account for the ionization process",
    "we consider the finite lifetime of wide binaries due to flybys using the approximate relation given by @xcite for @xmath71 , the half - life time of a wide binary evolving through encounters @xmath72 taking this into account we can correct for eq .",
    "( [ eq : empty_propb_express ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_prob_apx_express ] ) to get @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mean lifetime of the binary .      using the above model to calculate the probability for close interactions leading to lmxb formation we can now derive an overall estimate for the formation rate of lmxbs , by considering realistic distributions for the initial conditions for the wide binaries population and stellar number densities . in order to do",
    "so we need to integrate the loss probabilities weighted by the sma distribution of wide binaries for all sma in the binaries ensemble .",
    "we assume that the sma distribution of wide binaries follows a log - uniform distribution in @xmath10 , namely @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the sma distribution of the wide binaries population @xcite .",
    "we consider binaries in the range from @xmath78 up to @xmath79 , where the maximal value is due to cutoff by the galactic tide .",
    "this estimated rate mostly depends on @xmath53 .",
    "the values of @xmath53 can be divided to two distinct regimes : the empty cone which scales like the stellar density @xmath47 and the full cone regimes which is constant in @xmath47 . for the expression of @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_crit ] ) we find that there exists a value of @xmath80 for which @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that for a given stellar density satisfying @xmath82 the ensemble is always in the empty loss cone regime and therefore the probability scales like @xmath47 and the number of formed lmxb systems scales like @xmath83 .",
    "this argument neglects the ionization process described earlier .",
    "binary ionization changes the scaling . following ( [ eq : ionization empty ] ) , we can write the equation explicitly to get @xmath84    @xmath85    which has no density dependence . in our case",
    "it should be noted that typically @xmath86 for the wide binaries we consider .",
    "we therefore conclude that once ionization is accounted for , the formation probability of lmxbs in this regime is density independent . to obtain the total formation rates we therefore only need to multiply the probability for lmxb formation per system by the total number of systems . in other words ,",
    "the total number of formed system depends only linearly on the number density of wide binaries , which follows the background stellar density ; hence , the number density of formed lmxb systems scales like the stellar number density , @xmath47 in this regime .    for densities larger than @xmath87 , which comprise only a small part of the galaxy , we have contributions from both the empty loss cone and the full cone regimes . if we consider the dependence on density in this regime we need to add the different components to get @xmath88 @xmath89    @xmath90    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are some calculable constant pre - factors .",
    "note that the density dependence differs for different @xmath77 distributions .    to illustrate these issues ,",
    "let us consider an ensemble of binaries all of which with a primary co component with @xmath93 , a secondary of @xmath94 and , an age of @xmath95 and the secondary radius of @xmath96 ( which affects the the strength of the tidal interactions ) . in fig .",

    "[ fig : a_crit vs density-1 ] ( right panel ) we see the formation probability of lmxbs for @xmath98 and the two regimes are noticeable .",
    "the linear slope corresponds to eq .",
    "[ eq : empty_propb_express ] and the decaying curve corresponds to eq . [ eq : full_prob_apx_express ] ( see very similar fig . in @xcite ) .",
    "in order to calculate the total number of field lmxbs formed in the galactic disk , we need to integrate over the contribution from all regions of the galaxy .",
    "let us then consider @xmath99 to be the the number of stars in a region @xmath100 ( and scale height @xmath101 ) , located at distance @xmath102 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "following @xcite and references within we model the galactic stellar density in the galactic disk as follows @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the stellar density near our sun , @xmath105 @xcite is the galactic length scale and @xmath106 is the distance of the sun from the galactic center . integrating over the stellar densities throughout the galaxy",
    "we can obtain the total yield of lmxbs in the galaxy through this process .",
    "the results of these calculations are discussed in depth in the next sections .      before continuing to discuss various channels for lmxb formation through wide binaries scatterings ( and the number of lmxbs they produce )",
    ", we briefly mention several important caveats , uncertainties and explicit assumptions used in the suggested model .    *",
    "we tacitly assume that all tidal captures of a ms star by a co leads to the formation of an lmxb , as similarly assumed by previous authors discussing tidal capture formation of lmxbs in dense stellar environments .",
    "however , the evolution of a tidally captured binary may not always lead to lmxb formation and other end products may also result from such evolution . for a detailed discussion of the post - capture evolution of binaries see @xcite * the sma distribution of wide binaries , and in particular high mass binaries is not well determined . in eq .",
    "[ eq : density_power ] we use the value of @xmath77 to be log uniform , as suggested by limited observational data for low mass wide binaries , and suggested theoretical studies for the formation of wide binaries @xcite . *",
    "the actual lifetime of lmxbs is not well determined ; here we use a typical lifetime discussed in the literature @xcite of 1 gyr .",
    "in this section we estimate the number of lmxbs formed by wide binary progenitors in the galaxy , based on the detailed calculations described in the previous sections ( see section [ sec : formation - of - lmxbs ] ) .",
    "the formation rates strongly depend on the frequency of the wide massive binary progenitors .",
    "since the latter is not yet determined observationally , we consider various possible formation channels of wide - binaries containing a ns or a bh , and consider the implications of the different channels on the formation rates of lmxbs .    in subsections [ sub : single - bh ] and [ sub : single - ns - via ]",
    "we describe the formation of bh - ms and ns - ms wide binaries , respectively , through the cluster - dispersal scenario in which a single compact object captures a wide stellar companion following the dispersal of the host cluster ; in subsection [ sub : binaries ] we consider primordially formed wide binaries which survive the stellar evolution stage leading to the birth of the compact object .",
    "the resulting wide co - binary populations in each of these scenarios also depend on specific assumptions regarding the formation of the compact objects and their natal kicks , if such occur .",
    "tables [ tab : number - of - singlebh - ms]-[tab : bh - ms binary ] summarize the different formation channels , the various assumptions made for each specific model , and the total number of lmxbs expected to have formed through these scenarios .",
    "most stars are born in stellar clusters and associations , which later disperse @xcite . following the cluster dispersal",
    ", stars may leave the cluster with small relative velocities and become bound binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such post - dispersal formed binaries typically have very wide orbits which could explain the origin of wide binaries in the field . in the following we consider this scenario for the origin of wide binaries and its implications for the formation of lmxbs .",
    "consider a single bh which still resides in its host open cluster after its formation .",
    "@xcite showed that as an open cluster dissolves massive objects are more likely to capture a companion star and form wide binaries in the cluster - dispersal scenario .",
    "primaries of mass @xmath107 have a wide binary fraction ( bf ) of @xmath108 .",
    "a fraction of @xmath109 of these wide binaries have separations in the range @xmath110 , and we can therefore find the number of wide binaries formed through this process .",
    "however , we still need to determine how many bhs still reside in their host clusters after their violent birth .",
    "in particular , if bhs are kicked upon formation they may escape their host cluster and will not be able to dynamically capture a wide companion .",
    "the existence and the amplitude of bh natal kicks is still not understood ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) , and we therefore consider several possible cases .",
    "we first consider the case in which bh kicks are derived from the natal kicks of nss that form in the process , before collapsing to become bhs . in this case",
    "we use a maxwellian distribution for the velocities of ns natal kicks and explore three different velocity dispersions @xmath111@xcite , consistent with observations of the velocity distribution of young pulsars .",
    "we first assume that the bhs have the same _ momentum _ kick as nss , and therefore their actual kick velocities are inversely proportional to the ratio between the mass of the bh and the mass of a typical ns , namely @xmath112 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we generally use an average bh mass of @xmath113 .",
    "we calculate analytically the fraction of the bh which have a velocity kick smaller than the escape velocity of the cluster @xmath114 where we consider several values for the cluster escape velocity @xmath115 .",

    "another origin of lmxb in destabilized triples has been suggested by @xcite .      in the previous section we considered wide binary progenitors formed through the cluster - dispersal capture scenario . in the following",
    "we consider primordial wide binary progenitors .",
    "here we consider primordial wide binaries , where again we chose typical values of @xmath113 and a @xmath197 . to calculate the frequency and distribution of such binaries",
    ", we have used the bse @xcite binary evolution population synthesis code where the initial binary population was created following the observed binary properties as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "we find that a fraction of @xmath198 of the systems produce wide bh - ms binaries , assuming no natal kicks is given to the bhs .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : bh - ms binary ] .",
    "note that fraction of formed bh - ms wide binaries when momentum kick is imparted to the bhs at birth is negligible ( the escape velocity of wide binaries is very low , and the kick easily disrupt them ) .",
    "@xmath130 & @xmath131 +   & momentum kick for all progenitor masses .",
    "@xmath161 ; @xmath199 & @xmath200 & @xmath201 +   & no momentum kick for @xmath160 ; @xmath161 & @xmath202 & @xmath203 +",
    "in this work we explored a novel channel for formation of bh - lmxbs in the field from wide binary progenitors .",
    "we showed that a co - ms wide binary ( @xmath0 au ) that undergoes perturbations from fly - by s in the field , can have a finite probability to be kicked into an sufficiently eccentric orbit and be affected by tidal interactions .",
    "it can then evolve into a short period orbit , and eventually produce an x - ray binary once the stellar companion fills its roch - lobe .",
    "we find that the formation rate of lmxbs through this channel strongly depends on the frequency of wide bh - ms binaries .",
    "the frequency of such binaries is sensitive to the natal kick given to bhs at birth .",
    "silent formation of bhs from direct collapse with no natal kicks allows for the existence of a significant number of wide bh - ms binaries that can produce lmxbs . depending on the formation scenario of the wide binaries , either as primordial binaries or through the cluster - dispersal capture scenario",
    ", we find that hundreds or thousands of bh - lmxbs could have formed in the galactic disk through this channel , respectively , consistent with the numbers of field lmxbs inferred from observations .",
    "however , if bhs receive natal kicks at birth with comparable momentum kick as ns natal kicks , only a few @xmath204 lmxbs could form through this channel , depending on specific assumptions ( see table [ tab : number - of - singlebh - ms ] for details ) .",
    "ns lmxbs form in negligible numbers for typical ns natal kicks .",
    "nss forming with low velocity natal kicks ( e.g. possibly through electron - capture channel ) produce up to the formation of a few tens or more lmxbs , depending on specific assumptions .",
    "the wide - binary progenitor model for the formation of lmxbs give rise to specific observational signatures , which can differentiate them from other models .",
    "in particular they suggest a natural origin for the otherwise puzzling observed companion mass function , and the high number of field lmxbs in low density environments . these can be summarized as follows :    * * spatial distribution * : as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : dependence - on - stellar ] the distribution of lmxbs in the field scales with the background stellar density like @xmath205 ; where typically generally the distribution of lmxbs should follow the stellar light @xcite , besides in the more dense regions in the inner parts of the galaxy . * * companion mass function * : the bh - companion mass in observed lmxbs is found to be in the range @xmath206 @xmath207 , peaking at 0.6 @xmath207 ; this is inconsistent with all of the currently suggested models for lmxbs formation through common - envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "however , in our suggested wide - binary progenitor scenario the mass function of the bh companion in the lmxb is expected to follow the mass function of stellar companions in massive wide binaries . in the cluster - dispersal capture scenario origin of wide binaries",
    ", the companion mass function should generally follow the mass function of field stars .",
    "the observed mass ratio of o star binaries with wide companions scale like @xmath208 ( priv .",
    "maxwell moe 2015 ) , where @xmath11 is the secondary to primary mass ratio .",
    "this distribution is consistent with random pairing with present day mass function , peaking at a few 0.1 @xmath207 .",
    "our models therefore provides a unique signature and can explain the companion mass function in lmxbs , which challenges other formation scenarios . * * additional wide companions * : as mentioned here and explored in depth by @xcite , secular evolution in wide triples can potentially provide another alternative model for lmxb formation without a challenging common - envelope phase .",
    "one might then generally expect the existence of a wide third companion to the lmxbs .",
    "though not excluded , such an additional companion is not required in the wide - binary progenitor model .",
    "the frequency of third wide companions to lmxbs could therefore potentially differentiate the two different models .",
