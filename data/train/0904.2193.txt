    "let @xmath2 be a bounded open set in @xmath3 and let us denote by @xmath4 its eigenvalues for the laplacian operator with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "problems linking the shape of a domain to the sequence of its eigenvalues , or to some function of them , are among the most fascinating of mathematical analysis or differential geometry .",
    "in particular , problems of minimization of eigenvalues , or combination of eigenvalues , brought about many deep works since the early part of the twentieth century .",
    "actually , this question appears first in the famous book of lord rayleigh `` the theory of sound '' .",
    "thanks to some explicit computations and `` physical evidence '' , lord rayleigh conjectured that the disk should minimize the first dirichlet eigenvalue @xmath5 of the laplacian among plane open sets of given area . this result has been proved later by faber and krahn using a rearrangement technique .",
    "then , many other similar `` isoperimetric problems '' have been considered . for a survey on these questions ,",
    "we refer to the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and to the recent books @xcite , @xcite .",
    "usually , in these minimization problems , one works in the class of sets with a given measure . in this paper , on the contrary we choose to look at similar problems but with a constraint on the perimeter of the competing sets .",
    "apart the mathematical own interest of this question , the reason which led us to consider this problem is the following . studying the famous gap problem ( originally considered in @xcite ,",
    "see section 7 in @xcite for a comprehensive bibliography on this problem ) , we were interested in minimizing @xmath6 , and more generally @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , among ( convex ) open sets of given diameter .",
    "looking at the limiting case @xmath9 , we realized that the optimal set ( which does exist ) is a body of constant width .",
    "since all bodies of constant width have the same perimeter in dimension two , we were naturally led to consider the problem of minimizing @xmath10 among sets of given perimeter .",
    "in particular , if the solution was a ball ( or more generally a body of constant width ) , it would give the answer to the previous problem .",
    "unfortunately , as it is shown in theorem [ theo3 ] , it is not the case !",
    "the minimizer that we are able to identify and characterize here ( at least in two dimension ) is a particular regular convex body , with two points on its boundary where the curvature vanishes .",
    "it is worth observing that the four following minimization problems for the second eigenvalue have different solutions :    * with a volume constraint : two identical disks ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , * with a volume and a convexity constraint : a stadium - like set ( see @xcite ) , * with a perimeter constraint : the convex set described in this paper , * with a diameter constraint : we conjecture that the solution is a disk .",
    "let us remark that the same problems for the first eigenvalue all have the disk as the solution thanks to faber - krahn inequality and the classical isoperimetric inequality .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] is devoted to the complete study of the two - dimensional problem .",
    "we first prove the existence of a minimizer and its @xmath11 regularity .",
    "then , we give some other qualitative and geometric properties of the minimizer . for that purpose ,",
    "we use boundary variation ( the classical hadamard s formulae ) which leads to an overdetermined boundary value problem , with @xmath12 proportional to the curvature of the boundary .",
    "we use this boundary condition to prove that the boundary of the optimal domain does not contain any arc of circle and segment and that the curvature of the boundary vanishes at exactly two points . in section [ sec3 ] , we consider the problem in higher dimension ; this case is much more complicated since we can not use the trick of convexification , and actually we conjecture that optimal domains are not convex ( see section [ further ] on open problems ) .",
    "we first give some preliminaries on capacity and @xmath1-convergence ( we refer to the book @xcite for all details ) , then we consider a quite general minimization problem for a class of functionals decreasing with respect to set inclusion and which are @xmath1 lower semicontinuous .",
    "we work here with measurable sets with bounded perimeter which are included in some fixed bounded domain @xmath13 . as theorem",
    "[ equivrel ] shows , this relaxed problem is equivalent to the initial problem . for the second eigenvalue of the laplacian",
    "we moreover prove that we can get rid of the assumption that the sets lie in some bounded subset of @xmath14 .",
    "we want to solve the minimization problem @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the second eigenvalue of the laplacian with dirichlet boundary condition on the bounded open set @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes the perimeter ( in the sense of de giorgi ) of @xmath17 .",
    "the monotonicity of the eigenvalues of the dirichlet - laplacian with respect to the inclusion has two easy consequences :    1 .   if @xmath19 denotes the convex hull of @xmath17 , since _ in two dimensions",
    "_ and for a connected set , @xmath20 , it is clear that we can restrict ourselves to look for minimizers in the class of _ convex sets _ with perimeter less or equal than @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   obviously",
    ", it is equivalent to consider the constraint @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "of course , point 1 above easily implies existence ( see theorem [ theo1 ] below ) , but is no longer true in higher dimension which makes the existence proof much harder , see theorem [ bh07 ] .",
    "for the regularity of optimal domains the following lemma will be used .",
    "[ lem1 ] if @xmath17 is a minimizer of problem , then @xmath10 is simple .",
    "the idea of the proof is to show that a double eigenvalue would split under boundary perturbation of the domain , with one of the eigenvalues going down .",
    "a very similar result is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5.10 ) .",
    "the new difficulties here are the perimeter constraint ( instead of the volume ) and the fact that the domain @xmath2 is convex , but not necessarily regular . nevertheless , we know that any eigenfunction of a convex domain is in the sobolev space @xmath24 , see @xcite .",
    "let us assume , for a contradiction , that @xmath16 is not simple , then it is double because @xmath2 is a convex domain in the plane , see @xcite .",
    "let us recall the result of derivability of eigenvalues in the multiple case ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "assume that the domain @xmath2 is modified by a regular vector field @xmath25 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath26 the image of @xmath17 by this transformation .",
    "of course , @xmath27 may be not convex but we have actually no convexity constraint ( since convexity come for free ) and this has no consequence on the differentiability of @xmath28 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath29 two orthonormal eigenfunctions associated to @xmath30 .",
    "then , the first variation of @xmath31 are the repeated eigenvalues of the @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 now , let us introduce the lagrangian @xmath34 . as we will see in the proof of theorem [ theo1 ] ,",
    "the perimeter is differentiable and the derivative is a linear form in @xmath35 supported on @xmath36 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 5.4.16 ) ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath37 this derivative .",
    "so the lagrangian @xmath38 has a derivative which is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the identity matrix .",
    "therefore , to reach a contradiction ( with the optimality of @xmath17 ) , it suffices to prove that one can always find a deformation field @xmath41 such that the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix is negative .",
    "let us consider two points @xmath42 and @xmath43 on @xmath36 and two small neighborhoods @xmath44 and @xmath45 of these two points of same length , say @xmath46 .",
    "let us choose any regular function @xmath47 defined on @xmath48 ( vanishing at the extremities of the interval ) and a deformation field @xmath41 such that @xmath49 then , the matrix @xmath39 splits into two matrices @xmath50 where @xmath51 is defined by ( and a similar formula for @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 in particular , it is clear that the exchange of @xmath42 and @xmath43 replaces the matrix @xmath50 by its opposite .",
    "therefore , the only case where one would be unable to choose two points @xmath54 and a deformation @xmath55 such that the matrix has a negative eigenvalue is if @xmath50 is identically zero for any @xmath55 . but",
    "this implies , in particular @xmath56 and @xmath57\\,\\varphi\\,d\\sigma = \\int_{\\gamma_b}\\big[\\big(\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial n}\\big)^2-\\big(\\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial n}\\big)^2\\big]\\,\\varphi\\,d\\sigma\\ ] ] for any regular @xmath55 and any points @xmath42 and @xmath43 on @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that the product @xmath58 and the difference @xmath59 should be constant a.e . on @xmath36 . as a consequence @xmath60 has to be constant . since the nodal line of the second eigenfunction touches the boundary in two points ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , @xmath61 has to change sign .",
    "so we get a function belonging to @xmath62 taking values @xmath21 and @xmath63 on sets of positive measure , which is absurd , unless @xmath64 .",
    "this last issue is impossible by the holmgren uniqueness theorem .",
    "we are now in a position to prove the existence and regularity of optimal domains for problem .",
    "[ theo1 ] there exists a minimizer @xmath17 for problem and @xmath17 is of class @xmath11 .    to show the existence of a solution we use the direct method of calculus of variations .",
    "let @xmath65 be a minimizing sequence that , according to point 1 above , we can assume made by convex sets .",
    "moreover , @xmath65 is a bounded sequence because of the perimeter constraint . therefore , there exists a convex domain @xmath17 and a subsequence still denoted by @xmath65 such that :    * @xmath65 converges to @xmath17 for the hausdorff metric and for the @xmath66 convergence of characteristic functions ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4.10 ) ) ; since @xmath65 and @xmath17 are convex this implies that @xmath67 in the @xmath1-convergence ; * @xmath22 ( because of the lower semicontinuity of the perimeter for the @xmath66 convergence of characteristic functions , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3.6 ) ) ; * @xmath68 ( continuity of the eigenvalues for the @xmath1-convergence , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.4.6 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.3.17 ) , see also section [ seccap ] below ) .    therefore , @xmath17 is a solution of problem .",
    "we notice that the limit @xmath2 is a `` true '' domain ( i.e. it is not the empty set ) ; indeed any degenerating sequence , a sequence shrinking to a segment for instance , converges to the empty set , thus the second eigenvalue blows to infinity .",
    "we go on with the proof of regularity , which is classical , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we refer also to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for similar results in a more complicated context .",
    "let us consider ( locally ) the boundary of @xmath36 as the graph of a ( concave ) function @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "we make a perturbation of @xmath36 using a regular function @xmath71 compactly supported in @xmath72 , i.e. we look at @xmath26 whose boundary is @xmath73 .",
    "the function @xmath74 is differentiable at @xmath75 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) and its derivative @xmath76 at @xmath75 is given by : @xmath77 in the same way , thanks to lemma [ lem1 ] , the function @xmath78 is differentiable ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath86 since @xmath87 , its first derivatives @xmath88 and @xmath89 have a trace on @xmath36 which belong to @xmath90 .",

    "now , we come back to the partial differential equation and use an intermediate schauder regularity result ( see @xcite or the remark after lemma 6.18 in @xcite ) to claim that if @xmath36 is of class @xmath101 , then the eigenfunction @xmath79 is @xmath102 and @xmath103 is @xmath104 . then , looking again to the o.d.e . and using the same kind of schauder s regularity result yields that @xmath105 .",

    "it would also give another proof of points 1 and 2 of theorem [ theo3 ] below .",
    "since we know that the minimizers are of class @xmath11 , we can now write rigorously the optimality condition . under variations of the boundary",
    "( replace @xmath17 by @xmath106 ) , the shape derivative of the perimeter is given by ( see section [ sec2.1 ] and ( * ? ? ?",

    "so , we have proved :    any minimizer @xmath17 satisfies @xmath114 is the curvature at point @xmath115 .    as a consequence , we can state some qualitative properties of the optimal domains .",

    "its boundary does not contain any segment .",
    "2 .   its boundary does not contain any arc of circle .",
    "its boundary contains exactly two points where the curvature vanishes .",
    "an easy consequence of hopf s lemma ( applied to each nodal domain ) is that the normal derivative of @xmath79 only vanishes on @xmath36 at points where the nodal line hits the boundary .",
    "now , we know ( see @xcite or @xcite ) that there are exactly two such points . then , the first and third items follow immediately from the `` over - determined '' condition .",
    "the second item has already been proved in a similar situation in @xcite .",

    "we define ( see @xcite ) by @xmath277 the solution of the elliptic problem @xmath278 if the compactness issue holds , there exists a measure @xmath82 and a sequence of vectors @xmath279 such that the resolvent operators @xmath280 converge strongly in @xmath281 to @xmath282 . since the perimeters of @xmath283 are uniformly bounded , we can define ( up to subsequences ) the sets @xmath284 as the limits of @xmath285 , and @xmath286 .",

    "assuming @xmath305 regularity , one can find the same kind of optimality condition as in with the mean curvature instead of the curvature . since , the gradient of @xmath79 still vanishes where the nodal surface hits the boundary , the mean curvature has to vanish and , according to the cylindrical symmetry , it is along a circle . therefore , one of the curvatures has to be negative at that point .",
    "the existence of an optimal domain for higher order eigenvalues under a perimeter constraint is only available when a geometric constraint @xmath306 is imposed ; we conjecture the existence of an optimal domain also when @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath14 but , at present , a proof of this fact is still missing .      we believe that optimal domains for problem @xmath307 are connected for every @xmath308 and every dimension @xmath0 .",
