    "<S> although extremely delicate , this noncontact form of friction is now measurable by a highly sensitive afm cantilever oscillating like a pendulum over the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pendulum configuration takes advantage of very small spring constants , typically in the order of mn / m . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding minimal detectable noncontact friction is extremely small , about @xmath2  kg / s , compared with @xmath3  kg / s of more conventional tuning fork tips ( see methods for details ) , which work at smaller distances , just outside the repulsive regime . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the pendulum to demonstrate a novel example of noncontact friction , occurring when the vibrating tip pumps integer 2@xmath1 slips onto the local surface phase of a cdw . </S>",
    "<S> + layered dichalchogenides have long been known for their phase transitions leading to picometer sized superstructure lattice distortions and corresponding new electronic periodicities in their low temperature ground state@xcite . among them , nbse@xmath4 ( with 2h stacking ) stands out as a material exhibiting bulk cdw below the long range order onset temperature @xmath5  k @xcite , as well as superconductivity below @xmath6  k. the cdw consists of a joint periodic lattice distortion ( pld ) and electron density modulation , with the same incommensurate periodicity close to @xmath7 in the layer plane , and a remarkably coherent phase , extending over hundreds of lattice spacings in clean samples . whereas in other isoelectronic compounds of that family , such as tas@xmath0 ( with 1 t stacking ) </S>",
    "<S> , the cdw has a clear connection with the fermi surface , thus leading to an insulating or near insulating state at low temperatures  @xcite , the driving force in nbse@xmath0 is now known to be different , not directly involving the fermi surface , as recently ascertained both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion of nbse@xmath0 is thus really only a pld . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless we stick to the commonly used term `` cdw '' to avoid language confusion .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured the friction force acting between an _ in situ _ cleaved nbse@xmath4 surface and a sharp silicon cantilever tip oscillating in the pendulum geometry as well as a qplus tuning fork tip . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously acquired the tip oscillation frequency @xmath8 and a dissipation signal @xmath9 under ultrahigh - vacuum ( uhv ) conditions and low temperatures of @xmath10  k , at which cdw and superconductivity coexist . as a function of tip - surface distance </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of afm data with theory allows us to conclude that the series of dissipation maxima is due to a hysteretic behavior of the cdw phase as the tip oscillates at specific distances where sharp local slips occur .     </S>",

    "<S> the giant noncontact friction maxima remain well defined even after careful compensation of contact potential difference ( cpd ) between tip and sample . </S>",

    "<S> understand in detail the effect of the tip on the cdw , and ultimately the source of the dissipation peaks , we describe the density deformation as a simple elastic system interacting with an extended perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> following well established literature @xcite , we describe the cdw through phase and amplitude order parameters , the latter assumed constant for small perturbations . the overall density ( ions and electrons ) </S>",
    "<S> takes the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the wavenumber and @xmath51 the constant amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the energy as a function of the order parameter @xmath52 for an external perturbing tip potential @xmath53 then reads : @xmath54 = \\int [ ( \\nabla \\phi(x))^2+v(x)\\rho(x)]\\mathrm{d}x.\\ ] ] to keep it simple , this description assumes a unidirectional cdw , but the same mechanism should hold in our tridirectional nbse@xmath0 experimental example . </S>",
    "<S> for a given external potential , the energy can be minimized to find the preferred phase shape along x. the main difference with previous treatments that were given for impurities @xcite is that in this case , due to the large size of the pendulum tip and swing , the potential @xmath53 may extend over lengths longer than the characteristic cdw lengthscale @xmath55 2.5 nm : this leads to new interesting effects . </S>",
    "<S> additional care needs to be taken in choosing the dimensionality of the system : while the relevant tip - related behavior of the cdw is along x and restricted to the surface , a full treatment will have to take into account the other dimensions , namely y in the surface plane , and z into the underlying bulk , in order to obtain a realistic shape for the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> while these aspects will be discussed in a separate work , here we will describe the effect in a simple one dimensional model , which retains all the necessary features without any of the complications connected with a higher dimensionality .    </S>",
    "<S> an important role in understanding the dissipation mechanism is played by the boundary conditions : while we will impose the phase to be fixed at the boundaries ( consistently with an overall pinned cdw as known experimentally ) , this value is only defined modulo @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the existence of qualitatively different solutions of the energy minimization problem , where ( along the main cdw direction ) the perturbation may lead to a phase change @xmath57 , with @xmath58 integer , between the pinned boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we will call @xmath58 the `` winding number '' of a given order parameter configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we minimize the energy in the subspace of one given winding number and observe its behavior as a function of the perturbation amplitude , controlled by the tip position above the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we show this energy in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] for a perturbation of lorentzian form @xmath59 , mimicking an approaching conical tip , as a function of the tip - sample distance @xmath60 .     for the elastic cdw model under the tip perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> solutions are reported for different winding number @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> the charge oscillation wavelength is @xmath64 and the position of the tip is indicated by the dashed vertical line . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 boundary conditions are fixed at @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as energy curves for different winding numbers sharply cross at specific distances , marked by dashed circles , we expect the cdw phase winding number to switch from one @xmath58 to the next @xmath66 type of deformation at these points . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as shown in the inset ( phase and density along the main cdw direction for different @xmath58 ) , these solutions present a qualitative difference , akin to a symmetry difference , making a smooth transition between the two impossible . passing through a crossover point </S>",
    "<S> will thus be accompanied by a hysteresis cycle in the tip mechanics , which explains the giant size of dissipation peaks despite the extremely low tip oscillation frequency as compared to dielectric relaxation frequency ( @xmath67 mhz ) measured in ac - conductivity experiments @xcite . to corroborate this picture , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the height of the dissipation peaks it would produce , proportional to the area of the hysteresis cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this area to be related to the angle between the energy curves @xmath68 and the average slope at the crossing point @xmath69 ( see the blow up in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the area of the hysteresis cycle while oscillating around this point will behave like @xmath70 , we see from the shape of the @xmath71 curves that the variation of these two parameters have opposite effects on the height of the peak as the tip approaches the surface , since a decreasing @xmath68 would decrease the hysteresis area , while an increasing @xmath69 would increase it . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a possible explanation of the non - monotonic peak intensity behavior observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> a full treatment of the cdw related dissipation materials should be followed by a more thorough theoretical treatment , which will be reported elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude here that the cdw phase slip model reproduces , at least qualitatively , the basic characteristics of the observed dissipation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important before closing to make connection with earlier work , both experimental @xcite , where a single dissipation peak was reported on nbse@xmath0 and srtio@xmath72 , and theoretical @xcite , where a collective resonance of spin - like centers was ingeniously invoked to explain it . </S>",
    "<S> our findings of a multiplicity of interaction force - controlled peaks in nbse@xmath0 , peaks systematically absent over nbs@xmath0 , suggests a different scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the train of peaks is perfectly reproducible and ubiquitous over well ordered surfaces and clean nbse@xmath0 bulks , making the existence and nature of these centers doubtful ( see fig .  4 of the supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature evolution of the peaks suggests instead a strong connection with the cdw . </S>",
    "<S> a correspondence between each peak and the local pumping of a cdw phase slip is made especially compelling by theoretically finding a first order energy crossing of states of the cdw with different winding numbers , implying the possibility of a mechanical hysteresis cycle even at the very low tip vibration frequency , where an alternative viscous dissipation could be barely detectable at best . in summary </S>",
    "<S> we believe we identified a promising mechanism  coupling of a slider to a collective phase  that is novel and deserves further experimental and theoretical study , extending to other systems with incommensurate bulk phases . </S>",
    "<S> it should apply in particular to genuine charge - density - wave and spin - density - wave materials , where the phase pumping should entail interesting surface flows of charge and spin under vibrating tips . </S>"
