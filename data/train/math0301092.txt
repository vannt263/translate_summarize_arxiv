    "invariant differential operators have a long history of importance and this is particularly the case for operators of laplace type .",

    "the cr invariant sub - laplacian of jerison - lee ( @xcite ) plays a role analogous to that of the conformal laplacian . in this paper",
    "we construct and study generalizations of the jerison - lee sub - laplacian which are cr analogues of the `` conformally invariant powers of the laplacian '' .",
    "one can deduce the existence of some such operators in the cr case from the conformal operators via the fefferman metric .",
    "fefferman @xcite showed that to a cr manifold @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 one can associate a conformal structure on a circle bundle @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "on conformal manifolds of dimension @xmath4 , the construction in @xcite produces for each @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 if @xmath4 is even , a conformally invariant natural differential operator , with principal part @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the space of conformal densities of weight @xmath5 .",
    "as we explain in the next section , on a cr manifold one can consider cr densities @xmath10 parametrized by @xmath11 .",
    "it is necessary that @xmath12 in order that @xmath10 be well - defined and this is always implicitly assumed .",

    "the operators @xmath14 for the fefferman metric can be shown to preserve the subspaces of cr densities and it is straightforward to calculate the principal part of the induced operators .",

    "there is a cr invariant natural differential operator @xmath17 whose principal part agrees with that of @xmath18 .    in the case that @xmath0 is a flat cr manifold , the hypothesis @xmath16 is unnecessary in this construction and in the flat case the operators @xmath19 exist for all @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .    in the conformal case , it is conjectured that if @xmath4 is even and @xmath22 , there is no natural operator with principal part @xmath8 mapping @xmath23 .",

    "the main ingredients are to define a tractor bundle , a complex vector bundle of rank @xmath32 over @xmath0 , together with a cr invariant connection , and an extension of this connection to a so - called tractor @xmath33 operator between weighted tractor bundles .",
    "we give a direct derivation of these in terms of the pseudohermitian tanaka - webster connection induced by a choice of contact form on @xmath0 , parallel to the derivation in @xcite in the projective and conformal cases . the tractor bundle and connection",
    "can also be derived from the cr cartan connection of cartan , tanaka , chern - moser , but we found it preferable to proceed directly , especially for the tractor @xmath33 calculus needed for the construction of the invariant operators .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further discussion and background about tractors .",
    "given this machinery , the construction of the operators @xmath31 follows a similar construction of eastwood and gover in the conformal case described in @xcite , involving iterating tractor @xmath33 s .",
    "the operators so constructed are _ strongly invariant _ in the sense of @xcite , i.e. they act invariantly not just on scalar densities but also on density - valued tractors .",

    "based on the situation in the conformal case ( @xcite ) , we do not anticipate that the operators @xmath19 and @xmath31 agree in general when both are defined . in fact , one must make choices of orderings and conjugations in defining @xmath31 , and one expects that different choices will in general lead to different operators . in the flat case",
    ", the tractor construction ( suitably interpreted ) also produces operators for all @xmath20 for which @xmath21 ; these do agree with the corresponding operators constructed via the fefferman metric .",

    "however , one can check that if @xmath41 , then the highest weight vector for the bundle @xmath10 is integral and non - singular .",
    "we are not aware that it has been established in general that a given specific operator constructed in @xcite has the desired principal part , or even is nonzero .",
    "however , it is possible to show that this is the case for all the operators which arise in three dimensional cr geometry",
    ". therefore , in three dimensions theorem  [ intromain ] and @xcite together yield the existence of a curved version of each of the flat operators :    for each @xmath20 satisfying @xmath42 , there is a natural differential operator on three dimensional cr manifolds mapping @xmath43 , whose principal part agrees with that of @xmath18 .",

    "we review the basic facts about cr structures and pseudohermitian geometry .",
    "we derive the tractor bundle , its connection , curvature , and the tractor @xmath33 operators in section [ tractors ] .",
    "these in turn are used in section [ maint ] to construct the operators @xmath31 . the main point in proving theorem [ intromain ]",
    "is that there are natural candidate operators which can be written down in terms of iterated tractor @xmath33 operators whose principal part is a multiple of @xmath18 and it must be determined when the multiple is nonzero .",
    "this leads to some numerology in calculating the multiple for flat space .",
    "finally in section [ amb ] we review lee s formulation of the fefferman metric and the gjms construction of the conformal operators and present the details of the proof of theorem  [ ambient ] .",
    "we show how this derivation via the fefferman metric can be reformulated in terms of fefferman s ambient metric and also in terms of the khler - einstein metric of cheng - yau when @xmath0 is a hypersurface in @xmath45 , and close with a brief discussion of @xmath46-curvature in the cr case .",
    "our presentation in this section in terms of the fefferman metric is influenced by the point of view explicated in @xcite . in sections",

    "for efficiency in expressing the transformation laws , we will denote covariant derivatives of @xmath172 with indices : @xmath173 .",
    "one observes first that if @xmath126 is an admissible coframe for @xmath76 , then @xmath174 defines an admissible coframe for @xmath171 .",
    "since the restrictions of @xmath175 and @xmath93 to @xmath52 agree , the components of a section @xmath137 of @xmath89 or its dual ( or conjugates or tensor products ) are the same in the two frames .",

    "a connection on a neighborhood of @xmath0 in @xmath45 associated to an arbitrary defining function @xmath484 was derived along with an explicit formula for @xmath521 in terms of this connection ( proposition 2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this together with the expressions for the curvature of this connection given in @xcite ( for commuting derivatives ) in principle enable explicit calculation of the obstruction operators in the curved case in terms of pseudohermitian curvature and torsion and their derivatives , and the transverse curvature @xmath511 and its derivatives . for general @xmath484 ,",
    "the obstruction operator was calculated in @xcite for @xmath35 and @xmath34 to be : @xmath551 where all the quantities involved are those for the pseudohermitian structure induced by @xmath484 on @xmath0 .",
    "the cr invariance of this operator was observed in @xcite , from which one concludes that for @xmath35 , @xmath37 is given by this formula for any choice of pseudohermitian structure .",
    "direct calculation shows that the operator @xmath552 discussed after the proof of proposition  [ flatgoody ] agrees with @xmath37 .    when @xmath553 , the invariant operators can also be characterized as obstructions , or equivalently as log term coefficients , when solving @xmath554 .",
    "this is analogous to the corresponding characterization of the conformal operators @xmath14 given in @xcite .",
    "the resolvent @xmath555 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath547 is a function on @xmath45 , then @xmath556 therefore , if @xmath557 and @xmath558 , then @xmath559 is the ( normalized ) obstruction to solving @xmath560 with @xmath561 smooth and @xmath562 on @xmath0 , where @xmath484 is chosen to solve @xmath545 .",
    "the relation is a direct calculation from .",

    "the construction of @xcite shows that the operator @xmath567 is natural in the strong sense that @xmath569 may be written as a linear combination of complete contractions of products of covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor of a representative for the conformal structure with covariant derivatives of @xmath137 , with coefficients which are rational in the dimension @xmath4 .",
    "also , the zeroth order term of @xmath567 may be written as @xmath570 for a scalar riemannian invariant @xmath571 with coefficients which are rational in @xmath4 and regular at @xmath572 .",

    "if @xmath0 is a pseudohermitian manifold , the @xmath46-curvature of its fefferman metric is invariant under rotations , so defines a function on @xmath0 which we denote by @xmath576 .",
    "it is then natural to define the cr @xmath46-curvature of @xmath577 by @xmath578 .",

    "using lee s formulae for @xmath584 , @xmath583 , and @xmath585 , it is straightforward to calculate this for the fefferman metric ; one obtains that the @xmath46-curvature for 3-dimensional cr manifolds is given by : @xmath586 this quantity was introduced by hirachi @xcite , who showed that it gives the coefficient of the @xmath452 term in the szeg kernel .",

    "the total @xmath46-curvature @xmath587 is an interesting invariant of a compact conformal manifold .",
    "however , since the expression in is a divergence , it follows that we have @xmath588 for the corresponding integral for 3-dimensional cr manifolds .",
    "also , the @xmath46-curvature vanishes identically for a hypersurface in @xmath45 with pseudohermitian structure induced by a solution of @xmath589 . a proof of this fact using a characterization of @xmath46-curvature in terms of the ambient metric is given in @xcite .",
