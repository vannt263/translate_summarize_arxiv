    "the presence of dark matter in the universe has been invoked to explain a number of phenomena , the rotation curves of galaxies@xcite-@xcite the apparent mass of galactic clusters@xcite and the observed expansion of the universe .",
    "many attempts to detect this conjectured matter are under way but at the moment there is no direct observation of it . in this paper",
    "we present a model with a modified version of gravity that can accommodate these points in a relatively straightforward way .",

    "the theory , which is geometrical in character , is perfectly covariant , locally lorentz invariant and satisfies the equivalence principle .",

    "bi - metric theories ran into difficulties when , as then formulated , they appeared to be inconsistent with the tests of general relativity @xcite .",

    "of course vsl is built into bi - metric theories .",
    "this will be important in applying the model to early universe studies .",
    "however in this paper we concentrate on those implications of our theory for the gravitational interaction of matter that provide an explanation of the current state of the universe without recourse to dark matter .",
    "our proposal is to introduce into the space - time manifold , two vierbein bundles .",
    "each bundle supports its own metric .",
    "one is associated with matter and the other with ( underlying ) gravity .",
    "the matter vierbein can be strained and scaled relative to the gravitational vierbein .",
    "the dynamics of the theory includes this straining and scaling as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the justification for introducing these new effects is ultimately in the results that emerge .",
    "however if dark matter is not present some modification of gravity or dynamics is essential . we choose to modify gravity in a way that permits the introduction of a galactic scale , something that is impossible with standard general relativity .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained from an action comprising three parts , a gravitational term @xmath0 , of the standard curvature form , a matter term @xmath1 , of the standard form based on the matter metric , and a linking action @xmath2 , that depends on the variables that determine the relationship between the two vierbein bundles .",

    "disparities in the visible and dark matter distributions would tend to destroy this alignment . in our theory of course , the distribution of dark matter is identical to that of visible matter of which it is merely a reflection .",
    "there is no room for any bias between visible and dark matter fluctuations .",
    "we will see later that the re - interpretation of dark matter as an enhancement of the newtonian constant at large scales extends also to the dynamics of the expanding universe .      on a galactic scale",
    "we are concerned with the rotation curves of galaxies . the apparent asymptotic flatness of many of these curves is usually taken as the most direct evidence for dark matter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our explanation rests on the modification of the gravitational interaction described above .",
    "it turns out that by choosing a value for @xmath98 in the range suggested by large scale dynamics it is possible , using a disk model , appropriate for certain spiral galaxies , to compute rotation curves that exhibit the features of observed rotation curves .",
    "as an example we construct a model galaxy with a thin disk of surface density (r)=_de^-a_dr",
    ". the mass of the disk is @xmath100  .",
    "the gravitational potential in the plane of the galaxy is ( r)=- d^2e^-a_dr(1-e^-m|-| )  , and the tangential rotational velocity , @xmath101 , is given by v^2=.(r)= d^2e^-a_dr.(1-e^-m|-| )  .",
    "the galaxy ngc 3198 has a well measured rotation curve and it is accepted that a simple exponential disk model gives a good account of its luminosity distribution @xcite .",
    "we assume a mass distribution with the same exponential shape . in fig [ ngc3198 ]",
    "we show the resulting rotation curve where we have chosen the galaxy parameters to be @xmath102 and @xmath103 , these are quite close to the values of a previous analysis @xcite .",
    "the theory parameters are chosen to be @xmath104 and @xmath105 or @xmath106 kpc .",
    "we stress that these parameters are not a best fit but merely the result of eyeball exploration .",
    "however it is not easy to reduce the value of @xmath98 value by much and obtain a convincing shape .",
    "it is encouraging that @xmath98 does lie in the range we anticipated from our discussion of extragalactic structure .",
    "the fig [ ngc3198 ] also shows the standard newtonian curve for the assumed mass distribution .",
    "the difference between the two curves is normally attributed to dark matter . here",
    "we achieve the same effect by means of our modified gravity theory .",
    "fig [ ngc3198l ] shows the extrapolation of the curve to larger radius .",
    "there is clearly a beginning of a fall - off around 90 - 100 kpc although the there is still substantial rotational velocity out to 400 kpc .",
    "the rotation curve becomes newtonian but with an enhanced gravitational coupling v  .",
    "of course the challenge to our theory is to fit all galactic rotation curves simultaneously with common values for @xmath44 and @xmath98   and plausible masses and and mass distributions for the galaxies .",
    "this is no easy task since many galaxies have a more complicated structure than ngc3198 and detailed modelling will be required to determine the adequacy of our theoretical predicitions .",
    "we intend to pursue this task in the future .",
    "however one prediction of the theory does not require such a detailed attack .",
    "we predict that _ all _ galactic rotation curves will fall away in the range 100 - 200 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "measurements in this range and beyond would be a direct test of our ideas .",
    "our proposal of a galactic scale determining the shapes of rotation curves is in conflict with the construction of a proposed universal scaling curve for galaxies @xcite .",
    "this approach takes the optical radius of the galaxy as the significant length scale and uses a statistical approach to establish well defined rotation curves .",
    "we are proposing a model in which the ratio of the optical radius to the galactic scale is the significant quantity for establishing the shape of rotation curves .",
    "the statistical approach deployed in @xcite , which superimposes results from galaxies of different sizes , is therefore not open to us .",
    "it may well be however that the detailed modelling required to test our theory will provide an equally good description of actual galactic rotation curves .",
    "more importantly , if a common scale for the underlying structure of all galaxies were established it holds out the prospect of better distance measurements and hence the possibility of measuring the hubble constant with more certainty .",
    "finally we wish to show that when the matter density is small as in the present epoch , the expansion of the universe is controlled by the standard equations of general relativity but with newton s constant , @xmath4 , replaced by the enhanced constant @xmath33  .",
    "in other words the dark matter component required to relate the visible matter to the observed hubble constant is again supplied by the enhancement mechanism .",
    "of course a complete reconciliation of the equations with observation requires a contribution to the energy density from the cosmological constant .",
    "this necessity can be catered for also in our theory .    to apply our theory",
    "we take the usual starting point that the spatial sections of the universe are isotropic and homogeneous . in the present approach",
    "we meet these requirements by assuming that there exist basis vierbein fields , @xmath107 such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110  .",
    "we choose our coordinates so that @xmath111 is constant in space - time and @xmath107 depends only on coordinates on the spatial section when @xmath110  .",
    "we finally fix the nature of the space - time model by choosing structure constants @xmath112 so that _ e_a-_e_a =- f_bcae_^  be_^  c  .",
    "of course @xmath112 vanishes if any of the suffixes is 0 ( timelike ) .",
    "for a spatially flat universe all structure constants have the value zero . for a universe of positive spatial curvature the spatial constants @xmath113 , where 2 is a convenient normalization , and for a negatively curved universe @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an arbitrary unit three - vector .",
    "we construct the expanding universe by choosing the gravitational vierbein to have the form e_a = a_ae_a  , where a_0=1  a_i = a(t )  , a similar structure is maintained for the matter vierbein by requiring the transformation matrix @xmath12 to be diagonal . that is ( we equivalence the labels @xmath6 and @xmath10 in the obvious way ) ,",
    "_ = e^_ae_a=_ae_a   _ a=_aa_ae^  , where @xmath116 and @xmath117  .",
    "the requirement that @xmath71 implies that @xmath118  .    using the above information and eq([vbcon1 ] )",
    "we find that _ i0j=-_ij0=_ij  , and _",
    "ijk=-(f_ijk+f_kij+f_kji )  . all other components vanish .",
    "a similar structure is found for @xmath119  . from eq([vbcon2 ] ) we obtain _",
    "i0j=-_ij0=_ij  , where e=1-(2 - - )  , and _",
    "ijk=_ijk  .    from eq([curv1",
    "] ) we find for the relevant components of the curvature tensor r_00=-_t ( )  , and @xmath120 if we evaluate this expression for the three curvature cases we find r_ij=(_t ( ) + 2()^2+)_ij  , where conventionally @xmath121 according as the spatial curvature is zero , positive or negative .",
    "we also have from eq([strcur ] ) j_tabj_t^  ba=()^2  , and j_iabj_j^  ba=()^2 ( 2 - -)_ij  .    if we denote the matter energy density and pressure by @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively , then from eq([eqm1 ] ) we obtain @xmath124 and @xmath125 from eq([eqm2 ] ) we find @xmath126 finally from eq([eqm5 ] ) we obtain + + m^2=-8fe^4(-3p )  .",
    "[ neqm4 ]    eq([neqm1 ] ) and eq([neqm2 ] ) can be combined to eliminate the second derivative in @xmath127  .",
    "@xmath128 if we multiply this equation by @xmath129 and differentiate with repect to @xmath127 we can use the above equations of motion to deduce that = ( -3 - 3)(+p )  .",
    "this is easily re - expressed as _",
    "t()+p_t ( )  , or _",
    "t(^3)+p_t(^3 )  , [ consv ] where @xmath130 is the cosmic radius parameter appropriate to matter . eq([consv ] ) is therefore the standard equation for the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor in this special case , as we should have expected .",
    "the above equations are rather complicated but can be simplified if we ask how they might be applied to our expanding universe in which the pressure vanishes and the matter density is low and getting lower . in the absence of matter eq([neqm5 ] ) has a solution for which @xmath131  . for weak density",
    "we assume that there is a solution for which @xmath132  .",
    "we have then as a leading approximation + + m^2=-8f  .",
    "the form of this equation suggests that , ignoring transients , the solution is to a good approximation = -=-  .",
    "we expect then that @xmath36 will remain @xmath133  . if we set @xmath134 and omit all terms @xmath135 then @xmath136 and eq([neqm4 ] ) becomes + 3 + ( m^2 - 8()^2)=-6f  .",
    "again we expect there to be a solution @xmath137  .",
    "if now we neglect all terms @xmath138 we obtain the equations ( ) ^2+=(+_cc )  , where the energy density associated with the cosmological constant , @xmath139 is given by _",
    "cc=(1- ) = ( -1 )  . and _ t(a^3)=0",
    ". these are the standard equations for the expanding universe but with newton s constant @xmath4 replaced by the enhanced constant @xmath33  . to lowest order in @xmath122 the parameter @xmath127 is also the proper time of comoving matter in its own metric since the two metrics coincide under these circumstances .",
    "it follows that hubble s constant @xmath140 and the current deceleration parameter is @xmath141 and that the critical density for a flat universe is _",
    "c==(1- )  .",
    "so @xmath142 in our theory is between one tenth and one twentieth the value appropriate to standard general relativity .",
    "this brings it within range of visible matter @xcite .",
    "in fact recent measurements of distant supernovae @xcite lead to an estimate of @xmath143 that suggests @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( assuming a flat universe @xcite ) with the further implication that in the present theory , visible matter may support the current expansion of the universe albeit with the help of a cosmological constant .",
    "in this paper we have constructed a modified theory of gravity that fits all the standard tests of general relativity that can be made on the scale of the solar system including the bending of light by the sun , time delay measurements and the precession of mercury s orbit .",
    "the theory is a bi - metric theory of a novel kind with a very geometrical structure .",
    "it has the flexibility to permit the introduction of a galactic length - scale of roughly 30 kpc .",
    "gravitational effects of matter at distances below the galactic scale , in the solar system for example , are of a conventional kind and of a strength determined by newton s constant , @xmath4  .",
    "this outcome is achieved in the theory as the result of a competition between two gravitational effects , a strong attraction and a repulsion that is nearly as strong . over the range of the galactic scale",
    "the theory allows the repulsion to fade out exponentially leaving the much stronger underlying gravity to show through .",
    "the gravitational effects of matter on this large scale are also conventional in character but of a strength determined by the much stronger underlying gravitational constant @xmath146  .",
    "these results are consistent with observations of galactic clusters and also apply to the expansion of the universe as a whole . as a result",
    "the critical density for a flat universe is between one tenth and one twentieth of the value calculated in general relativity .",
    "this makes it more plausible that visible baryonic matter can support the expansion of the universe without dark matter , though supplemented by a cosmological constant .",
    "the theory provides a natural explanation for the tendency of dark matter to follow the distribution of visible matter since the former is simply an amplification of the latter .",
    "dark matter does not have a separate dynamics of its own . on this basis",
    "the apparent dark matter is not in any way biased in its fluctuation structure relative to visible matter .",
    "we showed that at least for the galaxy ngc3198 the theory can reproduce the rotation curve out to 30 kpc ( the end of the measured range ) equally as well as dark matter models .",
    "the theory also predicts that the rotation curve will fall away in the 100 - 200 kpc range and eventually tend to a standard inverse square root of distance behaviour but with an apparent mass @xmath147 times the expected mass of the galaxy ( @xmath148 for ngc3198 ) if the conventional newtonian constant is used for the estimate .",
    "our theory however assigns the expected mass but uses the enhanced value for the gravitational constant appropriate at extra - galactic distances .",
    "this phenomenon should appear for all galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important for the theory to test rotation curves at distances of @xmath149 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "it is also important to test the effectiveness of the theory in a range of galaxies and to arrive at a consistent picture with a common set of gravitational parameters .",
    "this task requires a good understanding of the structure of individual galaxies and and accurate knowledge of their distance .",
    "however we note that the establishment of a fixed scale associated with all galaxies would be of considerable help in establishing galactic distances .",
    "in addition to the incomplete phenomenological analyses discussed above there are many issues yet to be explored in our bi - metric theory .",
    "of particular importance are the development of density fluctations , dynamics and formation of galaxies using the modified gravitational law , and evolution of the early universe . in this last context",
    "the ability of bi - metric theories to support anomalous propagation of signals ( vsl phenomena ) will be of great importance .",
    "the existence within the theory of black holes is also a topic that it would be very interesting to resolve . on intuitive grounds it seems reasonable to suppose that black holes will exist in our theory but the nature of the horizon",
    "may be more complicated than in general relativity because of its double light - cone structure .",
