    "the nuclear double @xmath1-decay process is widely considered @xcite as one of the most important sources of information about fundamental issues , such as lepton number nonconservation and massive neutrinos , that can be used to test the standard model .    theoretically , a condition to obtain reliable estimates for the limits of the double @xmath1-decay half - lives is that the nuclear structure involved in the process through the nuclear matrix elements can be calculated correctly .",
    "the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pnqrpa or qrpa in short ) is one of the most reliable and extended microscopic approximations for calculating the correlated wave functions involved in @xmath1 and double @xmath1 decay processes .",
    "the method was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the @xmath2 strength .",
    "it was developed on spherical single - particle wave functions and energies with pairing and residual interactions .",
    "the qrpa method was also successfully applied to the description of double @xmath1-decay @xcite after the inclusion of a particle - particle ( @xmath3 ) residual interaction , in addition to the particle - hole ( @xmath4 ) usual channel . many more extensions of the qrpa method have been proposed in the literature , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "an extension of the pnqrpa method to deal with deformed nuclei was done in ref .",

    "subsequent extensions including woods - saxon type potentials @xcite , residual interactions in the particle - particle channel @xcite , selfconsistent deformed hartree - fock mean fields with consistent residual interactions @xcite and selfconsistent approaches in spherical neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , can also be found in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of deformation on the double @xmath1-decay processes has not been sufficiently studied @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , ground state and @xmath2-decay properties of exotic nuclei were studied on the basis of a deformed selfconsistent hf+bcs+qrpa calculation with density dependent effective interactions of skyrme type .",
    "this is a well founded approach that has been very successful in the description of spherical and deformed nuclei within the valley of stability @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend those calculations to the study of the dependence on deformation of the single @xmath1 branches that build up the double @xmath1 process .",
    "we focus on the example of the double @xmath1-decay of @xmath0ge and study @xmath5 gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions to the intermediate nucleus as well as the @xmath6 gamow - teller transitions of the daughter nucleus @xmath0se to the same intermediate nucleus .",
    "we discuss the similarities and differences of using different single particle mean fields of woods - saxon ( ws ) and hartree - fock ( hf ) types .    in sect .",

    "the conclusions are given in sect .",
    "in this section we describe the qrpa formalism used in this work , which is based on two different assumptions for the deformed mean field , a woods - saxon potential and a selfconsistent mean field obtained from a hartree - fock procedure with skyrme forces .    in the first approach we use a deformed ws potential with axial symmetry to generate single particle energies and wave functions .",
    "the parameters of this potential are taken from the work of tanaka _ et al .",
    "this parametrization was proposed originally for spherical nuclei ranging from @xmath7o to @xmath8pb , but the derived isospin dependence of the parameters allows an extension to deformed nuclei as well .",
    "previous qrpa calculations have shown that this parametrization provides realistic levels also for deformed nuclei and good results on @xmath9 excitations were obtained @xcite for nuclei in various mass regions as well .    in these calculations ,",
    "the quadrupole deformation of the ws potential @xmath10 is usually determined by fitting the microscopically calculated ground state quadrupole moment to the corresponding experimental value .",
    "the hexadecapole deformation @xmath11 is expected to be small for these nuclei and we assume it is equal to zero .    on the other hand , we also perform selfconsistent microscopic calculations based on a deformed hf method with density - dependent skyrme interactions .",
    "we consider in this paper the force sk3 @xcite and the force sg2 @xcite that has been successfully tested against spin and isospin excitations in spherical @xcite and deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "for the solution of the hf equations we follow the mcmaster procedure that is based in the formalism developed in ref . @xcite as described in ref .",
    "time reversal and axial symmetry are also assumed here .    in both schemes , ws and hf ,",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , which are written in terms of laguerre and hermite polynomials .",
    "the single - particle states @xmath12 and their time reversed @xmath13 are characterized by the eigenvalues @xmath14 of @xmath15 , parity @xmath16 , and energy @xmath17    @xmath18    with @xmath19 , and    @xmath20    with @xmath21 . for each @xmath22",

    "for @xmath0ge we obtain @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev and for @xmath0se we obtain @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 mev .    therefore , at the quasiparticle mean field level , we can observe several differences with respect to the treatment of the mean field in terms of hf or ws potentials .",
    "the most important is that the quadrupole deformation of the ground state is determined selfconsistently in hf and no explicit input parameter is needed .",
    "other differences come from the structure of the two - body density - dependent skyrme force that contains terms absent in the ws potential , such as a spin - spin interaction in the selfconsistent mean field through the spin exchange operators of the skyrme force .",
    "now , we add to the mean field a spin - isospin residual interaction , which is expected to be the most important residual interaction to describe gt transitions .",
    "this interaction contains two parts . a particle - hole part , which is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and a particle - particle part , which is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath44 coupling channel .    @xmath45    @xmath46    the two forces @xmath4 and @xmath3 are defined with a positive and a negative sign , respectively , according to their repulsive and attractive character , so that the coupling strengths @xmath47 and @xmath48 take positive values .",

    "we guarantee that the intrinsic deformations of the ground state are similar in hf and ws and therefore the differences in their predictions will have their origin in the structure of mean fields having the same deformation .",

    "the distributions of the gt strength have been folded with breit - wigner functions of 1 mev width to facilitate the comparison among the various calculations , so that the original discrete spectrum is transformed into a continuous profile .",
    "these distributions are given in units of @xmath96 and one should keep in mind that a quenching of the @xmath97 factor , typically @xmath98 , is expected on the basis of the observed quenching in charge exchange reactions .",

    "to make the discussion meaningful we show the results obtained at the two - quasiparticle level without including the spin - isospin residual interactions . in these figures",
    "we can see the @xmath99 and @xmath100 strength distributions in the upper and lower panels , respectively .",
    "one should notice that the relevant strength distributions for the double @xmath1-decay of @xmath0ge , as it can be seen schematically in fig .",
    "4 , are the @xmath99 distribution of the parent @xmath0ge and the @xmath100 distribution of daughter @xmath0se , but for completeness we show both distributions for each nucleus .",
    "solid lines in figs .",
    "2 and 3 correspond to the results obtained from the skyrme force sg2 within a hf scheme , dashed lines correspond to the results obtained with the ws potential .",
    "the deformation of the mean fields are as indicated in table 1 , using the prolate shape in @xmath0se .",
    "pairing correlations are included in hf and ws cases in a similar way with the gap parameters for neutrons and protons mentioned earlier .",
    "then , the only source of discrepancy between hf and ws comes from the different single particle wave functions and energies .    in general , we observe that ws and hf produce a similar structure of three peaks in the @xmath99 profiles of @xmath0ge and @xmath0se , although the ws results are somewhat displaced to lower energies with respect to the hf peaks .",
    "the strengths contained in the peaks are also comparable . in the case of the @xmath100 distributions ,",
    "we first observe the different scale , which is about one order of magnitude lower than the @xmath99 scale .",
    "this is a consequence of the pauli blocking .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ mspm ] ) that while the occupation amplitudes @xmath101 and @xmath102 favor @xmath103 strengths , they are very small factors in @xmath104 strengths when connecting similar proton and neutron states .",
    "the difference between total @xmath99 and @xmath100 strengths ( ikeda sum rule ( [ ikedaeq ] ) , which is fulfilled in our calculations ) , is a large number @xmath105 in @xmath0ge and @xmath106 in @xmath0se , reflecting the different magnitude of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 strengths shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the profiles of the @xmath100 distributions with ws and hf present some discrepancies that are amplified by the scale . in particular , it is remarkable the large strength produced by ws in the region of high excitation energies in @xmath0ge that we discuss later in terms of the single particle wave functions .    in order to clarify the origin of the various peaks in the strength distributions we have added in fig .",
    "2 labels showing some of the leading transitions generating the strength .",
    "the labels stand for @xmath107 of the orbitals connected by the spin operator in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and a number that identifies the transition . in both cases , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the same type of transitions",
    "are connected by the gt operator but the occupation probabilities , weighting the matrix elements , enhance or reduce them accordingly .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "2 that the structure of the profiles in both ws and hf are generated by the same type of gt transitions .",
    "this can be further illustrated by looking at fig .",
    "5 , where we show the single particle energies for protons and neutrons obtained in hf(sg2 ) and ws in @xmath0ge . in the left part of the figure corresponding to the hf calculation we have plotted the occupation probabilities @xmath108 and @xmath109 and the fermi energies @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we can also see for completeness the spherical levels labeled by their @xmath112 values .",
    "we have indicated by arrows the most relevant gamow - teller transitions in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions that are labeled by the same numbers used in fig . 2 to identify the peaks .",
    "to be more precise , we can see in table 2 the correspondence between these labels and the transitions connecting the proton and neutron states using the asymptotic quantum number notation @xmath113k^\\pi$ ] .",
    "now , looking at fig .",
    "2 , we can understand that the two first peaks in @xmath99 are generated mainly by transitions between neutrons and protons dominated by contributions within the @xmath114 shell and that the third peak is generated by transitions between neutrons and protons with main contributions coming from the @xmath115 shell .",
    "the different energies of the peaks are due to the different concentration of energy levels in hf and ws .    in the case of @xmath100 , the strength below 8 mev",
    "is mainly generated by transitions within the @xmath114 shells .",
    "beyond 8 mev the strength , which is negligible in hf , is generated by transitions between the proton shell @xmath116 and the neutron shell @xmath115 as well as between the proton shell @xmath114 and the neutron shell @xmath117 , always understood as the main components of the wave functions .",
    "then , very deep inside protons @xmath118 are connected with very unoccupied neutron states @xmath119 , giving rise to maximum occupation factors .",
    "the different behavior in this high energy region between hf and ws is therefore due , other factors like deformation and occupations being equal , to the structure of the deformed orbitals .    to illustrate the role of the different single particle wave functions in the development of the peak structure , we consider in detail the case of the last peak observed in the @xmath100 distribution of the ws potential .",
    "as we can see it is mainly due to a transition between the proton state @xmath120 $ ] in the @xmath114 shell with @xmath121 and the neutron state @xmath122 $ ] in the @xmath117 shell with @xmath123 .",
    "the structure of the single particle wave functions , according to the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ sp_i ] ) , of these two states in the cases of hf and ws can be seen in table 3 . with these coefficients",
    "we can construct the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ sig1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting strength is almost two orders of magnitude in favor of ws , which explains the huge discrepancy observed between ws and hf in the higher energy domain .    nevertheless , these discrepancies are smaller in the case of the @xmath100 of @xmath0se , which is the relevant branch for the double @xmath1-decay of the parent nucleus @xmath0ge .    figures 6 and 7 contain the strength distributions obtained from qrpa calculations for @xmath0ge and @xmath0se , respectively . the data in fig . 6 are from ref .",
    "@xcite and were obtained from charge exchange @xmath0ge(p , n)@xmath0as reactions . the thick line in fig .",
    "6 corresponds to these data folded by the same procedure used for the theoretical results . the data in fig .",
    "7 and 8 are from ref .",
    "@xcite and were obtained from charge exchange @xmath0se(n , p)@xmath0as reactions .",
    "the coupling constants of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 residual interactions used in figs 6 - 8 are from ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of ws . in our case with @xmath124 , these parameters are @xmath125 mev and @xmath126 mev . in the case of the hf calculations with",
    "the skyrme forces sk3 and sg2 better agreement with the measured location of the @xmath99 resonance in @xmath0ge is obtained with a somewhat smaller value of the @xmath4 strength .",
    "the curves shown in figs .",
    "6 - 8 for the hf results have been obtained using @xmath127 mev and the same @xmath126 mev .    in fig .",
    "6 we have used the prolate deformations for @xmath0ge given in table 1 .",
    "we can see that ws follows the structure of the experimental @xmath99 strength distribution with two peaks at low energies ( @xmath1285 and 8 mev ) and the resonance at 11 mev .",
    "the hf calculations produce also a few peaks at low excitation energies and a resonance between 10 and 13 mev .",
    "we can see that the structure of the strength distributions is qualitatively similar for the two skyrme forces and that the difference with the ws curves can be traced back to the discrepancies found at the two quasiparticle level .",
    "7 contains similar calculations for @xmath0se .",
    "the coupling strengths of the residual forces are as indicated for @xmath0ge .",
    "the results in the hf cases are obtained with the oblate deformation of @xmath0se that produces the absolute minimum of the energy and agrees better with the experimental quadrupole moment .",
    "in general , comparison with experiment is reasonable and should not be stressed too much since , as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental results , especially above 6 mev , must be considered to be of a qualitative nature only .",
    "the role of the residual interactions on the gt strengths was already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the repulsive @xmath4 force introduces two types of effects : a shift of the gt strength to higher excitation energies with the corresponding displacement of the position of the gt resonance and a reduction of the total gt strength .",
    "the residual @xmath3 , being an attractive force , shifts the strength to lower excitation energies , reducing the total gt strength as well . also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite was the effect of the bcs correlations on the gt strength distribution .",
    "the main effect of pairing correlations is to create new transitions that are forbidden in the absence of such correlations .",
    "the main effect of increasing the fermi diffuseness is to smooth out the profile of the gt strength distribution , increasing the strength at high energies and decreasing the strength at low energies .",
    "the role of deformation was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that the gt strength distributions corresponding to deformed nuclear shapes are much more fragmented than the corresponding spherical ones , as it is clear because deformation breaks down the degeneracy of the spherical shells .",
    "it was also shown that the crossing of deformed energy levels that depends on the magnitude of the quadrupole deformation as well as on the oblate or prolate character , may lead to sizable differences between the gt strength distributions corresponding to different shapes .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "8 the gt strength distributions in @xmath0se obtained from spherical , prolate and oblate shapes .",
    "they correspond to qrpa calculations performed with the hf basis obtained with the force sk3 . in the spherical case , the only possible transitions ( see fig .",
    "5 ) are those connecting spherical @xmath112 partners with @xmath129 , in allowed approximation .",
    "therefore , there is gt strength only at a few excitation energies .",
    "the strength we observe in fig .",
    "8 is the result of the folding procedure performed at these energies . on the other hand , in the deformed cases we can observe a stronger fragmentation , which is the result of all possible connections among the deformed states ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . thus ,",
    "the spherical peaks become broader when deformation is present .",
    "we can see in table 4 the total gt strengths in @xmath0se contained below an energy cut of 60 mev .",
    "we show the results obtained for @xmath6 and @xmath5 strengths with oblate , spherical , and prolate shapes .",
    "the ikeda sum rule @xmath106 , is fulfilled at this energy cut within a @xmath130 accuracy .",
    "we can see from table 4 that deformation increases both @xmath6 and @xmath5 strengths in a similar amount in order to preserve the ikeda sum rule ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "we also show for comparison the results obtained in 2qp approximation .",
    "we can see the reduction of the strength introduced by the qrpa correlations , which is again similar in absolute terms for @xmath6 and @xmath5 strengths in order to keep the ikeda sum rule conserved in qrpa .",
    "since the @xmath5 strength is much larger than the @xmath6 strength , the relative effect of the qrpa correlations is much stronger for @xmath6 , where the total strength is reduced by a 50% .    comparing the results for @xmath0se obtained at different deformations with the selfconsistent mean fields ( hf with sk3 ) in fig .",
    "8 and table 4 , we see that there is a strong dependence on deformation in the strength distributions as a function of the energy .",
    "however , the total strength does not depend so much on deformation .",
    "there is an increase of a few percent in going from the spherical to the oblate and prolate shapes .",
    "the latter observation enters in contradiction with su(3 ) and shell model calculations by previous authors @xcite on the dependence on deformation of the gt strengths in @xmath132ne and @xmath133ti .",
    "we think that this is due to the much larger and richer single particle basis used in the present calculations . in our case each single particle state contains mixtures from many harmonic oscillator shells ( up to @xmath26 ) , while in the above mentioned calculations @xcite , the single particle basis is restricted to a single harmonic oscillator major shell ( the @xmath134 shell in @xmath132ne and the @xmath135 shell in @xmath133ti ) . on the other hand , one may question whether in the deformed cases the total strengths calculated here may contain spurious contributions from higher angular momentum components in the initial and final nuclear wave functions . since the matrix elements of the transition operator , which is a dipole tensor operator , are taken between the states considered in the laboratory frame ( see eq .",
    "( [ bgt ] ) ) , the effect of angular momentum projection is to a large extent taken into account .",
    "we have calculated an upper bound to such contributions using angular momentum projection techniques @xcite .",
    "we find that this upper bound is less than @xmath136 ( @xmath137 , with @xmath138 for the oblate shape in @xmath0se ) .",
    "thus , exact angular momentum projection would not wash out the small increase of the total strength with deformation .",
    "we have studied the gt strength distributions for the two decay branches @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the double @xmath1-decay of @xmath0ge .",
    "this has been done within a deformed qrpa formalism , which includes @xmath4 and @xmath3 separable residual interactions .",
    "the quasiparticle mean field includes pairing correlations in bcs approximation and it is generated by two different methods , a deformed hf approach with skyrme interactions and a phenomenological deformed ws potential .",
    "one difference is that with hf and sk3 we get the minimum and stable deformation for @xmath0se to be oblate , while the prolate minimum is comparable to that obtained with ws and it is higher in energy .",
    "we have studied the similarities and differences observed in the gt strength distributions with these two methods . among the similarities we can mention the structure of peaks found in the strength distributions and among the differences the displacement in the excitation energies found between hf and ws results .",
    "this discrepancy has its origin in the structure of the single particle wave functions and energies generated by the deformed mean fields .",
    "this also implies that different mean fields require different residual interactions to reproduce the experimental gt resonances .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain reliable gt strength distributions and consequently reliable estimates for double @xmath1-decay half - lives , it is important to have not only the proper residual interactions but also a good deformed single particle basis as a starting point . in the case of hf",
    "we have seen that standard skyrme forces , such as sg2 or sk3 , give a good description of the gt strength distributions provided the proper residual interactions are included . even though the selfconsistent hf approach is a more sophisticated type of calculation , the deformed ws potential produces comparable results when the parameters of the potential and the residual interactions for a given mass region are chosen properly .",
