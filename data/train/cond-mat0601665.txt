    "generalization of the thermostatistics is known to be based on the deformation procedure of both logarithm and exponential @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to introduce these functions into the thermostatistics scheme is to consider the equation of motion for dimensionless volume @xmath6 of the supported phase space ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 being dirac - planck constant and particle number ) . in the course of evolution of the ensemble with statistical weight @xmath9 and entropy @xmath10 , the variation rate of the phase space volume",
    "is governed by the following equation @xcite @xmath11 from this , one follows the relation @xmath12 whose integration gives the entropy related to the whole statistical weight @xmath13 : @xmath14 here , we take into account that entropy of a single state @xmath15 vanishes .    in the case of the smooth phase space , one has trivial relation @xmath16 whose insertion into the relation ( [ 2 ] ) derives to the boltzmann entropy @xmath17",
    ". however , complex systems has fractal phase space with the dimension @xmath18 , so that relation between the statistical weight and the corresponding volume should be replaced by the power - law dependence @xmath19 where reduced fractal dimension @xmath20 is introduced .",
    "insertion of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) into integral ( [ 2 ] ) gives the expression @xmath21 which is reduced to the tsallis logarithm @xmath22 where non - additivity parameter @xmath23 is replaced by inverted value @xmath24 of the reduced fractal dimension @xmath0 of the phase space .",
    "naturally , this expression is reduced to the boltzmann entropy in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "adduced formalism is based on the proposition that the phase space is a monofractal determined by single dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this letter is to generalize tsallis thermostatistics onto the multifractal phase space with a spectrum @xmath2 .",
    "such a generalization for arbitrary distribution @xmath2 is carried out in section 2 .",
    "discussion in section 3 shows that overall representation of the thermostatistics based on the multifractal phase space demands of the consistent consideration of input , escort and ` physical ' distributions .",
    "an optimization of the spectrum @xmath2 is considered in section 4 .",
    "section 5 concludes our treatment .",
    "according to the usual recipe @xcite , the passage to multidractal phase space is provided with replacement of the power function ( [ 3 ] ) by the expression @xmath26 where @xmath23 is multifractal index , multiplier @xmath27 takes into account specific number of monofractals with dimension @xmath0 within the multifractal . as a result , the statistical weight",
    ", playing the role of the multifractal measure , takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density distribution over dimensions @xmath0 . using the method of steepest descent , we arrive at the modified power law @xmath30 which generalizes the simplest relation ( [ 3 ] ) due to replacement of the bare fractal dimension @xmath0 by the multifractal function @xmath31 .",
    "the conditions of application of the steepest descent method @xmath32 allow us to find special fractal dimension @xmath33 related to given parameter @xmath23",
    ".    above consideration shows that the passage from monofractal phase space to multifractal one is obtained by replacement of the single dimension @xmath0 by the function @xmath34 that monotonically increases , taking value @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "limit behaviour of the function @xmath34 is characterized by the asymptotics @xmath39 physical domain of the @xmath23 parameter variation is bounded by condition @xmath40 which ensures positive values of the function @xmath41 .    as a result , we can use well - known tsallis formalism of the non - extensive statistics where role of the non - additivity parameter plays inverted value @xmath3 of the multifractal function @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the entropy in dependence of the probability distribution @xmath42 has the form @xcite @xmath43 with accounting the conditions @xmath44 this expression arrives at the generalized distribution over energy levels @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the partition function and the deformed exponential is determined in the usual manner : @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{{\\bar\\tau}-1}}\\ { \\rm at}\\ 1+({\\bar\\tau}-1)x>0,\\\\ 0\\ \\",

    "\\label{15}\\ ] ]    in spite of the formal similarity of above expressions with the same of the tsallis statistics , a principle difference takes place : in the last case , the limit of extensive systems is reached , when non - additivity parameter takes value @xmath38 , whereas the multifractal phase space is reduced to monofractal one with dimension @xmath50 in the opposite limit @xmath51 . in this way",
    ", the step - function spectrum @xmath34 , being @xmath52 at @xmath40 and @xmath37 otherwise , relates to the smooth phase space .",
    "thermodynamic functions of the model under consideration can be found analogously to the tsallis non - extensive scheme @xcite .",
    "however , related expressions are very cumbersome even in the simplest case of the ideal gas @xcite and amount to the usual form only within the slightly non - extensive limit @xcite . at the same time , developed scheme allows one to use thermodynamic formalism of multifractal objects @xcite . within the latter ,",
    "the role of a state parameter plays the multifractal index @xmath23 , whose variation may arrive at phase transitions if the dependence @xmath34 has some singularities .",

    "this exhibits the known ` @xmath63'-duality of tsallis thermostatistics @xcite .    according to @xcite",
    "the physical distribution is neither escort nor input probabilities , but the following one @xmath64 it corresponds to the condition @xmath65 instead of the second equation ( [ 13 ] ) .",
