    "one of the important open problems in the physics of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite@xcite is the complete understanding of the hierarchical hall plateaus , whose filling fractions fall beyond the laughlin sequence @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of theoretical descriptions available at present : the wave - function constructions and the effective conformal field theories ( cft ) in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the first approach has culminated in the jain theory of the composite - fermion correspondence between the integer hall states with @xmath3 and the hierarchical states with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , such as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the existence of the composite - fermion excitations has been confirmed by many experiments @xcite ; the corresponding ansatz wave - functions have been tested in numerical simulations of few electron systems @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these have been mostly done on the spatial geometry of the sphere and have firmly established that the jain states describe the bulk excitations of quantum hall fluids . on the other hand ,",
    "these incompressible fluids have characteristic edge excitations @xcite , which can not be seen on the sphere geometry .",
    "these excitations are the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom in the conduction experiments , and their basic properties , like the fractional charge , have been already measured in the simplest ( yet non - trivial ) case of the @xmath7 laughlin hall state @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the edge excitations are naturally described by the conformal field theories dimensions @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite , because their low - energy dynamics is effectively one - dimensional , being localized on the boundary of the sample within a width of the order of the magnetic length @xmath8 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the conformal field theories are a powerful tool because they can be solved explicitly in a non - perturbative framework @xcite , and predict universal data like the filling fraction , the fractional charge and quantum statistics of the edge excitations ; moreover , they directly describe the relevant experimental regime of a large number of electrons .",
    "however , these effective descriptions can not be easily related to the microscopic dynamics of the electrons .",
    "actually , based on simple arguments and symmetry principles , two classes of cfts have been proposed for the edge excitations of the hierarchical plateaus .",
    "the first is given by the @xmath9-component abelian theories @xmath10 , which are generalizations of the successful one - component theory for the laughlin plateaus @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the literature ,",
    "these conformal theories have been naturally associated with the jain approach , because the composite - fermion correspondence implies the existence of several effective landau levels , which may have independent edges of the laughlin type .",
    "the second class of conformal field theories encompasses the @xmath0 minimal models @xcite , which exploit the @xmath0 symmetry of the incompressible fluids under area - preserving diffeomorphisms of the plane @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the hierarchical hall plateaus and the @xmath0 minimal theories .",
    "these theories can be obtained by projecting out some states of the multi - component abelian theory , those which are not fluctuations of an elementary incompressible fluid .",
    "this projection implies different properties for the edge excitations in the two theories , which are qualitatively and quantitatively important @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study numerically the spectrum of a finite systems of @xmath11 and @xmath12 electrons on a disk geometry ; we diagonalize exactly the hamiltonian with the haldane short - range interaction in the first landau level @xcite .",
    "the low - lying states occur in branches which are separated by gaps ; each branch contains one state of lowest angular momentum , the `` bottom '' state , followed by several higher angular momentum levels with close energies ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "this pattern is well understood for the @xmath7 laughlin hall fluid : the bottom state is the ground state , which is an exact eigenstate of the haldane interaction ; the higher levels are the degenerate edge excitations .",
    "the plot of density profiles shows that the ground state is rather flat , a characteristic of incompressible fluids @xcite , and that the edge excitations are infinitesimal density deformations .",
    "we use the density plots to gain a qualitative understanding of the spectrum : we find that the other bottom states can be either quasi - particle excitations ( oscillating density profile ) , or new incompressible fluids with lower filling fractions , such as @xmath13 ( flat density profile ) .",
    "furthermore , we overlap the low - lying states with the jain ansatz states .",
    "the jain composite - fermion theory on the disk geometry does predict the branches in the spectrum : they correspond to effective landau levels which are filled selectively at the boundary .",
    "these states are usually denoted by @xmath14 $ ] , and correspond to filling the @xmath15-th level with @xmath16 electrons , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that each branch in the spectrum is well described by one of these states , corresponding to a given set of fillings @xmath19 , and by the corresponding particle - hole excitations .",
    "we then find the following results .",
    "smooth density profiles identify unambiguously the branches corresponding to the @xmath13 and @xmath20 hierarchical plateaus , for each value of @xmath21 ; the rest are quasi - particles branches over the @xmath7 laughlin and the hierarchical plateaus ; previous numerical analyses",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite only charted the energy spectrum and were naturally led to misinterpret the branches .",
    "next , we observe that , within each branch , the low - lying states can be divided into families of close density profiles : the edge excitations correspond to infinitesimal deformations of the bottom state , while families with different density profiles are other bulk excitations or magneto - phonons , which are not well separated in energy for these small values of @xmath21 .",
    "this decomposition in families is first understood in the case of a quasi - particle over the laughlin state ( @xmath22 ) : we find a precise correspondence between the exact spectrum and the conformal field theory by using the jain composite - fermion theory , as it follows .",
    "we begin by computing the overlap matrix between the exact low - lying states and the jain states of the branch ( for example , suppose that the quasi - particle corresponds to the filling @xmath23 $ ] for eight electrons ) .",
    "these jain states are particle - hole excitations of two effective landau levels , and can be mapped one - to - one to the states of the two - component abelian conformal theory . as a consequence , each low - lying exact state in the branch",
    "has a label of this conformal theory ( up to @xmath24 finite - size errors ) .",
    "we then find that the edge excitations of the laughlin quasi - particle match certain conformal states which are symmetric with respect to the two abelian components , i.e. the two effective landau levels .",
    "more precisely , these states are obtained by the projection @xmath25 relating the two - component and the one - component abelian theories .",
    "therefore , the laughlin quasi - particles are indeed described by the one - component abelian theory , like the well - understood quasi - holes  this is expected in a relativistic theory . moreover ,",
    "the quasi - particle edge excitations amount to a specific sub - set of the larger jain spectrum .",
    "having understood the pattern of the edge excitations of the laughlin quasi - particles , we proceed to analyse other branches in the spectrum , whose edge excitations are less understood . for eight electrons , we find that the edge spectrum of the @xmath13 hierarchical hall state and its first quasi - particle match the predictions of the @xmath0 minimal conformal theory .",
    "this theory realizes the weaker projection @xmath26 @xcite , which again eliminates the antisymmetric excitations between the two abelian components , but keeps all the symmetric ones @xcite ; there remains a non - trivial sector of neutral excitations , as explained in section iic .",
    "therefore , the numerical study support the description of the hierarchical plateaus by the @xmath0 minimal conformal theory .",
    "the electrons form an irreducible , minimal incompressible fluid , which is in many respects analogous to the original laughlin fluid @xcite .    the same pattern of families of edge excitations in the low - lying spectrum is also found for @xmath27 and @xmath12 electrons . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the finite - size span for the angular momentum of edge excitations , @xmath28 , is too small to see any difference between the one - component abelian ( laughlin states ) and the @xmath0 minimal theories ( hierarchical states ) ; namely , the results are consistent with our picture but are not very significative . for @xmath29",
    ", we find that the @xmath13 hall plateau clearly displays the edge spectrum predicted by the @xmath0 minimal theory , as in the @xmath30 case ; on the other hand , the @xmath31 hierarchical state and its quasi - particles are less neat .",
    "anyhow , these data can not be consistently interpreted by the alternative multi - component abelian theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath32",
    ", we recall the main results of the jain theory and the predictions of the two classes of cfts , which are then used to analyse the data in section @xmath33 ( @xmath30 ) and section @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "finally , we end up with some conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath36 electrons in the first landau level on a disk geometry ; we use open boundary conditions , namely , we truncate the hilbert space of single - particle angular momentum states at a value that is very large compared to the highest occupied level in the laughlin state . the interaction among the electrons",
    "is given by the haldane short - range potential , which selects the @xmath7 laughlin incompressible ground state .",
    "of course , we are interested in studying the @xmath13 incompressible ground state , and other hierarchical states , for which there is no analogous model interaction .",
    "an overview of the @xmath30 spectrum is shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) as a function of the angular momentum @xmath37 : one clearly sees the branches of low - lying states .",
    "no confining potential is present , but this can be easily added afterwards : a quadratic potential increases the energy of each state by an amount proportional to @xmath37 ; thus , the bottom state of each branch can be made the ground state by suitably tuning the strength of the potential .",
    "if this ground state has an approximately constant density , its filling fraction is @xmath38 , up to finite - size corrections of relative order @xmath24 .",
    "let us finally quote the previous analysis on the disk geometry , which were useful in setting up our work @xcite@xcite@xcite .      according to the composite - fermion theory , there is a correspondence between @xmath9 filled effective landau levels ( @xmath39 ) and the hierarchical hall states @xcite : ^*=m  = m pm 1  , m=1,2 , ",

    "the composite - fermion correspondence also describes the excited states by inserting in ( [ jwf ] ) the slater determinants for the @xmath39 electron transitions .    on the disk geometry",
    ", the landau levels can be filled selectively by making electron droplets with different edge shapes : these `` bottom '' states are denoted by @xmath42 $ ] and correspond to the slater determinants of @xmath16 electrons filling the lowest angular momentum states of the @xmath15-th landau level @xcite .",
    "each bottom state has an independent branch of low - lying states corresponding to the particle - hole excitations of the effective levels .",
    "the jain correspondence ( [ jwf ] ) applied to these bottom states yields @xmath43 states which are characterized by the following angular momenta and approximate energies @xcite : j_[n_1,  ,n_k ] & = & n(n-1 ) + n_1(n_1 - 1 ) 2 + n_2(n_2- 3 ) 2 + n_3(n_3 - 5 ) 2 +  , + e^(0)_[n_1,  ,n_k ] & = & e_d ( n_2 + 2 n_3 + 3 n_4 + )  .",

    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "the jain ansatz was also modified to be completely written in the first landau level ; nevertheless , in this paper we shall use the original proposal ( [ jwf ] ) and perform the projection @xmath41 numerically .",
    "the jain bottom states ( [ jed ] ) for eight electrons are summarized in table ( [ tab1 ] ) : the @xmath45 $ ] state is identified as the laughlin @xmath7 incompressible state",
    ". the rest of states could be candidates for the @xmath13 ground state , because they have @xmath46 up to @xmath47 finite - size corrections ; actually , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath48 , any state @xmath49 $ ] , with @xmath50 fixed , would work .",
    "the jain bottom states match rather well the numerical spectrum in fig.([fig1 ] ) : for almost all predicted @xmath37 values in table ( [ tab1 ] ) , there is a bottom state of a branch of low - lying states ; its energy is rather well approximated by the jain formula ( [ jed ] ) .",

    "it is rather well established that the low - energy excitations of a droplet of quantum incompressible fluid reside on the boundary and can be described by a @xmath2-dimensional conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "this can be simply understood in the case of one filled landau level ( see fig.([fig2 ] ) ) , which can be considered as the fermi sea ( in configuration space ) of a one - dimensional system with one chirality only @xcite .",
    "its low - lying excitations are particle - hole transitions near the fermi surface , which is actually the physical edge of the ( circular ) electron droplet . by a well - known procedure",
    ", one can take the thermodynamic limit @xmath48 and approximate the fermi sea by a dirac vacuum ; moreover , the energy of the low - lying excitations can be linearized around the fermi level , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the momentum , @xmath57 the fermi velocity and @xmath58 the size of the disk .",
    "these are the edge excitations of the @xmath59 quantum hall state ; in a finite system , their wave number is limited by @xmath60 , i.e. their angular momentum must be @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "the relativistic one - dimensional effective fermion is identified as the charged , chiral weyl fermion ; the conformal symmetry of this theory is described by the virasoro algebra with central charge @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this effective conformal field theory of the @xmath59 plateau can be generalized to the laughlin states by the well - known bosonization procedure : one rewrites the weyl fermion in terms of a bosonic field , changes its compactification radius and obtains a general @xmath63 abelian conformal theory , whose one - dimensional current satisfies the abelian current algebra @xmath64 @xcite ; an equivalent name is the chiral luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "this description of the edge excitations of the laughlin states is well established both theoretically and experimentally @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "an important property for the following discussion is that the hilbert spaces of the edge excitations of the integer and laughlin hall states , @xmath1 , are all isomorphic @xcite ; thus , these excitations can be still visualized as the particle - hole transitions in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is rather simple to count them for small values of @xmath65 , and obtain the multiplicities reported in the first line of table ( [ tab2 ] ) @xcite ; let us stress that the cft description of edge excitations is valid in the linear range @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of the above picture is to consider the case of two filled landau levels : the corresponding edge excitations are described by the two - component abelian cft , which is simply the tensor product of two one - component theories .",

    "note , however , that the quasi - particles in these abelian theories carry the iso - spin quantum number in such a way that it is linearly additive as another electric charge ; namely , there are no non - abelian effects @xcite .",
    "these @xmath79 generators can be defined for all the hierarchical ground states @xmath83 , but are not realized in terms of fermions ; we can nevertheless continue to use the more intuitive fermionic language , owing to the aforementioned isomorphism between hilbert spaces .",
    "after these preliminaries , we are ready to define the @xmath0 minimal theory ( for @xmath84 ) : this is obtained from the two - component abelian theory by imposing the constraint @xcite , j^-_0 = 0  .",
    "[ hamred ] it can be shown that the zero modes @xmath85 commute with the virasoro generators ; thus , the constraint ( [ hamred ] ) does not spoil the conformal invariance and defines a new conformal theory with the same central charge .",
    "the effect of the constraint is the following : the operator @xmath86 moves electrons down and holes up between the two layers ( with a minus sign in the latter case ) , while keeping their ( normal - ordered ) angular momentum constant ; it relates the edge excitations in the two layers and actually vanishes on their symmetric linear combinations . therefore , the condition ( [ hamred ] ) projects out the edge excitations which are antisymmetric with respect to the two levels .",
    "the ground state is unique and symmetric , then it satisfies the constraint : namely , the two cfts share the same ground state .",
    "let us see some examples of allowed edge excitations in the minimal theory .",
    "we first need to clarify the angular - momentum labels in cft .",

    "we conclude that the new criterion of density plots is essential for distinguishing laughlin quasi - particles from new hierarchical plateaus .",
    "we can actually observe the formation of a hierarchical hall fluid @xcite : as soon as sizable number @xmath132 of laughlin quasi - particles are present , they condense into a new incompressible fluid , whose density shape is again smooth ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "after having established that @xmath126 is a laughlin quasi - particle , we should understand the origin of the extra family @xmath128 of low - lying states .",
    "this is explained by the jain theory , which we now analyse in detail ; we are going to illustrate the following chain of relations :    ccc low - lying  exact  states &   jain  states   & two - component  abelian  cft + & & + edge  excitations & & one - component  abelian  cft    [ rela ] the jain wave functions corresponding to the @xmath23 $ ] branch are obtained by plugging in ( [ jwf ] ) the slater determinants for the particle - hole excitations of the first and second levels filled with @xmath133 and @xmath32 electrons , respectively .",
    "these states are , by construction , in one - to - one correspondence with those of the two - component abelian conformal theory ; thus , we use the same notation for them , in particular the basis of section iic , equations ( [ delta1 ] ) and ( [ deltwo ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the jain states are not orthogonal ; therefore , we diagonalize them by the gram - schmidt method ( by also computing the overlaps among themselves ) .    for each angular momentum value @xmath134 , we have computed the matrix of overlaps between these jain states and the low - lying spectrum ( see table ( [ tab20 ] ) ) . the total square overlap with each state is very large ( about 0.96 ) , and the matrix determinant is large enough to match these states one - to - one .",
    "we conclude that the jain theory describes very well all the low - lying states .",
    "nonetheless , this does not imply that they all should be edge excitations , as shown by the previous arguments of the density plot and of the consistency with the laughlin theory .",
    "let us recall that , in principle , the jain theory and the conformal field theory give rather different descriptions of the spectrum : the former applies directly to all excitations for finite @xmath21 , while the latter only accounts for the edge excitations in the large @xmath21 limit , which requires some imagination .",
    "the analysis of the overlap matrices in table ( [ tab20 ] ) let us identify which jain states correspond to the edge excitations of the laughlin quasi - particle in fig.([fig5 ] ) . the edge state @xmath135 clearly matches the symmetric state @xmath136 in equation ( [ delta1 ] ) .",
    "the five states at @xmath137 can be divided in two groups : ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) have larger overlaps with the symmetric states in ( [ deltwo ] ) , and ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) with the antisymmetric states .",
    "the precision is lower than for @xmath143 , but it is nonetheless remarkable that the signal is not completely washed out by the finite - size effects .    this pattern of overlaps can be understood as a relation among conformal field theories by applying the analysis of section iic : the edge excitations of the laughlin quasi - particle , @xmath135 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , have large overlaps with the symmetric states of the two - component abelian theory which are generated by the @xmath108 current ( [ udiag ] ) , namely @xmath136 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the laughlin quasi - particle is indeed described by the one - component abelian conformal theory ; the new result is that this is obtained in the jain spectrum by the projection @xmath25 described in the section iic .",
    "similar families of symmetric laughlin edge excitations with multiplicities ( 1,1,2 ) are actually found in any branch and for any number of electrons : this is perhaps the most important result of this paper .",
    "these `` standard '' families are enlarged by further edge excitations in the case of hierarchical hall states , as discussed hereafter .",
    "* branches [ 5,3 ] , [ 5,2,1 ] : the @xmath13 hierarchical hall state and its quasi - particle *    fig.([fig5 ] ) shows the family of low - lying states starting at @xmath88 , which is identified with the @xmath87 $ ] branch .",
    "the bottom state @xmath146 has a rather flat profile and can be considered as a new incompressible ground state ; the value of @xmath147 is close to its thermodynamic limit of @xmath148 ( at variance with the quasi - particle state @xmath149 ) .",
    "moreover , a family of edge excitations is clearly associated to @xmath146 , which have multiplicities @xmath150 , in agreement with the predictions of the @xmath0 minimal cft ( third row of table ( [ tab2 ] ) ) .",

    "let us add one remark .",
    "the third state @xmath161 at @xmath137 which makes the difference between the ubiquitous laughlin edge spectrum and the hierarchical one , has an alternative description in the jain theory as the bottom state of the @xmath162 $ ] branch .",
    "here we first encounter the phenomenon of superposition of jain branches , which is a sort of degeneracy in the description of the spectrum ; it is an interesting dynamical problem in the jain theory , which has not been addressed so far .",
    "it can be rephrased as an `` interaction among defects '' in the regime of compact electron droplets @xcite ; it might also be associated to the mechanism of the `` condensation of quasi - particles '' of the original hierarchical scheme @xcite ( or maybe not ) . as a matter of fact , this dynamical phenomena does not concern the cft interpretation , which is an effective description of the edge excitations above a given ground state",
    "; there is just a practical consequence that the one - to - one identification of states in ( [ rela ] ) might be lost in case of mixing of two competing jain branches .",
    "the overlaps of the @xmath162 $ ] jain branch with the @xmath163 low - lying states are not very good , although the bottom state itself has a good overlap .",
    "this branch is rather atypical , and can not be considered as a candidate incompressible state because it is almost gapless with the @xmath87 $ ] branch .",
    "we now proceed to analyse the branch @xmath164 , which is plotted in fig.([fig6 ] ) .",
    "its natural interpretation is of a quasi - particle over the @xmath13 ground state , due to the oscillating density profile .",
    "the @xmath0 minimal theory predicts the same pattern of edge excitations as for the @xmath13 ground state , i.e. ( 1,1,3 ) @xcite ; this is actually observed in fig.([fig6 ] ) , and add further support to whole picture put forward in this paper .",
    "a slight peculiarity is that the third state at @xmath137 is higher in energy than other non - edge states  but the shape is more important in our analysis .",
    "next , we proceed to the identification of these states by the overlap analysis ( see table ( [ tab40 ] ) ) .",
    "the jain theory presents a degenerate description for this branch , namely @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] ( see table ( [ tab1 ] ) ) .",
    "the overlaps show that the latter wins , i.e. the states of the @xmath51 $ ] branch have less than @xmath24 projection on the low - lying states ; apparently , the electron tends to `` pile up '' in the effective landau levels .",
    "the empirical rule taken from this and other cases of two competing jain branches is that one of them describes well the data , while the other definitely does not .",
    "the jain states of the @xmath52 $ ] branch should be related to a three - component abelian conformal theory ; this is the first step in extending the chain of relations ( [ rela ] ) to this branch . for @xmath143 , there are three abelian edge states , which can be written , in analogy with eq.([hamred ] ) : 1 ; a & = & 1 ( u^_1 u_0 + c^_1 c_0 + d^_1 d_0 )  ,   + 1 ; b & = & 1 ( u^_1 u_0 - c^_1 c_0 )  , + 1 ; c & = & 1 ( u^_1 u_0 + c^_1 c_0 - 2 d^_1 d_0 )  .",
    "[ three]the ground state is @xmath165\\rangle$ ] and the @xmath166 are fermionic fock operators for the upper , central and lower ( effective ) landau levels .    in this case",
    ", we expect that the edge excitations are described by a reduction from the three - component abelian theory to the @xmath84 @xmath0 minimal theory ( analogous to the @xmath110 projection ( [ rela ] ) for the laughlin quasi - particles ) .",

    "this is in agreement with the overlaps reported in table ( [ tab30 ] ) .",
    "next , the overlap analysis can not be carried over to the @xmath137 edge excitations , owing to the finite - size limitations : the jain state @xmath52 $ ] possesses only one electron in the highest effective landau level , and is very far from the thermodynamic limit of three fermi surfaces which is implicit in the cft description ; in particular , one of the @xmath137 particle - hole excitations in the higher level is missing .",
    "therefore , we can not analyse the projection of states in this branch ; nevertheless , the shape and number of edge excitations are in agreement with the predictions of the @xmath0 minimal theory for a quasi - particle over the @xmath13 state .",

    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of the exact numerical spectrum of up to ten interacting electrons in the first landau level on the disk geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we study the edge excitations of the hierarchical plateaus and check the predictions of two relevant conformal field theories : the multi - component abelian theory and the @xmath0 minimal theory of the incompressible fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two new criteria for identifying the edge excitations within the low - lying states : the plot of their density profiles and the study of their overlaps with the jain wave functions in a meaningful basis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the exact bulk and edge excitations are very well reproduced by the jain states ; these , in turn , can be described by the multi - component abelian conformal theory . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , we observe that the edge excitations form sub - families of the low - lying states with a definite pattern , which is explained by the @xmath0 minimal conformal theory . actually , the two conformal theories are related by a projection mechanism whose effects are observed in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the edge excitations of the hierarchical hall states are consistently described by the @xmath0 minimal theory , within the finite - size limitations .    </S>",
