    "holographic duality is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing area of theoretical physics in recent years .",
    "the idea of holographic duality was originated when bekenstein argued that a black hole should possess entropy proportional to its horizon area instead of volume of the black hole  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the entropy associated with the horizon is measured in the unit of the planck area , @xmath1 , signalling the quantum gravity effect even for a macroscopically large black hole .",
    "it was proposed by t hooft  @xcite that the quantum gravity effect is revealed by the reduction of dimension occurring at the horizon . within a region of space ,",
    "a finite amount of energy can be filled before it undergo a gravitational collapse . since the entropy of a black hole is determined by the horizon area",
    ", the gravitational collapse gives the upper bound on the amount of entropy or information we can store in a region of space .",
    "it is given by the entropy of the black hole filling up the entire region , proportional to the horizon area in the unit of planck area . in this sense ,",
    "all of the information in a region of space can be encoded in the boundary of the region , a holographic relation  @xcite .",
    "view from the observer hovering in the spacetime outside a black hole , the horizon is an effective boundary of the space .",
    "namely , any object falling to the black hole will appear ever more frozen and smeared as it approaches the horizon and nothing will pass through . the holographic relation between the bulk space and its boundary",
    "can be naturally generalized to the other cases where there is no black hole in a bounded space .",
    "one notable situation is the ads space .",
    "the gravity of the background ads space pulls everything back to the center .",
    "the massless particles can reach the infinity but they will go back to the original point in finite time .",
    "the ads space thus acts like a confining box and the infinity can be thought of as the boundary of the space . in context of the string theory ,",
    "the evidences of the duality between gravitational physics in the bulk and the gauge theory on the boundary of the ads space were found by many authors  @xcite which ultimately lead to the ads / cft correspondence conjecture by maldacena  @xcite .",
    "an extension to finite temperature duality can be achieved by performing the path integral of the partition function in the euclideanized time  @xcite .",
    "if the ads / cft correspondence is correct , the partition function of the gravity theory in the ads will be the same as the partition function of the gauge theory on the boundary . by identifying the regulated gravity action with the free energy  ( modulo a @xmath2 factor ) of the thermal gravity system  @xcite",
    ", we can study thermodynamics of the dual gauge theory on the boundary .",
    "it is known that ads space has 3 thermal phases ; pure radiation , small black hole  ( sbh ) , and large black hole  ( lbh ) . on the boundary ,",
    "the bulk thermal phases of radiation and black holes correspond to the confined and deconfined phases of the strongly interacting gauge matter .",
    "holographically , radiation in the thermal ads corresponds to the gas of confined hadrons whilst the radiation in the ads - bh background corresponds to the gas or soup  ( due to the strong coupling ) of deconfined quarks and gluons which henceforth we will simply refer to as the qgp .",
    "the hawking - page transition of the pure radiation to the black hole in the bulk ads space is dual to the deconfinement phase transition of the confined gauge matter to the quark - gluon plasma  ( qgp ) on the boundary .",
    "the transition from the pure radiation to bhs can occur both classically by gravitational collapse and quantum mechanically by tunneling .",
    "conventional viewpoint when the back - reaction of the hawking radiation is neglected is the following .",
    "when the temperature is sufficiently large , i.e. above the critical temperature  ( @xmath3 given by eqn .",
    "( [ tcrit ] ) in this article ) , the pure radiation inevitably collapses to form a bh . if the temperature is lower than @xmath3 but larger than a minimum temperature @xmath4  ( given by eqn .",
    "( [ tmin ] ) in our text ) , a tunneling from pure radiation to bh could occur with a probability .",
    "classical transition by gravitational collapse is a general phenomena not limited to the pure radiation .",
    "we can consider ads star with arbitrary particle content , fermions and bosons , and study its collapse .",
    "holographic duality should apply to any of these ads stars .",
    "a pioneering work on the holographic degenerate star with fermion content has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors successfully construct multitrace composite operators in the cft side as the dual of the bulk fermionic star .",
    "ads / cft dictionary leads to the exact matching of the conformal dimension of the composite operator and the adm mass of the ads star when self - gravity is neglected .",
    "holographically , gravitational collapse of an ads star is dual to the thermalization process of the gauge matter on the boundary  @xcite .",
    "the mass limit of the ads star corresponds to the minimal amount of energy density required for the dual gauge matter to initiate the thermalization process .",
    "additionally , the temperature of the resulting qgp is also determined by the mass limit of the pre - collapsed star .",
    "investigation on the conditions of the ads star before the gravitational collapse could arguably reveal the necessary conditions for the formation of the deconfined qgp in the dual picture .    in this article",
    ", we extend the investigation of the fermionic ads star to the bulk conformal limit where the bulk fermion mass is vanishing . by numerically solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff  ( tov ) equation , we study the effects of various parameters to the mass limit of the degenerate ads star . notably by varying the fermion mass , the corresponding mass limit ranges from lbh to sbh . in the bulk conformal",
    "limit , the mass limit saturates to a maximum value specific to each dimension .",
    "we demonstrate that the maximal mass limit is exactly the same as the mass limit of the pure radiation as a result of the bulk conformal symmetry .",
    "in contrast to the radiation star , the degenerate star of massless fermion has zero bulk temperature and entropy .",
    "we interpret the maximal mass limit as the _ universal _ conformal dimension of the composite operators in the cft side above which deconfinement phase transition is inevitable . a remarkable linear relationship between the mass limit and total particle number",
    "is also found in the bulk conformal limit .",
    "bulk and boundary explanations are given .",
    "the article is organized as the following . in section [ ii ] , we briefly review the tov equation and the equations of state of the degenerate star in the ads space . for completeness",
    ", we also review the construction of the composite multitrace operators dual to the degenerate star .",
    "rigorous calculations of the mass of the ads star neglecting self - gravity are demonstrated to be exactly the same as given via the ads / cft dictionary . in section [ adsself ] , we present the main results of this article .",
    "numerical results are interpreted in terms of the cft on the gauge theory side .",
    "section [ iv ] reviews the thermodynamics of the ads space in generic @xmath5 dimensions , eqn .",
    "( [ ibh ] ) is a new result suitable for calculating tunneling rate of the quantum mechanical phase transition .",
    "the bulk conformal limit is discussed in section [ v ] .",
    "we also argue the possibility of stable sbh phase when the back reaction of the hawking radiation is included .",
    "section [ vi ] concludes our article .",
    "in this section , we consider degenerate star in the ads space .",
    "since we are interested in the construction of the gravity dual of the charge - neutral gauge matter living on the boundary , we will assume that the star content is purely fermionic with no charges .",
    "the fermion has no other interactions except gravity , both from the background ads and the self - gravity .",
    "the ads star has been studied extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite for zero temperature and in ref .",
    "@xcite for finite temperature with external magnetic field . in this section",
    ", we will review the basic of the ads star at zero temperature and discuss the situation when self - gravity is negligible . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we extend the investigation to include self - gravity and explore the limit when the fermion has zero mass .",
    "we also review the construction of the composite operator in the dual cft side as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite and demonstrate in details the exact agreement between the conformal dimension of the composite operator and mass of the ads star when self - gravity is neglected .",
    "the review content will be extended to describe the duality in the zero - fermion - mass limit in subsequent sections , especially in the double scaling limit of the cft side .",
    "the equations of motion of our system are derived from the einstein s field equation in @xmath5-dimensional ads space .",
    "starting from a generic spherically symmetric line element in @xmath5-dimension @xmath6 we assume the energy - momentum tensor of the fermion is given by the perfect fluid form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the 4-velocity , energy density , and pressure respectively . solving the einstein s field equation  ( see e.g. ref .",

    "the density and pressure of the fermion gas at zero temperature are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of internal degrees of freedom such as spin , flavour and colour of the fermion .",
    "note that for @xmath25  ( conformal limit ) , the density and pressure become @xmath26 a linear equation of state . in @xmath25 limit",
    ", the ads star behaves like a radiation star  ( at zero temperature , this is possible for a fermionic star or a bose - condensate star ) .",
    "the radiation star in the ads space turns out to have a finite mass limit but infinite radius as we will see later .",
    "because of the infinite radius , the radiation star can be thought of as a thermal phase of the ads space , i.e. the ads space filling with radiation .",
    "the temperature profile of the radiation star is given by @xmath27 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath28 when we consider the ads star and only turn on the temperature when we compare the ads - bh with the thermal ads in subsequent section .",
    "according to the usual ads / cft dictionary , the conformal dimension of the fermionic single trace operator @xmath29 is related to the mass of the bulk fermion @xmath30 by @xmath31 for large @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the conformal dimension of an operator can be thought of as a scaled mass in the bulk .    by using the dictionary above",
    ", arsiwalla et al @xcite found a perfect matching between the bulk mass of a spherical symmetric ads star and the conformal dimension of the multi - trace operator in the boundary description when the self - gravity of the bulk is neglected .",
    "let us briefly review how they construct the composite operators and count the conformal dimensions of such operators .",
    "exclusion principle demands that the composite operators , @xmath34 , should contain derivatives of the single - trace fermionic operators , @xmath35  ( since the cft exists in @xmath36-dimensions , the number of possible derivatives is @xmath37 ) .",
    "the most generic and simplest form is given by @xmath38 where the product over all possible permutation of the derivatives is included for a given number of derivatives .",
    "each product contains different numbers of derivatives of the single - trace operator and we call them a  shell \" .",
    "the last shell contains permutation of @xmath39 derivatives at the most and @xmath40 is the maximal number of derivatives in the last shell .",
    "the composite operator thus depends only on @xmath40 and the number of possible configuration for a fixed @xmath40 is one .",
    "the entropy of each @xmath40-operator is zero so we call it a _ degenerate _ multi - trace operator .",
    "a degenerate multi - trace operator is a good candidate for the corresponding dual of the degenerate fermion gas  ( at zero temperature ) in the bulk .",
    "the number of fields @xmath35 in the shell with @xmath39 derivatives is given by @xmath41 which is equal to the number of particles in the bulk .",
    "for a fixed @xmath40 , the total number of fields corresponding to the total number of bulk particles is therefore @xmath42 in order to estimate the bulk mass , we need to calculate the conformal dimension of the composite operator @xmath34 for a certain @xmath40 . since each derivative increases conformal dimension by one , the conformal dimension of @xmath34 is @xmath43    by using the approximate correspondence  ( valid only when @xmath32 ) @xmath44 we find an approximate relation between the bulk mass , the fermi energy and the bulk fermion mass to the leading order of @xmath14 as the following @xmath45 where @xmath46 are used .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath30 corresponds to the rest energy and the term proportional to @xmath37 , originated from derivatives , corresponds to the kinetic energy of the fermion in the bulk .",
    "on the other hand , the gravitational mass of the ads star in the bulk can be calculated via eqn .",
    "( [ eom of m ] ) .",
    "integrating by parts and using thermodynamic relation @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 the number density in @xmath5-dimension is given by @xmath49 using ( [ mu and a ] ) and solving @xmath50 when ignoring self - gravity , i.e. @xmath51 , we get @xmath52 after performing the integration , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a gamma function . by using properties of gamma function @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ", the ads mass can be calculated to be exactly the same expression as the right - hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ cft mass ] ) , i.e. @xmath57 this is an amazing result showing the correspondence between the conformal dimension of multitrace operator in the cft and the mass of the ads fermionic star in the bulk .",
    "we should remark that the calculation of the bulk mass depends crucially on the functional form of the chemical potential with respect to the radial coordinate , @xmath58 for the ads space .",
    "this is the main reason why there is an exact matching between the bulk mass and the mass calculated from conformal dimension via the dictionary of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we can rescale the total bulk mass of the ads star in terms of the bulk fermion mass @xmath30 as the following @xmath59 where the central chemical potential , @xmath60 , is identified with the fermi energy @xmath21 .",
    "the mass is an increasing function of @xmath60 and contains no information of the mass limit of the degenerate star .",
    "it neglects the effect of self - gravity and is not suitable for the gravitational collapse situation where self - gravity dominates and competes with the degenerate pressure .",
    "we will consider the situation when self - gravity is included in the next section .",
    "if we consider @xmath61 and @xmath62 cases , we obtain the mass in the @xmath63 and @xmath64    @xmath65    respectively .    the total particle number @xmath66 can also be integrated with respect to the curved spatial volume by using the number density given by eqn .  ( [ nden ] ) , @xmath67 substitute @xmath68  ( since when self - gravity is neglected @xmath69 ) and change the integration variable to @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 where we have used the identities of gamma function , eqn .",
    "( [ gamid ] ) , in the last step as before .",
    "again this is in exact agreement with the total particle number given by eqn .",
    "( [ nf ] ) , ( [ app ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) in the boundary theory .",
    "remarkably , we can define the density of states @xmath72 for the  boundary free field \" @xmath35  @xcite for which @xmath73 it is interesting to compare the integrand of eqn .",
    "( [ mbu ] ) , ( [ nbu ] ) , and ( [ nmbo ] ) since they are integrated within the same range of energy variable .",
    "it is quite intriguing that different functions of integrand give exactly the same result , bulk and boundary .",
    "the boundary description has a statistical interpretation in terms of the density of states @xmath74 while we can not define a density - of - states function in the bulk , i.e. the integrand in eqn .",
    "( [ nbu ] ) does not lead to the correct integrand of mass in eq .",
    "( [ mbu ] ) when multiplied by @xmath70 .",
    "nevertheless , an obvious relationship is established between the _ bulk _ mass and particle number as we can derive from differentiating eqn .",
    "( [ nmbo ] ) with respect to @xmath21 on the _ boundary _ @xmath75 the same relationship can also be obtained by using the einstein equations as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , since the chemical potential is determined as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath76 as @xmath77 the accumulated mass @xmath18 can be directly integrated out to be a function of @xmath76 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "for example , when @xmath80 the integrand becomes a polynomial and the accumulated mass is given by @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "similarly for the particle number accumulated from @xmath83 to @xmath76 , @xmath84 for @xmath80 , the polynomial integral is simplified to @xmath85 with @xmath86 given above .",
    "it is apparent from eqn .",
    "( [ mat0 ] ) and ( [ ntot ] ) that both the total mass and particle number of the ads star are increasing functions of @xmath21 when the self - gravity is neglected  ( and @xmath87 ) .",
    "consequently , there is no mass limit in this case .",
    "the mass and particle number continue to increase without bound as the central chemical potential grows .",
    "naturally , neglecting self - gravity leaves us with only the gravity generated from the ads background metric .",
    "the ads star can attain any large masses which are determined from the equilibrium between the background gravity and the degenerate pressure .",
    "since the background gravity is always bounded  ( i.e. no coordinate singularities ) , there is no possibility of gravitational collapse signalling the appearance of the event horizon , therefore the absence of the mass limit .",
    "in section [ cor0 ] , it is demonstrated that the correspondence between conformal dimension of the boundary operator and the mass of semiclassical bulk field lead to an exact matching between the conformal dimension of the multitrace fermionic operator and the bulk mass of the fermionic degenerate star , eqn .",
    "( [ mat0 ] ) , in the absence of self - gravity . in obtaining the correspondence ,",
    "we have made certain approximation @xmath32 , @xmath33 that the mass is large .",
    "it is also taken that @xmath40 is large comparing to @xmath5 .    in the presence of strong self - gravity",
    ", there is a possibility of coordinate singularities appearing in the metric , eqn .",
    "( [ bmetric ] ) .",
    "strong gravity limits the maximal possible mass of the star when the internal pressure becomes inevitably smaller than the strength of gravity .",
    "the result is the chandrasekhar / tov mass limit of a degenerate star .",
    "certainly , when the self - gravity is strong , the basic fermionic operator , @xmath35 , must interact strongly to one another , changing the conformal dimension of the composite multitrace operator , @xmath34 , in the process .",
    "there has been attempt to find a new conformal dimension of the strongly coupled composite operator in order to match with the mass of the ads star in the presence of strong self - gravity  @xcite . apparently in the newtonian limit",
    ", the self - gravity contributes a negative amount of mass , roughly @xmath88 which corresponds to correction to the conformal dimension @xmath89 in the t hooft limit since @xmath90 .",
    "we also have to multiply bulk energy by @xmath14 in order to obtain the conformal dimension according to eqn .",
    "( [ corr ] ) .",
    "consquently , the conformal dimension of @xmath34 corresponding to the bulk mass of the ads star in the presence of self - gravity becomes approximately @xmath91 on the boundary , the change in the conformal dimension of the composite operator @xmath34 is due to the 4-point interaction between the constituent operator @xmath35 which can be extracted from the ope of the 4-point function of the operator @xmath35 . at the leading order of @xmath92-expansion  ( @xmath93central charge of the boundary cft ) ,",
    "the interaction is the exchange of the stress tensor as well as its crossing channel and thus it is _ universal _ just like gravity in the bulk .",
    "when the radius of ads space is large , the central charge of the dual cft , @xmath94 will be large .",
    "if @xmath95 are fixed , the fermionic operator @xmath35 can be approximated by a  free field \" with negligible interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "if we also scale @xmath96 to be a finite constant not much different from @xmath97 , we will have @xmath98 in the bulk from eqn .",
    "( [ bmetric ] ) , this would correspond to the situation where self - gravity of the bulk fermion gas can no longer be neglected .",
    "namely , @xmath99 in this  double scaling limit \"  @xcite , since @xmath100 we have @xmath101 therefore @xmath102 or @xmath103 where eqn .",
    "( [ corr]),([cft mass ] ) , and ( [ app ] ) have been used .",
    "it also implies the scaling of the total particle number , eqn .",
    "( [ nf ] ) , with respect to the central charge @xmath104 in the bulk picture , the scaling @xmath105 corresponds to the relation @xmath106 which demands that as @xmath107 , the newton constant must scale as @xmath108 in any dimensions . by requiring the invariance of the bulk equations of motion eqn .",
    "( [ eom of m ] ) , ( [ eom of mu ] ) , ( [ bmetric ] ) and ( [ frho ] ) under scaling @xmath109 , the scales must satisfy the relations @xmath110 choosing @xmath111 and applying @xmath112 result in the relation @xmath113 for a fixed @xmath30 , this is exact regardless of @xmath14 as long as we choose @xmath114 .",
    "for large @xmath14 , we have @xmath115 on the boundary cft .",
    "consequently for a given @xmath30 , we can choose sufficiently large @xmath14 so that @xmath116 is larger than @xmath30 .",
    "another prediction is that @xmath117 since both quantities are of order @xmath118 and the constant @xmath119 are not sensitive to @xmath30  ( when @xmath30 is small ) .",
    "we will see that this is actually the case when we numerically calculate the mass limit and @xmath66 of the ads star with self - gravity in the next section , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mlimn ] .",
    "generically , the ads / cft correspondence should be valid even when @xmath14 is fixed to some finite constant . in this section we will explore this possibility by setting @xmath120 and argue that it could lead to the quark - gluon plasma with negative heat capacity .",
    "increasing @xmath14 will increase the mass limit of the fermion star for a fixed @xmath30 but we can always increase @xmath30 so that the mass limit becomes substantially smaller , even smaller than @xmath30 itself . in this section , we numerically solve the coupled equations of motion , eqn .",
    "( [ eom of m ] ) , ( [ eom of mu ] ) , by setting @xmath121 . as long as we keep @xmath122 fixed at a specific value of @xmath30 ,",

    "first , the mass limit of the ads star is found to be a decreasing function of @xmath30 as shown in fig .",

    "even massive fermions at zero temperature are forced to possess kinetic energy due to exclusion principle and thus they inevitably exert pressure against the gravity . as @xmath126 , most of the energy of the fermions becomes kinetic , resulting in the highest possible degenerate pressure and mass limit .",
    "higher pressure also implies bigger star as we can see from fig .",
    "another crucial feature is that the mass limit is not sensitive to @xmath30 when @xmath30 is small as we can see from the saturation of the mass limit for @xmath126 and ever increasing @xmath127 .     and",

    "ads star with large @xmath30 has lower mass limit and smaller radius .",
    "there is a possibility for @xmath130 as @xmath30 increases .",

    "the lesser the conformal dimension of the constituent fermionic operator @xmath35 , the higher the conformal dimension of the composite @xmath34 before the deconfinement occurs .",
    "existence of the upper bound implies that the deconfinement is inevitable provided that the energy density  ( and consequently @xmath137 ) is sufficiently large . injecting mass to the bulk until it exceeds the mass limit and the ads star inevitably collapses corresponds to the deconfinement of the cft matter on the ads boundary when the energy density exceeds a critical value  ( larger and larger number of @xmath35 accumulates to form @xmath34 until reaching critical value ) .      at center of the star , gravitational force from both the ads background and the self - gravity become zero .",
