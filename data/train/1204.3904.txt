    "both remain unresolved .",
    "there has recently been progress towards reducing the @xmath0 problem to a seemingly simpler problem .",

    "a set of positive integers @xmath6 is said to be _ sufficient _ if for every positive integer @xmath4 , there is an element @xmath23 that merges with @xmath4 . notice that to prove the @xmath0 conjecture , it suffices to show that the @xmath1-orbit of every element of some sufficient set @xmath6 contains @xmath2 since every integer that merges with an element of @xmath6",
    "must also enter the cycle @xmath24 as well . in @xcite",
    ", the third author shows that every arithmetic sequence is sufficient .",
    "we can visualize these notions by drawing a directed graph associated to the dynamical system @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and define the @xmath0 _ graph _ @xmath27 to be the two - colored directed graph on the positive integers having a black edge from @xmath4 to @xmath28 if @xmath29 , and a red edge ( which are also dashed in the images in this paper for the benefit of those reading a black and white printout ) from @xmath4 to @xmath28 if @xmath30 .",
    "( see figure [ fig : g ] . )",
    "then two integers merge if and only if they are in the same connected component of @xmath27 , and a sufficient set is a set of nodes which intersects every connected component of @xmath27 .",

    ", we write `` @xmath31 '' in place of `` @xmath32 '' throughout . using this notation",
    ", we recall the well - known fact that if @xmath33 , then the only way to form a back tracing path starting from @xmath4 is by applying @xmath34 repeatedly , forming a single reverse chain of black arrows in @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , every element of this chain is also divisible by @xmath35 .",
    "conversely , every positive integer @xmath4 forward traces to a number that is not divisible by @xmath35 , at which point all future points in its orbit are not divisible by @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the back tracing paths from multiples of @xmath35 are well - understood , and for convenience we also define the _ pruned _ @xmath0 _ graph _ , denoted @xmath36 , to be the subgraph of @xmath27 consisting of the positive integers relatively prime to @xmath35 .",
    "a portion of the @xmath37@xmath36 is illustrated in figure [ fig : gpruned ] .    in @xcite , in order to prove that every arithmetic sequence is sufficient , the third author shows that for any positive integers @xmath38 and @xmath39 and for every node @xmath4 in the pruned @xmath0 graph @xmath36 , there is a back tracing path from @xmath4 to some @xmath20 in @xmath27 with @xmath40 .",
    "( since any @xmath4 in the general @xmath0 graph has a forward tracing path to some @xmath41 in the pruned graph , this shows that every @xmath4 in @xmath27 merges with some @xmath20 in the given arithmetic sequence . ) in section [ efficient ] , we strengthen these results by finding bounds on the minimum number of red arrows needed to back trace from any positive integer @xmath4 to an integer @xmath20 in a desired arithmetic sequence .",
    "these results rely on an understanding of the @xmath0 groups @xmath42 generated by @xmath43 and @xmath44 modulo an integer @xmath7 relatively prime to @xmath8 .",
    "we completely classify these groups in section [ groups ] .    for specific moduli @xmath39",
    ", we can obtain even stronger and more surprising results . in section [ inverselimits ] , we describe infinite back tracing paths as elements of an inverse limit and show that every such back tracing path must contain an integer congruent to @xmath45 mod @xmath46 .",
    "we use similar methods to show that in fact every @xmath1-orbit of positive integers must also contain an element congruent to @xmath45 mod @xmath46 . for this reason ,",
    "we say that the set of integers congruent to @xmath45 mod @xmath46 is _",
    "strongly sufficient_.    in section [ forward ] , we define @xmath47 to be the finite directed graph obtained by taking the @xmath0 graph @xmath27 mod @xmath39 .",
    "we use these graphs to determine graph - theoretic criteria for a set to be strongly sufficient , and we provide several families of such sets @xmath6 that must intersect every nontrivial @xmath1-orbit or infinite back tracing path .",
    "we also demonstrate that finding strongly sufficient sets is a plausible way to approach the nontrivial cycles conjecture .    finally ,",
    "in section [ dualityfolding ] , we show that the graphs @xmath48 exhibit a surprising and beautiful self - duality ( given by a map first defined in @xcite ) and that these are the only @xmath47 having this property .",
    "we also use results from @xcite and @xcite to show that for any @xmath13 , one can fold @xmath48 onto @xmath49 in a natural way .",
    "we combine these deeper tools with our results on strong sufficiency to obtain an infinite family of strongly sufficient sets consisting of unions of residue classes modulo a power of @xmath45 .",
    "since every arithmetic sequence is sufficient , the arithmetic sequences form a family of sufficient sets with members having arbitrarily small positive density in the integers .",
    "it is natural to ask if there is a sufficient set of density zero in the positive integers .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative as follows .    for any function @xmath50 and any positive integers @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the set of integers",
    "@xmath51 is a sufficient set .",
    "we know that the set @xmath52 is sufficient .",
    "so , given a positive integer @xmath4 , there is a number of the form @xmath53 that merges with @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the positive integer @xmath54 , which maps to @xmath53 after @xmath55 iterations of @xmath1 , also merges with @xmath4 .",
    "this completes the proof .    by taking @xmath56 to be sufficiently large relative to @xmath12",
    ", we can use this to produce infinitely many sufficient sets of density zero in the positive integers .",
    "we state one family of these below .    for any fixed @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "the sequence @xmath57 is a sufficient set with asymptotic density zero in the positive integers .",
    "thus , to prove the @xmath0 conjecture , it suffices to show that the @xmath1-orbit of every number in the density - zero set @xmath58 contains @xmath2 .",
    "this method can also be used to find arbitrarily sparse sufficient sets containing only odd numbers ( for example , the set @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "notice , however , that the elements of any such sufficient sets eventually map to @xmath62 , so one still effectively needs to show that the elements of the arithmetic sequence @xmath63 map to @xmath2 under @xmath1 .",
    "thus we turn our attention to this problem next by investigating the actual distribution of such sequences in the @xmath0 graph .",
    "for any positive integer @xmath7 relatively prime to @xmath8 , the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 act as permutations on @xmath64 .",
    "we begin by completely classifying the permutation groups @xmath42 generated by these two permutations .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the cyclic group of order @xmath66 . also let @xmath67 be the group of affine maps mod @xmath7 under composition , and note that @xmath42 can be viewed as the subgroup of @xmath68 generated by @xmath25 and @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , the subgroup @xmath70 is isomorphic to the cyclic group @xmath71 , and is a normal subgroup of @xmath68 .",
    "it will also be useful to consider the element @xmath72 of @xmath42 .",
    "[ structure ] let @xmath7 be a positive integer relatively prime to 2 and 3 . write the prime factorization @xmath73 . for all @xmath74 , let @xmath75 be the multiplicative order of @xmath76 , let @xmath77 be the multiplicative order of @xmath78 , and",
    "let @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath80 where @xmath81    in the statement above , the action on @xmath71 defining the semidirect product is the action of @xmath68 by conjugation on the subgroup @xmath82    in @xcite , it was shown that the function @xmath72 is an element of the group generated by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this function clearly has order @xmath7 and generates the cyclic subgroup @xmath83 .",
    "this is a normal subgroup , since it is a fixed set under conjugation .    since @xmath84 is in @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "can be expressed in terms of the maps @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , we have that @xmath87 as a subgroup of @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be generated using @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath90 , so in fact @xmath91 the first generator corresponds to the cyclic subgroup @xmath71 .",
    "we now only need to see what we obtain from multiplication by @xmath45 and @xmath35 .    by the chinese remainder theorem , we have @xmath92 .",
    "thus we can look at the action of multiplication by @xmath45 and @xmath35 on each component , and the action on the whole group @xmath42 will be the direct product of each of these .",
    "let @xmath93 and @xmath94 be the corresponding exponent . since @xmath7 is relatively prime to @xmath45 , we know that @xmath95 is an odd prime .",
    "thus @xmath96 , the group of units of @xmath97 , is cyclic .",
    "let @xmath98 be the order of @xmath45 and @xmath99 the order of @xmath35 in @xmath96 .",
    "since the subgroup lattice of @xmath96 is isomorphic to the divisor lattice of @xmath100 , we have that @xmath101 , which concludes the proof .",
    "while theorem [ structure ] describes the overall structure of the groups , it would be useful to understand it as a finitely generated group in terms of the generators @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( mod @xmath7 ) .",
    "we begin by calculating the orders of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in @xmath42 .",
    "to do so , we introduce the auxiliary function @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and define @xmath105 by @xmath106    let @xmath107 .",
    "then straightforward calculation shows that @xmath108 , and in particular that @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the @xmath102-orbit of a positive integer @xmath111 can be obtained by taking the @xmath1-orbit of @xmath112 and adding @xmath2 to each element of the orbit .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 conjecture is equivalent to showing that the @xmath102-orbit of any positive integer @xmath111 contains the integer @xmath45 .",

    "one divides by @xmath45 and rounds up to the nearest integer , and repeats the process .",

    "in particular , the conjugacy sends @xmath43 to @xmath120 and @xmath44 to @xmath121 .",
    "now , the order of @xmath44 in @xmath42 is equal to the order of @xmath121 in @xmath42 by the conjugacy , and the order of @xmath121 is equal to the order of @xmath118 modulo @xmath7 ( since @xmath122 ) .",
    "this completes the proof .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath42 acts transitively on @xmath64 , by showing that the map @xmath72 is in @xmath42 .",
