    "k - dimensional tree ( kd - tree ) , as a computer science term , is a space - partitioning data structure for organizing points in a @xmath0-dimensional space ( bentley , 1975 ) .",
    "technically , the letter @xmath0 refers to the numbers of dimensions .",
    "a 3-dimensional kd - tree can be called as @xmath1-tree .",
    "a kd - tree organizes datapoints in such a way that once built , whenever a query arrives requesting a list all points in a neighborhood , the query can be answered quickly without needing to scan every single point .",
    "each tree node represents a subvolume of the parameter space , with the root node containing the entire @xmath0 dimensional volume spanned by the data .",
    "non - leaf nodes have two children , obtained by splitting the widest dimension of the parent s bounding box , the left child owning those data points that are strictly less than the splitting value in the splitting dimension , and the right child owning the remainder of the parent s data points .",
    "a kd - tree is usually constructed top - down , beginning with the full set of points and then splitting in the center of the widest dimension .",
    "this produces two child nodes , each with a distinct set of points .",
    "repeat this procedure recursively ; a kd - tree can be constructed .",
    "kd - trees have been successfully applied in astronomy for some problems .",
    "hsieh et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the kd - tree algorithm to divide up their sample to improve the redshift accuracy of galaxies .",
    "the kd - tree method is used on the 5 flux - space indexing in the sdss science archive to partition the bulk data ( kunszt et  al . 2000 ) . in the following ,",
    "we give three kinds of case studies with kd - trees .",
    "the cross - identification of catalogues from different bands , especially from large survey projects , is the bottleneck of multi - wavelength astronomical research , especially for data mining and statistical study .",
    "jim gray ( 2005 ) present some performance tests that using zoning algorithm to facilitate large - scale query and cross - match .",
    "power et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) introduce the plane sweep technique to solve cross - matching problems with huge catalogues , such as 2mass , tycho-2 , usnob1.0 and so on .    in some previous cross - match jobs , one object from catalogue a needs to check with all the objects from catalogue b to obtain matching counterparts ,",
    "this requires a spatial join between tables in databases .",
    "since the computational complexity of these cross - match algorithms are o(@xmath2 ) , major issues such as memory limit and speed bottleneck are involved and make huge catalogues cross - identification infeasible .",
    "so we introduce the hierarchical triangular mesh ( htm , http://skyserver.org/htm/ ) spatial index algorithm , and it gives a very efficient indexing method for objects localized on the sphere .",
    "moreover , kd - tree algorithm has been involved to solve a near neighbor problem for huge catalogs cross - identification .",
    "our solution is as follows : we firstly divide the sky into small equal triangles by htm , and then for each triangle we build a kd - tree and find the nearest neighbor , and finally we judge whether the nearest object is the cross - match counterpart",
    ". assumed that there are two tables : table a and table b , and the record number in table a is smaller than that in table b. we map each object ( ra , dec ) to a htm index number for each catalogue table and divide the sky into equal triangles .",
    "for each triangle , we insert objects from table b into a kd - tree and build it , and then for each object from table a we find the nearest neighbor or nearest n neighbors in the kd - tree . finally , we can determine whether the neighbor object is the association by analyzing the distribution of distances between the object from table a and the neighbor object from table b , and corresponds to 3@xmath3 cutoff ( zhang , 2003 ) .",
    "table 1 listed some applications of huge catalog cross - match using the above method .",
    "for example , the matching of sdss spectroscopic quasar sample with 2mass catalogue takes 5,033 seconds .",
    "the result indicated that cross - matching two catalogues consisting of half a million or ten million objects can be achieved in around one hour .",
    "when one of the catalogues consists of a billion or ten billion objects the total time taken is about 10 hours or one day .",

    "we collected photometric data of quasars and stars with spectra measurement from sdss dr5 . after crossing out the missing data",
    ", we obtained the sample contains 76,949 quasars and 108,744 stars .",
    "train - test method is used to divide the sample into two parts : 124,415 for training a classifier and 61,281 for testing the classifier to get the classification rate .",
    "we use two different magnitudes : model magnitudes and model magnitudes with reddening correction ( hereafter short for dereddened magnitudes ) from sdss data .",
    "the four model color index ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and the model @xmath8 magnitude are taken as the first set of input parameters for kd - tree , and then the four dereddened colors and the dereddened @xmath8 magnitude are as input patterns .",
    "the results are given in table 2 . when considering model magnitudes , the accuracy of quasars and stars are 96.41% and 97.87% , respectively .",
    "the accuracy is 96.37% for quasars and 97.76% for stars given dereddened magnitudes .",
    "for the two input patterns , the total accuracy is 97.26% and 97.19% , respectively .",
    "therefore , we summarized that the performance of the input pattern based on model magnitudes adds up to a higher accuracy than that based on dereddened magnitudes . for any input pattern ,",
    "the accuracy is rather high , more than 97% , and the running time is not more than 1 minute . in table 2 , we concluded that a kd - tree shows its superiority to separate quasars from stars in respect of both accuracy and speed . as a result , the classifiers trained with kd - tree can be used to classify the unclassified sources and be applicable to preselect quasar candidates for large surveys , such as the chinese large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ) .",

    "we collected photometric data of galaxies with spectra measurement from sdss dr5 .",
    "the outlying data and the missing data are crossed out . in order to estimate photometric redshifts of galaxies derived from sdss dr5",
    ", we obtained all objects satisfying the following criteria ( vanzella et al .",
    "2004 ) : ( 1 ) @xmath8-band petrosian magnitude @xmath11 17.77 ; ( 2 ) the spectroscopic redshift confidence must be greater than 0.95 and there must be no warning flags . this led to 375,929 galaxies , which are randomly partitioned into training set ( 251,872 ) and test set ( 124,057 ) . in this experiment , we directly used the four dereddened colors as input pattern , and then we adopted the four dereddened colors and the dereddened @xmath8 magnitude as the input of kd - tree .    the dispersion ( @xmath12 ) with each set of parameters to estimate photometric redshifts are listed in table 3 . when taking @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 as inputs , the rms scatter in testing set is 0.0212 . when taking @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as inputs , the rms error is up to 0.0232 .",

    "from the case studies , it is concluded that kd - trees have a wide application in astronomy due to its own characteristics .",
    "kd - trees are useful data structure for many applications , such as searches involving a multi - dimensional search key .",
    "therefore many researches related to optional and fast search may be searched with the kd - tree approach . with the increase of astronomical data in volume",
