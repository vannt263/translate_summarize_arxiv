    "massive stars play an important rle in galactic evolution .",
    "they deposit chemically enriched matter , momentum and ionizing photons into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and their demise as supernovae may trigger or quench star formation in their vicinity . because of their rapid evolution it is difficult to study the formation of massive stars . until the protostar has become hot enough to create an ( ultra - compact ) hii region it remains hidden from view inside its dust cocoon ( e.g. , walmsley 1995 ; garay & lizano 1999 ) . studying the formation of massive stars in nearby , metal - poor environments",
    "has the advantage of reduced attenuation by dust , as the dust - to - gas ratio is a function of the metal abundance .",
    "an important scientific reason for studying massive star formation at low metallicity is that it may be more representative of the early evolution of the universe .",
    "surveys for extra - galactic pre - main sequence stars have so far concentrated on prominent hii regions in the magellanic clouds .",
    "optical and near - ir images reveal young stellar objects ( ysos ) that have just emerged from their dust cocoon or are in the process of doing so ( rubio et al .  1998 ;",
    "walborn et al .",
    "1999 ; brandner et al .",
    "2001 ; romaniello , robberto & panagia 2004 ) .",
    "embedded ysos have been found by their dust emission at thermal - ir wavelengths or via maser emission at radio wavelengths ( whiteoak et al .",

    "the mid - ir point source iras05328@xmath06827 is seen in the direction of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , at ra@xmath4 and dec@xmath5 ( j2000 ) . on the basis of its near - ir colours and msx 8.28 @xmath6 m flux density",
    "it was selected as a target for our thermal - ir spectroscopic programme with the eso - vlt and spitzer space telescope of evolved stars in the magellanic clouds . here",
    "we present evidence for it to be a massive yso instead .",
    "we present and analyse the spectra and the spectral energy distribution , the first detailed investigation of an extra - galactic yso .",
    "the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .  2004 ) on - board the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) was used on 15 february 2005 to take a low - resolution spectrum ( @xmath7 ) of iras05328@xmath06827 between 5.2 and @xmath8 @xmath6 m , as part of cycle 1 programme # 3505 .",
    "the star was acquired on the slit after peak - up in the red ( 22 @xmath6 m ) on the target itself .",
    "the spectra were taken in staring mode , placing the target on different positions on the slit to facilitate removal of sky emission .",
    "the spectral segments received a total integration of 28 , 28 , 60 and 420 seconds for respectively sl order 2 ( 5.28.7 @xmath6 m ) , sl order 1 ( 7.414.5 @xmath6 m ) , ll order 2 ( 14.021.3 @xmath6 m ) and ll order 1 ( 19.538.0 @xmath6 m ) .",
    "the spectral segments were combined by making corrections for pointing - induced throughput errors , normalizing to the best centered segment .",
    "the accuracy of the overall spectral shape is a few per cent .",
    "the reduction , extraction and calibration of the spectrum followed closely the procedures described in sloan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the isaac instrument on the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) , chile , was used on 7 december 2003 to obtain a long - slit spectrum between 2.85 and 4.15 @xmath6 m .",
    "the resolving power of @xmath9 was set by the @xmath10 seeing rather than the @xmath11 slit width .",
    "the thermal - ir technique of chopping and nodding was used , with a throw of @xmath12 and jittering by small amounts , to remove the background .",
    "the spectra were extracted using an optimal extraction algorithm .",
    "an internal xe+ar lamp was used for wavelength calibration the relative spectral response was calibrated by dividing by the spectrum of the b - type standard star hip020020 .",
    "this removed most of the telluric absorption lines but introduced artificial emission features due to the photospheric lines of hip020020 .",
    "the spectrum of iras05328@xmath06827 was therefore multiplied by a hot blackbody continuum with gausian - shaped absorption lines of br@xmath13 4.052 , pf@xmath14 3.741 , pf@xmath15 3.297 , pf@xmath16 3.039 and pf@xmath17 2.873 @xmath6 m scaled to match those in hip020020 .",

    "the irs red peak - up image provided photometry at 22 @xmath6 m ( between 18.5 and 26 @xmath6 m ) . the individual , shifted integrations were combined to remove bad pixels , and aperture photometry was obtained assuming a calibration of 1.16 data numbers @xmath6jy@xmath22 for a 4-pixel aperture radius .    all the available photometry is listed in table 1 .",

    "compared to 30 doradus , located almost a degree to the south - east , and the hii region lha 120-n44 , to the north - west , n148 is not very bright but it does extend almost half a degree in diameter .",
    "optical images are suggestive of the presence of a large dark cloud immediately to the north .",
    "n148a seems to be disjoint from the rest of n148 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for severe interstellar reddening of stars in the nebula .",
    "iras05328@xmath06827 is a bright object in the @xmath23-band and in the irs red peak - up image at 22 @xmath6 m ( shown in fig .  2 in vertical alignment with , and at an identical spatial scale as the optical and @xmath23-band images ) .",
    "the blue peak - up image at 16 @xmath6 m ( shown in fig .  2 in its true position relative to the red peak - up image ) happened to catch the two other bright mid - ir sources in this region , iras05330@xmath06826 and msxlmc1780 ( both are easily visible in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the nature of msxlmc1780 is unclear , but iras05330@xmath06826 coincides with an anonymous cluster of stars embedded within the h@xmath13 nebulosity .",
    "the mid - ir emission might arise from circumstellar material of cluster pre - main sequence stars or from diffuse dust that is heated up by the young stars .",
    "neither @xmath24co@xmath25 ( israel et al .",
    "1993 ) nor radio emission ( marx , dickey & mebold 1997 ) is detected from iras05328@xmath06827 .",
    "the lack of radio emission ( at a level of 6 mjy at 1.4 ghz or 3 mjy at 2.4 ghz ) rules out the possibility that iras05328@xmath06827 is an ultra - compact hii region ( cf .",
    "zijlstra 1990 ) unless it is optically thick at those wavelengths .",
    "interestingly , very weak co and radio emission at 1.4 ghz is detected from iras05330@xmath06826 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was reproduced with the dust radiative transfer model dusty ( ivezi , nenkova & elitzur 1999 ) , as a first attempt at deriving quantitative information about this yso .",
    "the fit is shown along with the observed sed in fig .",
    "we placed a blackbody with an effective temperature of 30,000 k in the centre of a spherically symmetric dust cloud . for a distance to the lmc of 50 kpc the integrated sed yields a bolometric luminosity of 40,000 l@xmath2 .",
    "this would correspond to a late - o type , 20 m@xmath2 zero - age main - sequence star ( hanson , howarth & conti 1997 ) .",
    "although the model does not fit the sed in perfect detail , the bolometric luminosity is recovered with about 10 per cent accuracy .    for the radial profile of the density in the dust cloud we adopted a single power law of the form @xmath26 .",
    "such a flat profile is consistent with an accreting yso ( osorio , lizano & dalessio 1999 ) or with a flattened geometry much alike that of a disc ( e.g. , whitney et al .",
    "the dust cloud extends from an inner radius of a few hundred au , at which the dust temperature reaches 800 k , to an outer radius of about one parsec . the model fit uses oxygen - rich cold silicates ( ossenkopf , henning & mathis 1992 ) with a uniform grain size of 0.07 @xmath6 m , and requires an extinction of @xmath27 mag",
    ".    an improved fit of a spherically symmetric model to the sed can not be achieved without invoking a two - component model , with a warm inner dust shell and a cold outer envelope .",
    "however , the geometry in massive ysos is almost certainly not spherically symmetric .",
    "the present data are unable to constrain detailed models .",
    "the 2.94.1 @xmath6 m vlt / isaac spectrum and 5.236 @xmath6 m spitzer / irs spectrum are displayed in fig .",
    "we define _ ad hoc _ continua ( dotted lines ) and compute the optical depths with respect to this pseudo - continuum ( fig .",
    "although this has little meaning for the dust features it facilitates computing column densities for the molecular ices .",
    "the absence of any atomic emission lines ( fig .",
    "4 ) makes it unlikely that an advanced ionized region is present .",
    "we estimate upper limits to individual hydrogen and helium emission line fluxes of @xmath28 w m@xmath29 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath30 w ( = 1.5 l@xmath2 ) or @xmath31 s@xmath22 . in a case",
    "b scenario , in which all lines except ly@xmath13 are optically thin , the strongest line in the 2.94.1 @xmath6 m region is expected to be br@xmath13 . the br@xmath13:br@xmath14 intensity ratio is @xmath32 ( storey & hummer 1995 ) and by scaling we obtain an upper limit of @xmath33 w to the br@xmath14 luminosity .",
    "this is a typical value for detected br@xmath14 in galactic massive ysos but it is not unusual for it to be weaker ( ishii et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the heavily smoothed vlt / isaac spectrum ( fig .",
    "5 ) shows absorption by h@xmath3o ( water ) ice around 3.1 @xmath6 m .",
    "there is also evidence for absorption by ch@xmath34oh ( methanol ) ice at 3.4 and 3.5 @xmath6 m .",
    "the 3.4 @xmath6 m absorption in galactic ysos often peaks at 3.47 @xmath6 m , but a peak around 3.40 @xmath6 m as seen in iras05328@xmath06827 is predicted if relatively little h@xmath3o and h@xmath3co ( formaldehyde ) ice is present ( schutte et al .",
    "related features might be detected at 3.85 and 3.95 @xmath6 m ( dartois et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the optical depth ratio at 3.1 and 3.47 @xmath6 m is with @xmath32 an order of magnitude smaller than observed in galactic ysos ( brooke , sellgren & geballe 1999 ) .",
    "there is clear evidence for absorption at 15.2 @xmath6 m due to co@xmath3 ice ( fig.5 ) ; both the position and shape are identical to that seen in the galactic massive yso w33a ( boogert et al .",
    "co@xmath3 ice is expected in a low - mass embedded yso ( bergin et al .",
    "2005 ) , but it is often relatively weak in _ massive _ ysos ( watson et al .  2004 ) unless significant processing has occurred ( gibb et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the integrated optical depths @xmath35 ( wavenumber @xmath36 ) of the ice features are converted into column densities by division through by the integrated absorbance values from hudgins et al .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath37h@xmath3o@xmath38 cm@xmath29 , and relative abundances of approximately h@xmath3o : ch@xmath34oh : co@xmath3=2:3:1 .",
    "although these abundances come with considerable uncertainty , ch@xmath34oh seems to be more abundant than co@xmath3 and h@xmath3o is clearly under - abundant .",
    "the galactic massive ysos w33a and afgl7009s also have an exceptionally high ch@xmath34oh abundance , but only marginally higher than the co@xmath3 abundance and a few times below that of h@xmath3o ( dartois et al .",
    "iras05328@xmath06827 may thus present an extreme case of processing of the ice mantles on the dust grains ( cf .",
    "gibb et al.2004 ) .",
    "we speculate that the low metallicity in the lmc may lead to a less tenuous dust environment surrounding ysos , allowing interstellar photons to penetrate deeper and to be scattered around within the extended envelope .",
    "the photons can then affect the ice coatings on the grain surfaces .",
    "the lower oxygen abundance and possibly higher c / o ratio in the ism of the lmc may also have an effect on the chemical balance in ysos .",
    "the observed opacity ratio of the 18 and 10 @xmath6 m silicate components exceeds any that could be reproduced using the optical constants available to us .",
    "this ratio is known to be high at the low temperatures encountered in the ism and star forming regions , as compared to the warm circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars ( ossenkopf et al .",
    "1992 ; suh 1999 ) .",
    "it goes beyond the present analysis to design a grain with matching optical properties .",
    "we have discovered a massive young stellar object , iras05328@xmath06827 , in the lmc hii region lha120-n148 .",
    "we present spectra at 2.94.1 @xmath6 m obtained with the eso - vlt and at 5.236 @xmath6 m obtained with the spitzer space telescope : the first thermal - ir spectra of an extra - galactic yso .",
    "this opens the way to studying the early stages of massive star formation under unique environmental conditions ( e.g. , at low metallicity ) not encountered in the milky way .",
    "iras05328@xmath06827 is a luminous ( @xmath40 l@xmath2 ) , massive ( 20 m@xmath2 ) yso embedded in an optically thick dust cloud .",
    "its sed is reminiscent of class i or flat - spectrum sources , and shows absorption features of silicate dust and ices .",
    "there is no sign yet of an emerging hii region .    at the lower metallicity in the lmc ,",
    "compared to star forming regions in the milky way ( by about a factor 4 , koornneef 1982 ) , the lower dust content has two effects : ( i ) it becomes easier for the observer to detect the inner , accreting part of the cloud core , and ( ii ) interstellar radiation can penetrate deeper into the cloud and affect the ice mantles on the dust grains .",
    "together with a higher carbon : oxygen ratio this might be responsible for the observed low h@xmath3o ice abundance and high ch@xmath34oh abundance .",
    "we thank the referee for her / his very helpful suggestions .",
    "jo and mm acknowledge support from pparc . prw has received funding for this work from the australian research council .",
