    "the canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite is successful in generating small masses of left - handed neutrinos , but it has no direct experimental testability and encounters a potential hierarchy problem @xcite . in the type - i seesaw model with heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath5 ,",
    "the left - handed neutrinos @xmath6 can gain small masses @xmath7 thanks to the huge right - handed neutrino masses @xmath8 .",
    "however , to obtain @xmath9 , one has to require @xmath10 , if @xmath11 is assumed to be at the electroweak scale ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this makes the right - handed neutrinos far beyond the detectability of any colliders .",
    "the hierarchy problem is that a very high seesaw scale will lead to large corrections to the higgs mass , which makes the higgs mass of the order of the electroweak scale unnatural .",
    "the inverse seesaw model @xcite can solve these problems .",

    "the lagrangian in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors @xcite is written as @xmath17 in which @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for the higgs doublet , three lepton doublets and three charged - lepton singlets , respectively in the sm and @xmath21 .",

    "it is confirmed by the reno experiment @xcite .",
    "the experimental results of large @xmath4 give us two motivations for the utzt .",
    "( 1 ) two phenomenological strategies towards understanding lepton flavor mixing are outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite : the first one is to start from a nearly constant flavor mixing pattern , and the second one is to associate the mixing angles with the lepton mass ratios .",
    "while it is a nontrivial job to generate a large @xmath4 from the first strategy according to flavor symmetries , one may pay more attention to the second strategy . to implement the second strategy ,",
    "one generally requires some elements of @xmath37 and @xmath38 to be zeros or sufficiently small compared with their neighbors , and the two - zero texture is a typical example of this kind .",
    "( 2 ) as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath37 is diagonal and @xmath35 has a two - zero texture , it is more likely to obtain a large @xmath4 if @xmath35 has texture zeros as in eq .",
    "( 3 ) compared with the other texture zeros . taking advantage of this kind of texture zeros , we expand our discussion to the scenario that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 have such texture zeros .",
    "we expect that such texture can also gain a large @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we propose a model to connect the gism with the utzt under the discrete abelian group @xmath2 . with this model",
    ", we can realize the two - zero textures of @xmath37 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath39 and @xmath25 .",
    "however , the realization of the two - zero texture of @xmath35 is a little non - trivial .",
    "section 3 is devoted to see how the two - zero texture of @xmath35 is realized . in section 4 , the utzt is used to explain the lepton flavor mixing , especially for large @xmath4 .",
    "both analytical and numerical results are presented .",
    "the predictions for the effective masses in the tritium beta decay and neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath43 ) decay are also given in this section .",
    "since the utzt in the general case has several adjustable parameters , it does not get stringent experimental constraints . in section 5",
    ", we consider two ans@xmath3tze of the utzt to constrain the parameter space .",
    "ansatz ( a ) is a natural approximation based on our model built in section 2 , and ansatz ( b ) is a special case which has been considered in ref .",
    "section 6 is the conclusion of our paper .",
    "in this section , we illustrate a way to connect the gism with the utzt .",
    "we rewrite the lagrangian in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors as @xmath44 in which the repeated indices are summed . in our model , we introduce three scalars into each term , so @xmath45 . comparing eq .",

    "we obtain the lightest neutrino mass @xmath309 ev .",

    "the effective mass @xmath310 in the @xmath43 decay can maximally reach 0.001 ev .",
    "\\(3 ) we have compared two ans@xmath3tze of the utzt .",
    "ansatz ( a ) is a natural approximation of our model built in section 2 , and ansatz ( b ) is a special case which has been considered in ref .",
    "the mixing angles in ansatz ( a ) fit the experimental constraints quite well , while in ansatz ( b ) , @xmath300 and @xmath301 are allowed , and @xmath311 is preferred .",
    "ansatz ( b ) predicts the effective mass @xmath312 in the @xmath43 decay experiments , while ansatz ( a ) can only predict @xmath208 one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that in ansatz ( b ) .",
    "finally , we stress that the gism can avoid the hierarchy problem and is testable in collider experiments , and the utzt agrees very well with current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "both the gism and utzt can be realized from the same abelian symmetry due to their similar structures , although their uniqueness connot easily be verified in the bottom - up approach of model building .",
    "except for the above discussions , there are some other interesting aspects of the gism and utzt in neutrino phenomenology .",
    "one is to discuss possible collider signatures of the tev - scale right - handed or additional gauge - singlet neutrinos in the gism , which could be explored by the large hadron collider .",
    "another aspect is related to the baryogenesis via leptogenesis , so as to account for the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "the two - zero textures of the yukawa coupling matrices and the uncertainty of the scales of @xmath8 and @xmath25 may affect how the leptogenesis mechanism works in the early universe .",

    "for instance , assuming @xmath330 , @xmath331 and @xmath332 , we obtain @xmath333 .",
