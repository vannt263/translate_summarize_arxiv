    "<S> a qubit basis formed by a pair of orthogonal quantum states is central to quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> currently there is considerable effort towards implementing quantum information processing with two - level systems . for such systems , </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing and fundamental fact is that quantum mechanics prohibits the construction of a universal - not gate that would produce an orthogonal qubit from any input qubit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum mechanical property is closely related to the quantum no - cloning theorem  @xcite , however , faithful cloning can be achieved probabilistically provided that the set of input states is linearly independent  @xcite . similarly , using such an input set of states , it is possible to construct a probabilistic not operation for qubits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a qubit basis may , however , also be formed using two orthogonal continuous variable states . </S>",
    "<S> thus far , efforts to construct such a basis have mainly concentrated on using a superposition of coherent states  @xcite . also , recently a qubit basis was realized using photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a method for quantum state orthogonalization for continuous variable quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the method only requires knowing the angle @xmath3 made by the state s mean amplitude @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the annihilation operator , and hence the scheme is magnitude independent . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our method is readily extended to generate an arbitrary superposition of the initial state and an orthogonal counterpart to allow the encoding of quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonalizer @xmath6 is formed by a linear superposition of the bosonic annihilation and creation operators and generates a state orthogonal to any pure state @xmath7 i.e. @xmath8 when @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath10 is a quadrature operator that is perpendicular to @xmath3  @xcite .    the orthogonalizer can be realized with interactions that are available in many physical systems , e.g. , to realize @xmath10 in cavity - quantum - electrodynamics @xcite , one prepares an input qubit in the state @xmath11 which then weakly interacts via the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the coupling rate and @xmath14 are the raising and lowering operators . </S>",

    "<S> can be readily achieved . moreover , a different scheme to perform a superposition of photon subtraction and addition was recently proposed  @xcite , which could also be used to realize state orthogonalization .    </S>",
    "<S> the tools we introduce for orthogonalization can also be utilized for quantum state engineering applications . currently , single - quanta - manipulation techniques performed on traveling light fields  @xcite have prepared superposition states via photon subtraction  @xcite , observed the bosonic commutation relation  @xcite , and engineered arbitrary quantum states up to the two - photon level  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much progress has also been made for arbitrary quantum state preparation of the motion of trapped ions and microwave field states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mechanical elements are now also considered for quantum applications , experimental tools are required for the coherent manipulation of phononic modes . </S>",
    "<S> examples of progress in this direction are the observation of the ground state of motion  @xcite , steps towards single - phonon manipulation by coupling to a superconducting phase qubit  @xcite , strong coupling @xcite , and mechanical mode thermometry via sideband asymmetry  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> _ coherent phonon manipulation. _ in this section we demonstrate how to perform an arbitrary coherent superposition of phonon subtraction , addition and the identity operation to a mechanical oscillator using cavity optomechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the prototypical optomechanical system is a fabry - prot cavity where one of the mirrors is sufficiently compliant that the reflection of light can modify the mirror momentum via radiation - pressure . </S>",
    "<S> concurrently , the motion of the moving mirror modulates the optical phase and generates sidebands . to realize phonon subtraction ( addition ) </S>",
    "<S> one can optically drive an optomechanical cavity at the red ( blue ) sideband and then perform single photon detection on the field scattered onto cavity resonance . </S>",

    "<S> provided that the intracavity intensity varies much slower than the mechanical frequency the mechanical mean amplitude is @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this displacement due to the optical steady state intensity shifts the mean cavity length . </S>",
    "<S> introducing @xmath35 , the intracavity amplitude is @xmath36 , where it has been assumed that @xmath28 varies much slower than @xmath26 . in the proceeding discussion </S>",
    "<S> this change to the detuning is neglected as the effect is small and can be readily compensated by frequency stabilization and/or appropriate pre - detuning . </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to the noise operators and for brevity solve the dynamics for a single drive frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we enter the mechanical and optical rotating frames via @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> we now consider weak drive such that the probability of more than one quanta being scattered is negligible . in this case , from the scattered photon number expectations , we introduce an effective beam - splitter parameter @xmath58 and an effective squeezing parameter @xmath59  @xcite and we describe the interaction using the effective unitary @xmath60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the beam - splitter and two - mode - squeezer phases , respectively , which can be controlled via the phase of the drives . </S>",
    "<S> the fields at cavity resonance generated via @xmath63 are spatially combined and filtered from the drive fields . </S>",
    "<S> next , to control the weighting of identity in the operation a weak displacement of amplitude @xmath64 is performed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> doing this to the @xmath49 polarization , @xmath65 . at this point </S>",

    "<S> this quadrature is depicted in fig .  2 as is its action on a displaced squeezed state . </S>",
    "<S> such orthogonalization is heralded by the detection of a single photon that occurs with probability @xmath77 , which is greater than zero for all physical states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note here that for states with zero phase - space mean , i.e. @xmath78 , one can also interpret these expressions as quanta subtraction or addition to the state @xmath7 yields a state which is orthogonal to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> addition alone can orthogonalize all such states with a heralding probability of @xmath79 whereas subtraction alone has a heralding probability of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus further note that the operations @xmath81 and @xmath82 can orthogonalize all pure states with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> these operations may be simpler to experimentally implement , however , are less versatile as complete information of the state s mean is required as opposed to the partial knowledge required by @xmath10 . returning to ( [ eq : upsh ] ) </S>",

    "<S> a mechanical resonator is a stationary system that allows @xmath72 to be conveniently performed multiple times . </S>",

    "<S> we would also like to emphasize that our scheme is robust against optical loss and inefficient detection as an optomechanically scattered photon that goes undetected does not trigger @xmath72 , hence , the primary effect of loss is to merely reduce the heralding probability  @xcite . to characterize the mechanical motional state , as the parameter regime considered here </S>",
