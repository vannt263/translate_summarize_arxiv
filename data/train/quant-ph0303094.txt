    "a classic result of decoherence theory is the rapid decay in the off - diagonal matrix elements in the coordinate representation of the density operator @xmath1 of a massive brownian particle suffering collisions with the lighter particles of a thermal bath .",
    "early calculations by joos and zeh @xcite were improved by later authors , and the result of gallis and fleming @xcite seems to be the most widely quoted @xcite .",
    "they find , in the limit of an infinitely massive brownian particle , that @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 the mass of the bath particles , @xmath5 their number density , and @xmath6 the fraction of particles with momentum magnitude between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are unit vectors , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the elements of solid angle associated with them .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is the scattering amplitude of a bath particle off the brownian particle from initial momentum @xmath14 to final momentum @xmath15 .",
    "gallis and fleming find @xmath16 .",
    "we show here that this result is incorrect ; the correct result is given by ( [ gamma ] ) with @xmath17 . needless to say",
    ", this difference does not affect the qualitative conclusion that off - diagonal elements decay exceedingly quickly for even macroscopically small @xmath18 . nonetheless , experimental techniques are now available that permit the study of the quantum mechanical loss of coherence by collisions @xcite",
    ". therefore not only a qualitative understanding of decoherence effects is needed , but a quantitatively correct description is required as well .",
    "moreover , derivations of benchmark equations in the theory of decoherence such ( [ drhodt],[gamma ] ) illustrate the nature of the physics and the assumptions involved , and uncovering the errors of earlier results serve as cautionary tales that may facilitate the analysis of situations where the physics is more complicated .",
    "in this paper we present two detailed calculations of the fundamental result ( [ drhodt],[gamma ] ) .",
    "the first is a scattering theory calculation in the spirit of the usual derivations , but one that avoids a pitfall of those calculations by using localized and normalized states in the scattering calculation .",
    "the second is a weak coupling calculation that follows the spirit of master equation derivations undertaken in , _",
    "e.g. , _ quantum optics . in the first calculation",
    "we find ( [ gamma ] ) with @xmath19 . in the second we find ( [ gamma ] ) with @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath20 replaced by @xmath21 , the first born approximation to that scattering amplitude .",
    "this is precisely what would be expected , since the second calculation requires the assumption of weak interaction ; it thus serves to confirm the @xmath17 result of the first .",
    "neither of these is the most elegant or general calculation one could imagine ; the first is rather cumbersome , and the second would be neater if generalized to second quantized form @xcite .",
    "but the first has the advantage of displaying the physics of decoherence in an almost pictorial way , while allowing a calculation involving the full scattering amplitude . and the second , in its simple form , establishes a clear connection with the usual approach to decoherence through the master equation approach common in quantum optics .",
    "totally separate in their approaches , we feel that together they are a convincing demonstration that @xmath17 .",
    "these two calculations are presented in sections [ sec : scatt ] and [ sec : weak ] below . in section [ sec : dsquared ] we return to the traditional derivation and highlight its inherent shortcomings .",
    "we show how it should be modified by using a simple physical argument , which leads to a replacement rule for the occurring square of a dirac delta function .",
    "this treatment then also yields the result @xmath17 .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to set our notation we begin with a review of the standard approach used to calculate collisional decoherence .",
    "however , we also wish to point out the difficulties that can arise in its application , so we begin in a more detailed way than is normally done .    to apply scattering theory in a careful way one has to begin with an asymptotic - in state @xmath22 , a normalized ket that is the direct product of a brownian particle ket @xmath23 and a bath particle ket @xmath24 . the asymptotic - in ket is the result of the evolution of a product ket @xmath25 at @xmath26 to @xmath27 under the hamiltonian that describes the free evolution of both particles , without interaction .",
    "the effect of the two - particle scattering operator @xmath28 on this asymptotic - in state , @xmath29 , then produces the asymptotic - out state .",
    "when evolved from @xmath27 to @xmath30 by the non - interacting hamiltonian , the asymptotic - out state yields the actual state at @xmath30 that evolves from @xmath31 at @xmath26 under the influence of the full hamiltonian .     and",
    "@xmath32 at @xmath27 . in configuration ( a ) the state @xmath33 could be taken as both an asymptotic - in state and an initial state at @xmath27 ; for configuration ( b ) that would not be possible . ]    in general , of course , @xmath34 does not describe the _ actual _ ket at @xmath27 that evolves from @xmath35 at @xmath26 , because the evolution of that actual ket involves the particle interaction .",
    "but if the kets @xmath36 and @xmath32 are such that the ( short - range ) interaction between the particles has not yet had an effect ( _ e.g. , _ fig .",
    "1a but not fig .",
    "1b ) , then @xmath37 can be taken as the _ actual _ ket at @xmath27 as well as the asymptotic - in ket .",
    "we only consider kets @xmath38 and @xmath24 of this form below .",
    "we now turn to the impending collision of a bath particle characterized by @xmath32 and a brownian particle described by a reduced density operator at @xmath27 given by a convex sum of projectors @xmath39 , @xmath40 with probabilities @xmath41 , @xmath42 . here",
    "the @xmath43 label position eigenkets of the brownian particle , and @xmath44 its position representation .",
    "then @xmath45 can be considered both as the full initial ( at @xmath27 ) density operator , and the full asymptotic - in density operator .",
    "the full asymptotic - out density operator is then @xmath46 to determine terms such as @xmath47it is useful to first consider the effect of the @xmath28 operator on direct products @xmath48 of eigenkets @xmath49 of the brownian particle momentum and eigenkets @xmath50 of the bath particle momentum . since the total momentum commutes with the @xmath28 operator the scattering transformation can be reduced to a one - particle problem , with @xmath51 where the matrix element here is that of the _ _ one-__particle scattering operator @xmath52 corresponding to the two - body interaction acting in the hilbert space of the bath particle , and @xmath53 is the reduced mass . in the limit that the brownian particle is much more massive than the bath particle , @xmath54 , this reduces to @xmath55 or , moving to a position representation for the brownian particle , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the momentum operator for the bath particle , and so for general states @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 and thus @xmath61",
    "although @xmath62 is not the final density operator at @xmath63 , but only the asymptotic - out density operator , it evolves to the final density operator through the non - interacting hamiltonian , and overlaps of the form @xmath64 will be preserved during this free evolution .",
    "so the final reduced density operator for the brownian particle at @xmath30 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 as is well understood , decoherence arises because the bath particle becomes entangled with the brownian particle and the two ( asymptotic - out ) states @xmath67 and @xmath68 resulting from scattering interactions associated with the same bath ket @xmath32 and different position eigenkets @xmath69 and @xmath70 can have negligible overlap even for @xmath71 small .",
    "the change of the brownian particle s reduced density operator by a single collision is @xmath72 it involves overlap terms of the form @xmath73 where the operators @xmath74 for @xmath75 are translated scattering operators .",
    "we introduce corresponding @xmath76 operators according to @xmath77 and using the unitarity of the @xmath78 , which follows immediately because @xmath52 is unitary , we find @xmath79 and so @xmath80 where @xmath81 thus the change in the brownian particle reduced density operator is @xmath82 the general strategy is to evaluate the matrix element @xmath83 by inserting complete sets of momentum eigenstates , @xmath84 determine @xmath85 , and then perform the momentum eigenstate integrals . writing @xmath86 as well , and using the relations ( [ smatrices ] ) and ( [ tmatrices ] ) we find @xmath87 \\left\\langle \\mathbf{q}_{2}|\\mathcal{t}_{o}+\\mathcal{t}% _ { o}^{\\dagger } |\\mathbf{q}_{1}\\right\\rangle .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the @xmath52 operator matrix elements are given by @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the scattering amplitude , we can identify @xmath90 where @xmath91    now in the traditional calculations @xcite one calculates @xmath92 by considering the change @xmath93 in a time @xmath94 due to collisions with bath particles that would pass in the neighborhood of the brownian particle , taking the distribution of their velocities from the assumed thermal equilibrium of the bath . to calculate @xmath95 from one of these bath particles , a box - normalized momentum eigenstate ,",
    "@xmath96 is used in place of a localized ket @xmath97 . unlike the @xmath34 states we introduced above , the @xmath98 obviously can not be considered either as asymptotic - in states or as the actual states at @xmath27 since the @xmath96 are delocalized .",
    "nonetheless , the traditional approach seems to simplify the calculation because , as is clear from ( [ momentumdecomp ] ) , only diagonal elements @xmath99 are required if the limit of an infinite box is taken . but from the expression ( [ a21 ] ) for @xmath85",
    "it is clear that , when a resolution over a complete set of momentum states @xmath100 is inserted between @xmath101 and @xmath102 and the expression ( [ tnought ] ) for the matrix elements of @xmath102 is used , the diagonal elements @xmath103 involve the _ square _ of dirac delta functions @xmath104 . to evaluate these the `` magnitude '' of @xmath105 must be somehow set .",
    "this is done by relating it to an original normalization volume of the box . while not implausible , such a protocol is certainly not rigorous and is open to question .    to avoid the necessity of this kind of maneuver we will employ bath states @xmath32 that are normalized and _ localized",
    "_ , as is required by a strict application of scattering theory .",
    "before addressing the full calculation for a bath in thermal equilibrium we consider scattering involving a single state @xmath32 .      from the equations ( [ momentumdecomp ] ) and ( [ a21 ] ) for @xmath106 it is clear that we require integrals of the form @xmath107 which we work out in appendix [ sec : app1 ] for an arbitrary function @xmath108 of the two momentum variables .",
    "we find that we can write these expressions exactly as @xmath109 and @xmath110 the integration over @xmath111 covers all momentum space , while @xmath112 is a two dimensional momentum vector ranging over the plane perpendicular to @xmath111 ; @xmath113 is a unit vector with @xmath114 the associated solid angle element .",
    "moreover , @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 with these formulas in hand we can address the expression for @xmath118 once @xmath32 is specified . to do this",
    ", we take the bath particle wave function @xmath119 to be a gaussian wave packet centered at @xmath120 in position and @xmath121 in momentum , @xmath122 and characterized by @xmath123 with @xmath124 . for this minimum uncertainty wave packet",
    "we find that the expression for @xmath125 in the integral ( [ momentumdecomp ] ) for @xmath126 becomes @xmath127     and @xmath128 can be taken as both the total asymptotic - in density operator and the initial density operator at @xmath27 . ]",
    "we now assume that this wave packet is located far enough away from the regions of space where an initial density operator ( [ rhonought ] ) is concentrated , and with an average momentum directed towards the brownian particle such that the combined density operator ( [ rhoin ] ) can be taken both as an initial density operator at @xmath27 , and as the asymptotic - in density operator ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "then we can put @xmath138 once these approximation are made the integral over @xmath139 of the three terms in @xmath140 can be done immediately .",
    "the integral over @xmath139 of the first term is not so simple because @xmath132 still appears in @xmath141 . in the exponential we have phase factors that vary as @xmath142",
    "the first correction term is of order @xmath143 since @xmath137 this term will still be much smaller than unity even if the distance between the two positions of the brownian particle is several widths of the wave packet .",
    "we assume that @xmath144 is indeed such this quantity is much less than unity .",
    "then we can replace the phase by its leading order expansion @xmath145 in the exponentials of the first two integrals , and the integration over @xmath139 can be done as well .",
    "these are two dimensional integrals over a plane perpendicular to @xmath111 , and so they are of the form @xmath146 where we have used the fact that @xmath124 and introduced @xmath147 /a^{2}\\right ) } { \\pi a^{2 } } \\label{eq : gammadef}\\ ] ] which involves @xmath148 , the square of the component of @xmath149 that is perpendicular to @xmath150 . in all we find @xmath151 where @xmath152    this is the result we will find most useful when we move to a thermal distribution of bath particles .",
    "but we close this section with an observation that is of interest in its own right .",
    "consider the special case where the size of the bath particle wave packet is much larger than the distance between the points @xmath153 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 then in the @xmath156 functions of ( [ fguse ] ) we can replace @xmath153 and @xmath154 by @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , since the integral in ( [ efguse ] ) restricts @xmath111 to within a distance of about @xmath133 of @xmath158 , in ( [ fguse ] ) we can replace @xmath111 by @xmath158 in the scattering amplitudes and in the phase , using the assumption already made that they vary little over a range of @xmath133 ; we can also replace the @xmath156 functions by corresponding @xmath159 functions .",
    "the integral in ( [ efguse ] ) can then be done , and using ( [ deltarho ] ) we find @xmath160 the physics here is transparent since @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the impact parameter of the collision ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "decoherence occurs only if the bath particle does not `` miss '' the brownian particle , _",
    "i.e. , _ if the impact parameter @xmath162 is smaller than the wave packet extension ( as limited by the uncertainty principle ) ; its maximum effect scales with the integrated square of the amplitude of the normalized bath particle as it passes over the pair of points ( @xmath163 ) ; it vanishes as @xmath164 because the scattering by the two points then becomes identical ; and it depends only on the scattering amplitude at momentum magnitude @xmath165 because the variation of that scattering amplitude over the range of momentum components included in the wave packet has been neglected .    ; @xmath166 is the impact parameter , where @xmath167 . ]",
    "to apply the results derived above to a brownian particle subject to a thermal bath we need to describe the effect of the thermal bath in terms of incident , normalized wave packets .",
    "we start with a single bath particle restricted to a normalization volume @xmath168 . in thermal equilibrium , at temperature @xmath169 , the bath state is specified by the density operator @xmath170 provided @xmath168 is much larger than the cube of the thermal de broglie wave length @xmath171    the usual convex decomposition of ( [ rhoexpression ] ) in terms of the delocalized energy eigenstates is the obvious one and , aside from the freedom in choosing orthogonal states from among a degenerate set , it is the only one in terms of orthogonal states . but a host of others can also found . a particularly convenient set of convex decompositions for our problem at hand can be obtained by using @xmath172 which holds as long as @xmath173 and @xmath174 are both positive and @xmath175 or , in terms of the pseudo - temperatures @xmath176 and @xmath177 , @xmath178 in order to use the decomposition ( [ expansion ] ) for @xmath179 , we write @xmath180 and take the identity operator in position representation @xmath181 where the integration covers the bath volume @xmath168 .",
    "we find @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a normalized momentum distribution function , @xmath184 , and the states @xmath185 are characterized by the length scale @xmath186 ( compare with ( [ debroglie ] ) ) .",
    "one then immediately finds @xmath187 so the wave packet @xmath188 is centered at @xmath189 and has an average momentum @xmath190 .",
    "indeed , it is of the gaussian form used in the preceding section with minimal uncertainties , @xmath191 and @xmath192",

    "if we take @xmath199 then the wave packets are essentially all at rest characterized by a size @xmath200 , which is the thermal de broglie wavelength . on the other hand , for @xmath201",
    "the wave packets are much larger than the thermal de broglie wavelength , and essentially all the thermal kinetic energy is associated with the expectation value of the momenta of the wave packets ; we have @xmath202 and so a typical speed for the wave packets is @xmath203      with the preliminaries of the preceding sections we are now in a position to begin the calculation of the effect of a thermal bath on the coherence of a massive brownian particle .",
    "we begin with a number of assumptions and choices that will be made , and then discuss their applicability and relevance in the context of the calculation .      1",
    ".   we neglect initial correlations , taking the initial full density operator at @xmath27 to be a direct product of a brownian particle density operator and a density operator for the bath particles in thermal equilibrium , @xmath204 2 .",
    "we assume that the density of bath particles is much less than @xmath205 ; then the issue of particle degeneracy does not matter and we may consider the density operator of the total bath to be just the product of density operators for individual particles .",
    "thus we can calculate effects ` particle by particle ' . we choose a volume @xmath206 much larger than any other volume of interest .",
    "we use a convex decomposition of @xmath207 for a single bath particle of the type described above , with @xmath208 such that @xmath209 and therefore @xmath210 this renders @xmath133 sufficiently small so that the variation in scattering amplitudes over the momentum spread of a wave packet is negligible for essentially all of the wave packets in the convex decomposition .",
    "4 .   the value of @xmath211 should also be small enough that the neglect of the variation of the scattering amplitudes in the integral ( [ inttodo ] ) is justified , and that we can use the approximation of neglecting terms on the order of ( [ neglect ] ) above .",
    "for the latter we need @xmath212 now for typical wave packets the average momentum @xmath213 , and hence @xmath7 , will be of the order of @xmath214 , so this condition becomes @xmath215 and since @xmath216 this reduces to @xmath217 5 .",
    "we choose a coarse - graining time @xmath94 sufficiently large that @xmath218 that is , a typical packet travels a distance much greater than its width and much greater than the distance between the two decohering sites during the coarse graining time . using the expressions for @xmath219 and @xmath220 above , and @xmath216",
    ", the first condition reads @xmath221 the second condition is essentially independent of @xmath211 as long as @xmath222 , and simply demands that a typical bath particle wave packet can travel many times the distance between the decohering sites during the coarse - graining time .",
    "it is easy to see that for any @xmath153 and @xmath154 of interest we can meet all these conditions by the choice of a large enough @xmath223 , and we will see below that for a small enough density the change in the reduced density operator will be small over any given @xmath94 .",
    "hence our approximations will generally be valid in the low density limit .       and centers in the hatched region @xmath224 we take the initial density operator to be the direct product @xmath225 .",
    "for some wave packets , such as ( a ) , an actual collision will occur , while for others such as ( b ) one will not . ]",
    "the convex decomposition ( [ rhobuse ] ) we use for the density operator of a bath particle leads us to think almost classically about the collision of the wave packets @xmath226 with our brownian particle . in a naive classical picture",
    "the bath particles of a given @xmath190 that can be considered as coming in towards a collision with the brownian particle in time @xmath94 are those that lie on any of the planes perpendicular to @xmath190 and extending out a distance @xmath227 in the direction @xmath228 from @xmath157 ( recall ( [ rmdef ] ) ; see fig .",
    "4 ) . of course , some of these will completely miss the brownian particle , but none have had a collision with it in the past . for a given @xmath190",
    "we refer to this region of space as @xmath224 .    returning to the wave packets , note that those with central positions @xmath229 close to the @xmath153 or @xmath154 of interest will initially be overlapping with regions of space for which @xmath230 is non - vanishing ; here any talk of a collision is inappropriate , since at initiation , at @xmath27 , the brownian and bath particle would immediately be strongly interacting .",
    "this is an artifact of the assumption ( [ uncorrelated ] ) of an initially uncorrelated state , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "if the uncorrelated state were taken seriously , there would be a rapid `` jolt , '' or shift in the reduced density operator due to the set up of correlations @xcite .",
    "these effects we neglect here , as they are implicitly neglected in most such calculations ; we do note that , for @xmath94 large enough , the regions @xmath224 for @xmath231 of interest will be sufficiently large that only a small fraction of the wave packets in the sphere will fall in this problematic class .    in calculations involving the rest of the wave packets in @xmath232 , we can take the initial density operator also to be the asymptotic - in density operator , and use the scattering theory calculation for a bath particle wave packet given above",
    ". considering @xmath233 bath particles in volume @xmath234 , the total result for @xmath95 ( recall ( [ deltarho ] ) and ( [ rhobuse ] ) ) is then @xmath235 ) from our scattering calculation above , we have @xmath236 if in fact the strong condition ( [ strongcondition ] ) can be assumed then the integral over @xmath111 can be evaluated immediately , as was done following ( [ strongcondition ] ) , and then also the integral over @xmath190 can be performed .",
    "but this is not necessary .",
    "we can simply note that , by virtue of ( [ bcondition ] ) , @xmath194 will vary little over the range @xmath237 that @xmath238peaks and falls .",
    "hence we can replace @xmath194 by @xmath239 and @xmath240 by @xmath241 , and immediately do the integral over @xmath190 to yield @xmath242 since the only @xmath189 dependence is in the @xmath243 , see ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) , one can now do the @xmath189 integral for each fixed @xmath111 , putting @xmath244 , where @xmath245 refers to the distance in the direction @xmath246 .",
    "since the integration over @xmath247 is unrestricted in the region @xmath241 we have @xmath248 for @xmath249 @xmath250 , @xmath154 , or @xmath251 , see ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) . on the other hand there is no dependence on @xmath252 , @xmath253 and so we find @xmath254 finally , we recall that @xmath216 and therefore put @xmath255 , where @xmath256 _ cf .",

    "we showed in the preceding section how the problem of evaluating a squared dirac function can be circumvented by expressing the thermal state of the bath particles in an over - complete , non - orthogonal basis of gaussian wave packets ( see eq .",
    "( [ rhobuse ] ) ) .",
    "however , it is certainly reasonable to explore the possibility of using the standard diagonal representation of the thermal bath density operator , which facilitates the formal calculation considerably . after all , all the representations of @xmath198 are equally valid and should yield the same master equation provided the calculation is done in a correct way .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to search for a way to deal properly with such an ill - defined object as the `` square '' of a delta distribution function .    in this section",
    "we show how a proper evaluation of the diagonal momentum basis matrix elements can be implemented .",
    "this leads to an alternate derivation of the master equation ( [ drhodt],[gamma ] ) , and allows us to highlight the origin of the problem plaguing earlier workers and to discuss further implications .",
    "however , rather than attempting a mathematically rigorous formulation , we base our presentation on a simple physical argument .",
    "our point is that such an argument can lead to a prescription for correctly evaluating improper products of dirac delta functions , although this differs from previous naive treatments .",
    "let us consider again the action of a _ single _ scattering event on the brownian particle in position representation @xmath263 and in the limit of a large mass .",
    "it follows from the discussion in section [ sec : scatt ] that after the collision it differs merely by a factor from the initial brownian state , @xmath264 which is given by @xmath265 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhochange ] ) and ( [ eq : overlap ] ) ) . in section [ sec : scatt ] only pure states @xmath266 of the bath particle were considered , but the reasoning is immediately generalized to mixed states .    the factor @xmath267 may be called the decoherence function , since it describes the effective loss of coherence in the brownian state which arises from disregarding the scattered bath particle .",
    "the normalization of @xmath198 implies @xmath268 which means that the collision does not change the position distribution of the brownian point particle , @xmath269 . on the other hand ,",
    "possible quantum correlations between increasingly far separated points will vanish , since a collision may be viewed as a position measurement of the brownian particle by the bath which destroys superpositions of distant locations : @xmath270 this complete loss of coherence implies that the collision took place with a probability of one .",
    "it could be realized , in particular , by taking the incoming bath particle state to be a momentum eigenket in a box centered on one of the scattering sites .    in thermal equilibrium",

    ".    the expression in square brackets in ( [ eq : eta2 ] ) should be well - defined and finite .",
    "however , it involves two arbitrarily large quantities , the `` quantization volume '' @xmath168 , which stems from the normalization of the bath particle , and the squared amplitude of the @xmath102-operator with respect to ( improper ) momentum kets . the simple matrix element is given by the expression ( [ tnought ] ) @xmath285 involving the scattering amplitude and a delta - function which ensures the conservation of energy during an elastic collision .",
    "the squared modulus of ( [ eq : tme ] ) is not well defined in the sense of distributions , but depends on the specific limiting process from which the dirac delta function originates .",
    "yet one would naturally expect that an appropriate replacement has the form @xmath286 with @xmath287 a function involving the quantization volume .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : eta2 ] ) displays the correct limiting behavior ( [ eq : lim1 ] ) since the expression in round brackets vanishes as @xmath288 . on the other hand , for large separations of the points the phase in ( [ eq : eta2 ] ) oscillates rapidly and it will not contribute to the integral in the limit @xmath289 . therefore the limit ( [ eq : lim2 ] ) allows to specify the unknown function @xmath287 in ( [ eq : tme2 ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath290 with @xmath291 the total cross section for scattering at momentum @xmath190 .",
    "formally , this means that one should treat the expression involving the squared @xmath292-function and scattering amplitude as @xmath293      a master equation can now be derived in the same spirit as above . in the low density limit for the bath particles ,",
    "the decohering effect of each collision can be treated independently and the overall decoherence in a short time interval @xmath94 is determined only by the mean number and type of single collisions .    for bath particles with momentum @xmath190 the mean number of collisions",

    "it is clear that the derivation of the decoherence function ( [ eq : etadef ] ) does not hold rigorously even for volume - normalized ( [ eq : ptildedef ] ) momentum states , since their amplitude is uniform in space and they can not be considered as asymptotic - in or asymptotic - out states .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that one obtains the `` correct '' master equation by using the diagonal momentum representation ( [ eq : rhob ] ) indicates that it can be reasonable , at least in a formal sense , to extend the applicability of ( [ eq : etadef ] ) to volume - normalized momentum eigenstates .",
    "then the appearance of the total cross section in the appropriate replacement rule ( [ eq : deltasquare ] ) has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the squared matrix element of the @xmath102 operator with respect to two orthogonal proper states may be viewed as the probability for a transition between the states due to a collision .",
    "the appropriate normalization of the probability necessary in the limit of improper states is then effected by the appearance of the total cross section @xmath300 in ( [ eq : deltasquare ] ) , which is absent in the usual naive treatments of the squared delta function .",

    "there the @xmath305 are the transmission amplitudes between the incoming and outgoing states and the current conservation implies @xmath306 in analogy to ( [ eq : boxsum ] ) .    the fact that the conservation relation ( [ eq : boxsum ] ) has no meaningful equivalence in the continuum limit @xmath307",
    "is closely connected to the difficulty of evaluating the squared scattering amplitude in the momentum representation .",
    "it suggests that the diagonal representation of @xmath198 can be used in a rigorous formulation of the master equation only if the transition of going from a discrete to a continuous set of bath states is delayed until after the square of the scattering matrix element is evaluated . a calculation along this line , albeit in a perturbative framework , is presented in the following section .",
    "we now consider an approach that is totally different from the derivation in section  [ sec : scatt ] . instead of performing a scattering calculation",
    ", we obtain a master equation for the reduced density operator from a weak coupling approximation that is very similar to the analyses of quantum optics . again the assumption of a low density of bath particles will allow us to calculate the effect of the bath particles one particle at a time , so we begin with our brownian particle and a single bath particle restricted to a box of normalization volume @xmath206 .",
    "while we will take the limit @xmath308 in the course of the calculation , we can do it in such a way that products of dirac delta functions never appear .    in the absence of any interaction between the particles",

    "this equation is exact .",
    "the first term on the right side describes a unitary modification to the dynamics of the density operator due to the interaction with the bath particles ; we neglect it here since it will not lead to decoherence . for the other terms we make the standard weak - coupling approximations @xcite : we replace @xmath328 by @xmath330 assume an initially uncorrelated density operator , @xmath331 , ( _ cf . _ equation ( [ uncorrelated ] ) ) , and at time @xmath94 trace over the bath to find the change in the reduced density operator for the brownian particle as @xmath332 to construct @xmath333 we begin with a fourier expansion of the interaction potential , writing @xmath334 choosing the prefactor for later convenience . then forming ( [ hit ] ) , by inserting resolutions of unity ( [ eq : discres ] ) in terms of the energy eigenstates between the free evolution terms and the potential ,",
    "we find @xmath335 although this approach leads easily to considering the more general problem of a finite mass brownian particle , we defer that to a later communication . here",
    "we take the infinite mass limit for the brownian particle by taking @xmath336 in ( [ hiresult ] ) , and we can then write @xmath337 where @xmath338 and @xmath339 using these in the expression ( [ deltarhotest ] ) for @xmath340 , we find @xmath341 with @xmath342 here we no longer distinguish between the schrdinger and the interaction picture of the reduced density operator since they yield the same evolution in the infinite mass limit .",
    "the response function @xmath343 involves the correlator @xmath344 where @xmath345 is the probability associated with state @xmath346 . at this point",
    "we include the fact that @xmath233 particles exist in volume @xmath206 by multiplying the one particle probability by @xmath233 . moreover , for a large volume @xmath168 we can replace the summation over the bath momenta by an integral , @xmath347 where @xmath5 is the bath particle density and @xmath348 the thermal distribution function ( [ eq : mu ] ) .",

    "we then obtain a master equation for the reduced density operator of the brownian particle , @xmath364 although not explicitly in lindblad form this equation yields a completely positive evolution of @xmath365 and can be put in lindblad form , since @xmath366 .    to see the physics of this result and to compare it with earlier work we go into the coordinate representation , @xmath367 ,",

    "in this article we presented two detailed derivations of the quantum master equation for a massive brownian particle subject to collisions with particles from a thermalized environment , and a third argument for the master equation based on physical motivations . they represent rather different strategies of dealing with the principal problem that arises in the formulation of collisional decoherence : the momentum eigenstates that are the most natural for describing the density operator of the thermal bath do not constitute proper states for the application of scattering theory .    by representing the thermal bath with an appropriate over - complete basis , we obtained in section [ sec : scatt ] the full master equation in a calculation that is mathematically and physically convincing , but cumbersome .",
    "the perturbative treatment in section  [ sec : weak ] permitted the avoidance of improper states up to a point where they could be handled in an unambiguous way .",
    "yet this calculation hides some of the physics involved , and does not in itself suggest an immediate generalization to higher orders in the perturbation parameter .",
    "more straightforward , but also most ventured , is the use of the replacement rule put forward in section  [ sec : dsquared ] .",
    "it yields the master equation immediately , but lacks the mathematical foundation one would wish for an equation describing a process as fundamental as decoherence by collisions .",
