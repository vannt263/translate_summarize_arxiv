    "almost all known superconductors are conventional electron - phonon superconductors , and the phenomenon of unconventional superconductivity , especially in one - dimensional ( 1d ) materials , is relatively unexplored .",

    "is of significant importance @xcite .",

    "the superconductivity in k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 exhibits various features that are suggestive of an unconventional nature .",
    "the superconducting state arises out of a normal state that has a large specific heat coefficient of 7075 mj k@xmath16 mol@xmath17 , which indicates strong quasiparticle mass renormalization@xcite .",
    "the upper critical field exceeds the one - band bcs estimate of the pauli limit by a factor of 34@xcite .",
    "nmr experiments show that spin fluctuations grow as the temperature approaches @xmath6 @xcite . below @xmath6 ,",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate does not show hebel - slichter coherence peak that is characteristic of an isotropic @xmath18-wave superconductor , and the relaxation rate decreases with a power - law behavior suggesting the presence of zero - energy excitations in the superconducting state .",
    "the presence of zero - energy excitations is also seen in the temperature dependence of the penetration depth , which decreases linearly at temperatures well below @xmath6@xcite .",

    "this suggest that the pairing is of @xmath18-wave type since scattering with non - magnetic impurities tends to average out the superconducting gap function , which would be detrimental to unconventional superconductors as their gap function has different signs in different regions of the brillouin zone .    motivated by these observations ,",

    "the one - dimensional nature of the material is evident from the relatively small dispersion along the in - plane @xmath40@xmath41@xmath7@xmath40 and @xmath12@xmath42@xmath43@xmath12 paths .",
    "however , some bands do show moderate dispersion along these paths , which indicates that the bonding between [ ( cr@xmath1as@xmath1)@xmath13@xmath14 chains is substantial .",
    "the bands disperse strongly in the @xmath44 direction ( the @xmath40-@xmath12 path ) , and these reflect the short inter - atomic distances and strong bonding in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "i find substantial as @xmath19 character above the fermi level and the presence of large amount cr @xmath20 character in the lower part of the valence band manifold , which suggests that there is a strong covalency between cr and as atoms .",
    "even though the valence bands disperse relatively little in the in - plane directions , the valence band manifold extends from @xmath45 to @xmath46 ev and has a band width of 5.0 ev .",
    "this again reflects the strong covalency between cr and as atoms .",
    "i obtain @xmath47 ev@xmath17 per formula unit both spin basis for a value of the electronic density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this corresponds to a calculated sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath48 mj / mol k@xmath49 .",
    "the experimental @xmath50 obtained from specific heat capacity measurements is @xmath5170 mj / mol k@xmath49@xcite , and this corresponds to an ehancement by a factor of 4.3 relative to the calculated value .",
    "there are three bands that cross the fermi level , and these give rise to three fermi sheets .",
    "the two upper - lying bands cross the fermi level only along the @xmath44 direction and give rise to a pair of 1d sheets . in my calculations",

    "the lower - lying band crosses the fermi level around the @xmath41 point , and this gives rise to a large three - dimensional sheet .",
    "therefore , even though the structure of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 is quasi-1d , the material is very three - dimensional from the electronic structure point of view .",

    "[ fig : pband ] and [ fig : pdos ] , respectively .",
    "these again reflect the quasi-1d nature of the material as the in - plane dispersion of the optical branches is comparatively smaller than the out - of - plane dispersion .",
    "the strong bonding along the @xmath15 axis is also seen in the large dispersion of the out - of - plane polarized acoustic mode along the @xmath52 direction .",
    "this branch reaches more than 100 @xmath2 .",
    "although the acoustic branches have smaller dispersion along the in - plane direction , these do not exhibit soft - mode behavior .",
    "this indicates weaker bonding between the [ ( cr@xmath1as@xmath1)@xmath13@xmath14 chains , but it also implies that the structure is stable and not in a very close vicinity of a structural phase transition .",
    "the pdos exhibits many narrow peaks that are caused by narrow band widths of the phonon branches .",
    "the partial pdos shows that the k atoms contribute to phonon modes up to 200 @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the k atoms do not behave like a rattler that is weakly coupled to the lattice .",
    "the interaction with k ions is also seen in the stronger dispersion around the @xmath41 point for branches below 200 @xmath2 . the cr and as atoms contribute to vibrations all across the phonon dispersion range . in particular , both cr and as atoms contribute to the high - frequency phonon modes that again indicates strong covalency between these two .",
    "the strength of the interaction between electrons and phonons is described in terms of the eliashberg spectral function : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electronic density of states at the fermi level , @xmath55 is the electronic energy at wavevector @xmath56 and band index @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the energy of a phonon with wavevector @xmath3 and branch index @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the matrix element for an electron in the state @xmath61 scattering to @xmath62 through a phonon @xmath63 .",
    "the calculated eliashberg function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eliash ] .",
    "it shows that phonon at all frequencies contribute to the coupling , although the the phonon modes around 50 @xmath2 make an especially large contribution .",
    "the pdos also shows a peak at this frequency .",
    "similar low - energy peaks has also been observed in @xmath9mo@xmath64 compounds , and they have been attributed to the einstein - like vibrations of @xmath7 atoms@xcite .",

    "[ fig : pdos ] that the motion of all three types of atoms contribute to this low - energy peak in k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 . therefore ,",
    "even if these phonons have relatively small dispersion , the coupling can not be ascribed to an einstein - type rattling vibration of k atoms .",
    "i also investigated the polarization of the phonons that show large coupling to the electrons and find that these show strong in - plane character .",

    "fig : lambdaq ] .",
    "i find that the variance of the coupling is large within a @xmath52 plane .",
    "furthermore , the coupling strongly decreases as one moves away from the brillouin zone center along the @xmath52 direction .",
    "this shows that the coupling is highly anisotropic , and it should also result in an anisotropic superconducting gap function . to find out which fermi sheets contribute more to the total electron - phonon coupling , i calculated the partial electron - phonon couplings at several @xmath3 points by summing over the 1d and 3d fermi sheets separately in eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha ] .",
    "i find that the 3d sheet makes a dominant contribution to the coupling .",
    "therefore , controlling the size of the 3d sheet by chemical doping , pressure or strain might be an effective way of enhancing or suppressing superconductivity .",

    "the simplified allen - dynes formula has the form @xmath71 using a value of @xmath72 for the coulomb pseudopotential parameter , i obtain @xmath73 k , which strongly overestimates the experimental @xmath6 of 6 k. a full solution of the migdal - eliashberg equations , which is beyond the scope of this paper , will be required to obtain a more accurate @xmath6 based on the calculated spectral function .",
    "furthermore , there might be additional reasons for the overestimation of @xmath6 . in the phonon calculations ,",
    "i have neglected the phonon anharmonicities .",

    "first principles calculations show the presence of various magnetic interactions with in this material@xcite , and this will also suppress @xmath6 .",
    "the calculated total electron - phonon coupling @xmath74 readily explains the experimentally observed large electron mass enhancement from specific heat measurments .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling enhances the mass by a factor of @xmath75 , which is very close to the experimentally observed mass enhancement factor of 4.3 .",
    "therefore , the large mass enhancement in this material does not come from strong electronic correlations ( in the sense of electron - electron interactions ) or spin fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with the experimentally estimated wilson ration of @xmath76@xcite that suggests a weak magnetic enhancement .",
    "the strong coupling nature of superconductivity in k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 is also evident in the large jump of the dimensionless specific heat @xmath77@xcite at @xmath6 .",
    "the strong electron - phonon coupling superconductivity proposed here can further be confirmed from tunneling experiments that should show a large value for the ratio @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the superconducting gap .",
    "although the calculations presented here imply that the superconductivity in k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 is caused by electron - phonon interactions , this does not necessarily mean that the superconductivity is dull or of the conventional bcs type .",
    "the crystal structure of this material lacks inversion symmetry , and parity is not a good quantum number is such a case .",
    "the pairing will likely have a dominant @xmath18 character mixed with some @xmath19 character .",
    "this can explain the presence of weak internal magnetic field below @xmath6 in @xmath22sr measurements@xcite .",
    "in addition , the electron - phonon coupling is highly anisotropic , which can lead to accidental gaps in the superconducting state .",
    "this would be consistent with the signatures of nodes in the gap function in the nmr@xcite and penetration depth@xcite measurements as well as the absence of hebel - slichter peak in the nmr measurements .",
    "the presence of such a large electron - phonon coupling in this material provides an opportunity to study the properties of a superconducting state in the strong coupling limit .",
    "in particular , this may help explain why the measured upper critical fields @xmath28 and @xmath27 greatly exceeds the pauli limit estimated for a weakly - coupled isotropic bcs superconductor . it would be interesting to see if the fact that the coupling strongly decreases away from the @xmath4 plane can explain why @xmath80 in this material .",
    "these issues require more theoretical studies based on the full solution of migdal - eliashberg equations to be fully clarified .",
    "as mentioned above , superconductivity is also observed in other inorganic quasi-1d compounds including tl@xmath0mo@xmath10se@xmath10 and li@xmath81mo@xmath10o@xmath82 , and the nature of their pairing interaction has not been fully elucidated .",
    "the results of phonon dispersions and electron - phonon coupling for k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 presented here provides a reference case for other quasi-1d superconductors .",
    "in particular , the present study shows that a behavior that deviates from what is expected from a weakly - coupled isotropic @xmath18-wave bcs superconductor does not necessarily imply that the superconductivity is mediated by magnetic interactions .",
    "in summary , i have investigated the lattice dynamics and electron - phonon coupling in k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 using first principles calculations .",
    "the phonon dispersions do not show closeness to a lattice instability and exhibits features pointing to a strong coupling of k atoms with the lattice .",
    "the eliashberg spectral function is strongly enhance around 50 @xmath2 , but there is coupling to high frequency phonons as well .",
    "the peak in the spectral function corresponds to the vibrations of all three constituent atomic species of the material .",
    "although the electrons do not predominantly couple to vibrations of any specific atoms , vibrations that involve in - plane motion of atoms show strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling shows strong @xmath3 dependence , especially along the out - of - plane direction .",
    "the calculated total - electron phonon coupling @xmath83 = 3.0 is large and is consistent with the experimentally observed large mass enhancement and jump in the specific heat at @xmath6@xcite .",
    "these calculations motivate tunneling experiments that can further confirm the strong coupling nature of superconductivity in this material by displaying an enhanced value of the ratio @xmath84 .",
