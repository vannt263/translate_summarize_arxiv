    "strong coupling between the light field and a single atom is a cornerstone of quantum optics .",
    "it has been achieved in a large number of laboratories around the world in the last decades @xcite .",
    "the interface of choice is usually a high - finesse cavity : as well known , the mode density and field amplitude is increased when the cavity volume is decreased . recently ,",
    "some groups have started considering a simpler interface : _",
    "lenses_. focusing is in fact the natural way of concentrating light at a desired position , here that of the atom .",
    "this choice is partly motivated by the perspectives in quantum information science .",
    "complex information processing tasks will eventually require to scale up from the single quantum system to that of a network of systems . at each node , information could be processed on atoms or ions , whose states can be carefully manipulated and efficiently detected ; to transmit information between the nodes , one would rather encode it in states of light .",
    "a crucial ingredient of such a network is the coherent operation of a matter - photon interface at the single - photon level @xcite . as a first step towards this futuristic vision",
    ", strong coupling between atoms and _ propagating _ light should be demonstrated .",
    "experiments conducted on single molecules @xcite and single atoms @xcite have shown promising results .",
    "a theoretical analysis of such a focusing configuration was done previously in @xcite , and rectified in @xcite . however , in this latter paper , a significant discrepancy was reported between some experimentally measured data and the corresponding theoretical prediction . as usual , the theoretical model does not match the complexity of reality in many aspects . here , we show that the discrepancy can be essentially accounted for if one includes the fact that the atom is at finite temperature and therefore is not sitting exactly at the position of the focus , but is rather wobbling around it .",
    "while this effect is pretty obvious , its description is not : one must be able to compute the electric field felt by the atom at any point close to the focus of the system . due to the strong",
    "focusing , the paraxial approximation is not valid , so the well known closed form solutions for the electric field can not be used .    in section [ sec : formalism ] we develop the necessary formalism .",
    "we start by defining the propagation problem and solving it to find an integral equation for the electric field ( [ sec : e_field ] ) .",
    "this can later be solved numerically to obtain the field anywhere in the system .",
    "further , we model the atomic response ( [ ss : atomresp ] ) and the detection process ( [ sec : detector ] ) , with a special attention to the measurement of _ extinction _ that was reported in @xcite . in section [ sec : temp ] , we apply our formalism to quantify the effects of temperature .",
    "we show that we can fit the experimental data by assuming a temperature @xmath0 and discuss the meaning of this value .",
    "the electric field after it passes through the single mode fiber has , to a good approximation , the gaussian shape @xmath1 where we have used cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the polarization of the field , @xmath4 is the amplitude , and @xmath5 represents the width of the beam .",
    "we model the lens as the infinite plane @xmath6 . the impinging electric field at @xmath7",
    "is transformed according to @xmath8 the transformation matrix @xmath9 has the following form : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 notice that the factor of @xmath13 is required by energy flux conservation ( cf .",
    "for instance pg 391 of @xcite ) .",
    "now , it remains to propagate the electric field in the confocal region .",
    "we do so with a green s function approach : the electric field is a solution to the following equation , @xmath14 solving for the dyadic green s function defined as @xmath15 we arrive at @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the plane where we know fully the electric field , @xmath18 , and we have used the long wavelength approximation @xmath19 .",
    "details of the derivation can be found in appendix [ sec : appelec ] .",
    "although the integrand in this equation is highly oscillatory , we do not make a stationary phase approximation as it gives a form similar to the paraxial approximation , and this has been shown to give incorrect results @xcite .",
    "we evaluate this integral numerically with usual gaussian quadrature @xcite and the method of numerical steepest descent @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 atom , modeled as a two - level system , is excited by a weak classical probe beam driving it at the resonant frequency @xmath21 .",
    "the weak beam assumption allows us both to ignore incoherent scattering by the atom , and to write a fixed phase relation between the dipole and laser electric fields .",
    "the assumption of resonance just means that , with respect to the phase of the field at the location of the atom , @xmath22 , the electric field produced by the atom should have a @xmath23 phase lag .    combining these with the usual dipole electric field , we arrive at , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electric field of the atom and laser respectively",
    ", @xmath27 represents the phase lag of the dipole and @xmath3 is assumed to be the polarization of the laser field before the lens , and the dipole .      in the experiments @xcite , the measured field",
    "is collected by a collection lens , coupled into a single - mode fiber , and is subsequently sent to a photon counting detector .",
    "therefore , only the overlap between the collected electric field and the mode of the fiber will be ultimately detected .",
    "the calibration showed that essentially all the input light is detected at the output in the absence of an atom . in view of this , we assume that the mode of the fiber , @xmath28 , is proportional to the initial electric field at the @xmath7 plane , i.e. @xmath29 the intensity recorded by the detector becomes @xmath30 in the rest of this article , we will be concerned with the extinction , @xmath31 , of the input field due to the presence of the atom defined as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the recorded intensity with no atom present in the setup , and @xmath34 is when a single atom is present .",
    "in the experiment , the atom is held in an approximately harmonic trap at a particular temperature .",
    "thus , the two following major effects can be expected : doppler shifts of the incoming laser field , and polarization mismatch due to strong focusing by the lenses .      to a good approximation ,",
    "the potential of the atom in the dipole trap is harmonic and can be written , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the trapping frequencies in the radial and longitudinal direction respectively .",
    "we approximate the state of the atom as a thermal state @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the eigenstate of the harmonic oscillator in the z direction with eigenvalue @xmath41 ; while @xmath42 is the projector on the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue of @xmath43 , so @xmath44 .    since the electric field is propagating in the @xmath45 direction , we need only calculate the rms velocity in this direction .",
    "the square of the momentum is , @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the doppler shift to lowest order is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the wavenumber , and @xmath50 is the velocity . using an estimate of @xmath51 for the temperature , we obtain a value of @xmath52 . this doppler detuning is about 0.02 times the 30 mhz linewidth of the transition .",
    "this justifies us ignoring the doppler shift and considering only the spatial averaging .",
    "before we continue the averaging over the atomic spatial profile , it is worthwhile to reconsider in detail how the experiment is done .",
    "we know that the atom is initially loaded into the dipole trap from a mot , and mot clouds are typically about @xmath53 , which in our case is about @xmath54 .",
    "this typical temperature is justification enough to use a fully quantum model to describe the experiment .",
    "however , rough estimates of the heating due to finite data collection time put the temperature in the @xmath51 range , in which the simpler classical treatment is justified . therefore , for any function @xmath55 which depends on the position and momentum coordinates of the atom , the average value will be given by @xmath56 where we have used the a classical canonical ensemble to describe the system and @xmath57 is the classical hamiltonian describing the system .",
    "the extinction defined in can be reduced to , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath26 are the electric fields of the atom and laser respectively , on the plane of detection . since the propagation of the field is unitary , and we assume infinite detectors , we can move the collection plane to that of the second lens in the confocal arrangement , @xmath60 .",
    "this means that , @xmath61 is the extinction of the probe beam in the atom were at @xmath62 , where we have taken the atom to be in the x - z plane , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are shown in appendix [ sec : app_ext ] .",
    "notice that due to cylindrical symmetry of the system , it is enough to consider the atom at @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the measured extinction must be the averaged extinction , weighted in the canonical ensemble as in .",
    "so we have to compute , @xmath65 we first plot extinction vs temperature for a particular value of the focusing parameter , @xmath66 , where @xmath5 represents the width of the initial gaussian beam , and @xmath67 is the focal length of the lens used .    , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as used in the experiments .",
    "the dotted lines are the effects of the experimental uncertainties in the trap parameters .",
    "this gives a prediction of the temperature of the atom to be about 185 @xmath70 @xmath54 . ]    now , following reference @xcite , we plot curves of extinction vs focusing strength , including the effects of a finite temperature of the atom , for 10 , 50 and @xmath71 .    ) , as well as the experimental points ( filled circles ) , are the same as in @xcite .",
    "the other curves are plotted for for @xmath7210 , 50 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the dotted lines come from the experimental uncertainty in the trapping frequencies . ]",
    "figure [ fig : ex vs u zoomed ] shows that the experimental point seem to follow the correct trend if we just include a higher temperature .",
    "this shows that the temperature must be the main cause of the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "now we plot for a wider range of focusing strengths to show the expected trend for a larger focusing .    ,",
    "but for a larger range of focusing parameters .",
    "]      the previous section shows that , from the simulations , we should be expecting temperatures of around @xmath73 , which is higher than the doppler cooling limit for @xmath20 .",
    "this requires further investigation , since we are expecting cooler atoms .",
    "we now estimate the initial temperature of the trap to evaluate the quality of the trap .    a simple estimation for the scattering rate would be to compare the difference in the number of counts with and without an atom in the focus .",
    "this simple estimation gives approximately 2500@xmath74 as the scattering rate . using a data collection time of 140ms , and recoil frequency of about 3.8khz gives the energy increase as , @xmath75 where the factor of 2 in the energy comes from considerations of both the absorption and emission processes .",
    "since the atom is in a harmonic potential , with a thermal density of the form , we require , @xmath76 the above equation can be solved numerically to give a temperature increase of , @xmath77 . the temperature obtained from figure [ fig : ex vs t ]",
    "is the averaged temperature over the probe time .",
    "thus , assuming a linear increase of temperature , this gives an estimate of the initial temperature to be @xmath78 .",
    "although this temperature is above the doppler cooling limit for @xmath20 , it should be noted that the atom is loaded from a magneto - optical trap into the dipole trap , which is @xmath79 deep . during the loading of the atom into the trap , it is unavoidable that the atom heats up .",
    "since this trap depth is an order of magnitude larger than the doppler cooling limit , the predicted initial temperature is well within the expected temperature range .",
    "we are thus confident that finite temperature effects of the atom accounts for the discrepancy reported in @xcite .",
    "however , these predictions still have to be verified by a suitable temperature measurement , one possibility being that described in @xcite , due to it s high similarity with the setup used .",
    "another possibility would be to perform raman sideband cooling , and inferring the temperature from there .",
    "the latter would seem the better choice , since the atom would be cooled in the process .",
    "in this work , we present a further step in the characterization of the results of @xcite . we show that the inclusion of finite atomic temperature although intuitively simple , is not straightforward to implement , and numerical simulations seem like the only feasible option .",
    "after we include this in the description of this trap , we compare theoretical predictions and experimental data , and show that the difference in the data can be attributed to the atomic temperature .",
    "after numerical studies , we obtain an effective atomic temperature of about @xmath78 before probing of the atom .",
    "although this temperature seems high , the discussion of section [ sec : meaning ] gives us some insight as to the problem , and we are probably not even justified to make a comparison with the recoil or doppler temperatures as found in the literature , due to a slightly differing definition of temperature used .",
    "thus , we are unable to draw a definite temperature for the atom just from this study , and more work to measure and perhaps to cool the temperature is required .",
    "we would like to thank wang yimin , syed abdullah aljunid , gleb maslennikov , lee jianwei and christian kurtsiefer for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the national research foundation and the ministry of education , singapore .",
    "we set out here to give a more formal derivation for the green s function used in equation .",
    "this approach follows closely @xcite . + for completeness , we repeat the following definitions .",
    "the electric field at any point is a solution of , @xmath80 this equation can be solved with the help of the dyadic green s function defined as , @xmath81 taking the divergence of , and substituting the resultant equation back , we obtain , @xmath82 this shows that if we have a green s function which satisfies the scalar helmholtz equation , ie . @xmath83",
    "the green s function as defined in can be constructed as , @xmath84 we use the green s function representing outgoing spherical waves , @xmath85 where @xmath86 . to use the green s function , we approach in a similar fashion to diffraction theory and consider the following difference , @xmath87 \\cdot { \\overleftrightarrow}{g } ,   \\label{vecform}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 denotes differentiation with respect to the prime coordinates , and in the second term",
    ", we do not differentiate @xmath90 .",
    "notice that we have preserved the order of the multipliction .",
    "then , using green s second vector identity , this becomes , @xmath91,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the levi - civita tensor , and we assume the einstein summation convention .",
    "however , using equations and , equation is nothing but , @xmath93 .",
    "we thus have , @xmath94 .",
    "\\label{eqn : b4 int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we only know the electric field on a plane , we need that the dyadic green s function be longitudinal on the plane , ie .",
