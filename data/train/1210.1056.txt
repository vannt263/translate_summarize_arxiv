    "as the research on the interaction of light with metallic structures matures as a well - established technology called plasmonics  @xcite , the coupling of surface plasmons to different light sources are being investigated , with the motivation that controlling surface plasmons offer the potential for developing different types of sp - integrated nanophotonic devices  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the coupling between sps and confined light modes are widely investigated .",
    "a recent proposal is based on the resonant interaction between the sps on a metal surface and co - propagating soliton in a nonlinear dielectric medium  @xcite . under a classical formulation ,",
    "this system exhibits rich nonlinear dynamical features where the interaction depends on the soliton amplitude , as such it may be utilized to manipulate the sp propagation . as an additional feature , it has been shown  @xcite that the system is akin to the bosonic josephson - junction of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite so that similar and different nonlinear josephson junction features may be realized in this optic - plasmonic system . + while this was an exciting analogy , surface plasmons are subject to strong dissipative effects in the host metal and perfect josephson junction is a too idealized model . in the present work",
    ", we aim to make a more faithful representation of the system by taking into account the dissipation .",
    "remarkably , we find that the dissipation can bring some benefits if it could be introduced under control .",
    "the junction can exhibit stable dynamics in spite of dissipation .",
    "based on this motivation , we investigate here the dissipation effects of the coupled soliton - sp system based on the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and then formulated as a nonlinear josephson junction  @xcite .",
    "we note that dissipation effects in the bosonic josephson junction ( bjj ) were previously studied ,  @xcite which might be useful to refer for comparison .",
    "we employ a standard dynamical analysis of the system in the phase space representation , and investigate how different dissipation mechanisms and other model parameters affect the phase - space landscape .",
    "bifurcations in the system are highlighted which may be induced in certain regimes of these parameters .",
    "construction of a classical theoretical model for a coupled soliton surface - plasmon system has been addressed recently in a number of publications .",
    "an elegant initiative was the heuristic model introduced by bliokh and collaborators ,  @xcite in which the interaction between the soliton and the surface - plasmon is formulated as a coupled non - linear / linear oscillator system , with the coupling parameter being dependent on the soliton amplitude . while being constrained by a number of simplifying assumptions , the model predicts stationary coupled modes of the soliton and the surface - plasmons under feasible parameter regimes . in a following work , stationary and quasi - stationary solutions for the so - called soliplasmons are investigated under an asymmetric coupling model  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will employ the heuristic coupled - oscillator model , albeit with an improved coupling parameter adapted from the recent formulations .",
    "our main motivation is to incorporate the correct behavior for the coupling in the strong soliton and strong surface - plasmon amplitudes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we begin by recapitulating the heuristic theoretical model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the interaction between optical solitons and surface plasmons ( sp ) is discussed in the context of an resonant optical system : a soliton propagating parallel to a metal interface can excite surface - plasmons by its evanescent lateral tail , which , in turn , interacts in resonance with the soliton along the propagation .",
    "the soliton and the sp are assumed to be co - propagating , hence only the spatial dynamics of the propagation is of concern .",
    "the nonlinearity of the system is assumed to be confined at a distance , @xmath1 , from the metal interface such that the surface - plasmon propagation retains linearity , and the coupling between the soliton and sp - fields is weak .",
    "the formulation is based on a 2d coordinate system in which @xmath2 is the propagation direction and @xmath3 is the lateral direction .",
    "the total electric field of the system is introduced by the following variational ansatz in which the soliton and sp fields are written in a product form of their respective longitudinal ( @xmath4 ) and transverse amplitudes .",
    "@xmath5 } , \\label{eq : total field}\\ ] ]    evanescent wavevectors are @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the @xmath8 is the incoming wave vector whereas @xmath9 is the sp wave vector .",
    "@xmath10 is the nonlinearity parameter of the dielectric strip . the longitudinal amplitudes @xmath4 obey the coupled spatial propagation wave equations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the dimensionless propagation coordinate .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the propagation constants of sp and soliton respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the coupling function which we will discuss further below .",
    "the coupled equations are linearized by introducing @xmath17 into eq .",
    "[ eq : coupledoscillator ] and by employing the slowly varying amplitude approximation to discard higher order derivatives . the final set of equations are then : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the small deviations of the dimensionless propagation constants of surface - plasmon and soliton , respectively",
    ".    evidently , the coupling function plays the main role in these equations .",
    "qualitatively , it should describe the interaction through the overlap of the evanescent tails of the soliton and plasmon in the ( linear ) dielectric spacer between the metal interface and the nonlinear dielectric waveguide .",
    "since the lateral profile of a soliton depends on its amplitude , the coupling function is expected to exhibit this dependence , too .",
    "an analytical formulation of the coupling function was provided in ref .",
    "@xcite with the remark that the equation system is not symmetric in the coupling function in general . within the heuristic model",
    ", the following functional form captures the expected behavior in the strong soliton and strong sp amplitude limits :    @xmath22    here , @xmath23 is an overall constant which we introduce as a parameter to account for the other constants ( e.g. permittivities , propagation constants ) .",
    "the key parameters are preserved in the functional form . in the strong soliton amplitudes ( @xmath24 ) ,",
    "the exponentially decaying term dominates the coupling . in the weak soliton amplitude ,",
    "the coupling is proportional to @xmath25 since the soliton lateral profile in eq .",
    "[ eq : total field ] would be wider resulting in a larger overlap .",
    "the analogy between this model and the bosonic josephson junction ( bjj ) dynamics  @xcite is revealed when we further substitute @xmath26 into eq .",
    "[ eq : cp_and_cs ] and introduce a new variable set consisting of the fractional population imbalance @xmath27 and the relative phase difference between the soliton and the sp @xmath28 : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , is the nonlinearity parameter , and @xmath32 parametrizes the asymmetry between the soliton and sp states ( similar to the asymmetry between the wells of a double well system ) .",
    "@xmath33 is constant for the isolated system .",
    "the coupling function @xmath34 takes the form @xmath35 we stress that the @xmath36 dependence makes an inherently dynamic coupling as opposed to constant ( or externally tunable ) coupling parameter present in bjj - systems . with this formulation , the coupled soliton sp system can be described as a nonlinear josephson junction .",
    "the range of the model parameters are chosen to be around the resonant coupling regime  @xcite . in the calculations presented below",
    ", we fix the dimensionless separation parameter @xmath37 , and choose the other parameters between @xmath38 , @xmath39 - 0.4@xmath400.4@xmath41 , accordingly .",
    "evidently , using larger @xmath42 values would confine the interaction to smaller soliton amplitudes and eventually result in the decoupling of the soliton and the sp completely .",
    "small @xmath42 values would not be applicable in the weak coupling approximation .",
    "owing to the analogy to the bjj models  @xcite , the first dissipation mechanism we consider is about the incoherent exchange of photons between the soliton and the sp .",
    "this is introduced by the term @xmath43 in the following equations ,    @xmath44    @xmath45    under coordinate reversal @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 , hence , the dissipative term @xmath43 appearing in the equation for @xmath49 represents an irreversable process correctly .",
    "the phase - space of the dissipationless and dissipative system are shown in fig.[fig:1](a ) and [ fig:1](b ) , respectively .",
    "the gradient distribution is given with color - coded magnitudes and typical trajectories are indicated by white curves .",
    "the phase space is characterized by the zero-(even ) phase and @xmath0-(odd ) phase modes , where the critical points are located .",
    "there is always one stable point at @xmath50 . at @xmath51 , one ( stable ) to three ( two stable , one saddle ) critical points may emerge depending on the values of the model parameters @xmath52 , and @xmath53  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , sample trajectories ( white curves ) show anharmonic closed orbits around stable critical points and open trajectories .",
    "the color indicates that the gradients get steeper in the sp - dominant population imbalance region ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "since the critical points are determined by the @xmath55 condition , the @xmath56-dependent dissipation does not alter the location of the critical points in the phase space but the eigenvalues of the jacobian acquire nonzero real parts such that the stable critical points at @xmath51 becomes source and the critical point at @xmath50 becomes a sink . while the trajectories flow towards the sink points , the phase - slip phenomenon is observed from @xmath57odd-@xmath0-modes to @xmath57even-@xmath0 modes , as reported for the bjj systems  @xcite .",
    "depending on the value of the asymmetry parameter , @xmath53 , the phase - slip occurs with a nonzero change in the averaged population imbalance @xmath58 .    with a larger ( smaller ) dissipation constant , the typical phase - diagram depicted in fig.[fig:1](b ) gets compressed ( extended ) along the phase axis but the features described above remain the same .",
    "thus , while the transient behavior depends on @xmath59 , the final state of the system is independent : @xmath60 and a fixed value of @xmath36 .",
    "in the following , we introduce the set of equations that incorporate a dissipation proportional to the population imbalance , @xmath36 . in the context of bjj systems ,",
    "such a dissipation arises from the finite lifetime of excited states of two condensates in different hyperfine levels in a single harmonic trap connected by tunnelling transitions  @xcite . in the analogous mechanical system of momentum",
    "shortened pendulum , this corresponds to a damping proportional to the angular momentum variable  @xcite , which we consider to be applicable to the soliton - sp system phenomenologically .",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62    the first thing we note here is that this dissipation term can modify the critical points in the phase - space significantly : their existence , location and corresponding jacobian eigenvalues . for determining the critical points , using @xmath55 and the identity @xmath63",
    "we obtain the following root equation in @xmath36 , @xmath64=0 \\label{eq : f(z)}\\ ] ] figure  [ fig:2 ] is a plot this equation for fixed @xmath65 and for ( a ) @xmath66 , and ( b ) @xmath67 , with several order of magnitudes of the dissipation constant @xmath68 .",
    "blue curve is plotted for dissipationless case ( @xmath69 ) for reference . for @xmath66",
    ", @xmath70 is always a critical point as all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) are tangent to @xmath70 at this point , irrespective of dissipation .",
    "this can also be inferred from eq .",
    "[ eq : f(z ) ] .",
    "critical points close to @xmath71 are most sensitive to the dissipation strength and they already disappear at weak dissipation ( @xmath72 ) . for @xmath67",
    ", as the dissipation gets stronger , the critical points collide and annihilate in pairs .",
    "this is actually indicating the presence of saddle - node type bifurcations in the system which we show further below .",
    "finally , above @xmath73 no critical point is present in the phase space . the sensitivity of the critical points to the dissipation strength increases rapidly after @xmath74 .",
    "table  [ table : damp ] classifies the critical points at different dissipation regimes for @xmath67 .",
    "complex eigenvalues of the jacobian with positive ( negative ) real part define spiral source ( sink ) points and saddle have zero eigenvalues .",
    ".classification of fixed points at different dissipation regimes for fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : codim2_bifurcations ]",
    "in this work , we investigated the dynamical features of a dissipative nonlinear josephson junction which is formed by a paraxial optical soliton surface - plasmon coupled system . the most notable part of the heuristic model implemented here is the nonlinear nature of the coupling mechanism . for a dissipation proportional to the angular velocity",
    ", the system decays into stable fixed points with constant relative phase and constant average population imbalance .",
    "a particular feature observed here is the phase - slip phenomenon , where the odd-@xmath0 modes of the dissipationless system decay into even-@xmath0 modes . for dissipation proportional to the population imbalance ,",
    "supercritical andronov - hopf bifurcation can occur which is notable in that stable oscillatory modes between the soliton and surface - plasmon fields can be maintained against strong dissipation .",
    "the heavily damped limit resembles the behavior of superconducting josephson junctions in which the system decays rapidly into a unique oscillating state . in view of this analysis",
    ", we propose that the nonlinear josephson junction between the optical soliton and surface plasmons can exhibit interesting dynamical features which may be exploited further based on more rigorous theoretical models .",
