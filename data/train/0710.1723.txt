    "multi - wall carbon nanotubes are a coaxial multi - tube system which is realized by self - assembly .",
    "it was theoretically revealed that electronic inter - tube transfer of the multi - wall nanotubes is negligibly small because of cancellation of inter - tube coupling among different sites due to quasi - periodicity of the system .",

    "inter - tube resistance was measured as a function of extraction distance of inner core tubes.@xcite results show monotonic increase with increase of the extraction distance .",
    "it was also reported that in multi - terminal geometries nonlocal voltage drop occurs in the outer tube when current flows in the inner tube.@xcite this was attributed to electronic inter - tube conduction and inter - tube conductivity was estimated .",
    "inter - tube conduction has also been theoretically studied.@xcite it was revealed that the incommensurability of lattice leads to negligibly small inter - tube conductance as compared to that within each tube.@xcite on the other hand , there have been few theoretical studies on inter - tube transfer in the presence of impurities . in some special cases such as tubes with a",

    "the qualitative behavior of the results is the same in spite of the large variation in the mean free path .",
    "quantitatively , however , small differences exist in both the absolute value and the length dependence .",
    "this difference arises due to the asymmetry of disorder effects between the inner and outer tubes .",
    "in fact the magnitude of the effective inter - tube couplings is larger for the outer tube , @xmath108 , than for the inner tube , @xmath109 , as an average .",
    "this is because the number of sites of the outer tube connected to each site of the inner tube is larger due to the curvature , leading to more cancellation for @xmath109 . in the absence of disorder , this difference of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is meaningless because the conductance is given by the sum of each , which are certainly the same .",

    "the conductance remains the same even if the relative position of inner and outer lattices is changed , for example , by rotating the inner tube around the tube axis and/or sliding it along the axis , except for a slight change comparable to the differences for the tubes with the same distance shown in fig .

    "there remain exceptional cases that the inter - tube conductance can become of the order of the conductance quantum , such as in commensurate tubes@xcite and accidental near - commensurate tubes@xcite in the absence of impurities .",
    "disorder effects in such rare cases are out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the role of impurities is to destroy the cancellation of the inter - tube coupling having quasi - periodic position dependence .",
