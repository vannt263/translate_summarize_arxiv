    "the map @xmath41 can be extended to a hopf pairing @xmath67 .",

    "the second main result of this paper is the insight that giving a pair @xmath52 satisfying the commutation condition with @xmath41 is equivalent to giving @xmath2 the structure of a yetter - drinfeld module for @xmath68 , see theorem [ thm : yd - com - rel - mon ] .",
