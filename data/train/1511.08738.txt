    "since the beginning of the 2000s , it has been known that to characterize finite - frequency current fluctuations in quantum conductors , one has to measure and calculate the nonsymmetrized noise , which corresponds to the emission noise at positive frequency and to the absorption noise at negative frequency  @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the current operators do not commute for quantum systems  @xcite . in taking the symmetrized noise ,",
    "one mixes the emission and absorption parts and the relevant information is lost . despite the growing interest in nonsymmetrized finite - frequency ( nsff ) noise in quantum systems both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , there is no clear and direct interpretation of the physical processes that contribute to the noise , even for non - interacting systems .",
    "here we show that it makes sense to interpret each contribution to the nsff auto - correlators in terms of the energy - transfer process , following the ideas developed by several authors .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the frequency at which the nsff noise is evaluated corresponds to the energy provided or absorbed by the detector @xcite or by the electromagnetic environment , and that current fluctuations produce radiation of photons / plasmons in a phase - coherent conductor @xcite . to address this issue from a theoretical point of view",
    ", one can use either the scattering theory  @xcite or the non - equilibrium green function ( negf ) technique  @xcite . whereas the former method applies to non - interacting systems",
    ", the latter can be extended to interacting ones .",
    "however , the negf technique has been used so far only for the calculation of symmetrized noise @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present two methods to derive the noise spectrum for a quantum dot ( qd ) connected to two reservoirs .",
    "the first method is based on the negf technique and allows us to express the nsff auto - correlators and cross - correlators in terms of the transmission amplitude and transmission coefficient through the barriers .",
    "the second method is based on a detailed analysis of all the different physical processes that contribute to the auto - correlators by emitting energy in one reservoir , paying attention to considering the coherent superposition of scattering paths when more than one process is involved .",
    "the cross - correlators can not be obtained within the second method , but we check that for the auto - correlators the two methods lead to the same expressions .",
    "we benchmark our results with the known results existing in the literature in some given limits , notably in the non - interacting limit when the scattering theory can be used , and we discuss the charge fluctuations in the qd .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the system , the model , and the details of the nsff noise calculation within the negf technique , and we discuss the results . in sec .",

    "iv the conditions to get distinct auto - correlators in the left and right reservoirs , and we discuss the differential fano factor profile .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "we consider a qd connected to two reservoirs described by the non - interacting single - level anderson hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the left ( @xmath2 ) and right ( @xmath3 ) reservoirs , @xmath4 is the transfer hamiltonian , and @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the qd . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators of one electron in the reservoirs ( qd ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the qd energy level , the energy of an electron with momentum @xmath11 in the reservoir and the transfer matrix element between the corresponding states .",

    "moreover , the coupling strength between the qd and the reservoirs , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the density of states in the reservoir @xmath16 and @xmath44 , is assumed to be energy independent ( exact in the wide band limit ) .",
    "in addition , we consider symmetric coupling @xcite , i.e. , @xmath45 .      within these assumptions , we obtain the following expression for the nsff noise @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath48 , and where the matrix elements @xmath49 are listed in table  i. they are expressed in terms of the transmission amplitude @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the qd retarded green function , and of the transmission coefficient @xmath52 through the barriers .",
    "the nsff noise is composed of four contributions , each of which is given by the integral over the energy @xmath53 of the matrix elements @xmath54 weighted by the product of the electron distribution function @xmath55 and hole distribution function @xmath56 .",

    "this sum is non - zero only when @xmath63 acquires an energy dependence , as it is the case for example when the system is coupled to an electromagnetic environment  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that our result for @xmath58 differs from the expression of the nsff noise given in ref .",

    "it consists in identifying the physical processes involved in the generation of current noises . for this",
    ", one must go back to the definition of the noise given above , stating that it is the fourier transform of a two - particle correlator , say , for instance , @xmath90 for the auto - correlator in the left reservoir . from this and",
    "due to charge and energy conservation , one can see that @xmath91 corresponds to the transition probability from an initial state formed by creating a pair of one electron with energy @xmath53 and one hole with energy @xmath92 in either the left or the right reservoir , to a final state where the electron - hole pair is located in the left reservoir and then recombines emitting energy @xmath78 on the left reservoir side .",
    "[ figure1 ] illustrates all the possible processes along which the system transits from such an initial state to that final state .",
    "note that in order to contribute to the noise , the physical process must allow either the electron or the hole of the electron - hole pair to experience an excursion into the qd .",
    "we first discuss the contributions to @xmath58 when one starts from an initial state with an electron - hole pair located in the left reservoir , i.e. , proportional to @xmath93 . in this case , there exist three distinct processes allowing the electron or the hole to experience an excursion into the qd : in the first process , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a@xmath83 ) , the hole of the initial electron - hole pair is reflected by the left barrier while its electron partner moves back and forth between the left reservoir and the qd before emitting energy @xmath78 by recombining with its hole partner in the left reservoir .",

    "[ figure1](a@xmath84 ) , the hole of the electron - hole pair moves back and forth between the left reservoir and the qd while its electron partner is reflected by the left barrier before emitting energy @xmath78 by recombining with the hole present in the left reservoir .",
    "its amplitude reads @xmath95 .",

    "[ figure1](a@xmath85 ) , both the hole and the electron of the electron - hole pair move back and forth between the left reservoir and the qd before emitting energy @xmath78 by recombining together .",
    "its amplitude is @xmath96 .",
    "these three processes lead to the following contribution to the noise : @xmath97 corresponding to the coherent superposition of the three transmission processes in question . the amplitudes rather than the probabilities have to be summed over the different processes since the wave function of the system is anti - symmetric under exchange of particles due to the pauli principle . as a result ,",
    "the processes in which electrons or holes are either transmitted or reflected are not distinguishable @xcite .",
    "we have checked that @xmath98 is identical to @xmath99 using the relations : @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these latter two relations hold for the non - interacting single - impurity model with symmetric barriers .",
    "the former relation arises from the matrix relation @xmath102 connecting the @xmath103 matrix and the scattering matrix , whereas the latter relation corresponds to the generalized optical theorem @xcite resulting from the unitarity property of the @xmath103 matrix  holding when only elastic scattering of electrons occurs , as is the case here  providing that the former relation is satisfied .",
    "the physical processes involved in the three other contributions to the noise @xmath58 can be identified in the same way . for the contribution proportional to @xmath104 ,",
    "one has to start from an initial state in which both the electron and the hole of the pair are in the right reservoir .",
    "there is a single process as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) .",
    "both the electron and the hole have to move across the entire structure from the right to the left reservoir through the qd before recombining to emit energy @xmath78 in the left reservoir .",
    "the latter process leads to the following contribution to the noise : @xmath105 , which is identical to @xmath106 .",
    "the same analysis can be carried out for the last two contributions proportional to @xmath107 and @xmath108 leading to the identification of processes ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",

    "similar physical processes can be found to explain the contributions to @xmath59 .",
    "it is not possible , however , to find such a simple picture for the nsff cross - correlators @xmath61 and @xmath62 since they are not real , and thus they are nonobservable quantities @xcite .",
    "to illustrate our results , we use the following exact form for the dot electron green function in the non - interacting anderson single - impurity model , @xmath115 .",
    "this expression leads to a lorentzian - type expression for the transmission amplitude @xmath69 , where we recall that @xmath109 is the coupling strength between the qd and the reservoirs and @xmath8 is the qd energy level .",
    "the auto - correlator and the cross - correlator spectrum , as well as the fano factor defined as the ratio between the zero - frequency noise and the current , are quantities that are well discussed in the literature @xcite . here",
    ", we choose to focus on the following features : the conditions to observe distinct auto - correlators in the left and right reservoirs , and the profile of the differential fano factor .      from table",
    "[ table1 ] , we see that the expressions for the auto - correlators in the left and the right reservoirs are distinct . for example , in the zero - temperature limit and at positive frequency and positive bias voltage , the auto - correlators are given by @xmath116~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath117~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are non - equal when the frequency is non - zero and when the transmission coefficient is energy - dependent .",
    "such a difference between the left and right auto - correlators is also reported in refs .",

    "<S> we identify the different energy - transfer processes involved in each contribution to the auto - correlator , and we highlight the fact that when there are several physical processes , the contribution results from a coherent superposition of scattering paths . varying the gate and bias voltages , we discuss the profile of the differential fano factor in light of recent experiments , and we identify the conditions for having a distinct value for the auto - correlator in the left and right reservoirs . </S>"
