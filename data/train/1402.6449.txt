    "although planck @xcite has already given the dark matter(dm ) relic density @xmath10 with a high precision , we still do not know particle physics nature of dm at all .",
    "so far all the compelling evidences for the existence of dm come from astrophysics and cosmology , due to its gravitational interaction .",
    "still , many particle physics models for dms have been proposed , and most of them have a stable collisionless cold dm(ccdm ) candidate whose self - interaction can be ignored .",
    "the collisionless cold dm has been very successful when explaining the large scale structure of our universe .",
    "however , anomalies from the small scale astrophysical observations  @xcite indicate that dm may have strong interactions between themselves .",
    "such self - interaction  @xcite would make dm have a flat core density profile rather than a cusp one predicted by ccdm .",
    "recent simulations show that in order to flatten the cores of galaxies the cross section for dm scattering should be around @xmath11  @xcite , which is in fact a huge cross section compared with typical weak - scale cross sections @xmath12 barn or @xmath13 pb . some light particle mediator in the dark sector could be an origin of such strong self - interaction between dms .    in this paper , we propose a scalar dm model with a local @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "unlike models based on global symmetries , local discrete symmetries can protect symmetry - breaking from quantum gravity effects and guarantee the longevity or absolute stability of dm particles .",
    "also a light mediator can exist in the models with local symmetry , and generate the correct self - interaction for dm in explaining the anomalies mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model with a local @xmath3 symmetry , establish the convention for parameters and give the physical mass spectra . then we discuss both theoretical and experimental constraints on the parameters in sec .",
    "iii . then in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the relic density and dm direct searches , paying attentions to the semi - annihilation feature , and compare with the global @xmath3 mode . in sec .",
    "v , we show that a light scalar mediator in our model can induce strong interaction for dm . finally we summarize the results in sec .",

    "we are interested in the phase with the following vacuum expectation values for the scalar fields in the model : @xmath23 where only @xmath24 and @xmath25 have non - zero vacuum expectation values(vev ) .",
    "this vacuum will break electroweak symmetry into @xmath26 , and @xmath14 symmetry into local @xmath3 , which stabilizes the scalar field @xmath1 and make it dm .",
    "the discrete gauge @xmath3 symmetry stabilizes the scalar dm even if we consider higher dimensional nonrenormalizable operators which are invariant under @xmath2 .",
    "this is in sharp constrast with the global @xmath3 model considered in ref .",
    "also the particle contents in local and global @xmath3 models are different so that the resulting dm phenomenology are distinctly different from each other .",
    "other vacuum configurations could exist , such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 which give rise to both broken @xmath14 and @xmath0 but also no dark matter candidate .",

    "there could exist other differences between local and global @xmath3 models . depending on the exact value of @xmath85 , @xmath41 and other physical parameters",

    "on the other hand , only isospin - conserving couplings between dm and nucleon exist in global @xmath3 model through the higgs mediation , if we neglect small isospin violation from @xmath131 .",
    "therefore one can have two independent channels in the dm - nucleon scattering amplitude , which might be helpful to understand the recent data on direct detection of dm in the light wimp region  @xcite .",

    ".    finally , when @xmath85 or / and @xmath41 is about @xmath132 , sizable dm self - interaction could be realized , which is motivated to solve the astrophysical small scale structure anomalies .",

    "the eft is that the direct detection cross section due to the renormalizable operator @xmath136 is strongly constrained so that the scalar dm can not be thermalized if it is light .",
    "note that within the eft picture there is no room for @xmath6 or @xmath137 to enter and play important roles in direct and indirect detection or in the calculation of dm thermal relic density .",
    "this is because we do not know which fields are relevant ( or dynamical ) at the energy scale we are considering . without constructing a full theory",
