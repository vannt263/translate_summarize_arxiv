    "the progressive miniaturization of lasers , begun with the introduction of the vcsel  @xcite , has opened a wealth of questions related to the operation of very small devices .",
    "problems with the definition of threshold were recognized very early on  @xcite and still persist  @xcite , and difficulties with a quantitative interpretation of correlation functions have been more recently pointed out  @xcite .",
    "failure of traditional continuous modeling based on rate equations has been widely recognized and is discussed in detail in  @xcite and various alternatives exist to predict the behaviour of small lasers .",
    "in essence , the difficulty arises from the strongly discrete and stochastic nature of the problem and the limited number of spontaneous emission channels in the cavity .",
    "we can distinguish two classes of stochastic models : 1 .",
    "those which describe the evolution of the ensemble , either predicting the static features or their statistical dynamics , and 2 . those which predict the detailed dynamics . to the first class belong monte - carlo simulations , which have been recently applied to lasers with success  @xcite , and fokker - planck models which have a long history in laser physics  @xcite .",
    "the master equation clearly belongs to the second class , since it allows for detailed predictions of the dynamical evolution of the system , but its use becomes unwieldy when the number of elements ( modes of the e.m .",
    "field ) exceeds a few units .",
    "a practical reduction to a random walk on a lattice has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "recently developed quantum models  @xcite are to be ascribed to this second group .",
    "the aim of our stochastic simulator ( ss ) is to provide a tool for rapid computation predicting the laser dynamics and its emergence from the spontaneous emission , without the mathematical assumptions normally associated to the derivation of a differential description .",
    "rather , we set up an ensemble of very simple ( semiclassical ) rules reproducing the physics of the interaction between radiation and matter , and let the ss predict the sequence of events which will occur , on the basis of the randomness of each occurrence .",
    "the advantages of this choice are that : a. it provides extreme computational efficiency , thus offering the possibility of quick dynamical predictions and of performing averages over wide samples ; and b. letting the operator _ observe emerging dynamical aspects _ which otherwise would be either washed out ( in stationary approaches ) or reproduce the statistical characteristics of the modelling choice ( rate equations with langevin noise , meaningful only for large enough averages  @xcite ) rather than those intrinsic to the physics of the process near threshold .",
    "we remark that the present proposal for a ss aims at modeling only the basic ingredients necessary for a description of laser action .",
    "this choice is dictated by the interest in identifying those elements which are essentially intrinsic to the stochastic nonlinear process .",
    "refinements are possible , and planned , to include specific effects which will allow for a closer description of particular kinds of lasers .",
    "a discretization of the rate equations , fulfilling a similar role , has previously been proposed  @xcite , but its scope was strongly reduced by the neglection of the spontaneous emission ",
    "inherent to the rate equations  @xcite  , which precludes the determination of thresholds or of the mixtures of coherent and incoherent photons .",
    "the absence of the latter entirely removes the interplay spontaneous / stimulated emission , thereby preventing one from correctly observing the rise of the stimulated component of the laser field intensity .",
    "the stochastic simulator mimics a sequence of events as a succession of possible occurrences taking place at discrete times , with a time discretization ( @xmath0 , cf .",
    "caption of fig .",
    "[ scurve ] ) small compared to the fastest time scale .",
    "indeed , since each process is represented by a probabilistic distribution determining whether and when the corresponding process takes place , the discretization must be sufficiently fine to allow for a correct description of even the fastest process ( the escape of off - axis spontaneous photons  cf .",
    "this ensures that all processes will be described with sufficient accuracy , while most of the processes will have zero outcome at any given step , at least below and around threshold .",
    "-.5 cm   -1 cm    the chain of physical processes which are mimicked by the ss is the following ( cf .",
    "[ schematics ] ) :    * excitation of a _ dipole _ by a pumping mechanism ; * disexcitation of a _ dipole _ through one of the following channels : + * * spontaneous relaxation into an off - axis cavity mode ; * * spontaneous relaxation into the on - axis cavity mode ; * * stimulated emission ( into the on - axis mode ) . *",
    "escape of an off - axis spontaneous photon ; * transmission of an on - axis spontaneous photon through the cavity mirror ; * transmission of a stimulated photon through the cavity mirror .    as detailed in table",
    "[ processes ] , the probability distribution for the pump is taken to be a poissonian ( @xmath1 ) , while all other processes are simulated through a binomial distribution ( @xmath2 ) , since they correspond to yes / no events  @xcite .",
    "all variables  _ dipole _ number ( @xmath3 ) , stimulated photon number ( @xmath4 ) , on - axis spontaneous photon number ( @xmath5 ) , and off - axis spontaneous photon number ( @xmath6 )  need to be defined at all times , independently of their actual value ( e.g. , @xmath7 far below threshold ) , since the ss can only accumulate population numbers in preexisting  categories \" .    .",
    "synoptic of the processes handled by the ss .",
    "the off - axis spontaneous emission results from the difference between the population relaxation events ( @xmath8 ) and the on - axis spontaneous emissions ( @xmath9 ) ; thus no explicit process is associated to this channel ( we assume , for simplicity , all relaxations to be radiative ) . each event ( column 3 ) is computed from the probability distribution ( column 4 ) whose first argument is defined in column 5 .

    "( [ defn][defro ] ) are given in table  [ processes ] , where the parameters appearing in the last column are the usual ones appearing in laser models  @xcite .",

    ", the ss handles the different time scales over which the dynamical evolution of the processes take place by introducing independent , explicit probabilities ( cf .",
    "last column in table  [ processes ] ) .",
    "finally , since the ss accounts for the initiation of stimulated emission randomly starting from a spontaneous event , we introduce the seed @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "table  [ processes ] ) which activates ( producing @xmath22 ) only in the absence of stimulated photons ( @xmath23 ) , in the presence of spontaneous photons in the on - axis mode ( @xmath24 ) , and with probability determined by a random number @xmath25 and a set level @xmath26 .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath26 tunes the probability of transforming a spontaneous photon into a stimulated one , thus initiating the amplification process .    with the values of the laser parameters defined above , the ss is started with the desired value of the pump @xmath17 and initial values for the variables ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the choice of the initial values is not crucial as long as they do not differ by more than a couple of orders of magnitude from the actual averages belonging to the set of parameters chosen , since the ss is run with a transient @xmath27 to let the variables relax .",
    "the first determination of reasonable starting values has to be empirically obtained with sufficiently long runs ( monitoring the averages ) .",

    "the center panel shows the time - dependent stimulated emission output by the laser for different values of pump ( averaged over a @xmath46 time window , to simulate the finite bandwidth of a typical detector ) .",
    "this convincingly shows that in the threshold region ( cf .",
    "corresponding color - coded points in the right panel ) the fluctuations are as large as the average ( black and red curves ) , thus confirming the observations of  @xcite .    as a final point ,",
