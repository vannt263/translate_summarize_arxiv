    "<S> induced charge - density ( icd ) oscillations at the cu(111 ) surface caused by an external impurity are studied within linear response theory . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation takes into account such properties of the cu(111 ) surface electronic structure as an energy gap for three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk electrons and a @xmath0 surface state that forms two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the coexistence of these 2d and 3d electron systems has profound impact on the icd in the surface region . in the case of a static impurity </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic icd oscillations with the @xmath1 decay as a function of lateral distance , @xmath2 , are established in both electron systems . </S>",

    "<S> remarkable examples of that are the visualization of surface - state - originated friedel oscillations of the induced charge - density ( icd ) at metal surfaces @xcite and the investigation of the indirect long - range interaction between adsorbates mediated by these oscillations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated @xcite that at noble - metal ( 111 ) surfaces this interaction , whose energy decays as @xmath1 with the lateral distance @xmath2 between adsorbates , can lead to mutual redistribution of adsorbed atoms up to @xmath2 @xmath4 nm </S>",
    "<S> . this interaction might also be responsible for the rearrangement of adsorbate species on the si(111)-@xmath5-ag surface @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is well known that the 2d electron system responds to the introduction of an impurity by producing friedel oscillations with the characteristic @xmath1 decay @xcite , whereas in the 3d electron gas the oscillations fall off as @xmath7 , @xmath8 being a distance from the impurity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , up to date , the question of how the 2d and 3d systems respond @xmath9 in the vicinity of a metal surface has not been addressed yet . </S>",
    "<S> an answer can be obtained , in principle , from _ ab initio _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> but , at present , these evaluations are feasible only for systems with the lateral distances between adsorbates of the order of several  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ static_map](a ) , one can observe the 2d friedel oscillations in the lateral direction , while in the perpendicular direction the icd behavior is in clear correspondence with the location of surface - state charge - density presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](c ) . </S>",

    "<S> similar behavior is observed for any @xmath2 . inspecting fig .  </S>",

    "<S> bulk '' ( @xmath57 ) transitions @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 , and the summation is performing over these three components . as a result , the icd of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nind_f ] ) can be rewritten as the sum of the partial icd concerned with the contributions of the 2d and 3d systems as well as their mixing @xmath60 where @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the 2d fourier transform of the bare coulomb interaction , each @xmath63 is defined through eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyson ] ) by the corresponding @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the icd shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](a ) comprises three interrelated components @xmath65 which represent the response of the corresponding `` subsystems '' to both the external perturbation ( [ vext ] ) and the electrostatic field created by the two other @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if we neglect the @xmath67 term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi_zero_sum ] ) and approximate the surface - state wave function by the @xmath68-function , we obtain the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the main advantage of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ n_all ] ) over eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nind_f ] ) is the possibility to solve it iteratively and to analyze step - by - step how one component affects the rest and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> actually , by setting @xmath69 , we find @xmath70 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be considered as a first iteration . </S>",
    "<S> then , by substituting the obtained @xmath70 into @xmath71 with @xmath72 , we find the response of the 3d system to the external field and the field created by the icd of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](b ) , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> it explains why the @xmath53 decay of the icd peculiar to the 2d system takes also place in the 3d electron system adjacent to the crystal border . </S>",
    "<S> additionally the screening by the 3d system of the complex perturbation mentioned above is the origin of an alternate behavior of the icd as a function of @xmath30 at a given @xmath2 ( see the white line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](a ) ) .    to emphasize the role of the realistic electronic structure in the surface response , we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](d ) the icd obtained within a jellium model for @xmath73 commonly used for description of cu @xmath74-valence electrons . in this case the distinct behavior of @xmath75 along the crystal surface without any oscillations is clearly seen . </S>",
    "<S> instead , this model gives strong icd oscillations in the direction perpendicular to the surface which are suppressed in the realistic consideration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map](a ) ) due to complicated mutual influence of one `` subsystem '' on the others . </S>",
    "<S> also , at small @xmath2 , this influence leads to the icd penetrating into the bulk only along a straight line at a finite angle away from the surface normal . </S>",
    "<S> similar effect has also been observed in the studies of long - lived adsorbate - induced states at metal surfaces @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath76 for four values of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 for @xmath79 ev , @xmath80 ev , and @xmath81 ev are displaced vertically by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows @xmath85 indicate the singularities positions at @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] +    now we consider the case of the potential ( [ vext ] ) varying in time with some small frequency @xmath77 as @xmath87 . as we deal with the linear system </S>",
    "<S> , the superposition principle would hold true . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , once the response to the given potential is known , the response to an arbitrary time - varying external potential can be evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous static case when the integration in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nind ] ) over @xmath76 is performed along the line @xmath88 of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ states_phase](b ) , here the integration should be performed along the line @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this case the icd depends on time and has the following form @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined through eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nind ] ) and ( [ nind_f ] ) by the real and imaginary parts of the response function @xmath93 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the icd amplitude is @xmath94 and the phase shift @xmath95 is defined by @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a non - vanishing @xmath97 leads to a non - zero phase shift between the icd and external perturbation oscillations ( it means an energy absorption in the electron system ) .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ states_phase](b ) shows , as an example , three lines corresponding to @xmath79 ev , @xmath80 ev , and @xmath81 ev . contrary to the `` static '' @xmath98 line which has only one singularity point at @xmath99 ensuring the friedel oscillations in @xmath75 with the @xmath1 decay , the @xmath100 lines have up to four singularity points ( labeled by @xmath101 ) due to the singularities at lines a , b , and c @xcite , what makes the dynamic response more complex .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and @xmath97 ( b ) induced by the time - varying external perturbation ( [ vext ] ) with frequency @xmath102 ev as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath2 and multiplied by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> note the enhanced scale comparing with the one of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ static_map ] . </S>",
    "<S> other notions are the same as in fig . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] +    commonly , these singularities are similar to that at @xmath99 in the static case . </S>",
    "<S> but , at the cu(111 ) surface the @xmath107 singularity corresponds to the location of the acoustic surface plasmon ( asp ) ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ states_phase](b ) ) , whose origin and nature has recently been studied @xcite . the asp singularity , </S>",
    "<S> appearing due to the coexistence of 2d and 3d electron systems @xcite , is much stronger than the other ones and leads to the @xmath108 -like oscillations , i.e. , with the spatial decay inversely proportional to @xmath2 only . to visualize the distinct nature of singularities at @xmath107 and @xmath109 , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath110 on @xmath76 for @xmath111 is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> one can clearly see that in this case the icd along the surface is dominated by oscillations with @xmath107 wave vector corresponding to the asp . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the icd also contains contributions originated from the other two singularity points , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in general , the structure of the resulting oscillations is quite complicated , but fitted rather well by three @xmath117-like functions . to compare the decay law of oscillations , </S>",

    "<S> the same kind of icd oscillations arises in the 3d system in the proximity of the 2d electron one . as @xmath77 increases , the asp looses its strength due to interband transitions ( see figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> states_phase](b ) and  [ ro_ind_mom ] ) , and oscillations with @xmath107 gradually change their decay behavior from @xmath122 to @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath79 ev the decay obeys the @xmath122 law , while it is proportional to @xmath124 for @xmath102 ev , and @xmath125 for @xmath126 ev .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we nicely reproduce within linear response theory the friedel oscillations of the icd at the cu(111 ) surface caused by a static impurity , taking explicitly into account the realistic surface band structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the coexistence of the 2d electron system with the 3d one has profound impact on the screening properties at the metal surface . </S>",
    "<S> thus , additionally to the @xmath127 icd oscillations in the 2d system along the surface , the same kind of oscillations occurs in the 3d electron system in the region adjacent to the crystal border . in the case of a time - varying potential , </S>",
    "<S> dominant @xmath128 -like oscillations at the surface in both the 2d and 3d electron systems are predicted for low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that these oscillations can lead to a longer - range indirect interaction between atoms and molecules at metal surfaces than it is thought nowadays . </S>"
