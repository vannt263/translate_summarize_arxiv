    "over two decades of concerted theoretical and experimental effort has so far failed to reveal the true nature of the so - called `` hidden order '' ( ho ) in the heavy - fermion material , uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the enigmatic ho state is signaled by a sharp specific heat anomaly at @xmath13 = 17.5 k @xcite , but the nature of the underlying order parameter is unresolved .",
    "this state of affairs has fueled an active subfield of research , with many creative theoretical proposals , and a full battery of experimental techniques brought to bear on the problem.@xcite the eventual explanation for the ho in centered tetragonal uru@xmath0si@xmath0 will need to account for numerous intriguing experimental findings , including strong fermi - surface ( fs ) reconstruction below t@xmath14 @xcite , an antiferromagnetic phase that is reached from the ho phase by applying pressure @xcite but does not appear to affect the fs,@xcite @xmath7-axis polarized spin fluctuations which become gapped and coherent at t@xmath14 @xcite , and most recently , the identification of c4 rotational symmetry breaking of the weak basal - plane spin susceptibility .",
    "@xcite    one of the first experimental signals which seemed to correlate with t@xmath14 was found using elastic neutron scattering .",
    "the first neutron studies revealed the onset of the so - called small moment antiferromagnetic ( smaf ) phase below t@xmath14 , which was characterized by a ( 100 ) ordering wave vector , and a very small ordered moment of approximately 0.03 @xmath15.@xcite the magnetic structure in the smaf phase consists of dipole moments oriented along the @xmath7-axis , with ferromagnetically ordered layers alternating anti - ferromagnetically along the @xmath7-axis ( figure [ fig : moments ] a )",
    ". the reported size of the ordered moment varies from 0.011 to 0.03 @xmath15/u in single crystal samples.@xcite it is now clear that lattice strain can induce stronger sample averaged staggered magnetization possibly through inclusions of droplets of the pressure induced large moment phase,@xcite and @xmath16si nmr places an upper limit of 0.0002 @xmath15 on a homogeneous @xmath7-axis oriented staggered moment that is static on the microsecond time scale ( fig .",
    "@xcite high quality samples at ambient pressure are generally found to have a @xmath170.01 to 0.02 @xmath15 staggered magnetization , with a correlation length in excess of 200  as in the present experiment . whether intrinsic or extrinsic in origin , the size of the ordered moment in the smaf phase is insufficient to explain the size of the specific heat anomaly at 17.5 k within the conventional framework for rare earth and actinide magnetism,@xcite and thus the true nature of the order parameter remains elusive .",
    "a recent study of the magnetic susceptibility of small crystals of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , using the highly sensitive torque magnetometry technique , has revealed c4 symmetry breaking in the basal plane of the tetragonal unit cell.@xcite this symmetry breaking onsets at @xmath13 in small crystals , indicating the formation of domains of the broken symmetry state . since this discovery ,",
    "additional experiments have confirmed the presence of c4 symmetry breaking through nmr line width broadening @xcite and an anisotropic cyclotron resonance signal @xcite .",
    "theoretical proposals have been put forth to explain the c4 symmetry breaking , including spin nematic order @xcite , a spin - orbit density wave @xcite , and a modulated spin liquid phase.@xcite these proposals show how spin rotation symmetry could be broken while respecting time reversal symmetry , and hence avoiding the formation of a magnetic dipole moment in the basal plane . however",
    ", another possibility is also evident : small in - plane ordered dipole moments which have so far escaped detection .",
    "though a small ordered in - plane dipole moment would not by itself account for the change of entropy at the hidden order transition any more than the @xmath7-oriented smaf , its presence or absence is critical to understanding c4 symmetry breaking . a putative transverse staggered magnetization was recently considered in three separate theoretical works .",
    "_ et al__@xcite proposed a spin density wave ( sdw ) involving 5@xmath18 crystal field doublets .",
    "the ( undetermined ) details of the crystal field wavefunctions dictate the size of the in - plane moment induced by such a sdw , which could be vanishingly small .",
    "nevertheless , a small moment of unspecified magnitude pointing along [ 110 ] is expected in this case @xcite .",
    "a second theoretical prediction of a small in - plane moment comes from chandra _ et al _ , who propose the order parameter characterizing the ho phase is hybridization between conduction electrons and local ising - like 5@xmath19 wavefunctions , the combination of which produce an object that breaks both single and double time - reversal symmetry , a so - called `` hastatic '' order which entails a small in - plane moment in the hidden order phase .",
    "@xcite chandra _ et al _ place a theoretical upper limit of @xmath20 = 0.015 @xmath15 on the size of the in - plane ordered moment .",
    "a third paper examines the complete set of multipole correlations allowed in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "employing density functional theory to establish a multi band anderson hamiltonian and augmented rpa theory to account for interactions , a rank-5 multipole ( dotriacontapole ) order with ` nematic ' e- symmetry was found to be critical to a low temperature condensed phase . while no estimate of magnitude is provided , a staggered pseudospin moment along the [ 110 ] direction is concomitant to this order .",
    "although the dotriacontapole order was initially supported by the interpretation of high magnetic field neutron diffraction data , @xcite this conclusion has recently been discounted based on a space group analysis.@xcite furthermore , a recent photoemission study of the fs in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite did not observe features associated with dotriacontapole ordering in ref . .",
    "the photoemission experiment provided evidence for itinerant 5@xmath18 electrons so that theories relating to ( localized ) crystal field wave functions such as refs .",
    "to may be called into question .",
    "nevertheless , even in the absence of a fully consistent theory , in light of the c4 symmetry breaking magnetic susceptibility data , it is of utmost importance to establish whether or not a small dipole moment is formed in the basal plane of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "we therefore performed an elastic neutron scattering experiment to search for a small ordered in - plane dipole moment in a single crystal of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "our measurement puts an upper limit on the possible size of any such moment of @xmath20 @xmath21 0.0011 @xmath15 assuming a magnetic form factor appropriate to the 5@xmath22 electron configuration of u@xmath23 . because the measurement was carried out as close as possible ( @xmath24=(001 ) ) to the origin of reciprocal space ,",
    "the limit is relatively insensitive to the electronic orbital associated with a putative staggered magnetization .",
    "a large single crystal of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 was grown by the czochralski method using a tri - arc furnace at mcmaster university .",
    "the crystal was oriented in the @xmath25 plane and mounted in a helium flow cryostat on the spins triple - axis spectrometer at the nist center for neutron research .",
    "the instrument was configured for elastic scattering with @xmath26 = @xmath27 = 4.7 mev , using a vertically focussed pg(002 ) monochromator and a flat pg(002 ) analyzer .",
    "the full width at half maximum energy resolution for this configuration is 0.27 mev .",
    "cooled beryllium filters were used before and after the sample to eliminate second order ( @xmath28 ) contamination .",
    "spins has a nickel supermirror guide before the monochromator , giving an energy - dependent incident beam divergence of 1 degree @xmath29/@xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the incident wavenumber of the neutrons .",
    "soller collimators ( 80 before and after the sample ) were in place to control the in - plane beam divergence .",
    "the magnetic neutron scattering cross section is sensitive to the relative orientation of the scattering wave - vector , @xmath31 , to the direction of the magnetic moment , @xmath32 .",
    "specifically , the cross section is maximal for @xmath33 and exactly zero for @xmath34 .",
    "thus , for a magnetic structure with moments oriented along the @xmath7-axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moments](a ) ) there is no magnetic contribution to bragg scattering at @xmath35-type positions .",
    "in contrast , for in - plane ordered moment , such as that proposed in refs .",
    ", , and and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : moments](b ) , the polarization factor is largest for @xmath35-type positions . with our experimental configuration",
    ", we can access @xmath25 reflections and differentiate between transverse and in - plane ordered moments by focusing on @xmath36- and @xmath35- type reflections , respectively .",
    "the space group for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is centered tetragonal . the conventional tetragonal unit cell , which contains two formula units , has lattice parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38  at t=293 k and the general selection rule for reflections with miller indices @xmath39 in the corresponding tetragonal reciprocal lattice is @xmath40 . the magnetic structures proposed ( in - plane moment , fig .",
    "[ fig : moments ] b ) ) and measured ( @xmath7-axis smaf phase , fig .",
    "[ fig : moments ] a ) ) , however , break the centering translational symmetry and produce peaks at the nuclear - forbidden positions .",
    "this provides an ideal scenario to search for small magnetic signals on a low background at @xmath39 where @xmath41 , while differentiating between in - plane and transverse ordered moments through the polarization factor .",
    "a note on our choice of incident energy is appropriate .",
    "the use of cold neutrons with low incident energy allows us to analyze the elastically scattered neutrons with an energy resolution of  0.27 mev , thereby excluding inelastic processes which could contribute to overall background and obscure a small signal .",
    "we chose an incident energy of 4.7 mev to avoid the effects of multiple - scattering .",
    "possibilities for multiple - scattering , i.e. where some proportion of the detected neutrons have undergone more than one scattering process before being detected , depend on the incident energy and details of the bragg reflection geometry .",
    "the effect can be strong for large samples such as the one studied here to achieve sensitivity to small moment magnetic ordering .",
    "considering the lattice parameters for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 and our use of the @xmath25 scattering plane , we find there are no multiple bragg scattering processes for the ( 001 ) or ( 003 ) positions and neutron energies from 3.34 to 4.71 mev ( appendix [ sec : multscatt ] ) .",
    "first , we looked for the smaf ordered moment polarized along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "figure [ fig : tdep ] shows the temperature dependence of the ( 100 ) and ( 102 ) peak intensities .",
    "both are allowed magnetic bragg peaks for this type of ordering ( figure [ fig : moments ] a ) ) .",
    "the ( 100 ) and ( 102 ) reflections were collected at 3 minutes and 10 minutes per point , respectively , and the intensity is normalized to a monitor in the incident beam with a count rate of 6100 counts / s .",
    "both reflections show a temperature dependence consistent with a transition near 17.5 k , the hidden order transition temperature .",
    "in contrast , the intensities at ( 001 ) and ( 003 ) , which are sensitive to static in - plane order , show no increase above background .",
    "for this temperature scan , the intensity at the ( 001 ) position was measured for 2.8 hours per point , while ( 003 ) was measured for 55 min per point .",
    "transverse scans at ( 001 ) and ( 100 ) are shown in figure [ fig : transverse ] , at two temperatures , 1.6 k and 25 k. the ( 100 ) peak disappears above the transition .",
    "the ( 001 ) position does not show a peak at either temperature . to prove the trajectory probed actually passed through the ( 001 ) location in reciprocal space we also show data collected without the beryllium filters in the beam ( black filled symbols ) . under those conditions",
    "there is a component of @xmath28 neutrons that diffracts from the ( 002 ) nuclear bragg peak .",
    "it appears exactly where a putative ( 001 ) magnetic peak would occur for @xmath42 neutrons .",
    "there is no sign of a rod of scattering parallel to @xmath7 at ( 001 ) which would manifest as a peak in the transverse scan at both temperatures .",
    "the lack of rods is an indication of reduced stacking faults in this crystal , which is consistent with the relatively small smaf moment ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "@xcite fig .",
    "3(b ) shows transverse scans through the ( 100 ) position . from a flat background in the pm phase ( t=25 k ) a peak develops in the ho phase ( t=1.6 k )",
    "this peak is not resolution limited ( horizontal bar and fig .",
    "5(a)-(b ) ) . a fit of perpendicular scans through ( 100 ) to a lorentzian convoluted by a gaussian leads to correlation lengths of @xmath44=230(12 )   and @xmath45=240(15 )   along the @xmath7 and @xmath46 directions respectively .",
    "previously reported correlation lengths for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 range from 200 @xcite to 400 @xcite for the @xmath46-axis and 100 @xcite to 450 @xcite for the @xmath7-axis .    to determine the size of the out - of - plane magnetic moment @xmath47 and place limits on the in - plane moment @xmath20 , we normalize to the ( 101 ) nuclear reflection , which has the weakest structure factor of any reflection from the uru@xmath0si@xmath0 crystal structure , and",
    "therefore is least affected by extinction .",
    "details of the normalization are given in appendix [ appen ] .",
    "entering into the magnetic cross section is the magnetic form factor , @xmath48 , which is the fourier transform of the unpaired spin density and depends on the spatial distribution of spin density . in the `` hastatic order '' scenario",
    ", @xmath20 contains both conduction electron and 5@xmath49 components , and presumably has a more extended spin density .",
    "figure [ fig : ffact ] shows the magnetic form factor for various spin density distributions .",
    "two possibilities for a localized u moment are shown , namely the 5@xmath19 and 5@xmath49 electronic configuration along with some other possibilities that relate to moments forming from bands derived from ru or si orbitals .",
    "we also reproduce the measured magnetic form factor squared from itinerant magnetic excitations associated with ru in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath50 @xcite . for si",
    ", we show the square of the normalized x - ray atomic scattering factor , tabulated in ref . , which measures the fourier transform of the total local electron density .",
    "these latter approximations are only intended to show plausible variations in magnetic form factor around the ( 001 ) and ( 003 ) positions , and not to represent realistic calculations for spin density in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "we note that because we are basing the size of the upper limit for @xmath20 solely on a measurement at the ( 001 ) position , which has a very small wave - vector ( @xmath51 = 0.65 @xmath29 ) , sensitivity to the choice of form factor is small , approximately 1 % .",
    "upper limits that are based on the ( 003 ) position with @xmath51 = 1.95 @xmath29 are affected much more severely .",
    "thus , though our limit is consistent with that quoted by das _",
    "et al_,@xcite and is stricter than that quoted by metoki _",
