    "since the early days of quantum - chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) played a decisive role in stimulating theoretical ideas and testing them experimentally .",
    "now the theory is well established and perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is well tested in many processes , but the details of lepton nucleon interactions , in particular at small bjorken @xmath0 , and the structure of the proton in terms of parton densities ( pdfs ) are still objects of intensive research , both , experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the understanding of proton structure is of fundamental interest , but also of great practical importance for the quantitative analysis of present and future hadron hadron scattering experiments like those at the forthcoming lhc .    since its beginning in 1992",
    ", the hera accelerator has been a major source of information on proton structure .",
    "the fully inclusive neutral current ( nc ) and charged current  ( cc ) reactions ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ) are particularly suited to unveil the parton densities of the proton due to the comparatively simple and well understood theoretical description of these reactions .",
    "however , to obtain pdfs at large @xmath0 and for the decomposition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 quark flavours , hera data are usually combined with results of other experiments , which leads to additional systematic uncertainties . in particular",
    "it is desirable to determine the @xmath4 quark density by the hera experiments alone , free of nuclear corrections .",
    "this paper deals with collinear pdfs , which contain no information on parton transverse momenta and parton - parton correlations .",
    "constraints on general parton densities ( gpds ) are deduced from some exclusive final states ( see  @xcite ) , while the constraints on collinear pdfs are obtained from inclusive scattering .",
    "after some description of the kinematics and relations of cross sections and structure functions ( section  [ sec : formal ] ) , i first present shortly the most recent data in cc interactions collected by hera ii , the upgraded hera machine which provides longitudinally polarised electron and positron beams at the h1 and zeus experiments ( section  [ sec : hera2 ] ) .",
    "sections  [ sec : nc ] and  [ sec : cc ] present recent nc and cc data which partially have been used already , for pdf fits , which are described in section  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "the measured contributions of charm and beauty production to the proton structure function is shortly discussed in section  [ sec : beau ] , followed by conclusions .",
    "in inclusive @xmath5 scattering the proton structure can be probed by @xmath6 or @xmath7 exchange , i.e. by neutral current interactions , or by @xmath8 exchange , i.e. by charged current interactions .",
    "the nc differential cross section can be expressed in terms of three structure functions , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 \\equiv \\frac { 2\\pi \\alpha^2}{xq^4 } y_+         \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\pm}_{nc}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the four - momentum of the exchanged gauge boson , @xmath16 , the momentum fraction of the proton carried by the parton participating in the interaction , and @xmath17 , the inelasticity , where @xmath18 is the four - momentum of the incident electron ( proton ) .",
    "the term @xmath19 is called  reduced cross section \" .",
    "it is a combination of structure functions directly related to the differential cross section .",
    "the structure function @xmath9 is the dominant contribution in most of the phase space and can , in leading order ( lo ) qcd , be written in terms of the quark densities @xmath20 .",
    "the term @xmath21 , which would vanish in the absence of @xmath7 exchange , contributes significantly only at at high @xmath22 , and is to lo @xmath23 , that is , it is given by the valence quarks .",
    "the longitudinal contribution @xmath11 is important in eq .",
    "( 1 ) at large @xmath24 . at small @xmath0 , to order @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the gluon density .",

    "@xmath30 $ ] + and @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "+ the @xmath4-quark density is therefore directly accessible in @xmath32 scattering , avoiding the nuclear corrections necessary when electron deuteron scattering is used .",
