    "the first run of the lhc has put new physics studies in an interesting place .",
    "a light higgs has been discovered , with a mass of 125 gev @xcite .",
    "this raises hope that standard notions of naturalness may still hold , and that new physics may be not be far away .",
    "in this situation supersymmetry ( susy ) is still the leading candidate for beyond standard model ( bsm ) physics .",
    "however , if susy is indeed the correct paradigm , the favored region of susy parameter space is different than the expectations going into the first run of the lhc .",
    "gluino searches in jets plus missing energy channels now place a lower bound of about 1 tev on gluino and squark masses for mssm models with standard susy mass spectra . the higgs mass measurement itself ( with heavy stops responsible for the one loop higgs mass contributions ) along with flavor physics measurements",
    "demand that the higgs sector parameters fall within in the decoupling limit .",
    "if the mssm is indeed the correct picture , we must learn to live with a heavier mass spectrum and a larger dose of fine tuning .    however , interesting extensions to the mssm scheme exist , among these are r - symmetric models .",
    "these models have dirac gauginos , which require the existence of new chiral superfields which are adjoints under the standard model ( sm ) gauge groups .",
    "the adjoints are the fields that ` marry ' the gluinos with a dirac mass @xcite .",
    "these models present many interesting phenomenological features , and are known to be relatively unconstrained by lhc s first run @xcite .",
    "most models of this type have non - unified gaugino masses , which allow for a more complex sparticle spectra .",
    "they naturally predict heavy gluinos , suppressing gluino pair production , squark pair production and squark gluino associated production . in addition , they allow for complex multi - particle decay chains @xcite .    in a very predictive implementation known as supersoft ,",
    "r - symmetric gaugino masses are generated at the 10 tev scale .",
    "scalar sparticle masses are then generated one loop level down and are finite , cut off by diagrams containing scalars adjoint fields @xcite .",
    "most implementations of r - symmetric models are built in gauge mediated scenarios @xcite , where susy breaking is communicated to sm sparticles through loop interactions with messenger fields .",
    "the mass spectra of r - symmetric models are highly dependent on various one loop effects .",
    "for example , susy breaking masses for scalar adjoints are generated at the same order as gluino masses , and through similar mechanisms .",
    "these scalar masses drastically effect the viability of models , adjoint masses squared must themselves be large and positive to be phenomenologically viable , and they feed into the squark , higgs , and slepton mass spectra .",
    "thus we see that understanding all one - loop susy breaking operators induced by the messenger sector is extremely important .    one place where fully comprehending the effects of the messenger sector is crucial is the higgs - sector",
    ". analyses of the higgs sector of r - symmetric models are intricate , and heavily rely on one - loop effects .",
    "one challenge for r - symmetric models is to achieve a higgs mass of 125 gev while maintaining a viable sparticle spectrum .",
    "it is well known that in the mssm , the tree - level higgs mass may not exceed the mass of the z. large one loop corrections must follow from the stops , the only fields with appreciable coupling to the higgs . these large corrections are aided by large mixing in the stop sector due to large a - terms .",
    "r - symmetric models , however , lack such terms , and therefore new mechanisms must be invoked to raise he tree level higgs mass .",
    "one such mechanism is the so called @xmath1-less mssm or @xmath0mssm .",
    "these models include superpotential terms , allowed by all symmetries , that couple the higgs fields to the new sm adjoints @xcite .",
    "these terms raise the tree level higgs mass through the introduction of new quartic couplings .",
    "we will show that susy breaking effects in these models will produce new , large one loop higgs - mass - corrections similar to stop loops which drastically effect higgs phenomenology .",
    "in addition , as we demonstrate , several r - breaking , loop level operators will be generated once electroweak symmetry is broken including a - like and b - terms and linear terms .",
    "the dynamics of the higgs , and thus the viability of many r - symmetric models , will depend heavily on these susy breaking effects .    in this work we focus on one loop susy breaking effects which make important contributions to low energy spectra in r - symmetric models .",
    "past calculations of scalar adjoint masses have been complicated by their attempted identification with effective operators in the superpotential .",
    "for example , it was first assumed that either the real or imaginary component of scalar adjoint fields must be tachyonic . upon further calculation in specific models ,",
    "this was found not to be the case , however , confusion remained as to the exact operator responsible for the mass .",
    "we find that individual operators do not capture the physics to all orders in susy breaking . instead of relying on effective operators we use the technique of calculating one loop effects by using a simple expansion of messenger propagators in powers of the susy breaking parameters .",
    "we can then easily capture susy breaking effects to all orders .",
    "we present a calculation to any order of the one loop susy breaking masses of scalar adjoints in r - symmetric models .",
    "we also use this technique to calculate the size of susy - breaking operators in the higgs sector which will be necessary for successful electroweak symmetry breaking and higgs mass prediction .",
    "we will introduce new a - like and b - like terms and analyze the higgs potential in favored regions of parameter space .",
    "in section 2 , we review the one loop calculation of dirac masses in r - symmetric models .",
    "we present the history of one loop mass calculation for sm adjoint scalars , and present a new calculation using a power expansion in terms of susy breaking parameters . in section 3",
    "we present one loop calculations for various susy - breaking operators which evolve in dirac gaugino models .",
    "this includes calculations of trilinear a - like terms involving the adjoint scalar , b - terms for higgses and linear terms . in section 4 we review the full higgs - sector scalar potential with general allowed operators in r - symmetric models and explore minima characteristic of supersoft models . in section 5 we present one loop contributions to the higgs masses for a sub - set of models in the @xmath0mssm and demonstrate that these contributions may lead to large corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "dirac gaugino masses may be generated from a complete susy - breaking model through higher dimensional operators .",
    "they require a set of new chiral superfields which are adjoints under the standard model gauge groups .",
    "many implementations of r - symmetric models rely on dimension 4 superpotential operators which involve effective interactions between the gaugino , new adjoint , and a hidden sector @xmath2 field which gets a d term vev .",
    "the relevant operator , known as the supersoft operator @xcite is @xmath3 where w@xmath4 is the @xmath5 field strength , w is the standard model field strength ( either @xmath6 ) and a a standard model adjoint . once the @xmath5 field is set to its susy breaking vev , the operator becomes a dirac mass term mixing the gaugino with the adjoint fermion . here",
    "the coupling @xmath7 may be different for each sm gauge group ( denoted by index j ) , therefore r - symmetric models in general predict that gaugino masses are non - unified .",
    "supersoft susy breaking , so named because it introduces no new divergences to the soft susy breaking parameters , extends the low energy gauge sector of the mssm by introducing an adjoint superfield for each gauge symmetry .",
    "dirac gaugino masses are then generated through the supersoft operator once some hidden @xmath5 obtains a d - term .    in gauge",
    "mediated uv completions of supersoft models , the gaugino mass is generated from interactions with a messenger sector which couples both to the dynamical susy breaking sector , and to the standard model fields .",
    "these are general gauge mediated completions where gaugino and mssm scalar masses vanish as sm gauge couplings are set to zero @xcite@xcite to facilitate the gaugino mass , the messengers must be charged both under the hidden sector u(1 ) , and the standard model gauge group .",
    "this class of models thus belongs under the taxonomy of ` semi - direct ' gauge mediated models , the messengers are charged under the hidden sector gauge groups , but do not participate in the susy breaking itself @xcite .",
    "we can see how @xmath8 is generated , for example , by considering a toy superpotential containing the messengers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are charged under the @xmath11 and are also fundamentals or anti - fundamentals under the sm gauge groups .",
    "this superpotential contains a supersymmetric mass for the messengers , as well as a yukawa - like interaction between the messengers and the chiral adjoint , @xmath12 as the messengers are charged under the broken @xmath2 , they acquire a diagonal non - supersymmetric mass contribution proportional to the @xmath11 d - term . given these interactions",
    ", the gaugino mass follows at one loop level ,    diracmass    ( 120,50 )    giving a dirac mass , m_d ~ as we expect in accordance with the operator in eqn 1 .",
    "an additional consequence of @xmath8 is the shift in the standard model d - terms , @xmath13 which alters the d - term generated higgs quartic as well as generates a mass for the real part of the adjoint field .",
    "in fact , for a heavy adjoint and in the absence of a supersymmetric majorana mass term for the adjoint , one finds that the d - term higgs quartic vanishes .",
    "however , the models we consider below are variants of the @xmath1-less supersymmetric standard model @xcite and therefore contain trilinear superpotential operators coupling the higgs superfields to the adjoint superfields .",
    "these superpotential terms generate tree level contributions to the higgs quartic term as well as additional loop contributions to the higgs mass similar to those gained from stop / top loops as we will see below .",
    "we will see that in addition to the dirac mass , the susy breaking contribution of the messengers also induce a variety of other one loop susy - break effects into the sm sector - from scalar masses to a and b - like terms .",
    "some of these will be of the same order as the gaugino mass , while some will be suppressed .",
    "it is important to note that once the parameters in susy breaking and messenger sectors are chosen , all of the one loop susy breaking contributions are then fixed .",
    "we will first consider the effect of the messenger on the chiral adjoint fields .      in order to shed light on operators which result from effects of messengers",
    ", we will now give a simple example of a susy breaking sector where messengers develop a d - term mass .",
    "one of the simplest hidden sectors which results in a broken @xmath11 d - term is a modified oraifeartaigh model @xcite .",
    "consider the following hidden sector superpotential with a gauged u(1 ) symmetry    w= x ( _ + _ -- ^2 ) + m_1_+z_- + m_2 _",
    "-z_++ w^w^ where the subscripts indicate @xmath11 charges .",

    "the d term is nonzero as long and @xmath16 is unequal to @xmath17 , and is given by d = g^(^2-m_1 ^ 2)(-1 )    the susy breaking is communicated through addition of a set of messengers in the fundamental representation of the sm gauge groups , and which are also charged under the @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest messenger sector we may write is again    w_= m_+ y_iathis messenger sector preserves a messenger parity , that is , the superpotential is symmetric under the interchange @xmath18 .",
    "a more general messenger sector may contain multiple sets of messengers @xmath19 with their own couplings and dirac masses , w_= m_ij _",
    "i+ y_ija_j here , depending on masses an couplings , a messenger parity @xmath20 is not necessarily present . to cancel anomalies",
    "each fundamental must come with an anti - fundamental of opposite charge , however , each * set * of fundamental / antifundamental messengers may have different magnitude of charges under the hidden sector u(1 ) . in the simplest completions @xmath21 s",
    "are given the by vevs of a set of dynamical fields .",
    "one persistent question in the study of dirac gauginos has been about the operators involved in generating the adjoint mass terms .",
    "these masses may have drastic effects on supersymmetric spectra . in supersoft models , it is the real part of the adjoint field that couples to mssm scalars , and appears in 2-loop gauge mediated diagrams which determines their masses .",
    "in addition , parts of the adjoint multiplet may themselves be observable in colliders , and have effects on particle decay chains .",
    "it is therefore crucial for a predictive theory to correctly capture the adjoint mass contributions .",
    "@xmath8 will contribute to the mass of the real part of the scalar in the adjoint superfield , while the imaginary piece will remain massless assuming no other explicit contribution to the adjoint mass .",
    "however , it was noted in the original formulation of supersoft models , @xcite , that once @xmath8 is allowed , there is no symmetry forbidding the ` lemon twist ' operator , @xmath22 which leads to a holomorphic adjoint scalar mass on the order of @xmath23 once the d - terms are inserted .",
    "this operator will in fact lead opposite sign masses for the real and imaginary parts of the adjoint , and thus to a large tachyonic mass for the imaginary component of the adjoint scalar field .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite , that a remedy for this problem comes from considering the full set of one loop diagrams which contribute to the scalar adjoint masses . while the operator above contributes to the holomorphic mass of a ,",
    "in fact , due to messenger loops , there are several diagramatic contributions both to the holomorphic mass and the non - holomorphic mass of a. it is not difficult to show that loops linear in d ( or with any odd power of d insertions ) will cancel since the messengers have opposite charges under the sm .",
    "thus , one must consider diagrams of order @xmath24 as shown below .",

    "however , this operator is not supergauge invariant and can not capture physics of the diagrams above .",
    "in fact , in models with messenger parity the @xmath26 diagrams in fig .  [",

    "[ eq : csaki ] where @xmath14 and @xmath28 are the fields responsible for breaking the hidden @xmath5 and thus generating the non - zero d - term .",
    "furthermore , it was argued in @xcite that this operator is always generated at two loops while in the presence of messenger parity violation it is generated at one loop .",
    "there are some issues with this formulation as well .",
    "while eq  [ eq : csaki ] applies to a non - holomorphic adjoint mass to order @xmath24 , one can imagine generating the adjoint mass through one loop diagrams with multiple d - term insertions along the messenger propagators .",
    "this suggests summing the series expansion of the messenger propagators to obtain corrections to the adjoint mass to all orders in d. we will discuss this in more detail in the next section .",
    "all susy - breaking effects are ultimately fed to mssm fields through messenger loops . in order to fully calculate these effects",
    "we must understand the effect of susy breaking on the messenger propagators . here",
    "we propose a formalism to calculate all loop level susy - breaking mass parameters to any order in the susy breaking parameter d.    consider a toy model containing a single set of messengers @xmath9 and @xmath10 which are a fundamental and anti - fundamental under sm gauge groups , and have opposite charges under the hidden sector u(1 ) .",

    "the tree level higgs masses vary tremendously over the parameter space , with many points actually over - predicting the tree level higgs mass .",
    "we then calculated large one - loop corrections to higgs masses caused by higgs couplings to chiral adjoints .",
    "predictions in these models are very dependent on the messenger sectors .",
    "we see that several susy - breaking parameters including holomorphic adjoint scalar masses are greatly changed by the absence or presence of messenger parity as models with messenger parity raise the order at which operators appear .",
    "once the messenger sector is set , there are definite relations between susy breaking parameters",
    ". many relations between the susy - breaking parameters among r - preserving operators are fixed simply by setting supersymmetric messenger masses and their coupling to adjoints .",
    "dialing the higgs - adjoint couplings gives only a small amount of freedom , mostly to r - breaking parameters whose magnitude is always in any case .",
    "given this predictivity , it is a good avenue for further study to determine if specific uv models can remain phenomenologically viable in all sectors .",
    "this is especially true in the higgs sector were we have found linear terms for singlets , large b - terms for adjoints , and small b - terms for higgses .",
    "our modestly successful test point did not follow from a complete theory .",
    "achieving further independence of the susy breaking parameters , will require models with more structure .",
    "one possibility for further model building is to invoke dirac gaugino models with multiple susy breaking sectors .",
    "such models may have quite rich interesting phenomenology , see for example @xcite .",
    "one may , for example , have a susy breaking sector with broken u(1 ) gauge symmetry , in addition to a sector with f - term susy breaking allowing for f - term susy breaking through new messengers with yukawa mediation instead of gauge interactions .",
    "this could induce new one loop a - like terms and adjoint soft masses .",
    "r - breaking , however would be sequestered from gauginos at leading order",
    ". these models will be topics of further study .",
    "another interesting avenue would be retrofitted models , building mass parameters in the superpotential that are due to gaugino condensation@xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for an example of a model combining these terms with supersoft operators ) .",
