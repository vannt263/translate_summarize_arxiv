    "by perelman s proof of thurston s geometrization conjecture  @xcite , it is known that the interior of every compact @xmath0-manifold has a canonical decomposition into geometric pieces , all but a few classified pieces have a unique hyperbolic structure . to calculate the hyperbolic structure on the pieces with torus boundary , thurston@xcite introduced a system of algebraic equations , called the hyperbolic gluing equations .",
    "the idea is to ideally triangulate the manifold into euclidean tetrahedra and realize each tetrahedron as a hyperbolic ideal tetrahedron by assigning the shape parameter , a complex number with positive imaginary part .",
    "he showed that the shape parameters satisfy the hyperbolic gluing equations ; and conversely , a solution to the hyperbolic gluing equations , if exists , gives rise to the hyperbolic structure .",
    "in general , the hyperbolic gluing equations are very difficult to solve . instead of directly solving the hyperbolic gluing equations",
    ", casson@xcite introduced the notion of angle structures which assign dihedral angles to the tetrahedra that satisfy a system of liner equations and strict linear inequalities .",
    "he then showed that among all the angle structures , the one that has the maximum volume , if exists , gives rise to a solution to the hyperbolic gluing equations , and hence the hyperbolic structure .",
    "see also lackenby@xcite , rivin@xcite and futer - guritaud@xcite .",
    "using thurston s hyperbolization theorem@xcite , casson also showed that if an ideally triangulated @xmath0-manifold with torus boundary admits an angle structure , then it has a hyperbolic structure .",
    "see also@xcite .",
    "conversely , a recent work of hodgson - rubinstein - segerman@xcite showed that each cusped hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold that satisfies some topological condition has an angled triangulation , i.e. , an ideal triangulation that admits angle structures .",
    "their construction made an essential use of epstein - penner s decomposition of cusped hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds@xcite and a duality theorem of luo - tillmann@xcite relating the existence of angle structures and the non - existence of normal surfaces of certain type .    to calculate the hyperbolic structure on the geometric pieces with high genus boundary ,",
    "luo@xcite introduced the corresponding notion of angle structures , which he termed the linear hyperbolic structures . according to @xcite , an _ angle structure _ on an ideally triangulated @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 with boundary consisting of surfaces of negative euler characteristic is an assignment of a positive real number to each edge of each tetrahedron of the triangulation , called the _ dihedral angle _ , so that the sum of the dihedral angles around each edge is @xmath2 and the sum of the dihedral angles at the three edges in a tetrahedron adjacent to a vertex is strictly less than @xmath3 by the work of bao - bonahon@xcite , the second condition characterizers the dihedral angles of ( truncated ) hyperideal tetrahedra in the @xmath0-dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath4 therefore , an angle structure makes each individual tetrahedron in the ideal triangulation a hyperideal tetrahedron in @xmath5 the volume of an angle structure is defined to be the sum of the hyperbolic volume of the hyperideal tetrahedra determined by the assigned dihedral angles .",
    "luo@xcite showed that the maximum volume angle structure , if exists , gives rise to the hyperbolic metric on @xmath1 with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "our main result in this paper proves the counterpart of casson and hodgson - rubinstein - segerman s results in the setting of angle structures on @xmath0-manifolds with high genus boundary .",
    "we have    [ main ] let @xmath1 be a compact @xmath0-manifold with boundary consisting of surfaces of negative euler characteristic .",
    "then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 admits an ideal triangulation that supports angle structures , 2 .",
    "@xmath1 admits a hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "we are informed by lackenby that ( 1 ) implying ( 2 ) was first known in @xcite . in comparison with @xcite",
    ", we do not require any topological condition on the manifold .",
    "the constructions are inspired by the works of lackenby@xcite and hodgson - rubinstein - segerman@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we recall some basic notions in section [ 2 ] , including hyperideal and flat tetrahedra , angle structures , admissible surfaces and kojima decompositions . in section",
