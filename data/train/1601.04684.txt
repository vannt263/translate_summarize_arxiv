    "frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been widely adopted in wireless communications due to its high - speed data transmission and inherent robustness against the inter - symbol interference ( isi ) . however , traditional rectangularly pulsed ofdm exhibits large spectral sidelobes , resulting in severe out - of - band power leakage . in this case , traditional ofdm will introduce high interference to the adjacent channels . for alleviating this problem ,",
    "various methods have been proposed for sidelobe suppression in ofdm @xcite-@xcite .",
    "more specifically , the windowing technique @xcite extends the guard interval at the cost of spectral efficiency reduction .",
    "cancellation carriers @xcite will consume extra power and incur a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) loss .",

    "n_-continuous symbol padding ofdm ( ncsp - ofdm ) was recently developed in @xcite at the cost of increased complexity in the transmitter .",
    "meanwhile , to enable low - complexity signal recovery in nc - ofdm , several techniques @xcite-@xcite have been proposed .",
    "however , those techniques will also result in complexity load or efficiency reduction .    for reducing the interference of nc - ofdm and avoiding complex signal recovery at the receiver ,",
    "this letter proposes a low - interference nc - ofdm scheme by adding an improved smooth signal in the time domain .",
    "firstly , in the proposed scheme , the smooth signal is generated in a novel way as the linear combination of designed basis signals related to rectangular pulse .",
    "secondly , the basis signals are smoothly truncated by a preset window function to obtain the short - duration smooth signal with shorter length than a cyclic - prefixed ofdm symbol and low interference .",

    "furthermore , we give an asymptotic expression of the spectrum feature of the low - interference nc - ofdm signal , to show that the proposed scheme can maintain the similar sidelobe suppression to traditional nc - ofdm .",
    "lastly , the complexity analysis denotes that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the complexity of nc - ofdm .",
    "in conventional nc - ofdm @xcite , the _ _ i__th transmit symbol @xmath0 follows @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the precoded symbol on the _ _ r__th subcarrier with the subcarrier index set @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the _",

    ", the smooth signal is added with the time sampling interval @xmath20 where _ m _ is the length of the symbol . following the basic idea of td - nc - ofdm",
    ", the proposed low - interference scheme also adds a smooth signal @xmath21 onto the ofdm signal @xmath22 in the time domain , given as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the length of a cp .",

    "the time duration of @xmath33 is truncated by a preset window function @xmath35 , which is considered as a smooth and zero - edged window function , such as triangular , hanning , or blackman window function .",
    "then , the truncated basis signals can be given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the unit - step function , and @xmath38 is calculated by the rectangularly ofdm pulse @xcite , given as @xmath39    on the other hand , by substituting eqs .",

    "v , we will show that the influence of @xmath21 has been effectively reduced .",
    "assume that the first _",
    "n_-1 derivatives of the smoothed ofdm signal are continuous , and the _ _ n__th - order derivative has finite amplitude discontinuity @xcite . thus , according to the definition of the power spectrum density ( psd ) @xcite and the relationship between spectral roll - off and continuity in @xcite , the psd of the low - interference nc - ofdm signal is expressed by @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "indicates that the spectrum of the low - interference nc - ofdm signal is related to the expectation of @xmath62 multiplied by @xmath63 . in this letter ,",

    "shows that the power spectral roll - off of the smoothed signal , whose first _ n_-1 derivatives are continuous , decays with @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , the expression of @xmath75 reveals that the sidelobe is affected by the length of @xmath76 , so that the selection of _ l _ is important to balance ber and sidelobe suppression performance .",

    "the ratio of cp is only 7% of the whole symbol , the assumption is reasonable for practical wireless systems such as lte @xcite .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the simulation results match well with the theoretical analyses with varying highest derivative order _ n_. in section v , with the above parameters , we will show the proposed scheme can maintain the similar spectral roll - off to traditional nc - ofdm .     .",
