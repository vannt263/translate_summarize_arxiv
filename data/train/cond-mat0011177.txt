    "<S> the scattering of the eletron by a domain wall in a nano - wire is studied perturbatively to the lowest order . </S>",
    "<S> the correction to the thermodaynamic potential of the electron system due to the scattering is calculated from the phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> the wall profile is determined by taking account of this correction , and the result indicates that the wall in a ferromagnet with small exchange coupling can be squeezed to be very thin to lower the electron energy .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the magnetoresistance in various magnetic nano - structures such as multilayers , wires and contacts has been attracting growing interest . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance effects in such systems are induced by the spatial variation of the localized magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> hence , to grasp the physics of the resistance due to a domain wall scattering is fundamental to an understanding of the mechanism of the magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical study of this problem goes back to more than 25 years ago by cabrera and falicov@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering mechanism by the wall is due to the non - adiabatic deviation of the electron spin from the local magnetization . in the case of a thick wall with thickness @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath1 being the fermi wave length ) , the electron spin can adiabatically follow the spatial rotation of the magnetization as it traverses the wall , resulting in a negligibly small reflection . </S>",
    "<S> cabrera and falicov thus concluded that the resistivity contribution due to domain walls is important only in a limit of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this limit was unrealistic at that time , where 3@xmath3 metals in the bulk were considered mostly . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent technology has put the problem in the limelight , firstly by the direct measurements of domain wall resistance@xcite and secondly by fabrication of a very small domain wall in nano - scale contacts@xcite . motivated by the recent experiments detailed theoretical studies including the quantum correction in the dirty case@xcite , spin - dependent lifetime@xcite , etc </S>",
    "<S> . have been made@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations revealed that the problem was not as simple as had been believed . </S>",
    "<S> in fact theories predict that even the sign of the domain wall contribution to the resistivity depends on temperature , system size , amount of disorder as well as the material , and experimental results indeed show such diversity . </S>",
    "<S> a clarifying explanation of the whole behavior observed in wires has not given so far . </S>",
    "<S> in nano - scale contacts , the situation seems to be simpler . </S>",
    "<S> there the wall is believed to be constrained in a small contact region of an atomic scale due to a rapid change of the contact shape , and thus adiabaticity does not hold , resulting in strong scatterings@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent experiment on ni contacts revealed a magnetoresistance of about 300% at room temperature@xcite , which is significantly large compared with other giant magnetoresistive materials such as multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> the result has been interpreted as due to a strong electron scattering by a domain wall , which is trapped in the narrow contact region in the absence of the magnetic field , and which is expelled by applying a magnetic field@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong scattering by the wall in nano magnets suggests that the electronic state is modified . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is studied by looking at the phase shift , @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the transmission coefficient due to the domain wall scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this phase shift is related to the total energy of the electron system through the equality @xmath6@xcite , where @xmath7 is the density of states and @xmath8 is the energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus the stability of the electron system in the presence of the domain wall can be discussed in term of the phase shift .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the scattering and the stability of the electronic state has been studied in the non - magnetic case . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it was shown in a au contact that the tensile force of the contact as the contact is stretched is related with the conductance and becomes maximum when the conductance shows a plateau with a quantized value of integer times @xmath9@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the electron system is stabilized when the conductance takes a quantized value . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior has been explained considering the scattering by the potential energy in the constriction during the prolongation and taking account of the energy shift of the electron system , which is calculated from the scattering phase shift by use of the above relation@xcite .    in the case of ferromagnetic wires and contacts , a domain wall may affect the stability of the electrons and thus the wall structure can be modified to lower the electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> the essential parameter of the wall which governs the transmission coefficient is the thickness , @xmath10 . in this paper the thermodynamic potential of the electrons </S>",
    "<S> is calculated as a function of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this thickness is determined to minimize the total energy of the wall , i.e. , the magnetostatic energy plus the electron energy . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting point is that in 3@xmath3 metals the energy scale of the electron , @xmath11 , is much larger than that of the magnetization , the exchange ( @xmath12 ) and anisotropy ( @xmath13 ) energies . </S>",
    "<S> thus even a small effect of the scattering of the electron might results in an energy shift comparable to the magnetostatic energy . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it will turn out that this is the case in a ferromagnet with small @xmath12 , and the wall would be compressed to be very thin , @xmath14 .    considering a narrow wire , </S>",
    "<S> the system is treated as in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the electron channels considered here are those which contribute to the transport and the quantized behavior of the conductance is not discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the exchange interaction between the electron spin and the local spin and the hamiltonian is    @xmath15    where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 being the fermi energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin index is denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the pauli matrix ( spin indices are suppressed in the second term ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the local spin @xmath20 has a spatial dependence of a domain wall . in terms of a polar coordinate @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> the wall is represented as @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the thickness of the wall . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed we carry out a local gauge transformation in the electron spin space so that the @xmath27-axis is chosen to be along the local direction of spin @xmath28@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation is written as @xmath29 , where the electron in the new frame is denoted by @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is modified to be @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33is the energy of uniformly polarized electron with the exchange splitting @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath35 describes the interaction between the electron and the wall and is given by @xcite    @xmath36 , \\ ] ]    where    @xmath37    is a domain - wall form factor and @xmath38 is the system size . note that @xmath39 for @xmath40 and so the interaction is localized near the wall . the spin - conserving process in the rotated frame as the electron goes through the wall corresponds to the adiabatic process , where the electron spin follows the rotation of the magnetization , and the spin flip corresponds to the deviation from adiabaticity .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction @xmath35 leads to a scattering of the electron and thus contributes to a resistivity due to the wall as has been discussed before based on a linear response theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we study the phase shift due to the scattering , calculating the @xmath41-matrix perturbatively with respect to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function corresponding to the incoming state with the energy @xmath42 and the spin @xmath43 , which we denote as @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the final state spin ) , is calculated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the free green function and @xmath48 , @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the transmission and reflection coefficients are defined from the asymptotic behavior as @xmath50 the result is @xmath51 by use of these coefficients , the resistance due to the wall is calculated based on the landauer s formula ( with two - terminals ) as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the resistance without the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal ( spin @xmath43 ) component of the transmission coefficient for the incoming wave vector of @xmath55 is calculated as @xmath56 the diagonal component of the phase shift , which is defined as @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , is obtained as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and p denotes taking the principal value . in the adiabatic limit of large @xmath61 , the phase shifts of two spin channels acquire berry s geometrical phases@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase shift difference of the two channel become @xmath62 since the solid angle of the rotation of local magnetization is @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase shift contributes to the change of the density of state of the electron according to the relation @xmath63@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the thermodynamic potential of the electron system ( defined as @xmath64 ) is shifted due to the scattering by an amount of @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an irrelevant constant ( independent of domain wall parameter ) , which we neglect . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fermi distribution function at zero temperature ( @xmath69 is the step function ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this expression of @xmath70 is also obtained directly by evaluating the diagrams described in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figdiag]@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact these contributions are calculated as @xmath71 ,      \\label{delom}\\ ] ] which is equal to ( [ delom0 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the expression ( [ delom0 ] ) reduces after @xmath72-summation to @xmath73 .      </S>",
    "<S> \\label{delom2}\\ ] ] to proceed , we approximate the profile of the wall to simplify the calculation . in the case of an ideal wall determined solely by the exchange and uniaxial anisotropy , the profile is @xmath74 and so @xmath75 . by noting that the essential feature of the wall is that the form factor @xmath76 is large only for @xmath77 , we here replace @xmath78 for @xmath77 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have checked that this approximation does not change the result very much . ) by this approximation the energy shift is calculated as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 the minus sign of @xmath84 indicates that the electron system is stabilized in the case of a thiner wall ( @xmath85 ) which causes a strong scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the two spin channels are mixed by the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath86 grows at smaller @xmath87 as plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figf ] . the result ( [ fdef ] ) of the perturbative calculation is not justified at @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus estimated the function @xmath86 non - perturbatively by calculating the transmission amplitude by the recursive green s function method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have used discretized form of the hamiltonian eq.([1 ] ) with a tight - binding approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the result of function @xmath89 is potted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figf ] as dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath89 turns out to depend on @xmath90 only very little in the region physically meaningful ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) , which is consistent with the perturbative result ( [ fdef ] ) . it is seen that the perturbative result ( solid line ) gives a good approximation to the full result .    in the case of an insulating magnet </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the domain wall is determined solely by minimizing the magnetostatic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetostatic energy is written as @xmath92 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the exchange and anisotropy energies per site , respectively and @xmath93 is the lattice spacing ( we assume that the anisotropy energy @xmath13 includes the contribution from the dipole energy ) . in the ideal case </S>",
    "<S> the wall thickness is given by @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the case where the wall is thinner compared with the bulk case , @xmath95 , where the effect of the electron can be important . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the cross - section of the wire is only weakly varying in the length scale we consider , and thus neglect the effect from the wire geometry discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetostatic energy of the wall is thus dominated by the exchange term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ emdef ] ) . by approximating the wall as @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the magnetostatic energy is obtained as @xmath99 in the metallic case the total energy due to the wall is given by the sum of the electron part and the magnetic part ( @xmath100 ) : @xmath101 it is seen that the electron energy and magnetostatic energy compete with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath102 is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figew ] . </S>",
    "<S> only the region of very small @xmath10 is plotted since for larger @xmath10 the functions vary monotonically .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter which determines the relative strength of the two energies is @xmath103 where a factor of 0.1 is to take into account the value of the function @xmath86 at @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath105 exceeding 1 indicates that the wall energy can be lowered if the wall becomes very thin . in 3@xmath3 transition metals such as ni , @xmath106ev , @xmath107ev and @xmath108 , and thus @xmath109 in the case of @xmath3-band . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the electron part is not strong enough to modify the domain wall structure . as is seen from the figure , in the case of @xmath110 , if @xmath12 is as small as @xmath111 , the wall is compressed to become an atomic size , @xmath112 . in a strong ferromagnet with @xmath113 the crossover value below which the electron energy wins occurs around @xmath114 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath12 is smaller than the threshold value , the wall is very thin and so leads to an almost perfect reflection @xmath115 for channels below the threshold and @xmath116 for those above . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the wall is self - organized to give rise to a quantized value of the conductance , just as the wire shape does during the prolongation in non - magnetic wires@xcite . in recent experiment of ni contacts clear </S>",
    "<S> quantization of the conductance in unit of @xmath9 has been observed under zero and small magnetic field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a possible existence of a domain wall has been suggested there , but naively domain wall in nano - contact is expected to lead to a deviation from the conductance quantization since it gives rise generally to a transmission probability of @xmath117 . the present mechanism might be relevant to the clear quantization observed , since suppression of the effective exchange coupling @xmath118 is expected in nano - contacts due to low - dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> ( the suppression of @xmath119 is indicated in experiments on films as a decrease of ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath120 ) as the thickness is reduced@xcite . )    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the importance of the wire shape on the wall structure has been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is due to the shape anisotropy and so the relevant energy scale is @xmath12 or @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the compression of the wall by the electron system would be more important in ferromagnetic wire with small @xmath12 or large @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated in one - dimension but the present result would qualitatively hold in the bulk case as well .    suitable system for experiments would be a low @xmath121 ferro- or ferri - magnetic materials . </S>",
    "<S> the present study indicates that in the metallic case there can be a crossover value of @xmath12 , below which @xmath10 becomes of order of lattice spacing . from the point of view of controlling the electron density </S>",
    "<S> , experiments on magnetic semi - conductors might be interesting .    to summarize , the energy shift of the electron system by the scattering by a domain wall has been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the result indicates that the wall lowers the energy of the electron system and the effect is larger for a thiner wall than a thick one . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution thus competes with the magnetic exchange energy , which favors a thick wall . in 3@xmath3 metals in the bulk </S>",
    "<S> the effect turns out not to be strong enough to affect the wall structure , but it can dominate in the case with smaller @xmath12 or a larger splitting or in nano - wires , in which cases the wall is squeezed by the electron system to be about an atomic scale . </S>"
