    "in the determination of the ckm ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ) matrix element @xmath3 from experiment of the exclusive decay @xmath4 the heavy quark symmetry plays an essential role , because the universal form factor @xmath5 , so called the isgur - wise function , is normalized to be one at zero recoil in the infinite heavy quark mass limit .",
    "however the differential decay width for this process disappear at the zero recoil point , so that one needs to extrapolate the experimental data to this point .",
    "the lattice computation of the slope @xmath6 enables this extrapolation in a model independent way . on the lattice bernard , shen and",
    "soni @xcite and the ukqcd collaboration @xcite have computed the isgur - wise function using the propagating quarks ( wilson fermion and clover fermion respectively ) for the heavy quark .",
    "since the heavy quark mass should be below the lattice cutoff in this framework , present simulations are performed around the charm quark mass .",
    "an alternative way of treating the heavy quark is to use the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) on the lattice .",
    "mandula and ogilvie formulated the lattice hqet and applied it to a calculation of the isgur - wise function@xcite .",
    "their simulation , however , suffers from much noise so that the extraction of the ground state seems to be difficult .",
    "this problem is well known in the calculation of the heavy - light decay constant using the static approximation where one is forced to use some method to enhance the signal of the ground state@xcite or to introduce @xmath7 terms in order to decrease the statistical noise@xcite .",
    "our calculation is based on the lattice hqet keeping a part of the @xmath7 correction terms .",
    "the inclusion of the kinetic term of the heavy quark reduces the statistical noise significantly and enables us to extract the ground state reliably .",
    "we calculate the isgur - wise function for three values of the heavy quark mass and discuss @xmath7 effect on it .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the formulation of the lattice hqet including @xmath7 corrections . in section 3",
    "we describe our numerical simulations and discuss the results . in this section , after brief account of simulation parameters , we first mention about the renormalization of classical velocity",

    "@xmath10 is a lattice covariant derivative and @xmath11 is a chromo - magnetic ( electric ) field .",
    "this action is a generalization of the non - relativistic lattice qcd ( nrqcd ) for finite velocities .",
    "the first term corresponds to the action in the infinite mass limit used by mandula and ogilvie @xcite and the second term describes the @xmath7 corrections .",

    "for simplicity we neglect the spin dependent interaction term @xmath16 from the action and the @xmath7 correction term from the field redefinition , i.e. the second term in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath7 corrections are not included completely with this approximation , but the kinetic term describes the motion of the heavy quark inside the meson and gives a major @xmath7 effect .",
    "the heavy quark propagator is obtained by solving an evolution equation @xmath17 and @xmath18 where we used the equation of motion in the infinite mass limit @xmath19 to remove the @xmath20 term from the evolution equation . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined as @xmath23 the cost for the computation of this deterministic equation is much less than one of obtaining the propagator for the wilson fermion using some iterative solver .",
    "a parameter @xmath24 is introduced to stabilize unphysical high frequency modes .",
    "considering the evolution equation for free field , the stability condition to assure the convergence of the equation is @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . according to the definition of derivatives ( [ deriv ] ) , @xmath29 in the last term of ( [ stability ] ) should be @xmath30 . we , however , use @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 because the effect of this term is small for small @xmath31 , and for convenience in later calculation",
    ". similar condition is required in nrqcd @xcite , but in the present case it depends on the heavy quark velocity as well as @xmath2 and @xmath24 .",
    "because of the presence of term @xmath32 high frequency modes of residual momentum do not converge with time evolution for a large value of velocity unless @xmath24 is taken to be sufficiently large . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath33 effect becomes larger for larger @xmath24 , then much large @xmath24 is not preferable .",
    "fixing @xmath24 for a value of @xmath2 , magnitude of velocities are restricted below a certain value .",
    "for the values of parameter used in the present simulation , @xmath34 is restricted to be smaller than 0.25 .",
    "multiplying the projection operator to @xmath35 , the heavy quark propagator in 4-spinor representation is obtained as @xmath36    the isgur - wise function is extracted from the three point correlation function @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a temporal component of the vector current @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a local interpolating field for an initial or a final meson state @xmath41 for which we take the same mass for both initial and final mesons .",

    "taking the following ratio of the three - point functions the exponential factor and the renormalization factor for the vector current cancel and we obtain @xmath49 we use this relation for the calculation of the isgur - wise function .",
    "we used 120 gauge configurations of @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 lattice at @xmath0 in the quenched approximation .",
    "each configurations are separated by 2,000 pseudo - heat bath sweeps after 20,000 sweeps for thermalization . for the light quarks we used the wilson fermion with hopping parameters 0.153 and 0.155 , and obtained propagators under the periodic and diriclet boundary conditions for spatial and temporal direction respectively .",
