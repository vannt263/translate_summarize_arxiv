    "superfluidity@xcite is a spectacular form of hydrodynamics involving dissipationless flow , metastable circulation , and quantization of circulation .",
    "it occurs in liquid helium and cold atomic gases , where it is associated with the condensation of many bosons into a single quantum state .",
    "whether condensates of quasiparticles , such as excitons , would also be superfluids has been discussed for many years , with debate over the physical manifestations@xcite of superfluid hydrodynamics for quasiparticles , the ( related ) role of symmetry - breaking perturbations , and the significance of interactions and thermal equilibrium@xcite .",
    "this question can now be addressed experimentally , with emerging evidence for the condensation of quasiparticles including excitons , polaritons , and magnons .",
    "a particularly interesting system is the quantum hall bilayer at total filling factor @xmath0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bilayer ] ) .",
    "this consists of two closely spaced quantum wells , each containing a two - dimensional electron gas , subjected to a strong perpendicular field @xmath1 so that the lowest landau level in each layer is half - filled .",
    "the tunneling between the two layers is weak compared to the coulomb energy scale .",
    "when the interlayer separation @xmath2 is of the order of the magnetic length @xmath3 , the ground state is believed to be a bose - einstein condensate of interlayer excitons@xcite caused by the coulomb attraction of electrons and holes across the layers .",
    "( note that the holes are unfilled electron states of the lowest landau level of the conduction band . )",
    "flows of these condensed excitons correspond to dissipationless counterflowing electrical currents in the two layers@xcite .",
    "initial evidence of dissipationless transport came from interlayer tunneling,@xcite which exhibits non - zero interlayer currents at negligible interlayer voltages@xcite .",
    "this regime persists up to a critical current , above which dissipation increases rapidly .",
    "the interpretation of transport measurements as evidence@xcite for exciton superfluidity is complicated by parallel charge transport channels , the injection and removal of electrons@xcite at the contacts , as well as possible dissipation in the leads . here",
    ", we show that magnetometry on _ isolated _ bilayers could provide direct evidence for exciton superfluidity , without the complications inherent in transport studies .",
    "we predict that , at low temperatures , the bilayer shows a history - dependent susceptibility .",
    "changes in the in - plane field lead to a persistent diamagnetic moment that is , however , not induced by fields present when the condensate forms .",
    "this discrepancy corresponds to that between the moments of inertia of normal and superfluid helium inferred in a torsional oscillator experiment .    .",
    "applying a weak in - plane field @xmath4 causes counterflowing charge currents as a diamagnetic response .",
    "for an isolated bilayer the current loop closes at the edges of the sample by interlayer tunneling . in an excitonic picture",
    ", this corresponds to the flow of neutral excitons along the bilayer with recombination at the edges . ]",
    "the in - plane magnetic susceptibility of the exciton condensate has previously been considered@xcite in clean bilayers . however , there are very good reasons to expect@xcite that disorder is essential for understanding the observed transport properties of the bilayer at low temperatures . in particular , for quantum hall bilayers , charge disorder nucleates vortices in the condensate@xcite .",
    "therefore , we will study in this work the magnetic properties of a quantum hall bilayer with disorder - induced vortices .",
    "we first consider the zero - temperature limit , and show how dissipationless supercurrents lead to long - lived diamagnetic moments . in current samples , the resulting moments are small [ eq .  ] , but for samples with stronger tunneling the moments can be comparable to the landau diamagnetism .",
    "we also consider the effects of non - zero temperatures , and estimate the dissipation due to thermal creep@xcite of the in - plane flux .",
    "this dissipative mechanism gives rise to a non - vanishing resistance for the counterflow supercurrents , and causes the diamagnetic moments to decay in time .",
    "based on the parameters of current experiments , we expect dissipation to be significant , which is consistent with experimental resistance measurements .",
    "the flux motion in this regime can be studied in transport experiments .",
    "samples deeper in the condensed phase , however , would show persistent counterflow supercurrents on laboratory timescales , whose presence and eventual decay could be observed by magnetometry .",

    "( a non - zero diamagnetic susceptibility remains possible in multiply - connected geometries@xcite or at non - zero frequency@xcite .",
    "we comment on the extension of our results to the corbino disk geometry in sec.[sec : discuss ] . )    at zero temperature , the state of the bilayer is determined by minimizing eq .  , which gives @xmath20 when @xmath21 this is the pendulum equation , containing the josephson length @xmath22 : the characteristic lengthscale over which excitonic supercurrents decay by interlayer tunneling .",
    "this scale is estimated to be on the order of a few microns in experiments .",
    "we will discuss below the decay of excitonic supercurrents by tunneling in the disordered case , which involves a different lengthscale .",
    "it is useful to recall , for comparison with our treatment of the disordered case , the response@xcite of the clean model ( @xmath21 ) to an in - plane field . for small fields",
    ", the ground state will minimize the tunneling energy , and so @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "this is the commensurate state , in which the field induces a long - wavelength counterflow supercurrent @xmath25 , as in eq .  .",
    "thus there is an in - plane magnetic moment of @xmath26 , with the susceptibility @xmath27 we see that the diamagnetic moment @xmath28 increases linearly with the in - plane field @xmath4 in the commensurate state .    in an isolated bilayer , the counterflow currents must vanish at the ends of the sample .",
    "this occurs in the commensurate phase because , as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ etapendulum ] ) , the diamagnetic currents in the bulk of the sample are eliminated by tunneling over a region of size @xmath22 near the sample boundaries ( fig .  [",
    "fig : bilayer ] ) .",
    "however , since the phase @xmath7 is a periodic variable the maximum current which can recombine in this way is given by @xmath29 .",
    "if the diamagnetic current present in the bulk exceeds this value , then a net winding of the phase @xmath7 , in the form of josephson vortices , enters from the boundaries .",
    "this occurs at the field @xmath30 above @xmath31 the system is in the incommensurate phase in which the kinetic energy of the counterflow supercurrents dominates so that @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the net winding in @xmath7 along the sample implies that the counterflow supercurrents have weak oscillations around zero along the sample , and the diamagnetic moment is small .",
    "the field @xmath31 marks the field above which the diamagnetic susceptibility rapidly decreases from @xmath34 as josephson vortices fill the system and compensate the diamagnetic contribution in eq .  .",
    "while in the clean limit the phase twists nucleated at the boundary propagate into the bulk , in the disordered case any such phase twists can be pinned by the disorder . they can thus be kept out of the bulk of the sample , which can continue to contribute the full diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath34 . to describe this effect quantitatively",
    "we shall use the collective pinning theory we have previously applied@xcite to the transport experiments in zero field ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the starting point for understanding the transport experiments is to note that eq .",
    "( [ heff - etagauge ] ) is a random - field xy model .",
    "the energy @xmath36 consists of the competition between the tunneling energy , which is minimized by a spatially varying superfluid phase @xmath7 over the disorder correlation length @xmath37 , and the superfluid stiffness , which is minimized by a uniform superfluid phase . for the bilayer ,",
    "the disorder correlation length is much shorter than the clean tunneling length : @xmath38 . in this regime",
    ", the superfluid stiffness dominates at short scales , up to the imry - ma or pinning length @xmath39 where the two energies balance .",
    "we estimate@xcite that @xmath40 10  100 @xmath41 m and @xmath42 20  100 mk in experiments . beyond this scale ,",
    "the phase rotates to take advantage of the tunneling energy .",
    "therefore , we can interpret the ground state as consisting of randomly polarized domains of size @xmath43 .",
    "the total tunneling current in each domain is zero in the ground state because the random field @xmath11 gives a current density @xmath44 [ eq .  ] of random sign within each domain of constant @xmath7",
    "however , if we drive the system by injecting currents phase twists enter from the contacts , leading to configurations with non - zero tunneling currents . injected counterflow current decays into the bulk _ via _ tunneling , _ i.e. _ , recombination of excitons .",
    "this tunneling current is supplied by rotating the phase of the domains near the contacts , leaving domains in the bulk in their ground state .",
    "the maximum coherent tunneling current that can be supported by each domain is given by@xcite : @xmath45 if all the domains near the contact are rotated to supply this maximum tunneling , then we see a uniform tunneling current @xmath44 until all the injected counterflow current has decayed by tunneling",
    ". then both the tunneling and counterflow currents are zero in the bulk .",
    "this can be described by the continuity equation for the current : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the size of the domain and @xmath48 is the tunneling current across the layers in the domain .",
    "the sign of @xmath48 is determined by what is necessary to reduce the counterflow current . in a one - dimensional geometry , this gives a counterflow current profile that decays linearly into the bulk from the edge .",
    "for instance , for an injected current of @xmath49 at @xmath50 , the current profile in the @xmath51-direction is @xmath52 where the point @xmath53 marks the boundary of the region from the sample edge where coherent tunneling occurs to reduce the counterflow current .",
    "this current profile is a critical state similar to the bean critical state in superconductors  @xcite . in this state",
    ", there is a region near the contact over which the density gradient in the soliton train ( introduced by the injected current ) balances the pinning force arising from the tunneling .",
    "we now consider the response of the disordered system to an in - plane field at zero temperature .",
    "we will see that the disordered system has a different diamagnetic response from the clean system . it does not have a commensurate - incommensurate transition controlled by an intrinsic lengthscale @xmath22",
    "[ see eq .  ] . instead",
    ", we find a saturation phenomenon for the diamagnetic moment at a field @xmath54 [ see eq .  ] controlled by the properties [ eq .   and ] of the phase - polarized domains , _",
    "i.e. _ , the disorder - pinning of the applied flux .",
    "this is followed by a depinning of the polarized domains and a strong suppression of the diamagnetic response at a higher field @xmath55 [ eq .  ]",
    "controlled by the disorder correlation length @xmath37 .",
    "such behavior is similar to that of the mixed - state of a superconductor , but very different from that previously predicted for exciton condensates .",
    "we require the response of the superfluid phase @xmath7 to an in - plane field @xmath4 , corresponding to a non - zero @xmath56 in eq .  .",
    "to obtain this , we note that eq .   for the phase @xmath7 does not depend on the in - plane field .",
    "alternatively , we can see that the superfluid phase is coupled to the field in eq . as an integral over @xmath57 , which can be written as a boundary term for @xmath7 .",
    "thus the current distribution in a field can be related to that in zero field with shifted boundary conditions .",
    "this observation allows us to apply the critical - state model@xcite in zero field , as reviewed above , to calculate the current profile in non - zero field .    for definiteness",
    ", we consider a rectangular sample with dimensions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with the in - plane field in the @xmath60-direction .",

    "we can decompose @xmath15 into paramagnetic and diamagnetic parts as in eq .  .",
    "the paramagnetic part , @xmath65 , obeys the boundary condition @xmath66 . since the phase @xmath7 obeys the same equation , eq .",

    "and so @xmath71 decays linearly in space from @xmath69 at the edge to zero . in other words , the profile of the paramagnetic current @xmath71 near the @xmath50 edge",
    "is given by eq .   with @xmath77 .",
    "the distance @xmath78 which gives the width of the region where coherent tunneling occurs is determined by the distance where the total counterflow current vanishes : @xmath79 .",

    "there is no paramagnetic contribution to the counterflow current .",
    "this current profile is similar to the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] .",
    "a diamagnetic counterflow is generated by the in - plane field in the bulk of the bilayer .",

    "the width of this tunneling region is determined by the size of the domain @xmath43 and the coherent tunneling current that each could support @xmath48 .",

    "the size of the tunneling region increases with the in - plane field , as can be seen from eq .  :",
    "this should be contrasted with the decay length @xmath22 for the commensurate state of the clean model which is an intrinsic scale that does not vary with the field .    as the parallel field @xmath4 is increased , the diamagnetic current in the bulk increases linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "this requires a wider tunneling region so that all the current can decay to zero at the edge .",
    "so , the tunneling region increasingly penetrates the bulk .",
    "this penetration is complete when the width of the region , @xmath82 , reaches @xmath84 .",
    "this saturation occurs when the field reaches a critical field of @xmath85 beyond this critical field , all the phase domains in the sample take part in coherent tunneling with a constant magnitude for the tunneling current density @xmath44 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : critcprofs ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the counterflow current , therefore , rises linearly from zero from either edge , reaching a maximum at the center of the sample .",
    "this saturated current profile stays the same for fields higher than @xmath54 .",
    "note that , whereas the critical field @xmath31 in the clean limit is a microscopic parameter independent of sample geometry , @xmath54 is proportional to the length of the sample in a disordered system .",
    "we have tested the critical - state model by comparing it with numerical minimization of the energy [ eq .  ] for a one - dimensional lattice model . to do this",
    "we add a dissipative dynamical term @xmath86 to the right - hand side of eq .   and",

    "[ fig : critcprofs ] , the fraction of the sample with the full diamagnetic current @xmath91 is continuously reduced as @xmath4 ( and hence @xmath92 ) increases . in fact , the total moment saturates at the critical field @xmath54 to the value of @xmath93 the analysis above applies if the field and supercurrents are sufficiently small that their presence does not modify the pinning length @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the supercurrents do not depin the vortices .",

    "( [ heff - thetagauge ] ) does not affect the tunneling energy . for larger fields",
    "however , the tunnel currents will oscillate within each correlation area , rapidly suppressing the net tunneling at larger scales .",
    "the current @xmath95 , which is @xmath91 at the boundary , will then be approximately uniform , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be small at long wavelengths .",
    "thus we expect the susceptibility to fall quickly for fields beyond @xmath96 this can be regarded as a depinning field where the phase is no longer pinned by the random field but is determined by the diamagnetic wavevector @xmath92 .",
    "a corresponding suppression@xcite of the current in interlayer tunneling experiments is expected , and observed , at such fields . since @xmath97 for experimental samples with @xmath98 1 mm , the saturation at @xmath54 occurs before this suppression at @xmath99 .",
    "note that in the lattice model discussed above , the disorder is uncorrelated between sites , so that the numerical simulations do not capture the depinning effect at @xmath99 .",

    "( [ eq : creepform ] ) will not be exactly the resistivity in the dissipative regime .",

    "in contrast , here we have obtained this form from the motion of phase - polarized domains , which corresponds to a large - scale collective motion of the merons .",
    "however , we expect the energy barriers for vortex motion in two dimensions to be the superfluid stiffness up to logarithmic factors , so long as the possibility of a vortex glass is excluded .",

    "we now turn to the feasibility of measuring the diamagnetic response of a bilayer at low temperatures . to do this",
    ", we compare the maximum moment @xmath132 [ eq .  ] with the scale of the perpendicular moment , @xmath133 , for an electron gas in the integer quantum hall regime with cyclotron energy @xmath134 50k in this system . using our previous estimates",

    "note that the interlayer tunneling can be increased by many orders of magnitude compared with the current samples by reducing the tunnel barrier .",
    "increasing the tunneling strength reduces the domain size @xmath43 . also",
    ", the narrower barriers possible with stronger tunneling allow a larger @xmath131 .",
    "our approach holds up to the point where the domain size @xmath43 reaches the disorder lengthscale , @xmath139 , and the maximum field @xmath54 just reaches the depinning field @xmath99 . at this point",
    ", we obtain a significant magnetic moment @xmath140 .",
    "thus the diamagnetism of the exciton superfluid should be evident in samples with strong interlayer tunneling .",
    "although in the weak - tunneling samples the moments are small , the pinning and dynamics of the in - plane flux can still be probed in transport experiments .",
    "one consequence of the pinning picture is that the critical current in a tunneling experiment should not be affected by in - plane fields smaller than @xmath99 , in contrast to the clean limit where the critical current is suppressed at fields@xcite @xmath141 .",
    "this is because in the pinning picture it is the _ gradients _ of the in - plane flux density which drive the flux through the disorder , and while the injected currents in the tunneling geometry impose such gradients , a uniform in - plane field does not",
    ". it would also be possible to study the dynamics of the in - plane flux in tunneling experiments .",
    "an interlayer voltage at one end of the sample introduces in - plane flux at a given rate , and measuring the interlayer voltages and currents reveals the subsequent motion@xcite of this flux .",
    "the logarithmic relaxation of the flux - creep regime can lead to hysteresis , which is seen in tunneling experiments  @xcite .",
    "an interesting extension of our work would be to consider samples in the corbino disk geometry .",
    "in such a geometry , a radial magnetic field could induce circulating counterflow supercurrents , similar to the induction of linear counterflow supercurrents by an in - plane field in the open geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] . in the open geometry",
    ", tunneling is necessary to close the current loop , which we have seen gives rise to a maximum magnetic moment at the field @xmath54 . in a corbino disk , tunneling",
    "is not needed to close a circulating current loop , so there may be no saturation effect at @xmath54 and the full magnetic response may persist up to @xmath99",
    ". however , there will still be radial variations in the densities of applied flux and diamagnetic current , and maintaining the diamagnetic current loop requires that these variations are pinned .",
    "thus it seems likely that , even in this geometry , there is a maximum magnetic moment determined by the sample dimensions and a pinning length .",
    "the relevant pinning length , however , may be determined by parameters other than the tunneling strength .",
    "in summary , we have considered the diamagnetic response of a bilayer exciton superfluid to an in - plane magnetic field , in the presence of in - plane vortices nucleated by charge disorder .",
    "we argue that at low temperatures , changes in the in - plane magnetic field induce circulating diamagnetic currents and hence persistent diamagnetic moments .",
    "the maximum moments which can be induced are determined by the pinning of the in - plane flux by the disorder , which involves a characteristic lengthscale related to the tunneling . at finite temperatures , thermal motion of the in - plane flux",
    "will lead to transport resistivities and cause the diamagnetic moments to decay . in current samples , we find that the maximum moments are small , but samples with stronger tunneling could allow persistent exciton supercurrents to be probed by torque magnetometry .",
    "such experiments would be analogous to the torsional oscillator experiments that are the definitive measure of superfluid fraction in helium .",
    "finally , we note that very strong tunneling , or very large stiffness , may even be able to prevent the disorder nucleating vortices@xcite , recovering the clean limit in which the magnetic response is also expected to be measurable@xcite . in this case",
    "the phase diagram of the bilayer would then closely parallel that of a type - ii superconductor , with both a mixed state ( as described here ) and a clean state , experimentally distinguishable by the presence of hysteresis ."
