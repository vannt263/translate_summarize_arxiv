    "a large number of periodic and quasiperiodic phases have been observed in the ternary al - pd - mn system @xcite .",
    "apart from the stable icosahedral phase ( i - phase ) there is a stable decagonal phase ( d - phase ) with 1.2  nm periodicity and a metastable d - phase with 1.6  nm periodicity , found by @xcite .",
    "the orthorhombic @xmath3-approximants ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of the i - phase form a class of closely related periodic phases and can be viewed as approximants of this 1.6  nm d - phase , as they have the following features in common with the d - phase :    1 .",
    "they are arrangements of columns of mackay - type clusters and intermediary atoms @xcite .",
    "these clusters consist of about 52 atoms , placed on concentric shells of icosahedral symmetry as shown for the @xmath1-phase by @xcite .",
    "2 .   the columns are in registry , i.e.  the compounds also have a layer structure .",
    "the clusters contain about 80% of the atoms .",
    "therefore a coarsened structural description makes sense where only the projections of the cluster columns along the column lines are marked .",
    "they lead to two - dimensional tilings , which are characteristic for the respective approximant phase .",
    "the vertices of the tiles correspond to the projections of the cluster columns .",
    "the tilings contain flattend hexagons , which for the @xmath0-phase are aligned parallel ( figure  [ fig : tilings](a ) ) , for the @xmath1-phase are staggered in two orientations ( figure  [ fig : tilings](b ) ) . in the @xmath1-phase isolated combinations of a pentagon and a banana - shaped nonagon ( figure  [ fig : tilings](c ) )",
    "are observed , along which the orientation of the hexagons is inverted and which are able to move by flips .",
    "@xcite therefore have termed them _ phason - lines _ , following the notation of related defects in quasicrystals . in bending experiments these phason - lines order into",
    "periodically aligned _ phason - planes _ with @xmath4 rows of hexagons in between ( figure  [ fig : tilings](d ) and ( e ) ) , forming periodic superstructures . here we propose to name these phases @xmath5- , @xmath6- , @xmath7 , @xmath8-phases , the reason for the index - shift being given later .",
    "most observed is the @xmath5-phase , which is also known as @xmath9-phase @xcite .",

    "two hexagon rows are marked grey .",
    "( c )  the hexagons h occur in two different orientations .",
    "the other tiles , the pentagon p and the nonagon n can only be observed in combination , called phason - line .",
    "the edge length of the tiles is : @xmath10  nm .",
    "( d )  in the @xmath11-phase there is one row of hexagons between two phason - lines , also called phason - planes .",
    "( e )  in the @xmath12-phase there are two rows of hexagons between neighbouring phason - planes .",
    "the arrangement of hexagons is flipped at a phason - line as highlighted in the figure .",
    "[ fig : tilings],width=604 ]    the @xmath2-phases can be considered striped defect lattices .",
    "the stripes , which are the phason - planes , can bend and move , varying their distances @xcite . @xcite",
    "have observed dislocations in the stripe pattern and have called them _",
    "metadislocations_. they are the characteristic textures of partial dislocations in the basic tiling .    in this article",
    "we are developing a simplified projection formalism to describe all the @xmath3-phases .",
    "it is derived from the hyperspace method of the quasiperiodic phases . as a consequence",
    ", phasonic degrees of freedom can exist in the @xmath3-phases which allow movements of the phason - planes .",
    "we determine those hyperlattice burgers vectors which label the partial dislocations of lowest energies and relate them to the burgers vectors of the metadislocations .",
    "indeed , these are the only ones which are observed . the charming feature of our formalism is that the simplest model is working in three space so that all steps are easily imaginable .",
    "the atomic positions for a quasicrystal can be described by decorating the lattice points of a periodic hypercrystal with atomic surfaces and marking the points where these are intersected by a planar cut space ( cut - method ) .",
    "an equivalent method is the strip - method @xcite .",
    "approximants are constructed by using inclined cut spaces @xcite . for a detailed explanation see also @xcite .      a six - dimensional hyperspace with orthogonal basis vectors @xmath13 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 of length @xmath15  nm was used by @xcite to model the i - phase of al - pd - mn .",
    "the hyperspace was decorated with three different atomic surfaces positioned on different nodes in a face - centred lattice , namely    * even nodes : n@xmath16 , * odd nodes : n@xmath17 , * even body - centre nodes : bc@xmath18 .",
    "the cut space is spanned by three vectors , whose components in the above basis are ( @xmath19 is the golden mean ) : @xmath20    @xcite applied the cut - method for the three - dimensional atomistic description of the phases @xmath0 and @xmath1 as approximants of the icosahedral phase . in order to position each single atom correctly , they had to modify the atomic surfaces slightly .",
    "it turned out that the centre volumes of the n@xmath21 atomic surfaces , which lie again on a six - dimensional face - centred lattice , correspond to the cluster centre atoms . this way the model is reduced to three - dimensional tilings for the cluster positions only .    for the @xmath1-phase beraha et al .",
    "have derived the vectors that span a unit cell of the inclined cut space .",
    "we add the vectors for the inclined cut spaces of the @xmath0-phase and the @xmath2-phases :    @xmath22    the @xmath23-vector is the same for all the phases , because it marks the periodicity in the tenfold direction of the d - phase , which coincides with the column line of the mackay - type clusters . by projecting in direction of @xmath23 , two - dimensional tilings like those in figure  [ fig : tilings ] can be obtained .",
    "the edge length of the tiles is @xmath24  nm . it can be calculated by projecting all connection vectors @xmath25 of neighbouring n@xmath21-sites onto the tiling plane .",
    "the shortest projections have length @xmath26 .    since the six vectors @xmath27 , @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 lie in a three - dimensional subspace of the six - dimensional hyperspace , a description of the tilings in a three - dimensional hyperspace is possible by the cut - method .",
    "the model can be simplified by using a simple cubic lattice in three - space , as will be shown in detail in section [ sec : threedimensional ] .",
    "we can arrive at this conclusion directly after substituting the tiling of hexagons , pentagons and nonagons by a tiling of rhombs .",
    "the new tiles are the thin and thick penrose rhombs which in general are spanned by the vectors of a regular five - star .",
    "the interior angles of the tiles are multiples of @xmath33 .",
    "-phase  ( a ) and the @xmath1-phase  ( b ) are built only with the thick rhombs , while for the @xmath5-phase  ( c ) and the @xmath6-phase  ( d ) also the thin rhombs are needed . between two phason - planes in the @xmath2-phase there are @xmath34 rows of alternating thick rhombs ( marked grey ) .",
    "the new tiles are shown in  ( e ) .",
    "the edge length of the tiles is : @xmath35  nm . [ fig : tilings2],width=604 ]    as shown in figure  [ fig : tilings2 ] , a hexagon of the original tiling is substituted by a thick rhomb , and a nonagon / pentagon combination is substituted by a combination of a thin and a thick rhomb.- and @xmath1-phase and small hexagons for the phason - lines .",
    "however no description in hyperspace was presented , explaining the arrangement of the tiles . ]",
    "therefore we will refer to the thin rhombs as phason - lines .",
    "a row of hexagons in staggered orientation is substituted by a row of alternating thick rhombs , and a phason - plane is substituted by a combination of a row of alternating thick rhombs and a row of thin rhombs , which again will be called phason - plane .",
    "hence the number of rows of thick rhombs between two phason - planes in the new tiling for the @xmath2-phase is exactly @xmath34 .",
    "thus the tilings for the column positions of the @xmath3-phases emerge as approximants of the penrose tiling .",
    "however , only rhombs of three orientations show up .",
    "to span these only three prongs of the five - star are required .",
    "this is another argument why we can apply a projection formalism in a three - dimensional hyperspace which was mentioned above and is elaborated further below .    to model the lattices of all @xmath3-phases , their phasonic degrees of freedom and their metadislocations we found it suitable to resort to a modified cut and projection method . to our knowledge",
    "it has not been applied yet in the literature .",
    "it makes use of _ atomic hypervolumes _ and requires a short section .",
    "the method will be explained by the example of the well known one - dimensional fibonacci - chain : the two - dimensional hyperspace is partitioned into equal unit cells , called atomic volumes ( in general atomic hypervolumes ) as shown in figure  [ fig : fibonacci](a ) . and the unit cells as atomic volumes . ] for the construction of an approximant ,",
    "two different lines are needed : the cut line @xmath36 ( in general cut plane or cut space ) and the projection line @xmath37 ( in general projection plane or projection space , also named physical space ) .",
    "those cells that are cut by @xmath36 are selected ( marked grey ) .",
    "the middle point of those cells is projected onto the projection line .",
    "the projection leads to two different intervals on @xmath37 , either a small one ( @xmath38 ) , when the neighbouring selected cells meet vertically , or a large one ( @xmath39 ) , when they meet horizontally , forming the tiles of the fibonacci - chain .",
    "the orientation of @xmath37 determines the shape of the tiles . in the example of the fibonacci - chain",
    ", it determines the ratio of @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast , the orientation of @xmath36 fixes the arrangement of the tiles . since different approximants of the same quasiperiodic phase",
    "are built from the same tiles , but with different arrangement of the tiles , the only difference in the construction is the varying orientation of @xmath36 .",
    "a rational slope of the cut line leads to a periodic tiling , while an irrational slope generates a quasiperiodic tiling .",
    "the special case of @xmath37 and @xmath36 being identical is the original cut - method as mentioned above .    a geometrical restriction on the orientation of @xmath36 is imposed by the fact , that projected tiles must not overlap . in the example of the fibonacci - chain this means , that the slope of @xmath36 must be positive . for a counterexample when it is not fulfilled see figure  [ fig : fibonacci ] ( b ) . with this method",
    "we now construct the tilings of the cluster projections .     and a projection line @xmath37 are required ( see text ) .",

    "the atomic surfaces are the projections of the unit cells on the orthogonal complement of @xmath36 . because we will deal with cut spaces with spatially varying orientation in this paper",
    ", we would need a varying shape of the atomic surfaces as well .",
    "the method of atomic hypervolumes avoids these problems , as the atomic hypervolumes themselves do not vary .",
    "because the rhombic tilings for the @xmath3-phases are approximants of the penrose tiling they can be described in a five - dimensional hyperspace with basis @xmath40 , the hyper - cubic lattice @xmath41 and the unit cells as atomic hypervolumes .",
    "the projection plane of the penrose tiling is spanned by the vectors @xmath42 and the projection matrix is obtained by writing these vectors normalised in the rows : @xmath43 the projections @xmath44 of the five - dimensional basis vectors give a regular five - star as drawn in figure  [ fig : fivestar](a ) .",
    "the rhomb tiles are the projection of two - dimensional faces of the five - dimensional unit cells .",

    "if , for example in the fibonacci - chain , the cut line of the approximant has slope 0 , a local excitation always creates regions of the cut line having positive as well as negative slope .",
    "the regions of negative slope lead to overlapping tiles , as shown in figure  [ fig : fibonacci](b ) earlier . in such a case , accordingly , local displacements of the cut plane are geometrically not allowed and the phasonic degree of freedom is termed _ not excitable_.    with regard to the approximants of the 1.6  nm d-(al - pd - mn ) in the five - dimensional model , the phasonic degrees of freedom of the @xmath3-phases are not excitable in the directions of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "so for a full description of these phases the three - dimensional hyperspace with basis @xmath92 and only one phasonic degree of freedom is sufficient .    this last phasonic degree of freedom is excitable in the @xmath2-phases , leading to new phenomena .",

    "no phasonic degrees of freedom are excitable , while in the @xmath2-phases there is exactly one excitable phasonic degree of freedom , which is connected to the bending of the phason - planes .",

    "it is possible that phasonic degrees of freedom and dislocations with phasonic components also occur in various other complex metallic alloys , that have connections to quasiperiodic phases .",
