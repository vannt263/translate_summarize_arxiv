    "one of recent important developments in study of the ads / cft correspondence is the duality between gluon scattering amplitudes in @xmath5 super yang - mills theory and the area of the minimal surface in ads spacetime surrounded by the closed light - like wilson loops . from the duality one can compute the gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling . in the case of the 4-point amplitude , alday and",
    "maldacena @xcite showed that the dimensionally regularized area agrees with the formula conjectured by bern , dixon and smirnov ( bds ) @xcite based on the perturbative analysis .",
    "see @xcite for further developments .",
    "the duality between gluon scattering amplitudes and wilson loops is shown to hold at weak coupling @xcite , which implies that the amplitude is invariant under dual conformal symmetry in momentum space @xcite . in superstring theory ,",
    "this symmetry is interpreted as the symmetry of ads spacetime and invariance of the action under the combination of bosonic and fermionic t - duality@xcite .",
    "the anomalous conformal ward identity constrains the structure of the 4 and 5-point amplitudes , which agrees with the bds formula .",
    "but for higher @xmath1-point amplitudes there arises some ambiguities in the finite remainder part of the amplitude which can be written in terms of the conformal invariant cross - ratio of the external gluon momenta @xcite .",
    "in fact , the explicit calculations of the two - loop 6-point gluon scattering amplitude and the hexagon wilson loop @xcite shows that they agree with each other but differ from the bds formula by finite term , which depends on three independent cross - ratios of the mandelstam variables .",
    "this discrepancy from the bds ansatz was also observed at strong coupling by studying zigzag rectangular @xcite and a wavy circular wilson lines @xcite .",
    "but the precise evaluation of the finite deviation from the bds formula is difficult to obtain since the exact solution of the minimal surface for higher - point amplitudes is not yet known .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we constructed the minimal surfaces corresponding to the 4 , 6 and 8 point amplitudes numerically and evaluate the area in the radial cut - off regularization .",
    "the light - like segments of the boundary is the same as the cut and glue type surface @xcite .",
    "we showed that the numerical solutions differ from the cut and glue type surface and the area is consistent with the ir behavior of the amplitude . in this paper",
    "we will study the area of the discretized surfaces for the 6 and 8-point amplitudes by applying conformal transformation and compare the area to the conjectured bds formula numerically .",
    "this analysis gives a test of the duality between gluon scattering amplitudes and the wilson loops at strong coupling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review the radial cut - off regularization and a numerical approach to the construction of the minimal surface . in section 3 , we apply the conformal transformation to the 4-point amplitudes and compare it with the exact formula of the area in the radial cut - off regularization .",
