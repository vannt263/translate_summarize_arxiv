    "it is not uncommon to find a particularly radio luminous active galactic nucleus ( agn ) classified as a broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) , a quasar , _ and a @xcite class ii object ( an fr ii s radio emission is lobe - dominated and edge - brightened , whereas an fr i is jet - dominated and edge - darkened ) .",
    "generally , an agn s classification can depend on many factors such as when and in what part of the spectrum it was first discovered , which particular study it is being used in , and the source of the data . moving beyond an often blurred and overlapping system of identification into one based on more quantitative parameters could allow a more continuous classification scheme that is easier to apply to the large samples that continue to become available with large area surveys , e.g. , in the radio ( vla s first survey ) , infrared ( 2mass ) , optical ( sdss ) , and x - ray ( rosat ) bands .",
    "the agn in these large samples can now be classified based on measured quantities in a statistical fashion that is inherently more continuous than the discrete nomenclature generally used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_    all agn are believed to be powered by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , and show strong emission and variability in all wavebands from the radio to x - ray regimes .",
    "although not a fundamental physical parameter , the inclination of the bh / accretion disk system to our line of sight is an observational parameter that , according to accepted unification models , is responsible for the presence or absence of permitted broad lines ( bl ) ( in type 1 and type 2 agn , respectively ) in optical spectra due to toroidal obscuration by gas and dust when viewed at large inclination angles .",
    "typically we assume that bl agn have lower inclinations to our line of sight and we are looking down onto the bl region ( blr ) clouds that lie just outside the immediate vicinity of the bh and accretion disk system .",
    "an important fundamental parameter is black hole mass ( m@xmath4 ) , which has been determined directly through various methods including h@xmath10o - maser observations and reverberation mapping ( rm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rm becomes a powerful tool when applied to large spectroscopic samples in that the scaling relations derived from rm analysis allow single epoch ( single spectra ) m@xmath4 determinations for bl agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another important parameter , the eddington ratio , is the ratio of the bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath11 ) to the eddington luminosity ( l@xmath12 @xmath13 m@xmath14 ) .",
    "determination of the true l@xmath11 gives a measure of the accretion rate and requires a full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that spans from radio to x - ray emission and beyond for most agn .",
    "agn that have an observed sed that spans the entire spectrum provide normalization relations so that one can use a single continuum measurement in the optical or x - ray bands to stand in as a reasonable proxy for l@xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of radio - loudness is another means by which to classify agn , and is based on the amount of radio emission in the form of core emission , jets and/or lobes that can be positively associated with the central engine and accretion phenomenon .",
    "there are two main characterizations of the radio - loudness of agn .",
    "the first is to set a dividing line between radio - loud ( rl ) and radio - quiet ( rq ) based on the @xmath5 parameter defined as the ratio of the monochromatic 5 ghz radio luminosity to the 4400   optical luminosity ( @xmath15l@xmath16/@xmath17l@xmath18 ) . by convention , rl agn have @xmath19 10 and rq agn have @xmath20 10 @xcite .",
    "the second way to characterize the degree of radio - loudness is by using the radio luminosity alone .",
    "@xcite originally found a transition from the fr i type radio morphology to the fr ii type corresponding to a luminosity of 10@xmath21 watts hz@xmath22 at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "while this luminosity is not a rl / rq dividing line , the distribution in the radio luminosity plane shows that most fr is have luminosities below this dividing line and fr iis have luminosities above .",
    "however it is well established that many fr is are rl when following the classic @xmath5 convention .",
    "therefore a lower luminosity dividing line has occasionally been used as an alternate way to classify agn as either rl or rq ; e.g. , @xcite specify 10@xmath23 watts hz@xmath22 to be this division for first data at 1.4 ghz .    a quasar radio dichotomy has been postulated because only 5% ",
    "10% of all agn are rl according to the @xmath19 10 criterion @xcite .",
    "this has led to claims that there is a bimodal distribution in the @xmath5 parameter for high optical luminosity , high redshift sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , where usually only the core radio emission is taken into account . while the rl agn are usually thought to be powered by the same phenomenon of matter accreting onto a smbh , it has been suggested that they may have a different accretion mode , e.g. , advection dominated accretion flow @xcite versus a standard thin disk , or that their bh s are more massive or spinning faster , or some combination of both ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "other models propose that powerful jets tap the spin energy of the bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so the accretion rate is nearly irrelevant .",
    "either case suggests that @xmath5 , although not a fundamental quantity , may be linked to one .",
    "very often the most extreme rl agn are fr ii types that have giant radio lobes that grow and extend from the host galaxy out to mpc scales while being fed by highly collimated jets .",
    "statistically , these agn are associated most often with giant elliptical galaxies that tend to have optical spectra with very broad balmer line ( h@xmath3 , h@xmath24 ) profiles with a large full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) , typically @xmath1 8000 km s@xmath22 @xcite . in studies of high redshift , high luminosity agn , it has generally been thought that most rl agn have m@xmath25 m@xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this clearly manifests itself for most fr iis when determining m@xmath4 from single epoch measurements , since generically , m@xmath27 fwhm@xmath28l@xmath29 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown in studies by @xcite and @xcite that there is a strong correlation between radio - loudness and eddington ratio , where agn with very low accretion rates ( corresponding to @xmath30 10@xmath31 l@xmath32l@xmath12 ) are almost exclusively all rl based on the @xmath5 parameter , and a clear trend can be seen of decreasing radio - loudness with increasing l@xmath32l@xmath12 .",
    "further , @xcite find two separate populations of agn in the @xmath5 vs l@xmath32l@xmath12 plane , where the upper population consists of fr is , blrgs and rl quasars hosted by giant elliptical galaxies , and the lower population are mostly seyfert and low ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) types hosted by spiral galaxies .",
    "while these studies do show a dependence of radio - loudness on accretion rate , they do not exclude the possibility that there may be other factors that contribute to the generation of strong radio emission , such as accretion modes which are directly related to the amount of matter in the accretion disk , or the spin of the smbh .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , we investigated these issues with the low - redshift sample of broad line agn from greene & ho ( 2007 ) , which was not selected on the basis of any radio property .",
    "we found no clear gap between rl and rq agn , and provided evidence for a significant radio - intermediate population in the local universe . using the above definition",
    ", we found that 4.7% of the agn in a flux - limited subsample were radio loud ( @xmath19 10 ) .",
    "we also found evidence that the radio - loud fraction ( rlf ) decreases with eddington ratio , in agreement with the above findings .",
    "finally , we found a significant number of rl agn with m@xmath33 m@xmath26 , which indicates that rl agn are not a product of only the most massive black holes in the universe .    in this paper , we reexamine our sample to study the extended radio emission ( @xmath1 4@xmath2 from the optical agn ) .",
    "we investigate the fr i / fr ii luminosity break and its relation to the claimed bimodal distribution in radio loudness .",
    "we also identify a number of unusual radio morphologies for future detailed study .",
    "finally , we compare these new results to those in paper i , where only the core emission was taken into account when calculating l@xmath34 .",
    "as discussed in detail in paper i , we have taken the bl agn sample from @xcite , who calculated m@xmath4 and l@xmath11/l@xmath12 from the full width at half maximum of the broad h@xmath3 line ( fwhm@xmath35 ) and the luminosity of h@xmath3 ( l@xmath36 ) for 8434 bl agn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr4 ) .",
    "we performed a follow up search for these objects using the 2008 april version of the very large array s ( vla ) 1.4 ghz faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey database @xcite .",
    "the first survey operates at a frequency of 1.4 ghz , has an angular resolution of @xmath30 5@xmath2 and a limiting magnitude of 1 mjy .",
    "@xcite find that 90% of all sdss /",
    "first matched agn only show radio emission at , or close to , the optical source using a @xmath37 search radius .",
    "many of these ` core ' sources only appear to be compact or unresolved , meaning that detailed structure on scales @xmath0 5@xmath2 will not be resolved due to the modest angular resolution of the first survey .",
    "such unresolved cores could be arising from orientation effects , where the radio jet is closely aligned with our line of sight , or they could be fairly young radio sources whose emission has not had time to expand out to a significant distance from the host galaxy .",
    "therefore agn with unresolved features , whether fr i or fr ii type , will appear as core - only sources in this sample .",
    "this paper follows our earlier paper in which we used a 4@xmath2 search radius to identify radio sources associated with the optical agn in this sample and where we showed this leads to very few false radio detections with an optical counterpart .",
    "we find that of the 8434 objects , 846 have core radio sources inside this radius ( we note that this number is updated from paper i , where we found 832 objects using the 2003 april 11 version of the first catalogue ) . in the study of paper",
    "i , only the core radio emission was taken into account in order to compare that work with other studies ( mentioned above ) at higher redshift . in this work",
    ", we have first taken these agn with radio core emission and performed a search around a much wider , 60@xmath2 radius , to identify any extended emission ( at positions @xmath1 4@xmath2 from the optical agn ) that may be associated with them .",
    "the 60@xmath2 search radius was chosen due to the fact that the largest known fr iis are on the scale of a mpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and at the sample redshift limit of @xmath38 , a 60@xmath2 search radius corresponds to nearly 1 mpc in diameter .",
    "all extended sources were visually inspected in the sdss and first images to give us confidence that the radio emission is associated .",
    "this does not mean that any clearly associated emission out past 60@xmath2 was not included , but that any associated emission out past 60@xmath2 was added to the total by hand after visual inspection of the first images .    in order to confirm the association of extended emission with the optical counterpart",
    "it is first necessary to make sure that the extended emission is not associated with another optical source in the field .",
    "the majority of cases where this takes place is when there is one core source within 4@xmath2 and a second radio source within 60@xmath2 , and where the second source is at the same position as another galaxy in the sdss image .",
    "therefore , any first sources found in the extended search with obvious optical counterparts in the sdss images were eliminated as possible extended source matches ( e.g. , sdss j094603.94 + 013923.6 is a bl agn misclassified as a star in sdss dr7 with a resolved spiral galaxy to the north that is the likely the source of the extended radio emission ) .",
    "the criteria used to confirm the association of the extended emission to the central optical source are illustrated in figure 1 , where the center of each image is the sdss optical agn position and the linear scale is given below it . in figure 1 , the sources a  e were all found to have core emission in paper i. in figure 1a ( top left ) we show the radio map of sdss j170013.70 + 400855.6 , which has a core - source with a nearby ( @xmath30 35 kpc projected distance ) knot of radio emission .",
    "there is also a possible lobe to the south - west that is below the flux limit of first .",
    "the association is based on the fact that the second emission region is close to the host galaxy and there is no optical source at or in the vicinity of the extended emission .",
    "the sources that had only two emission regions turned out to be the most numerous , and most were associated in this fashion . in figure",
    "1b we show the radio map of sdss j122011.89 + 020342.2 . here",
    "the association is based on the physical connection of several emission knots in the eastern jet to the core - source , and to a somewhat distant ( @xmath30 275 kpc projected distance ) faint lobe to the west . in figure 1c we show the radio map of sdss j132834.14 - 012917.6 .",
    "the association is based on the alignment of the very distant lobes ( both are @xmath30 500 kpc projected distance ) with the radio core emission along with clear trails of radio emission back to the core .",
    "there are several variations of this type , such as those having small bending angles ( usually less than @xmath30 15@xmath39 ) between the distant lobes , as shown in figure 1d . in figure 1e",
    "we show the radio map of sdss j091401.76 + 050750.6 .",
    "the association is based on the distant southern lobe ( @xmath30 400 kpc projected distance ) having a hot spot and lobe emission structure that points back to the core radio emission .",
    "this object may in fact have an additional lobe source to the north that is just outside of the image .",
    "however , this was not added to the total radio emission due to the fact that association at that distance is not guaranteed without the other criteria being met . in this case , the exclusion of this ` could - be lobe ' has very little effect on the conclusions due to the fact that it is very dim and the added emission would have been only 4% of the total . after visual inspection of all possible matches , we believe that there are very few false positives ( no more than 2 radio sources outside 4@xmath2 but inside 60@xmath2 that are not associated with the optical and radio core ) in this search when the objects with @xmath0 4@xmath2 separation between radio core emission and optical position are selected .",
    "we find 51 ( 6% of the original radio core emission sample and 0.6% of the total sample ) agn with extended emission that must be taken into account when calculating the total agn radio luminosity .",
    "of these 51 , we find a large range in the amount of extra emission that is picked up .",
    "some objects have a bright core and one dimmer lobe ( @xmath30 10%-50% in added radio emission ) , but we also find bright fr iis that have total integrated fluxes in the 1000 mjy range ( @xmath30 100%-600% in added radio emission ) . in order to characterize the amount of flux added due to extended emission , we show in figure 2 the fraction of extended flux added with respect to the initial core emission .",
    "about half of the sources lie in the 0.01  2 range , showing that nearly half of the sources add only a small fraction and up to twice of the core flux to the total , while the other half of the sample at least doubles the amount of flux added to the core , and the brightest source adds nearly 70 times more emission when compared to the core .",
    "we performed a second search using the entire optical sample to find possible fr ii types in which radio emission is only seen from lobes but there is weak ( below the 1 mjy flux limit of first ) or no core radio emission .",
    "the largest group found in this search has just one single radio source that is within 60@xmath2 .",
    "after visual inspection , usually there is another optical source matched to the extended radio source .",
    "even when there is no such alternative optical identification it is not possible to claim an association since there is no discernible jet to lobe connection or double lobe symmetry that would be excellent indications of association .",
    "most of these were rejected outright .",
    "we do however find an additional 12 objects ( not included in the 51 agn discussed above ) that have significant flux inside the 60@xmath2 search radius , but no core emission inside 4@xmath2 , that can be positively associated with the optical source .",
    "all of these were visually inspected to ensure that the radio emission was not associated with another optical source in the field and any clearly associated emission at distances @xmath1 60@xmath2 was taken into account and added by hand to the total radio flux .",
    "the criteria for establishing association for these objects is the alignment of two sources of emission out past 4@xmath2 with the optical source ( having no detected radio core ) , as shown in figure 1f for sdss j091519.56 + 563837.8 .",
    "we do note that any sources with radio lobes that have significant bending angles would not satisfy our alignment criteria , and some true associations may be excluded due to this effect .",
    "table 1 lists the sdss name of all 63 agn with extended radio emission along with their redshifts , projected physical extent and a ` by eye ' classification of the radio morphology based on first images .",
    "there are 22 sources with no previous radio identification in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) from other radio surveys and they therefore have no radio catalogue source name in table 1 .",
    "the radio classification column makes use of the ` giant radio galaxy ' ( grg ) classification , where the total projected linear extent exceeds 750 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the hybrid morphology radio sources ( hymors ) classification , where an fr ii lobe is seen on one side and an fr i jet is seen on the other side of the central source .",
    "we also classify x - shaped radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a possible reorientation of the jets has taken place to feed two individual sets of lobes , and the double - double morphology ( ddrg ) where interruption of the jets can cause two distinct sets of lobes to form throughout the lifetime of the agn , where the first and older set is at a larger distance than the second , younger pair ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "table 2 summarizes the morphologies of the extended sources ; the ` indeterminate ' designation is given to sources that were unresolved in the first images .",
    "we used the usual flux - luminosity relation with the same cosmology used by @xcite from @xcite ( h@xmath40 = 71 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath41 = 0.27 , and @xmath42 = 0.73 ) to calculate the total radio luminosity for each source . from these new data ,",
    "we update the @xmath5 values of the radio detected sample following paper i , including all associated extended emission .",
    "since the optical sample is the same , those properties are unchanged .",
    "we also break the sample into subsamples as in paper i. the ` detected sample ' consists of all agn with radio emission , and contains the core - only sources and the extended sources .",
    "the 63 extended sources are all rl ( i.e. , all have @xmath5 @xmath1 10 ) with the exception of one ( @xmath43 2.39 ) that is a face - on spiral galaxy ( sdss j220233.84 - 073225.0 ) with a modest l@xmath36 = 10@xmath44 ergs s@xmath22 , but a very low flux radio core ( @xmath45 2.36 mjy ) with an even fainter ` lobe ' ( f@xmath46 0.97 mjy ) offset by @xmath47 .",
    "we find that of the 793 remaining core - only sources , 383 are rl and 410 are rq , based on @xmath5 .",
    "the ` flux limited sample ' is explicitly defined in paper i and has 5485 total objects , using an upper limit of 1 mjy for all agn without radio detections as an optical flux cutoff . for the flux limited sample",
    "we find that 4.9% ( 270/5485 ) of the agn are rl compared to the 4.7% ( 259/5485 ) found in paper i when extended emission was not taken into account .    in order to determine how the extended sources differ from the rest of the sample we first compare the optical properties of the different subsets , namely the core - only sources , the extended sources and the total flux limited sample . in figure 3",
    "we show the fwhm distributions of the broad component of the h@xmath3 line ( fwhm@xmath36 ) for the extended , core - only , and non - radio detected sources in the flux limited sample , where all are normalized by the number in each group . the extended source distribution has an average fwhm of 5010 km s@xmath22 and the core - only sources have an average fwhm of 3550 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the peak of the distribution for the extended sources is at @xmath30 4500 km s@xmath22 and is shifted to higher fwhm values by about 2000 km s@xmath22 when compared to the core - only sources , that peak at @xmath30 2500 km s@xmath22 .",
    "both histograms have long tails that fall off at about the same rate toward higher fwhms .",
    "a k - s test between the core - only source distribution and the extended source distribution yields a probability value of 1.2 @xmath48 and a maximum difference of 0.35 , showing that it is extremely likely these two distributions are from different parent populations .",
    "a k - s test between the core - only sources and the non - radio detected sources yields a probability value of 0.077 and a maximum difference of 0.05 , meaning that the two have similar enough cumulative distribution functions that they may well be from the same parent population",
    ". visual inspection of the optical spectra shows that many of the extended agn have characteristically wide h@xmath3 profiles .",
    "this is consistent with the claim that most blrgs have intrinsically large m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this result is of course favored when calculating m@xmath4 based on single epoch m@xmath4 relations , where m@xmath49 fwhm@xmath50 , but a large m@xmath4 determination is not always guaranteed since this relation also depends on the optical luminosity of the central source ( m@xmath4 @xmath13 fwhm@xmath50l@xmath29 ) .",
    "the next optical property we compare between the radio types is the h@xmath3 luminosity ( @xmath13 l@xmath51 ) .",
    "the histogram in figure 4 shows the normalized distributions for the extended , core - only , and non - radio detected sources in the flux limited sample .",
    "we find that the extended source distribution is shifted to higher l@xmath36 by about 0.5 dex when compared to the core - only distribution , but overall the full distributions have similar peak values and show significant overlap .",
    "more precisely , the extended sources have an average l@xmath52 ergs s@xmath22 with a standard deviation of 0.60 dex , and the core - only sources have an average l@xmath53 ergs s@xmath22 with a standard deviation of 0.68 dex . a k - s test comparing the extended sources and the core - only sources yields a probability value of 1.4 @xmath54 and a maximum difference of 0.32 indicating that these two distributions may well be from different parent populations . in the context of m@xmath4 determinations , somewhat similar l@xmath36 distributions but systematically higher fwhm distributions should give larger m@xmath4 estimates for the extended agn when compared to the core - only sources .",
    "this turns out not to always be the case , since our extended sample has 36 sources with m@xmath55 m@xmath26 and 27 sources have m@xmath25 m@xmath26 .    the normalized distribution of 1.4 ghz radio luminosity ( l@xmath56 ) is shown in figure 5 for the flux limited sample .",
    "the peak of the extended sources is shifted to higher luminosities by a factor of 100 when compared to the core - only sources .",
    "this is not surprising given the high luminosities of fr ii lobes .",
    "looking at the region of overlap we find that there are few sources in these normalized distributions in the 10@xmath21 watts hz@xmath22 region , where the deficit of sources is at the fr",
    "i / fr ii transition luminosity originally found by @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "this is important for the log(@xmath5 ) histogram shown in figure 6 . in the top plot we show the core - only and extended source histograms normalized by the number in each group . the normalization is useful since there are many fewer extended radio sources , making this trend in the unnormalized histogram not as obvious .",
    "here we find what looks like two separate populations , or an apparent bimodality , in that the extended sources peak at log(@xmath5 ) @xmath57 2.5 whereas the core - only sources peak at about log(@xmath5 ) @xmath57 0.75 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that most of the extended sources have much higher radio luminosities compared to the core - only sources , but not much higher h@xmath3 luminosities , causing the shift of extended sources to higher log(@xmath5 ) values .",
    "this produces a bimodal distribution where the upper mode is comprised of rl objects ( @xmath19 10 ) populated by only the extended sources whose distribution drops below log(@xmath5 ) = 1 only for the one rq source mentioned above .",
    "the core - only distribution , however , goes well above and below the log(@xmath5 ) = 1 rl / rq dividing line .",
    "the bottom plot in figure 6 shows the histogram of two different populations from the detected sample ( core - only and extended sources ) based on a radio luminosity dividing line .",
    "the value of the radio luminosity dividing line was found by adjusting the break luminosity value until the lower histograms best matched the original core - only versus extended source histograms shown in the upper plot ( based on k - s statistics given below ) , and was found to be 10@xmath58 watts hz@xmath22 .",
    "it is interesting that the two sets of histograms are most similar when the break radio luminosity is nearly equal to that of the fr i / fr ii transition luminosity .",
    "it is clear that the agn with l@xmath59 watts hz@xmath22 have a log(@xmath5 ) distribution nearly identical to the core - only sources and the agn with l@xmath60 watts hz@xmath22 have a log(@xmath5 ) distribution nearly identical to the extended sources .",
    "a k - s test comparing the extended sources in the top plot and the fr ii - like distribution in the bottom plot yield a probability value of 1.0 and a maximum difference of 0.04 , showing that it is extremely unlikely that these two are from different parent populations .",
    "this is also found for the core - only and fr i - like distributions , which have a k - s probability value of 0.82 and a maximum difference of 0.03 .",
    "therefore , in order to move away from the ` by eye ' morphological classification schemes used to describe individual sources , we can in general use our extended sources as a proxy for the classic fr ii objects , and the core - only sources as a proxy for the fr i sources based on a break radio luminosity that is consistent with the previous fr i / fr ii dividing line . from this plot",
    "we also find that a log(@xmath5 ) value of @xmath57 1.75 is well suited to separate the fr is from the fr iis .",
    "the peak values of the @xmath5 histogram are consistent with the bimodal distributions found by the previous studies of @xcite and @xcite who find peaks at log(@xmath5 ) @xmath61 1 , and log(@xmath62 2 - 3 using only the radio core sources out to higher redshifts , which may possess complex ( extended ) structure , but which would be unresolvable at the higher redshifts probed in these samples . here",
    "we show that our two populations basically consist of the lower radio power fr is ( which could be young , unresolved or well aligned with the line - of - sight jets and/or lobes ) and the higher radio power fr iis , and that the @xmath5 bimodality seen here is likely a manifestation of the fr i / fr ii break originally found by @xcite .",
    "we updated the radio luminosities of the agn in our sample to determine the effects of the extended radio emission on our previous results in paper i. as might be expected , the additional flux in a small fraction ( @xmath308% ) of the radio - detected sample had little effect on the overall trends that we found between radio loudness and eddington ratio and/or black - hole mass ( see @xcite for the updated plots ) .",
    "we have taken the sdss bl agn sample from @xcite and performed a search for extended associated radio emission using the vla s first survey .",
    "we find that 846 of the objects ( 10% ) have core emission and 63 ( 0.8% ) have extended emission that must be taken into account when calculating the total radio luminosity and radio - loudness .",
    "we compare these results to @xcite and find that the trends in radio - loudness with other physical properties are largely unchanged , which is unsurprising as the detected sample was only modestly enlarged overall .",
    "the rlf as a function of l@xmath11/l@xmath12 and m@xmath4 are essentially the same , and we still find a modest trend of decreasing rlf with increasing log(l@xmath11/l@xmath12 ) , along with an increase of the rlf as m@xmath4 increases above @xmath63 m@xmath26 .",
    "we do note that about half of the extended rl agn do _ not _ have the most massive bhs ( m@xmath64 m@xmath26 ) , indicating that even extreme radio - loudness is not based solely on m@xmath4 , but must also be closely tied to other fundamental parameters such as black hole spin or accretion mode , although our data do not allow us to draw conclusions as to which , if either , of those theoretical paradigms for radio power is more likely to be correct .    with extended emission taken into account",
    ", we find evidence for a distinct population of rl agn comprised of the extended sources that is separate from the rl and rq core - only sources .",
    "we find that most of the extended agn in this low redshift sample are fr iis based on radio morphology and luminosity , using the same fr i / fr ii break luminosity defined by @xcite .",
    "we find a bimodal distribution in the @xmath5 parameter , but at a value above the classic rl / rq dividing line and propose that this is a manifestation of the fr i / fr ii break . in the previous high redshift studies mentioned above ,",
    "where only the ` core ' radio emission is used , the bimodality in @xmath5 may again be a manifestation of the fr i / fr ii transition , although what is considered to be core emission may in fact include jets and/or lobes ( or relatively young sources ) whose true radio structure is unresolved due to their extreme distances .",
    "we do note that for the sources with just two components , where one is the core source and the other is not at a large angular distance , the morphology is not easy to determine based on the resolution of the first survey .",
    "the distributions of optical luminosity for the h@xmath3 emission line ( figure 4 ) are more similar for both the core - only and extended sources , as well as the total sample , than are the distributions of radio luminosities ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this difference gives rise to the radio dichotomy seen when evaluating radio - loudness based on the @xmath5 parameter in this sample . from our sample",
    "we propose that a more interesting dividing line is at a log(@xmath5 ) value of @xmath30 1.75 instead of the classical log(@xmath65 .",
    "this higher break value for log(@xmath5 ) separates local broad - line agn into two distinct populations of undetected / core - only radio sources and extended radio sources in the first survey .",
    "the claims of bimodality between rl and rq agn have usually been based on the somewhat arbitrary log(@xmath5 ) @xmath66 1 criteria , and were heavily debated based on sample selection and inclusion / exclusion criteria ( see section 1 and references therein ) . while the dichotomy between rl and rq agn is called into question in the studies of @xcite and @xcite , the study by @xcite does find evidence for this dichotomy and further , postulates physical conditions that may be responsible for its existence . in this work",
    "we can clearly reproduce a dichotomy between the core - only sources , comprised of rq and weak / unresolved fr i type agn , against the most powerful fr i and fr ii type agn in our sample",
    ". such a distinction may have a more physical and theoretically compelling basis as opposed to being a distinction between rl and rq that is influenced strongly by observational constraints .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , all the agn in the upper population have extended emission and resolved complex morphologies whose bh / accretion disk system may have different or extreme physical properties when compared to the much more numerous undetected and core - only sources .",
    "the lower population ( core - only ) sources may then be made up of two types .",
    "the first type , where the radio emission originates from coronal emission on subparsec scales , as discussed in @xcite , could constitute the bulk of objects with log(@xmath5 ) @xmath0 1 .",
    "the second type could contain either unresolved young jets which emit on a scale of a few pc and/or weak jets with intrinsically weak radio emission and low kinetic jet power .",
    "this second type of object would still fit into our lower population while having 1.75 @xmath1 log(@xmath5 ) @xmath1 1 , thereby satisfying the classic paradigm that fr is tend to be rl based on log(@xmath5 ) @xmath1 1 .",
    "once the threshold of log(@xmath5 ) @xmath66 1.75 is crossed in figure 6 , there is a clear transition to the most radio powerful agn , with strong jets and bright extended emission ; these are plausibly a result of some difference in accretion mode , accretion rate , or bh spin in the central engine , whereby the efficiency of jet launching is greatly enhanced .",
