    "quantum cryptography is , in theory , unbreakable @xcite . the laws of quantum mechanics allow a sender of a message and a receiver , known as alice and bob respectively , to defeat an eavesdropper , eve , from accessing their communications . in the first quantum cryptography protocol discovered in 1984 by bennett and brassard ( bb84 )",
    "@xcite the idea is that alice encodes the logical bit values @xmath0 and @xmath1 on to four possible polarisation states of a photon , two in one basis such as horizontal and vertical polarisation ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ) and two in the conjugate basis , an equal superposition of the first basis .",
    "these photons could be encoded as having @xmath4 and @xmath5 polarisation ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ) .",
    "alice randomly sends one of them to bob who will then measure each of the photons in one of the two bases also randomly and independently from alice .",
    "after bob has made his measurement , alice reveals on a public channel the basis in which she sent her photon .",
    "bob then tells her whether or not he measured in the same basis .",
    "if he did not or he did not detect a photon , the bit is discarded but if the same basis was used they keep the bit and both parties should now hold the same result of the bit s value .",
    "the procedure is repeated until alice and bob hold a long string of bits .",
    "this is their sifted key and they should have perfectly correlated bit strings . if , however , a malicious eavesdropper , eve , was listening in an effort to obtain some of the key s information , she must make measurements on the states alice sends to bob . in doing this",
    "she will sometimes choose the wrong measurement and create errors in alice and bob s sifted key providing a signature of her presence to alice and bob when they come to a process called error correction and estimation .",
    "alice and bob sacrifice a subset of their key in order to do this and from their estimate of the error rate they may also calculate the maximum amount of information an eavesdropper could have obtained , a limit bounded by the laws of physics but as yet still unknown .",
    "bounds for specific attacks have been found ; these are usually attacks in which the eavesdropper measures each individual state alice sends to bob known as incoherent attacks .",
    "incoherent attacks on the bb84 protocol usually have the added restriction that they take into account information gained by the eavesdropper after public announcement of the basis but before error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "the optimal bound of an unrestricted attack using collective measurements of any size is still unknown",
    ". these may not be severe limits to the security of quantum cryptography at present because the technology needed to perform the simplest of controlled interactions on more than a few qubits is still at an early stage .    in reality however , there are added complications .",
    "all errors do not generally come from an eavesdropper alone .",
    "there will be noise in bob s detectors and in the quantum channel they use to setup the key as well as equipment misalignments .",
    "real implementations of quantum cryptography also have losses during transmission and they do not at present use single photon sources . instead ,",
    "attenuated laser pulses that may contain @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 or more photons are used as alice s signal source .",
    "practical implementation of quantum cryptography opens a security loophole and eve may adapt her attacks to take advantage of these facts .",
    "we give a simple derivation of incoherent eavesdropping attacks on these imperfect systems .",
    "we give a general argument that applies equally well to systems with high mean photon number pulses as we make no approximation .",
    "these results apply equally well to coherent states as to mixed photon number states with poissonian distribution .",
    "three attacks are analyzed in increasing order of technological sophistication of the eavesdropper .",
    "this is another important point : the practical quantum cryptography system need only prevent the most technologically powerful eavesdropper at the time key distribution takes place .",
    "this is unlike classical cryptography where a message may be stored until an eavesdropper has the technology with which to break it @xcite .",
    "provided alice and bob can calculate the maximum level of information eve could have obtained on their key from error estimation and by making a decision on how advanced her attack could have been in the worst case , alice and bob may be still able to distill a secret key on which eve has negligible information using a classical process called privacy amplification @xcite .",
    "finding these limits is important for the security of quantum cryptography which _ could _ take into account the technology of the eavesdropper and _ should _ include the settings and limits of alice and bob s equipment as well as fundamental physics .",
    "we give bounds on the maximum error rate alice and bob can tolerate for a realistic system with channel losses and laser pulses as the signal source for three incoherent attacks increasing in the technological power of the eavesdropper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing eavesdropping attacks where alice uses a single photon source to send key bits to bob in section  [ ais ] .",
    "we review two strategies : the simplest strategy that eve can employ , that of intercept - resend , a strategy whose implementation is well within the reach of current technology to that of the optimum incoherent attack for which the technology is not yet available .",
    "this latter attack involves storing quantum states for long times and well controlled interactions between a probe ( one or more qubits ) and the state the eavesdropper is trying to identify .",
    "these strategies provide the foundations for section  [ ars ] , eavesdropping on systems that use laser pulses and have a quantum channel with a transmission efficiency that may be less than unity .",
    "beam - splitter attacks are analyzed in detail using intercept - resend or optimal incoherent attacks .",
    "lastly , the photon - number splitting attack is analyzed , the most advanced strategy an eavesdropper could use and relies on performing unlimited efficient quantum non - demolition measurements : technology that is unlikely to be available for a long time . in sections  [ countermeasures ] and [ countermeasures2 ] we present some analysis on what alice and bob can do to counter eve s attacks .",
    "presented here are two attacks that an eavesdropper , eve , can employ depending on the sophistication of her technology on a perfect quantum cryptographic system using the bb84 protocol .",
    "the simplest , an intercept - resend strategy , could be implemented with equipment currently available whereas an attack using the optimal incoherent strategy would require an advance in technology .",
    "the latter attack belongs to class sometimes referred to as ` translucent attacks with entanglement ' @xcite .",
    "the idea with this kind of attack is to measure all or a proportion , @xmath9 , of the states alice sends to bob .",
    "if she chooses to measure only a fraction , @xmath9 , of the states , how she chooses which states to measure is dependent on how much information she wishes to obtain on the final message while making her presence as inconspicuous as possible .",
    "we will not consider how she chooses this fraction .",
    "presented here is an argument adapted from @xcite .",
    "eve makes her measurement on a state and given her result she makes the best guess as to what the _ logical bit value _ of the state was that alice intended bob to receive .",
    "eve then prepares one of the two states in the intermediate or breidbart basis depending on this guess and sends it on to bob . as we shall see , the two intermediate states belong to the same basis in which eve makes her measurement .    the four states alice can send to bob in the bb84 protocol are @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 eve does not have to guess the state with the best probability of being correct .",
    "alice and bob are trying to set up a key composed of 1s and 0s .",
    "it does not matter what state it is if eve is only trying to find out the values of the bits .",
    "alice must encode her states as in figure  [ logicalbb84 ] .",
    "note that the logical bit values for the two states in the same basis must be different otherwise public announcement of the basis would result in eve knowing everything about the key by simply passively monitoring this public conversation .",
    "eve s best chance of guessing the value of the bit with a simple , presently implementable measurement is to have two outcomes @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the probability of guessing the bit value correctly is @xmath16\\ ] ] where the two measurement operators have to satisfy @xmath17 . @xmath18 the identity matrix .",
    "the measurement operators are @xmath19 @xmath20 the two states @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a variable angle taken clockwise from @xmath3 . substituting the forms of @xmath14 and @xmath15 into equation  ( [ pcgeneral ] ) we get    ( 200,220 ) ( 50,100)(0,1)100    ( 50,100)(1,0)100    ( 50,100)(1,1)71    ( 50,100)(1,-1)71    ( 46,205)1    ( 46,218)@xmath3    ( 155,97)0    ( 165,97)@xmath2    ( 125,170)1    ( 130,180)@xmath6    ( 125,25)0    ( 130,15)@xmath7    @xmath26\\ ] ]    to find the measurement basis that gives the best chance of guessing the bit value correctly we maximize @xmath27 with respect to @xmath25 i.e. @xmath28=0\\ ] ] this gives @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath22 is orthogonal to @xmath21 and @xmath31 clockwise from @xmath3 .",
    "this is known as the intermediate or breidbart basis .",
    "substituting the value of @xmath25 into equation  ( [ bried ] ) gives @xmath32 .",
    "the intermediate states , are now given by @xmath33 @xmath34    we have now found the best basis in which to guess the value of the bits alice has encoded on to the quanta .",
    "alice and bob check for eve s presence by measuring the proportion of errors in their sifted key after the public announcement of the basis .",
    "it turns out that eve minimizes the disturbance to the sifted key by recording the value of her measurement , either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , then sending on to bob one of two states in the measurement basis either @xmath21 or @xmath22 i.e. if alice sends @xmath2 eve will make her measurement and get the result @xmath14 a proportion @xmath27 of the time and send bob @xmath21 .",
    "eve may also get the result @xmath15 a proportion @xmath35 of the time and guess the value of the state incorrectly . in this case",
    "she sends @xmath22 .",
    "eve causes an error in alice and bob s key when bob gets the result that @xmath3 was sent .",
    "this probability , @xmath36 , that eve causes a disturbance or error is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the outcome of bob s measurement .",
    "it is sufficient to analyze only this case only without the prior probability weightings of @xmath2 , @xmath3 etc .",
    "being sent if they are all equal .",
    "equation  ( [ dist ] ) reduces to @xmath39 @xmath40 if alice and bob see that a quarter of the bits in their sifted key are incorrect while error checking , this is a give away that eve was on the line . to mask her presence",
    "more carefully eve can measure a proportion of the states @xmath9 . in this case",
    "eve s probability of guessing the state correctly is @xmath41 where the last term on the right comes from the fact that eve can guess with an 50/50 chance the identity of the bit values she did not measure .",
    "the disturbance becomes @xmath42 combining these two expressions we get the probability of eve guessing the bit value correctly as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath43 note that @xmath44 as this is when @xmath45 .",
    "this strategy is reported from fuchs _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who proved it to be the optimum incoherent strategy an eavesdropper can use on an ideal quantum cryptography system using the bb84 protocol .",
    "the derivation given here was first given by cirac and gisin @xcite who found a simple symmetry argument that gives the same result .",
    "this attack is not available to an eavesdropper with present technology .",
    "the idea is to evolve a probe in some initial standard state , @xmath46 , into distinct probe states dependant on the state of alice s photon with which the probe is interacted with .",
    "the probes can then be stored until alice and bob announce the basis so that eve can increase her chance of distinguishing the probe ( and alice s state ) by choosing the best measurement for that particular basis .",
    "simultaneously eve wants to make the state she is sending to bob as much alike to the state alice sent to minimize the disturbance or error rate to the sifted key .",
    "we have the following interactions for the @xmath47-@xmath48 basis .",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 with similar interactions for the @xmath51-@xmath52 basis .",
    "the second kets in each tensor product on the right hand side after tracing out the probe states form the mixed state bob will receive .",
    "the first kets in each tensor product after tracing out bob s system will form the mixed state eve will keep .",
    "notice that the probe states @xmath53 are not normalized yet .",
    "these two interactions can be written more neatly in matrix form .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the matrix containing the ( un - normalized ) probe states .",
    "a similar expression can be constructed for the @xmath51-@xmath52 basis simply by changing subscripts .",
    "the probe state matrices in either basis have the form @xmath56 using the hadamard transform , @xmath57 , we can transform this matrix of probe states from one basis to the other .",
    "the transform is @xmath58 where @xmath57 is @xmath59 here we introduce the symmetry part of the argument .",
    "we are going to impose the conditions that + ( i ) all overlaps between probe states should be invariant under the change of labels @xmath60 .",
    "this means @xmath61 etc .",
    "+ ( ii ) overlaps between states in one basis should be the same as overlaps in the other basis .",
    "for example @xmath62 .",
    "+ going back to equation  ( [ thestates ] ) we need to normalize the probe states and enforce the unitary evolution condition ( that overlaps should be preserved ) .",
    "normalization requires @xmath63 @xmath64 from the symmetry requirement ( i ) and defining two parameters @xmath65 and @xmath36 we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 . from the unitary condition i.e. taking the overlaps of equations  ( [ thestates ] ) , ( [ thestates1 ] ) we have @xmath69 and by imposing symmetry condition ( i ) equation  ( [ unitary ] ) becomes @xmath70 we shall also impose that all overlaps are real numbers i.e. @xmath71 which you can do by careful choices of the local phase of the states .",
    "now because the overlaps are real @xmath72 @xmath73",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 this means all these probe states are orthogonal to one another .",
    "we will also define some final parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 that characterize the overlap of the remainder .",
    "@xmath78 @xmath79 what we are doing is basically defining the unitary transform @xmath80 that we want to perform on the states .",
    "we already know the relation @xmath68 , now we need another formula to relate the final variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we can do this from symmetry argument ( ii ) . by transforming the probe states in one basis to their representation in the other basis using equation  ( [ transform ] )",
    "then we get @xmath81",
    "we can re - write equations  ( [ thestates ] ) and ( [ thestates1 ] ) with the probe states normalized . normalized probe states from now on will be denoted with a hat i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "the normalized states are @xmath83 @xmath84 there are similar relations for the @xmath51-@xmath52 basis as well thanks to the symmetry condition ( ii ) , but because of this symmetry it is sufficient to analyze just one basis and carry the results over to the other basis .",
    "@xmath65 as it appears here is the fidelity .",
    "note from equations  ( [ normalizedstates ] ) , ( [ normalizedstates2 ] ) that these are entangled states .",
    "looking specifically at equation  ( [ normalizedstates ] ) , when bob makes his measurement in the basis that alice sent the state in , the only states that will eventually form the sifted key , he can get two outcomes .",
    "either the state was @xmath2 which occurs with probability @xmath65 in which case the superposition will collapse and eve s probe state instantaneously jumps to @xmath85 .",
    "this means eve has got away without causing a disturbance .",
    "the other outcome is @xmath3 , an error or disturbance in alice and bob s sifted key occurring with probability @xmath36 .",
    "just because eve got away without causing disturbance a proportion @xmath65 of the time does not necessarily mean she will conclude correctly what the state alice sent was .",
    "now eve has to discriminate between two density matrices because she can store her probes until the basis is publicly announced and choose the best measurement to determine which density matrix it was .",
    "eve s mixed states are @xmath86\\ ] ] the density matrices describing eve s probes after the @xmath47-@xmath48 basis has been announced are @xmath87 @xmath88 from equations  ( [ zeros ] ) we can see the four probe states form two orthogonal sets . one set @xmath89 occurs with probability @xmath36 and the other set @xmath90 occurs with probability @xmath65 .",
    "what eve can do is devise a measurement that unambiguously discriminates these two sets . because the measurement will also be compatible with the sets it will not change the states of the probes .",
    "eve can also tell , depending on the result of this first measurement , whether she has caused a disturbance to alice and bob s key .",
    "the second problem is now to discriminate between two , generally nonorthogonal states in the same set .",
    "the basis that gives eve the best chance of guessing the state correctly is the intermediate or breidbart basis . for two states @xmath91 and @xmath92 the probability of guessing the state correctly is @xcite @xmath93 we know the overlaps between the two sets from equations  ( [ f ] ) , ( [ d ] ) , ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ d1 ] ) . these are @xmath94 @xmath95 so the probability of eve guessing the correct state is @xmath96 where @xmath97 for example .",
    "it actually turns out that equation  ( [ naaaa ] ) is maximized when the probes in both sets have the same overlap i.e. @xmath98 so @xmath99 and because @xmath68 we have the optimum incoherent eavesdropping strategy .",
    "eve has the probability to guess correctly @xmath100 using the relations @xmath68 , @xmath101 and equation  ( [ naa2 ] ) we can express @xmath27 in terms of @xmath36 only giving @xmath102 this strategy does much better than the intercept - resend strategy at the cost of added technological complexity .",
    "griffiths and niu @xcite have proposed the quantum circuit that does the job .",
    "this strategy can also produce deterministic information on every state alice sends to bob at the price of completely randomizing their sifted key .",
    "this is a good example of the information - disturbance trade off .",
    "eve has a better chance of distinguishing her probe states the smaller she makes their overlap until they become orthogonal to one another and can be discriminated perfectly .",
    "the price for decreasing the overlap between eve s probes is that bob s density matrices become more uniformly mixed between the wanted and the unwanted states i.e. @xmath36 increases .",
    "this comes from nature s enforcement of unitary evolution , that all the overlaps must remain the same before and after the evolution .",
    "we know this is the optimum strategy from the derivation given by fuchs _",
    "the other interesting thing about this strategy is that can be regarded as an asymmetrical cloning machine , taking alice s state and producing two copies of unequal fidelity .",
    "one good copy is passed on to bob and one bad copy that is kept by eve .",
    "there are bounds on copying machines and the result in equation  ( [ theoptprob ] ) can be found from work by cerf _",
    "however in the derivation presented above the probe lives in a @xmath103 dimensional hilbert space , in other words the probe consists of two qubits . using a cloning machine the probe need only be of @xmath8 dimensions , a single qubit .",
    "this has been shown by niu and griffiths @xcite .",
    "what can alice and bob do about this situation if they know about both of these strategies ?",
    "the condition is that alice and bob can recover a secret key by one way privacy amplification if eve s mutual information on alice or bob s bit string is less than the mutual information alice and bob share @xcite . formally this constraint is @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the mutual information between alice and bob , @xmath106 is the mutual information between alice and eve and @xmath107 is the mutual information eve and bob share .",
    "we use the one way result for simplicity .",
    "the average mutual information alice and bob share on the sifted key after public announcement of the basis in the presence of an eavesdropper is just the average mutual information on a binary symmetric channel @xcite .",
    "the disturbance , @xmath36 , an eavesdropper introduces looks like a data flipping rate to alice and bob .",
    "@xmath108 @xmath105 can be expressed in bits by taking the logarithms to the base @xmath8 or nats by taking logarithms to the base @xmath109 .",
    "equation  ( [ binarychannel ] ) can be expressed more symmetrically in terms of a function @xmath110 @xcite as @xmath111 where @xmath110 is @xmath112 the average mutual information alice and eve , @xmath106 , and eve and bob share , @xmath107 , are equal for these strategies .",
    "the probability of the bit being flipped in this case is just @xmath35 . expressed in terms of the function @xmath110",
    "this is @xmath113\\ ] ] by comparing equation  ( [ one ] ) with equation  ( [ two ] ) we can find the maximum disturbance at which alice and bob can expect to obtain a secret key by privacy amplification i.e. @xmath114 . for a secret key to be obtained by _ one way _ privacy amplification @xmath115 for the intercept - resend strategy this is @xmath116 for secret key generation to be possible and for the optimal incoherent strategy @xmath117 this means if the channel has a noise level greater than this value then alice and bob can not use it for quantum key generation as they should assume all disturbance to derive from an eavesdropper @xcite if they are using one way privacy amplification .",
    "if they detect disturbance above this level then they must try the whole key generation process again or give up .",

    "this scenario reduces the proportion of states sent that have at least one photon in them from bob s point of view .",

    "this is not as bad a situation as scenario b but it is not as good as scenario a. the states in this scenario may go on to form part of alice and bob s sifted key and eve does not cause any additional reduction in the proportion of non - empty pulses reaching bob . just because eve does not receive a photon in her channel does not mean she need be completely ignorant of its identity .",

    "the only time eve must make a 50/50 guess is when there are the same number of detected photon for each measurement outcome . however , more than one photon detected for only one outcome will give eve a higher probability of guessing the state correctly so we think this is not a bad approximation .",

    "this attack is similar to the last one considered except now the eavesdropper has better technology and can use the strategy reported in section  [ oi ] and extract more information for a fixed disturbance . when scenario a occurs this time , eve can perform an interaction between the probe and the photon in her channel to maximize the disturbance to the photon s state and maximize the distinguishability of the probe .",

    "the first thing alice and bob can do is check the error rate in their keys . using the same criteria as in section  [ countermeasures ] for one way privacy amplification to be successful then @xmath189 if eve is using the intercept - resend strategy presented here alice and bob must detect a lower disturbance than @xmath190 to be able to distill a secret key . if eve is using the optimal incoherent attack then @xmath191 and finally if eve is using the photon - number splitting attack then @xmath192\\ ] ] the average mutual information as a function of @xmath162 , the error rate in alice and bob s sifted key is plotted for each of these strategies in figure  [ faintpulsefig ] for @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",

    "eve will not effect the photon number distribution that bob sees in the beam - splitting attacks providing she has set the beam - splitter transmission to equal the transmission efficiency , @xmath133 , of their original lossy quantum channel as shown in section  [ scenarios ] .",
    "the photon number distribution is still poissonian .",
    "however , with the more powerful qnd attack which is dependant on the number of photons in the pulse the photon number statistics bob sees will no longer be poissonian . in the strategy above we fixed the number of non - empty pulses to be equivalent to bob s expectations",

    "a more detailed analysis of this is given by flix _",
