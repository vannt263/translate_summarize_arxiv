    "hold under relatively mild conditions ; see schwartz @xcite .",
    "consistency in stronger metrics was considered by barron , schervish and wasserman @xcite and by ghosal , ghosh and ramamoorthi @xcite , and , shortly after , ghosal , ghosh and van der vaart @xcite and shen and wasserman @xcite developed techniques that allow us to prove frequentist rates of contraction of the posterior to the true infinite - dimensional parameter in the hellinger metric , if the prior is suitably chosen according to the structure of the nonparametric problem at hand .",
    "this led to further progress recently ; we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this literature has been successful in generalizing the scope of these techniques to a variety of different statistical models , and has naturally focussed on consistency and rates of contraction results in the _ hellinger",
    "_ distance .",
    "for instance , if @xmath5 is the unknown density to be estimated , and if @xmath6 is the posterior based on a prior @xmath7 and a sample @xmath8 with joint law  @xmath9 , results of the kind @xmath10 were established , where @xmath11 is the hellinger metric and where @xmath12 .",
    "such posterior contraction results are known to imply the same frequentist consistency rate @xmath13 , also in the metric @xmath14 , for the associated formal bayes estimators .    in this article",
    "we investigate the question of how to generalize results of this kind to more general loss - functions than the hellinger metric , with a  particular focus on @xmath0-norms , @xmath1 .",
    "such results are of interest for a  variety of reasons , for example , the construction of simultaneous confidence bands , or for plug - in procedures that require control of nonparametric remainder terms ( e.g. , in the proof of the bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem in semiparametric models in castillo @xcite ) .",
    "they are also of interest with a view on a more unified understanding of nonparametric bayes procedures that complements the existing @xmath0-type results for standard frequentist methods .",
    "the main challenge in extending the theory to the @xmath0-case , except for specific conjugate situations discussed below , rests in generalizing the le cam ",
    "birg testing theory for the hellinger metric to more general situations . a main ingredient of the proof of a result of the kind ( [ cont ] ) is that , in testing problems of the form @xmath15 universal tests with concentration bounds on type - ii errors of the type  @xmath16 exist , under assumptions on the size , or entropy , of the `` alternative '' space defining  @xmath17 .",
    "this fact is rooted in the subtle connection between nonparametric testing problems and the hellinger metric as highlighted in the work of le cam @xcite and birg  @xcite .",
    "a main contribution of this article is the development of a new approach to testing problems of the kind ( [ bltest ] ) based on concentration properties of linear centered kernel - type density estimators , derived from empirical process techniques . while this approach can only be used if one has sufficient control of the approximation properties of the support of the prior , it can be generalized to arbitrary @xmath0-metrics , including the supremum norm @xmath18 .",
    "the concentration properties of these tests depend on the geometry of the @xmath0-norm and deteriorate as @xmath19 , which is , in a sense , dual to the fact that the minimax testing rate in the sense of ingster @xcite approaches the minimax rate of estimation as @xmath19 .",
    "while our main results can be viewed as `` abstract '' in that they replace the entropy conditions in @xcite for sieve sets @xmath20 by general approximation - theoretic conditions ( see theorems [ general ] and [ generalbd ] below ) , our findings become most transparent by considering specific examples , selected in an attempt to reflect the spectrum of situations that can arise in bayesian nonparametrics : in section [ ex ] we study the `` ideal '' situation of a simple uniform wavelet prior on a hlder ball , the `` supersmooth '' situation of mixtures of normals , the case of random histograms based on a dirichlet process where no uniform bound on the @xmath21-norm of the support of the prior is available , as well as gaussian process priors of the kind studied in  @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that if @xmath22 is @xmath23-smooth , then the rate of contraction obtained in the @xmath0-norm for a posterior based on an adequately chosen prior of smoothness @xmath23 is , up to @xmath24 factors , and with @xmath25 , @xmath26 so as soon as @xmath27 our proof retrieves the minimax optimal rate , but for @xmath28 the rate deteriorates by a genuine power of @xmath29 .",
    "as @xmath23 approaches infinity this effect becomes more lenient and vanishes in the limit .",
    "we currently have no proof of the fact that our general theorem gives the right rate for bayesian posteriors if @xmath28similar problems are known with nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators in @xmath0-metrics ( cf .",
    "the proof of proposition  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "while we do not settle the issue of optimality of our rates for @xmath28 in this article , we also prove in theorem [ whitenoise1 ] below that in nonparametric gaussian regression the minimax rate of contraction can be obtained by certain diagonal gaussian wavelet priors , in all @xmath0-norms simultaneously .",
    "we believe that this result is closely tied to the fact that the posterior is then itself gaussian , and conjecture that our rates can not be substantially improved in the nonconjugate situation .",
