    "the implementation of a simple color selection technique to select efficiently galaxies at redshift larger than 2.5 ( steidel 1996 , madau 1996 , steidel 1999 , fontana 1999 ) revealed a population of blue , actively star forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "galaxies as bright as those observed are likely hosted inside the most massive halos at high z ( bagla 1998 , baugh 1998 , katz , hernquist & weinberg 1999 , coles 1998 , but see somerville , primack & faber 1998 and kolatt 1999 for a slightly different view ) .",
    "these halos are more clustered ( a bias factor of the order of 2 - 5 ) compared to the general distribution , providing strong support ( adelberger 1998 , giavalisco 1998 ) to models of biased galaxy formation ( davis 1985 ) . under the effect of gravitational instability these large halos",
    "will merge together and form the massive clusters we see today ( governato 1998 ) .",
    "semi  analytical models ( baugh 1998 ) further suggested that the present day descendents of lbg in protoclusters would be preferentially giant ellipticals with an old red population of stars .",
    "bright , red cluster members reside preferentially at the center of clusters and often have been found to have a lower orbital velocity dispersion ( chincarini & rood 1977 , mellier 1988 , biviano 1992 , whitmore 1993 , biviano 1996 , carlberg 1997 ) than the global cluster population .",
    "recent results with full redshift information for a large sample of clusters ( adami , biviano & mazure 1998 , ramirez , de souza & schade 2000 ) and photometric observations of the coma cluster ( kashikawa 1998 ) give support to these claims .",
    "adami , based on a simple theoretical modeling , suggest that orbits of the brightest galaxies have to be circular to explain the decrease in velocity dispersion and at the same time be consistent with the hypothesis of dynamical equilibrium at the cluster center .",
    "indeed theoretical prejudice would expect to find galaxies formed in massive halos at high redshift to reside preferentially in the central region of clusters .",
    "moore ( 1998 ) and white & springel ( 1999 ) showed that , in cdm cosmologies , matter already in virialized objects at high redshift makes a large fraction of the mass within the central regions of present day clusters .",
    "dynamical friction , if acting efficiently on a long enough time scale could further segregate massive halos at the center of clusters ( but the effect is likely to be small ; see ghigna 1998 and colpi , mayer & governato 1999 , hereafter cmg99 ) . in recent years , numerical and analytical studies of galaxy clusters have rapidly increased in resolution and detail ( e.g. katz & white 1993 , carlberg 1994 , frenk 1996 , fusco  femiano & menci 1998 , tormen , diaferio & syer 1998 , klypin 1999 ) .",
    "frenk ( 1996 ) found mild spatial segregation of the most massive galaxies , they also included gas dynamics and a simple description of star formation processes .    in this work",
    "we use a unified approach that couples a state of the art numerical simulation of a galaxy cluster with a detailed , semi  analytical description of galaxy formation inside individual dark",
    "matter halos .",
    "this method will allow us to study the spatial and orbital distribution of galaxies in a moderately rich cluster with unprecedented detail and to investigate the relation between lbgs at high redshift and present day cluster galaxies .",
    "we used a very high resolution n - body ( i.e. collisionless ) simulation of a galaxy cluster ( slightly more massive than virgo , @xmath3 within the virial radius , defined as the radius where @xmath4 ) formed in a cluster normalized scdm cosmology .",
    "this cluster contains over 4 @xmath1 10@xmath5 particles within the virial radius ( it is described in full detail in ghigna 1998 , g98 , ghigna 1999 , g99 , and lewis _ _ 1999 ) .",
    "the effective spatial resolution is of the order of @xmath6 , and we are able to resolve substructure halos with circular velocities v@xmath7 down to 50 km / sec and with pericenters larger than @xmath8 , a significant improvement compared with all previous works ( here v@xmath7 is defined as @xmath9 ) ) .    the cluster forms through major mergers at redshift about 0.5 ( defined as when its main progenitor has roughly 50% of the final cluster mass ) , accreting additional mass and galaxies at later times . it is well virialized and close to dynamical equilibrium by the present time ( see g98 fig.1 ) . in this high resolution",
    "simulation , numerical overmerging ( e.g. , moore , katz & lake 1996 ) is likely to be almost negligible , especially for the most massive halos .",
    "we can follow the evolution of thousands of halos as they participate in the build up of the cluster and subsequently orbit inside it .",
    "even if severely stripped by the cluster tidal field , virtually all halos maintain their identity once inside the cluster , and only a few get destroyed by the tidal field or decay by dynamical friction at its center ( see g99 for a full discussion ) .",
    "therefore , within this simulation is possible to follow the descendents of all halos and specifically those associated with lbg ( see next subsection ) through subsequent outputs to the present time .",
    "we first located dark matter halos inside the clusters with the algorithm skid ( see g98 and g99 for details , springel 1999 for an alternative method ) at the final time of the simulation and traced them back to dark matter halos at z = 3 .",
    "high z halos were identified with `` friends  of  friends '' ( fof , davis 1985 ) , using a linking length @xmath10 the initial grid spacing , as fof gives more robust masses for halos outside larger virialized structures . at @xmath11 the region containing the cluster",
    "has yet to collapse , but hundreds of smaller halos have already formed within a complex network of filaments . for each halo we measured mass and circular velocity at their virial radius at high z and at their individual tidal radii as imposed by the cluster potential at the present time",
    "( again see g98 for details ) .",
    "the growth of dark matter halos can be followed both with n  body simulations and the extended press & schechter approach ( or ps , see press & schechter 1974 , bower 1991 , bond 1991 ) . within the semi  analytical approach a simple set of equations then describes the cooling of gas inside the dark matter halos and the subsequent star formation history , predicting size , luminosities ( including the effects of dust ) , colors and the morphology of galaxies formed inside these halos ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 , cole 1994 , cole 2000 ) .",
    "we used the approach first outlined in cole 1994 and then further developed in baugh 1998 and cole 2000 this approach is remarkably successful in predicting the main properties of high redshift and local galaxies with a minimum set of constrained parameters ( baugh 1998 , see also somerville & primack 2000 ) .",
    "however , the semi - analytical method based on the ps alone can not recover the full 3d distribution of galaxies , making the full n - body simulations necessary .",
    "for each halo identified at redshift 3 in the n  body simulation and for the whole cluster at the present time we used the semi - analytical approach ( and so a ps merging history ) to determine their galaxy content . at the present time",
    "the halos present inside the cluster are paired with semi - analytical cluster galaxies based on their circular velocity .",
    "statistically this is equivalent to using merger trees obtained directly from n - body simulations ( see governato 1998 , benson et al .",
    "1999 ) . as a test we looked at a set of different merger tree histories for a few clusters of the same mass as the one in our simulation to verify that the scatter introduced by our approach on the average properties as a function of circular velocities of the galaxy population was negligible .",
    "in fact , the galaxies produced with the semi - analytical approach show a rather tight luminosity - circular velocity relation , independently of the details of their merging history or of that of the parent cluster .",
    "this simple approach is then quite adequate for our purpose of broadly defining the types of galaxies hosted both in massive halos at high z and inside their cluster descendents at the present time as a function of their mass ( see kauffmann 1999 , springel 1999 for an approach based on the full merger trees obtained from n  body simulations ) .",
    "our procedure gives the properties of the galaxies hosted inside each given halo complete with full dynamical information ( position and velocity inside the cluster ) .",
    "once galaxies were placed inside dark matter halos , we selected at redshift of 3 those that , applying the same criteria , would have been selected as lbgs ( steidel ( 1996 ) . at the final time",
    "we then compare the properties of their descendents vs. those of the 20 brightest cluster members ( comparable to the number of redshift usually measured for a single real cluster ) and the whole cluster galaxy population .",
    "at a redshift of 3 there are 12 halos with mass above 10@xmath12 m@xmath13 ( the biggest object in the region that will later form the cluster has a mass of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the semi - analytical approach predicts that each of these halos hosts at least one lbg galaxy , sometimes two .",
    "indeed the n - body simulation already shows significant substructure inside them .",
    "there is some intrinsic scatter from one semi - analytical realization to another , depending on the details of the merging histories of individual halos .",
    "sometimes smaller halos ( on average less than one per realization ) host lbgs , perhaps `` observed '' while they were at their maximum luminosity .",
    "this does not change our results significantly .",
    "halos containing lbgs are aligned along filaments and are rapidly flowing along them to form massive groups at z @xmath15 1.50.75 and then merge to form the main progenitor of the cluster by z@xmath160.5 . a large fraction ( 7 out of 12 ) merge together to form the central core of the cluster ; 90% of the mass contained in their central part ( defined as particles within the central @xmath17 ) and likely tracers of their stellar component ends up in the inner @xmath18 of the cluster .",
    "their barionic cores ( not present in our simulation that includes only the dark , collisionless component ) would then most likely merge together to form the central cd , as the decay time for any remnant of significant mass with orbital apocenters less than @xmath19 from the cluster center is much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "the five surviving halos have been tidally stripped and orbit in the central part of the cluster . according to the semi ",
    "analytical approach the descendents of lbgs are the most luminous ellipticals in the cluster at the present day .",
    "this result is independent of the details of the semi  analytical model used . in the approach used e.g. in kolatt ( 1999 ) a large number of lyman break galaxies are small starbursting galaxies .",
    "these strong episodes of star formation originate from fly - bys between satellites inside more massive halos . in principle",
    ", these satellites could be stripped away from their parent halos and show a different spatial bias , making our conclusions dependent on the analytical modelling .",
    "however , our simulation shows that none of the satellites of the massive halos at z = 3 survive as distinct entities by the present time , having merged with their hosts before the formation of the main body of the cluster .      at @xmath20",
    "all lbg descendents can be found within the inner @xmath21 , i.e 60% of the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "they are more concentrated than the average cluster population ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is more evident in the distribution of the pericentric distances ( inset of fig .  1 ) and is true for apocenters as well .",
    "to strengthen the significance of the signal , we have verified that this holds true at a nearby epoch ( @xmath22 ) . using wilcoxon test",
    ", we estimate that the probability of this spatial segregation happening by chance is less than 2% . also considering that seven lbgs contributed to form the central galaxy , the mass contributed to the cluster by lbg descendents is more centrally concentrated compared with the global cluster population . as halos with large circular velocities",
    "are associated with galaxies of higher luminosities than the average galaxy cluster population , this causes a mild luminosity segregation .",
    "it is likely that the early formation time of this cluster and its following quiet merging history ( it forms slightly earlier than average for its mass in a scdm cosmology ; g98 ) contributed to this , as recent infall was not substantial enough to accrete massive halos at the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "we then measured the orbital parameters for all galaxies inside our cluster ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the orbital circularity @xmath23 is defined as the ratio of j , the orbital angular momentum , to j@xmath7 , the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same energy .",
    "( lacey & cole 1994 , tormen 1997 , g98 ) . here",
    "the orbital energy is defined assuming spherical symmetry for the cluster mass distribution and the most bound particles for its center .",
    "there is no obvious difference in the distribution of circularities between descendents of lbg , the twenty brightest objects in the cluster and the rest of the galaxy population .",
    "the formal average values of @xmath23 for the three cases are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , with quite similar dispersions around the mean value ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the dark matter background has similar orbital properties ( g98 ) .",
    "results at @xmath20 and @xmath28 are similar .",
    "this finding confirms results obtained with analytical and numerical models ( van den bosch 1998 , cmg99 ) that dynamical friction is not efficient at circularizing orbits of even the most massive and old galaxies inside clusters .",
    "we used the theory of linear response as described in cmg ( which agrees extremely well with n - body experiments ) to measure the orbital decay predicted for a group sized halo entering the cluster environment at @xmath29 ( i.e. the formation time of the main progenitor of the cluster itself ) . once the effect of tidal stripping are included ( see again cmg99 ) decay times are of the order of several times the hubble time , and both pericenters and apocenters have changed only by a few percent by the present time .",
    "the luminosity segregation putatively observed in real galaxy clusters would then be an imprint of their hierarchical build up rather than the effect of subsequent strong dynamical evolution .",
    "this orbital segregation should be present ( springel , 2000 in preparation ) or could even be larger in clusters formed in a open or flat cosmology , where clusters would form typically at higher redshift and where the accretion at late times slows down considerably .",
    "our simulation allows us for the first time to test the dynamical mass estimate based on a complete sample of substructure halos .",
    "we estimated the virial mass of the cluster from the galaxies projected velocity dispersions , using the classic estimator ( heisler , bachall & tremaine , 1985 ) :    @xmath30    where v@xmath31 is the line of sight velocity and r@xmath32 the projected separation of a given galaxy pair .",
    "this estimator is useful for its simplicity , even if it overestimates the mass inside the virial radius by about 40% ( see also girardi 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "we do not include galaxies in halos outside the virial radius , so that our sample is free of nearby back / foreground interlopers .",
    "our results confirm previous results ( frenk 1996 , tormen 1997 ) that the use of only the few brightest galaxies as mass estimators results in an underestimate of the cluster mass compared to using the whole galaxy sample , by up to a factor of 2 if the brightest galaxy is included ( it has a very small velocity compared to the cluster galaxies as a whole ) .",
    "additional scatter ( @xmath1530% ) is added when considering individual axial projections .",
    "contrary to previous suggestions , this bias is not due to the most massive galaxies being on more circular orbits , but the fact that these galaxies sample only the central part of the cluster mass distribution and therefore have a lower velocity dispersions , as the peak in v@xmath7 _ for the cluster as a whole _ is reached only at about @xmath33 , i.e. close to the apocenters of their orbits . even excluding contamination from background and foreground objects",
    "at least 20 galaxies are needed to correctly sample the cluster potential and obtain a reliable mass measurement .",
    "likely , even more redshifts would be needed in case the cluster had significant nearby structures ( filaments or rich groups ) in the near fore / background .",
    "using the high resolution simulation of a galaxy cluster coupled with semi  analytical methods of galaxy formation we identify at redshift of 3 a dozen halos hosting at least one lyman break galaxy . at the present time",
    "descendents of lbgs can be identified with the central cd galaxy and galaxies hosted in substructure halos with v@xmath7 in the range 200 to 550 km / sec .",
    "all 12 lbg descendents end up within the the inner @xmath34 ( or 60% of the cluster virial radius ) ; 7 merged together to form the central galaxy .",
    "these descendents are the most bright elliptical galaxies in the cluster .",
    "these results are largely independent from the details of the semi - analytical method used .",
    "we confirm previous findings obtained with simulations of lower resolution ( e.g frenk 1996 ) that the most massive galaxies are likely to be centrally segregated and have lower orbital velocity dispersions when compared to the global cluster galaxy population .",
    "however , this effect is small , and harder to detect when only limited information ( redshifts and positions projected on the sky plane ) is available .",
    "spatial and velocity segregation for bright cluster members has long been observed in coma ( mellier 1988 ) and in larger samples of nearby clusters ( biviano 1992 , 1996 ) , but the observational picture has been somewhat complicated by the small number of redshift available per cluster and by the fact that they have usually been collected only within the central part of the clusters themselves .",
    "clearly a larger sample of observed and simulated clusters is needed to allow a more quantitative comparison between observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "we expect the segregation of bright ellipticals to be larger in well virialized clusters and in cosmologies were recent infall is small ( e.g. open or flat cdm cosmologies ) .",
    "galaxies in our simulated cluster move on quite eccentric orbits , due to the almost radial infall typical of hierarchical clustering .",
    "there is no significant difference in the orbital eccentricity of different galaxy populations and the dark matter background .",
    "also , orbits do not change in shape significantly over time ( dynamical friction does not change the orbital eccentricity as shown also in cmg99 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that to measure the virial mass of the cluster is crucial that a significant number of galaxies is used in order to correctly sample the cluster density profile .",
    "a sample , restricted to the most bright cluster members is likely to be biased and underestimate both the cluster total mass and velocity dispersion . in this simulated cluster ,",
    "about twenty member galaxies sampling the mass distribution out to the virial radius are required for a correct estimate of the cluster total mass .",
    "this number could well be higher for a cluster far from virial equilibrium or with significant structures nearby .",
    "as our analysis shows , virial mass estimates suffer from an additional scatter of about 30% , due to velocity anisotropies along the cluster projection .",
    "this source of scatter can not easily be removed increasing the number of galaxies .",
    "as clusters likely formed only a few gyrs ago , dynamical effects like energy equipartion or dynamical friction are very unlikely to have played any significant role in originating the mass / velocity segregation , especially considering that only a small part of the cluster mass is attached to individual galaxies ( @xmath35 , see g98 ) .",
    "if confirmed by a larger sample of real and simulated clusters , the observed segregation of their more massive galaxies would rather be the signature of their hierarchical build  up .",
    "we thank carlton baugh and andrew benson for providing us the semianalytical galaxy formation models and acknowledge useful discussions with frank van den bosch , rychard bouwens and cedric lacey .",
    "this work was partially supported by the eu network for galaxy formation and evolution , the nasa / ess programme , and pparc .",
