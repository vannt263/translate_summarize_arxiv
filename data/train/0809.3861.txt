    "this model can also be considered as a slow modulation wave approximation to the discrete sine - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "similar to the nonlinear band - gap tunneling observed by geniet and leon @xcite , it is reported that there is a critical threshold @xmath10 for supratransmission when the propagation constant @xmath7 is in the forbidden band @xmath11 @xcite .    in fig .",

    "the only difference of defocusing arrays from the self - focusing ones is that there will be a @xmath28 phase - difference between neighboring lattices .",
    "it is presented in @xcite that the numerical result for the threshold amplitude deviates rapidly from the approximation ( [ app_kh ] ) .",

    "remembering the aforementioned promising applications of nonlinear tunneling , it is therefore of interest to obtain an approximation of the threshold amplitude in the other limit @xmath30 .",
    "it is one of the aims of the present report .",
    "the other aim is to understand mathematically the mechanism of the nonlinear tunneling .",
    "it is mentioned , but not rigorously proved , @xcite that the supratransmission happens because of the emergence of two solutions at the critical driving amplitude , i.e.  a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "if it is the case , this then means that the threshold amplitude is not necessarily the amplitude of the corresponding fundamental soliton eq .",
    "( [ app_kh ] ) . understanding the source of supratransmission",
    "also will allow us to explain , e.g. , the reason why there is no threshold amplitude for nonlinear tunneling when the driving frequency is in the lower forbidden band @xmath31 .    nonetheless , one may question the relevance of our first aim , as supratransmission is quickly trapped by the lattices for large @xmath7 .",
    "even though our analysis may be not immediately applicable to the present case , the aim is still of relevance .",
    "there are several experimentally realizable discrete equations that support traveling solitons in a parameter region where the gap solitons are highly localized . as a particular example is the discrete schrdinger equation with saturable nonlinearity in the large nonlinearity coefficient regime @xcite .",
    "we have observed supratransmission in this equation and have successfully applied our analysis presented herein to obtain an approximation to the threshold amplitude @xcite .",
    "later on in this paper , we also conjecture that our analytically obtained approximation , presented in terms of a power series expansion , may well be convergent uniformly in the region of interest , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the mathematical procedure presented herein can also be applied as an alternative method to analyze the bistability effect considered , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we might even consider it simpler and more appropriate as the analysis can then be done solely in its discrete set - up , with no necessity of approximating the problem with its continuous counterpart @xcite . in this study , we will show that the supratransmission is indeed related to saddle - node bifurcations . to mathematically prove this , our strategy is as follows .",
    "we will first prove the existence of a mode bifurcating from the constant solution @xmath32 due to the driving site .",
    "we will also show that there is a singular mode bifurcating from infinity .",
    "we will then demonstrate that these two modes collide in a saddle - node bifurcation by developing an asymptotic analysis in the range of @xmath7 large .",
    "such an analysis is doable in that regime because the modes are highly localized .",
    "the final step to show that the critical amplitude is the same as the threshold amplitude for supratransmission is to prove that the mode bifurcating from zero state is stable , all the way on its existence region . using this result",
    ", then we can derive an approximation of the threshold amplitude in terms of a power series expansion that can be calculated to any order .",
    "numerical computations will be presented as well to compare our analytical results .",
    "our paper will be outlined in the following structures . in subsection 2.1 , we present our asymptotic analysis for the existence of monotonically decaying static solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the next subsection will contain our study on the stability analysis of solutions discussed in the preceding subsection . using the same procedures",
