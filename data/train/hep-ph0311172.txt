    "the neutrino spectra that arrive at the earth from a core collapse supernova ( sn ) have information about the neutrino masses and mixings encoded in them .",
    "the @xmath0 neutrinos observed from sn  1987a were extensively used trying to constrain the solar neutrino parameters as well as @xmath1 and the neutrino mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the determination of neutrino parameters depends crucially on our understanding of the primary neutrino fluxes produced inside the sn . in spite of large uncertainties on these primary fluxes ,",
    "some of their robust features may be exploited to identify the type of neutrino mass hierarchy and put bounds on the mixing of @xmath2 in the `` third '' neutrino mass eigenstate  @xcite .",
    "when neutrinos pass through the earth before arriving at the detector , their spectra may get modified due to the earth matter effects .",
    "the presence or absence of these effects can distinguish between different neutrino mixing scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of neutrino spectra at two different detectors can clearly give signatures of the matter effects , which can be used not only for the determination of the neutrino parameters  @xcite , but also to extract information about the density structure of the earth core  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the cherenkov glow at icecube may also be combined with the signal at a water cherenkov detector like super- or hyper - kamiokande to identify the earth effects  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to ascertain the presence of these matter effects using the signal at a single detector .",
    "it has recently been pointed out @xcite that the earth matter effects on supernova neutrinos traversing the earth mantle give rise to a specific frequency in the `` inverse energy '' spectrum of these neutrinos .",
    "this frequency , which may be identified through the fourier transform of the inverse energy spectrum , is independent of the initial neutrino fluxes and spectral shapes .",
    "therefore , its identification serves as a model independent signature of the earth matter effects on sn neutrinos , which in turn can distinguish between different scenarios of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "if the sn neutrinos reach the detector `` from below , '' they have to travel through the earth matter .",
    "if the nadir angle of the sn direction at the detector is less than 33@xmath3 , the neutrino path crosses the earth core .",
    "an investigation of the effect of the core on the observed neutrino spectra is therefore necessary for a complete understanding of the earth effects . as we shall see later in this paper , the passage through the core increases the chances of the identification of the earth effects .",
    "the core density is almost twice the mantle density and this sudden density jump gives rise to new features in the spectra .",
    "when the sn neutrinos traverse the earth core in addition to the mantle , one does not get a single specific frequency as in the mantle - only case , indeed as many as seven distinct frequencies are present in the inverse energy spectrum .",
    "we study the strengths of these frequency components analytically and show that three of these frequencies dominate .",
    "these three frequencies can also be clearly observed in the fourier transform of the inverse energy spectrum when averaged over many simulated sn neutrino signals .    although it is difficult to isolate these frequencies individually from the background fluctuations from a single sn burst , we suggest a procedure that can identify the presence of these frequency components in a sizeable fraction of cases .",
    "certain characteristics of the distribution of the frequency components in the background fluctuations are identified and used to reject the null hypothesis of the absence of earth effects .",
    "we quantify the efficiency of this algorithm by simulating the sn neutrino signal at a large scintillation detector like lena @xcite and at a megaton water cherenkov detector like hyper - kamiokande . whereas the scintillation detector has the advantage of a much better energy resolution , this is compensated in part by the larger number of events in a megaton water cherenkov detector .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] , we discuss the positions and the strengths of the frequencies that characterize the `` inverse - energy '' spectra of the neutrinos crossing the earth mantle as well as the core . in sec .  [ peaks ] , we simulate the sn neutrino spectra at the detectors and study the features of the peaks with the background fluctuations averaged out . in sec .",
    "[ bkgnd ] , we introduce a method to identify the peaks in the presence of background fluctuations and make a quantitative estimation of the probability of peak identification as a function of the location of the sn in the sky . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we summarize the results .",
    "the neutrino detectors , apart from a heavy - water detector like sno , can give detailed spectral information only about the @xmath4 flux .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the @xmath4 spectrum in this paper . in the presence of flavor oscillations",
    "a @xmath5 detector actually observes the flux @xmath6 f_\\xbar^0 ( e)\\ , , \\label{fedbar}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the initial and detected flux of @xmath9 respectively , and @xmath10 is the survival probability of a @xmath5 with energy @xmath11 after propagation through the sn mantle and perhaps part of the earth before reaching the detector .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath4 are observed through the inverse beta decay reaction @xmath12 .",
    "the cross section @xmath13 of this reaction is proportional to @xmath14 , making the spectrum of neutrinos observed at the detector @xmath15 .    in the absence of earth effects",
    ", the dependence of the survival probability on @xmath11 is very weak .",
    "a significant modification of @xmath16 due to the earth effects takes place only when the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal , i.e. , @xmath17 , or when the @xmath2 component of the third mass eigenstate is restricted to @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the neutrino mass eigenstate that has the smallest @xmath2 admixture .",
    "the identification of the earth effects can then rule out the `` null hypothesis '' of an inverted hierarchy and @xmath20 , thus excluding a large chunk of the neutrino mixing parameter space . in the language of table  [ abc - table ]",
    ", the earth effects can be present in scenarios a and c whereas they are absent in scenario  b. case  b is thus the null hypothesis .",
    ".the presence of earth effects in different neutrino mixing scenarios .",
    "[ abc - table ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to study the model dependence , we consider two models that give very different predictions for the neutrino spectra .",
    "the first is motivated by the recent garching calculation @xcite that includes all relevant neutrino interaction rates , including nucleon bremsstrahlung , neutrino pair processes , weak magnetism , nucleon recoils and nuclear correlation effects .",
    "the second is the result from the livermore simulation @xcite that represents traditional predictions for flavor - dependent sn neutrino spectra that have been used in many previous analyses .",
    "the parameters of these models are shown in table  [ tab : models ] . to study the background , we use the mixing parameters of scenario b in table  [ abc - table ] in which the earth effects are absent .    for the earth density profile we use a 5-layer approximation of the prem model as parametrized in ref .",
    "we start with a sn at 10 kpc and simulate the neutrino signal at a 32 kiloton scintillation detector and a megaton water cherenkov detector . in both detectors , the neutrino signal is dominated by the inverse beta reaction @xmath12 , while all other reactions have a negligible influence on the analysis below . the detector response is taken care of in the manner described in refs .",
    "the major difference between the scintillation and the water cherenkov detector is that the energy resolution of the scintillation detector is roughly six times better than that of the cherenkov detector .",
    "this compensates the size advantage of a megaton water cherenkov detector .      to start with",
    ", we consider the power spectrum resulting from averaging 1000 sn simulations .",
    "this eliminates the fluctuations in the background , and illustrates the characteristics of the peaks in a clear manner . the power spectrum at a 32  kt scintillation detector for different distances traveled through the earth is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lena_g - l_av_mantle - core_bck ] .",
    "the top panels use the garching model whereas the bottom ones use the livermore model .",
    "the left panels show three typical cases when the neutrinos traverse only the mantle , whereas the right panels represent the passage of neutrinos through the mantle as well as the core .",
    "only inverse beta decay events have been taken into account .",
    "we have checked that the inclusion of the other reactions like the elastic scattering off electrons or the charged current reactions on carbon do not change the results .",
    "the neutral current reactions on carbon , although providing a large number of events , have been neglected , as the monoenergetic photon produced by the decay of the excited carbon could be tagged in such a detector  @xcite .",
    "the following observations may be made :    1 .   the average background approaches 1 for @xmath21 , as expected @xcite .",
    "the region @xmath22 is dominated by the `` 0-peak , '' which is a manifestation of the low frequency terms in eqs .",
    "( [ fedbar - y ] ) and ( [ fesum - y ] ) .",
    "note that the 0-peak in the background case is wider than that in the signal case .",
    "this is because the background case corresponds to the scenario b , which is also the one wherein there is a complete interchange of the @xmath4 and @xmath23 spectra .",
    "the energy of the detected @xmath4 spectrum is thus higher , which results in a broader 0-peak .",
    "when the neutrinos traverse only the mantle , only one peak appears at the expected value of @xmath24 that is proportional to the distance @xmath25 traveled through the mantle . for @xmath26",
    "km , the position of the peak lies at such low frequencies that it can hardly be distinguished from the 0-peak .",
    "this illustrates that neutrinos must travel a minimum distance through the earth before the earth effects become observable .",
    "when the neutrinos travel also through the core , we observe three dominant peaks in each case , corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ fesum - y ] ) .",
    "we observe that , as the total distance traveled through the earth increases , * the third peak moves to higher @xmath29 , since @xmath30 . *",
    "the second peak , whose position is proportional to @xmath31 , also gets shifted towards higher @xmath29 as the increase in @xmath32 is larger than the decrease in @xmath33 .",
    "* the first peak , on the other hand , moves to lower @xmath29 values , since as the trajectory of neutrinos approaches the center of the earth , the distance traveled through the mantle decreases and so does the frequency of the lowest peak , @xmath34 .",
    "this makes the detection of this peak harder at larger distances traveled through the earth .",
    "the model independence of the peak positions may be confirmed by comparing the top and bottom panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : lena_g - l_av_mantle - core_bck ] .",
    "the peaks obtained with the livermore model are stronger as a result of the larger difference between the @xmath4 and @xmath23 spectra in that model , which increases the value of @xmath35 in eqs .",
    "( [ fedbar - y ] ) and ( [ fesum - y ] ) .",
    "however , the positions of the peaks are the same as those obtained with the garching model .",
    "the energy resolution of a water cherenkov detector is about a factor of six worse than that of a scintillation detector .",
    "this means that the energy spectrum is more `` smeared out '' and higher frequencies in the spectrum are more suppressed .",
    "this makes the peak identification more difficult , and even a detector of the size of super - kamiokande turns out not to be sufficient @xcite .",
    "we show the power spectrum expected at a megaton water cherenkov detector in fig .",
    "[ fig : hk_g - l_av_mantle - core_bck ] for the two sn models considered here and for different locations of the sn .",
    "again we have only assumed the events from the inverse beta decay , since the contribution from other reactions is significantly smaller .",
    "the following observations may be made from the power spectra :    1 .",
    "the 0-peak is broader , which makes the averaged background approach one for larger values of @xmath29 ( @xmath36 ) than in the case of the scintillation detector .",
    "this is because the energy smearing decreases the strengths of high frequency components and increases the strengths of low frequency components .",
    "2 .   in the case of neutrino propagation only through the mantle , the peak shifts to higher @xmath29 as @xmath25 increases , as expected .",
    "however , the suppression of high frequencies tends to shift the peak locations to slightly lower @xmath29 values than at the scintillation detector . in addition , as the peak position moves to larger @xmath24 , the strength of the peak decreases and the peak becomes harder to detect .",
    "when the neutrinos traverse both the mantle and the core , it is observed that * the third peak among the expected three dominant ones , corresponding to @xmath37 , is highly suppressed due to large @xmath28 and is undetectable . *",
    "the other two peaks corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath38 have lower @xmath29 values , and are not as suppressed as the @xmath28 peak . moreover , the @xmath39 peak is stronger than the @xmath40 one .",
    "* the @xmath39 peak moves to lower frequencies as the total distance traveled through the earth increases . beyond a certain distance , it merges with the background 0-peak and becomes undetectable .",
    "the peak positions with the garching and livermore spectra are at nearly the same positions , though the extra feature of high @xmath29 suppression is observed to shift the peaks with the garching model to slightly lower values of @xmath29 as compared to those with the livermore model . the peaks with the livermore model naturally have more strength than the ones with the garching model .",
    "though the analytic approximations seem to work well with the averaged power spectrum , the understanding of the statistical fluctuations within the signal from a single sn is crucial for the identification of the peaks . as observed in @xcite and confirmed in sec .",
    "[ peaks ] , the average of the background power spectrum is indeed one for all values of @xmath29 after the dominant low frequency peak in the power spectrum dies out .",
    "as long as we are free of the influence of this low frequency peak , the area under the power spectrum between two fixed frequencies @xmath41 and @xmath42 is on an average @xmath43 . in the absence of earth effects",
    ", this area will have a distribution centered around this mean .",
    "the earth effect peaks tend to increase this area .",
    "if the area in a specific interval is found to be more than what mere background fluctuations can allow , the peak can be identified with confidence .    since in the real world",
    "the presence of fluctuations in the signal will spoil any naive theoretical peak , we need to introduce a prescription to carry out the analysis .    1 .",
    "once we know the total distance traveled by the neutrinos through the earth , we can calculate the position where the peak should lie . instead of looking for the maximum in the height of the power spectrum",
    ", we consider a more robust observable , namely the area around the position of the peak , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : exemple1 - 3 ] .",
    "when only one peak centered at @xmath24 is expected , we consider the interval @xmath44 with @xmath45 , roughly the expected width of the peak . in order to avoid the 0-peak contamination we set a lower limit at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) for the scintillator ( water cherenkov ) detector .",
    "when the neutrinos also cross the earth core , multiple peaks are present and we measure the area from @xmath46 until @xmath48 in such cases .",
    "2 .   the next step is to analyze the statistical significance of the result obtained . for this purpose",
    "we compare the value of the measured area with the distribution of the area in the case of no earth matter effects .",
    "since the different frequencies are not uncorrelated , the background distribution is not simply gaussian centered at @xmath49 and with width @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we perform a monte carlo analysis of the background case and calculate the exact distribution with which one can compare the actual area measured .",
    "we illustrate this in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : exemple1 - 3 ] , where the black curve shows the area distribution of the background . the confidence level of peak identification may then be defined as the fraction of the area of the background distribution that is less than the actual area measured .",
    "we denote the area corresponding to @xmath51% c.l . by @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : exemple1 - 3 ] also shows @xmath53 , the area corresponding to a peak identification with 95% confidence .",
    "since the peak identification algorithm is statistical in nature , it is worthwhile to have an idea of the probability with which a peak can be identified with a given confidence .",
    "this probability clearly depends on the distance traveled by the neutrinos through the earth , which in turn is determined by the location of the sn in the sky .",
    "we parameterize the sn location by the nadir angle @xmath54 of the sn direction at the detector .",
    "we simulate the area distribution for the `` signal '' using the neutrino mixing scenarios that allow earth effects and compare it with the background distribution .",
    "the probability @xmath55 of peak identification at @xmath51% c.l .  is the fraction of the area of the signal distribution above @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exemple1 - 3 ] , it has been indicated with the red - hashed region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lena_g - l_eta ] we show @xmath56 and @xmath57 as a function of @xmath54 in the case of a scintillation detector , for the two sn models considered .",
    "an increase in the distance traveled through the earth corresponds to a decrease in @xmath54 .",
    "the passage through the core corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "one can see that the presence of the core enhances the chances of detecting the earth matter effects .",
    "the probability is higher at values of @xmath54 close to the boundary between the mantle and the core because the three peaks are clearly visible .",
    "the oscillation pattern arising at this region stems from the interference of the first two peaks in the spectrum , whose positions at this point differ only by @xmath59 . as the distance traveled by the neutrinos through the core increases , @xmath55 decreases , the reason being the approach of the first peak to the lower limit frequency , @xmath60 , and its eventual disappearance .    as expected , the chances of peak identification are also higher when the primary spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath23 differ more . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lena_g - l_eta ] , the livermore model predicts much larger chances of a successful peak identification .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lena_g - l_eta ] , we assume the garching model and compare the results obtained with a 32 kton scintillator detector and a megaton water cherenkov detector . in the latter case , as neutrinos travel more and more distance in the mantle the peak moves to higher @xmath29 values , and due to the high @xmath29 suppression as described in sec .",
    "[ cherenkov ] , the efficiency of peak identification decreases .",
    "however , when the neutrinos start traversing the core , additional low @xmath29 peaks are generated and the efficiency increases again .",
    "one of the features of this algorithm is its robustness .",
    "however in some cases it turns out to be very conservative .",
    "for instance , if we have a look at the megaton water cherenkov , the peaks at the lowest frequencies are almost eaten - up by the 0-peak of the background when the neutrinos cross the earth core , cf .",
    "[ fig : hk_g - l_av_mantle - core_bck ] . setting @xmath61 as the lower limit of the area integration results therefore in a loss of considerable amount of information under these conditions . in this particular case",
    "it is possible to optimize the efficiency of the method by choosing a _ floating _ lower cut : instead of considering a fixed value , @xmath62 , as the lower limit for the area integration , one defines @xmath41 as the frequency at which the spectrum has the first minimum after neglecting the effect of spurious fluctuations . with this modified prescription one",
    "can again compare the area distribution for the background and that of the signal , and calculate a new @xmath55 .",
    "we have checked this method for both the scintillator and the water cherenkov detector . for the former",
    "the improvement is not relevant .",
    "the reason is that the second and third peaks contribute significantly to the signal .",
    "so , even when the first peak disappears behind the 0-peak of the background for fixed lower cut - off , the loss of information is not important .",
    "however in the case of a water cherenkov detector the efficiency is significantly enhanced for paths traversing the earth core as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hk_g_eta_method ] .",
    "due to the suppression of the peaks located at higher frequencies only the first peak contributes significantly to the signal .",
    "however for trajectories involving small @xmath54 this peak is centered at very low frequencies , almost completely hidden by the 0-peak of the background . under this situation",
    "if one allows the lower bound to shift to smaller frequencies the whole peak contributes to the signal , and therefore the probability to see the earth matter effects increases . on the other hand when the neutrinos only cross the mantle the location of the unique peak is mostly at @xmath63",
    "therefore , this modified prescription does not help much to improve the efficiency to observe the modulation of the neutrino spectra due to the earth matter effects .",
    "when neutrinos coming from a core - collapse supernova pass through the earth before arriving at the detector , the spectra may get modified due to the earth matter effects .",
    "the presence or absence of these effects can distinguish between different neutrino mixing scenarios .",
    "we have seen that these earth matter effects on supernova neutrinos can be identified at a single detector through peaks in the fourier transform of their `` inverse energy '' spectrum .",
    "the position of these peaks are independent of the initial neutrino fluxes and spectral shapes .",
    "we have performed an analytical study of the positions and the strengths of the frequencies that characterize the inverse - energy spectrum of the neutrinos for different neutrino trajectories through the earth . in the case",
    "that the sn neutrinos only traverse the mantle a single peak shows up in the power spectrum .",
    "in contrast we have observed that if both the mantle and the core are crossed before the neutrinos reach the detector as many as seven distinct frequencies are present in the inverse energy spectrum .",
    "however only three peaks are dominant in the power spectrum .",
    "this increase in the number of expected peaks leads to an easier identification of the earth matter effects .    in order to illustrate the qualitative features of the present analysis we have considered the power spectrum resulting from averaging 1000 sn simulations for different sn models and different detector capabilities . in particular",
    "we have assumed a 32 kton scintillator detector and a megaton water cherenkov detector .",
    "we have shown how the energy resolution turns out to be crucial in detecting the modulation introduced in the neutrino spectra by the earth matter effects .",
    "first , the better resolution of the scintillator detector compensates for the larger water cherenkov detector size . on the other hand , the worse energy resolution in water cherenkov detectors",
    "does not only imply the need of a larger volume but also suppresses significantly the peaks at higher frequencies , in contrast to the case of scintillator detectors .",
    "we have considered two different sn models as an illustration of the current uncertainties in the initial fluxes .",
    "we have observed that the strength of the peaks is larger in those sn models with bigger differences between @xmath5 and @xmath64 spectra .",
    "however , we have found that the position of the peaks is model independent .",
    "therefore their identification serves as a clear signature of the earth matter effects on sn neutrinos , which in turn can help to discard the neutrino mass scheme with inverted mass hierarchy and @xmath65 .",
    "we have introduced a simple algorithm to identify the peaks in the presence of background fluctuations .",
    "this method is based on the integration of the area around the expected position of the peak . by comparing the area distribution without and with the spectral modulations induced by the earth matter effects",
    "we have analyzed the statistical significance of the result .",
    "as expected the presence of the core as well as a larger difference in the initial spectra enhance the probability of identifying the earth effects .",
    "we have also presented a variation of the algorithm which improves its efficiency significantly in the case of a water cherenkov detector for neutrino trajectories passing through the core .",
    "therefore we believe that more efficient algorithms could be developed .",
    "the results we presented should be considered therefore as conservative lower limits .",
