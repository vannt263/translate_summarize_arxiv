    "the correspondence between rational convex polytopes and projective toric varieties is well - known .",
    "it pertains to several fields , including combinatorics , convex geometry , symplectic geometry , algebraic geometry .    within this picture",
    ", simple polytopes correspond to toric varieties that are rationally smooth ( i.e. , their singularities are of finite - quotient type ) .",
    "we will only consider this restricted correspondence .",
    "stanley used this correspondence to prove mc mullen s conjectured conditions on the combinatorics of simple convex polytopes , via the hard lefschetz theorem for toric varieties @xcite . along with other results by teissier , khovanskii and gromov @xcite ,",
    "this uncovered a fruitful link between convex geometry and algebraic geometry .",
    "on the other hand , stanley s proof contains hints of some `` flaws '' in the correspondence .",
    "firstly , simple polytopes come in continuous families ( by perturbing the facets directions ) , whereas toric varieties , dubbed `` frigid crystals '' in @xcite , do not .",
    "the reason is that no toric variety corresponds to a nonrational polytope .",
    "a second issue is that the toric variety may not be smooth . in stanley",
    "s proof , the first flaw is easily circumvented , since an arbitrary simple convex polytope can be made rational by a small deformation preserving the combinatorial type .",
    "the second one is overcome by using intersection cohomology , which is an overkill @xcite .",
    "both flaws turn into major difficulties when one tries to generalize these ideas to the nonsimple case ( karu s work @xcite ) .",
    "the non existence problem is solved by prato in @xcite , by introducing a generalization of toric orbifolds which is non hausdorff when the polytope is nonrational .",
    "relying on works by meersseman and verjovsky @xcite , and by prato @xcite ( and also on @xcite ) , we take a new approach by realizing the space corresponding to any simple convex polytope as the leaf space of a smooth foliation .",
    "this simultaneously fixes both flaws above : even though we are in principle interested in the leaf space , we lift all statements and proofs to the level of the foliation , where everything is smooth and hausdorff .    a more accurate formulation of the above is made in terms of fans : recall that to any convex polytope @xmath1 , we can associate its normal fan @xmath2 , which is complete and polytopal . the map @xmath3 taking a rational simple convex polytope @xmath1 to a toric variety @xmath4 factors out as @xmath5 .",
    "the first map is non - injective and the second one is the classical one - to - one correspondence between complete simplicial rational polytopal fans and rationally smooth projective toric varieties ( these objects beeing seen up to isomorphism ) .",
    "we propose a four - way generalization of the correspondence @xmath6 .",
    "the roles of varieties and fans are played , respectively , by _ leaf spaces of certain foliations _ and suitable _ triangulated vector configurations_.    notice that the correspondence @xmath6 is based on an implicit choice of a vector configuration : the set of primitive generators of the fan s rays .",
    "the four generalizations are , in increasing order of importance from our point of view :    1 .",
    "we allow non - polytopal fans .",
    "we allow orbifold multiplicities .",
    "this amounts to taking nonprimitive generators on rays .",
    "3 .   we have more generators than rays : some vectors in the configuration may not correspond to a ray .",
    "4 .   we do not require rationality of the configuration .",
    "each of these generalizations has already appeared in the literature .",
    "we will simultaneously refine , generalize or desingularize several known constructions , thus giving a unified picture of the smooth , orbifold and nonrational cases .",
    "we will also give evidence that the rich interplay between convex and algebraic geometries carries over .",
    "we give a simplified account of earlier constructions .",
    "each starts from a convex - geometric object , and ( using gale duality ) defines an algebraic- or complex - geometric object .",
