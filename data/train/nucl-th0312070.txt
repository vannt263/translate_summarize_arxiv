    "exactly solvable models serve as a guideline for understanding the properties of correlated many - body systems . already in the sixties ,",
    "richardson solved the eigenproblem of a constant pairing interaction in a set non - degenerate single - particle levels for fermion  @xcite and boson  @xcite systems .",
    "however , it turned out that in the fermion case the solutions exhibit singularities which are hard to treat numerically  @xcite . recently , exactly solvable pairing models have gained new attention  @xcite , with applications to nanometalic grains  @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) , bose einstein condensates  @xcite and nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "it was first shown that the pairing model was integrable by finding the complete set of commuting integrals of motions @xcite , and subsequently , three new families of fully integrable and exactly solvable models @xcite giving rise to a large class of pairing hamiltonians with non - uniform matrix elements @xcite were presented .",
    "these models are exactly solvable , except for the singularities occurring in fermion systems for some critical values of the pairing strength .",
    "this problem , in spite of some early attempts to cure it @xcite , precluded for over forty years the use of these exactly solvable models for a wide range of applications , ranging from condensed matter to nuclear physics .",
    "moreover , the recent developed extensions of the exact solution to pairing hamiltonians including the isospin degree of freedom ( @xmath0 pairing ) @xcite with promising applications to @xmath1 nuclei and high @xmath2 superconductivity , suffer from the same kind of singularities .    in this letter show how the richardson equations can be solved numerically , avoiding the singularities , through an appropriate change of variables .",
    "this procedure provides a fast an accurate way to solve the equations for a constant pairing interaction .",
    "the method can be applied as well to more general exactly solvable hamiltonians associated with a coupled set of non - linear equations of the richardson type .",
    "the exactly solvable pairing hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath3 with @xmath4 any set of single - particle energies and @xmath5 the pairing interaction strength .",
    "the @xmath6-pair eigenstates of this hamiltonian have the form @xmath7 |0\\rangle , { \\label{eq : bethe_ansatz}}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a state without paired particles ( a racah quasispin vacuum state , @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding energy @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 the complex variables @xmath11 can be found by solving a set of non - linear equations : @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 depend on the level degeneracies and on the structure of the vacuum state @xmath8 . for fermions ,",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pair degeneracy ( for the nuclear shell model @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 is the seniority of the level @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath20 because of the pauli principle . solving this set of nonlinear equations solves the eigenproblem for the pairing hamiltonian  eq.([eq : pairinghamiltonian ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the algebraic solution becomes numerically unstable at certain critical values of the interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "this is caused by singularities in the first and second terms in eq.([eq : richardson ] ) , when some of the variables @xmath21 are approaching the value @xmath22 .",
    "one can understand this from the electromagnetic analogy for the exactly solvable pairing model  @xcite : in the fermion case , the single - particle levels @xmath4 and the variables @xmath11 correspond to opposite charges .",
    "therefore a group of variables can cluster around a single - particle level in such a way that for each of the variables the repulsive charge of the other variables is compensated for by the attractive charge of the single - particle level .",
    "these singularities occur for fermions in double or multiple degenerate levels . in the case of doubly degenerate equidistant levels these singularities can be handled for the ground state  @xcite , but the problem arises again in the treatment of the excited states @xcite . in previous calculations it was necessary to tune the solutions by hand as soon as they approach a singularity .",
    "no general solution method was known until now .",
    "figure  [ fig : xvars ] illustrates the behavior of the variables in case of multiply degenerate levels ( see below for the details of the model ) .",
    "a general approach to solve the richardson equations eq.([eq : richardson ] ) , starts from an approximate solution in the weak - interaction limit ( see below ) .",
    "then this solution is evolved adiabatically up to the desired interaction strength by gradually increasing the value of @xmath5 . at each step in @xmath5 ,",
    "the previous solution has to be updated . for dealing with the singularities ,",
    "it is useful to notice first that the variables @xmath11 in eq.([eq : richardson ] )   are most sensitive to the other variables nearby .",
    "therefore one can divide the set of variables @xmath11 into several _",
    "clusters _ of variables , grouped around different single - particle levels . by solving the equations for each cluster separately , one can obtain a solution for the whole system iteratively . a practical way to organize the clusters ,",
    "is to link each variable to its nearest single - particle level @xmath23 , and to consider a cluster for each level that has variables around it .",
    "the question now is how to solve the equations for each cluster , particularly in the case of singularities .",
    "let us consider the set of indices @xmath24 of the @xmath25 variables that cluster around a level @xmath26 .",
    "then one can consider the equations @xmath27 with @xmath28 the function @xmath29 describes the influence of the other levels and the variables of the other clusters on the variables in the cluster @xmath24 .",
    "because of the way the clusters are set up , the function @xmath29 will be a smooth function in the region around @xmath30 where the variables of the cluster are located .",
    "the singularities will occur in the first two terms of eq.([eq : clusterequation ] ) . in the case",
    "that some of the variables in the cluster approach the value @xmath26 , the divergences in the first and the second term of eq.([eq : clusterequation ] )  must cancel out .",
    "multiplying eq.([eq : clusterequation ] )  by @xmath31 , and summing over the @xmath32 variables @xmath11 at the singular point , leads to the condition @xmath33 with @xmath32 the number of variables that actually converge to @xmath26 . for fermions the value @xmath34 corresponds to the pair degeneracy of the level @xmath30 : because of the pauli principle , no more fermion pairs can occupy the level . trying to put more pairs in that level results in a singularity .",
    "in fact , the structure of the ground state eq.([eq : bethe_ansatz ] )  does not result in a forbidden occupation of the level .",
    "on expanding the wave function of eq.([eq : bethe_ansatz])in terms of the pair creation operators @xmath35 , one finds that the leading term cancels out because of the fermionic anti - commutation rules .",
    "this translates into the numerical difficulties encountered in the solution of the equations . for bosons @xmath36 , and hence eq.([eq : singularity_condition ] )",
    "shows that singularities do not occur in the bosonic case .",
    "this can also be understood from the electrostatic analogy : boson pairs and single - particle levels have charges of the same sign .",
    "therefore the variables try to avoid each other at all times , and singularities do not occur .",
    "the above procedure suggests a way to remove the singularities from the equations : multiplying eq.([eq : clusterequation ] )  with @xmath37 , for some power @xmath38 , and summing over all variables @xmath11 in the cluster .",
    "the resulting equations become , for @xmath39 : @xmath40 with @xmath41 the compact form of eq.([eq : clusterequation3 ] )  suggests that it might be advantageous to solve them for the new variables @xmath42 instead of the original variables @xmath11 .",
    "note that given a set of variables @xmath43 , one can easily construct the polynomial whose roots correspond to the values @xmath44 .",
    "hence one can switch from one set of variables to the other .",
    "the problem comes with the quantities @xmath45 : these are functions of the @xmath11 , and it is not straightforward to express them as functions of the @xmath42 . however , for a given set of variables @xmath11 , one can easily evaluate the values @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , one can evaluate the gradient matrix @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the derivative with respect to @xmath48 of eq.([eq : clusterequation3 ] )  for @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 can be evaluated accurately using a special inversion algorithm for vandermonde matrices  @xcite .",
    "therefore one can solve the new set of equations , eq.([eq : clusterequation3 ] )  for @xmath54 , in the new variables @xmath55 using a standard gradient technique such as the multi - dimensional newton - raphson method  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of a singularity , the gradient matrix becomes ill - conditioned : the diagonal elements of the gradient matrix are given by @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the diagonal element will vanish for the index @xmath58 .",
    "this will occur as soon as @xmath59 , which matches the value for which singularities can occur , see eq.([eq : singularity_condition ] ) .",
    "in such a case the lower - triangular matrix @xmath60 becomes singular .",
    "the other part of the gradient matrix , @xmath53 , is derived from the smooth function @xmath61 .",
    "a series expansion of @xmath29 in @xmath62 will be dominated by the lowest orders .",
    "therefore the elements of @xmath63 are very small for larger values of @xmath64 . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath65 can not be determined accurately from the set of equations eq.([eq : clusterequation3 ] ) .",
    "one can avoid this problem by limiting the cluster sizes to at most the critical value @xmath66 , and by using @xmath67 as an unknown variable instead of @xmath68 .",
    "if more variables are found near to the same single - particle level , one can always divide the cluster into smaller , well - separated clusters , because at most @xmath32 of the variables can approach the single - particle level closely . knowing @xmath69 and @xmath70 , one",
    "can still straightforwardly construct the polynomial whose roots give the corresponding values @xmath11 .",
    "therefore one can easily switch between the two sets of variables .",
    "furthermore @xmath67 behaves smoothly , even at a singularity . to set up an efficient gradient method",
    ", it is useful to replace eq.([eq : clusterequation3 ] )  for the last value , @xmath71 , by a similar equation obtained using @xmath72 : @xmath73 with @xmath74 . for weak interaction strengths the function @xmath75 is dominated by the constant term @xmath76 , see eq.([eq : clusterfk ] ) . in the weak interaction limit one can take @xmath61 to be a constant .",
    "the resulting functions @xmath45 take the simple form @xmath77 now the equations eq.([eq : clusterequation3 ] )   and eq.([eq : clusterequation3b])can be solved straightforwardly to yield the variables @xmath78 , from which one can construct the polynomial that gives a unique set of variables @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting eigenstate will depend on the size of the cluster for each of the single - particle levels .",
    "this establishes a one - to - one correlation between the eigenstates of the non - interacting system ( @xmath79 ) and the eigenstates of the weakly - interacting system .",
    "one can conclude that the richardson equations are complete : their solutions generate all eigenstates , and there are no spurious solutions .",
    "one can obtain the solutions for strong interaction strengths by solving the weakly interacting case first , and then gradually increasing the interaction strength . at each step",
    "one can use the gradient method outlined above in order to update the solution to the new interaction strength .",
    "it is useful to adapt the stepsize in interaction strength to the convergence of the iterative procedure by taking smaller steps in @xmath5 when the convergence of the newton - raphson method for the variables @xmath80 becomes slower , which typically occurs around the critical @xmath5 values .",
    "one more ingredient is needed to avoid problems with the singularities : when the interaction strength passes through a critical value , the variables @xmath11 passing through a singularity can change from real to complex or vice versa . at the same time the variables @xmath78 will become very small , except for @xmath81 . even using the new variables , the gradient method does not lead to the right solution when it has to pass through critical values of the interaction strength .",
    "one can avoid this problem by including an extrapolation step based upon the previous solutions .",
    "this extrapolation has to be done in the variables @xmath78 , because they vary smoothly through the singularities and they remain real all the time .",
    "assume that converged solutions @xmath82 and @xmath83 were obtained for values @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the interaction strength .",
    "the variables @xmath83 are grouped into clusters . for each cluster ,",
    "one evaluates the variables @xmath86 and @xmath87 . because the variables @xmath42 behave smoothly , even near a singularity",
    ", one can estimate the variables @xmath42 for the new interaction strength @xmath5 by linear extrapolation : @xmath88 the resulting values of @xmath42 can then be updated using the newton - raphson method or another gradient method .",
    "the extrapolation step avoids the problems with the singularities and greatly improves the convergence of the method .     &",
