    "symmetry principle is one of the most important concepts for modern physics . when a continuous symmetry of hamiltonian or lagrangian is not preserved in the ground state , spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    "occurs @xcite .",
    "ssb is ubiquitous in nature from magnetism , superfluidity and superconductivity to quantum field theories , in which it is the most important basis to achieve unification of fundamental forces .",
    "when such a ssb occurs , there must appear gapless modes known as nambu - goldstone modes ( ngms ) @xcite .",
    "ngms are the most important degrees of freedom at low - energy @xcite . in relativistic systems , dispersion relations of ngms",
    "are always linear . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion relation can be either linear @xmath1 or quadratic @xmath2 in nonrelativistic systems .",
    "they are called type - i and type - ii ngms , respectively @xcite .",
    "prime examples are given by the heisenberg ferromagnets and antiferromagnets , which give one type - ii and two type - i ngms , respectively , although symmetry breaking pattern is the same , @xmath3 , and there are two broken generators for both cases .",
    "spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of ultracold atoms @xcite provide a variety of examples of type - ii ngms @xcite . in high energy physics ,",
    "type - ii ngms appear in dense quark matter @xcite .",
    "the number of ngms coincides with the number of generators of broken symmetries in relativistic theories . on the other hand",
    ", the number of ngms in nonrelativistic systems has been unclear until recently .",
    "nielsen and chadha gave the inequality among the numbers of type - i and ii ngms and broken generators @xcite .",
    "with the idea of nambu @xcite , watanabe and brauner gave a conjecture in ref .",
    "@xcite stating that the number of type - ii ngms is a half the rank of the watanabe - brauner ( wb ) matrix , whose components are commutators of generators corresponding to broken symmetries , sandwiched by the ground state .",
    "then , the equality of the nielsen - chadha inequality and the watanabe - brauner conjecture have been proved recently by using the effective lagrangian approach based on a coset space @xcite , by mori s projection operator method @xcite , and later by the bogoliubov theory @xcite . since this finding ,",
    "extensive studies of ngms in nonrelativistic systems have been made in various directions , such as massive ( pseudo ) ngms @xcite , coupling to gauge fields @xcite , space - time symmetry breaking @xcite , finite temperature and density @xcite , higher derivative terms @xcite and topological interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when there exists a topological soliton or defect , ngms are localized around it .",
    "examples contain vortices in scalar becs , helium superfluids @xcite and dense quark matter @xcite , a domain wall in ferromagnets @xcite and two - component becs @xcite , and a skyrmion line in ferromagnets @xcite . among these cases ,",
    "when zero modes are non - normalizable , there appear non - integer power dispersion relations , such as @xmath4 for a domain wall in two - component becs @xcite and @xmath5 for a vortex in scalar becs or helium superfluids @xcite . however , these dispersion relations become quadratic so they are type - ii ngms , when transverse sizes are small enough as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for a vortex and in ref .",
    "@xcite for a domain wall .",
    "it has been also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that non - integer dispersion does not occur in the uniform ground states .    among various approaches ,",
    "the effective lagrangian based on coset spaces is very powerful because everything can be described in terms of only symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , it does not work in the presence of additional zero modes other than ngms such as quasi - ngms @xcite .",
    "this is the case that we discuss in this paper .",
    "quasi - ngms appear when the symmetry of potential term or equation of motion is larger than the symmetry of lagrangian or hamiltonian and it is spontaneously broken in the ground state . in the mean field approximation , gapless modes are determined from the flat directions of the potential term , so that there can appear additional zero modes in addition to the conventional ngms . in relativistic theories , they appear in technicolor models @xcite and supersymmetric field theories @xcite .",
    "when the lagrangian in supersymmetric theories has a symmetry @xmath6 , the superpotential always has an enlarged symmetry @xmath7 , a complexification of @xmath6 . as a consequence , as proved in refs .",
    "@xcite , there must appear at least one quasi - ngm when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken in supersymmetric theories ( in the absence of gauge interaction @xcite ) .",
    "in nonrelativistic systems , quasi - ngms appear in condensed matter systems such as a - phase of @xmath8he superfluids @xcite and @xmath9 spinor becs @xcite , and color superconductivity of dense quark matter @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we presented the bogoliubov theory approach to formulate general treatment of ngms in nonrelativistic systems .",
    "the advantages of this approach are that one can deal with additional zero modes such as quasi - ngms in the same ground with ngms on one hand , and that one can also deal with ngms for space - time symmetry breaking in the same manner on the other hand .    in this paper , we discuss quasi - ngms in the bogoliubov theory . in the presence of quasi - ngms , there are two interesting physics that the effective field theory approach can not deal with :    1",
    ".   there can exist type - ii quasi - ngms consisting of one genuine zero mode and one quasi zero mode or two quasi zero modes .",
    "some genuine zero modes can turn to quasi zero modes with keeping the total number of zero modes .",
    "apparently , the effective lagrangian based on coset space can not deal with the first point even if one ignores quasi - ngms , because of type - ii mode which contains only one symmetry generator .",
    "it is the same for the second point .",
    "we focus on the cases that the potential term has non - compact symmetry whose lie algebra inevitably contains non - hermitian generators , which is motivated by quasi - ngms in supersymmetric theories , , so the generators are all hermitian , and hence the problem explained here does not occur @xcite . ] and/or that the symmetry of the gradient term is reduced by multiple components with different particle masses .",
    "we show that the wb matrix does not work to count type - ii modes in this case .",
    "on the other hand , we use the gram matrix in the bogoliubov theory .",
    "this reduces to the wb matrix only when all generators are hermitian . in general cases",
    ", we can still count the number of type - ii modes by using the gram matrix .",
    "we present the perturbation theory to calculate dispersion relations of ( quasi-)ngms .",
    "we find in general that there exist type - ii modes made of two quasi - zero modes or one genuine and one quasi - zero modes , in addition to usual case of two genuine zero modes .",
    "we call the former quasi - ngms and the latter conventional ngms .",
    "we demonstrate this theory by an explicit example exhibiting the above two features , that is , the complex linear @xmath0 model @xcite consisting of @xmath10 complex scalar fields with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we again point out that the coset space approach to the effective lagrangian has a difficulty in this case .",
    "even when one includes quasi - ngms in the effective theory , the coset space based on enlarged symmetry gives negative norm in general because of non - hermitian generators , resulting in the instability .",
    "for instance , let us consider the simplest case that @xmath11 is spontaneously broken completely .",
    "let @xmath12 be a coset element where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are ng and quasi - ng modes , respectively .",
    "then , the coset space  lagrangian \" is @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , parameterizing a non - compact direction of @xmath11 , has a negative norm .",
    "this is because we required an isometry of @xmath11 on the metric of the target space since in the coset approach one constructs a @xmath6-invariant metric on @xmath16 .    before closing introduction",
    ", we note that quasi - ngms are different from pseudo - ngms .",
    "the latter appear when approximate symmetry of the lagrangian is spontaneously broken , as the case of pions in the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the effect of explicit symmetry breaking gives a mass gap to pseudo - ngms even in the mean field approximation . on the other hand , quasi - ngms",
    "are gapless up to the mean field approximation .",
    "however , quasi - ngms may be gapped beyond the mean field approximation in general ; in the perturbative regime where quantum effects are taken into account , they obtain a small gap , in which case quasi - ngms become pseudo - ngms .",

    "the counting by the wb matrix @xcite is no longer applicable due to the non - hermitian properties of generators of a noncompact group , while the counting based on the gram matrix @xcite is still valid .      for definiteness , we consider the following hamiltonian describing the @xmath10-component scalar fields : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "let us expand eigenvectors and eigenvalues as @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "henceforth we are only interested in the cases where @xmath185 is an eigenvector of @xmath85 with zero eigenvalue .",
    "thus we set @xmath186 , and the perturbation equations up to @xmath187 is given by @xmath188 since @xmath189 is given by an eigenvector of @xmath85 with zero eigenvalue , and since the components of zeroth - order solutions in the higher - order terms @xmath190 with @xmath191 can be always eliminated , we can set @xmath192 form the first order equation ( [ eq : pertrb1st ] ) , we immediately have @xmath193 the next discussion differs depending on whether @xmath194 is zero or not .",

    "then we obtain @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "thus , the eigenvector up to @xmath198 can be written as @xmath199 taking the @xmath115-inner product between @xmath138 and the second - order equation ( [ eq : pertrb2nd ] ) , we obtain @xmath200 if we define @xmath201 matrix @xmath202 whose @xmath203-component is given by @xmath204 , the above is the eigenvalue problem of @xmath202 .",
    "since @xmath140 is assumed to be positive - definite , the matrix @xmath202 is positive - definite , real , and symmetric matrix .",

    "therefore , there exist a real orthogonal matrix @xmath208 such that @xmath209 becomes diagonal , and the eigenvalues are all real and positive . if we introduce a new basis by @xmath210 and @xmath211 , and write the eigenvalues as @xmath212 , @xmath213 thus , the first order eigenvalue is given by @xmath214 , giving the linear dispersion @xmath215 , and the eigenvector is given by @xmath216 . here",
    "we note that the tilde - added vectors , @xmath217 s and @xmath218 s also satisfy the same @xmath115-orthogonal relations in eq .",

    "+ next , let us consider the case @xmath219 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : firstorderperturb ] ) , we have @xmath220 and hence @xmath221 .",
    "thus the perturbation equation begins from the second - order , given by @xmath222 we first introduce the following vectors @xmath223 s by the gram - schmidt - like process : @xmath224 the corresponding @xmath225 can be written in the same form : @xmath226 this can be shown as follows .",
    "since @xmath86 and @xmath115 are b - hermitian , @xmath227 and @xmath228 hold . noting them and the relation @xmath229 , we have @xmath230 the new basis @xmath231 do not change the @xmath115-orthogonal relations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmarelations ] ) , and further satisfy the following : @xmath232 since @xmath86 is b - hermitian , the relation @xmath233 also holds .",
    "then , let us redefine the starting zeroth order eigenvector @xmath189 as @xmath234 this redefinition does not change the result of the first - order perturbation calculations in eq .  ( [ eq : firstorderperturb ] ) . then , taking the @xmath115-inner product between the second - order equation ( [ eq:2ndorderprtrb ] ) and @xmath235 , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : diagonaltypei ] ) , we obtain @xmath236 next , taking the @xmath115-inner products between eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ndorderprtrb ] ) and @xmath223 or @xmath237 , we obtain @xmath238 now , let @xmath239 and @xmath240 be @xmath241 matrices whose @xmath33-component is given by @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively . then , the above equations are interpreted as the eigenvalues problem of the following b - hermitian matrix @xmath244 : @xmath245 due to the assumption that @xmath140 is positive - definite , @xmath246 is also positive - definite .",
    "thus , from the theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite ( or from theorem 3.4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there exists a b - unitary matrix @xmath40 such that @xmath247 if we write new basis vectors diagonalizing @xmath244 as @xmath248 , the dispersion relation of type - ii mode arising from @xmath249 is given by @xmath250 , and that from @xmath251 is given by @xmath252 .",
    "we thus obtain type - ii dispersion relations .",
    "+ finally we add a remark .",
    "if we rewrite the tilde - added vectors @xmath253 with tildeless notations as @xmath254 , then they satisfy the following @xmath115-orthogonal relations : @xmath255 if we set @xmath87 in these relations , it becomes a revisit of the @xmath115-orthogonal relations given in subsec .",
    "4.1 of ref .",
    "the derivation shown here is also applicable to the case @xmath87 .",
    "the derivation here means that the perturbative calculations and derivations of type - i and type - ii dispersion relations do not need the block - diagonalization of the wb matrix , if we appropriately solve the perturbative equation for degenerate zero eigenvalues .",
    "however , in the special case @xmath87 , as was shown in subsec .",
    "2.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the choice of the basis such that the wb matrix becomes block - diagonal makes perturbative calculations a little easier .",
