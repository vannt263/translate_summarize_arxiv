    "the possible existence of higgs - like bosons ( hereafter referred as @xmath2higgs  ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) has already a long history in modern physics .",
    "for instance , let us mention the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite - including the minimal supersymmetric model as one of its specific realizations - allowing for five scalar or pseudoscalar bosons , three of which neutral and , perhaps , one of them at least quite light .",
    "another example of this kind is the axion model , originally introduced in @xcite as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath3 axial symmetry .",
    "nowadays , the axion is a pseudoscalar field appearing in a variety of theories with different meanings including superstring theory , yielding sometimes a massless particle and others a massive one : in astrophysics the axion represents a good candidate of the cold dark matter component of the universe .",
    "in fact , there are other scenarios , e.g. spontaneously broken lepton - number symmetry @xcite , leading to very light or even massless bosons ( majorons ) which might be detected in very rare decays of strange and beauty particles @xcite . on the other hand , another kind of ( neutral ) scalar particles ( familons ) with either flavor - changing or flavor - conserving couplings to fermions , arise assuming a global family symmetry spontaneously broken @xcite . to end this quick outlook beyond the sm",
    ", a scalar particle ( the radion ) proposed in the framework of the randall - sundrum model @xcite of extra dimensions , corresponding to the quantum excitations of the interbrane separation @xcite , could mix with the standard higgs and couple to sm fields @xcite . also kaluza - klein ( scalar ) gravitons in an add scenario @xcite could eventually lead to measurable deviations from the sm @xcite .",
    "although there are well established lower mass bounds for the standard higgs ( e.g. from lep searches @xcite ) , the situation may be different in several scenarios and models beyond the sm where such constraints would not apply , leaving still room for light higgs bosons ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "needless to say , any possible experimental signal or discovery strategy of higgs - like particles should be examined with great attention .    in this regard ,",
    "let us remind that the search for axions or light higgs in the decays of heavy resonances has several attractive features .",
    "firstly , the couplings of the former to fermions are proportional to their masses and therefore enhanced with respect to lighter mesons .",
    "second , theoretical predictions are more reliable , especially with the recent development of effective theories like non relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) @xcite , appropriate to deal with such bound states from first principles .",
    "indeed , intensive searches for a light higgs - like boson ( to be generically denoted by @xmath4 in this paper ) have been performed so far according to the so - called wilczek mechanism @xcite in the radiative decay of vector heavy quarkonia like the upsilon resonance ( i.e. @xmath5 ) .",
    "so far , none of all these searches has been successful , but have provided valuable constraints on the mass values of light higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this letter i will focus on a possible signal of new physics based on the @xmath2apparent  breaking of lepton universality in bottomonium decays : _ stricto sensu _ , lepton universality implies that the electroweak couplings to gauge fields of all charged lepton species should be the same . according to the interpretation given in this work , the possible dependence on the leptonic mass of the leptonic branching fractions of @xmath0 resonances below the @xmath1 threshold ( if experimentally confirmed by forthcoming measurements )",
    "might be viewed as a hint of the existence of a higgs of mass about 10 gev .",
    "let us get started by writing the well - known van royen - weisskopf formula @xcite including the color factor for the leptonic width of a vector quarkonium state without neglecting leptonic masses , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant ; @xmath8 denotes the mass of the vector particle ( a @xmath9 resonance in this particular case ) and @xmath10 is the charge of the relevant ( bottom ) quark ( @xmath11 in units of @xmath12 ) ; @xmath13 stands for the non - relativistic radial wave function of the @xmath14 bound state at the origin ; finally , the @xmath2kinematic  factor @xmath15 reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "leptonic masses are usually neglected in eq.(1 ) ( by setting @xmath15 equal to unity ) except for the decay into @xmath18 @xmath19 pairs .",
    "let us note that @xmath20 is a decreasing function of @xmath21 : the higher leptonic mass the smaller decay rate .",
    "however , such @xmath21-dependence is quite weak for bottomonium .    in this work",
    ", i am conjecturing the existence of a light higgs - like particle whose mass is close to the @xmath0 mass and which could show up in the sequential decay : @xmath22 actually , this process may be seen as a continuum radiative transition that in principle permits the coupling of the bottom quark - antiquark pair to a particle of variable mass and @xmath23 : @xmath24 ( always positive charge conjugation ) . in the present investigation",
    ", we will confine our attention to the two first possibilities : a scalar or a pseudoscalar boson .",
    "let us remark that if indeed the @xmath4 mass were quite close to the @xmath0 mass , on the one hand the ( pseudo)scalar propagator could enhance the width of process ( 3 ) ; on the other hand , the emitted photon would become soft enough to remain experimentally below detection threshold and the contribution ( 3 ) would be experimentally ascribed to the leptonic channel , thereby ( slightly ) increasing its decay rate .",
    "both related points constitute cornerstones along this paper and will be discussed in more detail .      motivated by the study of heavy quarkonia production and decay , where intermediate non - perturbative states are thought to play an important ( sometimes leading ) role @xcite , one may envisage the existence of equivalent intermediate hadronic stages after the radiative decay of a vector resonance as shown in eq.(3 ) , before annihilating into a charged lepton pair .",
    "state ( still unobserved at present except for a recent claim @xcite ) : in such a case only the @xmath26 state and a sharply defined mass would be allowed .",
    "nevertheless , notice that the foreseen mass difference between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 states , recently estimated in @xcite to be 36 - 55 mev , makes in practice almost no difference with respect to our later analysis based on a continuum state . ]    in a naive quark model , quarkonium is treated as a nonrelativistic bound state of a quark - antiquark pair in a static color field which sets up an instantaneous confining potential .",
    "indeed this picture has been remarkably successful in accounting for the properties of heavy quarkonia",
    ". however , it overlooks gluons whose wavelengths are larger that the bound state size : dynamical gluons permit a fock decomposition of physical quarkonium states beyond the leading non - relativistic description .",
    "thus , in a vector resonance like the @xmath27 , the heavy quark pair can be in a spin - trilet , color - singlet state in the lowest fock state , but the @xmath25 system could also exist in a configuration other than @xmath29 since the soft degrees of freedom can carry the remaining quantum numbers , although with a smaller probability .",
    "chromoelectric and chromomagnetic transitions can connect different fock states in physical processes subject to selection rules and governed by distinct probabilities .",
    "these ideas have been cast into the rigorous framework of an effective non - relativistic theory for the strong interaction ( nrqcd ) @xcite , widely applied to heavy quarkonia phenomenology ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the authors of @xcite have shown the physical relevance of soft gluon emission in the ( semi)leptonic decays of the @xmath30 meson .",
    "let us finally mention that the possibility of intermediate bound states in electromagnetic decays of quarkonia in particular and its physical consequences have been discussed elsewhere @xcite , without resorting to a fock decomposition .    at this point , one may wonder about the possibility of reaching different @xmath25 bound states starting from an initial spin - triplet color - singlet configuration by radiation of soft photons , instead of gluons , via electric and magnetic transitions .",
    "however , the situation is not quite the same as in @xmath2standard  nrqcd . in effect , let us emphasize one of consequences of the the crucial difference between photons and gluons : since the latter carry color , a lower energy bound always applies in soft emission at the final stage hadronization ( corresponding , for instance , to a pion mass ) . on the contrary , no such infrared cut - off exists for photons , except for the experimental detection threshold which properly regularizes the infrared divergences @xcite",
    ". moreover , ( soft ) single gluon emission from quarkonia would leave the heavy quark - antiquark pair in a color - octet state , thereby forbidding its subsequent annihilation into a charged lepton pair",
    ". therefore , soft photon emission in leptonic decays of @xmath0 resonances can have important consequences beyond purely radiative corrections .",
    "in fact , several authors @xcite suggested long time ago that a scalar ( @xmath31 ) higgs of mass near 10 gev could enhance the tauonic decay of the @xmath32 resonance , proposing a close look at the cascade decay with an @xmath33 machine working on the @xmath34 resonance : @xmath35 where the radiative decay corresponds ( mainly ) to an electric dipole ( e1 ) transition .",
    "actually , our underlying idea is not too far from theirs , although now the structural magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition should no lead to a p - wave resonance , but likely to a s - wave pseudoscalar continuum bound state .",
    "indeed , let us note that a e1 transition would involve the product of a @xmath36-wave initial - state function , peaking at the origin , with a @xmath37-wave final - state function , vanishing at the origin ; in the long wavelength limit the overlap should be small .",
    "besides , it seems unrealistic a continuum p - wave @xmath25 state whose mass is smaller than the initial s - wave state mass .",
    "the last argument can be extended to other quantum numbers of the continuum resonance and , consequently , i dismiss all possibilities but a pseudoscalar @xmath25 bound state after photon emission in the process ( 3 ) .    in sum ,",
    "magnetic dipole transitions of the @xmath0 into a non - perturbative @xmath38 $ ] state ( i am using spectroscopic notation and stressing its color - singlet status by keeping the superscript @xmath39 widely used in nrqcd ) can play a noticeable role in a process like ( 3 ) .",
    "the corresponding width can be estimated with the aid of a text - book formula @xcite : @xmath40}\\    { \\simeq}\\ \\frac{16 \\alpha}{3}\\biggl(\\frac{q_b}{2m_b}\\biggr)^2k^3\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the energy of the soft photon @xmath42 , radiated from either the heavy quark or the heavy antiquark inside bottomonium , as shown in figure 1.b ; the mass of the upsilon resonance will be approximately taken as twice the bottom quark mass throughout the paper , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "actually , the above equation should provide just an order - of - magnitude estimate since , for instance , the density of the continuum @xmath44}$ ] states is not taken into account ; but , in reality , the main uncertainty comes from the value used for the soft @xmath2typical  photon energy , i.e. the input @xmath41 in eq.(5 ) .    in this regard , note that typical widths of resonance peaks in @xmath33 machines are of the order of one or few tens of mev for the @xmath0 family below open bottom production ( much larger than resonance widths themselves ) . on the other hand , usual thresholds for photon detection",
    "are of order 50 mev . moreover , in the case of tauonic decays , event selection is based on either semileptonic or hadronic inclusive decays of the @xmath45 s ( usually requiring a @xmath2back - to - back  topology ) with similar ( probably larger ) uncertainties as in the electron or muonic channels , concerning a soft photon escaping detection @xcite .",
    "therefore , letting the photon energy @xmath41 vary over the range @xmath46 mev , one gets from ( 5 ) the interval @xmath47}\\   { \\simeq}\\ 4.3{\\times}10^{-5}-5.4{\\times}10^{-3}$ ] kev .",
    "let us stress that those small @xmath41 values do justify the use of eq.(5 ) for magnetic dipole transitions since the wavelengths of the radiated photons are quite larger than the size of quarkonium ( of order @xmath48 gev@xmath49 ) .",
    "next , dividing the partial width given in eq.(5 ) by the total width of the resonance , @xmath50 kev @xcite , one gets the probability that the m1 transition takes place , i.e. @xmath51}\\   = \\",
    "\\frac{\\gamma^{m1}_{\\upsilon(1s ) { \\rightarrow}\\gamma_sb\\bar{b}[{}^1\\!s_0^{(1 ) } ] } } { \\gamma_{tot}}\\ { \\simeq}\\   \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{tot}}\\ \\frac{4\\alpha q_b^2}{3m_b^2}\\ k^3 \\",
    "\\simeq\\ 8.2{\\cdot}10^{-7}-10^{-4}\\ ] ] the latter quantity can be interpreted as a kind of branching fraction ( bf ) for the radiative decay of the @xmath27 into the supposed continuum @xmath25 spin - singlet resonance , under the experimental constraint of the photon energy upper cut - off .",
    "the range shown in eq.(6 ) seems realistic when compared to the measured bf for the channel @xmath52 , ( of order @xmath53 @xcite ) taking into account the different mass and electric charge for the charm and bottom quarks .",
    "subsequently , the pseudoscalar @xmath38 $ ] state could decay into a charged lepton pair at tree - level via the conjectured neutral boson , as will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "finally let us emphasize that , in this experimental context , soft photons ( mainly radiated by the initial - state colliding electrons in @xmath33 machines and by the final - state outgoing leptons ) are those whose energies do not exceed the experimental detection threshold and thereby can not be observed . nevertheless , as is well - known soft radiation corrections",
    "must be included in the theoretical analysis @xcite for a meaningful comparison with the experimental results for the leptonic branching fraction : @xmath54 . in an analogous fashion ,",
    "photons from the conjectured m1 transition of the @xmath0 resonance would merge with the aforementioned bulk of soft radiation , without changing significantly the invariant mass of the lepton pair ( i.e. within mass reconstruction windows ) , or passing trigger and off - line selection criteria , ultimately contributing to the measured leptonic bf .      in this letter",
    ", we are focusing on vector @xmath9 states of the bottomonium family below open flavor ( i.e. @xmath55 ) state is excluded in the present analysis since only experimental data available for the muonic channel @xcite are currently available ; see http://pdg.lbl.gov for regular updates . ] decaying into a charged lepton pair plus a _ soft _ photon : @xmath56(\\rightarrow   \\phi^0{\\rightarrow}\\ \\ell^+\\ell^-)\\ \\ \\ ; \\   \\ \\ \\ell = e,\\mu,\\tau\\ ] ] where the soft ( i stress it once more : _ unobserved _ ) @xmath42 comes from a _ prompt _",
    "m1 transition of the @xmath0 resonance , as sketched in figure 1.b .",
    "the decay width @xmath57 will be written in a factored form reflecting the two - step process : prior formation of an intermediate ( mainly ) pseudoscalar state of account of soft magnetic radiation , followed by its annihilation into a charged lepton pair mediated by a ( pseudo)scalar higgs : @xmath58 }   \\times \\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\ell\\ell}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the annihilation width of the @xmath38 $ ] state into a lepton pair via @xmath4 higgs exchange .",
    "furthermore , fermions are supposed to couple to the @xmath4 field according to a yukawa interaction term in the effective lagrangian , @xmath60 where @xmath61 gev stands for the vacuum expectation value of the standard higgs boson ; @xmath62 denotes a factor depending on the type of the higgs boson , which could enhance the coupling with a fermion ( quark or lepton ) of type @xmath2@xmath63  .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 couples to the final - state leptons proportionally to their masses , ultimately required because of spin - flip in the interaction of a fermion with a ( pseudo)scalar , expectedly providing an experimental signature for checking the existence of a light higgs in our study .",
    "lastly , note that the @xmath64 matrix stands only in the case of a pseudoscalar @xmath4 field .    in this paper",
    ", i am tentatively assuming that the mass of the sought light higgs stands close to the @xmath65 resonance but below @xmath1 production : @xmath66 .",
    "as will be argued from current experimental data in the next section , i suppose specifically that @xmath67 lies somewhere between the @xmath27 and @xmath34 masses , i.e. @xmath68    now , i define the mass difference : @xmath69 , where @xmath0 denotes either a @xmath70 or a @xmath71 state . accepting for simplicity that the higgs stands halfway between the mass values of both resonances",
    ", i will set @xmath72 gev for an order - of - magnitude calculation .",
    "hence i write approximately for the scalar tree - level propagator of the @xmath4 particle in ( 7 ) , @xmath73 where the width of the higgs boson has been neglected would stand closer than one higgs width , there would be a mixing between both states further enhancing the decay into lepton pairs @xcite , deserving a separate study . ] for it should be very narrow due the smallness of @xmath67 and , moreover , standing below bottom open production according to the inequality ( 10 ) .    performing a comparison between the widths of both leptonic decay processes ( i.e. @xmath59 versus @xmath74 )",
    ", one concludes with the aid of eqs.(9 - 11 ) and ( 1 ) that @xmath75 with @xmath20 defined in eq.(2 ) .",
    "above i used a non - relativistic approximation , ( cp - even ) higgs vanishes and only a @xmath26 ( cp - odd ) higgs couples to pseudoscalar quarkonium in this limit .",
    "therefore , the higgs hunted in this work could be properly denoted by @xmath76 though i will keep using the generic @xmath4 symbol for it , though standing hereafter for a cp - odd higgs .",
    "] assuming the same wave function at the origin for both the @xmath0 vector state and the @xmath38 $ ] intermediate bound state on account of heavy - quark spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , the bf for channel ( 7 ) can be readily obtained from eq.(8 ) , with the help of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 12 ) , as @xmath77   \\times { \\cal b}_{\\ell\\ell}\\ ] ] so one can compare the relative rates by means of the following dimensionless ratio @xmath78   \\times \\frac{m_{\\ell}^2}{{\\delta}m^2}\\ ] ] where we are assuming that the main contribution to the leptonic channel comes from the photon exchange graph of figure 1.a .",
    "let us point out once again that since @xmath42 is undetected , the higgs contribution of figure 1.b would be experimentally ascribed to the leptonic channel of the @xmath0 resonance .    for the sake of a comparison with other higgs searches",
    ", i will identify in the following the @xmath79 factor with the 2hdm ( type ii ) parameter for the universal down - type fermion coupling to a cp - odd higgs , i.e. @xmath80 , defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two higgs fields @xcite . inserting numerical values ,",
    "one gets the interval @xmath81 where use was made of the approximation @xmath82 gev , and the range @xmath46 mev for the soft photon energy @xmath41 ; @xmath83 is expressed in gev .",
    "now , i will confront the above predictions with the experimental results on @xmath0 leptonic decays @xcite summarized in table 1 .",
    "( notice that although those bf s were often determined from raw data under the assumption of lepton universality , its possible small breaking would not alter considerably the final figures . ) indeed , from inspection of table 1 one realizes that experimental data favor a slight but steady increase of the decay rate with the lepton mass in all cases . in spite of that , current error bars ( @xmath84 ) are still too large ( especially in the case of the @xmath34 ) to permit a thorough check of the lepton mass dependence as expressed in ( 15 ) .",
    "nevertheless , i will apply below a hypothesis test in order to draw , if possible , a statistically significant conclusion about lepton universality breaking . to this end ,",
    "i present in table 2 the differences @xmath85 between bf s of distinct channels obtained from table 1 . in order to treat all of them in equal footing ,",
    "such differences are divided by their respective experimental errors @xmath86 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "[ htb ]    .measured leptonic bf s ( @xmath87 ) and error bars ( @xmath84 ) in @xmath88 , of @xmath27 and @xmath27 ( from @xcite ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , we are especially interested in the _ alternative _ hypothesis based on the existence of a light higgs boson enhancing the decay rate as a growing function of the leptonic squared mass , in opposition to the kinematic factor ( 2 ) .",
    "therefore , the _ region of rejection _ of our statistical test should lie only on _ one side _ ( or _ tail _ ) of the @xmath89 variable distribution ( i.e. positive values if @xmath90 ) , in particular above a preassigned _ critical value _ @xcite .",
    "in other words , i will perform a _",
    "one - tailed test _",
    "@xcite using the sample consisting of four independent bf differences between the electronic and the muonic and tauonic channels respectively ( i.e. @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) for both @xmath27 and @xmath34 resonances shown in table 2 .",
    "i will assume that such differences follow a normal probability distribution .",
    "then , the mean of the four @xmath93 values ( @xmath94 ) turns out to be @xmath95 .",
    "next , i define the _ test statistic _ :",
    "@xmath96 , where @xmath97 stands for the number of independent points .",
    "( note that we are dealing with a gaussian of unity variance after dividing all differences by their respective errors . ) now , choosing the _ critical value _ to be @xmath98 , the lepton universality hypothesis [ playing the role of the _ null hypothesis _ in our test , predicting a mean zero ( or slightly less ) value ] can be _ rejected _ at a _ significance level _ of 10@xmath88 since @xmath99 .",
    "certainly , this result alone is not statistically significant enough to make any serious claim about the rejection of the lepton universality hypothesis in this particular process , but points out the interest to investigate further the alternative hypothesis stemming from eq.(15 ) .",
    "on the grounds of the hypothesis test carried out in the previous section , i conclude that current experimental data shown in table 1 are compatible with a ( small ) breaking of lepton universality in @xmath0 leptonic decays at a significance level of @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , there seems to be a slight but measurable increase of the leptonic decay rate , by a @xmath101 factor , from the electronic channel to the tauonic channel , which can be interpreted theoretically following the 2hdm upon a reasonable choice of its parameters .    actually , from eq.(15 )",
    "one obtains that , under the assumption of a higgs boson of mass about 10 gev to explain such a 10@xmath88 enhancement , @xmath102 should roughly lie over the range : @xmath103 depending on the value of @xmath41 , namely from 50 mev to 10 mev , whose limits remain somewhat arbitrary however .",
    "thus a caveat is in order : the above interval is purely indicative as it only takes into account the probability range on the m1 transition estimated according to eq.(5 ) , and not other sources of uncertainty . in this regard",
    "i have not considered , for example , the possible mixing of the cp - odd higgs with the pseudoscalar @xmath25 system stemming from the @xmath0 after photon radiation , which nevertheless could modify notably the properties of the former @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the @xmath102 interval of eq.(16 ) is compatible with the range needed to interpret the @xmath104 muon anomaly in terms of a light cp - odd higgs ( @xmath76 ) resulting from a two - loop calculation @xcite .",
    "calculation @xcite the discrepancy with respect to the sm becomes smaller than initially expected .",
    "still the situation is under close scrutiny ( see , for example , @xcite ) . ] in this regard , other authors considered a cp - even higgs ( @xmath31 ) in a one - loop calculation @xcite also yielding parametric values very close to ours ; nevertheless , note that the possibility of a scalar higgs , contributing to the @xmath0 leptonic decay as conjectured in this work , was discarded in our study since the corresponding partial width vanishes in the ( leading ) static approximation for the @xmath38 $ ] intermediate state .    in summary ,",
    "i have pointed out in this letter a possible breaking of lepton universality in @xmath0 leptonic decays , interpreted in terms of a neutral cp - odd higgs of mass around @xmath105 gev , introducing a @xmath106 dependent contribution in the partial width .",
    "( notice that higher - order corrections within the sm can not imply such a quadratic dependence on the leptonic mass . )",
    "pictorially , one could say that the higgs is @xmath2hidden  in part because the ( undetected ) m1 photon , stemming from the assumed prompt structural transition , merges with the bulk of soft photon radiation incorporated into the very definition of the leptonic bf @xcite .",
    "i end by emphasizing the interest in more accurate data on leptonic bf s of @xmath0 resonances , particularly considering the exciting possibility of a signal of new physics as pointed out in this work .",
    "hopefully , b factories working below open bottom production will provide in a near future new and likely more precise measurements of the leptonic bf s for the @xmath0 family , perhaps requiring specific dedicated data - taking periods if a light cp - odd higgs discovery strategy would be conducted including a complementary search for a cp - even higgs in accordance with the process ( 4 ) .",
