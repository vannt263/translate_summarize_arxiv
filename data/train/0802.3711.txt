    "rsoph is a symbiotic recurrent nova , in which a high - mass white dwarf ( wd ) accretes material from a cool k7iii giant on a 456-day orbit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "historically , 6 eruptions have been recorded unambiguously . the first one in 1898 and the last one on 2006 february 12.83 @xcite .",
    "the recurrence period of approximately 20 years and a bright peak magnitude , @xmath9 , made rsoph a good target for multifrequency observational campaigns from the beginning of its recent , 1985 and 2006 , outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for example , they revealed a non - spherical shaping of the nova ejecta : ( i ) on the radio map ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , ( ii ) by interferometric technique in the near infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and also ( iii ) by the hst imaging in the optical @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we present evidences of the non - spherical mass outflow on the basis of the optical spectroscopy of rsoph carried out from the first days of its 2006 outburst to the post - outburst quiet phase .",
    "the h@xmath0  profile from day 1.38 consisted of a very broad component , triangular in profile , with @xmath10kms@xmath6 , a narrow emission component ( @xmath11kms@xmath6 ) cut with a sharp absorption at @xmath12kms@xmath6  and a blueward - shifted absorption component at @xmath13kms@xmath6  ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we suggest that the broad triangular profile is due to kinematics of the photoionized and optically thin stellar wind from the wd .",
    "the narrow central absorption / emission components then could represent result of the radiative transfer in h@xmath0  through the optically thick fraction of the wind at the vicinity of the wd surface .",
    "the violet - shifted absorption could be associated with a dense material of the neutral wind from the giant swept off by the fast wind from the wd and accumulated into a shell at the front of the ejecta .",
    "we tested the origin of the broad triangular component by the bipolar wind model as proposed by @xcite . in this model a fraction of the wind from the central star is blocked by the disk at / around the wd s equator , which thus creates bipolar geometry of the stellar wind .",
    "according to the model sed from the quiet phase @xcite we adopted the disk radius @xmath14 and the disk thickness at its edge , @xmath15 . the resulting synthetic profile ( fig .",
    "1 , left ) corresponds to the terminal velocity @xmath16kms@xmath6 , the acceleration parameter @xmath17 and the mass loss rate through the wind , @xmath18@xmath3 .",
    "the small value of @xmath19 reflects a very high acceleration of the wind particles ( fig .  1",
    ", right ) .",
    "here we present examples of h@xmath0  line profiles we measured at day 12.4 and 15.3 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "similar profile could still be recognized at day 28.3 ( 13/03/2006 ) .",
    "the whole profile was shifted to the red part of the spectrum by @xmath21150kms@xmath6 .",
    "the main emission core was triangular in profile with the peak 7080 times the continuum and the base of @xmath22kms@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the profile showed emission shoulders located bipolarly at @xmath7kms@xmath6 , expanding to @xmath23kms@xmath6(fig .  2 ) .",
    "radial velocities of both the triangular emission core and the faint satellite components in the h@xmath0  profile were very similar to those indicated by the amber / vlti interferometric observations at day 5.5 @xcite : a slow expanding ring - like structure with @xmath24kms@xmath6and a fast structure ( @xmath25kms@xmath6 ) in the direction that coincides with the jet - like feature seen in the radio .",
    "accordingly , the triangular h@xmath0  emission core could be associated with an expanding ring at the equatorial plane of the wd and the satellite components with bipolar jets ejected at / around the accretor .",
    "the latter , however , requires the presence of the inner disk , through which sufficient amount of mass is accreted to balance the outflow via the jets ( note that @xmath26 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  3 shows h@xmath0  line profiles carried out at day 57 ( 10/04/2006 ) and 209 ( 09/09/2006 ) compared with synthetic profiles of the bipolar wind we introduced in sect .  2 .",
    "in the earlier case ( left panel ) the wind model fits only the very extended wings ( @xmath27kms@xmath6 ) of the observed profile .",
    "the model corresponds to @xmath28kms@xmath6 , @xmath29 and the mass loss rate , @xmath30@xmath3   for @xmath31kpc .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the line core does not obey the @xmath19-wind velocity law .",
    "the @xmath32kms@xmath6  is too large to be fitted by the wind .",
    "this reflects the presence of a bipolarly located emission within @xmath33kms@xmath6  having probable cause in the expanding and diluting ring - like structure as discussed in sect .",
    "at day 209 the h@xmath0  flux decreased by a factor of @xmath2120 and the profile became to be narrow ( @xmath34kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the model fits well the profile for @xmath35kms@xmath6 , but isolates an emission bump in the red wing .",
    "we interpret this feature as a result of a sporadic clumpy ejection from the accretor due to abrupt accretion from the re - creating large disk during the quiet phase ( c.f .",
