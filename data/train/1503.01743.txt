    "asteroid ( 185851 ) 2000 dp107 was discovered on 2000 february 29 by the lincoln near - earth asteroid research ( linear ) program in new mexico .",
    "radar observations in october of that year revealed the asteroid to be a binary system  @xcite , the first such system to be imaged in the near - earth asteroid ( nea ) population .",
    "the radar data were instrumental in establishing that nea satellites form by a spin - up and rotational fission process  @xcite .",
    "additional radar and photometric studies showed that @xmath14 of all neas larger than 200  m are binary in nature  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the properties of binary asteroids , see  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a satellite around the primary gives us an opportunity to secure direct measurements of several quantities that are not normally measurable .",
    "radar observations enable calculations of the orbital period and orbital separation , which reveal the total mass of the binary system through kepler s third law . in addition ,",
    "radar observations enable measurements of the masses of individual components by measuring the distances of the component centers of mass ( coms ) from the system com . using this information along with the shape models of the two components derived from radar images , we can estimate their densities .",
    "these are important constraints for testing models of formation and evolution of neas .",
    "radar observations of 2000 dp107 in 2000 october yielded rough estimates of masses , sizes , and densities of the two components as well as their mutual orbit  @xcite . in 2008 september ,",
    "the asteroid made another close approach to the earth and was observed at a distance @xmath15 astronomical units ( au ) or about 20 lunar distances . because this was about half the distance of the 2000 encounter ( @xmath16  au )",
    ", it resulted in data sets with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath17 times higher than in 2000 .",
    "the high snrs enabled us to derive component shapes with effective resolutions of @xmath18  m on the surface , and estimate the component masses , volumes , and densities more accurately than was possible in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present detailed component shape models , improved estimates of component masses and densities , and estimates of the mutual orbit parameters using the 2000 and the 2008 radar data .",
    "this detailed characterization of 2000 dp107 and its favorable accessibility ( @xmath19 km s@xmath20 ) make it a good candidate for spacecraft rendezvous missions .",
    "2000 dp107 was the target of the procyon mission  @xcite , which had a planned flyby the asteroid in 2016 .",
    "however the mission suffered an engine failure and will be unable to perform the flyby .",
    "we observed 2000 dp107 using the arecibo s - band ( 2380 mhz , 13 cm ) radar and the goldstone x - band ( 8560 mhz , 3.5 cm ) radar on 10 days between 2008 september 9 and 24 , during which the asteroid moved @xmath21 across the sky .",
    "it came closest to earth on september 11 at a distance of 0.057  au .",
    "most of the observing time was dedicated to range - doppler imaging , with the remainder dedicated to collecting continuous wave ( cw ) spectra .",
    "we obtained 335 range - doppler images and 65 cw spectra using arecibo and 534 range - doppler images and 67 cw spectra using goldstone .",
    "radar observations were carried out according to the methods described in @xcite . briefly , radar imaging was carried out by transmitting a repeating pseudo - random code modulated over a circularly polarized carrier wave , using a binary phase shift keying scheme  @xcite . in each",
    "_ run _ , the waveform was transmitted for approximately the round - trip light - time ( rtt ) before switching over to the receiver .",
    "the received signal was demodulated and then decoded by cross - correlating it with a replica of the transmitted code , yielding a range resolution equal to the baud length of the transmitted code . in each range bin ,",
    "consecutive returns were fast fourier transformed ( fft ) to obtain the received signal power as a function of doppler frequency .",
    "the end product is a two - dimensional array or image showing the echo power as a function of range and doppler frequency .",
    "technically , the observable measured at the telescope is the round - trip light time to the target .",
    "we obtained range bins by multiplying the baud length of the code by half the speed of light .    for cw runs ,",
    "a monochromatic wave was transmitted for the rtt to the asteroid before switching over to the receiver .",
    "the received signal was demodulated , sampled , and recorded .",
    "a fft was applied to the echo timeseries to obtain the cw spectra .",
    "table  [ tab : observingsummary ] summarizes our observations . because of the smaller antenna size and transmitter power , the goldstone data have much lower snrs ( @xmath22 ) compared to the arecibo data .",
    "six to eight consecutive goldstone runs were summed incoherently in order to improve the snr .",

    "we used data from 2000 october and 2008 september , and initialized the fitting procedure with thousands of distinct initial conditions spanning the entire range of plausible values for all orbital parameters .",
    "from the 2000 data , we selected 2 - 4 images on each day from september 30 to october 7 , or 20 measurement epochs spanning 8 days , yielding 20 range separations and 20 doppler separations . for the 2008 data set , we measured the component com separations in 10 arecibo images on each day of arecibo observations , and in 6 , 3 , 6 , 2 , and 8 goldstone images on september 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 respectively , giving us a total of 95 measurement epochs spanning 16 days , or 190 measurements ( 95 range separations and 95 doppler separations ) .",
    "we obtained range - doppler separations between the primary and secondary coms using two different techniques . in the first approach we estimated the com locations in the images by measuring the positions of the leading and trailing edges of the components . in the second approach we relied on shape models obtained with the shape software  @xcite to locate the component coms .",
    "if the shape models are accurate , the second technique can yield superior estimates of the com positions , and therefore of the mutual orbit parameters .",
    "sections  [ sec : primshape ] and  [ sec : secshape ] describe shape modeling details .    for the first , edge - based approach",
    ", we defined leading edges ( le ) and trailing edges ( te ) in the images on the basis of a 3@xmath25 signal threshold , where @xmath25 is the standard deviation of the background noise .",
    "the le was defined as the first range bin where the object had a signal higher than 3@xmath25 whereas the te was defined as the last range bin where at least half of the pixels along the doppler extent exceeded the 3@xmath25 threshold .",
    "the location of this threshold depends on doppler resolution ( shown in table  [ tab : observingsummary ] ) .",
    "the primary and secondary were assumed to be roughly spherical and their radii were estimated from radar images to be roughly 450  m and 150  m respectively . with these assumptions the range coordinates of the component coms were taken to be 450  m and 150  m behind their respective leading edges .",
    "the doppler coordinates of the coms were assumed to be located in the middle of the doppler extent on the trailing edge .",
    "conservative uncertainties of 2 - 3 times the range and doppler resolutions were assigned to the range - doppler separations .",
    "for the second , shape - based approach , we used the shape modeling software to locate the component coms under a uniform density assumption .",
    "shape aligns the synthetic radar images derived from the shape models with the observed radar images , and outputs the com positions used for the alignment with sub - pixel precision .",
    "uncertainties on the order of the image resolution were assigned to the shape - based range and doppler separations .",
    "we computed the com separations at the same epochs as those used in the edge - based approach .",
    "we fit the mutual orbit and component shapes in an iterative manner .",
    "each iteration started with mutual orbit fitting followed by component shape modeling .",
    "in the first iteration , we used the edge - based approach to determine the preliminary mutual orbit and used the orbit solution ( orbit pole and longitude of pericenter ) to inform our component shape modeling ( sections [ sec : primshape ] and [ sec : secshape ] ) .",
    "for the second iteration , the best - fit component shapes from the first iteration were used to refine the com separation estimates using the shape - based approach .",
    "these improved primary - secondary separation estimates were used to refine the mutual orbit fit .",
    "the refined mutual orbit solution was used to obtain the final shape models of the components .",
    "we used the shape software  @xcite to invert the sequence of range - doppler images and cw spectra from 2008 to obtain a 3d shape model for the primary .",
    "our data set consisted of 278 arecibo range - doppler images and 95 cw spectra from both arecibo and goldstone covering a 16-day period between 2008 september 9 and 24 .",
    "we left out the low - resolution arecibo images from september 24 and all the goldstone images as they did not improve the quality of the fit and slowed down the shape modeling process . because we modeled the primary and secondary",
    "separately , we edited the images and spectra to exclude the contribution of the other component to the echoes .",
    "shape modeling was generally carried out in three steps .",
    "first we fit a triaxial ellipsoid model to the data to get the overall extents of the object .",
    "we then moved on to a 8th - degree - and - order spherical harmonics model to fit for the global - scale topography seen in the images .",
    "finally , in order to fit for the small - scale features , we used a vertex model with 1000 vertices and 1996 triangular facets .",
    "this choice yields a facet resolution of @xmath18  m , which is comparable to the best range resolution . in each step",
    "weighted penalty functions were used to favor models having uniform density , principal axis rotation , and a reasonably smooth surface .",
    "we used a cosine law to model the radar scattering from the surface of the asteroid : @xmath26 here @xmath25 is the radar cross section , @xmath27 is the target surface area , @xmath28 is the fresnel reflectivity , @xmath29 is a parameter related to the near - surface roughness of the asteroid at the radar wavelength scales , and @xmath30 is the incidence angle of the wave .",
    "values of @xmath29 close to 1 represent diffuse scattering , whereas larger values represent more specular scattering  @xcite .",
    "because non - linear least - squares methods tend to find local minima when searching a wide parameter space , we carried out an extensive grid search for the best - fit spin axis orientation during the ellipsoid and spherical harmonics shape modeling stages .",
    "we assumed that the lightcurve period of 2.775 h  @xcite provided a good approximation to the sidereal spin period and we fit shape models to the data using spin axis orientations in increments of 15@xmath31 in ecliptic longitude ( @xmath32 ) and 15@xmath31 in ecliptic latitude ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "for each case , we performed an ellipsoid model fit followed by a 8-degree spherical harmonics model fit . only the shape parameters , semi - axes in the ellipsoid fit and spherical harmonic coefficients in the spherical harmonic fit",
    ", the initial rotational phase of the object , and the radar scattering parameter @xmath28 were allowed to change .",
    "the spin rate , the spin axis orientation , and the radar scattering parameter @xmath29 were kept fixed .",
    "the grid search was repeated for @xmath29=0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , and 1.2 .",
    "we defined a somewhat arbitrary threshold separating acceptable fits from poorer solutions by visually comparing the synthetic and observed images and using a @xmath34 threshold of 0.665 .",
    "our mutual orbit pole estimates lie in the region where spin axis orientations were considered acceptable on the basis of the shape model fits .",
    "because we did not obtain a tight constraint on our spin pole using the shape model search ( section  [ sec : rprimshape ] ) , we used the best - fit mutual orbit pole as the preferred spin pole for shape modeling . for",
    "a binary formed by a spin - up process one would expect the primary spin pole to be roughly aligned with the mutual orbit pole , and tidal processes are expected to damp any residual inclination . with this spin pole assumption",
    "we fit 8th - degree - and - order spherical harmonics models to the data in the same way as we did in the grid search . here",
    "we tried values of sidereal spin rate ranging from 3111  @xmath31/day ( @xmath35  h ) to 3117  @xmath31/day ( @xmath36  h ) in steps of 0.2  @xmath31/day and values of @xmath29 ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : mutualorbit ] , the shape modeling was done iteratively with the mutual orbit fits : mutual orbit fits were followed by shape model fits . in the second / final iteration",
    ", we performed the spherical harmonics shape model fit followed by a vertex model fit . at each step",
    ", we verified the quality of the fit by visually comparing the synthetic data generated by shape with the corresponding observed data . for the vertex model fit we used as initial conditions the best - fit spin state and spherical harmonics shape model determined at the previous step .",
    "once again , only the shape parameters ( location of the vertices ) , the initial rotational phase , and the radar scattering parameter @xmath28 were allowed to change and all the other parameters were kept fixed .",
    "shape modeling of the secondary component was performed using a method similar to the one described in section  [ sec : primshape ] .",
    "the data set for modeling the shape and rotation of the secondary consisted of 180 arecibo images taken between 2008 september 10 and 15 .",
    "we left out images with 75  m range resolution from september 18 and 21 because the secondary was barely resolved in these images , and because these images did not improve the quality of the shape model fits .",
    "this time it was the primary that was edited out of the images .",
    "the cw spectra were not used because we were not able to completely remove the contribution of the primary from the total echo power .",
    "we fit an ovoid shape model , followed by a 5th - degree - and - order spherical harmonic model .",
    "we then fit a vertex model with 150 vertices and 296 facets .",
    "periodicities detected in photometric data suggest that the secondary spin period may be close to 1.76 days  @xcite .",
    "this can be used as a guide in our shape modeling process , being mindful that lightcurve periods are neither sidereal nor synodic , whereas the shape software uses sidereal spin periods .",
    "this periodicity is close to the 1.7556 day orbital period ( table  [ tab : mutualorbit ] ) , confirming the finding that the secondary is locked in a 1:1 spin - orbit resonance  @xcite .",
    "we used the radar - derived , sidereal orbital period as the nominal spin period of the secondary for the purpose of shape modeling .",
    "as with the primary , a grid search did not lead to a conclusive result about the spin axis orientation .",
    "absent recent perturbations , one expects the spin pole of a tidally evolved secondary to be closely aligned with the mutual orbit pole , and we used the mutual orbit pole as the spin pole of the secondary .",
    "this proximity to the orbit pole can be verified by computing the obliquity of cassini state 1  @xcite , which is the state towards which tides drive the satellite spin pole .",
    "the other cassini states are either unstable or the spin of satellite is unstable at those cassini states @xcite .",
    "the obliquity can be computed by using the following equation derived from @xcite for a synchronous secondary : @xmath37 = \\big(\\frac{\\dot\\omega}{\\omega}\\big ) .",

    "the secondary shapes were fit ( sections  [ sec : rmutualorb ] ,  [ sec : rprimshape ] , and [ sec : rsecshape ] ) , we evaluated equation  [ eq : cassini_prec ] with the relevant values and found that @xmath43 , confirming that the expected obliquity is small .",
    "the initial rotation phase was set to a value such that the secondary was oriented with its minimum moment of inertia ( moi ) principal axis pointing towards the primary at pericenter .",
    "this is the expected configuration of a tidally locked satellite .",
    "the same radar scattering law as the one used for the primary was used .",
    "we allowed the shape parameters and the radar scattering parameter @xmath28 to change .",
    "the spin rate , the spin axis orientation , and the radar scattering parameter @xmath29 were kept fixed . during the ovoid model stage , we attempted shape model fits with values of spin period ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 days in steps of 0.01 days .",
    "an elongated and synchronous secondary in an eccentric orbit about the primary exhibits librations , which are oscillations about uniform rotation  ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "a tidally evolved satellite is expected to exhibit a relaxed - mode libration  @xcite , which is equivalent to a forced libration  @xcite when the spin - orbit coupling is negligible .",
    "this libration is roughly sinusoidal for small eccentricities and its amplitude as a function of the satellite elongation was estimated by @xcite using numerical simulations .    because the mutual orbit is eccentric ( @xmath44 ) and the secondary is elongated ( sections  [ sec : rmutualorb ] and [ sec : rsecshape ] ) , we allowed for the possibility of relaxed - mode libration in longitude in the rotational model . for small amplitudes of forced librations and small orbital eccentricities , the deviation of the secondary orientation from regular circular motion ( @xmath45 )",

    "the additional phase of @xmath51 appears because for a synchronous secondary whose natural libration frequency is smaller than the forcing frequency , the librational phase is expected to be @xmath52 at pericenter  @xcite .",
    "we repeated the ovoid and spherical harmonics shape model fits with libration amplitudes ranging from 0@xmath31 to 10@xmath31 in steps of @xmath53 .",
    "we tried all possible libration phases in steps of @xmath54 in order to cover the libration phase uncertainty which arises due to an almost circular orbit .",
    "the libration amplitudes and phases were held at fixed values in each of these fits .",
    "results of the secondary shape and spin state modeling are discussed in section  [ sec : rsecshape ] .",
    "we transmitted circularly polarized waves and used two separate channels to receive echoes with the same circular ( sc ) and opposite circular ( oc ) polarization as that of the transmitted wave @xcite .",
    "we summed consecutive arecibo cw runs from 2008 ( table  [ tab : observingsummary ] ) and measured the power received in the oc and sc channels .",
    "the ratio of the power received in sc to the power received in oc yields the circular polarization ratio which is often denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "we also used equation 1 of @xcite to compute the radar cross - section of the target , which has dimension of surface area .",
    "we computed the dimensionless _ specific radar cross - section _ ( @xmath56 ) , also called the _",
    "radar albedo _ , with the oc cw spectra by taking the ratio of the radar cross - section to the geometric cross - sectional area of the target ( primary + secondary ) at the time of observations .",
    "we used shape to compute the orientations of the target and corresponding projected areas at the times of cw runs .",
    "the procedure described in the previous paragraph yielded values of @xmath56 and @xmath55 that combine the echoes from both the primary and secondary .",
    "we were also interested in estimates of these quantities for the secondary component alone .",
    "we obtained these by removing the contribution of the primary from the oc cw spectra .",
    "this subtraction was performed by fitting a 5th degree polynomial to the primary cw spectra and by masking out the frequency bins that contained contribution from the secondary .",
    "after subtraction , we estimated @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the secondary using the same procedure as that described in the previous paragraph .",
    "results are given in section  [ sec : rradarscat ] .",
    "the coms of the two components follow roughly keplerian orbits around the system com , while the system com or barycenter orbits the sun .",
    "the motion of the primary com relative to the system com is called the reflex motion of the primary .",
    "we estimated the mass ratio of the components and the reflex motion of the primary by quantifying the goodness of fit of heliocentric orbit fits using astrometry of the system com under various mass ratio assumptions .",
    "the system com lies on the line joining the component coms at a distance of @xmath58 from the primary and a distance of @xmath59 from the secondary .",
    "the ratio of these distances ( @xmath60 ) is equal to the primary - to - secondary mass ratio ( @xmath61 ) . for a given mass ratio assumption , we calculated the ratio @xmath60 and estimated the barycenter locations along the lines joining the component coms in each of the 278 images obtained in 2008 that were used for shape modeling .",

    "the shape and the gravitational field provide clues about the mechanical properties of the material of the primary .",
    "figure  [ fig : slopes ] shows that the gravitational slopes around the mid - latitudes are mostly between 40@xmath31 and 65@xmath31 .",
    "some of these values are greater than the angle of repose of sand on earth which has values between 30@xmath31 and 50@xmath31 .",
    "a possible explanation of such high angles is that cohesive van der waals forces between the particles play an important role on the surfaces of the asteroids as proposed by  @xcite .",
    "these cohesive forces could be comparable in magnitude to the ambient gravitational force  @xcite , resulting in much higher effective angles of repose ( @xmath106 ) that the material can sustain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : slopes ] shows that slopes at the equator of the primary are @xmath107 , implying that centrifugal force is greater than the gravitational pull at the equator . in the absence of other forces , this imbalance will cause material to escape from the primary at the equator .",
    "cohesion between particles could balance the excess centrifugal force and prevent such an escape .",
    "nevertheless , the regions in the mid - latitudes having high slopes might be devoid of fine grained material , as the material would slide off to lower potential areas .",
    "some of the regions on the equatorial ridge with slopes close to 180@xmath31 might also be paths through which material is shed off from the primary .",
    "the slope values are sensitive to the size , the density , and the spin period of the asteroid . scaling down the asteroid by @xmath108 and keeping the mass unchanged ( effectively increasing its density by @xmath109 , which is within the density uncertainty ) yields slopes close to zero on most regions at the equator and slopes lower than @xmath110 on most of the surface of the asteroid .",
    "if tides and/or yorp spin down the asteroid , there will be a global decrease in the slopes .",
    "a similar spin down might have led to the overall low slopes seen on 2008  ev5  @xcite .    assuming a grain density of 3000  kg  m@xmath5 , which would be appropriate for an s - type asteroid , the observed densities of the primary and secondary",

    "the equatorial ridge has an approximately 300  m concavity on it .",
    "the concavity could just be a void left over after the asteroid attained its current shape or it could be an impact crater .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that a secondary fission event can take place during the post - fission dynamics following the binary formation process , and that one of the fragments may impact the primary .",
    "secondary fission refers to the rotational fission of the secondary as it is torqued by spin - orbit coupling while in a chaotic rotation state  @xcite .",
    "gravitational pull dominates the centrifugal force in the interior of the concavity , so ponding of fine grained material transported from higher latitudes can be expected inside the crater .",
    "the eccentricity of the mutual orbit , @xmath113 , translates to a variation of the primary - secondary distance of @xmath114  m during each orbit . while this variation is detectable in the radar data from 2008 , which has a range resolution of @xmath115  m ,",
    "it is barely detectable in the radar data obtained in 2000 , which has a range resolution of 75  m. our determination of the longitude of pericenter therefore relies on the 2008 data only .",
    "although we were not able to fit an orbital precession rate , our method does not rule out substantial pericenter precession during 2000 - 2008 .",
    "we performed numerical simulations using the method developed by @xcite to estimate pericenter precession rates under various gravitational perturbations : the non - spherical mass distribution of the primary causes pericenter precession of about @xmath116/year , whereas the non - spherical mass distribution of the secondary contributes about @xmath117/year .",
    "the combined effect causes the pericenter to precess by about @xmath118/year in a prograde direction with respect to the mutual orbit . additionally , the gravitational perturbations from the sun cause the pericenter to precess by about @xmath119/year . the combined effect of these three gravitational perturbations is a secular apsidal precession rate of about @xmath120/year , but there are significant short - term variations in the precession rate , making detection of apsidal precession difficult .",
    "gravitational perturbations from planets and radiative forces from the sun complicate the dynamics further .",
    "the mutual orbit normal ( and the assumed primary and secondary spin poles ) is separated by about 5@xmath31 from the heliocentric orbit normal , which is common among binary neas and possibly indicative of yorp obliquity evolution @xcite .",
    "binary yorp is a radiative torque which is hypothesized to alter the mutual orbit of synchronous binary systems  @xcite .",
    "a synchronous satellite has a fixed leading and trailing side with respect to the direction of its orbital motion , so an asymmetric re - radiation from the surface of the satellite will lead to a net torque on the mutual orbit .",
    "a potentially observable signature of such a torqued orbit is a quadratic change in the mean anomaly of the satellite  @xcite .",
    "detecting a quadratic change in mean anomaly requires measurements of the mean anomaly on a minimum of 3 widely separated epochs .",
    "additional measurements will be required to model the complicated dynamics described in the previous section .",
    "2000  dp107 is a prime candidate for the detection of binary yorp since it presents repeated opportunities for observations and has already been observed in 2000 and 2008 by radar and in 2000 , 2008 , 2011 , and 2013 by optical telescopes .",
    "@xcite made a mean anomaly drift rate prediction for 2000  dp107 by scaling the results obtained from the radar - derived shape model of the satellite of 1999  kw4 .",
    "those predictions can now be updated using the secondary shape model .",
    "depending on the direction of the binary yorp torque , the mutual orbit could either expand , contract , or remain unchanged .",
    "the outcomes of these scenarios were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "an expanding mutual orbit could lead to the formation of asteroid pairs or an asynchronous satellite , whereas a contracting mutual orbit could create a contact binary asteroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a contracting binary yorp torque could also be balanced by an equal and opposite tidal torque implying a binary asteroid in a stable equilibrium as hypothesized by @xcite . future observations of this system may provide a detection of binary yorp evolution .",

    "2000  dp107 has a separation @xmath126 that is larger than most known binary neas and a low eccentricity of 0.019 , resulting in @xmath127 .",
    "this is much larger than is necessary for spin fission . in a tides - only model ,",
    "this large separation implies a rather weak primary , an old age compared to the dynamical lifetime of neas , or the influence of another mechanism such as binary yorp and/or yorp for increasing the total angular momentum  @xcite .",

    "<S> potentially hazardous asteroid ( 185851 ) 2000 dp107 was the first binary near - earth asteroid to be imaged . </S>",
    "<S> radar observations in 2000 provided images at 75  m resolution that revealed the shape , orbit , and spin - up formation mechanism of the binary . </S>",
    "<S> the asteroid made a more favorable flyby of the earth in 2008 , yielding images at 30  m resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we used these data to obtain shape models for the two components and to improve the estimates of the mutual orbit , component masses , and spin periods . </S>",
    "<S> the primary has a sidereal spin period of @xmath0 h and is roughly spheroidal with an equivalent diameter of @xmath1  m @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it has a mass of @xmath3  kg and a density of @xmath4  kg  m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits an equatorial ridge similar to the ( 66391 ) 1999  kw4 primary , however the equatorial ridge in this case is not as regular and has a @xmath6  m diameter concavity on one side . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary has a sidereal spin period of 1.77 @xmath7 0.02 days commensurate with the orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary is slightly elongated and has overall dimensions of @xmath8  m ( 6% uncertainties ) . </S>",
    "<S> its mass is @xmath9  kg and its density is @xmath10  kg  m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the mutual orbit has a semi - major axis of @xmath11  km , an eccentricity of @xmath12 , and a period of @xmath13 days . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized total angular momentum of this system exceeds the amount required for the expected spin - up formation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> an increase of angular momentum from non - gravitational forces after binary formation is a possible explanation . </S>",
    "<S> the two components have similar radar reflectivity , suggesting a similar composition consistent with formation by spin - up . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary appears to exhibit a larger circular polarization ratio than the primary , suggesting a rougher surface or subsurface at radar wavelength scales .    </S>",
