    "in physics there is a large class of problems that can be described in terms of a single quantum mechanical degree of freedom interacting with an environment .",
    "examples range from magnetic impurities in metals , superconductors , and magnets , macroscopic quantum tunneling in superconducting interference devices ( squids ) and molecular magnets @xcite , to qubits in quantum computers @xcite .",
    "the common thread between all these problems is the dramatic effect that the dissipation has on the quantum dynamics of the impurity@xcite . in particular ,",
    "one of the most important effects of an environment on a quantum system is decoherence , that is , the destruction of quantum mechanical effects .",
    "decoherence is the unavoidable consequence of the fact that no system in nature is really isolated .",
    "impurity problems can be often reduced to an effective one - dimensional boundary problem that allows the use of powerful non - perturbative theoretical techniques .",
    "the kondo model is probably one of the best known impurity problems and has been studied with a large number of theoretical tools , from the exact solution via bethe ansatz @xcite , numerical renormalization group @xcite , to conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the kondo problem represents a universality class of open quantum systems where dissipation and decoherence play a fundamental role . in its anisotropic form",
    ", the kondo effect can be mapped via dimensional reduction and abelian bosonization to the ohmic dissipative two - level system ( dtls ) problem@xcite .",
    "the kondo effect can be thought as a situation where decoherence is extreme , in the sense that the spin is completely screened by the environmental excitations in the formation of the so - called kondo singlet .",
    "moreover , impurities can be used as probes for the understanding of the environment itself and in some cases can even determine the properties of the environment in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this occurs in the case of the dynamical mean - field theories ( dmft ) where the solution of a many - body problem reduces to the solution of a self - consistent impurity problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , systems where the competition between different phases of matter lead to the appearance of magnetic inhomogeneities ( such as in the case of griffiths - mccoy singularities in heavy fermion alloys ) can many times be reduced to effective impurity problems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to describe a model for open quantum systems that can not be described within the kondo universality class .",
    "this model describes an effect that we call frustration of decoherence where decoherence is reduced by a pure quantum mechanical effect .",
    "it is important , therefore , that one understands the physics behind the standard model of dissipation described by the kondo or the dtls and how it relates to the problem of decoherence .",
    "since the connection between the kondo problem and decoherence is not commonly discussed in the literature we will review some of the key features of the dtls and its connection with the problem of decoherence .",
    "the dtls can be described as a single spin half , @xmath0 , coupled to a set of independent harmonic oscillators via the hamiltonian ( we use units such that @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the tunnel splitting between the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the coupling to an environment of bosons with one - dimensional momentum @xmath6 , and energy dispersion @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the velocity of the excitations that we set to unity , @xmath9 , from now on ) and creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ( @xmath12 is the linear size of the system ) . the operators obey canonical commutation relations : @xmath13 & = & \\delta_{k , k ' }   \\nonumber   \\\\",
    "\\left [ s_{i } , s_{j } \\right ] & = & i \\epsilon_{ijk } s_{k }   \\label{comrel } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the levi - civita antisymmetric tensor . in this model",
    "one assumes a cut - off energy @xmath15 , where @xmath15 is some non - universal quantity that is associated with microscopic properties of the bath ( @xmath15 is usually proportional to the inverse of the lattice spacing @xmath16 ) .",
    "the physics described by hamiltonian ( [ eq : dtls ] ) can be summarize as follows .",
    "when @xmath17 is decoupled from the environment ( @xmath18 ) one has an isolated spin problem in the presence of a `` magnetic field '' proportional to @xmath3 . if at certain time @xmath19 the spin is prepared in an eigenstate of @xmath4 , the `` magnetic field '' induces transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath20 and the expectation value of the operator @xmath20 , namely , @xmath21 , oscillates harmonically with frequency @xmath3 .",
    "there is no release mechanism for the energy in the spin . by switching on a small coupling to the bath of oscillators ,",
    "the harmonic oscillations of @xmath21 become underdamped due to the dissipation .",
    "second order perturbation theory indicates that the behavior of the system depends on a dimensionless coupling @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
    "there are two main effects @xcite : the slow modes of the bath , that can not follow the motion of the spin , lead to damping and therefore to an exponential decay of @xmath21 ; the fast modes of the bath , that can follow the motion of the spin , lead to a new renormalized oscillation frequency @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 there is a crossover to an overdamped regime where oscillations disappear ( effectively @xmath26 ) and only exponential decay occurs .",
    "finally , at @xmath27 there is a true quantum `` phase transition '' , where the the impurity spin becomes localized in one of the eigenstates of @xmath4 . in the kondo language",
    "the change from delocalized to localized is equivalent to a kosterlitz - thouless transition ( kt ) between the kondo problem with ferromagnetic coupling ( that has a triplet ground state ) and the kondo problem with antiferromagnetic coupling ( with a singlet as ground state ) .",
    "one of the most illuminating ways to describe the kt transition is via a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculation in leading order in @xmath28 .",
    "the rg proceeds in two steps .",
    "in the first step one reduces the cut - off energy of the bosonic bath from @xmath15 to @xmath29 by tracing out high energy degrees of freedom . in a second step",
    "the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 are rescaled to the new cut - off leading to the rg equations@xcite :    [ kt ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 .",
    "thus , for @xmath34 the system scales under the rg to weak coupling ( @xmath35 ) , and at low energies the tunneling splitting @xmath36 scales towards zero leading to localization .",
    "conversely , for @xmath37 the couplings scales towards strong coupling ( @xmath38 ) indicating that rg breaks down .",
    "the renormalization scheme fails at a certain energy scale ( that is , the value of @xmath39 for which @xmath40 ) .",
    "this characteristic scale is called the kondo temperature that can be obtained directly from ( [ kt ] ) as : @xmath41 . in the kondo problem , for frequencies and temperatures below @xmath42 there is no reminiscence of the original impurity spin .",
    "this is an extreme example of decoherence .",
    "although the rg equations clearly captures the asymptotic behavior of the spin dynamics , in order to observe the cross - over from underdamping to overdamping , one has to look at the frequency and temperature dependence of the spin correlation functions .",
    "this is even more important in the context of decoherence , since we are interested in measuring observables associated with the local degrees of freedom , not with the environment . in a spin problem ,",
    "a particular apropos object is the impurity transverse susceptibility that is given by : @xmath43\\rangle\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : xi - trans } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the imaginary part of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is a measure of the amount of energy that is dissipated from the spin into the environment . in the absence of coupling to the environment ( @xmath18 in ( [ eq : dtls ] ) ) we have @xmath46 indicating the spin `` oscillates '' freely with frequency @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath47 two different effects occur in the frequency behavior of @xmath48 : ( 1 ) instead of a dirac delta function one finds a broadened peak and @xmath48 becomes finite at @xmath49 , indicating that the oscillations become damped ; ( 2 ) the maxima moves from @xmath3 to a renormalized value @xmath50 due to `` dressing '' of the spin by fast environmental modes . in the dtls ,",
    "the value of @xmath51 and its width @xmath52 are set by the @xmath53 : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , in the overdamped regime ( @xmath25 ) the peak in @xmath56 at finite frequency vanishes completely leaving a smooth function centered around @xmath49 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to study a model that can be considered a generalization of the dtls ( [ eq : dtls ] ) : @xmath57 where there are two independent dissipative baths labeled by operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 with couplings @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "notice that ( [ qfm ] ) reduces to the dtls , eq .  ( [ eq : dtls ] ) , when one of the couplings @xmath60 or @xmath61 vanishes . at first sight ,",
    "the only apparent difference between ( [ qfm ] ) and ( [ eq : dtls ] ) is the existence of an additional bosonic bath coupled to a third spin component .",
    "thus , naively one would expect an enhancement of decoherence in comparison with the dtls since more heat baths are present .",
    "this naive argument fails to grasp that both baths are `` competing '' with each other for the `` ordering '' of the impurity . while the coupling @xmath60 `` tries '' to localize the spin in an eigenstate of @xmath20 , the coupling @xmath61 also `` tries '' to localize the spin in an eigenstate of @xmath62 .",
    "however , we see from ( [ comrel ] ) that the operators @xmath20 and @xmath62 do not commute with each other and therefore one can not find a common eigenstate for the spin to localize in .",
    "this purely quantum mechanical effect leads to a _",
    "less decoherent _ environment .",
    "we will show that when @xmath63 and @xmath64 the spin dynamics is always in the underdamped regime , regardless of the bare value of the coupling constants . in our previous publication",
    "we called this state of affairs the `` quantum frustration of decoherence '' @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ qfm ] ) was originally obtained in the study of an spin @xmath65 impurity embedded in an environment of large spin - s in @xmath66 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the mapping between these two problems is given in appendix  [ sec : impurity - spin - in ] .",
    "the magnetic environment has two effects in the dynamics of the impurity .",
    "the molecular fields produced by the environmental spins favor the alignment of the impurity spin along the ordering direction giving rise to a `` magnetic field '' proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the transverse magnetic fluctuations ( spin waves ) produce quantum fluctuations that tend to misalign the impurity spin leading to couplings proportional to @xmath67 and therefore to dissipation . in an ordered antiferromagnetic spin environment the low energy , long - wavelength excitations ,",
    "are two massless goldstone modes ( two transverse magnon excitations ) that couple to the two different components of the spin as in ( [ qfm ] ) .",
    "the problem of impurities in magnetic media , especially in the paramagnetic phase , has received a lot of attention in the context of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "as we are going to show in what follows , the effect of quantum frustration occurs at finite energies or frequencies and therefore before the asymptotic regime is reached ( very low frequencies ) and the impurity spin fully aligns with the environmental spins .",
    "thus , as in the case of the kondo problem , quantum frustration is a crossover phenomenon that can not be obtained in `` asymptopia '' .",
    "we should stress , however , that the phenomenon of quantum frustration is more general than its origin would imply . as in the case of the kondo effect , it represents a universality class of impurity problems where decoherence is reduced by pure quantum mechanical effects .    as mentioned above , impurity problems can be treated by powerful theoretical techniques when reduced to one - dimensional models with a boundary .",
    "it is convenient , therefore , to rewrite ( [ qfm ] ) in a real space representation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are one dimensional chiral bosonic fields ( that is , left movers only ) associated with the bosonic modes @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and we have defined @xmath70 .",
    "we are ultimately interested in the general problem of decoherence described by ( [ qfm ] ) or ( [ eq : hamil-0 ] ) and the mechanism of quantum frustration associated with this model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we derive the main rg equations in section  [ sec : perturbative - renormalization - group ] and show that the dissipative model discussed here is always coherent and shows scaling at strong coupling ; in section  [ sec : susceptibility - at-@xmath71 we study the impurity susceptibility using numerical renormalization group and analytical rg via the callan - symansky equations ; section  [ conclusions ] contains a discussion of the problem of frustration of decoherence and also our conclusions .",
    "there are various appendices where the details of the calculations have been included .",
    "notice that , according to the rg equations ( [ kt ] ) , the kt transition occurs at a finite value of the coupling constant @xmath30 and therefore can not be obtained directly from perturbation theory .",
    "instead , one has to use a rotated basis of states , obtained from a unitary trasnformation , where the problem becomes perturbative .",
    "this can be accomplished in our case by defining two unitary transformations :    [ rotation ] @xmath72    that rotate the impurity spin around the @xmath73 direction by angles that depend on the field configurations and around @xmath62 ( @xmath20 ) by @xmath74 .",
    "notice that @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) generates a non - perturbative rotation in terms of the coupling @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "let us consider the problem after rotation by @xmath75 . by applying @xmath79 to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamil-0 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the free bosonic hamiltonian ( the first term in the left hand side of ( [ eq : hamil-0 ] ) ) .",

    "we can define the fourier transforms of the vertex operators , @xmath93 and bosonic fields @xmath94 , and divide the fields into slow modes , say @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and fast modes , say @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "we then integrate the fast modes within a shell @xmath99 , to obtain the renormalization of the slow fields due to the fast modes . in this procedure",
    "the renormalization of the slow modes is given by averages over the fast modes .",
    "it is straightforward to show that :    [ rgvertex ] @xmath100    where , @xmath101 and @xmath102 indicates the average of the operator @xmath103 over the fast modes . substituting ( [ rgvertex ] ) into ( [ eq : actionkappa1 ] ) and rescaling the fields in order to obtain the same partition function with slow modes",
    "only , we find that the couplings have to change with @xmath104 according to ( see appendix [ rgeq ] ) :    [ eq : rg-1 ] @xmath105    which define the rg equations for @xmath78 and @xmath106 but not for @xmath77 . the rg equation for @xmath77 is obtained in second order in @xmath106 . in the language defined by anderson - yuval - hamann @xcite",
    ", it corresponds to the renormalization in @xmath107 due to a `` close pair '' of flip and anti - flip that is removed from a spin history in a particular rg step .",
    "one can show that a new operator , which is not present in the original problem is generated under this procedure@xcite .",

    "@xmath126 is the crossover energy scale from weak to strong coupling ( the equivalent of the kondo temperature ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the value of @xmath126 depends on the bare value of @xmath127 . if @xmath128 the flow is essentially the same as the usual kt flow and one can disregard the flow of @xmath129 in order to find , @xmath130 }   \\label{taweak } \\end{aligned}\\ ]",

    "we immediately notice that the @xmath134 term in the rg destroys the kt transition . unlike the kondo problem the system retains coherence even at large coupling and is never overdamped .",
    "this is a quantum mechanical effect and comes from the fact that the spin operators do not commute . while the @xmath20 operator in ( [ qfm ] ) wants to orient the impurity spin in its direction , the same happens for the @xmath62 operator . in a classical system ( large @xmath141 ) the spin would orient in a finite angle in the xy plane .",
    "however for a finite @xmath141 impurity this is not possible and the impurity coupling is effectively _ quantum frustrated _ reducing the effective coupling to the environment .",
    "another interesting feature of the rg flow is that for @xmath142 we find , @xmath143 when @xmath144 , @xmath135 is essentially independent of @xmath145 at energy scale @xmath126 .",
    "while @xmath126 gives the crossover energy scale between weak and strong coupling , @xmath146 provides information about the dissipation rate , @xmath147 , of the impurity dynamics .",

    "[ isoflow ] we depict the rg flow in the @xmath30 versus @xmath106 plane . as discussed above , we can see that asymptotically ( that is , large @xmath104 ) @xmath129 renormalizes to zero while @xmath149 becomes large .",
    "an interesting feature of this rg , as we pointed out above , is that for large values of @xmath145 ( large coupling to the environment ) and intermediate values of @xmath104 the renormalization of @xmath149 becomes independent of @xmath145 .",
    "this indicates that there is a single variable that determines the rg flow at intermediate energy scales .",
    "the fact that only one coupling determines the rg flow indicates that there must be _ scaling _ in the physical properties with the renormalized value of @xmath106 . in the next section",
    "we will discuss how the rg results reflect on the behavior of the transverse susceptibility .",
    "in the previous section we discusse the rg calculation in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the rg indicates that for large values of the couplings nothing new should happen .",
    "nevertheless , given the perturbative nature of our analysis , this conclusion may not be warranted .",
    "our conclusions can be put on firmer ground with the use of numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite . in nrg",
    "we do not look at the renormalization of the couplings , as we did in the previous section , but at the behavior of the susceptibility itself .",
    "thus , in the first part of this section we study the behavior of the susceptibility as a function of the frequency at @xmath150 with nrg . in the second part of this section , based on the perturbative rg of the previous section and the nrg",
    ", we obtain analytic expressions for the transverse susceptibility in various regimes .",
    "we show that these two methods provide full support for the rg equations obtained in the previous section .      in order to learn more about the model",
    "we have performed numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations @xcite on the hamiltonian ( [ qfm ] ) .",
    "although nrg has recently been extended to bosonic models @xcite , we follow a more traditional approach and transform ( [ qfm ] ) into a fermionic problem .",
    "however , the bosonic baths @xmath151 and @xmath152 being ohmic , we can also represent them as the spin density fluctuations of two fermion fields , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the fermi velocity and @xmath157 are the local fermion operators .",
    "notice that we have two different set of fermions ( labeled by @xmath158 ) that couple by x and y - component of their `` spin '' to the corresponding components of the impurity spin .    in order for ( [ eq : fermionicsb ] ) to be a faithful representation of ( [ qfm ] ) one has to map the bosonic couplings @xmath159 into the fermionic couplings @xmath160 .",
    "as in the case of the kondo problem @xcite the bosonic couplings are related to the electronic couplings through the electronic phase shifts @xmath161 and @xmath162 : @xmath163 here the phase shifts can be determined directly from the nrg spectrum .",
    "the price what one has to pay for this simplicity is that the entire parameter space of the fermionic model @xmath164 covers only a smaller regime of the original model @xmath165 and therefore the localization transition is beyond the boundaries of the method .",
    "the phase shifts are given with a very good accuracy by : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the parameter of the logarithmic discretization used in nrg and @xmath168 is a numerically determinable factor close to unity .",
    "for the numerical work we used @xmath169 and we find @xmath170 ( see fig .  [",

    "notice that , in agreement with the rg calculation , the susceptibility retains a peak even for strong coupling indicating that the spin remains coherent .",
    "furthermore , as the coupling increases the susceptibility curves collapse into a universal curve showing that at large couplings to the environment the susceptibility can be written in a scaling form : @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 is a universal function so that @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "these results are in agreement with our earlier conclusions based on the rg calculation .    to compare results for our model with that of the single bath dtls , we have calculated @xmath180 for @xmath181 and @xmath182 and compared with the case where @xmath183 . the result is shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "notice that in the dtls case there is no trace of the peak in the susceptibility indicating that the relaxation of the spin is completely overdamped .",
    "however , in the isotropic case one finds a well defined peak even when the coupling to the environment is large , indicating that the spin still keeps memory of the tunneling splitting , even when strongly interacting with the bath .",
    "this is a clear demonstration of the effect of frustration of decoherence .",
    "the rg results of section [ sec : perturbative - renormalization - group ] show that the transverse couplings of the impurity to the environment always flow to @xmath184 indicating that a perturbative approach should give a sensible result .",

    "an important concept in the study of decoherence is the notion of a _ preferred basis _ : every time that a system interacts with an environment , a set of states is naturally selected by the form of the interaction .",

    "the entanglement of @xmath17 with each one of the baths is suppressed by the other , and as a result the decoherence phenomena is frustrated .",
    "this physical picture shows the true meaning of our results , the `` quantum frustration '' is the lack of a _ preferred basis _ for the system of interest .",

    "so it is a rather remarkable fact that even the @xmath281 symmetry which remains when @xmath282 can be spontaneously broken , as in the case of the dtls .",
    "the @xmath278 symmetry would have to be spontaneously broken in a phase in which the spin is localized in an eigenstate of either @xmath20 or @xmath62 .",

    "this can be achieved when the role of the two baths is played by two goldstone modes , resulting from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry , such that the residual unbroken symmetry rotates the two goldstone modes into each other .",
    "when the couplings are not exactly equal quantum frustration occurs up to a certain energy scale below which one of the heat baths takes over and one obtains the standard decoherence problem in dissipative ohmic systems . in terms of fig.[cap : rgflow-1 ] it means that the asymptotic flow is the one for either @xmath116 or @xmath282 . in summary , quantum frustration of decoherence is a general phenomena .",
    "it has clear implications to quantum / classical transition and measure theory .",
    "moreover it is potentially important to the development of technologies where decoherence is a fundamental issue as in the case of quantum communication and quantum computation .    in summary , we have studied a model of quantum frustration of decoherence in open systems .",
    "contrary to standard dissipative models with ohmic dissipation , the non - commutative nature of spin operators lead to a frustration of decoherence .",
    "we have shown that while in a dtls the spin dynamics becomes overdamped at large couplings with a heat bath , in a system with quantum frustration it is always underdamped and the system keeps the memory of its quantum nature .",
    "using perturbative rg calculations we have shown that at large couplings with the bath the transverse spin susceptibility shows scaling with a characteristic energy scale @xmath126 , the analogous of the kondo temperature in the dtls , that separates the region of strong to weak coupling .",
