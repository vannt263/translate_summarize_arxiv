    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    spin - orbit ( so ) splitting @xmath0 at the top of the valence band of a semiconductor is an important parameter for the determination of optical transitions in these systems.@xcite it is also an important parameter to gauge the chemical environment and bonding of a semiconductor.@xcite extensive studies of so splitting , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite have been carried out in the past .",
    "however , most of these studies focussed on a specific compound or a small group of similar compounds .",
    "therefore , the general trends of the spin - orbit splitting in zinc - blende semiconductors is not very well established . from the experimental point of view , some of the data were measured more than 30 years ago,@xcite and the accuracy of these data is still under debate .",
    "for example , previous experimental data suggest that cdte and hgte have so splittings @xmath4 at about 0.8 and 1.08 ev , respectively.@xcite these values have been used widely by experimental groups@xcite to interpret optical and magneto - optical transition data of cdte , hgte , and related alloys and heterostructures .",
    "however , recent experimental data suggest that @xmath4 for cdte and hgte are instead around 0.95 ev@xcite and 0.91 ev.@xcite without basic understanding of the general trends of variation of @xmath4 in tetrahedral semiconductors , it is difficult to judge what should be the correct value of @xmath4 for cdte and hgte .",
    "there are also several non - conventional ii - vi and iii - v semiconductors that do not have a zinc - blende ground state ( e.g. , cdo , mgo , gabi , inbi ) , but that do form zinc - blende alloys with other compounds , and are currently under intensive research as novel optoelectronic materials.@xcite therefore , it is important to know the spin - orbit splittings of these compounds in the zinc - blende phase and understand how they vary as a function of alloy concentration @xmath8 in the alloy .     local orbitals .",
    "the graph corresponds to the data in column `` lapw+@xmath1 '' of tables [ sodata435 ] , [ sodata26 ] , and [ sodata17 ] .",
    ", width=283 ]    from the theoretical point of view , various approximations have been used to calculate and/or predict so splitting @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is not clear how these approximations affect the calculated @xmath4 .",
    "for example , one of the most widely used procedures for calculating the so coupling using the density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) and local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) is the second - variation method@xcite used in many all - electron linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) codes.@xcite in this approach , following the suggestion of koelling and harmon,@xcite the hamiltonian of the relativistic dirac equation is separated into a `` j - weighted - averaged '' scalar relativistic hamiltonian @xmath9 , in which the dependancy on the quantum number @xmath10 [ where @xmath11 , with @xmath12 with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the relativistically enhanced electron mass , @xmath15 is the speed of light , v is the effective potential , @xmath16 is the eigenvalue , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pauli spin and angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "the scalar relativistic hamiltonian , which includes the mass velocity and darwin corrections , is solved first using standard diagonalization method for each spin orientation ( or solved just once if the system is not spin polarized ) . the so hamiltonian is included subsequently , in where the full hamiltonian is solved using the scalar relativistic wavefunctions as basis set .",
    "normally , only a small number of scalar relativistic wavefunctions are included in the second step , and only the spherical part of the potential within a muffin - tin sphere centered on each atomic site is used in the so hamiltonian .",
    "the advantage of the second - variation method is the physical transparency ( e.g. , it keeps spin as a good quantum number as long as possible ) and the efficiency , because , in most cases in the second step , only a small number of basis functions are needed to have good agreement with solutions of fully relativistic dirac equations .",
    "this approach has been shown to obtain @xmath4 that is in excellent agreement with experiments .",
    "for example , the calculated @xmath4 for gaas is 0.34 ev compared with experimental data of 0.34 ev.@xcite however , one major approximation in the `` j - weighted - averaged '' treatment is the replacement of the two @xmath1 and @xmath6 orbitals by one @xmath7 orbital .",
    "although this is a good approximation for atoms with low atomic number , it has been show that such approximation fails for heavy atoms.@xcite the main reason for this failure is because the @xmath1 orbital has finite magnitude at the nuclear site , whereas the @xmath19 orbital has zero magnitude at the nuclear site .",
    "figure  [ asbi ] plots the @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 orbitals for as ( z=33 ) and bi ( z=83 ) . as we can see , the @xmath1 orbital deviates significantly from the @xmath7 orbital near the origin .",
    "the error clearly increases as the atomic number increases , and is very large for heavier elements such as bi .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 orbital is not very well represented near the nuclear site using the @xmath7 orbital , even with the addition of its energy derivative in the linearization procedure.@xcite consequently , the so splitting can not be accurately evaluated , in general , with solely the @xmath7 orbital .",
    "however , no systematic studies have been done to evaluate the effect of the @xmath1 orbital on the calculated so splitting @xmath4 .     for atoms studied in this paper .",
    "the spin - orbit splittings increase as a function of the atomic number z. see table [ p12p32 ] for data subdivided according to their respective groups .",

    "we find that the calculated so splittings including the @xmath1 local orbital are in good agreement with available experimental data .",

    "it is interesting to note that the differences of @xmath4 between the ii - vi , the iii - v , and the group iv compounds in the same row increases as @xmath49 increases ( almost doubles when @xmath49 increases by one ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the atomic number @xmath43 almost doubles when @xmath49 is increased by one , whereas the atomic so splitting is proportional to @xmath54 with @xmath27 close to 2 ( see table [ p12p32 ] and the discussion above ) ; thus , the difference is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "\\(v ) the a@xmath55x@xmath56 halides ( a@xmath55 = cu , ag , au ; x@xmath56 = cl , br , i ) constitute a group of special compounds that do not follow the rules discussed above .",
    "for example , when moving from znse to cubr with increased ionicity ( see figure  [ gegaasznse ] ) , the so splitting of cubr ( 82 mev ) is much smaller than that for znse ( 398 mev ) .",
    "the so splitting of agi ( 664 mev ) is also much smaller than that of cdte ( 880 mev ) .",
    "furthermore , many of the ib - vii compounds ( cucl , agcl , aucl , and cubr ) have negative so splittings , and for these ionic compounds cux@xmath56 has much smaller so splittings than agx@xmath56 and aux@xmath56 .",
    "the origin of these anomalies is due to the fact that for most of the ib - vii compounds the vbm is no longer an anion @xmath3 dominated state .",
    "instead , they are cation @xmath5 states strongly hybridized with the anion @xmath3 state . for instance , in figure  [ gegaasznse](d ) we show that the vbm of cubr has a very pronounced antibonding @xmath5 character at the cation cu site . because the @xmath5 state has negative @xmath4",
    ", this explains why some of the ib - vii compounds have negative @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , because cu 3@xmath5 level is much higher than ag 4@xmath5 and au 5@xmath5 levels , the vbm of cu halides contains more cation @xmath5 character than ag and au compounds .",
    "this explains why cu halides have much smaller @xmath4 than the ag and au common anion halides .",
    "our calculated results with the @xmath1 local orbitals are compared with experimental data.@xcite for most semiconductors the agreement is very good .",
    "for example , the calculated value for diamond ( 13 mev ) is in very good agreement with the recent experimentally derived value of 13 mev.@xcite the experimental value for sic in the zinc - blende structure ( 10 mev)@xcite is smaller than the one for c , therefore , does not follow the chemical trend .",
    "we suggest that the measured value is possibly underestimated . for most semiconductors ,",
    "the difference between theory and experiment is usually less than 20 mev .",
    "however , there are several noticeable cases in which the difference is much larger .",
    "for example , for @xmath27-sn , the calculated value is 697 mev , whereas the value in experiment data@xcite is @xmath2800 mev . for hgte",
    "the calculated value at 800 mev is much smaller than the widely used experimental value@xcite of 1080 mev . to understand the origin of the discrepancy , we performed the following tests .",
    "first , we considered a different numerical approach , i.e. , the frozen core paw method as implemented in the vasp code to calculate the so splitting @xmath4 . despite the large difference in the way the so coupling is implemented in the calculations , we find that the @xmath4 calculated with the paw method are very similar to that obtained with the flapw method . for @xmath27-sn and hgte ,",
    "the results obtained by the paw method are 689 and 781 mev , respectively , in good agreement with the flapw - calculated values of 697 and 800 mev .",
    "next , we estimated the effect of @xmath3@xmath5 coupling .",
    "it has been argued that the lda - calculated cation @xmath5 orbitals are too shallow,@xcite so @xmath3@xmath5 hybridization at the vbm is overestimated , which may lead to smaller calculated @xmath4 . to verify",
    "if this is the possible reason , we performed the following calculations .",
    "( i ) after obtaining the converged lda potential , we removed the cation @xmath5 orbital from the basis set to calculate the @xmath4 .",
    "we find that for @xmath27-sn , this procedure has no effect on the calculated @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that for this compound , the cation @xmath5 and anion @xmath3 separation is large enough that the amount of cation @xmath5 orbital at the vbm is not sufficient to affect the calculated @xmath4 . for znte , cdte , and hgte , removing the cation @xmath5 orbital increases the @xmath4 by 48 , 63 , and 253 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are the upper limit on the possible effect of @xmath3@xmath5 coupling on the calculated @xmath4 .",
    "( ii ) to get more reliable estimates on the lda error of the calculated @xmath4 , we added an external potential@xcite on the cation muffin - tin sphere to push down the cation @xmath5 orbitals such that the calculated cation binding energy is close to the experimental photemission data.@xcite in this case , the calculated @xmath4 is 0.94 , 0.91 , and 0.90 ev for znte , cdte , and hgte , respectively .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that the possible lda error in calculating @xmath4 is less than 30 , 40 , and 110 mev for zn , cd , and hg compounds , respectively , and much smaller for other compounds .",
    "our analysis above suggests that @xmath4 for @xmath27-sn and hgte should be around 0.70 and 0.90 ev , respectively , smaller than the experimental values of 0.80 and 1.08 ev , respectively .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is still not very clear .",
    "but we notice that @xmath27-sn and hgte are semimetals , i.e. , the @xmath57 state is below the vbm .",
    "this makes the accurate measurement of the @xmath4 for these compounds more challenging .",
    "indeed , recent measurements@xcite of @xmath4 for hgte show that it has a value of 0.9 ev , in good agreement with our predicted value .",
    "we also notice that the recent reported experimental so splitting for insb,@xcite which has a very small band gap ( 0.24 ev ) , agrees well with our calculation .",
    "further experimental studies are needed to clarify these issues .",
    "in summary , we have studied systematically the so splitting @xmath4 of all diamond - like group iv and zinc - blende group iii - v , ii - vi , and i - vii semiconductors using the first - principles band structure method .",
    "we studied the effect of the @xmath1 local orbitals on the calculated @xmath4 .",
    "the general trends of @xmath4 of the semiconductors are revealed and explained in terms of atomic so splitting , volume deformation - induced charge renormalization , and cation - anion @xmath3@xmath5 couplings . in most cases ,",
    "our calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the differences between our calculated value for @xmath27-sn and hgte , and to a lesser degree for inas and gasb , are highlighted .",
    "experiments are called for to test our predictions .",
