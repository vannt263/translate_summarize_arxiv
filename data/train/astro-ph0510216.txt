    "a variety of astronomical observations indicate that interstellar dust is a pervasive galactic component , not only in the milky way and nearby galaxies , but also in the high - redshift universe ( meurer 2004 ) . among quasar absorbers ,",
    "damped lyman @xmath3 ( dla ) systems are the best candidates to host dust because of their high hi column density , which shields the grain from ionizing photons , and of their metal content , higher than in other absorbers .",
    "if dust is present in dla systems , it will scatter and absorb the radiation of the background quasar , dimming its apparent magnitude ( extinction ) and changing the slope of its energy distribution ( reddening ) . in the most extreme cases , the extinction may obscure the quasar leading to a selection effect , the obscuration bias , which may prevent the detection of metal - rich , dusty dlas ( ostriker & heisler 1984 , fall & pei 1993 ) .    measuring",
    "the extinction or reddening of dlas is a difficult task owing to the uncertain , variable continuum of the quasars .",
    "detection of quasar reddening from intervening dlas was first claimed by pei et al .",
    "recent investigations based on large data sets find reddening from metal absorbers at redshift @xmath7 ( khare et al .",
    "2005 ) , but not from dlas at @xmath8 ( murphy & liske 2004 ) .",
    "differential reddening in two lines of sight of one dla at @xmath9 has been reported from the study of a gravitationally lensed quasar ( lopez 2005 ) .",
    "evidence of the obscuration bias has been searched by comparing the statistics of magnitude - limited surveys with those of complete surveys of dlas lying in front of radio - selected quasars .",
    "the corals survey has provided a marginal signal of obscuration in the absorber number density , the neutral gas content ( ellison et al . 2001 ) and the metallicity ( ellison 2005 ) , but only at @xmath10 level in each case .",
    "the lack of dla systems with high values of metallicity and hi column density , above the threshold @xmath11 [ @xmath12 @xmath13 , was tentatively attributed to the effect of dust obscuration ( boiss et al .",
    "the original motivation of the present work was to understand if that threshold can be quantitatively explained in terms of a fast rise of the dla extinction , in which case it would represent an important clue of the obscuration effect . with this goal in mind , we first derived the relation between interstellar extinction and @xmath14 .",
    "we then used this relation to quantify the effect of the bias on the distributions of column densities and metallicities of dlas .",
    "finally , we applied our method to the current sample dlas with znii measurements .",
    "these three parts of our work are briefly outlined in the next three sections .",
    "more details can be found in the full paper ( vladilo & proux 2005 ) .",
    "the extinction in a photometric band with effective wavelength @xmath15 , @xmath16 , is related to the line - of - sight zinc column density , @xmath17 , by means of the relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 these relations can be derived by comparing the column densities of a refractory and a volatile element in a given line of sight ( we adopted iron and zinc , respectively ) .",
    "the expression ( [ a_lambda ] ) is composed of : ( 1 ) constant factors ( e.g. a@xmath20 is the atomic mass of iron ) ; ( 2 ) a dust grains parameter , @xmath21 ; ( 3 ) the fraction of iron and zinc atoms which are incorporated in the dust , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; ( 4 ) the relative abundance of iron and zinc in the medium , ( fe / zn ) .",
    "this last term is expected to be constant , close to the solar value , in the local ism .",
    "the term @xmath24 is approximately constant and @xmath25 by definition of refractory and volatile elements .",
    "the only factor expected to vary is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a geometrical factor ( @xmath28 for spherical grains ) , @xmath29 the extinction efficiency factor ( spitzer 1978 ) , @xmath30 the grain radius , @xmath31 the grain density , and @xmath32 the abundance by mass of iron in the dust .",
    "we tested and calibrated the relation ( [ a_zn ] ) using interstellar measurements of extinction and @xmath33(znii ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ av_nzn ] .",
    "the data follow the expected trend and yield a mean value of the @xmath34 parameter in v band @xmath35 magnitudes @xmath36 . from the condition @xmath37 magnitude",
    ", we obtain a turning point @xmath38(znii ) @xmath39 , above which the extinction experiences a dramatic rise .",
    "this extinction barrier lies remarkably close to the boiss threshold and this fact motivated us to study the extinction relation for dlas . as a result",
    ", we obtained that the observer s frame extinction of a dla at redshift @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 mag @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a normalized extinction curve ; @xmath46 zn / h and @xmath47 are the metallicity and hi column density of the absorber ; @xmath48 is an analytical function , based on depletion data ( vladilo 2004 ) , that gives the fraction of iron in dust as a function of the metallicity . since @xmath48 vanishes at low metallicities ( fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) , the predicted extinction will accordingly vanish .",
    "thanks to this fact , we do not need to know the value of the grain parameter at the very early stages of chemical evolution , when the behaviour of the dust is most unpredictable .",
    "in the application of eq .",
    "( [ alamhzeta ] ) we consider both a ` milky - way ' and a small magellanic cloud ( ` smc ' ) type of dust . for each type",
    "we adopt an appropriate @xmath49 and @xmath50 , making also use of smc extinction data ( see details in the full paper ) .    0.7 cm   0.7 cm",
    "at a given redshift , the distribution of dla extinctions and the obscuration bias are completely determined from ( [ alamhzeta ] ) for any assigned pair of @xmath33(hi ) and @xmath4 distributions .",
    "we used this property to find the relation between true and biased distributions of @xmath33(hi ) and @xmath4 in dlas .",
    "simple mathematical expressions can be derived by assuming that the distributions of @xmath33(hi ) and @xmath4 are statistically independent and by ignoring multiple dla absorptions in a given line of sight .",
    "both assumptions are conservative in the sense that they may slightly underestimate the effect of quasar obscuration .",
    "the fraction of dla - quasar pairs that can be detected in the differential element @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the extinction ( [ alamhzeta ] ) , @xmath54 is the distribution of the quasar apparent magnitudes @xmath55 , and @xmath56 the limiting magnitude of the survey . in the redshift interval @xmath57 the relations between the true distributions of @xmath33(hi ) and @xmath4 in dlas , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the corresponding biased distributios , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 atoms @xmath36 .",
    "the goal of our procedure is to invert these equations in order to recover the true distributions given the biased ones , which can be estimated from magnitude - limited surveys .",
    "to do so we use the procedure sketched in fig .",
    "2 . we model the unknown distributions @xmath58 and @xmath59 using analytical functions with free parameters .",
    "we start from a set of trial parameters and compute the extinction distribution , the function @xmath66 and the biased distributions .",
    "we then compute the @xmath67 deviation between the biased distributions and the observed ones .",
    "the procedure is iterated to find a minimum in the @xmath67 values . at each iteration",
    "we estimate the true distribution of quasar apparent magnitudes , @xmath54 , by correcting the observed magnitude distribution taking into account the effect of the extinction . in this way",
    "we do not need to assume a quasar luminosity function .",
    "for this and other reasons our procedure is different from the one presented by fall & pei ( 1993 ) .",
    "1.5 cm -1.2 cm",
    "as a first application of our method we considered the sample of dlas with znii data .",
    "the distribution of apparent magnitudes was measured from the quasar counts in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 bands of the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the extinctions were estimated in the same two bands .",
    "the selected sample is characterized by a quasar limiting magnitude @xmath70 in the optical , required to detect the znii lines at high spectra resolution .",
    "most data are concentrated in the range @xmath71 , with a median redshift @xmath72 .",
    "the current limitation of the statistics ( about 40 dlas in 2004 ) allowed us to compute the empirical distributions in a small number of bins . because of the limited empirical contraints we modeled the true distributions @xmath58 and @xmath59 using functions with the smallest possible number of parameters .",
    "for the @xmath33(hi ) distribution we adopted a power law @xmath73 truncated at the highest observed values of dla column density , @xmath38(hi ) @xmath74 .",
    "for the metallicity distribution we adopted a schechter function @xmath75 . with tighter observational constraints available in the future , it will be possible to model the true distributions more realistically .",
    "for the different types of dust ( mw- and smc - type ) and photometric bands considered , we found that the slope of the @xmath33(hi ) power law lies in the range @xmath76 , with typical fit errors of @xmath77 .",
    "the mean value @xmath78 of the schechter metallicity distribution lies in the range @xmath79 , with fit errors of @xmath80 dex and total errors ( including the uncertainty of the empirical distributions ) of @xmath81 dex .",

    "3 ( right panel ) . the distribution has a median value of 0.14 mag in the @xmath68 band , but is extremely asymmetric .",
    "most dlas have negligible or little extinction , but the long tail of the distribution , extending up to very high values , indicates that a significant fraction of dlas may indeed obscure the background quasar .",
    "we estimate that the missed fraction is @xmath85 30% to 50% at limiting magnitude @xmath86 , but decreases steadily with @xmath56 .",
    "surveys @xmath87 are weakly affected by the bias .",
    "the extinction distribution highlights the difficulty of measuring the ` mean ' dla reddening using large data sets of quasars .",
    "the predicted median reddening is relatively low ( @xmath88 magnitudes ) and hard to detect on the uncertain quasar continuum .",
    "in addition , the procedure of stacking a large number of spectra for detecting the ` mean ' reddening can give a meaningful answer only if the mean change of continuum slope is a fair representation of the change of slope of individual cases .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the iron dust fraction ( fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) indicates that dla extinction should become negligible at [ zn / h ] @xmath89 . in conjunction with the trend of decreasing [ zn / h ] with redshift ( vladilo et al .",
    "2000 ) , this in turn suggests that dla extinction may vanish at @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the difficulty of detecting quasar reddening from dlas at @xmath91 ( murphy & liske 2004 ) may be due , in part , to the intrinsic decline of the dust content at high redshift .    an interesting prediction of our method is the fraction of obscured dlas as a function of @xmath33(znii ) , @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "[ phi ] ( left panel ) one can see that @xmath92 shows a sharp rise exactly around the boiss s threshold @xmath93 .",
    "this remarkable result , obtained without tuning the dust parameters , demonstrates that the obscuration effect provides a natural explanation for the threshold . to discard this explanation",
    "one should invoke some unknown mechanism for explaning the lack of dlas with @xmath94 and , in addition , one should tune the dust parameters in such a way to move the threshold at much higher values of @xmath11 .",
    "our explanation is certainly more attractive in terms of economy of hypothesis .",
    "the reality of boiss s threshold has been invoked to bring into agreement predictions of galactic chemical evolution models ( prantzos & boissier 2000 ) and of cosmological simulations",
    "( cen et al . 2003 ) with seemingly discrepant observations of dlas .",
    "the existence of a physical explanation for the threshold favours a scenario in which the predictions of such models are generally correct and the obscuration bias plays an important role .",
    "the combination of the limit @xmath95 with the cutoff @xmath96 imposed in the surveys creates a cutoff of the highest possible metallicity detectable in dlas . the way the obscuration bias affects the metallicity distribution is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "one can see that the bias severely hampers the detection of dlas with near solar metallicity . because of the implications on our understanding of the star formation history of the universe , the effect on the metallicity distribution is probably the most important consequence of the obscuration bias .",
