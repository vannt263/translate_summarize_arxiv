    "the lmc and smc are the most massive satellites of the milky way .",

    "the lmc rotation curve inferred from the tgas data is more useful than that derived from the _ hst _ pm data , because it pertains to a single stellar population instead of a mixed population .",

    "this is due in part to the random errors on the pm rotation curve , and in part to the random errors on the inclination of the disk .",
    "but this method for determining the lmc distance will become more competitive with future _ gaia _ data releases .",

    "<S> tycho_-_gaia _ astrometric solution ( tgas ) pms for 29 _ hipparcos _ stars in the lmc and 8 in the smc . </S>",
    "<S> the lmc pm in the west and north directions is inferred to be @xmath0 , and the smc pm @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these results have similar accuracy and agree to within the uncertainties with existing hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) pm measurements . </S>",
    "<S> since tgas uses different methods with different systematics , this provides an external validation of both data sets and their underlying approaches . </S>",
    "<S> residual dr1 systematics may affect the tgas results , but the _ hst _ agreement implies this must be below the random errors . also in agreement with prior _ hst _ studies </S>",
    "<S> , the tgas lmc pm field clearly shows the clockwise rotation of the disk , even though it takes the lmc disk in excess of @xmath2 years to complete one revolution . </S>",
    "<S> the implied rotation curve amplitude for young lmc stars is consistent with that inferred from line - of - sight ( los ) velocity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the pm and los rotation curves implies a kinematic lmc distance modulus @xmath3 , consistent but not yet competitive with photometric methods . </S>",
    "<S> these first results from _ gaia _ on the topic of local group dynamics provide an indication of how its future data releases will revolutionize this field . </S>"
