    "stellar streams are found throughout the galactic halos of the milky way , andromeda ( hereafter m31 ) and other nearby massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these streams are presumed to originate from disrupting dwarf galaxies or globular clusters , providing evidence that galaxies are formed , at least in part , hierarchically .",
    "the recent discovery of numerous milky way stellar streams is due to wide - field photometric surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "many of these streams are associated with known objects such as the tidal tail system of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) or with globular clusters ( e.g. , palomar  5 ; @xcite , palomar  14 ; @xcite ) . some streams , however , are identified as isolated features in which the progenitor object is not yet identified or has been tidally disrupted beyond recognition ( e.g. , monoceros stream , @xcite ; orphan stream , @xcite ) .",
    "stellar streams can extend over large physical distances and are sensitive to the strength and shape of the galactic gravitational potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as to its lumpiness @xcite .",
    "the gd-1 tidal stream @xcite is sufficiently nearby ( 10kpc ) that proper motions are available for its member stars .",
    "@xcite analyzed the full , six  dimensional phase space for gd-1 , placing a strong constraint on the flattening of the milky way potential between 10 - 15kpc which is dominated by the galactic disk .",
    "an analysis of more distant streams will provide similar constraints on the galactic halo potential .",
    "each individual stream provides independent constraints on the galactic potential , thus a joint analysis of many streams provides a promising method to constrain the full milky way potential .",
    "here we present evidence for a new milky way stellar stream , which we name the triangulum stream , found in projection against m31 and m33 . in ",
    "[ sec : dataanalysis ] we discuss the sdss data analysis and matched - filter technique . in  [ sec : results ] , we determine the stream properties , and discuss its relationship to other galactic substructures in  [ ssec : other ] .",
    "we search for stellar streams in the sloan digital sky survey data release 8 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss dr8 ) .",
    "we select stars brighter than @xmath7 over the 14,555 deg@xmath8 sdss coverage , of which 5200 deg@xmath8 is newly released imaging in the southern galactic hemisphere . at these magnitudes ,",
    "the majority of stars belong to the milky way disk .",
    "stars in substructures typically belong to different stellar populations as compared to the milky way disk and can be distinguished by their chemical composition and age .",
    "@xcite first introduced the matched - filter technique in the context of milky way substructure searches .",
    "matched filtering works by preferentially weighting stars , in color - magnitude space , with a higher probability of being part of a stream population .",
    "filters used in this work are based on the globular cluster m13 , whose old age and low metallicity ( @xmath9gyr and [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.6 $ ] ; @xcite ) are similar to other known cold stellar streams . m13 is observed by sdss , thus no filter transformations are required .",
    "our filter is constructed by dividing a hess diagram of the target population ( figure  [ filter]a ) by a hess diagram of the foreground ( figure  [ filter]b ) .",
    "the filter target stars are selected from the dr8 photometric catalog within a radius of @xmath11 from m13 s center .",
    "the foreground population is selected locally , between @xmath12 and @xmath13 from m13 .",
    "the final filter is smoothed and confined to a region following the target population s isochrone within a generous tolerance ( figure  [ filter]c ) , which accommodates isochrones of other commonly used globular clusters ( e.g. , m92 ) .",
    "our approach ensures that regions in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) with high contrast between the target and foreground population are given the most weight in filtering .",
    "the filter is most heavily weighted near the main sequence turn - off ( figure  [ filter]c ) , where numerous m13 stars are present , but few galactic stars are as blue in color .",
    "the main sequence is less weighted because of the large population of milky way stars present redward of the turn - off .",
    "the subgiant and giant branches are weighted the least because of the small number of m13 stars which occupy those areas of the cmd .",
    "a total of four matched filters ( in @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 , @xmath16 vs.  @xmath15 , @xmath16 vs.  @xmath17 and @xmath16 vs.  @xmath18 ) were applied to the whole sdss survey area for a distance range between 8kpc and 40kpc .",
    "the inner distance limit was chosen to avoid the milky way disk , while the outer limit is the distance at which the main sequence turnoff falls below the sdss 95% completeness limit @xcite .",
    "each filter was applied to the full sdss photometric sample and the resulting density maps were coadded",
    ". the left column of figure  [ map ] shows the final density maps for the north galactic hemisphere , while right panels show the south galactic hemisphere .",
    "the sdss footprint in the north has been extensively searched for halo substructure and is known as the `` field of streams '' @xcite .",
    "we recover both compact and diffuse known objects in this field .",
    "globular clusters and dwarf galaxies are visible as small , concentrated overdensities . at a distance of 8 kpc ( figure  [ map ] , top )",
    "we detect the cold gd-1 stream , as well as the much wider signatures of the monoceros stream and leading sagittarius tidal arm . at a distance of 26 kpc ( figure  [ map ] , bottom ) we detect the tidal tails of the palomar 5 globular cluster and the orphan stream .",
    "a visual search of these maps does not reveal any new stellar streams beyond those which have been published .",
    "our method recovers streams down to the limit of the faint lethe and styx streams @xcite .",
    "stellar density maps of the south galactic hemisphere are shown in the right column of figure  [ map ] , at distances of 8 kpc ( top ) and 26 kpc ( bottom ) .",
    "the sagittarius trailing tidal arm is visible at both distances . at larger latitudes",
    "we also detect a fainter stream parallel to the stronger sagittarius tail , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a visual search of the southern maps reveals a new stream in the region of m31/m33 which we describe in detail below .",
    "no other substructure features were detected .",
    "we demonstrate in figure  [ map ] that our search method recovers all known stellar streams thus far published .",
    "in addition , we find evidence for a new narrow stream in the direction of the m31/m33 region which we name the triangulum stream . in  [ ssec : other ] , we discuss this new stream in the context of other known substructure in this region .",
    "the triangulum stream is long and very narrow ( figure  [ profile]a ) . to ensure that the feature is indeed a stellar overdensity , we show the dust extinction ( figure  [ profile]b ; * ? ? ? * ) and number counts of blue sdss galaxies ( figure  [ profile]c ) in the stream region .",
    "neither dust nor galaxies show an overdensity in the stream region .",
    "the triangulum stream is nearly linear on the sky , whose coordinates satisfy the equation : @xmath19 in the range ra@xmath20 ( table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "we define a new coordinate system such that the stream runs along a @xmath21-axis .",
    "this system is an equatorial system rotated @xmath22 counterclockwise around ra @xmath23 and dec @xmath24 .",
    "a stellar density map of the stream region in this new coordinate system is shown in figure  [ profile]d . to assess the statistical significance of this overdensity",
    ", we create a one  dimensional stellar density profile of the stream ( regions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , marked with red and blue lines on figure  [ profile]d , respectively ) extending @xmath27 on each side of the stream .",
    "for @xmath28 the stream profile is affected by the incomplete sdss coverage .",
    "we correct for completeness by dividing the profile value with the fraction of populated pixels in each vertical bin .",
    "this procedure enables easier analysis of the stream profile , but it also introduces additional noise to the profile at @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting profile is shown in figure  [ profile]e : blue and red lines are profiles of top and bottom stream regions , respectively , while the black line is their average .",
    "the stream signal was strongest for the matched filter at 26 kpc .",
    "we show this quantitatively by fitting a gaussian function with a constant term to the stream profile at a range of distances between 20kpc and 30kpc . a levenberg ",
    "marquardt minimization algorithm was used to solve for the mean , dispersion , and normalization of the distribution .",
    "both the dispersion and peak of the profile are maximized at a distance of @xmath29kpc , while the mean does not depend on the distance .",
    "the height of the stream peak is @xmath30 above the background noise ( estimated in the region @xmath31 ) at distances @xmath32kpc .",
    "we adopt a distance to the stream of @xmath4kpc .",
    "the measured angular extent is @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which correspond to a width of @xmath35pc and a length of @xmath36kpc in physical units .",
    "we also detected a @xmath37 overdensity of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars in the lower part of the stream region ( @xmath25 ) . in this box , the @xmath38 wide strip contains on average @xmath39 bhbs in the stream fields ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 bhbs in the off fields ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "in general , the shape of a stellar stream traces the past orbit of its progenitor .",
    "the stream width correlates with progenitor mass , while the length of a stream is related to the time since the stars became unbound @xcite .",
    "the average width of the triangulum stream , @xmath42 ( 75pc ) , is comparable to other globular cluster streams in the literature . the gd-1 stream ,",
    "whose progenitor is undetected but presumed to be a globular cluster , is @xmath43 ( 35 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the globular cluster pal 5 is @xmath44 ( 120pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , dwarf galaxies produce much broader streams : the orphan stream is @xmath45 wide ( 730pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the sagittarius stream is @xmath46 or more ( 7kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the triangulum stream suggests that its progenitor is a globular cluster , consistent with the age and metallicity determined below .",
    "our estimated length for the triangulum stream , @xmath47 ( 5.5kpc ) , is likely an underestimate given the incompleteness of the sdss data .",
    "this is shorter , but comparable to the palomar 5 stream ( @xmath48 , 9kpc ) .",
    "deeper imaging along the triangulum stream may reveal a longer extent than detected in the sdss data .",
    "we estimate the age and metallicity of the triangulum stream using the best - fitting distance of @xmath4kpc . due to the small number of stars associated with the stream , the cmd in this region is dominated by milky way foreground stars . we therefore follow @xcite in constructing a statistically subtracted cmd .",
    "first , we create a 1d profile of all stars satisfying the color - magnitude cut @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the stream region ( @xmath51 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "this produces a well populated profile , with predominantly stream stars .",
    "next , we fit a gaussian to this profile to determine the central position @xmath52 and width @xmath53 . to construct a statistically - subtracted hess diagram",
    ", we create a 1d profile for stars in every pixel in the hess diagram , fit the profile with a gaussian of central position @xmath52 and width @xmath53 , and assign each pixel the fitted gaussian normalization . thus , higher - value pixels correspond to regions with higher density profile in the stream region and , consequently , higher probability of being occupied by a stream rather than a foreground star .",
    "the statistically subtracted @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 hess diagram is noisy , but clearly shows an overdensity at @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( figure  [ cmd]a ) . at a distance of 26",
    "kpc , this overdensity corresponds to main sequence stars , and a hint of a main sequence turnoff is indeed seen .",
    "the contour of a smoothed hess diagram is overplotted with a range of dartmouth isochrones ( * ? ?",
    "* red isochrones on figure  [ cmd]b ) .",
    "the isochrones are 12 gyr old and at a distance of 26 kpc .",
    "the left - most isochrone is the most metal - poor , [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.5 $ ] , while the right - most is the most metal rich , [ fe / h@xmath10=-0.5 $ ] .",
    "these values bracket the likely stream metallicity range , with the most probable value being the median [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.0 $ ] . if a range of 13 gyr isochrones is used , the inferred metallicity is lower [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.25 $ ] .",
    "a range of younger and more metal rich isochrones fails to match the shape of the overdensity in the hess diagram .",
    "given the proximity of the stream to the m33 galaxy , we have also overplotted a range of old and metal - poor isochrones at the distance of m33 ( 809 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to test whether the stream could be associated with the m33 system ( gray isochrones on figure  [ cmd]b ) .",
    "the tip of the red giant branch of that isochrone only reaches @xmath56 at @xmath57 , much redder than the stream feature .",
    "we conclude that the stream is not associated with m33 , but is most likely the tidal remnant of an old , metal - poor globular cluster in the milky way halo .",
    "= -0.5 $ ] to @xmath58 at the stream distance ( red ) and [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.1 $ ] to @xmath59 at the m33 distance ( gray ) . ]",
    "the triangulum stream is in a region of sky rich with substructure .",
    "while the stream is projected against the m31/m33 system , it has no spatial overlap with any of the m31 satellites @xcite or diffuse structures discovered around m33 ( marked with a dashed ellipse in figure  [ profile]d ) .",
    "the m33 population is more metal - poor ( @xmath60=-1.6 $ ] ; @xcite ) than the triangulum stream .",
    "thus , we believe that triangulum stream is a galactic feature , unassociated with the substructure in the m31/m33 system .    the largest milky way feature in this region is the diffuse triangulum - andromeda ( triand ) overdensity covering @xmath61 deg@xmath8 between @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "it was discovered by @xcite as a smooth overdensity of m - giants in the 2mass survey between @xmath64kpc .",
    "@xcite refined this distance estimate using main sequence turnoff stars to @xmath65 kpc .",
    "the mean spectroscopic metallicity of triand stars is [ fe / h@xmath10=-0.64\\pm0.08 $ ] , with a cmd inferred age of 8gyr @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of triand is higher than that inferred for the triangulum stream and we estimate a population which is 4gyr older .",
    "@xcite have detected a signature of another overdensity behind the triand , at heliocentric distance @xmath66kpc .",
    "both features are far more extended than triangulum , however , the triangulum stream could be related to these overdensities as a localized feature at the outer edge of a much larger diffuse merger remnant .",
    "spectroscopic and/or astrometric follow - up is required to explore this possibility .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the ` bifurcation ' in the sagittarius stream @xcite is in fact a distinct stream with its own progenitor and kinematics @xcite .",
    "the so - called cetus stream , first discovered by @xcite , is fainter , thinner and more metal - poor than the sagittarius stream .",
    "its derived orbit is in the direction of the triangulum stream , however , it has lower metallicity ( [ fe / h@xmath10=-2.1 $ ] ) and appears to be at larger heliocentric distance ( 34kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , we do not think that the triangulum stream is related to the monoceros ring / anticenter stellar structure / monoceros stream , which is the other prominent diffuse structure in the south .",
    "even though the latter structure ( whose origin remains controversial ) has a large metallicity spread from [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.6 $ ] to [ fe / h@xmath10=-0.4 $ ] that could be consistent with the stream discovered here , it seems to be at much closer heliocentric distance at @xmath67 kpc @xcite .",
    "we have searched the ssds dr8 photometric database for milky way stellar streams using a matched filtering technique .",
    "we recover all known streams in the current literature . based on a visual search of our stellar density maps , we present evidence for a new stream discovered in the southern galactic hemisphere in the direction of m33 which we name the triangulum stream .",
    "we did not find any other stream - like structures in the dataset .",
    "the triangulum stream spans @xmath2 by @xmath3 ( 75pc by 5.5kpc ) on the sky with a best fitting distance of @xmath4kpc .",
    "we estimate the age and metallicity of the stream via a statistically subtracted color - magnitude diagram of the region , which suggests a 12gyr , metal - poor ( [ fe / h@xmath10=-1.0 $ ] ) stellar population .",
    "the narrow width of the triangulum stream is comparable to the gd-1 and palomar  5 streams , from which we conclude that the triangulum stream is also a disrupted globular cluster .",
    "while we do not observe the progenitor object , the stream extends beyond the sdss photometric coverage .",
    "we note that the pandas team @xcite has independently detected the triangulum stream at the same sky position but at a higher significance due to deeper photometric data ( m.  fardal , priv .",
    "communication ) .",
    "searches for cold stellar streams in the halo are motivated by the desire to map the galactic gravitational potential . further characterizing the size and shape of the triangulum stream via deeper and more extended imaging",
    "will improve the usefulness of this stream as a galactic halo probe .",
