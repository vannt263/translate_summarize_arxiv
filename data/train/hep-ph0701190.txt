    "the final states include at least two ltps .",
    "the collider signal at lhc is large transverse missing energy @xmath2 , just like susy .",
    "this model predicts a set of new particles . amongst them , the heavy gauge bosons @xmath250 , the sm fermion partners @xmath251 , and the top partner @xmath252 are t - odd . in the following",
    ", @xmath253 denotes \\{@xmath254 } , @xmath255 denotes \\{@xmath256 } , @xmath18 denotes @xmath253 and @xmath255 .    no t - odd partner for the su(3 ) gauge boson",
    "is introduced . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay pattern of t - odd @xmath18 is similar to that of @xmath5 in susy . according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "about 60% of @xmath257 decays into @xmath258 , 100% of @xmath258 decays into @xmath259 and 25% of @xmath259 decays into leptons . therefore about 15% of @xmath257 decay leptonically .",
    "this decay pattern is similar to that of @xmath214 at point c. thus , for the lht model , we obtain susy - like signal as if there are only @xmath41 and @xmath260 production at lhc .",
    "although there is no t - channel colored particle exchange , @xmath32 is non zero due to the t - channel exchange of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . it is higher than that of the mssm because @xmath18 s are fermions .",
    "for example , @xmath261 is 0.7pb , @xmath262 is 0.15pb at @xmath263 and @xmath264gev , and @xmath261 is 0.2pb , @xmath262 is 0.04pb at @xmath265 and @xmath266gev .",
    "@xmath261 is @xmath267 times as large as @xmath268 at the mssm model points with the same mass scale ( see figure [ f4]a ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath269 is similar to @xmath270 of the mssm .",
    "the ratio @xmath271 of the lht is expected to be higher than that of the mssm , because @xmath34 production dominates the total susy production . as we will see later , the production cross sections and their ratios will help to distinguish the lht and the mssm .",
    "there are several models which predict a mssm - like collider signature with large @xmath2 .",
    "in section 2.2 we have shown that the @xmath11 production cross section changes significantly if the majorana mass contribution to the gluino mass is reduced in the model with an extended gluino sector .",
    "in particular , in the case of @xmath272 , @xmath9 can be reduced significantly compared to @xmath27 .    on the other hand , for the lht model",
    ", @xmath18 may have a similar decay pattern to @xmath5 while there is no particle corresponding to gluino .",
    "hence , the signal is similar than that of the mssm with an undetectably heavy gluino .",
    "@xmath273 is larger than @xmath33 by a factor of 5 .",
    "the signal cross sections of these models are different to those of the mssm , even if the mass spectrum is the same .",
    "therefore @xmath274 is one of the key observables for mssm studies .",
    "to identify @xmath11 production ( mainly @xmath21 production ) , @xmath275 events would be useful because @xmath276 @xmath277 @xmath278 . in this paper",
    ", we assume 100% of @xmath279 decays into q and the lsp @xmath151 .",
    "this is indeed realized over most of the msugra parameter space .",
    "however , in less constrained models neutralino mixing can be different , such that also @xmath279 has cascade decays involving the heavier neutralinos and charginos . in this case ,",
    "@xmath280 and @xmath24 production can both produce ss2@xmath1 events , and the following analyses are more complicated .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 is not so sensitive to the majorana nature of gluino , therefore it is more difficult to probe the majorana nature of the gluino using the ss2@xmath1 channel .",
    "we assume that the lsp @xmath151 is dominantly a bino and the @xmath281 a wino , so @xmath279 does not produce leptons .      .branching ratios of squarks and gluinos at point a@xmath51d .",
    "these are calculated by isajet . here",
    ", @xmath99 denotes \\{@xmath282 } , @xmath102 denotes the antiparticles of @xmath99 , @xmath279 denotes \\{@xmath283 } and their antiparticles .",
