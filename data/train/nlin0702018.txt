    "the fermi accelerator is a dynamical system , proposed by enrico fermi @xcite to describe cosmic ray acceleration , in which a charged particle collides with a time dependent magnetic field .",
    "with base in different applications , the original model was later modified and studied by other authors .",
    "one of them is the well known fermi - ulam model ( fum ) @xcite , in which a ball is confined between a rigid fixed wall and an oscillatory moving one . in this model",
    "the ball collides elastically with the walls and the system is described by an area preserving map . in high energies",
    "regime the phase space presents kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands surrounded by locally chaotic regions , which are limited by spanning curves . below the invariant spanning curve of lower energy",
    "a globally chaotic sea involves kam islands .",
    "the presence of invariant spanning curves limits the orbits in phase space impeding unlimited energy growth ( fermi acceleration ) @xcite .",
    "another model , very similar to fum , in which the ball is in a gravitational field , so - called bouncer @xcite , presents , differently from fum , the property of fermi acceleration depending on values of control parameter and initial conditions .",
    "this difference between the two models was later explained by lichtenberg et al @xcite .",
    "hybrid versions @xcite involving both fum and bouncer and versions of fum with energy dissipation @xcite were also explored .",
    "quantum models based on fum and bouncer have also been studied @xcite .",
    "the study of such systems is interesting because it allows to compare theoretical predictions with experimental results @xcite ; moreover the knowledge about how time - dependent perturbations affect the dynamics of hamiltonian systems is something that needs to be more explored .",
    "therefore it is useful to study such perturbations in simple models because they furnish insights about more complex systems ; even more , the formalism used in its characterization can be extended to the billiard class of problems @xcite .    the simplified fermi - ulam model ( sfum ) @xcite is an approximation in which the position of the _ moving wall _ is considered as _ fixed _ , but it transfers momentum and energy to the particle .",
    "this geometrical change of the complete model can be neglected when the amplitude of oscillation is much smaller than the distance between the two walls and the velocity of the particle is larger than the wall maximal velocity .",
    "it is clear that the simplified versions can speed up the simulations .",
    "however the main interest in these simplified models is that they can be studied by analytical methods whose results are often compared with the numerical results of the simplified model .",
    "moreover , these analytical results are , sometimes , also useful in study of the full models .",
    "the moving wall in the fermi - ulam model represents an external force that acts as a perturbation in the system .",
    "if the oscillation amplitude of the moving wall is zero the system is integrable but as soon as this amplitude is different from zero the fermi - ulam model behaves chaotically @xcite . near the integrable to non - integrable transition",
    ", average quantities can be described by scaling functions .",
    "this kind of analysis was originally proposed in a study of the sfum , where the collision number with the moving wall is employed as independent variable @xcite . in a recent work @xcite , also based on the sfum , we proposed a similar analysis in which time is considered as independent variable and we showed that the average energy can also be described by scaling functions but with a different exponents set .",
    "moreover , we showed that the average energy _ decays _ at long times .    in the present work we investigate the chaotic sea below the spanning curve of lowest energy for the full fermi - ulam model , where scaling properties of average energies are studied on variables _ time _ and _ iteration _ ( or _ collision _ )",
    "_ number_. we show that if the time is employed as independent variable , then the exponents related to the scaling properties of fum are not the same that the ones of sfum . however , if the iteration number is employed as independent variable , then both fum and sfum present the same set of exponents .",
    "we show that the energy decay found for long time in the sfum @xcite does not exist for the fum and we justify physically the origins of the similarities and differences between the fum and sfum .",
    "we provide also some analytical results for the scaling exponents and , moreover , we show that although the exponents related to the variables _ time _ and _ collision number _ are not the same a relation between them can be established .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section the fermi - ulam model and the average quantities of interest are defined .",
    "we present also the procedures to obtain these averages when time is the independent variable . in section",
    "iii we present the results of the numerical simulations , the scaling properties of average energies as function of both time and collision number , and we determine the exponents related to these averages . in section",
    "iv analytical arguments to determine some exponents and to derive a relation between the exponents of time and collision number analyses are discussed .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusions in section v , where we also present a summary of this present work .",
    "the fermi - ulam model describes the motion of a classical particle bouncing between two rigid walls , one of which is fixed at position @xmath7 and other that is moving periodically in time whose position is given by @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the equilibrium position , @xmath10 is the oscillation amplitude , @xmath11 is a frequency , @xmath12 is time and @xmath13 is the initial phase . in order to work with dimensionless variables we perform scale changes in length @xmath14 and in time @xmath15 . with these new variables",
    "the system has just one parameter , namely @xmath16 , and we write the position of the moving wall as @xmath17",
    ". the particle moves freely between the walls and collides elastically with them . in this manner",
    "the fum can be described by a map @xmath18 which gives the velocity of the particle and the phase of the moving wall immediately after each collision @xcite @xmath19    here the term @xmath20 gives the fraction of velocity gained or lost in collision and @xmath21 is the time between two collisions with the moving wall , which is given by the smallest solution of @xmath22 .",
    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    the plus sign in the above equations corresponds to the situation in which the particle collides with the fixed wall before hitting the moving one ( _ indirect collisions _ ) ; the minus sign corresponds to the situation in which the particle hits successively with the moving wall ( _ direct collisions _ or _ successive collisions _ ) .",
    "let us define @xmath23 as the square velocity at time @xmath24 .",
    "we are interested in the scaling properties of the dimensionless energy @xmath25 averaged over an ensemble of @xmath26 samples that belong to the chaotic sea .",
    "such samples are characterized by initial phases @xmath13 of the moving wall randomly chosen in an interval @xmath27 .",
    "if the initial velocity @xmath28 is small enough then we can use @xmath29 .",
    "moreover we consider that the particle starts at the fixed wall position with velocity @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the time of the first collision of the particle with the moving wall is given by @xmath31 and we define a variable @xmath1 as @xmath32 . in this way the time @xmath1 starts at the first collision instant and we write the average energy as @xmath33 where @xmath34 refers to a sample .",
    "we consider also another kind of average where the square velocity is firstly averaged over the orbit of a sample as @xmath35 and then we perform the average of the energy in an ensemble of @xmath26 samples as defined below @xmath36    as the particle moves freely between the walls , the square of its velocity is constant between two impacts with the moving wall and the integral in eq .",

    "the reasoning is basically to repeat the above procedure until @xmath44 and then to update the energy @xmath51 .",

    "moreover , we observe that the energy of the fum is constant up to a time @xmath45 , grows to a time @xmath67 and , then , reaches a stationary value . in the sfum the average energy , differently of fum , presents a slow decay for large @xmath1 ( @xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "this striking result is a consequence of the approximation used to define the sfum .",
    "as the oscillating wall is considered fixed in space , the time between collisions is @xmath190 and successive collisions do not occur .",
    "therefore , eventually after a collision with the moving wall , the particle has very low velocity @xmath54 and remains for a long time ( @xmath190 ) with low energy , originating a slow decay in energy for @xmath70 . in the full model it is different : if after a collision with the moving wall the particle losses almost all its energy , then a successive collision occurs increasing the energy of the particle and the decay in energy at @xmath70 is not observed . the analyses on variable @xmath2 furnish basically the same results for both fum and sfum because between one arbitrary collision and the next one we always have that @xmath191 , independently if the collisions are direct ( successive ) or indirect .    summarizing , we employed scaling analyses to describe the properties of average energies as function of @xmath1 and as function of @xmath2 in regime of small amplitudes of oscillation of the moving wall , @xmath192 , for the full fermi - ulam model .",
    "we observe that i ) the scaling exponents related to the variables @xmath0 and @xmath28 are basically the same for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 analyses , namely , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "ii ) we also observe that the scaling exponents related to the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not the same , @xmath179 and @xmath182 , respectively , and , by a simple analytical reasoning , we show that these exponents are connected by the relation @xmath178 .",
    "iii ) performing some analytical analyses on variable @xmath2 we derive that @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "iv ) considering also the results of the simplified fermi - ulam model , @xcite and @xcite , we observe that the scaling analyses of fum and sfum on variable @xmath1 are characterized by different exponents sets , while the analyses on variable @xmath2 furnish , basically , the same exponents set for both fum and sfum .",
    "v ) we observe also that the successive collisions play an important rule when the fermi - ulam model is studied on variable @xmath1 by , mainly , preventing the energy decay for long times .",
    "vi ) in the analysis on variable @xmath2 direct ( successive ) and indirect collisions play a similar rule and , therefore , the energy curves as function of @xmath2 present , for both fum and sfum , the same behavior and they are described by a single set of scaling exponents .    we thank to j.a .",
