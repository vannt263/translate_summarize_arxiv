    "this discrepancy between the classical spiral state and the collinear state observed experimentally has been reported for li@xmath13cuw@xmath13o@xmath14 as well  @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations inherent to the spin-@xmath16 cu@xmath8 compound are a natural mechanism for stabilizing the collinear state , but in li@xmath13niw@xmath13o@xmath14 the large ordered moment renders this possibility unlikely . on the other hand , the single - ion anisotropy @xmath78k favors the collinear state and overcomes the effect of frustration .",
    "it is worth noting that this mechanism is not operative in the cu compound , where single - ion anisotropy vanishes for a spin-@xmath16 ion .",
    "the single - ion anisotropy is comparable to the leading exchange coupling , @xmath87 in li@xmath13niw@xmath13o@xmath14 , while in csnicl@xmath20 this ratio is 0.04 only  @xcite .",
    "the pronounced anisotropy combined with the frustration on the triangular lattice may also be responsible for the formation of the incommensurate order between @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "the competition between the commensurate and incommensurate states is reminiscent of ca@xmath20co@xmath13o@xmath9 that shows a peculiar sequence of magnetization plateaus in the applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
