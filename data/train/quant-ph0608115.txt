    "we thank j. w. allen , f. capasso , m. killi , j. b. pendry , s. scheel and t. tyc for their comments and the leverhulme trust for financial support .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the casimir force for a dispersive medium in our set - up . for this",
    ", we use the generalization @xcite of lifshitz classic theory of the casimir force in media @xcite-@xcite .",
    "first , we express the electromagnetic force density @xmath31 of the quantum vacuum in terms of the quantum expectation value @xmath32 of maxwell s stress tensor @xcite , @xmath33 the vacuum stress turns out to be infinite , but not its divergence , if we adopt the following regularization procedure : consider instead of the expectation value of the stress tensor the more general correlation function @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the three  dimensional unity matrix , @xmath36 describes the tensor product of two vectors ( a matrix @xmath37 with components @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 denotes the trace of three - dimensional matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath40 is defined as the expectation value @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the permittivity of the vacuum . as we will see , @xmath43 is finite for @xmath44 and approaches infinity for @xmath45 , but the infinite contribution @xmath46 to @xmath43 does not exert any electromagnetic force , because @xmath47 turns out to vanish .",
    "therefore , the part of the vacuum stress that really appears as a force is finite and given by @xmath48 second , we express the correlation functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 in terms of the classical electromagnetic green s function @xmath51 .",
    "the green s function is proportional to the electric field @xmath52 of a single external dipole placed at position @xmath53 where it oscillates with frequency @xmath54 .",
    "the dipole generates electromagnetic radiation that probes the properties of the medium .",
    "this dipolar probe may point in three possible spatial directions ; and so the green s function is a matrix where each column corresponds to any of the directions of the dipole .",
    "mathematically , the green s function is defined as the solution of the inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation @xmath55 where , in general , the fourier - transformed electric permittivity @xmath0 and magnetic permeability @xmath1 are complex functions of @xmath54 . in the limit of large frequencies",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to unity  all media are transparent to electromagnetic waves with extremely short wavelengths . both @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy the crossing relations @xmath56 and , due to causality @xcite , the dielectric functions are analytic on the upper half plane .    according to the quantum theory of light in dispersive and dissipative media @xcite-@xcite , we can express the correlations functions ( [ tau ] ) in the vacuum stress ( [ sigma ] ) as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 indicates that differentiations are performed from the right .",
    "the green s function is evaluated for purely imaginary frequencies @xmath59 , because here the integrals ( [ eebb ] ) converge nicely , in general .",
    "note that for purely imaginary frequencies the dielectric functions are real , because of the crossing property ( [ cross ] ) , and so is the green s function .",
    "consider a uniform medium where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are constant in space .",
    "in this case , we represent the electromagnetic green s function @xmath60 in terms of the scalar green s function @xmath61 that obeys the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath62 we use the identity @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and see that the solution of the electromagnetic wave equation ( [ gwave ] ) is @xmath65 uniform media do not feel the force of the quantum vacuum  otherwise they would disintegrate ; but the green s function and hence the vacuum stress approaches infinity for @xmath66 .",
    "the infinity of the green s function for uniform media characterizes the infinity in the non - uniform case , because , around the singularity of the delta function in the wave equation ( [ gwave ] ) we can assume the medium to be uniform ; the dominant , diverging contribution to @xmath67 is given by the uniform green s function ( [ g0 ] ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . on the other hand , we know that this contribution does not generate a force . in this way",
    ", we arrive at a simple recipe for removing the most severely infinite but physically insignificant contribution @xmath70 from the correlation function ( [ sigma ] ) : @xmath70 is constructed from the uniform green s function ( [ g0 ] ) taking the local values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath71 .",
    "equivalently , we can remove the uniform green s functions from the integrals ( [ eebb ] ) without changing the vacuum force .",
    "consider the casimir set - up illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : left ] with a left - handed metamaterial sandwiched between the two mirrors . in order to describe the influence of dispersion in the simplest possible way",
    ", we use a simple toy model : we assume that the medium acts as a transformation medium for all frequencies , @xmath72 but the transformation depends on frequency . physically , this medium corresponds to the impedance - matched permittivity and permeability tensors @xcite @xmath73 although the medium ( [ lens ] ) performs the coordinate transformation ( [ trans ] ) , the green s function @xmath67 is not the transformed green s function of the empty casimir cavity , because the source on the right - hand side of the inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation ( [ gwave ] ) , the current of the dipolar probe , is not transformed according to the rules @xcite . for example",
    "the green s function ( [ gwave ] ) for the infinitely extended anisotropic transformation medium ( [ lens ] ) ( without the cavity plates ) is @xmath74 where @xmath61 is written in transformed coordinates @xmath75 , and the @xmath76 refers to the sign of @xmath0 . the green s function ( [ gtrans ] ) is not the transformed uniform green s function ( [ g0 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , after solving the wave equation ( [ gwave ] ) with the boundary conditions at the cavity plates , subtracting the vacuum green s function and calculating the correlation functions ( [ eebb ] ) we obtain the surprisingly simple result @xmath77 lifshitz formula @xcite in terms of the transformed cavity distance @xmath78 the medium thus changes the effective cavity size in the casimir stress according to the transformations ( [ trans ] ) ; but , of course , the cavity size @xmath14 depends on frequency . note that the off - diagonal components of the stress tensor vanish due to the symmetry of our set - up . inside the casimir cavity , the vacuum stress is constant , but not isotropic .",
    "outside of the cavity , the green s function @xmath67 vanishes , and so does the stress tensor .",
    "consequently , @xmath32 jumps from zero to diag@xmath79 at the inner surface of the casimir plates . the force density @xmath80 gives a delta function at the surface and points in positive @xmath4 direction at the left plate and in negative @xmath4 direction at the right plate , if @xmath14 is positive .",
    "in this case , the vacuum stress causes an attractive force towards the interior .    in the case of negative @xmath81 the effective cavity size ( [ size ] ) is negative and so the lifshitz integral ( [ lifshitz ] ) diverges , despite our regularization procedure that has removed the principal singularity of the vacuum stress ; but this additional divergence of ( [ lifshitz ] ) does not contribute to the casimir force either , because @xmath82 the integral of the first term converges and the diverging integral of @xmath83 does not depend on the cavity at all .",
    "furthermore , the casimir force changes sign , from attraction to repulsion , in agreement with our simple argument in the main part of this paper .    adopting this additional regularization procedure in spectral regions where @xmath14 is negative ,",
    "we express the casimir force as @xmath84 to solve the remaining integral for @xmath85 , we use eq .  2.3.14.5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , vol .",
    "i , and obtain @xmath86 in terms of the polylogarithms @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : poly ] shows that the kernel @xmath85 is peaked around zero with a width of roughly @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath14 is negative , but does not vary much for purely imaginary frequencies in the spectral region until @xmath89 , we obtain the repulse casimir force ( [ eq : casimir ] ) , the main quantitative result of this paper .",
    "however , negative @xmath81 for positively imaginary frequencies are impossible in absorptive dielectrics @xcite ; they can only occur in media with gain .",
    "in absorptive media the imaginary part of @xmath0 is positive for real frequencies @xmath54 . in this case ,",
    "causality  the analyticity of @xmath90 on the upper half plane  implies that @xmath81 is positive , see ref .",
    "@xcite ,  123 . on the other hand , consider a medium with a single spectral line of gain described by the simple drude model @xcite @xmath91 in the limit of vanishing , but positive gain @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig : drude ] illustrates the resonance in @xmath90 and the behavior of @xmath81 for positively imaginary frequencies where @xmath0 remains @xmath93 over a sufficiently large range of the spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : force ] illustrates the remarkable accuracy of the simple prediction ( [ eq : casimir ] ) for the casimir force in comparison with the lifshitz theory for dispersive dielectrics with gain .",
    "one might object that the permittivity tensor ( [ lens ] ) for a transformation medium has singularities on the upper half plane ; and hence the medium is not causal .",
    "however , all that really enters our simple model is the assumption that the medium performs the transformation ( [ trans ] ) over the relevant range of purely imaginary frequencies ; the medium may deviate from the transformation rule ( [ lens ] ) in the vicinity of a zero in @xmath81 , which results in a more complicated expression for the vacuum stress , but produces , in very good approximation , the same result .",
    "moreover , we can relax the assumption that the medium is impedance - matched and still obtain a repulsive casimir force , even without gain , as long as @xmath94 is greater than @xmath81 for purely imaginary frequencies over a sufficiently large spectral range .",
    "this is achieved , for example , by setting @xmath95 so that there is just a magnetic response in the material , the permeability being given by a drude formula .",
    "if we consider the geometrical arrangement of fig .",
    "[ fig : levitation ] , where the material is in contact with the lower mirror , then the vertical vacuum stress at the upper mirror turns out to be @xmath96   +         2\\,e^{-2\\left(a- b   \\right ) w }         \\left (   lw\\varepsilon   - ks \\right )          \\left (   kw\\mu   - ls     \\right )   } { 8      \\left ( kns + lmw\\varepsilon   \\right ) \\left ( lms + knw\\mu   \\right ) } \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\    k&=&\\sinh(bs ) , \\quad l=\\cosh(bs ) , \\quad m=\\sinh\\left[(a - b)w\\right ] , \\quad n=\\cosh\\left[(a - b)w\\right ] \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\        w^2 & = & u^2 + \\xi^2c^{-2 } \\ , , \\quad s^2 = u^2 + \\varepsilon\\mu\\xi^2c^{-2 }   \\ , .",
    "\\label{magstress}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : magnetic ] shows that the casimir force is repulsive when the distance @xmath97 between the material and the upper mirror is of the order @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the resonance frequency in the drude formula ( [ magnetic ] ) .",

    "<S> the closely related case of repulsive van der waals forces has been studied as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a different situation inspired by casimir s original idea @xcite : imagine instead of two extended dielectric plates two perfect conductors with a metamaterial sandwiched in between for which @xmath2 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",

    "<S> one of the conducting plates may be very thin and movable , which gives a key advantage in observing repulsive vacuum forces .    ]    in the following we develop a visual argument why the casimir force in this set - up is repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the fact that a slab of a metamaterial with @xmath2 acts as a transformation medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transformation media @xcite map electromagnetic fields in physical space to the electromagnetism of empty flat space . </S>",
    "<S> such media are at the heart of macroscopic invisibility devices @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that electromagnetic analogues of the event horizon @xcite are also manifestations of transformation media @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a transformation medium performs an active coordinate transformation : electromagnetism in physical space , including the effect of the medium , is equivalent to electromagnetism in transformed coordinates where space appears to be empty . </S>",
    "<S> the sole function of the device is to facilitate this transformation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a metamaterial with @xmath2 of thickness @xmath3 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) transforms the cartesian coordinate @xmath4 into @xmath5 as @xcite ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) @xmath6 this transformation property of the medium visually explains @xcite that the material acts as a perfect lens @xcite : the electromagnetic field in the range @xmath7 is mapped into @xmath5 , but @xmath5 has two more images in physical space , one inside the device and one in @xmath8 . since these are faithful transformations the images are perfect . </S>",
    "<S> note that the transformed coordinate system @xmath9 is left - handed @xcite within the material , which also explains why media with @xmath2 create left - handed electromagnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence they are called left - handed metamaterials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that this medium is sandwiched between a casimir cavity of two perfect conductors with distance @xmath10 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . in transformed space </S>",
    "<S> the plate - distance appears as ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) @xmath11 suppose that @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ the casimir plates lie within the imaging range of the perfect lens . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the cavity in physical space increases when the transformed cavity decreases . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the attractive casimir force in transformed space turns into a repulsive force in physical space .    in order to derive a quantitative result for the casimir force </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the electromagnetic spectrum @xmath13 of the left - handed casimir cavity is the spectrum of an empty cavity with distance @xmath14 where @xmath15 refers to all possible modes that fit into the transformed cavity . </S>",
    "<S> each mode corresponds to a quantum harmonic oscillator with ground - state energy @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the total zero - point energy @xmath17 , the sum of all @xmath16 , is infinite , but differences between @xmath18 per area , @xmath19 , for different plate distances are finite @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gradient of the zero - point energy causes a force that becomes observable when one plate is movable , the casimir force @xcite . for empty cavities , </S>",
    "<S> this force is well - known and has been experimentally observed @xcite . in our case , the cavity has an effective length of @xmath14 , but a mechanical length of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the standard result for casimir cavities @xcite and obtain the force per area @xmath20 in our argument we made the implicit assumption that the metamaterial performs the left - handed transformation ( [ eq : left ] ) on electromagnetic modes over a sufficient frequency range , whereas the negatively - refracting metamaterials of present technology have been highly dispersive @xcite-@xcite . in the appendix we consider the lifshitz theory @xcite-@xcite of the casimir effect in dispersive materials . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transformation medium is only required to act as a perfect lens for purely imaginary frequencies that correspond to wavelengths comparable to or larger than @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> however , such imaginary perfect lenses are only possible in media with gain @xcite , _ i.e. _ in active metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> we give an example that agrees very well with our simple result ( [ eq : casimir ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect that the force ( [ eq : casimir ] ) diverges for @xmath22 , when the perfect lens images the two plates into each other , because no medium can sustain @xmath23 for arbitrarily short or arbitrarily long wavelengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also show in the appendix that passive metamaterials with negative @xmath1 , but positive @xmath0 , exhibit a repulsive casimir force , that quantitatively differs from formula ( [ eq : casimir ] ) , but not qualitatively . </S>",
    "<S> such metamaterials can be made with present technology .    </S>",
    "<S> we may speculate how strong the repelling force of the quantum vacuum may become . </S>",
