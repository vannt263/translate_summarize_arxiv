    "iras  16293@xmath12422 is one of the best studied low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite .",
    "it is deeply embedded in the ldn  1689n cloud in ophiuchus ( distance 160  pc ) and classified as an extreme class i / class 0 yso @xcite .",
    "it is a low - luminosity ( 27  @xmath23 , @xcite ) binary system ( hereafter , i16293a and i16293b ) with a separation of 840  au ( @xmath24 ) and individual stellar masses of 0.5  m@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "two powerful outflows emanate from the system .",
    "at least three physically and chemically different regions can be recognised in a @xmath25 ( 3000  au ) beam @xcite : ( i ) a cold , relatively low - density outer envelope ( @xmath261020  k , @xmath27(h@xmath28@xmath29 @xmath30 ) which marks the transition into the extended parental cloud ldn  1689n ; ( ii ) a warmer circumbinary envelope of size @xmath31  au ( @xmath32  k , @xmath27(h@xmath33@xmath34  @xmath30 ) ; and ( iii ) a warm , dense core of about 5001500  au ( @xmath35 k , @xmath27(h@xmath36 @xmath30 ) which traces the interaction of the outflow and the stellar radiation with the inner part of the circumbinary envelope .",
    "this picture emerged from excitation analysis of species tracing these distinct regions and conditions , assuming uniform temperatures and densities for each .",
    "continuous descriptions of the density and temperature as function of radius in the collapsing envelope were developed by @xcite and @xcite on scales from 30 to 5000  au . in this paper , we present new observations and modeling , that allows us to independently derive the density and temperature structure in the extended envelope around the ( pre- ) protostellar cores through continuum photometry and imaging of the dust , and heterodyne spectroscopy of the molecular gas . the resulting density and temperature distribution ranges from the warm inner envelope region ( 100  au ) to the coldest ( 12  k ) outer envelope regions ( 7300  au ) and serves as a basis for excitation and abundance analysis of the line data .",
    "another component of the iras  16293@xmath12422 system is located 80@xmath37 east and 60@xmath37 south of i16293a .",
    "this small clump , i16293e , has strong dco@xmath2 , nh@xmath38 , and nh@xmath4d emission @xcite connected to the i16293a core , and significant submillimeter continuum emission from dust @xcite .",
    "single - dish observations of nh@xmath38 in a @xmath39 beam indicate a temperature @xmath40  k @xcite .",
    "millimeter - interferometric data , sampling smaller scales and less sensitive to the warmer extended envelope , yield @xmath41  k and @xmath42 @xmath30 if homogeneous conditions are assumed @xcite . because no far - infrared ( fir ) or submillimeter point source has been found embedded in i16293e , it is classified as a pre-(proto)stellar core . in this paper , we present submillimeter images that constrain the density structure of i16293e .",
    "it is difficult to study chemical evolution in the early protostellar stages , because during collpase the temperature stays low at @xmath43  k while the density increases to @xmath44h@xmath45 @xmath30 . under these conditions",
    "the line emission of many molecules is dominated by a warmer outer envelope around the prestellar core .",
    "also , many molecules in the cold core will condense on dust grains .",
    "eventually , only h@xmath4 , h@xmath46 , and their isotopomers hd and h@xmath4d@xmath2 will remain in the gas phase .",
    "this leads to a significant enhancement of h@xmath4d@xmath2 through the deuterium exchange reaction @xmath47 since the backward reaction becomes negligible at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "h@xmath4d@xmath2 is thought to play a pivotal role in the deuteration of molecules @xcite and the detection of h@xmath4d@xmath2 in the class  0 yso ngc  1333 iras  4a @xcite is an important confirmation of the cold gas - phase chemical networks .",
    "the h@xmath4d@xmath2 enhancement is reflected in the high abundance ratios that are generally observed of , e.g. , [ dco@xmath2]/[hco@xmath2 ] , [ nh@xmath4d]/[nh@xmath38 ] , [ dcn]/[hcn ] , and [ n@xmath4d@xmath2]/[n@xmath4h@xmath2 ] in cold prestellar cores and class  0 ysos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "models predict that in the collapse stage the abundances of many deuterated radicals and molecules increase sharply after their non - deuterated versions start to get heavily depleted on dust grains , then reach a peak and start to decrease as the deuterated molecules too condense on the dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "reactions with atomic deuterium on the grain surface may further enhance the abundance of deuterated species in the ice @xcite .",
    "after the formation of a yso , the condensed molecules may evaporate from grains , resulting in a temporary increase in the gas - phase deuteration fraction .",
    "the deuteration may decline after @xmath50 years @xcite when higher temperature chemistry becomes effective .",
    "in addition , in such hot ( @xmath51200 k ) regions the reversal of reaction ( [ e1 ] ) becomes dominant and very little new fractionation is expected to occur .",
    "we report in this paper observations of several key deuterated species in i16293a and i16293e .",
    "water is an important species in the early stages of star formation .",
    "h@xmath4o is the most important hydride molecule in oxygen chemistry and models predict that h@xmath4o plays a dominant role in the energy balance and chemical evolution during star formation .",
    "water will have the largest abundance and excitation contrast between the protostellar source and the surrounding cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of the rotational and ro - vibrational transitions of h@xmath4o in star - forming regions have recently become available from the infared space observatory ( iso ; e.g. , @xcite ) and the submillimeter wave astronomical satellite ( swas ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular the heterodyne velocity - resolved measurements of the ground - state transition of ortho - h@xmath4o with swas allow a direct determination of the water abundance throughout the envelope .",
    "the hdo @xmath5@xmath6 ground - state transition at 465  ghz ( @xmath52 k , @xmath53 @xmath30 for @xmath54 k , @xcite ) is an excellent tracer of high density gas at low temperatures where the abundance of hdo relative to water is enhanced .",
    "ground - based observations of the hdo ground - state transition are still very sparse . to date , this transition has only been observed in the high - mass star - forming regions orion - kl @xcite , w3(oh ) , and w3(h@xmath4o ) @xcite .",
    "the latter study indicates that the [ hdo]/[h@xmath4o ] abundance ratio is comparable to that found in hot cores and is not a sensitive indicator of the evolutionary stage in high - mass star formation .",
    "this could mean either that the w3 cloud always stayed warm or that the [ hdo]/[h@xmath4o ] ratio retrusn to thermal equilibrium faster than ratios like [ dcn]/[hcn ] @xcite . for a low - mass class  0 yso like i16293a",
    "the situation may be different , because the time scale to reach steady - state may be much longer . in this paper , we present observations of hdo and h@xmath4o of i16293a and e.    in this paper we present a detailed study of the physical and chemical structure of the low - mass star - forming cloud ldn  1689n with particular emphasis on the h@xmath4o / hdo chemistry and deuterium fractionation .",
    "we present extensive submillimeter continuum photometry and maps revealing the warm and cold dust around i16293a , b and i16293e (  [ obs_cont ] ) .",
    "we report the detection of the ground - state lines of ( deuterated ) water and a tentative detection of h@xmath4d@xmath2 toward i16293a as well as weak hdo emission in the prestellar core i16293e (  [ obs_line ] ) .",
    "these data are combined with pointed observations of co and hco@xmath2 isotopomers to determine the temperature and density structure throughout the envelope (  [ results ] ) .",
    "we address the two outflows and their origin in ",
    "[ co_outflows ] .",
    "our deep observations of the hdo and h@xmath4o ground - state transitions are used to study the [ hdo]/[h@xmath4o ] ratio throughout the envelope (  [ hdo_h2o ] ) .",
    "a simple chemistry network is used to model the deuterium chemistry and in particular the water fractionation (  [ simple_chem_model ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the evolutionary difference between i16293a , i16293b , and i16293e (  [ nature_of ] ) , and summarize the conclusions in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "all continuum observations were made with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , using the single channel bolometer ukt14 and the versatile submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) under good weather conditions .",
    "the ukt14 measurements were done during the winters of 19911993 .",
    "this instrument was for a long time the common - user bolometer system and is described in @xcite .",
    "it was replaced in 1997 by scuba which was designed both for photometry and fast mapping @xcite .",
    "the photometry of i16293e was done with ukt14 during spring 1993 .",
    "the chop throw was 90@xmath37  in declination and the calibrators were uranus and the nearby secondary calibration standard i16293a @xcite .",
    "the results are given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "ukt14 maps were obtained at 1.1 mm , 800 , 750 , 450 , and 350during several observing runs in 1991 and 1992 .",
    "most of these maps have poor sensivitity and were mainly used to derive the submillimeter position of i16293a .",
    "however , even with the somewhat limited signal - to - noise ( s / n ) these provide a better estimate of the background subtracted flux of i@xmath55a than single position photometry .    at 800",
    "we attempted to go deep and completely map the dust cloud surrounding the bright submillimeter source . because the dust emission is very extended ( see the 850 @xmath0 m scuba map in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) we combined six maps of the region , centered on i16293a or i16293e .",
    "each map was bound by pointing observations of the nearby blazars 1514@xmath1241 and 1730@xmath1130 .",
    "typical pointing drifts were less than 2@xmath37 .",
    "these errors were removed in the data reduction process assuming that the pointing drifts linearly in azimuth and elevation as a function of time .",
    "all maps were made on - the - fly , scanned in azimuth with a cell size of 4@xmath37  and a chop throw of 40@xmath37  in the scan direction . with a single pixel instrument",
    "it is difficult to map such an extended region .",
    "the final map was therefore reduced with the dual beam maximum entropy ( dbmem ) algorithm written by john richer @xcite for jcmt .",
    "the dbmem map was baseline subtracted and recalibrated by using the integrated intensity in a @xmath56 area around i16293a from maps reduced with nod2 @xcite .",
    "the 800-map is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( top panel ) . from comparison with scuba maps ( see below ) , it is clear that the 800-map has failed to recover the faint , relatively uniform , low - level emission surrounding both cloud cores",
    ". this does not affect the morphology of the map , but does have a large effect on integrated intensities of the surrounding ldn  1689n cloud .",
    "the low - level emission is missing because the 800-maps were taken with the same rather short chop throw , and the individual maps have a noise level comparable or higher to that of the low - level extended emission .",
    "it is also well known that the nod2-algorithm is not very sensitive to relatively uniform extended emission on spatial scales of several times the chop throw @xcite .",
    "additional maps were obtained with scuba during spring 1997 as part of commissioning jiggle- and scan - map observing modes .",
    "we have complemented these maps with additional maps obtained from the jcmt archive in the time period 19971998 .",
    "all maps were taken under excellent sky conditions ( atmospheric opacities @xmath57 ) , and all the maps in the archive were taken with a 120@xmath37chop throw , typically in azimuth .",
    "most of the maps of i16293e were also obtained with a 120@xmath37  chop .",
    "the pointing was checked before and after each map using the same blazars as for our ukt14 observations .",
    "some of the archive maps , however , were taken without pointing observations .",
    "these were aligned with the pointing corrected average before adding them into the final data set .",
    "calibration and beam characterization is based on beam maps of uranus obtained with the same chop throw .",
    "the uranus maps give a half power beam width of 14.5@xmath37  and 7.8@xmath37  for 850 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m , respectively .    both the i16293a , b and i16293e cloud cores are rather extended and no map is completely free of emission in the off positions .",
    "any bolometer that showed evidence for or was suspected of being contaminated by the chop was therefore blanked in the data reduction .",
    "although this was done as carefully as possible , it is clear that the outskirts of our final mosaiced image ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) may still be affected , especially since the dust emission extends beyond the area we mapped to the north and northeast of both i16293a and i16293e .",
    "the cloud core surrounding i16293e also extends further east than is covered by our maps .",
    "the basic data reduction was done using the scuba software reduction package surf @xcite as explained in the scuba map reduction cookbook @xcite . in total",
    "we used 16 data sets for the 850 @xmath0 m map and 13 for the 450 @xmath0 m map . in the final coadd we adjust the pointing in each map ( shift and add ) to ensure that the final map is not broadened by small pointing errors .",
    "the rms noise levels in the final maps are difficult to estimate , because there are no emission - free regions in the maps , but we estimate them to be below 20 mjy  beam@xmath10 at 850 @xmath0 m and below 80 mjy  beam@xmath10 at 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "the final maps were converted to fits and exported to miriad @xcite for further analysis . in order to correct for the error beam contribution , especially at 450 @xmath0 m , we deconvolved the maps using clean and spherically symmetric model beams derived from beam maps of uranus observed in stable night time conditions . at 850 @xmath0",
    "m we use hpbws of 14.5@xmath37 , 55@xmath37 , and 150@xmath37 , with amplitudes of 0.985 , 0.014 and 0.001 , respectively . at 450",
    "@xmath0 m the hpbws are 7.8@xmath37 , 34@xmath37 , and 140@xmath37 , with amplitudes of 0.964 , 0.029 , and 0.007 , respectively .",
    "the final maps were restored with a 14@xmath37beam at 850 and an 8@xmath37  beam at 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "the peak flux densities in the restored maps are 16.0 jy  beam@xmath10 and 76.1 jy  beam@xmath10 toward i16293a at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m , respectively , while the peak fluxes of i16293e are 1.4 jy  beam@xmath10 and 4.35 jy  beam@xmath10 at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "spectra of co @xmath15=21 ( 230.538000 ghz ) and isotopomers , as well as the @xmath15=32 transitions of dco@xmath2 ( 216.112605 ghz ) , hco@xmath2 ( 267.557619 ghz ) , and h@xmath3co@xmath2 ( 260.255478 ghz ) toward i16293a and i16293e were retrieved and reduced from a search of all released data in the jcmt archive at the canadian astronomy data center taken with the sis receiver rxa2 and its successor rxa3 .",
    "deep observations of the hdo @xmath58@xmath59 ( 225.896720 ghz ) and @xmath60@xmath59 ( 241.561550 ghz ) lines were made with the receiver rxa3 in 2001  april .",
    "we also acquired a large , fully sampled map in the co 21 line which is centered on i16293e and covers the outflows from i16293a and b. the map was made on - the - fly with a bandwidth of 125  mhz , a sampling of 5  in the scan direction , and a cross - scan step size of 10 .",
    "the final map was made from a series of sub - maps scanned either in ra or dec .",
    "the integration time per point was 5 seconds , but in poor weather conditions we often made multiple coverages .",
    "all observations were done in position switch mode with the reference position 600@xmath37  or 800@xmath37  west of the submillimeter position of i16293e . at the same time",
    "we have also obtained spectra toward i16293a , which is a pointing and spectral line standard .",
    "the relative calibration of the spectra of the co 21 map is accurate within 5% , because we overlapped the sub - maps . in 1999",
    "april we obtained additional deep spectra of co and @xmath3co 21 ( 220.398677 ghz ) at the peak positions in the outflow lobes in order to get more accurate estimates of the @xmath61co optical depth in the high velocity gas .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained with a bandwidth of 125  mhz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.1 km  s@xmath10 .",

    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] .",
    "the results of gaussian fits to the line profiles are summarised in table [ t2 ] .",
    "for some of the lines with symmetric profiles ( e.g. , hdo ) the emission and the absorption components were fitted separately . for most of the complex line profiles we only list the integrated emission and the velocity of the maximum self - absorption .",
    "note that the phase - lock instability of rxa2 and rxa3 may cause an instrumental broadening up to 0.5 km  s@xmath10 .",

    "the receiver was operated in single side band ( ssb ) mode where the image side band is rejected and terminates in a cold load .",
    "the main beam efficiency at these frequencies is about 60% , while the beam width is 1413@xmath37for 345372 ghz .",
    "the lines were observed in beamswitching mode switching over 180@xmath37 .",
    "the n@xmath4h@xmath2 and h@xmath4d@xmath2 lines were observed simultaneously with relatively good atmospheric transparency ( @xmath64 ) , but with only 30 minutes of useful integration time above an elevation of 40 degrees .",
    "rxb3 was changed to tunerless mixers in 1999 and the performance near the upper band edge has decreased dramatically with respect to @xcite . nevertheless we have tentatively detected the h@xmath4d@xmath2 ground - state line ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .    the hdo @xmath15=@xmath5@xmath6 ground - state transition ( 464.924520 ghz ) was observed in 1998  july at the jcmt during a night of excellent submillimeter transparency with a zenith optical depth at 225 ghz below 0.05 .",
    "the dual channel , dual band 460/660 ghz sis receiver rxw was used in ssb mode with the digital autocorrelator spectrometer ( das ) backend .",

    "the hdo line was observed in the upper side band , and ssb system temperatures including atmospheric losses were @xmath65 k. the beam size is about 11@xmath37 at 465 ghz and the main beam efficiency was measured to be about 50% .",

    "@xcite claim that their high resolution maps show that the dust emission is aligned with the binary .",
    "however , considering the s / n in their map , one could equally well interpret their result as a circumstellar disk surrounding a with a position angle similar to that seen in c@xmath82o and 450 @xmath0 m , and b as a separate but partly overlapping source .",
    "their observations show that about 90% of the dust emission surrounding a is spatially extended , while b is largely unresolved at all spatial scales they could measure .",

    "we conclude that the submillimeter dust continuum and most of the molecular emission are centered on a and have a disk - like morphology .",
    "the dust disk is surrounded by faint extended emission from the surrounding dark cloud core which falls off rather rapidly toward the south and southwest .",
    "the dark cloud core is more extended toward the north and northeast ( @xmath85@xmath37 ) , and in the west a narrow dust bridge connects it to i16293e ( see fig .",

    "this source size was used to convert our photometry into integrated intensities for further analysis .",
    "the submillimeter maps allow us to derive a mass estimate for the dust which is more accurate than previous values .",

    "although some of our ukt14 maps have relatively poor s / n , they still allow us to make a reliable estimate of the flux density of the compact dust disk , because the underlying emission from the envelope can be determined and subtracted .",

    "[ t1 ] we list the integrated fluxes for i16293a from two - dimensional gaussian fits to our maps after subtraction of the extended envelope emission . we have not mapped the region at 1.3  mm , but instead use data from @xcite who derived the integrated flux in a similar fashion .    we could use the scuba data together with co - added iras data at 100 and 60  to constrain the dust temperature , but it is clear from our submillimeter maps that the arcmin size of the iras beam will also include emission from the surrounding dark cloud , so to include the iras data we should do a two component fit and simultaneously solve for the dust envelope and the disk .",
    "instead , we take a simpler approach .",
    "we solve for each separately and use the iras data to make sure that the results we get are plausible .",
    "our deep 850 and 450 scuba maps predict that about half or more of the continuum emission seen by iras is likely to come from the envelope surrounding the dust disk .",
    "we therefore divide the iras 100  emission into halves and assume one half to originate in a compact @xmath88@xmath37  disk and the rest from a cooler cloud envelope around the protostar .",

    "our fit appears to slightly overestimate the flux densities at long wavelengths , which indicates that the data can not completely be described by a single dust temperature .",

    "[ f1 ] and [ f4 ] ) clearly show that the dust emission associated with the free - free and millimeter - source i16293a is extended .",
    "this is one of the few ysos where we can resolve the dust emission : it has a disk - like structure with a size of roughly 2000  au . at low frequencies the continuum emission from i16293a splits up into a double source .",
    "we do not believe that i16293a is in itself a binary ; a more plausible interpretion is that we are seeing highly collimated ionized gas from the outflow , as has been seen in l1551  irs5 @xcite , where the jet dominates the emission at low frequencies and the disk emission becomes dominant at high frequencies .",
    "these are strong arguments for an accretion disk that is centered on i16293a and drives a powerful outflow , which is very well collimated close to the star ( e.g. , free - free emission ) , but relatively highly collimated even in co. the ratio of length to width is about 1:3 at high velocities .",
    "the outflow is at high inclination , since we can see overlap between the blue- and the red - shifted lobe .",
    "if we assume the outflow to be conical , which according to the velocity position plot ( fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) appears to be a reasonable assumption , we can use the method outlined by @xcite to estimate the inclination of the outflow , and find about 65@xmath69  for both the blue and the red lobe .",
    "this is slighly higher than what @xcite find on the basis of their sio 21 map for the ne red lobe , where they derive an inclination by 4045@xmath69  from the plane of the sky .",
    "the properties of the outflow have been derived in several studies ( e.g. , @xcite , but we will redo it here ; partly because we have more accurate data , but also to point out how uncertain these estimates are .",
    "the deep integrations of @xmath3co and c@xmath82o toward i16293a ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) clearly show high velocity emission , which indicates that the @xmath61co optical depth in the wings is substantial . at near outflow velocities ( @xmath215 1.5 km  s@xmath10  from the cloud systemic velocity ) we find optical depths of 40 or more , both from @xmath3co and c@xmath82o , but note that here the line wings originate from both outflows and also get a significant contribution from the underlying accretion disk .",
    "we therefore obtained additional @xmath61co and @xmath3co spectra at the peak positions in the lobes of the ne  sw outflow , i.e. , at offset positions ( + 80,+55 ) for the redshifted lobe and ( @xmath1130,@xmath140 ) for the blueshifted lobe .",
    "these show that the red - shifted outflow has substantially higher optical depth .",
    "we estimate a @xmath61co 21 optical depth of about unity at radial velocities as high as 11 km  s@xmath10  away from the systemic velocity of the cloud , whereas the optical depth has dropped to unity at + 6 km  s@xmath10  away from the cloud core for gas in the blue - shifted outflow .",
    "the @xmath3co spectra are not sensitive enough to enable us to derive optical depths of less than about unity .",
    "we compute the outflow mass , momentum , momentum flux , and energy content with and without opacity corrections , by assuming that we can apply the same opacity correction to all of the gas in the outflow .",
    "since we have not directly measured the excitation temperature of the outflowing gas we assume it to be 50  k , but note that it could be as high as 80  k @xcite . the values in table [ t4 ]",
    "are obtained assuming an abundance ratio 10@xmath22 for [ co]/[h@xmath4 ] and summing over the map in 1 km  s@xmath10  wide velocity intervals starting 1 km  s@xmath10  from the cloud systemic velocity ( assumed to be 4 km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the apparent dynamic outflow time scales are about the same for both lobes , ( 3.03.5)@xmath216 yr .",
    "this agrees with the dynamical timescale of ( 57)@xmath216 yr derived by @xcite for the ne red lobe .",
    "however , the blue outflow lobe appears more energetic .",
    "normally when one sees an imbalance in the momentum or force of the outflow , it is an indication that one of the outflow lobes has penetrated the cloud surface and therefore has no gas to interact with .",
    "here we see no evidence for this .",
    "a more likely explanation is that we have not properly corrected for the opacity and excitation differences in the two outflow lobes .",
    "the blue lobe is more extended and has higher apparent velocities , suggesting that the gas surrounding the blue lobe is less dense than the gas surrounding the red outflow lobe .",
    "this is also seen in our opacity estimates , which are higher for the red - shifted outflow .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by @xcite and @xcite on basis of sio and ch@xmath38oh maps , respectively .      the symmetry axis of the e  w outflow passes north of i16293a , but not as clearly defined as the ne  sw outflow .",
    "the red - shifted outflow lobe is much more compact than the blue - shifted lobe , and appears to bend more towards the north .",
    "however , the peak intensity of the outflowing red - shifted gas is rather well aligned with the large blue - shifted outflow lobe with an average position angle for the flow of @xmath217@xmath69 .",
    "the e  w outflow appears to intersect with the continuum disk about 510  north of i16293a .",
    "since there is no source near this position other than i16293b , we associate the e  w outflow with i16293b .",
    "a similar conclusion was also drawn by @xcite , although they stress that at present there is no evidence for outflow activity in the immediate vicinity of b. @xcite find that the ch@xmath38oh wing emission has a narrow and nearly constant velocity width along the e  w lobes , which they attribute to turbulent entrainment .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that the e  w outflow is a fossilized flow .",
    "it has been suggested that the ne red outflow lobe and the eastern blue outflow lobe could be part of a wide angle flow similar to the l  723 outflow @xcite or that the two outflows are part of a precessing or episodic outflow driven by the same star @xcite .",
    "however , our co map clearly shows that these are two separate outflows . since the symmetry axis of the e ",
    "w outflow does not intersect with i16293a , it is rather unlikely that this outflow would have been caused by an earlier outflow episode from i16293a . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also conclude that two independent bipolar outflows are present on the basis of their sio and ch@xmath38oh maps . @xcite",
    "also discuss a third outflow , because in their low spatial resolution nagoya map , the e  w outflow extends more than 10  from iras  16293@xmath12422 and their high resolution nobeyama map does not show this extended outflow component .",
    "our map does not extend as far as the nagoya map , and our spatial resolution is poorer than that of the nobeyama co 10 map .",
    "however , the co map we present here has the advantage of being fully sampled , unlike the sio 21 emission mapped by @xcite , and it has a much higher resolution ( 20@xmath37 ) than the large - scale sio 21 map of @xcite ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "we therefore better resolve the two outflows .",
    "one can clearly see that the outflow continues to the east outside the area we have mapped , but with rather low velocities .",
    "therefore the extended blue low - velocity outflow appears simply a continuation of the e  w flow .",
    "we also clearly see the interaction of this outflow with the i16293e core , which was already found by @xcite . in our channel maps , which are overlayed on the 800-continuum emission ( fig .",
    "[ f12 ] ) , this interaction is clearly visible .",
    "it appears rather gentle : the outflow is enhanced at low velocities and seems to stream around the core and forms almost a cavity immediately behind it . that it streams around the core region",
    "is supported by the fact that we see faint red - shifted @xmath61co towards the dense core region , but the red - shifted emission is much stronger in front of the core , although one can still see it faintly on the backside as well ( fig .",
    "[ f12 ] ) .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows a blow - up of the 450 @xmath0 m image of i16293e .",
    "it is clear that the outflow has compressed the core and caused the high density n  s ridge that we see in our continuum maps and prominently at near cloud velocities in the channel - maps of fig .",
    "[ f12 ] . behind the core it appears that the outflow gets recollimated .",
    "there is no indication of interaction between i16293e and the red - shifted ne outflow lobe from our co channel maps , nor from the sio channel maps @xcite .",
    "@xcite attribute the blue and red stream of the e  w outflow around the i16293e core to the red and blue lobe of an outflow powered by i16293e causing two shocked regions ( he1 and e1 in their nomenclature ) visible in their h@xmath4co maps .",
    "they support their hypothesis by means of hco@xmath2 10 spectra taken along a slice which goes through i16293e as well as through the peaks in the h@xmath4co emission , since these spectra reveal a blue wing at one side of i16293e and a red wing on the counter side . although these wings are real , the results are different when put in context of the entire cloud .",
    "our large maps show what small maps , which do not fully cover the complete interaction region of the extended outflows with the ldn  1689n cloud , can not : local small scale flows in the vicinity of i16293e are part of large scale motions . from our co map",
    "it is clear that the apparent sw  ne outflow and the alignment with i16293e are due to projection effects of pieces of the e  w outflow from i16293b which streams around the dense prestellar core i16293e .",
    "this view is supported by the study of @xcite who find that the e  w flow has fan - shaped lobes , each of which containing blue- and red - shifted components .",
    "this would imply that e1 is red - shifted gas in the far side of the eastern blue lobe .",
    "the red - shifted shocked region e1 is thus the interaction region of the e  w outflow , while the blue - shifted h@xmath4co peaks he1 and he2 from @xcite are the interaction of the near side of the e  w blue lobe with dense gas of ldn  1689n located at the southwest and southeast side of the dense core i16293e .",
    "these interaction regions could also be the edges of i16293e .",
    "section [ envelope ] found that the envelope model of i16293a can reproduce the line profiles of most observed molecular transitions , but not of co 65 and 76 , hdo , and h@xmath4o .",
    "although the absorption at the cloud systemic velocity can be fit with an envelope model , the broad emission can not be reproduced even for sound speeds as high as @xmath173 km  s@xmath10 . here",
    "we investigate the origin of the broad high-@xmath15 co , hdo , and h@xmath4o wings by means of an outflow model .",
    "we have scaled our co 76 emission to the level of the h@xmath4o emission ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] ) .",
    "it is striking that the two spectra have such a similar shape despite the fact that the beam sizes differ by a factor of about 30 .",
    "the match of the absorption widths is also very good , and indicates that we may see here the same region with jcmt and swas in absorption .",
    "in addition , the line wings are similar , although at the blue side there is an extra co emission component while at the red side there is an extra h@xmath4o emission component present .",
    "but the extent of the wings is similar for both species .",
    "does this mean that the wings are from a very small region covered by both beams , or that the wing component is rather uniformly distributed throughout the cloud ?",
    "the swas data were fitted with a monte carlo radiative transfer code and a physical model of a spherically symmetric cloud subdivided into shells of constant physical conditions .",
    "the use of the code and its application to water lines is described in @xcite , which also analyzes the variety of water line profiles and establishes broad diagnostics of outflow , infall , and turbulence apparent in swas data .",
    "the line shape lead us to explore models which combine outflow and turbulence ; we find that the line strengths depend on the velocity field as well as on the temperature and abundance in a complex relation .",
    "figure [ f10 ] ( middle panel ) shows the predicted ortho - h@xmath4o spectra from the outflow model with an ortho - h@xmath4o abundance of @xmath219 throughout , a turbulent velocity of 2.3 km  s@xmath10 , and maximum outflow velocity @xmath220 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the temperature ranges from 200 k to 15.5 k. the outflow model provides an acceptable fit to the observed extended wing emission , but can not explain the central part of the observed profile .",
    "the outflow model results are complementary to the infall modeling of the ortho - h@xmath4o line ( fig .",

    "[ f10 ] ( bottom pannel ) the sum of the outflow and envelope spectra of ortho - h@xmath4o which indeed yields a rather good description of the entire swas spectrum .",
    "note that the red wing of the h@xmath4o emission is not fitted by our model , this may be due to multiple outflows (  [ nesw ] and  [ ew ] ) which we did not model . for a quantitative comparison we do not only need a mutiple ouflow model but",
    "also have to incorporate the outflow and infall models in one single excitation model since they overlap in extent and velocity space .",
    "this could mean that part of the blue infall gets absorbed by the blue outflow component and vice versa .",
    "an avenue for further study would be a combined infall and outflow model .",
    "the same outflow models were used to model the co 65 and 76 lines in the jcmt beam using an abundance [ co]/[h@xmath4]=@xmath200 ( fig .",

    "the wing emission predicted by the outflow model poorly fits the observed emission which indicates the presence of multiple outflows , analogous to the h@xmath4o situation .    finally , we calculated the hdo emission in the outflow in a @xmath221 beam .",
    "we started with a uniform [ hdo]/[h@xmath4 ] abundance of @xmath222 , similar to the envelope value .",
    "this yields a spectrum which matches the maximum intensity of the observed emission , but not the wings ( fig .",
    "[ f15 ] ) .",
    "this may be due to the presence of multiple outflows , similar to the h@xmath4o case .",
    "the outer wings can be fitted for an abundance of @xmath16 and results in a self - reversed profile , but its peak intensity is too high by a factor of 24 .",
    "this is not surprising since we do not include an infalling envelope",
    ". a better fit may be obtained by a combined ( multiple ) outflow and infall model as discussed above for h@xmath4o .",
    "we conclude that our shock model can explain the wings of the observed hdo emission and that the hdo abundance in the outflow may be somewhere in the range from @xmath190 to @xmath223 .",
    "it is clear that great caution should be taken when comparing the h@xmath4o abundance derived from the swas measurements and the hdo abundance derived from the jcmt observations .",
    "nevertheless we are able to use the same models since we convolve the emerging emission with the appropriate beam . because of the large beamsize , swas is not sensitive to the h@xmath4o emission from the warm inner envelope . to test this we enhanced the abundance of h@xmath4o for @xmath224 90 k to the value of @xmath200",
    "this was not found to have any significant impact on the emission in the swas beam .",

    "single dish observations have insufficient resolution to show any contribution from i16293b at all , even though we know from vla and 3  mm aperture synthesis studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the spectral index of i16293b is much steeper than that of i16293a and indicative of dust emission .",
    "what is i16293b ?",
    "based on the scarce evidence that we have , i16293b looks like a young t  tauri star , which has driven an extremely powerful large outflow which extends @xmath286 pc on the blue - shifted side . such outflows from low - luminosity young stars are not uncommon ; they are seen both as large scale optical jets @xcite and large scale co outflows @xcite .",
    "i16293b is a low - luminosity star , @xmath287 l@xmath107 , associated with compact dust emission ; the true luminosity may be found by means of high resolution millimeter - wave observations .",
    "we derive a bolometric luminosity @xmath288 l@xmath107  for the prestellar core i16293e , and find that its fir continuum spectrum resembles that of the class  0 source i16293a ( fig .",
    "@xcite quote a dust temperature @xmath289 k for this source , higher than our value of @xmath290 k since we correct for the overlapping envelope of i16293a at the position of i16293e .",
    "this correction is important since both cores are connected with a bridge - like structure ( figs .",
    "[ f1 ] , [ f5 ] ) .",
    "the temperature and density structure of i16293e resembles the conditions in the outer envelope of i16293a .",
    "it is very interesting that the hdo abundance of the warm envelope of the yso , and the core of i16293e are similar .",
    "this suggests that some of the gas species in the warm envelope may still have the abundance that they had in the prestellar stage , the difference being that the gas in the warm envelope is excited and thus easier to detect .",
    "a comparison between i16293e and i16293a could therefore be very important to understand the formation of a first hydrostatic core , a so - called class  @xmath1i protostar @xcite .",
    "such protostars lie between the prestellar clouds and the class  0 protostars , and occur when a collapsing cloud first becomes optically thick , heats up and reaches a quasi continuum stage .",
    "this stage is short lived , about @xmath291 yrs , after which a second collapse takes place and the final protostar is formed .",
    "class  @xmath1i protostars are characterized by a central core of about 200  k , embedded in a cold core of about 10  k , although the models of @xcite mostly reached a central source with a much lower temperature of 20  k.    is a first protostar present in i16293e ?",
    "most of the observed molecular line profiles from i16293e show two peaks with a stronger redshifted peak , characteristic of expansion motions . in  [ ew ]",
    "we argue that this may be due to projection effects of pieces of the e  w ouflow from i16293b which streams around i16293e .",
    "we also do not find an outflow associated with i16293e in our co maps (  [ ew ] ) , so it should be younger than a class  0 object .",
    "a central class  @xmath1i protostar with @xmath292200 k may be present but very hard to detect in deep mid- or far infrared continuum imaging since the spectral signature will be only a weak shoulder at the wien side of the energy spectrum of the core .",
    "such a first protostar will be very compact and have little mass , @xmath293 , which can easily be hidden in the dense cold i16293e core .",
    "detection with scuba seems impossible because of the beam size and because the outer envelope of such a cold core will be warmer due to the interstellar radiation field and will dominate the continuum emission . our hdo emission , which we think comes from the heart of the core , has a narrow linewidth ( @xmath294 km  s@xmath10 ) and our models yield a kinetic temperature of about 16  k. this indicates that a first protostar must still be rather cold at the low end of the temperature interval of @xcite .",
    "sensitive high resolution submillimeter interferometry of the continuum with , e.g. , the atacama large millimeter array may reveal a cold accretion disk .",
    "we think that ldn  1689n is a remarkable low - mass star - forming region , but not because it ` harbors a young protostar , two molecular outflows and a cold nearby molecular core ' @xcite .",
    "multiple outflows are common around ysos and have been reported , e.g. , in l1448 @xcite , hh  24 @xcite , and ngc  1333 @xcite .",
    "deep studies of embedded ysos in low - mass cores revealed the presence of apparently starless cold companion cores with masses of about a few @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "strong deuteration is expected in cold dense prestellar cores which are on the verge of forming a first hydrostatic core because of the extreme depletion of molecules like co which may result in an abundace ratio [ h@xmath4d@xmath2]/[h@xmath46]@xmath295 and a boost of the [ d]/[h ] ratio in molecules (  [ s : intro ] ) .",
    "indeed , several prestellar clouds have now been found to have a large depletion of co ( e.g. , l1544 , @xcite ; l68 , @xcite ) and a large h@xmath4d@xmath2 abundance @xcite .",
    "but , what really is remarkable in ldn  1689n is that it can be considered as a ` deuteration candle ' with the strongest deuteration known so - far in low - mass ysos .",
    "what causes the extreme deuteration in the envelope of i16923a and the core of i16293e ?",
    "the answer may lie in the fact that i16293ab is a binary system where the ysos and their outflows differ in age .",
    "i16293b is probably the oldest of the two ysos and the source of the fossilized e ",
    "w outflow (  [ ew ] ) .",
    "this outflow is responsible for the dynamical interaction of a part of the eastern blue lobe with a dense dark core , the precursor of i16293e .",
    "this interaction caused a shock with velocity @xmath29610 km  s@xmath10 @xcite as measured at the deuterium peak d north of i16293e and possibly higher at the first place of impact west of the core .",
    "this could have released deuterated species which were condensed on the dust grains , and compressed the gas , which then cools efficiently to low temperature @xcite .",
    "since the e  w outflow causes a less energetic shock than the ne  sw outflow @xcite and sio emission is found only associated with the ne  sw outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we expect only deuterated species to desorb since these were frozen out relatively late and thus are located near the outer surface of the grain mantles .",
    "these slow shocks of the outflow leave the grains mostly intact , with a post shock composition like that of a grain in a @xmath292 k gas .",
    "the release of deuterated species , combined with the gas - phase deuterium chemistry at low temperatures , boosts the deuterium enrichment to extremely high values just after the passage of a shock ; these deuterated species freeze out again in about @xmath297 yrs .",
    "compression from this shock resulted in an elongated n ",
    "s structure , visible in the 450 @xmath0 m image ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . at the north side",
    "this filamentary structure bends to the northeast where the gentle flow passes around the core ; here the deuterium peak is located .",
    "this shock would cause a blue - shift of the systemic velocity in i16293e with respect to the parental ldn  1689n cloud .",
    "indeed , the hdo spectrum toward i16293e is blue - shifted by about 0.3 km s@xmath10 with respect to the systemic velocity of the ldn  1689n envelope toward i16293a ( table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite also found such a blue - shift of deuterated molecules toward the deuterium peak d which is located about 10 arcsec northwest of the continuum peak of i16293e .",
    "we believe that at this position the shock has the greatest chemical impact .",
    "this strong deuterated core may have been shocked again at a later time by the ne  sw outflow from i16293a causing a velocity red shift of 0.3 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "however , only the non - deuterated species , which predominently reside in the outer core region , are red - shifted with respect to their deuterated forms found mainly in the heart of the core .",
    "this is exactly the velocity shift which @xcite would expect from an interaction of the northeast red lobe .",
    "however , they did not detect this , since they measured only the h@xmath3co@xmath2 10 line at the position of i16293e which has a velocity equal to the cloud systemic velocity . under our hypothesis",
    "this has to be measured with respect to the reference frame of the first shock .",
    "this second shock boosted the gas - phase deuterium chemistry to its maximum and the temperature is further lowered due to further compression .",
    "we think that it is this firecracker effect which leads to the extreme deuteration of ldn  1689n in general , and i16293e in particular .",
    "multiple shocks may be common in low - mass ysos ; @xcite suggest that serpens smm1 is influenced by multiple low - velocity shocks driven by the outflow .",
    "we have analyzed our submillimeter dust and continuum data in terms of an excitatiom analysis using a model for the temperature and density structure of the disk , envelope , and outflow of i16293a , b , and e. the spectral lines of h@xmath4o , hdo , and h@xmath4d@xmath2 were subsequently compared with predictions from a simple chemical network .",
    "figure [ f17 ] shows a schematic overview of the iras 16293 - 2422 region showing its distinct physical regions ( disk , warm dense core , warm envelope , cold envelope , outflow regions , etc . ) . for each region",
    "we indicate the derived physical parameters , and their molecular abundances . for the submillimeter disk of i16293a",
    "we derive a dust temperture @xmath298 k , a source size of about 800 au , a total mass of 1.8m@xmath107  and a luminosity of 16.5 l@xmath107  which corresponds to a gas density @xmath108 @xmath30 .",
    "the envelope of i16293a can be well described by a collapsing envelope model with parameters age @xmath170@xmath299 yr and sound speed @xmath155 km s@xmath10 .",
    "in fact the center of the expansion wave , @xmath300 , is 8903700  au from the centre which corresponds to 623@xmath37 at the distance of 160 pc , comparable to the beam size of the scuba continuum and submillimeter line emission of the species we used in the analysis .",
    "the outer radius of the envelope is about 7300 au and the temparature ranges from 115 k in the inner region to 12 k in the outer region .",
    "the envelope mass is @xmath301 m@xmath107 .",
    "we find that for a yso such as i16293a the line emission is beter suited than the continuum emission to constrain the infall parameters .",
    "the excitation analysis of the envelope yields a constant hdo abundance of @xmath190 throuhout the envelope , and an ortho - h@xmath4o abundance of @xmath18 for the regions with @xmath261 k , while the abundance is lowered by a factor of 150 in the colder regions . from the c@xmath131o analysis we find that co",
    "is depleted by a facot of 50 for the envelope regions where @xmath302 k. the line wings of the co , hdo , and h@xmath4o emission can qualitatively be explained by a single outflow model with a turbulent velocity of 2.3 km  s@xmath10 and where the maximum outflow velocity is about 6 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the excitation analysis of the outflow model indicates that the ortho - h@xmath4o abundance in the outflow is about @xmath303 and that the hdo abundance in the outflow is in the range of @xmath223 to @xmath172 .",
    "a more quantitative comparison requires a multiple outflow model .",
    "we find that only two outflows are present , a ne  sw outflow with a dynamical time scale of about @xmath304@xmath305 yr which is powered by i16293a a class  0 source , and an e  w outflow which is a fossil flow with a dynamical time scale of @xmath306@xmath307 yr driven by i16293b which looks like a young low - luminosity t  tauri star .",
    "the prestellar object i16293e is well described with an isothermal core of @xmath308 k , a core radius of 8000 au and a power law density structure of the form @xmath110 where @xmath309 au@xmath310 @xmath30 .",
    "the total mass mass of this core is @xmath122 m@xmath107 .",
    "our excitation analysis of the core indicate a depletion of co and hco@xmath2 by a factor of ten relative to the ` standard abundances ' and that the dco@xmath2 abundance is larger than that of h@xmath3co@xmath2 .",
    "our tentative detection of hdo indicates the presence of a cold condensation in the heart of this core where the hdo abundance is about @xmath311 .",
    "our detailed co mapping shows that i16293e has no outflow , so its evolutionary stage is younger than class  0 .",
    "we argue that this core may hide a first hydrostatic core , a so called class  @xmath1i object which is deeply embedded in a largely unaffected cold core .",
    "the reason for the extreme deuteration in the l16293n cloud and in particular in i16293a , and i16293e may lie in the fact that i16293ab is a binary system where the ysos and the outflows differ in age causing a firecracker efffect of the deuteration . in this scenario the older e  w ouflow from i16293b is responsible for the formation of i16293e out of a dense dark core through a slow shock where only deuterated species were desorbed from the grains which , in combination with the low temperatures , amplifies the deuterium enrichment in the gas phase before a possible re - absorption on grains .",
    "this strong deuterated core may have been shocked again an a later time by the younger nw  sw outflow from i16293a further boosting the gas - phase deuterium chemistry to extreme values .",
    "it is remarkable that the abundances of many molecules in the prestellar core i16293e and in the warm part of the envelope of i16293a are comparable",
    ". in particular , the hdo abundances are similar which indicates that the warm gas in i16293a may have gone through the same cold pre - collapse phase that i16293e is currently in .",
    "a simple chemical gas - phase modeling of the deuterium chemistry requires that co is depleted by a facor of 50 for @xmath312 k in order to reproduce the observed h@xmath4d@xmath2 emission from our chemical network applied to the envelope @xmath313 structure , and that an h@xmath4o abundance of @xmath314 for @xmath261 k and @xmath315 for @xmath17 k is required to reproduce the observed spectrum from the chemical model . the [ hdo]/[h@xmath4o ] abundance in the warm inner - envelope of i16293a ( @xmath316 ) is close to the value that has been measured in the solar system and supports this .",
    "our chemical modeling indicates that the [ hdo]/[h@xmath4o ] ratio is determined in the cold gas phase prior to star formation , and that this ratio is conserved in the early stages of low - mass star through freeze out on dust grains formation and that the molecules are released unprocessed to the gas phase after the formation of a low - mass yso . if this warm deuterated gas is subsequently locked - up in a proto - planetary disk before the high temperature gas chemistry causes a de - deuteration , the [ d]/[h ] ratio of hdo in low - mass pre - solar systems would remain conserved . to investigate this scenario in detail ,",
    "sensitive follow - up observations of the hdo and h@xmath4o ground - state transitions in a large sample of low - mass ysos are needed at high spatial and spectral resolution ( i.e. , interferometry from high altitudes [ hdo ] and from space [ h@xmath4o ] ) and allow a study of the [ hdo]/[h@xmath4o ] abundance evolution from prestellar cores to planets .",
    "the h@xmath317o ground - state transition may be more suitable than the ortho - h@xmath4o transition since the ground - state of the latter molecule is at @xmath318 k above ground , while that of h@xmath317o is at 0  k , and the main isotopic form of water is expected to be mostly optically thick in its ortho and para ground - state lines .",

    "<S> the density in the envelope of i16293e is fit by a radial power law with index @xmath14 , a mass of 4.4  m@xmath13 , and a constant temperature of 16  k. these respective models are used to study the chemistry of the envelopes of these pre- and protostellar objects .    </S>",
    "<S> we made a large , fully sampled co @xmath15=21 map of ldn  1689n which clearly shows the two outflows from i16293a and b , and the interaction of one of the flows with i16293e . </S>",

    "<S> the hdo abundance is constant at a few @xmath21 throughout the envelopes of i16293a and e. because the derived h@xmath4o and hdo abundances in the two objects can be understood through shock chemistry in the outflow and ion - molecule chemistry in the envelopes , we argue that both objects are related in chemical evolution . </S>",
