    "we consider the cauchy problem for a nonlinear wave equation in one space dimension u_tt - c(u)(c(u ) u_x)_x  =  0,with initial data u(0,x )  =  u_0(x),u_t(0,x )  =  u_1(x).the function @xmath0 , determining the wave speeds , is assumed to be smooth and uniformly positive .",
    "as long as the solution remains smooth , it is well known that its energy ( t )   12 dxremains constant .",
    "it is thus natural to seek global solutions within the set of functions having bounded energy , i.e.  with @xmath1 and @xmath2 at a.e .",
    "time @xmath3 . in this functional space ,",
    "the existence of globally defined weak solutions was first proved in @xcite . for smooth initial data , formation of singularities",
    "was studied in @xcite .",
    "a different approach was introduced in @xcite , relying on a transformation of both independent and dependent variables . in the new variables , the equation ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "is replaced by a semilinear system , which always admits global smooth solutions ( for smooth initial data ) .",
    "going back to the original variables , this method yields a family of solutions to the original equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) , continuously depending on the initial data ( in appropriate norms ) .",
    "we recall here the main properties of these global solutions , defined both forward and backward in time : v    the solution @xmath4 takes values in @xmath5 for every @xmath6 . in the @xmath3-@xmath7 plane ,",
    "the function @xmath8 is hlder continuous with exponent @xmath9 .",
    "the map @xmath4 is continuously differentiable as a map with values in @xmath10 , for all @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , it is lipschitz continuous w.r.t .  the @xmath12 distance , i.e. u(t,)-u(s,)_^2   l|t - s|for some constant @xmath13 and all @xmath14 .",
    "the equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is satisfied in integral sense : dxdt  =  0 for all test functions @xmath15 , continuously differentiable with compact support in the @xmath3-@xmath7 plane .",
    "concerning the initial conditions at @xmath16 , the first equality in ( [ 1.2 ] ) is satisfied pointwise , while the second holds in @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "he solutions constructed in @xcite are * dissipative * , with energy @xmath19 which is nonincreasing . on the other hand ,",
    "the solutions obtained in @xcite are * conservative * in the sense that the energy @xmath20 equals a fixed constant for almost all times @xmath3 . at an exceptional set of times of measure zero ,",
    "one can still define a conserved energy in terms of a positive radon measure",
    ". however , this will not be absolutely continuous w.r.t .",
    "lebesgue measure ( for example , it may contain dirac masses ) .",
    "at these particular times , the integral in ( [ 1.3 ] ) accounts only for the absolutely continuous part of the energy , and is thus strictly smaller than @xmath21 .    by putting the equation into a semilinear form",
    ", this variable change provides a transparent way to understand singularity formation , and construct a semigroup of conservative solutions continuously depending on the initial data .",
    "a natural question , which motivated the present paper , is whether the same variable transformation can be used to generate a semigroup of dissipative solutions .",
    "we recall that , in connection with the camassa - holm equation , semigroups of conservative and dissipative solutions have been constructed respectively in @xcite and @xcite , based on a similar approach .    to implement such a program , the main difficulty can be explained as follows . using characteristic variables ,",
    "one obtains a semilinear system whose right hand side is lipschitz continuous in the case of conservative solutions , but discontinuous in the case dissipative solutions . because of these discontinuities",
    ", the existence of solutions does not follow from general theory and must be studied with care .",
    "a guiding principle is that , if all discontinuities are crossed transversally , then the cauchy problem is still well posed .",
    "this is indeed what happens for the camassa - holm equation @xcite .",
    "however , in connection with ( [ 1.1 ] ) we now encounter a  borderline \" situation , illustrated by the system with discontinuous right hand side @xmath22 as @xmath23 approaches the discontinuity we have @xmath24 , and hence @xmath25 .",
    "this is strictly positive , except when @xmath26 .",
    "this lack of transversality renders the system much harder to study .",
    "our analysis shows that , assuming @xmath27 for all @xmath28 , global dissipative solutions of ( [ 1.1 ] ) can indeed be constructed by solving a semilinear system with discontinuous right hand side .",
    "however , in contrast with @xcite , solutions are not obtained as the unique fixed points of a contractive transformation .",
    "instead , the existence proof relies here on a compactness argument , based on the kolmogorov - riesz theorem @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it does not guarantee the uniqueness of solutions .",
    "we speculate that the issue of uniqueness might be resolved by the analysis of characteristics , as in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the variable transformation introduced in @xcite and describe the new semilinear system with discontinuous right hand side , which corresponds to dissipative solutions . at the end of this section",
    "we can state our main results , on the global existence of solutions to the semilinear system and to the original wave equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "section  3 is the core of the paper .",
    "the discontinuous semilinear system is here approximated by a family of lipschitz continuous systems , admitting unique solutions .",
    "as the approximation parameter @xmath29 , a compactness argument yields a subsequence strongly converging to an exact solution . in section  4 , returning to the original variables @xmath30 , we obtain the global existence of a weak solution to the nonlinear wave equation ( [ 1.1])-([1.2 ] ) , forward in time .",
    "the proof that this solution satisfies all properties ( p ) is very similar to the one in @xcite , and we thus omit most of the details . v",
    "we briefly review the variable transformations introduced in [ bz ] .",
    "these reduce the quasilinear wave equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) to a semilinear system , in characteristic variables . throughout this section ,",
    "all equations are derived assuming that the solution is smooth . at a later stage",
    "we will prove that the same equations remain meaningful and provide a solution to the original equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) also for general initial data @xmath31 . define \\",

    "we can thus regard @xmath32 as the densities of backward and forward moving waves , respectively . multiplying the first equation in ( 2.3 ) by @xmath33 and the second one by @xmath34 , we obtain two balance laws for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , namely \\ { ( r^2)_t - ( cr^2)_x & =   c2c(r^2s - rs^2 ) , ( s^2)_t + ( cs^2)_x & =   - c2c(r^2s -rs^2 ) .",
    ".as a consequence , for a smooth solution @xmath8 the following quantities are conserved : e(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)=r^2+s^24,m - u_tu_x = s^2-r^24c.indeed \\ { e_t+(c^2m)_x&=  0,m_t+e_x&=  0 .. one can think of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the energy densities associated with backward and forward moving waves , respectively . because of the sources on the right hand sides of ( [ 2.4 ] ) , some energy is transferred from forward to backward waves , or viceversa .",
    "however , the total amount of energy remains constant . to deal with possibly unbounded values of @xmath39 , it is convenient to introduce a new set of dependent variables : w2r , z2s , so that @xmath40 from ( [ 2.3 ] ) one derives the equations \\ { w_t - cw_x&=  ( r_t - cr_x )  =  c2cr^2-s^21+r^2,z_t+cz_x&=  ( s_t+cs_x )  =  c2cs^2-r^21+s^2 . .    to reduce the system to a semilinear one , we perform a further change of independent variables .",
