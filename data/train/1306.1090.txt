    "many astrophysical systems in equilibrium are virialized .",
    "examples range from objects that are in hydrostatic equilibrium , such as stars , planets , and intergalactic medium , to dynamical systems such as planetary systems , binary stars , stellar globular clusters , and galaxies . for such systems ,",
    "the mass inside a sphere of a radius @xmath1 and a characteristic velocity @xmath2 are related through the well known equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a factor that depends on the geometry and dynamics , and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "for example , in the case of keplerian rotation , @xmath6 because the gravity and centrifugal forces are equated , while in the case of supersonic accretion , @xmath7 because the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy are equated .",
    "for such simple cases , @xmath4 does not change when it is integrated over some volume , even if weighted by a non - uniform density . if the system is more complicated , the density - weighted , volume - integrated @xmath4 could be dominated by the denser part of the flow .",
    "it is often assumed that the broad line regions ( blrs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are also virialized .",
    "this assumption can not be directly verified because the blrs are spatially unresolved .",
    "however , the very compactness of the blrs and the broadness of the observed lines suggest that the dynamics of the blr gas is strongly coupled to the gravity of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) . therefore , the assumption of virialization has been used to determine the smbh mass @xmath8 , provided both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are known . in the case of agn ,",
    "practically all the mass is concentrated in the center with @xmath8 being much greater than that of stars and gas , therefore @xmath9 .",
    "the emission line width , @xmath10 , can be measured relatively easily and used as an estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "using reverberation mapping , the distance @xmath1 can be estimated via @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the time delay for blrs to respond to changes in the continuum ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this method has been used in many agn surveys for multiple emission lines with different characteristic emission radii , and it has been improved over the years ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the blrs are virialized based on the correlation between the time delay and line width ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the basic assumptions behind the above mentioned method are very plausible , the method has its limitations .",
    "for example , different blr structures , the radiation pressure , viewing angle , gravity due to the host galaxy , and different methods for characterizing the broad - line widths are all expected to affect the measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . due to these systematic effects",
    ", the value of @xmath4 may be uncertain by two orders of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations have estimated the average values in the range of @xmath13@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "observational estimates of the value of @xmath4 may differ from the theoretical ones . in some cases",
    ", the value of @xmath4 used by observers is composed of a correction factor which depends on the definition of the line width , and a theoretical factor which assumes some geometry and dynamics .",
    "another issue with this method is that the relation @xmath15 , which comes from the virial assumption ( eq .  [ eq : mbh ] ) , can hold not only in virialized systems , but also in several types of winds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "winds have been proposed as one of the possible scenarios for the blr in agns , and have been studied extensively both observationally and theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a closely related question is how observations of a certain emission line can tell us whether the system is virialized or not .",
    "@xcite showed that a number of different emission - line features are consistent with a two - component disk@xmath16wind model of the blr ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that , while the most widely used h@xmath17 line is virialized , the second most used civ line has a non - virialized component ( but see @xcite for recent contradicting results ) .",
    "this may suggest that virialization can be limited to only some parts of the blrs .",
    "these considerations motivate us to check whether the outflows could be virialized and if so to what extent . in this paper , we analyze four simulations of different _ disk wind _ models , and examine which parts of the winds are virialized . in ",

    "these simulations are chosen from the earlier works by proga and his collaborators to provide controlled environments , representing different aspects of winds driven from a keplerian accretion disk .",
    "we chose these four particular simulations in order to explore disk winds with different physics not because they are necessarily the best to model the blrs .",
    "in fact , only the last simulation has been performed with parameters suitable for quasars and captures the minimum required physics .",
    "however , the first three simulations are relevant in the context of this paper because they can be rescaled to agn ( see below for scaling relationships ) . in addition , as we show , they are useful to understand and highlight the properties of the wind in the fourth simulation and asses its generality . specifically , the first two simulations illustrate that not all disk winds appear to be virialized and emphasizes that the size of the acceleration zone is the key to wind virialization .",

    "an isothermal , steady state , wind model  b from @xcite .",
    "this model is one of several tests computed by @xcite . in this , perhaps simplest , disk wind models , the gas expands and accelerates because it is implicitly heated ( gains energy ) in accordance with the assumption of being isothermal .",
    "the calculations and results are presented in units where @xmath18 and the sound speed @xmath19 ( i.e. , distance is in units of @xmath20 ) .",
    "as found by @xcite , the geometry of such winds depends on the density profile along the equator : flat profiles yield vertical winds whereas the profiles where the density decreases strongly with radius yield spherical winds ( see also @xcite for more details ) . here",
    ", we present the results for the density profile @xmath21 that produces a nearly spherically symmetric wind .",
    "the ratio between the maximum velocity at the end of the computational domain and the keplerian velocity at @xmath22 ( in the simulation units ) is @xmath23 for this model .",
    "this ratio is an indicator of the wind acceleration and virialization : lower values indicate weak acceleration ( the gravity is dominant ) whereas high values suggest very strong acceleration resulting in an unvirialized outflow .",
    "a value of more than 3 , as in model 1 , indicates an unvirialized outflow .",
    "this is confirmed by our more detailed analysis summarized below in  [ sec : results ] .    a thermal wind model from an x - ray heated disk , which is similar to the model c8 of @xcite , but with an outer radius 5 times greater .",
    "the bh mass in this model is @xmath24 , and the total luminosity is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the eddington luminosity ( therefore the wind can not be driven by radiation pressure ) .",

    "the density profile is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the inverse - compton ( ic ) radius .",

    "we note that the units for the model 1 and 2 are related to each other by @xmath31 . as model  1",
    "is a simplest example of a thermally driven disk wind , model  2 can be viewed as a more physical variate of model  1 because in model  2 the physics of gas heating and cooling is explicitly included .",
    "one of the consequences of this more physical model is that here the wind solution does not depend on the density profile as long as the density is high and the gas temperature is low .",
    "this model includes radiation heating and cooling , as applied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the local x - ray flux is corrected for optical depth effects , taking only electron - scattering as the source of opacity .",
    "this model produces a fast - moving ( few@xmath32 ) high - density wind with convex streamlines close to the poles and slower ( few@xmath33 ) concave streamlines close to the equator .",

    "model thermal driving is negligible , the driving is not due to gain of thermal energy but due to transfer of momentum from radiation to the gas .",
    "as such , compared to model  1 and 2 , model  3 represents a physically different class of winds .",
    "the model assumes a disk around a @xmath35 white dwarf ( wd ) of radius @xmath36 with an isothermal equation of state .",
    "we show this particular model because it quite well accounts for observations of disk winds in cataclysmic variables ( see fig . 2 in * ?",

    ", the @xmath34 ratio is 1.99 .",
    "rescaling results from model  3 to agn is not straightforward , in part because it does not include some of the physical processes that are essential in agn , e.g. , the x - ray ionization .",
    "therefore , our last model is an extension model  3 that was computed specifically for agn .    a line - driven wind with x - ray heating and cooling ( @xcite ) .",

    "the model computes the radiation force due to lines using the intensity of the radiation integrated over the uv - band only .",

    "the gas density along the disk midplane was assumed to scale as @xmath47 . for small radii at the disk atmosphere and wind base , the model predicts a typical density @xmath48 which results in a relatively low photo - ionization parameter ( @xmath49 ) despite the strong radiation coming from the center .",
    "in addition , the model predicts significant self - shielding : dense clumps form close to the center ( `` failed wind '' ) as a result of the over - ionization , which provide shielding for the gas launched at large radii .",

    "we emphasize that the ultimate indication for a flow to be virialized is that @xmath81 has a flat radial profile , because these components ( density - weighted , volume - integrated internal energy , kinetic energy and gravitational potential ) are the quantities that enter the virial theorem .",
    "figure  [ fig : i6r ] presents the results of model 1 ( the isothermal wind ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : i6r]a shows that the radial component dominates over the rotational component everywhere except for near the equator .",
    "the right panel shows that @xmath63 is a function of @xmath1 , but a very weak function of @xmath88 .",
    "it is evident that at @xmath89 the flow is highly non virialized for every @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ fig : i6r]b shows that the radial component of @xmath90 becomes dominant at @xmath91 , independent of the value of @xmath92 .",
    "this transition radius is expected , because the density becomes close to spherically symmetric at greater radii , and thus the integration does not affect the value of @xmath90 ( eq .

    "we find that the kinetic properties of the flow do not scale with the gravitational potential , independent of the density weighting and viewing angle .",

    "the right panel of figure  [ fig:151dw28]a shows that @xmath63 is a strong function of @xmath1 and @xmath88 .",
    "therefore it is not straightforward to draw conclusions about the virialization of the flow using this information alone , though the large volume with blue and purple colors ( @xmath96 ) hints that this is not a virialized flow .",

    "the rotational component originates from the keplerian disk , and it makes the flow virialized .",
    "one can say that the wind `` remembers '' its attachment to the central object up to that radius . we conclude that the wind in model  2 would be observed as non - virialized , because it is virialized only in the inner regions .",

    "if the wind is launched from a virialized system such as a keplerian disk , the wind can appear as virialized to a distance greater than @xmath140 times the launching radius ( figure  [ fig : keplerian_velocity_decrease ] ) .",
    "therefore , our results support the assumption that the blrs are virialized up to a large radius .",
    "the assumption that the blrs are virialized is commonly used to determine the mass of smbhs .",
    "while it is widely assumed that accreting gas is virialized , winds are often considered to be non - virialized as the non - gravitational forces break their connection to the central smbh . in the present work ,",
    "we analyze simulations of winds for four different cases , and show that the flow in the line - driven disk wind `` remembers '' its origin  a keplerian disk  for a relatively long distance , and as such , can be considered to be virialized .",
    "we also performed the same analysis for accretion / inflow simulations for all the models in @xcite and @xcite , covering a large range of parameter space ( eddington ratio , density , temperature , x - ray fraction and more ) , including models where thermal instability created dense cool clumps ( cf .",

    "generally , all inflows were found to be virialized because they are supersonic .",
    "as these results are similar to the above four simulations , we do not show them here .",
    "we find that if the emission lines are generated close to the center , they would be observed as virialized up to a large radius . for a typical agn with a smbh of @xmath110 ,",
    "the flow would be virialized up to @xmath141 , where blrs would be included .",
    "the projected quantities ( the left panel of figures  [ fig : i6r]c , [ fig:151dw28]c , [ fig : cv_e2]c and [ fig : kp04]c ) show that @xmath86 dominates over @xmath85 even at small inclination angles , up to @xmath142 ( for higher @xmath87 @xmath85 becomes dominant ) .",
    "the implication of this is that the observed projected value of @xmath81 will scale as @xmath143 for @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath112 and @xmath4 relate to each other by density weighting and integration over volume , this implies that @xmath144 .",
    "the average factor @xmath145 discussed in the literature ranges from @xmath146 ( @xcite ) , and raging up to @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "our equation  ( [ eq : fancyf_p ] ) is consistent with the result of @xcite , who derived @xmath148 , assuming a thin ring in keplerian rotation .",
    "the dependency of @xmath149 is indeed expected , as the flow in our simulations can be thought of as a collection of rings in keplerian rotation .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath150 by @xcite comes from relating the rotational velocity to the line velocity dispersion , while our numerical factor @xmath151 comes from density weighting and integration .",
    "therefore we regard the numerical consistency as coincidental .",
    "we shall return to this point in a future paper where synthetic line profiles will be computed .",
    "we note that other studies give different results for @xmath152 .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested @xmath153 , where the parameters @xmath154 and @xmath155 quantify the importance of the disk and isotropic components of the blr , respectively . for a thin disk @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then @xmath158 .",
    "theoretically , the uncertainty in the value of @xmath4 is the source of error in the determination of smbh masses .",
    "however , the theoretical value of @xmath4 is not necessarily identical to the @xmath4-factor that is used in observational estimates .",
    "the latter depends on the particular way the line width is measured ( e.g. , whether fwhm or @xmath159 is used to determine the width , or how the line - width is determined for a profile with multiple peaks ) .",
    "furthermore , the blr radius obtained by reverberation mapping is a weighted average , estimated from the cross - correlation lag between the changes of continuum and line response . in other words , the line width and the lag",
    "do not necessarily correspond to the same physical location ( i.e. , the line width does not necessarily give us the circular velocity at the radius obtained from the cross - correlation lag ) .",
    "we expect that there would be a simple relation between the theoretical value of @xmath4 and the observed one , however , estimating this relationship accurately is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we find that the line - driven disk wind models discussed here ( models 3 and 4 ) are virialized to a relatively large extent , although certainly there are classes of outflows that are not virialized ( such as the parker wind and models 1 and 2 ) .",
    "our results support the notion that the blr can be virialized even if it contains an outflow , provided that the outflow s structure is similar to that of a dense , slowly accelerating line - driven wind from a keplerian disk .",
    "this , in turn , gives additional support for a two component model ( disk+line - driven disk wind ) of the blr in general and not just for the outflows in particular ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* who arrived at a similar conclusion by considering only the disk and the wind base not the whole wind ) .",
    "clearly it is necessary to continue to test this model .",
    "our conclusions here motivate calculations of the reverberation response of a disk wind even if it is complex and time - dependent as in model 4 .",
