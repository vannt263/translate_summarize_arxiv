    "phenomenological approaches to dm searches have focused mainly on the galactic center ( gc ) that has been observed by the egret satellite in the energy range 100 mev - 10 gev @xcite and , more recently , by the ground - based @xmath2erenkov telescopes whipple @xcite , cangaroo - ii @xcite and hess @xcite with an energy threshold of hundreds of gev .",

    "current observations such as the rotation curves in the central galactic regions @xcite , planetary nebulae kinematics @xcite , microlensing events toward the galactic bulge @xcite and spectroscopic gravitational lensing @xcite do not allow yet to discriminate among the various scenarios , although they seem to favor a very shallow , or cored density profile .",

    "the distance from the center of the overdensity at which the folding occurs has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath67 for a galaxy like the milky way .    the following period of continuous cross - infalls lasts until inhomogeneities diffuse the process and prevent the formation of structures . in this period , a set of caustic surfaces which wrap around the galaxy is formed where the phase space folds .",
    "these surfaces define areas of enhanced density located at the boundary between regions characterized by different numbers of flows of particles .",
    "namely , in the internal region of the caustic surface there is an odd number @xmath68 of streams of particles compared to the @xmath69 flows in the external region .",
    "the non - zero velocity dispersion prevents the mass density to diverge at the caustics surface .",
    "more precisely , the density at the caustics is smeared off on distances @xmath70 , corresponding to about @xmath71 pc for a tev - mass neutralino .",

    "however , ground - based observatories located in the northern hemisphere could only observe the gc at a large zenith angle , hence introducing large observational errors .",
    "for @xmath110erenkov telescopes located in the southern hemisphere , such as hess and cangaroo , as well as for satellite - borne detectors , the gc represents by far the brightest source of the @xmath0-ray sky and will therefore give the best chance to detect a possible signature of neutralino annihilation . much more sensitive detectors will be needed to investigate the nature of the dm sources responsible for such signal .",

    "<S> in the frame of indirect dark matter searches we investigate the flux of high - energy @xmath0-ray photons produced by annihilation of dark matter in caustics within our galaxy under the hypothesis that the bulk of dark matter is composed of the lightest supersymmetric particles . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the detection of the caustics annihilation signal with currently available instruments is rather challenging . indeed , with realistic assumptions concerning particle physics and cosmology </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath1-ray signal from caustics is below the detection threshold of both @xmath2erenkov telescopes and satellite - borne experiments . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we find that this signal is more prominent than that expected if annihilation only occurs in the smoothed galactic halo , with the possible exception of a @xmath3 circle around the galactic center if the mass density profile of our galaxy exhibits a sharp cusp there . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the angular distribution of this @xmath0-ray flux changes significantly if dm annihilation preferentially occurs within virialized sub - halos populating our galaxy rather than in caustics . </S>"
