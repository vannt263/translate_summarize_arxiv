    "this allows normal modes of ring structures be computed in a much smaller amount of time , using a much smaller amount of memory , thus making it possible to extend the normal mode computations to larger ring structures .",

    "indeed , for symmetric ring structures , it is likely that only symmetric or anti - symmetric ( symmetricity=-1 ) are functionally important .",
    "for example , a previous study on p97  @xcite indicated that only symmetric modes contribute to the conformation changes that also are symmetric .      for symmetric ring structures with @xmath0 subunits ,",
    "it is evident that @xmath70 of the modes are symmetric .",

    "it is helpful to realize that both symmetric and anti - symmetric of an @xmath0-subunit structure are symmetric modes of the same structure if structure is considered as an @xmath74-dimer that has @xmath74-fold axial symmetry .",

    "as we will see later , for ring structures that are not completely symmetric , symmetricity is partially broken due to degeneracy  @xcite and the number of modes with perfect symmetry ( i.e. , symmetricity=1 ) is reduced and their fraction is less than @xmath70 and consequently they no longer form a closed subspace . however",

    "of all the symmetric modes of the perfect structure , only a small percentage of them are able to preserve their symmetricity .",
    "the next question is , what are these modes that are able to preserve their perfect symmetricity of 1 and why ?",
    "what happens to the other symmetric modes ?",
    "figure  [ fig : degeneracy ] shows the frequency distribution of the modes that are able to preserve their perfect symmetricity of 1 .",
    "most of these modes fall into either the low frequency end ( low mode indices ) or the high frequency end ( high mode indices ) .    to find out why the modes at either the low frequency end or the high frequency end can preserve their symmetricity and what happens to the other symmetric modes , we plot in figure  [ fig : overlap ] , for the 2,167 symmetric modes of the perfect structure , the symmetricity of their besting matching modes in the actual structure and the overlaps between them and their best matching modes .",
    "not surprisingly , a strong correlation is found : the modes that are mostly preserved ( or unchanged ) under structure variation , as indicted by a large overlap , also preserve most of their symmetricity .",
    "thus , to the question raised earlier , `` why are the modes at the low or high frequency end able to preserve their symmetricity ? '' the answer is that these modes are robust to small structural changes and remain mostly unchanged ( with a large overlap ) .",
    "this is thus consistent with our previous finding that modes at the low or high frequency end are less degenerate  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the low overlaps of the other modes indict that they have deformed greatly under the structure deviation .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlap ] shows that non - degenerate modes are the ones that can maintain their symmetricity , while degenerate modes generally can not .",
    "it is perceivable that for some systems symmetric modes are critical to the realization of functions .",
    "the ability to preserve their symmetricity is consequently important .",
    "practically speaking , most ring structures deposited in pdb do not have exact symmetry .",
    "the coordinates of the atoms in each subunit may be slightly off from their otherwise perfectly symmetric locations .",
    "moreover , we do not expect symmetric ring structures such as p97 to maintain a mathematically exact symmetry while they function in cell .",
    "for such structure models that have nearly exact symmetry , how do we obtain symmetric modes efficiently ?",
    "apparently , we can not apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0 ] ) or ( [ eq : anti ] ) if the structure is not exactly symmetric .    one possible solution is to choose not to take advantage of the symmetry and compute the normal modes using the whole structure .",
    "the drawback is that this can become computationally too costly , especially for large systems .",
    "another possible solution is to reconstruct a perfectly symmetric structure from one of the subunits by applying axial symmetric rotations and then apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0 ] ) to compute modes .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that the modes computed by the reconstructed structure ( which has a perfect symmetry ) are generally somewhat different from those computed with the original ( pdb ) structure",
    ". such difference reflects the degeneracy of protein normal modes  @xcite .",
    "a more ideal solution is to be able to obtain symmetric modes that are robust to the structure differences among the subunits .",
    "is there an efficient way to obtain the subset of symmetric modes that are robust to structure variations without solving the hessian matrix of the whole multi - mer ? to answer this question , it is helpful to realize that the subunits are highly similar to one another in structure and they only deviate slightly from the otherwise perfectly symmetric structure . in our previous work , we have shown that some normal modes , especially those at low frequency end , are robust to small structure deviations while others are not and become degenerate  @xcite .",
    "for these non - degenerate modes , the slight deviation from the perfect symmetry does not disturb them .",
    "for this reason , we determine symmetric modes that are robust to small structure deviations in the following way .",
    "first , we use each subunit in turn as the center and use eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0 ] ) compute the symmetric modes .",
    "we then find the symmetric modes that are common to all subunits ( modes are considered common or the same if the overlaps between them are greater than 0.99 ) .",
    "these modes are robust to structure differences among the subunits .    figure  [ fig : common ] shows the index / frequency distribution of the symmetric modes that are common to all subunits .",
    "the modes computed from each subunit are compared with the 2,167 symmetric modes of a perfectly symmetric structure of p97 : 5ftl - perfect .",
    "modes that are common to all subunits are then shown in figure  [ fig : common ] as a histogram .",
    "the figure shows that the modes that are common to all subunits consist mostly of the modes at the low frequency end , representing domain motions , or modes at the high frequency end , representing localized motions .",
    "the distribution in figure  [ fig : common ] is similar to that in figure  [ fig : degeneracy ] , which is computed using the whole structure . indeed , of the first 50 lowest frequency symmetric modes of the actual structure , which are more likely to be functionally important than the other modes , 47 are included among the symmetric modes common to all subunits as identified above .",
    "there is also a drawback with this last approach .",
    "the set of symmetric modes that are common to all subunits are not exactly the same as the set of symmetric modes computed from the whole complex , as indicted above .",
    "however , it is probable that both sets capture all the symmetric modes that are functionally important and thus their small difference is not a problem .",
    "when this is in doubt , one may also compute the modes from the whole complex ( given that it is computationally feasible ) and compare the two sets of modes closely .      to test that these symmetric modes maintain the key functional motion of the protein",
    ", we compute the overlap between these modes ,    to show that these modes maintain most low frequency symmetric modes .",

    "it is likely that most aaa+ proteins  @xcite that employ a threading mechanism may use symmetric motions along the central pore as their primary function motions .",
    "a deeper understanding of the motion patterns of their symmetric modes may help us better understand , for example , how protein unfolding and degradation are carried out .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible that some molecular systems , though having symmetric structures , may not utilize symmetric motions as their primary functional movements .",

    "we find that scarcely any symmetric modes are left ( data not shown ) when structure deviation is greater than 0.1    for p97 .",
    "this means that if symmetric motions are critical to a complex s function , then maintaining the symmetry in structure ( i.e. , not having a significant deviation from it ) not only makes the structure look appealing but also is important to preserving its key motion patterns and thus its functions as well .",

    "<S> this work suggests a deeper reason for the existence of symmetric complexes : that they may be formed not only for structural purpose , but likely also for a dynamical reason , that certain symmetry is needed by a given complex to obtain certain symmetric motions that are functionally critical .    may ask hyuntae to do this in a follow - up study    the difference in sbnma the extent of broken symmetry is more severe in high freqeuncy modes ( run sbnma using symmetric structure : need to make sure hydrogen atoms are protonated for one unit only , then apply rotation to get the other units </S>",
