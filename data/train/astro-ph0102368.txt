    "light rays are deflected as they travel through the universe , and as a result our view of the distant , faint galaxies is somewhat distorted . measuring these lensing induced distortions has proven to be a valuable tool in observational cosmology ( see the review by mellier 1999 ) : the lensing signal is sensitive to the projected mass surface density of the deflector , and through lensing one can probe the mass distribution without having to rely on assumptions about the dynamical state and nature of the deflecting matter .",
    "when the surface density of the lens is sufficiently high , the distortions can be so large that multiple images can be seen , which provide strong constraints on the mass distribution in cluster cores . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the weak lensing regime , which allows us to study the cluster mass distribution on larger scales .",
    "weak lensing is a powerful tool to probe the distribution of matter in the universe on various scales .",
    "one exciting application is the measurement of the lensing signal induced by large scale structure ( e.g. blandford et al .",
    "1991 ; kaiser 1992 ; bernardeau , van waerbeke , & mellier 1997 ; schneider et al .",
    "1998 , swjk hereafter ) , and recently several groups have reported detections of this signal ( bacon et al .",
    "2000 ; kaiser , wilson , & luppino 2000 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 ; wittman et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the first successful weak lensing results were obtained by studying the systematic distortion of the images of faint galaxies behind rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g. tyson , wenk , & valdes 1990 ) .",
    "measuring the masses and mass - to - light ratios of rich clusters is an important application of weak lensing , because comparison of the weak lensing result with other mass estimators ( e.g. , x - ray , s - z effect , or velocities ) can give important clues about the geometry and dynamical state of the system ( e.g , zaroubi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "weak lensing also has some drawbacks .",
    "first of all , the amplitude of the lensing signal depends on the redshift distribution of the faint background galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are generally too faint to be included in spectroscopic redshift surveys , but photometric redshifts are thought to provide ample information on the redshift distribution of these galaxies ( e.g. , hoekstra , franx , & kuijken 2000 ) .",
    "also the observed weak lensing signal is a measure of a surface density contrast , and one of the problems associated with this is the mass sheet degeneracy ( gorenstein , shapiro , & falco 1988 ) .",
    "one could try to get around this problem by measuring the lensing signal out to large distances from the centre , and arguing that the cluster surface density should vanish there .",
    "another potential problem is the fact that the lensing signal is sensitive to all matter along the line of sight . in general ,",
    "weak lensing analyses of clusters assume that the signal induced by the cluster under investigation is so dominant that the contribution from other structures along the line of sight can be neglected .",
    "the effect of structures , close to the cluster , such as the filaments that connect the cluster to the ` cosmic web ' , or an elongation along the line of sight , have been studied through n - body simulations ( e.g , cen 1997 , metzler et al .",
    "local structures introduce both a bias and an additional uncertainty in the cluster mass estimate , in particular when one for instance tries to measure the mass within @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we study how distant structures affect weak lensing mass estimates of clusters of galaxies .",
    "unlike the local structure , these are uncorrelated with the cluster , and they can be filaments , galaxy groups , or even other clusters . that such structures affect the mass estimates is easily seen in the case of a massive high redshift cluster , with a low redshift group in front of it . assume the cluster is at a redshift of unity , with a group at say @xmath7 , and that the mass of the group is one tenth of that of the cluster : the contribution of the group to the total lensing signal is about one third , compared to the 10% in mass .    in this paper",
    "we will quantify the uncertainty in weak lensing mass estimates of rich clusters caused by intervening matter .",
    "to do so we examine the predicted statistical properties of the contribution by large scale structure .",
    "we use an approach similar to what is done to predict the amplitude of the cosmic shear signal , which is used to constrain the cosmological parameters . given a cosmological model , we estimate the uncertainty in cluster masses derived from weak lensing analyses .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss two popular methods to measure cluster masses . in section  3",
    "we derive the equations that describe the effect of large scale structure on such mass estimates .",
    "the effect of large scale structure on mass estimates for clusters is quantified in section  4 .",
    "we examine the dependence on cluster redshift , aperture size and source redshift distribution .",
    "cluster masses can be measured in several ways . in this paper",
    "we will use aperture mass statistics , which provide a filtered measurement of the of the surface mass density in an aperture ( schneider 1996 , s96 hereafter ) :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the weight or filter function .",
    "provided that @xmath9 is compensated , i.e.    @xmath10    the aperture statistic can be related to the tangential shear @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately @xmath11 can not be observed directly , but one can measure the distortion @xmath12 . in the weak lensing regime , where @xmath13 , one can use @xmath14 , which is what we do throughout this paper .",
    "then we have    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 is related to @xmath9 through :    @xmath17    s96 has shown that the signal - to - noise ratio of the aperture mass measurement is optimal when @xmath18 is the same as the ( expected ) tangential shear as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "we want to quantify the uncertainty in mass measurements of clusters , and therefore require that the aperture statistic has a clear physical meaning .",
    "studies of cosmic shear ( see swjk ) use different choices for @xmath18 .",
    "below we discuss two statistics that have been used to estimate cluster masses .",
    "a popular model to describe the cluster mass distribution is the singular isothermal sphere ( sis )    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the einstein radius .",
    "the einstein radius ( in radians ) is related to the velocity dispersion through    @xmath22    the tangential shear as a function of radius is simply given by    @xmath23    the best fit sis model is obtained by minimizing    @xmath24    with respect to @xmath21 , where @xmath25 are the individual measurements of the lensing signal at radius @xmath26 . the uncertainty in the measurement of the tangential shear ,",
    "@xmath27 is given by    @xmath28    with @xmath29 the uncertainty in the measurement of an individual galaxy , @xmath30 the number density of sources , and @xmath31 the width of the @xmath32th radial bin .",
    "if we take the widths of all the bins the same , and assume that the number density of sources is uniform , minimizing with respect to @xmath21 gives    @xmath33    for a continuous profile the summation can be replaced by an integral . as mentioned before one measures the distortion and not the shear , and equation  [ eqre ] only works well when @xmath34 is small . also substructure in",
    "the cluster core changes the average tangential distortion ( e.g. , hoekstra et al . 2000 ) . to come around these problems",
    "one has to choose an inner radius for the fit , such that equation  [ eqre ] is a good approximation .",
    "if we assume that the tangential shear has been measured from a distance @xmath35 out to @xmath36 , the einstein radius satisfies    @xmath37    comparison with equation  [ eqmapq ] shows that the best fit sis model is an aperture mass measurement where @xmath18 is given by    @xmath38    the corresponding weight function for the surface density @xmath9 is given by    @xmath39    the mass profiles of many clusters that have been studied to date are consistent with a sis model .",
    "thus the weight function suggested above is close to the optimal choice .",
    "however , this choice for @xmath40 is not a continuous function .",
    "a functional form which is continuous , yet similar is suggested by s96 , who discusses the use of aperture mass statistics to find mass concentrations in deep images .",
    "another statistic which has been widely used is the @xmath41-statistic ( fahlman et al .",
    "1994 ) :    @xmath42    it gives the difference of the average dimensionless surface mass density in a circular aperture of radius @xmath43 and that in an annulus with @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding weight function @xmath40 is given by :    @xmath45    this gives    @xmath46    thus the @xmath41-statistic can be related to the tangential shear through :    @xmath47    the sis model fit has only a simple physical meaning when the cluster mass profile is indeed isothermal .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath41-statistic is independent of the mass distribution , although the statistic is not optimal in terms of signal - to - noise ratio .    under the assumption that one can estimate or minimize @xmath48 , the average surface density in the control annulus , one obtains a measurement of @xmath49 , and thus of the cluster mass .",
    "one way to do so is to assume a model for the cluster surface mass density which is used to estimate the average surface density in the annulus ( e.g. hoekstra et al .",
    "1998 ) . this way",
    "the cluster mass estimate is less dependent on the assumed model compared to the sis model fit .",
    "under the assumption that the cluster is the only lensing structure in the field , the aperture mass @xmath50 provides a direct measure of the cluster mass .",
    "however , the weak lensing signal is sensitive to all matter along the line of sight , and other structures , which we will refer to as large scale structure , will introduce an additional signal :    @xmath51    the aperture mass statistic measures a density contrast , and the expectation value for the contribution by uncorrelated large scale structure @xmath52 ( see also swjk ) .",
    "thus on average , distant structures do not introduce a bias in cluster mass estimates , but an uncertainty in the cluster mass of . as a result",
    "the effect of distant large scale structure can be treated as an additional ( statistical ) source of error .",
    "its relative importance can be decreased by averaging the results for several clusters , i.e. measuring their average mass .",
    "we note that on certain scales @xmath53 might be distributed skewly .",
    "the effect of ` local ' ( or correlated ) large scale structure has been studied using n - body simulations ( e.g. , cen 1997 ; metzler et al . 1999 ) . in this case",
    "either projection effects , or filaments connected to the cluster bias the weak lensing mass estimates towards somewhat higher values .",
    "this becomes particularly important when one tries to estimate the enclosed mass within several mpc s from the cluster centre ( cen 1997 ) .",
    "swjk have shown how one can relate the aperture mass statistic to the power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "measuring  for a number of random fields allows one to constrain the projected power spectrum . in this paper",
    "the problem is reversed : given the power spectrum , what is the resulting ?",
    "a detailed discussion about the use of aperture mass statistics and cosmic shear can be found in swjk and bartelmann & schneider ( 1999 ) .",
    "swjk showed that the effect of large scale structure on the variance in the aperture mass statistic is given by :    @xmath54    where the effective projected power spectrum @xmath55 is given by :    @xmath56    here @xmath57 is the radial coordinate , @xmath58 the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath59 the comoving angular diameter distance .",
    "@xmath60 is the source averaged ratio of angular diameter distances @xmath61 for a redshift distribution of sources @xmath62 :    @xmath63    the function @xmath64 in equation  [ eqmap ] depends on the filter function @xmath40 , and is given by :    @xmath65    as has been demonstrated in jain & seljak ( 1997 ) and swjk it is crucial to use the non - linear power spectrum in equation  20 .",
    "this power spectrum can be derived from the linearly evolved cosmological power spectrum following the prescriptions of hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "the form of the function @xmath66 , which probes the projected power spectrum , depends on the choice of @xmath40 . for the sis model fit we take @xmath67 , which yields    @xmath68.\\ ] ] @xmath69    we will use a typical value for @xmath70 ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "larger values are used when much substructure is found in the cluster core ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "the resulting @xmath71 is presented in figure  [ filter]a .    for the @xmath41-statistic",
    "we find    @xmath72    where we have taken the inner radius @xmath73 .",
    "a typical value for @xmath74 used in weak lensing mass estimates of clusters is @xmath75 , i.e. , the control annulus runs from the boundary of the region in which we want to determine the mass out to 1.5 times this radius . throughout this paper",
    "we will use this value for @xmath74 . in figure",
    "[ filter]b the filter function @xmath76 is shown ( taking @xmath77 ) .      the projected power spectrum @xmath78 depends on the redshift distribution of the sources , and consequently we need to know , or assume , a redshift distribution for the sources .",
    "we will use the photometric redshift distributions inferred from the northern and southern hubble deep fields ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta , yahil 1999 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 ) , which generally work well ( e.g. , hoekstra , franx , & kuijken 2000 ) .",
    "there is , however , some field to field variation in the redshift distribution the sources , but we assume that the distributions obtained from the hdfs are representative for the whole sky .",
    "we note that most of the lensing by large scale structure is caused by structures at intermediate redshifts , and as a result the signal induced by the lss is fairly robust against variations in the source redshift distribution .    using the colours of the galaxies in the hdfs",
    "we have computed their @xmath36 magnitudes , which allows a direct comparison with ground based observations .",
    "we use galaxies fainter than @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting photometric redshift distributions for different limiting magnitudes are presented in figure  [ zdist ] .",
    ".parameters of the cosmological models considered here .",
    "all three models are cluster normalized.[cosmotab ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      given the photometric redshift distribution discussed above we calculate the contribution of the lss to the measurements of @xmath21 and the @xmath41-statistic as a function of aperture size . we have considered three different cosmologies , which are listed in table  [ cosmotab ] .",
    "figure  [ mapscale]a shows the scatter in the value of the einstein radius @xmath21 as a function of aperture size for the scdm ( thick lines ) and the ocdm ( thin lines ) models . for clarity ,",
    "we limit the number of curves shown in figure  [ mapscale ] and omit the results for the @xmath80cdm model . for this model",
    "the scatter is similar to the ocdm model , with a somewhat higher amplitude on large scales and a somewhat lower amplitude on arcminute scales .",
    "the scatter in the value of @xmath21 increases for larger aperture sizes .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is independent of aperture size , and as a result the relative contribution of large scale structure to the error budget increases with increasing aperture size . also the scatter is larger for fainter limiting magnitudes , i.e. higher source redshifts .    figure  [ mapscale]b shows the scatter for the @xmath41-statistic . because both @xmath81 and @xmath82 decrease with increasing aperture size the interpretation of figure  [ mapscale]b is not as straightforward as is the case for figure  [ mapscale]a .",
    "the effect of aperture size on the accuracy of weak lensing mass estimates is discussed in detail in section  4.3 .",
    "comparison of the results for the scdm and ocdm cosmologies indicates that the differences are fairly small .",
    "we found that the @xmath80cdm cosmology gives similar estimates .",
    "although we consider these different cosmologies throughout the paper ( and plot the results for the ocdm and scdm models ) we note that the results hardly depend on the assumed cosmology .",
    "we examine the uncertainty in the weak lensing mass estimate caused by uncorrelated large scale structure .",
    "the results are derived for a cluster with a sis mass profile , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath1 km / s , typical for rich clusters that have been studied in the past .",
    "we study the dependence on cluster redshift , where we discuss the results for low redshift clusters in more detail .",
    "we also examine how the accuracy of the mass measurements depends on aperture size .",
    "first we examine how the mass estimates for clusters at different redshifts are affected when the lensing signal is measured out to a radius of @xmath2 mpc .    for the sis model",
    "we use the measurements in an annulus from 0.225 to @xmath2  mpc ( @xmath83 mpc , @xmath70 ) . in the case of the @xmath84statistic",
    "we use an inner radius of @xmath85 mpc and an outer radius of @xmath86 mpc @xmath87 .",
    "the value of the @xmath41-statistic only provides a lower limit to the cluster mass , and one way to circumvent this is to estimate the average surface density in the annulus around the aperture , for instance by using the results from a model fit .",
    "however , this model fit is also affected by large scale structure . in general the region where the model is fitted to the data",
    "largely coincides with the annulus used to compute the value of the @xmath41-statistic . thus if the value of the @xmath41-statistic is increased by additional structures",
    ", the mass from the model will also be higher .",
    "although the uncertainty in the model parameters and the @xmath41-statistic are not completely correlated , we will assume they are .",
    "this gives a fair upper limit on the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath88    @xmath89    the results are presented in figure  [ ratio ] .",
    "panels  c and  f show respectively the value of the einstein radius and @xmath88 as a function of cluster redshift .",
    "we show the results for the scdm ( thick lines ) and the ocdm ( thin lines ) cosmologies .",
    "the solid lines are for a limiting magnitude of @xmath90 and the dashed lines for @xmath91 . panels  b and  e",
    "show the scatter in the aperture mass statistics introduced by the large scale structure .",
    "finally the ratios of the scatter and the lensing signal are presented in figure  a and  d.    for clusters at low redshifts @xmath92 the relative importance of large scale structure for the @xmath80cdm model is similar to that of the scdm model . for clusters at high redshift , or deep observations , the results for the @xmath80cdm are close to the ocdm results .",
    "comparison of figures  [ ratio]a and  d shows that the relative importance of the distant large scale structure is smaller in the case of the sis model fit . for this mass estimator",
    "the uncertainty in the cluster mass estimate is about 6% for rich clusters at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass is large for high redshift clusters when the limiting magnitude of the sources is rather bright ( solid lines ) .",
    "however , in practice , to detect a significant lensing signal of a high redshift cluster deep observations are needed to ensure a sufficiently high number density of sources . as a result",
    "the importance of large scale structure is minimized ( dashed lines ) . in the case of nearby clusters ,",
    "the presence of structure along the line of sight results in a relatively large uncertainty in the cluster mass ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "the uncertainty introduced by large scale structure is much larger when the @xmath41-statistic is used .",
    "this is not surprising as one only uses the shear measurements at relatively large radii , where the cluster mass surface density has become fairly low .",
    "in addition to this annulus , the sis model fit uses data at much smaller radii , where the cluster signal is much higher .    the noise in weak lensing analyses is generally dominated by the intrinsic shapes of the source galaxies , and not by the noise in the large scale structure .",
    "both sources of error depend differently on the limiting magnitude of the background galaxies , and as a result the total noise is a rather complex function of cluster redshift and limiting magnitude , as is demonstrated in figure  [ contsn]a for the ocdm cosmology .    figure  [ contsn]b shows the the signal - to - noise ratio for a sis model fit to the tangential shear of a cluster of @xmath1 km / s , when the contribution of large scale structure is ignored .",
    "it should be noted here that we assume that the shapes of the sources have been measured accurately . in reality",
    "the shapes of very faint galaxies are difficult to determine . from figure  [ contsn]b",
    "one would expect to be able to measure accurate masses for low redshift clusters .",
    "however , the results change significantly when we include the contribution from large scale structure as is shown in figure  [ contsn]a .",
    "the change in signal - to - noise ratio is small for high redshift clusters , where the shapes are still the major contributor to the noise .",
    "the true signal - to - noise ratio is lowered significantly in the case of deep observation of clusters at intermediate redshifts , but the largest difference is seen for clusters at low redshifts .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios for the @xmath80cdm model are intermediate to those found for the ocdm and scdm models , resembling the ocdm better for high redshift clusters .",
    "however , at high redshifts the differences between the various models become less important ( they are fairly small anyway ) , because the noise is dominated by the intrinsic shapes of the sources .",
    "figure  [ contsn]a demonstrates that large scale structure introduces a large uncertainty in the mass measurement of low redshift clusters . to date",
    "not many low redshift clusters have been studied through weak lensing .",
    "this is because the amplitude of the lensing signal peaks at intermediate redshifts , and the signal is extremely small for nearby clusters .",
    "furthermore their angular sizes were too large for the ccd cameras .",
    "panoramic ccd cameras have become available recently , and a number of low redshift clusters have been imaged for weak lensing purposes .",
    "for instance joffre et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have analysed the mass distribution of abell 3667 @xmath93 .",
    "although the lensing signal of low redshift clusters is small , there are several reasons to study these systems .",
    "first of all , they can , or have been studied extensively by other techniques . also , the uncertainty in the redshift distribution of the sources is almost non - existent , and one can use relatively large background galaxies .    in this section",
    "we examine how the weak lensing mass measurement of the coma cluster @xmath94 is affected by structures at higher redshifts",
    ". a weak lensing analysis of the most nearby rich cluster of galaxies is challenging , but could provide important insights in the cluster dynamics .",
    "we assume a velocity dispersion of 1000  km / s for the cluster ( e.g. , colles & dunn 1996 ) .    in figure  [ noise_sis]a we plot the sources of noise in the measurement of the einstein radius as a function of limiting magnitude of the sources .",
    "the figure shows the contribution from the large scale structure ( dashed lines ) and the intrinsic shapes of the sources ( dotted lines ) .",
    "for the intrinsic shapes of the sources we have assumed @xmath95 , similar to what is observed in deep hst images ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "2000 ) reaching the depth of the hdfs one would expect to obtain a signal - to - noise ratio of more than 20 .",
    "figure  [ noise_sis]a demonstrates that the total uncertainty in the measurement of the einstein radius reaches a minimum value for a limiting @xmath90 .    figure  [ noise_sis]b shows the expected signal - to - noise ratio as a function of limiting magnitude , and it demonstrates that observations with @xmath96 no longer improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the mass measurement .",
    "the maximum signal - to - noise ratio that can be reached by fitting a sis model to the observed tangential shear around the coma cluster is @xmath97 for the scdm model , and @xmath5 for the ocdm model .",
    "the results for the @xmath80cdm model lie between the curves for the other two models .    in figure  [ noise_zeta ]",
    "we show how the accuracy of the mass measurement is affected by large scale structure when the @xmath41-statistic is used .",
    "comparison with figure  [ noise_sis ] shows that the sis model fit yields a better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the intrinsic shapes of the sources result in a statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the einstein radius .",
    "if the sis model is fitted to the measurements in an annulus from @xmath35 out to @xmath36 , the error in @xmath21 is given by    @xmath98    where @xmath30 is the number density of sources , and @xmath29 is the uncertainty in the measurement of the tangential distortion for a single galaxy .    from equation  [ noisere ] we find that this contribution to the error budget decreases slowly for increasing aperture sizes .",
    "however , figure  [ mapscale]a shows that the noise contribution from large scale structure increases rather rapidly with aperture size .    figure  [ noise_app_sis]a shows how the contributions of the intrinsic shapes of the sources , and the large scale structure depend on the aperture size .",
    "the results are for a cluster at a redshift @xmath99 , and the lensing signal has been measured from @xmath100 mpc out to a radius @xmath101 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath21 caused by the intrinsic shapes of the sources decreases slowly with aperture size ( dotted curve ) , whereas the contribution by the distant large scale structure increases ( dashed line ) .",
    "figure  [ noise_app_sis]b shows the resulting signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is virtually constant for outer radii larger than @xmath102 mpc .",
    "measuring the lensing signal in larger apertures does not improve the accuracy of the cluster mass .",
    "one has also to keep in mind that we have assumed that the mass profile is well described by a sis model , which might not be true in the outer parts of clusters .    for clusters at higher redshifts",
    "the curves look similar , but the maximum signal - to - noise ratio is reached at somewhat larger ( physical ) aperture sizes .",
    "the noise caused by the large scale structure dominates the error for low redshift clusters , and for these systems , the signal - to - noise ratio decreases slowly with increasing aperture size .",
    "so far we have used an inner radius for the sis model fit of @xmath100 mpc , but one can not always fit the model at such small distances from the centre .",
    "for instance in the case of the @xmath103 cluster ms  1054 - 03 hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the mass distribution in the centre is rather complex and the substructure lowers the azimuthally averaged tangential shear .",
    "consequently they fit the sis model from @xmath104 out to @xmath105 mpc , which corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "we also have examined how the accuracy of the mass estimate changes when the sis model is fitted to the data within a given aperture , while the inner radius is increased .",
    "in this situation both the noise caused by the shapes of the sources and the contribution by the large scale structure increase . thus small values for the inner radius improve the signal - to - noise of the mass measurement , but one should keep in mind that substructure in the cluster centre complicates a safe choice for the inner radius .",
    "for the @xmath41-statistic the noise contribution caused by the shapes of the galaxies is given by    @xmath107    however , we want to estimate @xmath108 , and thus we have to add the average surface density in the annulus from 1 to @xmath101 @xmath109 mpc . as before we estimate @xmath110 from a sis model fit to the tangential shear .",
    "the errors in the @xmath84statistic and the einstein radius from the model fit are combined according to equation  25 , because the errors are correlated .",
    "we note that the size of the correction depends on the assumed mass profile , but for increasing values of @xmath101 the correction becomes smaller ( i.e. , @xmath110 becomes smaller ) .",
    "the resulting noise estimates are presented in figure  [ noise_app_zeta]a .",
    "the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath108 for a cluster at a redshift @xmath99 is presented in figure  [ noise_app_zeta]b .",
    "it shows that using a larger @xmath101 improves the accuracy in the measurement of @xmath108 .",
    "a similar calculation shows that the contribution of the large scale structure becomes more important when one tries to measure the average surface density in larger apertures .",
    "for instance the uncertainty in @xmath111 almost doubles compared to @xmath108 .",
    "attempts to measure the average cluster mass profile out to large projected distances from the cluster centre will also be affected by large scale structure , given the fact that it is already difficult to measure the total mass .",
    "unfortunately it will be difficult to quantify the effect of distant large scale structure on such measurements .",
    "the observed weak lensing signal is sensitive to all matter along the line of sight , and as a result this additional matter acts as a source of uncertainty in mass estimates of clusters of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the effect of distant large scale structure , uncorrelated with the cluster mass distribution .",
    "it can be treated as an additional source of noise .",
    "given a cosmological model it is possible to compute the statistical uncertainty in the weak lensing mass measurement caused by the distant large scale structure , and quantify its contribution to the total error budget .",
    "we have considered two methods to estimate the mass from a weak lensing analysis .",
    "one way is to fit a sis model to the observed lensing signal .",
    "the other method uses the @xmath41-statistic ( e.g. , fahlman 1994 ) to estimate the mass .",
    "both methods give similar results .",
    "we find that the importance of matter along the line sight is fairly small for rich clusters ( @xmath1 km / s ) at intermediate redshifts , provided that the bulk of the sources are at high redshift compared to the cluster .",
    "if the lensing signal is measured out to @xmath2 mpc from the cluster centre , the typical @xmath112 relative uncertainty in the mass cause by the large scale structure is about @xmath4 .    in certain situations",
    "the effect of large scale structure is more important . for nearby clusters , such as the coma cluster ,",
    "background structures introduce a considerable uncertainty in the mass .",
    "considering only the noise caused by the shapes of the sources used in the weak lensing analysis one expects to achieve very accurate weak lensing mass measurements of nearby clusters , but we find that the large scale structure limits the maximum achievable signal - to - noise ratio to @xmath5 , irrespective of the depth of the observations .",
    "we also have examined how the accuracy of the weak lensing mass estimate changes when the lensing signal is measured out to large projected distances from the cluster centre . in the case of",
    "the sis model fit we find that the signal - to - noise ratio does not increase significantly when one includes measurements at radii larger than @xmath102 mpc .",
    "when the @xmath41-statistic is used to estimate the mass within a @xmath113 mpc radius aperture the signal - to - noise ratio does increase with @xmath101 .",
    "if the cluster mass profile well described by a sis model , the model fit results in a better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the effect of large scale structure is important in the outskirts of clusters , where the cluster signal itself is low . in this paper",
    "we have quantified the uncertainty in the measurement of the cluster mass , but distant large scale structure will also introduce noise in studies that try to constrain the mass profiles of clusters at large projected distances .",
    "furthermore studies of the 3-d structure of clusters by combining weak lensing , x - ray , and s - z data ( e.g. , zaroubi et al . 1998 ) will be affected by uncorrelated large scale structure .",
    "photometric redshifts of the sources can be used to decrease the effect of large scale structure , either by modeling the contribution of large scale structure to the lensing signal , or by selecting sources in an optimal redshift range .",
    "this can be only done at the expense of a large amount of additional data . because the effect of large scale structure can be treated as an additional ( statistical ) source of noise .",
    "thus an alternative procedure is to average the results of an ensemble of clusters , thus decreasing the noise on the ( average ) cluster mass estimate .",
