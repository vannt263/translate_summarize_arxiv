    "gravitational microlensing has become a new tool for discovering and characterizing populations of dark objects . by nightly monitoring of millions of stars ,",
    "several groups have detected the rare brightenings that occur when a dark object passes between a source star and the observer @xcite .",
    "these events have led to powerful statements on the dark matter content of the milky way @xcite , strong limits on the possibility of planetary mass dark matter @xcite , as well as important discoveries regarding the distribution of mass towards the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "see , or for a general review , and , and for discussion of the interpretation of eros events .",
    "all previous microlensing results were found using source stars either towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) or the galactic bulge , although microlensing searches towards m31 have also been undertaken , and possible events reported @xcite . in this paper",
    "we announce the first discovery of a microlensing candidate toward a new target galaxy , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the candidate event s light curve shows no variation for 3 years before an upward excursion lasting @xmath0 days that peaks around january 11 , 1997 at a magnification of @xmath1 .",
    "the smc gives a new line - of - sight through the milky way halo , and a new population of source stars .",
    "microlensing towards the smc is important since a comparison of the microlensing rate towards the smc with the rate towards the lmc has been predicted to be a powerful way of measuring the flattening of the milky way dark halo @xcite .",
    "most workers assume that the dark halo is spherical , but there is little observational or theoretical reason to believe this is so . a direct measurement",
    "therefore would be very valuable .",
    "in addition , new lines - of - sight allow for discrimination between various theories @xcite for the populations responsible for lmc microlensing . a dwarf galaxy or possible stellar stream between us and the lmc is unlikely to also be responsible for microlensing towards the smc .",
    "in addition , since initial microlensing results towards both the lmc and bulge were surprising , the potential for initial surprises from smc microlensing is large .",
    "the macho microlensing survey employs a dedicated telescope on mount stromlo , australia with two simultaneous red and blue passbands and a 0.5 square degree field of view . see and references therein for details of the telescope , camera , photometry , data base , and analysis systems",
    "we have published results on 22 lmc fields @xcite containing on the order of 8.5 million stars over a period of 2 years and our four - year analysis of 30 lmc fields is currently underway . for the smc",
    "we have monitored 21 fields , 6 with good temporal coverage , for a period of 4 years .",
    "these top 6 fields in the smc contain approximately 2.2 million stars .",
    "exposures of 300 seconds were taken for all lmc and early smc images , but due to crowding and distance they were subsequently increased to 600 s for the smc .",
    "approximately 2/3 of the over 4400 observations of the top 6 smc fields are 600 s. altogether , smc observations span the dates may 15 , 1993 to the present , giving an average of 730 observations per field with a mean sampling of about 2 - 3 days .    for the smc , photometry over our entire four - year data set has not yet been completed , but after running our alert software on over two years of photometry , possible microlensing candidates , as well as possible supernova and nova candidates were found .",
    "figure 1 shows the photometric lightcurve for the best microlensing candidate found by this method .",
    "the source star    in this event is located at @xmath4 = 01 h 00 min 05.7 s , @xmath5 = -72@xmath6 15 01 ",
    "( j2000 ) .",
    "a finding chart is available at http://darkstar.astro.washington.edu .",
    "the star has median magnitudes v = 17.70 , and r = 17.66 .",
    "a color magnitude diagram for the area near this star is shown in figure  2 , indicating that this is an upper main sequence star .",
    "also shown in figure 1 is a fit to the theoretical microlensing light - curve ( see ) .",
    "there are five parameters to the fit : ( 1,2 ) the baseline fluxes , ( 3 ) the maximum magnification @xmath7 , ( 4 ) the duration ( einstein ring diameter crossing time ) @xmath8 days , and ( 5 ) the time of peak magnification @xmath9 d or roughly january 11 , 1997 .",
    "the @xmath10 to the fit is 2391 with 857 degrees of freedom .",
    "a measure of the signal to noise @xcite is given by @xmath11 .",
    "however , examination of the best seeing images shows that the source star is blended with another smc star .",
    "[ an image showing the blend is available at http://darkstar.astro.washington.edu .",
    "] we performed another fit taking into account this possibility , in this case finding a best fit blend with @xmath12% of the flux in the lensed primary , giving @xmath13 , @xmath14 days , and an almost identical @xmath15 and @xmath16/dof = 2.77 . using a stack of good seeing images and an image obtained from our alert system @xcite",
    ", we performed independent photometry and find the source likely to be a blended star with 77% of the flux in the lensed primary . using image differencing techniques @xcite to subtract",
    "the primary also gives similar results .",
    "a blended fit with the blend fraction set to 77% gives @xmath17 , @xmath18 days , and again @xmath16/dof = 2.77 .",
    "the source could contain other undetected blended stars , so the above blend fractions are upper limits , implying a duration of @xmath19 days .",
    "we note that a centroid shift of a star during lensing can also give information about blending @xcite , but we did not perform this analysis in this case since we can resolve the stars in some images .    given the flat baseline , high signal to noise , the good shape , and the achromaticity we classify this as an excellent microlensing candidate .",
    "however , even taking into account the blend , the source star is more luminous than previous lmc events , and near the region of the color - magnitude diagram susceptible to contamination from  bumper \" type variable stars @xcite .",
    "apart from this , it passes the selection criteria used for lmc microlensing in , and it also passes selection criteria used for bulge events . the scatter in the lightcurve around the fit is larger than the photometry error bars imply , as the fit @xmath20dof of 2.8 indicates .",
    "this @xmath20dof is somewhat larger than for most of our lmc microlensing events @xcite , however , the smc is a new target and we have not yet characterized our photometry as we have for the lmc and bulge .",
    "the blending also causes systematic errors in the photometry .",
    "currently a more refined analysis of the data are underway , including a difference frame analysis which may greatly reduce the problems associated with blending @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the smc and lmc microlensing optical depth is very useful .",
    "almost independent of the dark matter halo model , the ratio @xmath21 gives a good measurement of the flattening of the halo @xcite .",
    "the optical depth is the probability that a given star is lensed , and can be estimated from @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total exposure in star - years , and @xmath24 is the detection efficiency for event @xmath25 @xcite . since we have not yet run our standard analysis to select microlensing events or the monte carlo needed to calculate @xmath24 , we can not yet give a good estimate of @xmath26 .",
    "for a very rough estimate for this one event alone , we can use @xmath27 stars times the roughly 850 days in this preliminary search , and use @xmath28 to @xmath29 from the lmc @xcite . then with durations quoted above",
    ", we find @xmath30 to @xmath31 , consistent with that of our reported @xcite lmc optical depth .",
    "note that this estimate will change when the search over all the smc data is completed , when proper values of @xmath23 and @xmath32 are calculated , and when proper event selection is performed .",
    "we note that the long duration of this event ( @xmath33 days ) would imply a mass of approximately @xmath34 for lenses in a standard dark halo with masses @xmath35 and @xmath36 being roughly half as likely . for a blended fit",
    "@xmath37 days , the corresponding mass would be @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is also possible that both the lens and source belong to the smc . in this case",
    ", a wide range of lens masses would be consistent with @xmath39 days and internal velocities @xmath40 km / s for the smc , depending upon the line - of - sight depth of the smc .",
    "the line - of - sight depth of the smc is relevant to the interpretation of observed microlensing events , and has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "we conclude from and that the extreme line - of - sight depth at any position in the smc is unlikely to be greater than 12 kpc and that in field 207 ( in the north - central region of the smc ) is unlikely to be greater than 6 kpc and possibly much less .",
    "thus , naively , one does not expect the optical depth from smc / smc lensing to be large enough to account for even one such event .",
    "a more complete analysis will be presented elsewhere after photometry and analysis of the smc fields have been completed .",
