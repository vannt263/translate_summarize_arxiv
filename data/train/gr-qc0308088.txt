    "the problem of initial singularity still remains at the center of modern day cosmology .",
    "though big bang theory is deep rooted among the scientists dealing with early day cosmology , it is natural to look back if one can model a universe free from initial singularity .",
    "an attempt was made by us for several years . in doing so",
    ", we studied the nonlinear spinor field in a bianchi - type i universe ( bi ) in a series of papers   @xcite .",
    "why nonlinear spinor field ?",
    "it is well - known that the nonlinear generalization of classical field theory remains one of the possible ways to over come the difficulties of the theory which considers elementary particles as mathematical points . in this approach elementary particles",
    "are modeled by regular ( soliton - like ) solutions of corresponding nonlinear equations .",
    "the gravitational field equation is nonlinear by nature and the field itself is universal and unscreenable .",
    "these properties lead to definite physical interest for the proper gravitational field to be considered .",
    "we prefer spinor field to scalar or electromagnetic ones , as the spinor field is the most sensitive to the proper gravitational one .    why anisotropic universe ?",
    "though spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models are widely considered as good approximation of the present and early stages of the universe , the large scale matter distribution in the observable universe , largely manifested in the form of discrete structures , does not exhibit homogeneity of a higher order .",
    "in contrast , the cosmic background radiation , which is significant in the microwave region , is extremely homogeneous , however , recent space investigations detect anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background . the observations from cosmic background explorers differential radiometer have detected and measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies in different angular scales .",
    "these anisotropies are supposed to hide in their fold the entire history of cosmic evolution dating back to the recombination era and are being considered as indicative of the geometry and the content of the universe .",
    "more about cosmic microwave background anisotropy is expected to be uncovered by the investigations of microwave anisotropy probe .",
    "there is widespread consensus among the cosmologists that cosmic microwave background anisotropies in small angular scales have the key to the formation of discrete structure .",
    "the theoretical arguments  @xcite and recent experimental data that support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one leads to consider the models of universe with anisotropic background .",
    "a bi universe , being the straightforward generalization of the flat frw universe , is one of the simplest models of an anisotropic universe that describes a homogeneous and spatially flat universe . unlike the frw universe , which has the same scale factor for each of the three spatial directions , a bi universe has a different scale factor in each direction , thereby introducing an anisotropy to the system .",
    "it moreover has the agreeable property that near the singularity it behaves like a kasner universe , even in the presence of matter , and consequently falls within the general analysis of the singularity given by belinskii et al .",
    "also in a universe filled with matter for @xmath0 , it has been shown that any initial anisotropy in a bi universe quickly dies away and a bi universe eventually evolves into a frw universe   @xcite .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , this feature of the bi universe makes it a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations . in light of the importance",
    "mentioned above , several authors have studied bi universe from different aspects . in these papers we considered the nonlinear spinor field , as well as a system of interacting spinor and scalar fields . beside the spinor fields , we also study the role of a @xmath1 term in the evolution of the universe .    as it is mentioned earlier , in our previous papers we limited our study within the scope of bi universe for it s simplicity and it s quick transition to a frw universe in the process of evolution .",
    "but there are few other models , which describe an anisotropic space - time and generate particular interest among physicists  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this report is to study the self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor and anisotropic gravitational fields . as an anisotropic space - time we choose bianchi type vi ( bvi ) model , since a suitable choice of it s parameters evokes few other bianchi models including bi and frw universe .",
    "it can be noted that unlike the bi universe , bvi space - time is an inhomogeneous one .",
    "inclusion of inhomogeneity in the gravitational field significantly complicates the search for an exact solution to the system . in the section 2 ,",
    "we write the equations for nonlinear spinor fields and the system of einstein equations . in this section",
    "we also give their solutions in some general form , more precisely , we write the solutions in terms of a time - depended function that can be defined only given the concrete form of the spinor field nonlinearity . in section 3 ,",
    "we give exact solutions to the equations for some special choices of spinor field nonlinearity and space - time inhomogeneity .",
    "beside this , we also present some numerical solutions in graphical form .",
    "we shall investigate a self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor and einstein gravitational fields .",
    "these two fields are to be codetermined by the following action : @xmath2 with @xmath3 the gravitational part of the lagrangian is given by a bianchi type - vi ( bvi ) space - time , while the spinor part is a usual spinor field lagrangian with an arbitrary nonlinear term .      for a spinor field",
    "@xmath4 , symmetry between @xmath4 and @xmath5 appears to demand that one should choose the symmetrized lagrangian   @xcite .",

    "here @xmath22 are some arbitrary constants and the velocity of light is taken to be unity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the bvi metric models a universe that is anisotropic and inhomogeneous . a suitable choice of @xmath22 as well as the metric functions @xmath21 in the bvi given by evokes the following bianchi - type universes .",

    "let us write the nontrivial components of ricci and riemann tensors as well as christoffel symbols of the bvi metric .",

    "though , in 4d riemann space there are 14 independent invariants , it is sufficient to study only three of them , namely the scalar curvature @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the kretschmann scalar @xmath42 . from the riemann and ricci tensors written above one can easily write find @xmath43 , \\qquad \\tau = a b c,\\ ] ] whereas @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
