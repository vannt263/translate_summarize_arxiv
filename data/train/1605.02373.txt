    "canonical transformations have played a key role in the development of various branches of physics .",
    "they remain an important tool in tackling new problems , often capturing the essence of the underlying physics .",
    "e.g , _ the case for the firsov - lang transformation applied to the polaron problem or the bogolibov transformation of superconductivity  @xcite . +",
    "a particular important transformation is the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , a canonical transformation applied to a hamiltonian @xmath0 which is followed by a projection into a subspace of the hilbert space associated with @xmath0 with the aim of obtaining an effective hamiltonian for the low - energy sector of @xmath0 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is usually obtained perturbatively and the calculation of higher - order terms is often cumbersome .",
    "the schrieffer - wolff transformation was originally introduced by schrieffer and wolff to demonstrate that the low - energy behavior of the anderson model in the local - moment regime is that of a quantum spin coupled isotropically via an anti - ferromagnetic exchange interaction to the local spin - density of an otherwise free conduction band  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by constructing the generator of a canonical transformation which removes charge fluctuations from the effective hamiltonian in lowest order in the hybridization , followed by a projection into the singly occupied subspace of the local ( impurity ) hilbert space .",
    "an alternate form of the schrieffer - wolff transformation from the anderson to the kondo model is due to hewson  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective hamiltonian in the singly occupied subspace is constructed by starting from the schrdinger equation and eliminating the components of the groundstate wavefunction in the empty and doubly occupied subspace . in recent years ,",
    "there has been renewed interest in the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite . a detailed review and",
    "a compilation of rigorous results of the schrieffer - wolff transformation can be found in ref .",
    "the application of the schrieffer - wolff method to systems coupled to dissipative environments appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite while refs .",
    "@xcite reported applications to systems that contain more than one quantum impurity .",
    "one of the major difficulties with the schrieffer - wolff transformation in either of these operator based versions is the determination of higher order terms beyond those quadratic in the hybridization between the local and conduction electrons .",
    "this makes generalizations to more complex models tedious . here , we will present a path integral formulation of the schrieffer - wolff transformation which not only simplifies the construction of higher order terms of the transformation as the operator algebra is replaced by ( anti-)commuting fields but which can also be straightforwardly generalized to more complex situation like _ e.g. _ interacting bath modes .",
    "moreover , our approach brings out the geometric or berry phase associated with dynamics in the reduced hilbert space  @xcite and allows for an analysis of the effect of charge fluctuations on the berry phase term . among the possible applications of our approach",
    "are multi - impurity systems and systems with generalized baths .",
    "this may not only be of relevance in addressing the effect of charge fluctuations in kondo lattice systems .",
    "it should generally prove useful whenever the topological term generated by restricting the dynamics to the sub - space turns out to be non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of berry phase effects may also shed new light on certain quantum phase transitions where dynamics is an integral part of criticality  @xcite and where the berry phase term in the associated effective action invalidates a naive quantum - to - classical mapping  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , our approach might prove useful in constructing effective models for the real - time dynamics of nano - electro - mechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the anderson and kondo model and briefly review the traditional operator - based formulation of the schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "section [ piversion ] introduces our path integral version of the schrieffer - wolff transformation . in section [ sec : gauge ] two explicit forms of the dynamical or berry phase term of the spin path integral are obtained depending on the explicit form of the gauge transformation performed in section [ piversion ] .",
    "section [ sec : gauge ] ends with a discussion of the effect of different hubbard - stratonovich transformations on the schrieffer - wolff transformation . in section [ sec : magt ] , and we apply the path integral version of the schrieffer - wolff transformation to the magnetic single - electron transistor , where the leads are formed by ferromagnetic metals .",
    "as expected  @xcite the effective low - energy model is a sub - ohmic bose - fermi kondo model  @xcite . in [ appa ] , we derive the effective action of a metallic ferromagnet which is needed in section [ sec : magt ] .",
    "the concluding section , _",
    "i.e. _ section [ sec : conclusion ] , contains a brief summary of our results .",
    "the anderson impurity model is a paradigmatic model of strong electron correlations .",
    "it describes an impurity state that can at most be doubly occupied by electrons with spin quantum number @xmath1 and which hybridizes with conduction electrons of an otherwise uncorrelated electron band .",
    "it is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy of the singly occupied impurity state with respect to the fermi energy of the conduction band , @xmath4 is the coulomb integral , and @xmath5 is a measure of the strength of hybridization between the local and conduction electron states . if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , the low - energy sector of the anderson model is equivalent to the kondo model plus a potential scattering term @xmath11 this equivalence in the low - energy sector is established through a canonical transformation  @xcite @xmath12 where hermiticity of the hamiltonian implies @xmath13 and the generator @xmath14 of the transformation is chosen such that the hybridization vanishes to lowest order in @xmath15 , @xmath16=\\sum_{{\\bf k},\\sigma=\\pm}\\big ( v_{\\bf k } c^\\dagger_{{\\bf k}\\sigma}d^{}_{\\sigma } + v_{\\bf k}^ { * } d^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma}c^{}_{{\\bf k}\\sigma } \\big),\\ ] ] followed by a projection into the singly occupied subspace .",

    "in this section we will derive the path integral version of the schrieffer - wolff transformation . in its most general form",
    ", a schrieffer - wolff transformation creates an effective hamiltonian describing the dynamics in a sub space of the total phase space of the original problem by reducing the number of fock states accessible to the system .",
    "a path integral reformulation of this type of canonical transformations is highly desirable as the functional integral description avoids the cumbersome anti- or commutator algebra and often offers insights into the problem that are hard to obtain via the operator calculus",
    ". this may be particularly relevant when a knowledge of higher order corrections is required .",
    "the path integral is the tool of choice when it comes to integrating out part of the fluctuation spectrum , _",
    "e.g. _ charge fluctuations in the case of the standard kondo problem , or to implement holonomic constraints on the dynamics of the system .",
    "a restriction to a sub space of the original fock space will in general lead to a geometric phase term that reflects the dynamics restricted to the sub - space . in order to identify the resulting action as that associated with an effective hamiltonian , both the hamiltonian part and the geometric part of the action have to be local in ( imaginary ) time .",
    "this requires an identification of the underlying manifold as a group manifold and points to the importance of properly treating the symmetries inherent to the problem .",
    "naturally , one expects that a path integral version exists for a canonical transformation , like the schrieffer - wolff transformation , that can be performed on the hamiltonian level .",
    "one property that should come out of a proper path integral treatment of the schrieffer - wolff transformation is the spin - isotropy of the effective model associated with the low - energy sector of the anderson model . at this point",
    "it is useful to realize that the interaction term of the local part of the anderson hamiltonian possesses spin - rotational invariance .",
    "this can _ e.g. _ be seen by noticing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : anderson ] ) is equivalent to @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
