    "the recent results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite indicate the formation of a thermalized medium endowed with large collective flow and very low viscosity @xcite .",
    "these findings suggest that quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a strongly interacting system for temperatures close to its transition temperature ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "apart from the experimental indications , the most convincing evidence in favour of the existence of a strongly interacting qgp comes form the lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "these non - perturbative studies show that the thermodynamic quantities , like pressure and energy density , deviate form there respective ideal gas ( of free quarks and gluons ) values by about @xmath3 even at temperature @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "other lattice studies indicate the smallness of the viscous forces in qgp @xcite . all these results point to the fact that close to @xmath2 nature of qgp is far from a gas of free quarks and gluons .    in order to uncover the nature of qgp in the vicinity of @xmath2 and also to understand the underlying physics of these lattice results many different suggestions have been made over the last decade .",
    "descriptions in terms of various quasi - particles @xcite , resummed perturbation theories @xcite , effective models @xcite  are few among many such attempts . apart from all these",
    ", the newly proposed model of shuryak and zahed @xcite has generated considerable amount of interest in the recent years .",
    "motivated by the lattice results for the existence of charmonium in qgp @xcite , this model proposed a strongly interacting chromodynamic system of quasi - particles ( with large thermal masses ) of quarks , anti - quarks and gluons along with their numerous bound states .",
    "as different conserved charges , , baryon number ( @xmath5 ) , electric charge ( @xmath6 ) , third component of isospin ( @xmath7 ) , are carried by different flavours ( @xmath8 ) of quarks , in the conventional quasi - particle models , conserved charges come in strict proportion to number of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 quarks .",
    "thus conserved charges are strongly correlated with the flavours and the flavours have no correlations among themselves . on the other hand , in the model of @xcite , presence of bound states",
    "demand correlations among different flavours .",
    "hence correlations between conserved charges and flavours depend on the mass - spectrum of the bound states and the strong correlations among them are lost .",
    "based on the above arguments , in @xcite , it has been suggested that the quantity c_bs = -3 , can be used to probe the degrees of freedom of qgp . here",
    "@xmath12 is the net baryon number and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the numbers of net ( quarks minus anti - quarks ) up - quarks , down - quarks and strange - quarks respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath16 denotes average taken over a suitable ensemble .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that for qgp where quarks are the effective degrees of freedom , , where correlations among @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are absent , @xmath17 will have a value of @xmath18 for all temperature @xmath19 . on the other hand , for the model of @xcite @xmath20 at @xmath21 , while for a gas of hadron resonances @xmath22 .",
    "thus the knowledge of @xmath17 helps to identify the degrees of freedom in qgp .    by extending the idea of @xcite ,",
    "recently in @xcite , many ratios like c_(kl)/l= , [ eq.ratio ] have been calculated using lattice qcd simulations with two flavours of dynamical light quarks and three flavours ( two light and one heavy ) of valance quarks . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the susceptibilities corresponding to conserved charge @xmath25 and correlation among conserved charges @xmath26 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the physical meaning of the ratios like @xmath27 can be interpreted as follows create an excitation with quantum number @xmath25 and then observe the value of a different quantum number @xmath26 associated with this excitation .",
    "thus these ratios identify the quantum numbers corresponding to different excitations and hence provide information about the degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculations of @xcite found no evidence for the existence of bound states @xcite even at temperatures very close to @xmath2 .",
    "these finding are consistent with the results of @xcite , where the hypothesis of @xcite has been tested by investigating the ratios of higher order baryon number susceptibilities obtained from lattice simulations .    as these lattice studies @xcite involved simulations with dynamical quarks",
    ", they were done using small lattices having temporal lattice size @xmath28 . by comparing with the results from quenched simulations",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath27 do not depend on @xmath29 for temperature @xmath30 .",
    "it is clearly important to verify whether the same conclusion holds even close to @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , it is known that in the case of quenched qcd with standard staggered quarks the diagonal quark number susceptibilities ( qns ) have strong dependence on the lattice spacing even for the free theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the off - diagonal qns are identically zero for an ideal gas and acquires non - zero value only in the presence of interactions .",
    "so the lattice spacing dependence of the off - diagonal qns is likely to be more complicated , as opposed to that for the diagonal qns where these corrections are dominated by the lattice artifacts of the naive staggered action .",
    "thus if these two qns become comparable the ratios mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ eq.ratio ] ) can have non - trivial dependence on the lattice spacing @xmath31 and hence the continuum limit of these ratios can be different from that obtained using small lattices . since the perturbative expressions for diagonal and off - diagonal qns ( for vanishingly small quark mass and chemical potential ) are respectively @xcite 1 + o(g^2 ) -   g^6 g^-1 , [ eq.pert ] it is reasonable to expect that the off - diagonal qns may not be negligible at the vicinity of @xmath2 where the coupling @xmath32 is large . as the contributions of the bound states in the qns become more and more important as one approaches @xmath2 @xcite , on the lattice it is necessary to investigate the continuum limit of the these ratios of in order to verify the existence of bound states in a strongly coupled qgp",
    "at present a continuum extrapolation of this kind can only be performed using quenched approximation due to the limitations of present day computational resources . a quenched result for these ratios will also provide an idea about the dependence of these ratios on the sea quark mass .",

    "it has also been argued that for two light flavours if one considers the contributions of the baryons only then close to @xmath2 the ratio of 2-nd order isospin susceptibility ( @xmath138 ) to the 2-nd order baryonic susceptibility ( @xmath139 ) is @xmath140 .",

    "whereas , the lattice results for @xmath104 are negative and much smaller in magnitudes .",
    "this suggest that the contribution of the mesons ( also possibly of the quarks , diquarks and @xmath143-states ) are definitely important in the isospin susceptibility @xmath144 .",
    "if one takes into account of the contributions of the mesons ( pions and rhos ) and assumes that the boltzmann weight of the mesons are equal to that of the baryon one gets a lower bound for @xmath145 , namely @xmath146 @xcite .",
