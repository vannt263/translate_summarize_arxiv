    "the hotspots of powerful frii radio sources , as observed in the radio , have long been believed to be the observable consequence of a strong terminal shock at the end of the relativistic jets that feed the radio lobes .",
    "this picture has to be modified somewhat in the light of the fact that a large number of lobes contain more than one hotspot when observed at high resolution @xcite .",
    "conventionally the most compact feature , which is universally the one that lies at the end of the jet when the jet termination can be observed , is called the ` primary ' hotspot , while the others are known as ` secondary ' hotspots . since standard shock acceleration and energy loss models",
    "are often good fits to the radio - to - optical spectra of both primary and secondary hotspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems likely that in many cases the secondary hotspots are also being powered by bulk kinetic energy from the jet .    for some time it has been clear that it is not possible to explain the x - ray emission from hotspots with a single model .",
    "some objects show hotspot x - ray emission with a spectrum consistent with the predictions of a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model , in which the synchrotron - emitting electrons inverse - compton ( ic ) scatter synchrotron photons into the x - ray band ; in these objects there is good agreement between the observed flux density and the predictions of an ssc model with a magnetic field close to the value expected for equipartition of energy between the magnetic field and the radiating electrons , and so their x - ray emission is attributed to the ssc process ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter h02 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "objects such as 3c390.3 @xcite and pictor  a @xcite show x - ray emission that is clearly much stronger than the ssc model would predict if the magnetic field had the equipartition value , together with a spectrum that is steeper than the low - frequency radio spectrum , and hence too steep to be inverse - compton ( @xcite ; h02 ) . in some , but not all , of these cases , a simple synchrotron spectrum ( by which we mean a single power law or a broken , steepening power law in frequency ) is a good fit to the radio , optical and x - ray data points .",
    "in addition , there are several sources ( the best example being 3c351 : h02 ) where the x - ray structure is clearly different from that seen in the radio maps , which is impossible in a simple ssc model with a homogeneous magnetic field and electron distribution . in a synchrotron model for some or all of the x - rays , differences in the spatial structure are to be expected , since the synchrotron loss timescale for x - ray emitting electrons ( tens of years in a typical equipartition magnetic field ) is orders of magnitude less than that for radio - emitting electrons ( @xmath0 years ) ; in fact , in a non - steady - state situation ( as expected from numerical simulations , e.g. @xcite ) time - varying differences in both spatial and spectral distributions of the radio and x - ray emitting electrons are more or less required by the physics .    until now , however , it has not been clear _ why _",
    "some hotspots x - ray emission is adequately modeled by the ssc process with an equipartition field , while others require an additional component or a lower than equipartion field strength .",
    "suggested explanations have involved ( 1 ) a lower magnetic field strength in the x - ray bright hotspots , which both increases ic emission and increases the loss lifetime of x - ray synchrotron - emitting electrons @xcite ; or ( 2 ) the effects of differential relativistic beaming , due to decelerating bulk motions in the hotspots , on the synchrotron and ic spectra , in particular the fact that fast - moving parts of the flow see the slow - moving downstream flow doppler - boosted @xcite , which helps to account for the fact that many of the early detections of x - ray bright hotspots involved broad - line radio galaxies or quasars ( h02 ) , which in unified models should lie relatively close to the line of sight .",
    "the small number of published detections of x - ray hotspots has made it difficult to arrive at a definitive answer .    since the appearance of earlier work aimed explicitly at detecting hotspots @xcite a number of hotspots have been detected in _",
    "_ observations of frii radio galaxies and quasars made for other purposes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this has motivated us to collate all existing data on the hotspots of 3c radio sources from the _ chandra _ archive and analyse them in a systematic way , with the aim of determining trends and testing models . in this paper",
    "we report our results .    throughout the paper",
    "we use a cosmology in which @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "spectral indices @xmath5 are the energy indices and are defined in the sense @xmath6 .",
    "we searched the public _",
    "archives for all observations of frii radio sources in the 3c catalogue made with the ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , supplementing them with a few observations that we have access to and are not yet public . to make our sample as large as possible ,",
    "we included any 3c frii source listed in the archives ; this means that we made use of several sources that are not in the better - defined 3cr @xcite or 3crr @xcite samples .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the 3c sources simply because they almost all have good radio observations available in the public nrao very large array ( vla ) archives .",
    "we excluded compact steep - spectrum sources whose hotspots would not be resolved from the agn or lobe emission with _",
    "chandra_. these selection criteria gave us a sample of 36 sources ( table [ obs ] ) .",
    "we next obtained electronic radio maps for all the sources in our sample .",
    "where we did not already have access to a good , high - resolution radio map , or to appropriate published radio flux densities , we retrieved the best available data from the vla archive . in selecting the observations we preferred data at 5 and 8 ghz in the a configuration ( the largest configuration of the vla ) , which gives good sensitivity , good separation of lobes and hotspots due to their spectral index differences , and an angular resolution comparable to that of _ chandra_. properties of the radio data used and",
    "maps made are given in table [ radioobs ] .",
    "we then used the radio maps as a guide to search for emission from hotspots .",
    "we defined a hotspot less strictly than some other workers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) both in order to make the comparison between radio and x - ray simpler and because our aim is to include the structure apparently associated with the jet termination whenever possible .",
    "in practice , we considered any relatively compact , isolated radio feature that was significantly brighter than its surroundings to be a hotspot ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "however , we excluded any emission that we considered to be associated with a jet ; any compact x - ray feature positionally coincident with , or closer to the nucleus than , a linear radio feature that met the definition of @xcite , was considered to be a ` jet knot ' rather than a hotspot . by doing this",
    "we hoped to select only features associated with the termination of the jet , and to avoid effects thought to be due to highly relativistic bulk motions , as seen in the x - ray jets of some quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . later in the paper (  [ jk ] ) we shall return to the question of whether hotspots tell us anything about the emission from jet knots or jets in general .    using the radio data as a guide",
    ", we were able to identify a number of previously unreported x - ray counterparts to hotspots , in the 10 friis 3c6.1 , 3c47 , 3c109 , 3c173.1 , 3c228 , 3c321 , 3c324 , 3c334 , 3c403 and 3c452 . the results on 3c403 and 3c228 ,",
    "334 will be reported in more detail elsewhere ( respectively in r.  kraft et al . , and d.m .",
    "worrall et al . , in preparation ) ; images of the newly detected x - ray hotspots for the other sources are presented in appendix a. in almost all cases there were a few tens of total counts in the hotspots in the 0.55 kev range .",
    "since this is too few to fit spectra , we used the standard _",
    "analysis software ciao to generate redistribution matrix ( rmf ) and ancilliary response ( arf ) files appropriate for the hotspots , using the psextract tool , corrected for the time - dependent excess acis absorption using apply_acisabs , and then used the model - fitting software xspec to determine the normalization of a power law , with @xmath7 and galactic absorption , that reproduced the observed net count rate .",
    "we chose this power - law index because our aim was to test the validity of the ssc model , which ` predicts ' @xmath7 , on the basis of the assumption that the low - energy electron energy index has the value 2.0 associated with particle acceleration at a non - relativistic strong shock ( as appears to be the case in some , though not all , well - studied hotspots : @xcite ) .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath5 makes relatively little difference to the normalization of the power law , and thus to the inferred 1-kev flux density in the observer s frame ; using @xmath8 would increase the inferred flux density by between 10 and 20% .",
    "the 1-kev flux densities assuming @xmath9 for each source are given in table [ fluxes ] .",
    "for the 10 sources 3c9 , 3c184 , 3c200 , 3c212 , 3c215 , 3c219 , 3c220.1 , 3c401 , 3c427.1 and 3c438 we found no x - ray emission associated with the hotspots , as previously reported in some cases . where there was a compact ( arcsec or sub - arcsec ) radio hotspot present we determined @xmath10 upper limits on the corresponding x - ray flux density in a 10-pixel detection cell based on poisson statistics and the local background count rate .",
    "some of these sources ( e.g. 3c401 and 3c438 , @xcite ) exhibit no compact hotspots in the radio , and we elected not to determine an upper limit on their emission , as the selection of an appropriate x - ray region is difficult .",
    "for the same reason , we did not determine an upper limit for the barely resolved source 3c184 , which shows x - ray emission coincident with the radio lobe but not particularly the hotspot @xcite .",
    "we re - examined previously reported hotspot detections in the 16 sources 3c123 @xcite , 3c179 @xcite , 3c207 @xcite , 3c254 @xcite , 3c263 ( h02 ) , 3c265 @xcite , 3c275.1 @xcite , 3c280 @xcite , 3c281 @xcite , 3c294 @xcite , 3c295 @xcite , 3c303 @xcite , 3c330 ( h02 ) , 3c351 ( @xcite ; h02 ) , 3c390.3 @xcite , and cygnus a ( 3c405 : @xcite ) . in all but one case we confirmed the existence of one or more compact x - ray features associated with the radio hotspots ( the exception is 3c281 , where the previously reported x - ray emission appears to be diffuse and associated with the lobe , and is most likely due to ic scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the lobe rather than ssc from the hotspots ) .",
    "where a 1-kev flux density had been previously determined from spectral fitting , we make use of that in table [ fluxes ] .",
    "otherwise , we adopted the same procedure as for the newly detected sources described above .",
    "finally , for all the newly detected and known sources , we determined upper limits , again as described above , for any compact hotspots that were not detected ( e.g. in the lobe on the opposite side of the nucleus to the known hotspot ) . in the process of doing this we found one additional hotspot , 3c123 w , that was formally significantly detected ; although the situation in this source is confused by the presence of strong , unrelaxed cluster emission @xcite we added it to the sample as a detection , for consistency with the other sources . because of its intrinsic interest and the extreme nature of its x - ray hotspot , we added pictor a @xcite to the sample ( it is not in 3c because of its low declination , but meets the other selection criteria ) .",
    "the overall final sample thus contains 37 sources ( table [ obs ] ) with 65 x - ray hotspot flux densities or upper limits .",
    "all the fluxes and upper limits are tabulated in table [ fluxes ] .",
    "finally , for the sources with detected x - ray hotspots , we used the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive to search for optical counterparts .",
    "optical emission is important because it constrains the spectrum between radio and x - ray ; early work on ssc hotspots was supported by the observation that a one - zone synchrotron model could not be fitted through the radio and x - ray data points because of the optical constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we identified two new candidate optical hotspot counterparts ( in 3c228 and 3c275.1 ) and measured flux densities or upper limits for a number of other sources , using the iraf package synphot to calculate the conversion factor between observed counts and flux density .",
    "optical flux densities and frequencies are tabulated in table [ hst ] .",
    "sources where there were no archival _ hst _ observations , where the hotspot did not lie on the wfpc-2 ccds , or where observational constraints such as a nearby bright star or cosmic ray contamination prevented us from obtaining a flux density , are not tabulated .",
    "we also tabulate a number of flux densities , largely based on ground - based observations , taken from other papers , either in the literature or in preparation .",
    "the large number of detected x - ray hotspots is interesting in itself , given that calculations based on ssc emission at equipartition suggested that only the few brightest hotspots would be detected with _",
    "chandra _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to assess quantitatively the extent to which the new detections conflict with an ssc model , we decided to fit a simple ssc model to all the hotspots and determine the ratio between the observed and predicted flux densities .",
    "we carried out this calculation using the code of @xcite ; a brief sketch of the operation of this code is given in appendix b. the code assumes a spherically symmetric , homogenous hotspot with an electron energy spectrum that can be described as a power law or broken power law . to determine the radius of the hotspot , we therefore fitted models consisting of a homogeneous sphere convolved with the restoring beam to the highest - resolution radio data available , in the manner described by h02 . where multi - frequency radio data were available for the hotspot , which was only true in the best - studied cases , we used them to fit a two - component power - law model with an energy spectral break corresponding to @xmath11 @xcite ; otherwise we assumed a single power law with @xmath9 extending from the radio into the mm - wave regime .",
    "unless good low - frequency radio constraints were available , we assumed that the minimum lorentz factor of the electrons , @xmath12 , was 1000 ; @xmath13 was chosen to ensure that there was no spectral cutoff before the mm - wave region .",
    "these choices reflect what has been found in the best - studied hotspots , but are clearly no substitute for good , multi - frequency observations , particularly at high frequencies . however , we estimate that these choices make a difference at the level of at most @xmath1420% ( except in the rare cases where a @xmath15 ghz spectral cutoff is present ) .",
    "the results are particularly insensitive to the choice of @xmath12 , since decreasing this has two effects which act in opposite directions : more high - energy photons are scattered by the large additional population of low - energy electrons , but the overall electron energy power law normalization is reduced to maintain equipartition .",
    "detailed spatial modeling , where high - resolution observations make it possible , also changes the results of ssc calculations at the 1020% level ( h02 ) , so that overall the calculated value should be a good estimate of the true inverse - compton prediction .",
    "the equipartition flux density prediction ( taking into account both ssc and ic scattering of cmb photons ) and the ratio @xmath16 between the observed and predicted flux densities is tabulated in table [ fluxes ] for each hotspot .",
    "note that in almost all cases the flux due to the ssc process dominates over that due to ic scattering of the cmb ( assuming no relativistic beaming ) by an order of magnitude or more . for simplicity we shall often refer to the calculated fluxes as ssc fluxes in what follows .",
    "the tabulated values of @xmath16 are calculated assuming that there are no protons , so that equipartition is between the radiating electrons and magnetic fields only , and that the filling factor of the hotspots is unity .",
    "if we were to include an energetically dominant population of protons in equipartition in our model , it would reduce the predicted inverse - compton emission ( since the number of electrons decreases ) and so increase the ratio @xmath16 , possibly by a large factor .",
    "if the ratio of proton to electron energy densities were in the ratio of their rest masses , @xmath16 values would increase by about a factor 3070 .",
    "even if the proton to electron energy densities were of the order of their number ratios as observed in cosmic rays at the earth ( an energy - dependent factor of @xmath17@xmath18 , @xcite ) we would expect @xmath16 to increase by a factor @xmath19@xmath20 . a population of protons with the _ same _ total energy as the electrons has a less dramatic effect , increasing @xmath16 by only about 40% .",
    "in any case , it is clear that introducing protons can not solve the problem of high-@xmath16 hotspots",
    ". the predicted ssc inverse - compton emission can be increased , and @xmath16 can be decreased , if we have overestimated the volume or the filling factor , though ( depending on the space - filling fluid ) the actual results of a low filling factor can be very geometry - dependent  if the electrons are confined to thin sheets , so that the probability of scattering is comparatively low , then the effects of low filling factor can be less than expected",
    ". roughly ( see appendix b ) , to reduce @xmath16 by a factor of 1000 , and so to make the most extreme observed hotspots consistent with being inverse - compton emission at equipartition , we would need to reduce the volume or the filling factor by a factor @xmath21 , and this neglects geometrical effects .",
    "such low filling factors are clearly implausible .    fig .",
    "[ histo ] shows the distribution of the ratio @xmath16 and upper limits on @xmath16 for the sample .",
    "points are immediately obvious : firstly , the detected x - ray flux density lies significantly above the ic prediction in most sources ; secondly , there are few detected sources with @xmath22 , and there is a clear change in the distribution of sources at around @xmath23 .",
    "if the upper limits on x - ray flux for the non - detected sources all lie a long way above the true values , then this could change , but if it does not , the special status of @xmath24 implies that few sources have _ less _ x - ray emission than would be expected on the equipartition ssc / ic model .",
    "this could suggest either that all sources have ssc / ic x - ray emission at a level consistent with the equipartition prediction , together with some additional source of x - ray emission , or that there are departures from equipartition  some quite large  but that these are always in the sense that @xmath25 .",
    "the fact that we do not see many sources with @xmath26 suggests that there are few or no hotspots with @xmath27 , though without detections of all the hotspots we can not be more definite .    if the model we have used to predict the level of inverse - compton emission is incorrect , then the special status of @xmath24 would have to be a coincidence .",
    "this , as we have argued before ( e.g.  h02 ) gives us a reason to disfavor models with an energetically dominant proton population , or with consistently very low filling factor .",
    "thus , for example , if the proton - to - electron energy density ratio were @xmath28 , we would expect a source in equipartition , and emitting in x - rays only via the ssc process , to have @xmath29@xmath30 given our model ( since we would be _ overpredicting _ the inverse - compton emission ) ; we would not see a special status for @xmath23 unless other parameters ( such as filling factor ) conspired systematically to increase the value of @xmath16 , which is inherently improbable .",
    "we emphasise that , given the small numbers and the width of the distribution of @xmath16 values , this does not rule out moderate filling factors or a proton population within a factor of @xmath15 of the energy density in the other components .",
    "what emission mechanisms are possible for the detected hotspots ? we began by calculating another parameter , @xmath31 , the ratio between the observed x - ray flux density and the flux predicted from a simple power - law extrapolation ( with @xmath32 ) from the radio data .",
    "hotspots with both @xmath33 and @xmath34 would represent a problem for both synchrotron and inverse - compton models .",
    "however , we find that @xmath31 is almost always less than 1 , so there are no sources whose x - ray flux is impossible to explain with a synchrotron model in this sense . the plot of @xmath31 against @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ rrp ] ) shows that even the most extreme x - ray hotspots , in terms of @xmath16 , can readily be accounted for with a synchrotron model .",
    "there is a smooth distribution in parameter space , with no obvious bimodality , between sources with @xmath35 , @xmath33 ( where a synchrotron model is natural ) and @xmath24 , @xmath36 ( where an inverse - compton model has tended to be adopted in earlier work ) .",
    "insets in fig .",
    "[ rrp ] show the very different seds of sources at the extreme ends of the distribution , and also illustrate the importance of optical constraints in determining the x - ray emission mechanism .",
    "to investigate this further , we used the available optical data or upper limits for x - ray detected hotspots to constrain their spectral shape .",
    "we calculated the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the two - point radio to optical and optical to x - ray spectral indices , for all the x - ray detected hotspots with optical flux densities or upper limits .",
    "a hotspot in which the optical to x - ray spectrum is flatter than the radio to optical spectrum ( @xmath39 ) can not be described by a simple one - zone synchrotron model in which the spectrum steepens with increasing frequency .",
    "the difference between the two spectral indices is plotted in fig .",
    "[ optical ] as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "it can be seen that the more extreme hotspots ( large @xmath16 values ) all have @xmath40 , and so are consistent with a synchrotron model .",
    "a non - synchrotron model is required by the optical data only for a few low-@xmath16 objects , where inverse - compton emission is the accepted and most plausible x - ray mechanism .",
    "the existing data do not rule out a model in which synchrotron x - ray emission is important in a significant number of our target objects , although this is far from conclusive given the large number of optical non - detections .    what determines the value of @xmath16 for a particular hotspot ?",
    "we noted that the early detections of ssc emission , such as cygnus a , 3c295 and 3c123 , were all in luminous sources , while well - studied problematic sources such as 3c390.3 and pictor a are much lower in overall radio luminosity .",
    "accordingly , we looked for a relationship between @xmath16 and total 178-mhz luminosity from the original 3c measurements or the revised values of @xcite ( correcting by a factor 1.09 so as to bring the flux densities on to the scale of @xcite , and using low - frequency spectral indices to correct to the rest frame ) , obtaining the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ s178r ] . the inverse correlation seen here appears to indicate a role of the source luminosity in determining @xmath16 .",
    "the correlation is improved if we plot the luminosity of only the hotspot against @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ hslr ] ) ; here we have used measurements from the radio maps , correcting to a rest - frame frequency of 5 ghz by assuming a radio spectral index of 0.5 .",
    "the improvement suggests that the relationship with hotspot luminosity is primary , and that the correlation with overall source luminosity arises because of the correlation between hotspot and source luminosity .",
    "it is important to realise that these plots are not necessarily an indication of a one - to - one correlation between @xmath16 and hotspot or total source luminosity .",
    "firstly , _",
    "s sensitivity ( around 0.1 njy at 1 kev for the exposure times used in these observations ) means that we would not expect to detect the ssc emission from the lowest - luminosity hotspots , so that it is observationally impossible to populate the bottom left - hand corner of fig .",
    "[ hslr ] , as shown by the dotted lines illustrating the observational limits .",
    "secondly , there is a positive correlation between the predicted ssc flux density and the hotspot luminosity , since the sample is flux - limited and the ssc luminosity is a non - linear function of the hotspot luminosity ( for a given hotspot size ) and this increases the strength of the apparent correlation .",
    "however , there is at least one key result from this analysis ; _ there are no hotspots with high luminosity and high @xmath16 _  we would certainly have been able to detect such hotspots if they existed . by contrast , low - luminosity hotspots appear to be able to have extremely high @xmath16 values , though we can not say definitely that all of them do .",
    "we find no other relationships between @xmath16 and hotspot or source parameters such as hotspot angular or linear size , source size , redshift , or radio spectral index . however , there are relationships between @xmath16 and other derived quantities such as equipartition magnetic field energy density and photon energy density ( fig .",
    "[ energies ] ) ; these are not surprising , since all of the quantities are related to radio luminosity .",
    "we return to the possible physical significance of these relationships below (  [ synch ] ) .    finally , we investigated the role of beaming in determining the x - ray brightness of hotspots by plotting the @xmath16 parameter against the core prominence , defined here as the ratio of 5-ghz core flux density to ( rest - frame ) 178-mhz total source flux density .",
    "core prominence is often used as a proxy of beaming ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , relying on the assumption that the _ intrinsic _ fraction of the radio source flux emitted by the core is similar in all sources and that the observed variation in core prominence arises from relativistic beaming in the parsec - scale jet . using the core flux densities tabulated in table [ obs ] , we produced the plot shown in fig .",
    "this figure certainly shows a trend , in the sense that ( as was already clear ) many of the x - ray over - bright hotspots are in beamed sources , and often on the same side as a known one - sided radio jet . at the same time",
    ", there is clearly a good deal of scatter in any correlation  up to 2.5 orders of magnitude separate sources with similar core prominences  and there are sources that do not fit it at all , such as the low core - prominence , narrow - line source 3c403 ( @xmath41 ) . if we plot core prominence against hotspot radio luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ cphsl ] ) we see that there is a tendency for sources with high core prominences to have low - luminosity hotspots , a trend that can be explained entirely in terms of a bias towards broad - line radio galaxies and quasars at low redshifts in the parent sample , so that it is not clear that the trend seen in fig .",
    "[ hscp ] is meaningful . although the quasars and broad - line radio galaxies ( in unified models , the sources that should be most strongly affected by beaming ) tend to lie at the upper edge of the envelope of @xmath16 values for a given luminosity range , the dominant effect is the luminosity dependence .",
    "a partial kendall s @xmath42 analysis taking into account the upper limits , performed according to the prescription of @xcite and using their code , shows that the correlation between @xmath16 and core prominence is not significant at the 95% confidence level if the luminosity correlation is taken into account , while the correlation between @xmath16 and luminosity is significant even given the core prominence relation .",
    "so , with the current data , we have no significant evidence for a relationship between hotspot @xmath16 value and beaming , and the apparent correlation of fig .",
    "[ hscp ] must be regarded as suggestive at best .",
    "what models can account for these observations ?",
    "we examine several in turn .",
    "one obvious possibility is that the high @xmath16 values reflect a significant departure from equipartition ; the belief that equipartition fields exist in hotspots is , after all , a result of the study of the most luminous hotspots ( chosen because of their high predicted ssc flux densities ) .",
    "the departure from equipartition in terms of the ratio of equipartition to true magnetic field strengths , @xmath43 , is approximately @xmath44 , so that the magnetic field strength would have to be a factor @xmath45 lower than the equipartition value in the hotspots with the highest @xmath16 values .",
    "we can rule out a simple and attractive model in which such low magnetic fields account entirely for the luminosity-@xmath16 correlation . in this toy model ,",
    "all hotspots have similar numbers of electrons and sizes .",
    "the radio luminosity @xmath46 goes as @xmath47 , and the ic luminosity scales in the same way ( so long as the synchrotron photon field remains dominant ) .",
    "but the equipartition prediction for ssc decreases more rapidly , since this depends on the equipartition estimate of electron density , which goes approximately as @xmath48 ( appendix b ) , as well as linearly on the observed photon density .",
    "so we should find that @xmath49 , which is not far from the observed slope .",
    "we should also find that the hotspot radio luminosity scales approximately as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the magnetic field strength required to produce the observed x - ray emission by inverse - compton processes , and this is also just about consistent with the data for our sources .",
    "however , we would not expect to see the observed correlation between 178-mhz _ total _ flux density and @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ s178r ] ) in this picture , unless the same ratio between the true and equipartition magnetic fields persisted throughout the source .",
    "very low fields in lobes are incompatible with observations of lobe inverse - compton emission , among other things ; we see high-@xmath16 hotspots in sources whose lobes clearly do not show the same ratio between the observed and predicted inverse - compton emission from cmb photon scattering ( e.g. 3c403 , r.  kraft et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "more generally , there are several arguments that seem to us to disfavor an ssc model ( to be accurate , ssc plus inverse - compton scattering of the cmb ) with a larger departure from equipartition in lower - power sources :    * we know ( see  1 ) that some high-@xmath16 hotspots x - ray spectra and/or spatial properties are inconsistent with a pure ssc model ( the spectra of the best - studied high-@xmath16 sources are all found to be steep , @xmath52 ) . * in a few well - resolved cases ( e.g. 3c351 , h02 ) the _ local _ value of @xmath16 would be even higher in places than the integrated value we quote , representing an even greater challenge for ssc . *",
    "the fact that a synchrotron model can be fitted through the radio , optical and x - ray points in some high-@xmath16 sources would have to be a coincidence in an ssc model , although this is a weak constraint ; the optical emission might also be ssc , as it is thought to be in a couple of low-@xmath16 sources @xcite .",
    "* an ssc model can not explain the effects of beaming , if these are real ; beaming _ suppresses _ ssc emission , so that we should see a weak anti - correlation with proxies of beaming like core prominence , at least for hotspots on the jet side .",
    "* the special status of @xmath24 suggests that there are few hotspots with @xmath53 : it is not obvious why the departures from equipartition should all be in the sense @xmath25 .",
    "* there is no obvious mechanism that fully explains the observed luminosity dependence of @xmath16 .",
    "a synchrotron model is a good fit to the overall spectrum of some of the most extreme sources , such as 3c390.3 and 3c403 ; if we accept that x - ray synchrotron emission is possible in some hotspots , as it certainly is in the jets of fri sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then it may contribute to many of them . if the ability of a hotspot to produce x - ray synchrotron emission depended on its luminosity , then it might be the case that all hotspots have inverse - compton emission at a level consistent with @xmath24 and equipartition magnetic fields , but that the low - luminosity hotspots have an additional synchrotron component that may greatly exceed the inverse - compton emission",
    ".    it has already been argued in studies of _ optical _ synchrotron hotspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the high - frequency break in the synchrotron spectrum is a function of hotspot luminosity , in the sense that optical emission is much commoner from hotspots of low radio luminosities .",
    "this fact can be explained @xcite in terms of the lower synchrotron loss rates in the lower magnetic fields ( assuming equipartition ) and lower photon densities in hotspots of lower radio luminosity ; we have already seen ( fig .",
    "[ energies ] ) that there is a correlation between these quantities and @xmath16 in our objects . in a standard hotspot spatial / spectral model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the _ break _ in the synchrotron spectrum comes about when we average over both the acceleration region itself and the regions downstream of it , in which synchrotron and inverse - compton losses have had time to have an effect ; we would not expect to see a break if we could resolve the acceleration region from the downstream emission .",
    "the high - frequency _ cutoff _ in the synchrotron spectrum is a direct indicator of physics in the acceleration region , and results from inefficiency in particle acceleration at high energies : most importantly , from our point of view , particle acceleration will become inefficient if the energy loss timescale in the acceleration region ( due to synchrotron and inverse - compton losses ) becomes shorter than the acceleration timescale .",
    "the fact that essentially all our x - ray data points fall on or below the line of an extrapolation from the radio with @xmath54 (  3 ) shows that any luminosity - dependence of synchrotron radiation in the x - ray hotspots can not simply be an effect of a changing frequency of the spectral break , as @xcite argued for optical hotspots ; @xmath55 is the canonical spectral index above the break , so that the break alone can not produce the effect we see .",
    "this interpretation is supported by observations of well - studied luminous hotspots such as 3c405 s , where the overall spectrum requires the _ cutoff _ to be below the x - ray region .",
    "we conclude that the luminosity dependence of @xmath16 must be an effect of the synchrotron cutoff .    a full calculation of the frequency of the cutoff @xmath56 depends on poorly known quantities such as the magnetic field strength in the acceleration region and the diffusion coefficient of relativistic particles . in the simplest case , with uniform magnetic field throughout the hotspot , a diffusion coefficient independent of both magnetic field and electron energy , and a non - relativistic shock",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath57 , with the constant of proportionality depending on the numerical value of the diffusion coefficient , where @xmath58 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath59 the equivalent inverse - compton field strength , defined as @xmath60 , with @xmath61 being the energy density in all photon fields .",
    "@xmath56 in this calculation does exhibit a change over the parameters of the hotspots we have studied that would be sufficient in magnitude to explain the observed effect , although the detailed correlation with @xmath16 is not particularly good ( fig .",
    "[ rnuc ] ) .",
    "@xcite consider two cases with less simplistic forms of the diffusion coefficient ( kolmogorov and bohm diffusion coefficients ) , and are able to calculate corresponding numerical values for @xmath13 ( their eq .",
    "the functional form of @xmath13 for the bohm coefficient means that the cutoff _ frequency _ is essentially constant , and ( for the values quoted by brunetti et al . )",
    "lies well above the x - ray region for all our hotspots ; the kolmogorov coefficient gives a @xmath62 lying well below x - ray frequencies for equipartition magnetic field strengths in all the hotspots .",
    "this illustrates the strong dependence of the expectation on the unknown microphysics of the acceleration process .",
    "the basic principle of this model remains plausible : hotspot luminosity ( and therefore magnetic field and photon energy density ) are controlling the high - energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "any relationship between @xmath16 and core prominence is not easy to explain in a model where much of the x - ray emission is synchrotron .",
    "@xmath16 does not have a simple dependence on beaming parameters in this model : the expected synchrotron flux of the hotspot increases with beaming , but so will the predicted inverse - compton flux density ( from both ssc and cmb scattering ) , since the prediction we make is based on the _ observed _ radio flux density and takes no account of beaming .",
    "we calculated the expected variation of @xmath16 with angle to the line of sight @xmath63 for a source whose intrinsic ( rest - frame ) properties were held constant . for modest beaming factors , corresponding to @xmath64 , we find that @xmath16 does indeed increase as @xmath63 gets smaller , but only for extremely low - luminosity hotspots , in which scattering of cmb photons is the dominant ic process ; for more luminous hotspots the trend is reversed , and we would expect @xmath16 to be largest for hotspots that are beamed away from us ( that is , on the _ counterjet _ side of beamed sources ) . in any case , the amount of variation introduced by this process into the @xmath16 value distribution is small , no more than a factor 2 between minimum and maximum values , for @xmath65 . much higher speeds ( @xmath66 ) would be required , for reasonable hotspot luminosities , to obtain the order of magnitude scatter in the @xmath16 parameter ( after accounting for the luminosity dependence ) that appears to be present in fig .",
    "[ hslr ] .      we have already shown (  [ model ] ) that the apparent relationship between proxies of beaming , such as core prominence , and the x - ray brightness of the hotspot ( h02 ; @xcite ) may at least partly be a selection effect in the available x - ray data .",
    "the current sample of x - ray hotspots , at least at low hotspot luminosities , is strongly biased towards beamed objects , while beamed objects are known to have brighter , more compact , flatter - spectrum hotspots on the jet side .",
    "it is now known that there are narrow - line radio sources that should lie close to the plane of the sky that have high @xmath16 , and a few examples of sources ( for example , 3c228 and 3c321 ) where hotspots on both sides of the source have high @xmath16 .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , whether there is any beaming effect that needs to be explained from an x - ray perspective .",
    "if there _ is _ any beaming effect , then the two models discussed so far both have difficulty in explaining it , so alternative models must be considered . the standard way of explaining the ( effectively ) high @xmath16 values in the x - ray jets of core - dominated quasars is to invoke highly relativistic bulk speeds and the consequent boost of the energy density of the cmb in the rest frame of the jet .",
    "we regard this model as untenable in the present case , for several reasons .",
    "firstly , large bulk lorentz factors are required for even moderate @xmath16 values ( see the discussion of 3c351 in h02 ) and these in turn constrain the source to lie at a small angle to the line of sight ; this can not possibly be the case for all or even most of our high-@xmath16 objects , which are drawn from a low - frequency - selected , lobe - dominated sample , and which include objects that , in unified models , must be close to the plane of the sky .",
    "secondly , in the standard picture , the radio emission from the hotspots comes from the post - shock region , and so high bulk lorentz factors are hard to achieve ; although there are some effects that are best explained by moderate relativistic beaming in the post - shock flow , bulk lorentz factors @xmath15 have never been required by observation , and are in fact inconsistent with the known properties of hotspots .",
    "a more viable model involving beaming effects is that of @xcite ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the picture they describe almost certainly has to be true at some level , but a quantitative test is difficult , since it relies on knowledge of the velocity and electron density structure of the jet upsteam of the hotspot that is hard to obtain observationally .",
    "in addition , this model can not account for all the features of our data , such as the hotspot luminosity dependence of @xmath16 .",
    "however , our data clearly do not rule out a beaming effect at some level and , if it is present , the standard inverse - compton or synchrotron models can not account for it without involving large speeds .",
    "a full test of this type of beaming model must await an unbiased sample of hotspots in which orientation and luminosity effects can be clearly separated .",
    "as discussed in  1 , we have tried to distinguish between hotspots , defined as structures where the well - collimated flow of the jet terminates , and jet knots , where the assumption is that the jet continues more or less unaffected by whatever process produces the increase in synchrotron emissivity .",
    "the key physical differences between the two systems are ( 1 ) that there is probably not a strong shock in frii jet knots , since there is little evidence that the jets decelerate there , and ( 2 ) that the particles in jet knots probably have a shorter dwell time in the region of interest , since the downstream flow speed is likely to be faster , which could lead to spectral differences even if the acceleration processes are similar . in practice",
    "the distinction between the two types of feature is difficult to draw observationally : there are several features that we have considered to be hotspots in our sample ( e.g. , 3c390.3 n , 3c403 f6 , 3c275.1 n ) that might well be jet knots in which the continuing jet is poorly defined .",
    "equally , it must be the case that there is continued collimated flow out of primary hotspots in cases where there is optical or possible x - ray synchrotron emission in the secondary hotspot , requiring _ in situ _ particle acceleration ",
    "3c351 s hotspots j and k are a good example .",
    "we see no observational differences between these borderline jet knot / hotspot sources and clearly defined terminal hotspots .",
    "should we therefore try to apply the results of the present work to jet knots as well as to hotspots ? as we have argued above (  [ dcb ] ) the generally favored jet x - ray emission mechanism for core - dominated quasars can not apply to more than a small subset of our sources , and particularly not the narrow - line objects , some of which exhibit either possible jet - related x - ray knots ( e.g. 3c403 ) or clear jet - related x - ray emission ( e.g. 3c321 and 3c452 in appendix a ) .",
    "the x - ray emission mechanism here seems likely to be synchrotron , as in the jets of low - luminosity fri sources . a full analysis of the known frii jet - related x - ray emission is beyond the scope of the present paper , but from our work on hotspots we can make the ` prediction ' ( borne out by the obserations that we are currently aware of ) that jet - related x - ray synchrotron emission in friis will be seen mostly in low - luminosity jet knots , and therefore should be particularly easy to find in low - luminosity frii sources .",
    "the hotspot behaviour is also qualitatively similar to what is seen in the jets of some powerful quasars , such as 3c273 @xcite , in which the x - ray - to - radio ratio of jet knots decreases as the knot radio flux density increases .",
    "we have shown that the properties of the x - ray emission of hotspots depend strongly on their overall radio luminosity .",
    "high - luminosity hotspots , of the type originally examined in inverse - compton studies , consistently show x - ray emission that is close to being consistent with the predictions of a synchrotron self - compton model with an equipartition magnetic field .",
    "low - luminosity hotspots sometimes ( and maybe always ) have x - ray emission that is much brighter than would be expected in this model . we argue that :    * the good agreement between ic models and data seen for the luminous hotspots continues to suggest that the x - ray emission mechanism in these systems really is synchrotron self - compton , that magnetic fields really are in equipartition , and that populations of protons which dominate energetically by large factors ( @xmath67 ) and/or very small filling factors are not present . *",
    "models in which the unexpectedly strong x - ray emission from some low - luminosity hotspots indicate a large departure from equipartition in these objects are not plausible for a number of reasons : synchrotron emission is more likely . * if a synchrotron model is adopted , the high - frequency cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum must be dependent on luminosity in order to explain the x - ray emission from all hotspots .",
    "this is physically plausible , but a fully quantitative test depends on the microphysics of the acceleration process .",
    "* there is little significant evidence that relativistic beaming is important in the current sample ; an unbiased sample of x - ray hotspots would be of great importance in testing beaming models .",
    "* it may be possible to extend our conclusions on hotspots to the jet - related x - ray features seen in a number of frii sources , particularly those at relatively large angles to the line of sight ; if so , we would expect that they would show the same luminosity dependence , in the sense that only low - luminosity jets would show strong x - ray synchrotron emission . a synchrotron origin for the jets in these sources would suggest a continuity between their properties and those of the lower - power fris , for which a synchrotron interpretation is well established ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "if we know the emissivity @xmath165 , we can use equation [ jnu ] to eliminate @xmath166 from equation [ equip ] @xmath167 and we can now solve for @xmath58 : @xmath168^{2\\over p+5 } \\label{bval}\\ ] ] in practice , we take account of the fact that @xmath169 is not always a power law by numerically integrating equation [ emissi ] and then solving equation [ bsolve ] numerically with a root - finding algorithm , but the main dependences are encapsulated in equation [ bval ] . since the energy density is proportional to @xmath170 , we can see that it increases as @xmath171 ; thus , a non - zero value of @xmath140 affects the magnetic field strength in the expected sense .",
    "moreover , we can now substitute back into equation [ jnu ] to eliminate @xmath58 : this gives @xmath172^{{p+1}\\over{p+5}}\\ ] ] and , since @xmath169 and @xmath148 are known and constant for a given observation and a known source geometry , we can see that the number density of electrons is expected to decrease with increasing @xmath140 : @xmath173 if the geometry is doubtful , the calculated emissivity is a function of volume : @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the observed flux density .",
    "so we expect @xmath176    for sphere of radius @xmath177 with uniform particle and magnetic field density , the synchrotron self - compton emissivity at a given frequency @xmath178 is given by @xcite @xmath179 where @xmath150 is the electron mass , @xmath152 is the speed of light , @xmath180 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath181 is the synchrotron emissivity as a function of frequency , and @xmath182 is a function of @xmath183 , @xmath178 and @xmath184 defined by @xcite .",
    "the code we use performs this integration numerically for a given synchrotron and electron energy spectrum , and also carries out the similar calculation for illumination from the microwave background radiation ; an analytical form of the integral for power - law electron and photon distributions could be derived but is not necessary here .",
    "the key feature of this equation is that the inverse - compton emissivity ( which determines the predicted ic flux density and thus @xmath16 for a given observed flux ) is linear in the number density of electrons @xmath134 , and thus linear in @xmath166 for the power - law analysis we have described above . for a given source , with known spatial and spectral properties , it is the dependence of @xmath166 on @xmath142 given by equation [ n0k ] that primarily determines the value of @xmath16 .",
    "( if the spectrum is not a pure power law , the change in the form of @xmath181 as a result of the change in @xmath58 also has a non - negligible effect . )",
    "if the volume is not known , for example because of a low filling factor , then the dependence of @xmath185 on volume can be determined from above : @xmath186 and",
    "this means that the observed inverse - compton flux density , which is proportional to @xmath187 , goes as @xmath188 .",
    "this is a very weak dependence for plausible @xmath163 values : for @xmath164 , @xmath189 .",
