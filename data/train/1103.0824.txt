    "there exists a general consensus that the description of the gravitational field provided by general relativity ( gr ) is doomed at scales of the order of the planck length , where the spacetime structure itself must be represented in terms of a quantum regime . in the opposite extreme of the physical phenomena",
    ", gr also faces an intriguing dilemma in connection with the late cosmic speed up stage of the universe . for these reasons , and for other purely conceptual ones",
    ", gr has been the object of many extensions that have tried to provide a more satisfactory description of the gravitational field in the above mentioned extreme regimes .",
    "one of the newest extended theories of gravity is the so - called @xmath0 gravity , which is a theory formulated in a spacetime possessing absolute parallelism @xcite .",
    "we started this idea in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite by working out an ultraviolet deformation of einstein gravity .",
    "there we proposed a born - infeld - like action with the aim of smoothing singularities , namely the initial singularity of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models .",
    "the proposal was successful in replacing the initial singularity with an inflationary stage , so providing a geometrical mechanism for the exponential increasing of the scale factor without resorting to an inflaton .",
    "after that , the attention was focused in low energy deformations of einstein gravity , to tackle those aspects of the cosmological evolution connected with the late speed up stage of the universe @xcite-@xcite . quite more recently , some fundamental aspects of @xmath0 theories , like the presence of extra degrees of freedom and the lack of lorentz invariance , had been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite .    in order to gain a deep insight into these and other features of the @xmath0 approach to modified gravity , it is mandatory to enlarge the narrow number of physically relevant spacetimes hitherto considered . in section",
    "ii we explain the lack of invariance of @xmath0 theories under local lorentz transformation of the field of vierbeins in a cosmological context , and discuss about the meaning of this feature . in section iii , we work out the proper vierbein for closed and open frw cosmologies .",
    "the discussion here stressed , in spite of its conceptual character , leads to practical conclusions that will allow the comparison of the cosmological consequences coming from different ways of modified gravity .",
    "finally , in section iv we display the conclusions .",
    "the cornerstone of ( four - dimensional ) @xmath0 theories is that gravity can be described by providing the spacetime with a torsion @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a vierbein ( a basis of the cotangent space ) in a @xmath4-dimensional manifold .- like gravities are non - trivial for dimensions higher than two .",
    "the torsion tensor coming from an arbitrary _ diad _ @xmath5 in @xmath6 dimensions has only two independent components , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the tensor @xmath9 that takes part in the teleparallel lagrangian of eq . (",
    "[ weitinvar ] ) is identically null .",
    "this property , in the light of eq .",
    "( [ divergence ] ) , is consistent with the very known fact that the einstein - hilbert action in two spacetime dimensions is just the euler characteristic class of the manifold . ]",
    "the vierbein @xmath3 is the coframe of an associated basis @xmath10 in the tangent space .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the components of the 1-forms @xmath13 and the vectors @xmath14  in a given coordinate basis , then the relation between frame and coframe is expressed as @xmath15 contracting with @xmath16 one also gets @xmath17 the components @xmath18  of the torsion tensor in the coordinate basis is related to the 2-forms @xmath19 through the equation @xmath20 this means that the spacetime is endowed with a connection @xmath21 ( since @xmath22 ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ wei ] ) is the weitzenbck connection .",
    "the metric is introduced as a subsidiary field given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "( [ metric ] ) can be inverted with the help of eq .",
    "( [ coframe ] ) to obtain @xmath25 which means that the vierbein is orthonormal .",
    "the relation @xmath1 displays a remarkable analogy with the electromagnetic field : the @xmath13 s play the role of potentials and the @xmath19 s are the fields .",
    "the torsion @xmath19  is invariant under a gauge transformation @xmath26 ; the symmetric terms in the connection ( [ wei ] ) are the imprint of such gauge transformation . instead , the metric ( [ metric ] ) does not enjoy such gauge invariant meaning since it is built from the  potentials \" .",
    "teleparallelism uses the weitzenbck spacetime , where the connection is chosen as @xmath27 thus , the gauge invariance has been frozen . as a consequence of the choice of the weitzenbck connection ( [ wei1 ] ) , the riemann tensor is identically null .",
    "so the spacetime is flat : the gravitational degrees of freedom are completely encoded in the torsion @xmath1 .",
    "on other hand , the metric ( [ metric ] ) does possess invariance under local lorentz transformations : @xmath28 ; however the torsion @xmath1 transforms as @xmath29which means that the exterior derivative of the vierbein is not covariant under lorentz transformations of the vierbein , unless the lorentz transformations be _ global_. this feature could be healed by using a covariant exterior derivative to define @xmath19 ( i.e. , by introducing a spin connection ) .",
    "this procedure would restore the local lorentz freedom of the vierbein . in 4 dimensions",
    ", this local freedom would reduce the 16 components @xmath11 to only 10 physically relevant ones , but we should add the new degrees of freedom encoded in the spin connection . however , this strategy turned out to be inviable , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in terms of parallelism",
    ", the choice of the weitzenbck connection has a simple meaning .",
    "in fact , the covariant derivative of a vector yields @xmath30 in particular , eq .",
    "( [ orto ] ) implies that @xmath31 ; so , the weitzenbck connection is metric compatible .",
    "in general , eq .",
    "( [ transport ] ) means that a given vector is parallel transported along a curve if its projections on the coframe remain constant .",
    "so , the vierbein parallelizes the spacetime .",
    "of course , this nice criterion of parallelism would be destroyed if local lorentz transformations of the coframe were allowed in the theory .",
    "teleparallelism is a dynamical theory for the vierbein , which is built from the torsion @xmath1 . according to eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , a set of dynamical equations for the vierbein also implies a dynamics for the metric .",
    "this dynamics coincides with einstein s dynamics for the metric when the teleparallel lagrangian density is chosen as @xcite @xmath32=\\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\;e\\;t\\ ; , \\label{lagrangiant}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 the tensor @xmath35 appearing in the last equation is defined according to @xmath36 in fact , the lagrangian ( [ lagrangiant ] ) just differs from the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath37  in a divergence @xmath38=e\\ t-2\\;\\partial _ { \\nu } ( e\\;t_{\\sigma } ^{\\ \\ \\sigma \\nu } \\,)\\ ; ,   \\label{divergence}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the scalar curvature for the levi - civita connection . when gr dresses this costume , the gravitational degrees of freedom are gathered in the torsion instead of the levi - civita curvature .",
    "it is a very curious and fortunate fact that both pictures enable to construct a gravitational action with the same physical content .",
    "however , it is remarkable that the lagrangian ( [ lagrangiant ] ) involves just first derivatives of its dynamical field , the vierbein . in some sense",
    ", the teleparallel lagrangian picks up the essential dynamical content of einstein theory without the annoying second order derivatives appearing in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ divergence ] ) .",
    "such lagrangian is a better starting point for considering modified gravity theories , since any deformation of its dependence on @xmath40 will always lead to second order dynamical equations . on the contrary ,",
    "the so - called @xmath41 theories lead to fourth order equations .",
    "the teleparallel lagrangian ( [ lagrangiant ] ) can be rephrased in geometrical language . since @xmath35 is antisymmetric in @xmath42 ,",
    "then @xmath43 is a set of four 2-forms @xmath44 . noticing that @xmath45then we have@xmath46where @xmath47 stands for the 1-form whose components are @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the teleparallel lagrangian density can be written as @xmath32=\\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\;\\eta _ { ab}\\ s^{a}\\wedge\\ , ^{\\ast}t^{b}\\ ; ,   \\label{lagrangiant2}\\]]where @xmath49 is the hodge star operator .",
    "analogously to the @xmath41 scheme , a @xmath0 theory replaces the weitzenbck invariant @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangiant ] ) with a general function @xmath0 .",
    "so , the dynamics is described by the action @xmath51where @xmath52 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "undoubtedly , the whole family of actions gathered in ( [ action ] ) constitutes a vast territory worth to be explored , specially when one is aware that the dynamical equations arising by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the vierbein components @xmath53 are of second order .",
    "this distinctive feature makes weitzenbck spacetime a privileged geometric structure to formulate modified theories of gravitation .",
    "in fact , the dynamical equations for the vierbein are @xmath54 where @xmath55 refers to the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath56 , and the primes denote differentiation respect to @xmath40 . these equations tell how the matter distribution organizes the orientation of the vierbein @xmath13 at each point , in such a way that the field lines of @xmath57 realize the parallelization of the manifold .",
    "after this vierbein field is obtained , one uses the assumption of orthonormality to get the metric ( [ metric ] ) . instead ,",
    "gr is a theory for the metric ; so it is invariant under local lorentz transformations of the vierbein .",
    "the equivalence between teleparallelism ( [ lagrangiant ] ) and gr dynamics , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ divergence ] ) , implies that @xmath40 changes by a boundary term under local lorentz transformations .",
    "because of this reason , the teleparallel equivalent of gr does not provide the manifold with a parallelization but only with a metric . on the contrary , in a @xmath0 theory the boundary term \" in @xmath40",
    "will remain encapsulated inside the function @xmath58 .",
    "this means that a @xmath0 theory is not invariant under local lorentz transformations of the vierbein .",
    "so , a @xmath0 theory will determinate the vierbein field almost completely ( up to global lorentz transformations ) . in other words ,",
    "a @xmath0 theory will describe more degrees of freedom than the teleparallel equivalent of gr .",
    "this is an important issue in the search for solutions to the @xmath0 dynamical equations , since every two pair of vierbeins connected by a local lorentz transformation ( i.e. leading to the same metric tensor ) are _ inequivalent _ from the point of view of the theory .",
    "we will address this topic in the next section by considering the vierbeins that are suitable for closed and open frw universes .",
    "so far , the totality of the works alluding to @xmath0 theories in cosmological spacetimes deals with spatially flat frw cosmologies .",
    "this is not only because this geometry seems to be the more appropriate for the description of the large scale structure of the universe , but also for technical reasons .",
    "in fact , one could think that the starring field the vierbein @xmath3 , related to the metric @xmath59 via @xmath60  is the naive square root of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in a spatially flat frw universe described by the line element @xmath61 one would replace in eqs .",
    "( [ dynamics ] ) the diagonal vierbein @xmath62this is really a good guess because the eqs .",
    "( [ dynamics ] ) become a set of consistent dynamical equations for the scale factor @xmath63 . moreover , the weitzenbck invariant for @xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hubble parameter . additionally , it is easy to check that the field equations ( [ dynamics ] ) for the vierbein ( [ tetplana ] ) can be also obtained from a ( minisuperspace ) reduced action constructed by replacing this specific form of the weitzenbck invariant in the general action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to trace back the geometrical meaning of the diagonal vierbein ( [ tetplana ] ) .",
    "actually , the autoparallel curves of flat euclidean space are given by straight lines , which can be generated by the coordinate basis @xmath67 , whose dual co - basis is just @xmath68 .",
    "then , modulo a time - dependent conformal factor , the frames describing the autoparallel lines are just @xmath68 , as eq .",
    "( [ tetplana ] ) shows .",
    "however , things  are not so easy in the context of closed and open frw universes , whose line element can be described in hyper - spherical coordinates as @xmath69 ,   \\label{metesferica}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 for the closed universe and @xmath71 for the open universe . here , one is also tempted to think that the vierbein that solves the dynamical equations ( [ dynamics ] ) could have the form @xmath72 in the teleparallel equivalent of gr , any choice of the vierbein reproducing the metric is valid because of the local lorentz symmetry . on the contrary , the lack of this local invariance , which is inherent to @xmath0 theories , makes this naive choice to be incompatible with the dynamical equations ( [ dynamics ] ) .",
    "in other words , the vierbein ( [ naive ] ) does not correctly parallelize the spacetime .",
    "the symptom that the choice ( [ naive ] ) will not work is the form acquired by the weitzenbck invariant in such case , which turn out to be @xmath73.\\ ] ] this form of @xmath40 would be unable of giving a proper reduced lagrangian for the dynamics of the scale factor @xmath63 , as a consequence of its dependence on @xmath74 .",
    "this @xmath75-dependent weitzenbck invariant is not consistent with the isotropy and homogeneity of the frw cosmological models .",
    "let us discuss in detail the closed universe ( @xmath70 ) with topology @xmath76 . in order to parallelize the @xmath77 sphere ,",
    "let us consider @xmath77 as embedded in a 4-dimensional euclidean space with cartesian coordinates @xmath78 , so @xmath79at each point of the sphere there exists a cartesian ( canonical ) orthonormal coframe basis of the host euclidean space , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 stands for @xmath78 .",
    "we will rotate this coframe in such a way that one of the resulting covectors be normal to the @xmath77 sphere , being the other three covectors automatically tangent to @xmath77 .",
    "this tangent vierbein will prove to be the proper spatial part of the vierbein for the closed frw cosmology , in the sense that it will lead to consistent dynamical equations for the scale factor of the closed universe .",
    "so , let us introduce a smooth coframe field @xmath82 on the @xmath77 sphere by rotating the canonical frame @xmath83 , i.e , @xmath84it is not difficult to verify that the matrix @xmath85 constitute a local rotation on the sphere ( it fulfills @xmath86 , and @xmath87 on the @xmath77 sphere ( [ sumcua ] ) ) . then",

    "this is so because the theory is invariant under the local lorentz group acting on the coframes @xmath117 . in turn , when @xmath122 , local lorentz rotations and boosts are not symmetries of the theory anymore .",
