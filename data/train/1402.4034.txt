    "<S> the transition between topological trivial and nontrivial states can be easily controlled by shaking frequency and amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> our schemes have two major advantages . </S>",
    "<S> first , both the static hamiltonian and the shaking scheme are sufficiently simple to implement . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it requires relatively small shaking amplitude and therefore heating can be minimized . </S>",
    "<S> these two advantages make our scheme much more practical .    </S>",
    "<S> topological state of matters such as quantum hall effect and topological insulator have been extensively studied in equilibrium systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently , topological classification of quantum states in a periodically driven non - equilibrium system has been proposed @xcite , in which the topologically nontrivial states are named as floquet topological insulator \" @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> floquet topological band has been first realized in photonic crystal and the edge state of light has been observed @xcite . while so far it has not been realized in any solid - state or cold - atom system .    </S>",
    "<S> realizing and studying topological state of matter is also one of the major treads for cold atom physics nowadays , for which raman laser coupling bloch , spielman , bloch2013,ketterle2013 and shaking optical lattice sengstock1,sengstock2 , cheng have been developed as two major schemes . </S>",
    "<S> in several recent experiments , it has been demonstrated that fast shaking optical lattices can generate synthetic abelian gauge field and magnetic flux @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose that shaking optical lattice is also a powerful tool to realize floquet topological state in cold atom systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we first demonstrate that in one - dimension lattice it realizes a system equivalent to su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite with nonzero zak phase ; then , we show that in two - dimension honeycomb lattice @xcite it realizes a system equivalent to the haldane model which exhibits quantum anomalous hall effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , quantum anomalous hall effect has only been found in chromium - doped @xmath0 , and growing this material is extremely challenging @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore highly desirable that one can quantum simulate this effect with cold atom system . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite of several proposals @xcite this effect has not yet been successfully simulated in cold atom setup . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme has two major advantages for which it becomes much practical .    </S>",
    "<S> the first is its simplicity . to realize a topological state in a static system </S>",
    "<S> , it usually requires particular form of hopping term . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in order to realize the haldane model @xcite , one needs to generate a special next - nearest range hopping term , which usually requires engineering laser - assisted tunneling in cold atom system bloch , spielman , bloch2013,ketterle2013 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in our scheme , the static hamiltonian is quite simple ( it only contains normal nearest neighboring hopping without extra phase factor ) and has been realized in different laboratories already . </S>",
    "<S> the beauty of this scheme is that such a simple static hamiltonian can result in a topological nontrivial state when a proper shaking term is turn on , and such a shaking can also be very easily implemented by time - periodically modulating the relative phase of two counter - propagating laser beams .    </S>",
    "<S> the second is minimizing heating . in our proposals </S>",
    "<S> , it only demands quite small shaking amplitude in order to reach topological phase , and consequently heating is minimized . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our proposals are inspired by recent experiment in chicago group , in which @xmath1-band and @xmath2-band of a one - dimensional optical lattice is resonantly coupled by shaking . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the band dispersion can be qualitatively changed even with small shaking amplitude and the accompanying heating is insignificant @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ general method . _ </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical treatment of shaking optical lattices is based on the floquet theory . for a periodical driven hamiltonian @xmath3 with period @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , its floquet operator can be defined as @xmath5where @xmath6 denotes time - order , and @xmath7 is the initial time . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalue and eigenstates of @xmath8 is given by @xmath9where @xmath10 is the quasi - energy . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we shall use two different methods listed below to show how simple shaking schemes can result in nontrivial topology in optical lattice systems , because each method has its own advantage .    </S>",
    "<S> * method i. * we can numerically evaluate floquet operator @xmath8 according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ floquet_operator ] and determine its eigenvalues and eigen - wave - functions from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eigen ] . </S>",
    "<S> if a periodically driven system exhibits nontrivial topological , there must be in - gap quasi - energies @xmath11 and their corresponding wave functions @xmath12 are spatially well localized at the edge of the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this method is that once @xmath3 is given , it is free from any further approximations </S>",
    "<S> .        * method ii . </S>",
    "<S> * we can introduce a time - independent effective hamiltonian @xmath13 via @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> expanding @xmath3 as @xmath15 with @xmath16 , we consider a situation as shown in fig.[fig1](a ) , that is , the static component @xmath17 contains @xmath18-bands within an energy range of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the two concrete examples discussed later either belong to this situation or can be transferred into this situation by a rotating wave transformation , with @xmath21 . under this condition , it is straightforward to show that to the leading order of @xmath22 , @xmath13 can be deduced as @xmath23 } { n\\omega } -\\frac{\\left [ \\hat{h}_{n},% \\hat{h}_{0}\\right ] } { e^{-2\\pi i\\alpha } n\\omega } + \\frac{\\left [ \\hat{h}_{-n},% \\hat{h}_{0}\\right ] } { e^{2\\pi i\\alpha } n\\omega } \\right\\ } ,   \\label{heff}\\]]where @xmath7 is taken as @xmath24 with @xmath25 . since @xmath8 with different choices of initial time @xmath7 relate to each other by a unitary transformation , quasi - energy is independent of the choice of @xmath7 . practically , we can choose an optimal @xmath26 that simplifies @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> . then we can apply schemes developed for a time - independent hamiltonian to classify topology of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> although this method involves further approximations , it has the advantage that it is physically more transparent and can bring out the connection to topological phenomena in equilibrium systems .    </S>",

    "<S> _ a one - dimensional lattice is formed by two counter - propagating lasers . </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian acquires a time - dependent vector potential term as @xmath33the first two static terms give a static band structure with bloch wave function @xmath34 . in this bases , by only keeping @xmath1- and @xmath2-band ( for the reason which will be clear later ) , we can write down a tight - binding hamiltonian as @xmath35where @xmath36 are creation operators for @xmath1- and @xmath2-orbitals . and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the onsite energy , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the hopping amplitude from the static part . </S>",
