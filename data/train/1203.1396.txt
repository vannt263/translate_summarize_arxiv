    "@xcite are also shown .",
    "the latter experimental data is summarized in table [ table - experiment - clanet - searby ] for two experimental runs for neutrally stable ( @xmath2 ) low-@xmath3 , propane - air mixture with @xmath4 , and axisymmetric geometry of the tube .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma - ma - planar - compare ] that the scaled acceleration rate @xmath1 obtained in the present experiments for the high-@xmath3 @xmath5 stoichiometric mixture in a channel with a quadratic cross - section are considerably closer to the planar case than the axisymmetric one .",
    "thus , although the flame tip has the hemispherical shape , the global flame front acceleration is governed by the quadratic cross section of the channel and can be described by the theory of section [ sec.2d.incompressible ] . at the same time ,",
    "values of @xmath1 of table [ table - experiment - clanet - searby ] @xcite for low-@xmath3 , propane - air mixtures are close to the incompressible value @xmath6 for the axisymmetric case , in agreement with the present theory .",
    "it is known that flame acceleration in ddt sensitively depends on flame confinement and the channel geometry @xcite .",
    "the present numerical simulation and experimental results indicate that the geometry of the tube affects the growth rate of finger flame acceleration significantly , with the axisymmetric tube being favorable for faster flame acceleration due to the finger flame mechanism .    .",
    "values of @xmath7 obtained from numerical simulations are shown by circles for axisymmetric geometry and by squares for planar geometry .",

    "we conclude the present extensive investigation by noting that pressure jump at the flame front could potentially induce a gas velocity of @xmath8 , and as such the pressure field could play an essential role in the present phenomena of interest @xcite . here",
    "we recognize that the present theoretical results are obtained by considering only two ( quasi - planar ) parts of the flame : 1 ) flame skirt near the closed tube end , and 2 ) flame tip in the vicinity of channel axis . due to the exponential acceleration of the flame tip ,",
    "the entire process of finger flame propagation occurs rapidly .",
    "for example , for @xmath0 the characteristic non - dimensional time of reaching the maximum flame tip velocity in planar geometry is @xmath9 . by that instant",
    "the flame tip has shifted to the non - dimensional position @xmath10 .",
    "if we assume that the pressure field induces flame velocity of the order of @xmath11 at the curved parts of the flame ( i.e. not at the skirt and the flame tip ) , then at the end of the finger flame evolution the additional displacement of the curved elements of the flame would be of the order of @xmath12 ( in nondimensional units ) , i.e. considerably smaller than the flame tip displacement @xmath10 . due to the elongated flame shape resulting from the exponential flame tip acceleration",
    ", the motion of the curved parts of the flame front does not considerably influence the flame acceleration .",
    "consequently , pressure field variation has only minimal influence on the present theory .",
    "it is also noted that since our problem is evolutionary ( non - steady ) , the maximum flame tip velocity could be more than two orders of magnitude higher than @xmath11 , hence implying that the low - mach limit is not applicable , and the pressure field can not be considered steady as , for example , in bunsen flame problem @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",

    "the compressibility effect renders the dl instability much stronger in both linear and nonlinear stages , while in the case of finger flame acceleration compressibility moderates flame acceleration in tubes considerably .",
    "the theory , experiments and numerical simulations of the present work show that the growth rate @xmath19 of the finger - flame acceleration from the closed end of a channel / tube decreases significantly with increasing initial mach number , @xmath3 .",
    "hence , previous theoretical estimates of @xcite , derived with the incompressible approximation , overestimate @xmath19 for flames with high laminar burning velocities , such as the @xmath5 or acetylene / air flames . in the present study , we account for gas compression through expansion for small mach number up to first - order terms , and validate the theoretical analysis by numerical simulations and experiment . the present numerical simulation and theory show that the maximum flame tip velocity significantly depends on @xmath3 , with the scaled time of the maximum flame tip velocity being almost independent of it .",
    "the present results collectively demonstrate that the geometry of the channel affects the growth rate of the finger flame significantly , with the axisymmetric channel being more conducive for fast initial flame acceleration from the closed end in channels with smooth walls .",
    "it is emphasized that compressibility effects should be taken into account when estimating the strength of shock waves generated by the initial finger - type flame acceleration , pre - heating of the unburnt fuel mixture ahead of the flame , the ddt onset time and position .",
