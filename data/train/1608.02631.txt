    "white dwarfs are the final evolutionary stage of stars with masses less than @xmath1 , though the upper mass limit is not yet well known @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite attempted to provide observational limits on the maximum progenitor mass .",
    "most white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen , but those with masses less than @xmath2 are made of helium , while those more massive than @xmath3 are made of oxygen and neon @xcite .",
    "the exact composition of the carbon - oxygen core critically depends on the processes occuring during the previous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "theoretical calculations show that the precise ratio of carbon to oxygen depends , to a large extent , on the competition between the and the triple-@xmath4 reactions @xcite , on the particular details of the stellar evolutionary codes used to compute the pre - white dwarf evolutionary phases @xcite , on the adopted convective prescription and on the choice of several other physical inputs @xcite . in a typical white dwarf of @xmath5 , oxygen represents 62% of the total mass , while its concentration in the central layers of the white dwarf can be as high as 85% @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the core is surrounded by a thin layer of pure helium with a mass ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "masses larger than @xmath8 are not possible , as this would lead to helium ignition at the base of the shell .",
    "this region is , in turn , surrounded by an even thinner layer of hydrogen with mass within the range @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "this layer is missing in @xmath11 of white dwarfs , and determines the basic chemical composition of their envelopes .    from a phenomenological point of view , white dwarfs with hydrogen spectral lines are classified as da .",
    "the rest are classified as do , db , dq , dz and dc , depending on their spectral features , roughly constituting a sequence of decreasing temperatures @xcite , and have helium - dominated atmospheres .",
    "it is well established that white dwarfs with helium - rich atmospheres are the result of a late shell flash , and that the subsequent evolution results in distinct atmospheric features . for instance , a dredge - up episode is at the origin of dq white dwarfs , while dz white dwarfs are the result of external pollution by metals .",
    "do and db white dwarfs have surface layers which are made of almost pure helium , only differing in effective temperature , which determines the corresponding spectral features , while dc white dwarfs are characterized by the absence of helium spectral lines at low temperatures .",
    "although our basic understanding of the physical mechanisms that lead to the formation of the different white dwarf spectral types is on solid grounds , several details still need to be studied , as there is an interplay between the mechanisms operating in the envelopes of white dwarfs , such as gravitational settling , thermal diffusion , radiative levitation , convection at the h - he and he - core interfaces , proton burning , stellar winds and mass accretion from the interstellar medium .",
    "these interesting topics are , however , out of the scope of our paper  a good summary can be found in @xcite . most of the observational efforts to empirically determine the white dwarf luminosity function have been done employing samples of da white dwarfs .",
    "for this reason we will focus primarily on work done on these types of white dwarfs .",
    "white dwarfs have rather simple mechanical structures .",
    "in fact , their stability is mostly provided by the pressure of degenerate electrons and to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium  that is , to balance gravity with the pressure gradient  the energy release of thermonuclear reactions is not needed .",
    "because of this , their evolution can be described as a simple cooling process @xcite in which the internal degenerate core acts as a reservoir of energy and the outer non - degenerate layers modulate the energy outflow . in the simplest picture it is assumed that the core is isothermal , which is justified by the high conductivity of degenerate electrons and the thin envelope . under these conditions",
    "energy conservation may be written as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the thermal content , @xmath14 is the average specific heat , @xmath15 is the temperature of the nearly isothermal core , and @xmath16 is the mass of the white dwarf . additionally , the luminosity of the star and the temperature of the isothermal core are , to first order , related through the expression :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a function which depends on the detailed thermal structure of the envelope .",
    "this set of equations can be integrated , provided that @xmath18 is given .",
    "a simple calculation indicates that the cooling timescales of these stars are very long , @xmath0  gyr , and thus the white dwarf population largely remains visible throughout the cooling process and retains important information about the past history of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , this allows us to derive useful constraints on the stellar formation rate @xcite and the age @xcite of the different galactic components : disk , halo as well as open clusters and globular clusters .",
    "moreover , it has been conjectured that those white dwarfs that are not detectable could contribute substantially to the dark matter content of our galaxy .",
    "specifically , surveys carried out by the macho team @xcite suggested that a substantial fraction of the halo dark matter could be in the form of very cool white dwarfs . since then , the eros @xcite , ogle @xcite , moa @xcite and supermacho @xcite teams have monitored millions of stars during several years in both the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) to search for microlensing events .",
    "most of them have challenged the results of the macho experiment  see , for instance , @xcite and references therein .",
    "in addition , there have been several claims that white dwarfs could be the stellar objects reported in the hubble deep field @xcite",
    ". however , these claims remain inconclusive for lack of spectroscopic identifications and confirmed proper motions . the hubble deep field  south has provided another opportunity to test the contribution of white dwarfs to the galactic dark matter content . in particular , three white dwarf candidates among several faint blue objects which exhibit significant proper motion have been found @xcite .",
    "they are assumed to belong to the thick disk or halo populations .",
    "if these are spectroscopically confirmed , it would imply that white dwarfs account for @xmath19 of the galactic dark matter , which would fit comfortably within the results of the eros team .",
    "all in all , the study of the white dwarf population has important ramifications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of the milky way .",
    "the fundamental tool for studying the properties of the white dwarf population is the white dwarf luminosity function , which is defined as the number of white dwarfs per cubic parsec as a function of unit luminosity .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function not only can provide valuable information about the age , structure and evolution of our galaxy but it also provides an independent test of the theory of dense plasmas @xcite .",
    "also , it directly constrains the current death rate of low- and intermediate - mass stars in the local neighborhood which , in turn , provides an important constraint on pre - white dwarf stellar evolutionary sequences .",
    "however , in order to use the white dwarf luminosity function to study these interesting astrophysical problems , it is necessary to have good observational data , accurate stellar models , and reliable prescriptions to model the population components of our galaxy . in this paper",
    "we review the current knowledge of the white dwarf luminosity function , from both the observational and theoretical points of view .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ past ] reviews the observational efforts , while in sect .",
    "[ theory ] we provide an overview of the theoretical models .",
    "it is followed by sect .",
    "[ cooling ] , where we discuss the current state of the art of the white dwarf cooling theory , paying special attention to the most relevant evolutionary phases . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will not review in detail the abundant theoretical background , but only those salient features of the theory needed to model the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for detailed discussions on topics such as the so - called convective coupling or spectral evolution . in sect .",
    "[ inputs ] we discuss other important inputs necessary to model the white dwarf luminosity function . in sect .",
    "[ applications ] we elaborate on a few of the many astrophysical applications of the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "section  [ future ] outlines the foreseeable future research in the field from both the theoretical and observational points of view .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ space ] summarizes in a comprehensive way the most relevant observational results previously analyzed in sect .",
    "[ past ] , and lists the ages of the galactic disk derived from the observed luminosity functions .",
    "we conclude with a general summary , which is presented in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .    before going into details we would like to stress that the selection of papers for explicit citation may be somewhat incomplete , as the field is rapidly evolving , and moreover it is the product of the special research trajectory of the authors .",
    "we apologize in advance for any unintentionally missed references .",
    "over fifty years ago it was first recognized that the coolest ( faintest ) white dwarfs are remnants of the earliest stars to form in the solar neighborhood @xcite , and that cooling theory could be used to estimate the time elapsed since star formation commenced in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "three decades later , the white dwarf luminosity function helped resolve serious discrepancies between the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxy and the age of the universe implied by the hubble recession rate of galaxies @xcite .",
    "following on the heels of these pioneering works , several other investigations began to use white dwarfs as reliable cosmochronometers to determine ages of individual stars , binaries and stellar clusters  see @xcite for an excellent review of this topic .",
    "the observed white dwarf luminosity function preserves a record of the star formation and death rate that spans the history of the galaxy , sets constraints on the quantity of its local baryonic matter , the recycling of material to the interstellar medium , and encodes the kinematics of stellar populations throughout the disk and halo .",
    "its uses and inherent limitations have been discussed in a number of excellent papers @xcite , while several reviews of the theory behind the white dwarf luminosity function provided essential caveats and context for its interpretation @xcite .",
    "those new to the topic of the white dwarf luminosity function would do well to start with the above references as background . here",
    "we focus on a few key developments leading to the present state of the empirical white dwarf luminosity function and what can be expected in the near future .",
    "a comprehensive summary of all relevant work is well beyond the scope of this review .",
    "we apologize in advance if a particular project of interest has been omitted .",
    "however , each of the works cited below contains an abundance of references and comparisons , details on the methods employed and , especially , the myriad pitfalls associated with constructing an empirical luminosity function for white dwarfs .    any observational study of the white dwarf luminosity function must begin with a well - defined sample . in the work summarized below",
    ", three basic approaches have been used .",
    "one is to identify a magnitude - limited sample using color index selection criteria to isolate the most likely white dwarf candidates .",
    "another approach is to use proper motions and color indices to isolate nearby white dwarf candidates by their intrinsic low luminosity , color and high proper motion .",
    "such samples usually require a weighting scheme to correct for the kinematic bias that causes fast - moving distant and slow - moving nearby objects to be undercounted . the best approach is to do straightforward counts in a large volume - limited sample that is demonstrably complete .",
    "unfortunately , this is rarely possible due to the low luminosity of white dwarfs , confusion of the cooler ones with lower main sequence stars and sub - dwarfs , the lack of spectra for many objects , and the lack of precision trigonometric parallaxes .    in the works described below all three of these approaches",
    "have been used .",
    "the discussion is arbitrarily organized into five parts and presented in rough chronological order within each part .",
    "section  [ hot ] outlines several key attempts to quantify the more accessible hot ( bright ) end of the white dwarf luminosity function , which constrains the current white dwarf formation rate .",
    "section  [ early ] provides an overview of early ( pre-2000 ) efforts to construct the full white dwarf luminosity function from local samples of white dwarfs .",
    "section  [ disk ] describes more recent progress towards a definitive luminosity function for the local white dwarf sample .",
    "this work has tended to take two approaches : construction of complete nearby samples of white dwarfs that are effectively limited to the thin disk and searches within large modern surveys that include white dwarfs from a mix of populations ( thin disk , thick disk , halo ) .",
    "section  [ halo ] describes very preliminary attempts to construct the luminosity function specifically for the halo ( spheroidal ) population of white dwarfs .",
    "section  [ prospects ] provides some concluding remarks on key issues that still need to be addressed , as well as prospects for improving the observed white dwarf luminosity function in the near future .",
    "the hot da white dwarfs in the palomar - green ( pg ) survey @xcite comprise a magnitude - limited sample originally selected primarily on the basis of blue color criteria .",
    "this sample was used to anchor the hot end of one of the first estimates of the full white dwarf luminosity function @xcite discussed below .",
    "the pg sample of hot white dwarfs , i.e. , those brighter than @xmath20 , was analyzed by @xcite using high signal - to - noise spectra and improved atmosphere model fits to the balmer lines to derive temperatures , gravities , masses , radii and cooling ages .",
    "their luminosity function , corrected for incompleteness and weighted by the @xmath21 method @xcite indicated that hot white dwarfs comprise about ten percent of the white dwarf space density .",
    "this careful study is most noteworthy for its examination of apparent structure in the white dwarf mass distribution and for one of the first robust determinations of the formation rate of white dwarfs with hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "the latter constrains the formation rate and space density of planetary nebulae and , consequently , stellar evolutionary models for progenitors less than about ten solar masses .",
    "the kiso schmidt survey of uv - excess objects @xcite also proved to be a rich source of hot white dwarfs . using this magnitude- and color - limited sample , supplemented by their own spectroscopic identifications",
    ", @xcite published one of the first white dwarf luminosity functions based on this survey .",
    "their luminosity function and space density of hot white dwarfs were found to agree well with that derived from the pg sample .    in a preliminary analysis of the anglo - australian telescope 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) data , @xcite identified @xmath22 white dwarf candidates at distances up to 1  kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "the main thrust of this work was to measure both the scale height and luminosity function for hot white dwarfs .",
    "a white dwarf luminosity function was presented for stars brighter than @xmath23 .",
    "it matches the early white dwarf luminosity function of @xcite and has a similar scale height ( 200-300  pc ) .",
    "notably , the 2qf sample appears to be complete at the bright end , i.e. , for @xmath24 .",
    "the hot end of the white dwarf luminosity function was evaluated using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr4 data by @xcite .",
    "this well - calibrated large sample included almost 6,000 stars .",
    "it enabled a thorough examination of incompleteness and other systematic effects , though they did not attempt to derive a disk age or space density .",
    "they also identified a plateau between @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite found that this plateau could not be the result of a sudden change in the white dwarf birth rate because it would also be visible in the luminosity function of helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "once stars with masses smaller than the canonical limit for the formation of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf were removed from the observational sample the agreement between theory and observation was nearly perfect @xcite .",
    "the da / non - da ratio as a function of luminosity is an important constraint on the evolutionary channels that govern the atmosphere transformations and chemical composition changes as the hottest white dwarfs cool .",
    "however , hot white dwarfs are quite rare and this leads to large errors in the observed da / non - da ratio at the hot end of the luminosity function .",
    "spectral features tend to be weak or absent in cooler white dwarfs , making this ratio difficult to determine , underscoring the importance of the hot white dwarf luminosity function as a fundamental constraint on the spectroscopic evolution of cooling white dwarfs that influences the entire luminosity function .",
    "however , temperatures for some of the hot da white dwarfs can be overestimated due to unknown atmospheric metal abundances ; shifting them to lower luminosity bins changes the shape of the hot white dwarf luminosity function and the da / non - da ratio .",
    "@xcite presented an analysis of the hot da and db white dwarfs in the kiso schmidt survey , using detailed model atmosphere fits to the optical spectroscopic data .",
    "the resulting @xmath26 values were compared with the original estimates of @xcite , which were obtained from empirical photometric calibrations .",
    "@xcite found the two approaches ( spectra and photometry ) had a relatively small impact on the calculated luminosity functions .",
    "they also determined separate luminosity functions for da and db stars and placed a smaller number of stars in the fainter magnitude bins than @xcite .",
    "the luminosity functions , space densities and completeness determinations they obtained from the kiso sample were found to be quite consistent with those published by @xcite for the pg survey , establishing the hot end of the observed white dwarf luminosity function as a reliable constraint on deeper investigations .",
    "of particular note , however , @xcite discovered several unresolved double - degenerate binaries in the sample , raising the possibility that other undetected pairs have affected estimates of the space density of white dwarf stars in studies that do not use detailed atmospheric model fits to spectra .",
    "@xcite noted that removing low mass white dwarfs from their sample increases the da / non - da ratio at high effective temperatures as well as in the range known formerly as the db gap .",
    "he suggested that a new sdss white dwarf catalog from a later data release could provide a large enough basis to begin to address these problems .    in summary ,",
    "because it fully incorporates new theoretical models for white dwarf atmospheres , cooling , completeness , biases and selection effects , the work outlined above  see additional references in @xcite  can be regarded as the most definitive determination of the hot white dwarf luminosity function at the moment .",
    "the pg and kiso surveys continue to be valuable touchstones for evaluating selection effects and completeness of newer samples of hot white dwarfs .",
    "indeed , these white dwarfs are often embedded in the larger newer studies .",
    "current samples are now so large that it is no longer observationally necessary to consider the hot end of the white dwarf luminosity function as a separate project .",
    "the following sections outline attempts to fully determine the white dwarf luminosity function to and beyond an expected downturn in space density at @xmath27 .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first attempt to construct an observational white dwarf luminosity function was made in the late sixties @xcite . using three datasets @xcite",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that all closely followed the expected cooling theory @xcite .",
    "assuming an age of 10  gyr for the galaxy , it was estimated that white dwarfs as faint as @xmath28 should have been found . at that time , none fainter than @xmath29 were known . in hindsight",
    ", it was the low quantum efficiency of photographic plates and early electronic detectors that frustrated early searches for faint ( cool ) white dwarfs  see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many of the early white dwarf luminosity functions were constructed from luyten s landmark proper motion surveys @xcite .",
    "luyten used second - epoch red plates taken about a decade after the original palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - i ) to measure proper motions , photographic magnitudes , and crude color classes for stars down to the plate limit near @xmath30 for roughly two - thirds of the sky . with these data he identified candidate white dwarfs using so - called reduced proper motion diagrams , a technique for isolating stellar populations he pioneered @xcite",
    " see @xcite for an early assessment of this technique .",
    "later , with new high quantum efficiency instrumentation this sample proved to contain many of the previously `` missing '' cool faint white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "over thirty years ago , it was pointed out by @xcite that the observed scarcity of white dwarfs of very low luminosity could be due to either large errors in the cooling theory , or to the finite age of the galaxy .",
    "this idea was first tested by @xcite . using a sample of",
    "43 spectroscopically identified white dwarfs with trigonometric parallax data they concluded that the absence of stars in the lowest luminosity bin was statistically significant . expanding on this idea , the luyten half - second catalog @xcite  a subset of luyten s poss - i proper motion survey ",
    "was used for a more detailed analysis of the white dwarf luminosity function by @xcite . a sample of mostly cool white dwarfs with @xmath31  sec  yr@xmath32 and @xmath33 was selected to better distinguish nearby low luminosity white dwarfs from high velocity background stars .",
    "to maximize completeness , hot white dwarfs were added from the color - selected pg sample of @xcite .",
    "there was initial concern that the @xcite sample was not complete , especially at the critical faint end that constrains the age of the galaxy @xcite . in a more complete sample , the position of the downturn would move to fainter magnitudes and hence the galactic age determination would increase .",
    "however , many of the fields were re - examined by @xcite using new poss - ii plates and it was concluded that the lhs sample is roughly 90 percent complete over the magnitude and proper motion limits used in @xcite , when the scale height of the galaxy is taken into account .",
    "this sample provided the first reliable estimate for the local mass density of white dwarfs and a minimum age for the galactic disk of @xmath34  gyr .",
    "the luyten poss - i survey was also used by @xcite , but with a different approach . a large sample of wide binaries containing spectroscopically identified white dwarfs with much fainter magnitudes and much smaller proper motions were selected .",
    "this permitted the sample to be as deep as possible and also to include any nearby slow moving white dwarfs that would have been overlooked by @xcite .",
    "corrections for incompleteness in the sample were made by constructing star counts vs. both magnitude bin and proper motion bin .",
    "@xmath35 photometry was used to estimate the white dwarf luminosities by interpolating within the grids of hydrogen - rich and helium - rich atmosphere cooling models by @xcite . the model chosen to determine the luminosity for each of the @xmath36 stars in the sample",
    "was determined by the dominant constituent seen in its spectrum .",
    "a mass of @xmath37 was assumed for stars without independent mass determinations . the uncertainty in composition and the empirical dispersion in the white dwarf mass distribution published by @xcite were included in the error analysis .",
    "this study revealed that the downturn was less steep than found by @xcite , implying a somewhat older minimum age of @xmath38  gyr for the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite obtained optical and infrared data for the sample of @xcite . using model atmospheres by @xcite and new trigonometric parallaxes",
    ", they recomputed the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "the result yielded only slight differences in the shape and a modest increase in disk age from @xcite .",
    "incorporation of improved trigonometric parallaxes ( the dominant uncertainty in luminosity estimates ) and additional leverage on atmospheric composition provided by the infrared data for the cooler objects , made the @xcite a more definitive determination of the white dwarf luminosity function than prior work .",
    "@xcite constructed one of the first white dwarf luminosity functions not based on the luyten proper motion survey .",
    "digital scans of @xmath39 supercosmos eso / serc plates were used to identify white dwarf candidates via reduced proper motion diagrams .",
    "both the proper motion and photographic color estimates were much improved over what luyten could do with the poss plates .",
    "more importantly , a special effort was made to assess the incompleteness of the sample of 58 white dwarf candidates that were identified .",
    "it is one of very few samples shown to pass the @xmath40 completeness test @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere models of @xcite were used to estimate the white dwarf candidates luminosities .",
    "the magnitude and proper motion limits of this survey significantly exceeded that of @xcite , enabling the detection of intrinsically fainter stars .",
    "the downturn at the faint end of the white dwarf luminosity function was found to be more gradual than most earlier surveys , implying a minimum disk age of @xmath41  gyr , in accord with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function was re - evaluated by @xcite and summarized by @xcite using much - improved photometric and spectroscopic data for a sample of luyten white dwarfs in wide binaries more than three times larger than used in @xcite . using the same incompleteness correction strategy and the @xmath42 methodology , the revised luminosity function , space density and disk age were unchanged .",
    "however , the larger sample improved the precision of each by about a factor of two .",
    "the above studies marked important stepping stones towards a definitive white dwarf luminosity function . because of its tie to good trigonometric parallaxes and careful fitting of atmospheric models to the white dwarf spectral energy distributions , the luminostiy function of @xcite probably is the best early benchmark .",
    "however , the work by @xcite and @xcite convincingly demonstrated that deeper surveys were needed to delineate the faint end of the white dwarf luminosity function that constrains the age of the galaxy and to identifying the fraction of each bin contributed by its halo components .",
    "these issues spurred the more recent work using large modern surveys , which are addressed in the next two sections .",
    "newer work on the white dwarf luminosity function has tended to focus on obtaining `` quality '' , i.e. well - vetted complete samples of nearby white dwarfs drawn from a variety of sources , or `` quantity '' , i.e. large samples of white dwarfs gleaned from huge surveys with well - quantified completeness characteristics .",
    "we begin this section with some examples of the first type .    only within the last decade or so",
    "has the census of nearby white dwarfs grown large enough to seriously pursue the best way to determine a luminosity function : direct star counts by volume .",
    "@xcite used the catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs @xcite to identify a sample of well over 100 white dwarfs with high quality spectra , photometry , proper motions and parallaxes likely to be within 20  pc of the sun .",
    "their subset of 44 white dwarfs within 13  pc of the sun was shown to be essentially complete and the 20  pc sample as a whole was shown to be almost 80 percent complete .",
    "thus , simple star counts could be used to derive the space density .",
    "this avoids the necessity of using the @xmath42 method or more sophisticated statistical methods , all of which are susceptible to small number fluctuations , observational biases , and/or unproven completeness  see @xcite for a discussion of these problems .",
    "the kinematical properties , spectroscopic subtypes and stellar population subcomponents of the 20  pc local white dwarf sample were evaluated by @xcite .",
    "virtually the entire sample was found to belong to the thin disk component of the galaxy .",
    "this local sample contained not a single interloping member of the halo .",
    "@xcite confirmed these results in an expanded sample of over 200 white dwarfs within 25  pc .",
    "the completeness s of these samples were shown to be well - behaved functions of distance , from nearly 100% at 13  pc , to 85% at 20  pc , to 60% at 25  pc .",
    "they provide useful benchmarks against which to assess and compare samples comprised of more distant white dwarfs .",
    "other groups have been working hard to extend and complete the local white dwarf sample .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed photometric and/or spectroscopic analysis of every white dwarf suspected to lie within 20  pc of the sun .",
    "the sample was mostly drawn from the 20  pc list given in @xcite .",
    "the sample completeness was estimated to be about 90% . while it agrees well with the work cited above in the low luminosity bins , at higher luminosities ( white dwarfs hotter than about @xmath43  k ) an apparent over - density of a factor of two relative to these other luminosity functions was of concern .",
    "most likely , this was due to the small number of stars ( @xmath44 ) in the brighter bins , a hypothesis that can only be tested with much larger samples .",
    "@xcite completed a new analysis of the 25  pc sample , expanding the count of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs by about a factor of two relative to the original 20  pc sample .",
    "this expanded sample provided evidence that single white dwarfs are significantly more represented than those with one or more companions , suggesting that some companions are lost to mergers or escape during post - main sequence evolution . in addition",
    ", this study provided the first estimate of the white dwarf birthrate as a function of time from @xmath45  gyr ago to the present , indicating that the present production of white dwarfs is a factor of two to three higher than the average over this period .",
    "if mergers contributed a significant component to the white dwarf population or the birthrate has changed significantly in the galaxy these effects will need to be considered in interpreting the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "these concerns notwithstanding , the @xcite white dwarf luminosity function obtained by simple number counts is in good agreement with prior work and should be considered a more fundamental determination .    in parallel with studies focused on the luminosity function of the nearby sample of white dwarfs ,",
    "much effort has been put into quantifying it using huge samples of white dwarf candidates drawn from large new surveys .",
    "we now summarize a few of the most significant `` quantity - based projects '' .",
    "the luyten sample still has potential to improve the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "@xcite used the nltt positions , magnitudes and colors to cross - correlate to the 2mass and usno - a survey data to construct a catalog of white dwarf candidates in the overlap of regions covered by these surveys .",
    "the improvements in proper motion estimates and photometric indices derived from the 2mass @xmath46-band and estimated photographic @xmath47 magnitudes from the nltt permitted construction of reduced proper - motion diagrams that cleanly separate the main sequence , subdwarfs , and white dwarfs .",
    "the task of obtaining high quality spectroscopic identifications and cross - correlated @xmath48 photometry for nearby cool white dwarfs in the nltt catalog was undertaken by @xcite but , to date , it does not appear that a white dwarf luminosity function has been constructed for this spectroscopically identified portion of the sample .",
    "@xcite constructed a white dwarf luminosity function using proper motions based on comparison of positions between the sdss and usno surveys , high quality @xmath48 photometry , and improved atmospheric models .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , the resulting white dwarf luminosity function is surprisingly smooth and drops off abruptly at @xmath49 . because of the scarcity of stars in bins beyond the downturn",
    ", no attempt was made to derive the age of the disk or the space density of white dwarfs .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite attempted to address the incompleteness of the sdss white dwarf sample as well as the effects of contamination by other types of stars and unresolved components , but in fact the sdss does not adequately sample the nearby population of white dwarfs due to the original survey s bright limit , nor does it go deep enough to delineate the downturn .",
    "incidentally , the @xcite hot white dwarf candidates mentioned above have been shown to be from the same parent population sampled in the northern hemisphere by @xcite .",
    "thus , it provides an important supplement to the incompleteness of the sdss at the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "@xcite examined the white dwarf population within 40  pc of the sun using a spectroscopic survey of northern hemisphere candidates from the superblink proper motion database .",
    "the expanded survey subsequently evaluated by @xcite is between 66 and 78% complete .",
    "it contains almost 500 white dwarfs , an order of magnitude more than the original @xcite luminosity function .",
    "using a set of homogeneous model atmospheres , they found an unexpectedly large fraction of massive white dwarfs .",
    "these less luminous objects at the faint end of the luminosity function were often missed by previous surveys .",
    "like @xcite the disk white dwarf luminosity function obtained from this sample also has an apparent excess of hot white dwarfs , most likely due to contamination by non - da white dwarfs as in the @xcite sample .",
    "the @xcite luminosity function is the only one based on a 40  pc volume - limited sample .",
    "however , trigonometric parallaxes are still needed to clearly define the shape of the faint end of the luminosity function where the disk and halo white dwarfs mingle .",
    "@xcite simulated the @xcite survey .",
    "they were able to reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function quite well and showed the sample completeness is typically @xmath50% , for @xmath51 , beyond which it drops rapidly below 20% .",
    "they also demonstrated that the downturn in the observed luminosity function located at @xmath52 is statistically robust . using new progenitor evolutionary models and",
    "cooling sequences to model the white dwarf luminosity function constructed from the @xcite sample , they determined the age of the solar neighborhood to be about @xmath53  gyr , about a factor of two more precise than the best prior age determinations .",
    "this estimate was shown not to depend significantly on the slope of the initial mass function or the adopted initial - to - final mass relationship .",
    "however , the peak in the luminosity function was found to be shaped by a steeper initial - to - final mass relation for progenitor masses larger than about @xmath54 .",
    "an apparent bump in the luminosity function near @xmath55 was found to be significant and most likely the result of a recent burst of star formation about @xmath56  gyr ago that continues to the present era .",
    "this is roughly in accord with the empirical results of @xcite derived from the 25  pc sample .",
    "another significant step towards a definitive observed white dwarf luminosity function is the study of da white dwarfs identified in the lamost ( large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ) spectroscopic survey of the galactic anticenter ( lss - gac ) by @xcite .",
    "their study followed a well - defined set of criteria for selecting targets for observations , in contrast to other large surveys with target selection algorithms complicated by other scientific goals that make it difficult to quantify the observational biases influencing the observed populations of white dwarfs .",
    "even so , @xcite determined that the @xcite survey s incompleteness is too large in the faintest bins to confidently extend the luminosity function beyond the downturn .    to summarize this section ,",
    "the luminosity function of disk white dwarfs has been the subject of a number of studies employing different approaches . over the luminosity bins in common , all of them agree within the uncertainties quoted by each of the surveys .",
    "all have consistently found that , beginning with its bright ( hot ) end , the white dwarf luminosity function increases monotonically with increasing bolometric magnitudes at a nearly constant slope ( which stems from the cooling law ) , and terminates with an abrupt downturn near @xmath52 ( a consequence of the finite age of the galactic disk ) . enticing but very preliminary evidence for fine structure in the white dwarf luminosity function suggests that the star formation rate in the solar neighborhood has not been constant . at present , because of its large sample size and all the work that has been put into quantifying its systematic errors , incompleteness and biases , the sdss - based @xcite white dwarf luminosity function is the best benchmark against which newer studies should be compared .",
    "it was early noted @xcite that the white dwarf luminosity function could give useful constraints on the age and mass density of the galactic halo .",
    "the importance of detecting and characterizing this population of the galaxy s oldest stars to such questions as the age of the halo and to the nature of detected macho events has been reviewed by @xcite . in one of the first attempts",
    ", @xcite used just six stars with high space motions to construct a preliminary halo white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "since then , only modest increases have been achieved in the number of confirmed halo white dwarfs , because they comprise such a rare component of the solar neighborhood .",
    "in addition , the detection of halo white dwarfs is hampered by the difficulty of obtaining their three dimensional kinematical properties .",
    "sophisticated neural network techniques may prove to be useful in addressing these problems @xcite . however , radial velocities are difficult to measure for single white dwarfs because of their sizable gravitational redshifts and frequent lack of measurable absorption lines , making full three - dimensional kinematics hard to come by .",
    "this , in turn , results in difficulty distinguishing between thick disk and halo white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction @xcite and observational confirmation @xcite of depressions in the near - ir spectra of very cool white dwarfs underscored the need for improvements in cool atmosphere models as well as better observational data .",
    "below about 4,500  k , the infrared colors of white dwarfs with hydrogen - rich atmospheres become bluer as cooling progresses , due to broad opacity sources such as collisionally induced absorption by hydrogen molecules .",
    "this immediately caused concern that the fainter bins in some of the white dwarf luminosity function determinations might contain stars whose luminosities had been based on erroneous photometric parallaxes or atmospheric models .",
    "the discovery of `` cool blue degenerates '' sparked renewed interest in finding old halo white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "for example , the large space densities reported by @xcite and @xcite ignited a flurry of excitement at the prospect that ancient white dwarfs might comprise most or all of the galaxy s dark matter content .",
    "most of these objects were subsequently shown to be the result of misidentifications of thick disk white dwarfs and/or stars of indeterminate proper motion  see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "ultimately , no real improvement in the halo white dwarf luminosity function was obtained .    in an attempt to find halo white dwarfs , @xcite applied the reduced proper motion technique to a `` pencil beam '' sample of over 800 faint stars ( @xmath57 ) with proper motions of high precision in a 0.3 square degree field near the north galactic pole .",
    "eight white dwarf candidates were identified in this field .",
    "taking into account the narrowness of the field and the much smaller areal density of nearby white dwarfs across the sky , they concluded that a substantial faint population of white dwarfs may extend well above the scale height of the galaxy without significantly affecting the local white dwarf space density .",
    "their maximum likelihood method was shown to be far less sensitive to small number fluctuations that affect the @xmath58 method used by nearly all other investigations of the white dwarf luminosity function .    a robust white dwarf luminosity function for the halo should contain at least as many stars ( @xmath36 ) as the early white dwarf luminosity functions for the disk .",
    "this immediately brings to mind large surveys such as the sdss .",
    "however , despite a much larger sample size , the original sdss does not probe as deeply as the original @xcite study . among spectroscopically identified white dwarfs in the sdss",
    ", @xcite showed that the sample is complete only between @xmath59 .",
    "this is not surprising , since stars were not the primary targets of the sdss .",
    "this sample is therefore subject to very complex selection effects that are strong functions of magnitude , area , color , position in the sky and other factors  see @xcite . despite these obstacles , @xcite",
    "were able to derive improved estimates for the da white dwarf space density and formation rate that are in good agreement with prior values .",
    "the supercosmos and recons surveys @xcite were aimed at detecting halo white dwarfs .",
    "they identified @xmath60 new candidate white dwarf stars , almost two orders of magnitude larger than the first samples used to determine the white dwarf luminosity function several decades ago .",
    "@xcite used this sample to estimate the space density of white dwarfs in the halo .",
    "although the majority lack spectroscopic confirmation , the colorimetric and reduced proper motion criteria used to identify candidates were shown to be reliable ; known white dwarfs in the sample were readily identified .",
    "importantly , this group introduced a new technique to convincingly distinguish the disk and halo white dwarfs for the first time , extending the search to 1.0 and 2.5 magnitudes deeper , respectively , than the sdss study of @xcite .",
    "their results confirm the location of the downturn in the disk white dwarf luminosity function near @xmath61 .",
    "they also concluded that the different kinematic populations overlap so seriously beyond the peak in the disk white dwarf luminosity function that traditional approaches to constructing one can not render a more accurate ( thin ) disk age at the present time and only a very preliminary halo age of 1112  gyr .    in view of the large sample size and care taken to account for incompleteness ,",
    "quantify selection effects and unravel population mixing , the @xcite white dwarf luminosity functions for the thin disk , thick disk and halo are the best currently available for these population components .",
    "the various studies outlined above have determined the white dwarf luminosity function for thin disk members to a precision of a few percent for stars brighter than the downturn near @xmath62 .",
    "most of the ongoing and planned surveys seek to find enough white dwarfs to populate the lowest luminosity bins of the luminosity function where the disk and halo populations are currently hopelessly mixed , and mired in small number statistical uncertainties .",
    "many of these white dwarfs are likely be the `` cool blue degenerate stars '' noted above , if they have hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "whether they are the dominant component of the halo white dwarf population remains to be seen .",
    "this has been a topic of considerable debate  see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed the way to better use of the sdss for constructing the white dwarf luminosity function . using the sdss dr10 , they developed a selection method for white dwarfs that reliably identified white dwarf candidates based on sdss colors and reduced proper motion . from a large sample of spectroscopically",
    "confirmed white dwarfs and known contaminants ( i.e. , non - white dwarfs ) drawn from the sdss dr7 they devised a method of computing the probability of being a white dwarf for any object having only multiband photometry and proper motion data . the spectroscopic sample was limited to bright objects ( @xmath63 ) for which reliable proper motions could be obtained from prior photographic plates . applying the technique to the sdss dr10 photometric catalogue , they selected @xmath64 high - confidence white dwarf candidates , of which @xmath65 lacked spectra . on average ,",
    "the sample was found to be only about 40 per cent complete for white dwarfs hotter than @xmath66  k and brighter than @xmath67 .",
    "while they did not attempt to construct a white dwarf luminosity function , their results underscored both the remaining potential of the sdss for improving it , as well as the continuing need for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "almost 40,000 white dwarfs now have been spectroscopically identified in the various extensions of the sdss , up through its 12th data release @xcite . among these",
    "are several thousand new white dwarfs identified by @xcite in the sdss dr10 . using the best sdss spectra and the latest atmospheric models they computed temperatures , gravities , and atmospheric abundances for several thousand hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf stars ( das ) , several hundred helium atmosphere white dwarf stars ( dbs ) , as well as dozens of white dwarfs with metallic lines ( dzs ) and white dwarfs with",
    "carbon dominated spectra ( dqs ) .",
    "they also constructed the best currently available white dwarf mass distribution using model fits to high quality sdss spectra for @xmath68 das and corrected for the observed volume via the @xmath21 method .",
    "the @xcite identifications reach to @xmath69  k , although in this regime the sample is certainly not complete , as they relied on proper motion measurements ( known to be incomplete below @xmath70 ) to distinguish between cool dcs and bl lac objects . however , this huge increase in the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs is important because it enabled discovery of many rare objects such as massive white dwarfs , magnetic white dwarfs , and he - dominated objects with oxygen lines , unresolved binaries,  of special note , they compiled a list of nearly 100 white dwarf stars with masses above @xmath71 and found that the volume corrected distribution is inhomogeneous .",
    "if confirmed , this may imply mergers are a significant contributor to the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "while neither presented new determinations of the white dwarf luminosity function , the @xcite and @xcite studies are important steps to this goal and their strategies could be applied to even larger future samples . compared to previous work they followed much more well - defined criteria for selecting targets .",
    "their assessments also revealed that the incompleteness at the bolometric magnitudes typical of the downturn in the luminosity function is still large , and thus more work with still larger samples will be required to derive a reliable luminosity function at faint magnitudes .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a multi - survey approach can improve detection of nearby faint white dwarfs of low proper motions and rejecting contaminating populations of stars .    in summary ,",
    "substantial improvement in the present state of the observed white dwarf luminosity function will require several advancements in both the quality and quantity of the observational data , as well as improvements in the models used to construct and interpret it :    1 .",
    "an ultra large sample of white dwarfs , on the order of @xmath72 stars .",
    "precise parallaxes , substantially better than 1 mas . 3 .",
    "precise proper motions , substantially better than 1 mas / yr",
    "high quality photometry for a magnitude - limited sample to at least @xmath73 .",
    "spectroscopic identifications of sufficient resolution for velocity determinations .",
    "6 .   improved atmospheric models for very cool white dwarfs .",
    "7 .   improved spectral evolutionary models .",
    "better categorization and treatment of selection effects .",
    "quantification of the effects of unresolved binaries and high mass white dwarfs .    some of the above requirements can be met by existing surveys such as the expanded sdss . until gaia",
    ", however , it is unlikely that a truly definitive white dwarf luminosity function for either the disk population components or halo will be achieved , primarily since precision parallaxes and proper motions are essential to proper bin assignment and resolution of the various populations that mix at the faint end of the observed white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "this is an intractable problem for the current surveys . in short ,",
    "the downturn in the disk luminosity function for now is ill determined below about @xmath74 .",
    "further , because they comprise a tiny fraction of the local population , a complete ( or at least a very well - behaved incomplete ) sample of white dwarfs needs to be constructed to distances approaching 1 kpc in order to capture a statistically significant number of faint halo white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite estimate that gaia will find 250,000 to 500,000 white dwarfs  see also @xcite .",
    "this will open a whole new era of research on the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function can be formulated as    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the luminosity , @xmath77 is the mass of the parent star ( for convenience all white dwarfs are usually labelled with the mass of their main sequence progenitor ) , @xmath78 is the cooling time necessary to reach a luminosity @xmath76 , @xmath79 is the characteristic cooling time , @xmath80 is the main sequence lifetime of the progenitor of the white dwarf , and @xmath81 is the age of the population under study .",
    "the remaining quantities , the initial mass function , @xmath82 , and the star formation rate , @xmath83 , are not known _ a priori _ and depend on the physical properties of the stellar population under study . for context ,",
    "excellent fundamental reviews of how the luminosity function can be constructed for more general spectral types and population groups can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "obviously , both the cooling time and the characteristic cooling time must be obtained from detailed cooling sequences .",
    "clearly , the cooling rates are crucial in determining the white dwarf luminosity function . when the characteristic cooling time increases ( small cooling rates ) the number of white dwarfs per unit volume correspondingly increases .",
    "this occurs when either there is an additional release of energy in the core  such as the release of latent heat upon crystallization , see below  or when an additional source of opacity in the atmosphere appears .",
    "the reverse is also true .",
    "for instance , when neutrinos are copiously produced in the deep interior of the white dwarf the cooling rates are large , hence the white dwarf luminosity function drops below the nominal value when only the contribution due to heat capacity is taken into account .",
    "the main - sequence lifetime and a relation between the mass of the progenitor stars and the mass of the white dwarf itself must also be provided ( this is known as the initial - final mass relationship ) .",
    "usually , these last quantities are obtained from numerical fits to the available pre - white dwarf evolutionary sequences and also play a critical role in matching observed white dwarf luminosity functions .",
    "the integration limits @xmath84 and @xmath85 play an important role as well . the upper limit in eq .",
    "( [ twdlf ] ) , is the maximum mass for which a main sequence star is able to produce a white dwarf in its final evolutionary stage .",
    "as previously mentioned , this mass is still today somewhat uncertain .",
    "theoretical estimates suggest that its precise value is around @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "finally , the lower limit in eq .",
    "( [ twdlf ] ) is the minimum mass of a main sequence star able to produce a white dwarf of luminosity @xmath76 given the total age of the population under study , and it is obtained by solving the following expression :    @xmath87    which is to say that the progenitor of the white dwarf was born at @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , as the luminosity decreases the cooling time increases and the net result is that the minimum masses of the main sequence stars able to produce a white dwarf of the appropriate luminosity increase .",
    "thus , @xmath85 approaches @xmath89 for decreasing luminosities .",
    "this produces a down - turn in the theoretical white dwarf luminosity function which can be compared to the observational data , yielding an estimate of the age of the population under study .",
    "this has been ( and still is ) one of the most successful applications of the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "it is important to realize that the position of the down - turn in the white dwarf luminosity function is totally independent of the initial mass function of the population under study , a fact that makes this method very appealing .",
    "moreover , the position of the down - turn of the white dwarf luminosity function measures the time elapsed since the beginning of _ significant star formation activity _ in the population under study .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , only lower limits to the age of the population can be retrieved from the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "it should also be noted that the exact shape of the down - turn depends  although weakly  on the adopted star formation rate .",
    "abrupt down - turns occur when constant star formation rates are used , but the slope of the down - turn is shallower for slowly increasing star formation rates .",
    "also , beyond the down - turn , there is a low - luminosity tail which is due to the contribution of massive white dwarfs and/or contamination by much older halo white dwarfs .",
    "hence , the shape of this tail is sensitive to the adopted initial mass function and to the initial - to - final mass relationship",
    ". unfortunately , present white dwarf surveys are not nearly deep enough to reach this population of ultra - low luminosity white dwarfs .    in order to compare to the observations",
    "properly , it is usually convenient to bin the theoretical luminosity function in one- or half - magnitude intervals @xmath90 , in the following way :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the size of bolometric magnitude bin .",
    "this procedure introduces additional sources of uncertainty that must be taken into account  see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the procedure previously described is the most straightforward way of constructing the theoretical white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "however , there exist alternatives .",
    "the key point is that eq .",
    "( [ twdlf ] ) does not take into account the many subtle selection biases that affect the observational determination of the white dwarf luminosity function from the existing white dwarf catalogs .",
    "monte carlo techniques help to account for these subtleties . even though prior monte carlo simulators @xcite adopted very different approaches , they demonstrated useful ways to evaluate biases in the observational data .",
    "for instance , @xcite distributed white dwarfs according to a previously computed integrated luminosity function , whereas other monte carlo simulators @xcite incorporated full models of galactic structure and evolution .",
    "both approaches are valid and produce reasonable results when all the sample selection procedures and observational biases are taken into account . using these tools it has been possible to assess the quality of the observational data , the statistical significance of the samples used to obtain the observed white dwarf luminosity function , the sample selection procedures , and the method used to derive the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "we review these results below .",
    "previous observational efforts , which were described in sect .",
    "[ past ] , have provided an invaluable wealth of good quality data . moreover",
    ", ongoing projects like those detailed in sect .  [ future ] will undoubtely increase the sample of spectroscopically - identified white dwarfs with reliable determinations of parallaxes and proper motions , which are essential for an accurate determination of the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "last but not least , future space missions like gaia @xcite will dramatically increase the sample of known white dwarfs with very accurate astrometric data @xcite .",
    "however , the rapid increase in both the quality and the quantity of observational data has not been accompanied by corresponding improvements in the way observational data are analyzed .",
    "thus , the main aim of the monte carlo simulations performed up to now has been to assess the reliability of the most common method used to estimate the disk white dwarf luminosity function  the @xmath21 method @xcite  and to test other techniques which eventually could allow more accurate determinations of the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "examples of these more sophisticated techniques are , for instance , the c@xmath93 method @xcite , the sty method @xcite , the choloniewski method @xcite , and the stepwise maximum likelihood method @xcite which , among others , are currently used to derive galaxy luminosity functions .    two preliminary studies @xcite demonstrated  using two independent monte carlo simulators  that the @xmath94 method for proper - motion selected samples is a good density estimator .",
    "however , it is subject to important statistical fluctuations when estimating the slope of the bright end of the white dwarf luminosity function where the space density of stars is low and subject to small number statistical uncertainties . in the latter of these works",
    "it was also shown that a bias in the derived ages of the solar neighborhood is present  a consequence of the binning procedure .",
    "additionally , it has been shown @xcite that the size of the observational error bars assigned by the @xmath21 method is severely underestimated and that more robust luminosity function estimators should be used .",
    "these alternative estimators provide a good characterization of the shape of the white dwarf luminosity function even when small numbers of objects are used .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that for a small sample size the @xmath21 method provides a poor characterization of the less populated bins , while for large samples the choloniewski method and the @xmath42 method are comparable . in this case both provide the shape of the disc white dwarf luminosity function and the precise location of the down - turn with reasonable accuracy .",
    "this study also showed that a reliable observational white dwarf luminosity function can be best obtained by using a combination of both the @xmath42 method and the choloniewski method , while other parametric maximum - likelihood estimators are not recommended for small sample sizes .",
    "these preliminary tests also showed that these sophisticated algorithms work better for larger sample sizes .",
    "undoubtely , with the advent of massive sets of good quality observational data employing these algorithms will be among the priorities of the research field .",
    "more recently @xcite have shown that when the sample size is small it might be affected by the lutz - kelker bias @xcite and that contamination of the disk sample by high  velocity halo white dwarfs can have dramatic effects on the low  luminosity bins . work in this direction will also be one of the priorities during the next few years .",
    "as mentioned previously , the key ingredient to computed theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions is a detailed description of the cooling process of white dwarfs . in this section",
    "we provide an overview of the procedure .",
    "the evolution of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf from the planetary nebula phase to its disappearance depends on the properties of the envelope and the core .",
    "this process has been discussed in detail in a large number of papers @xcite  see also @xcite for a relatively brief review of the cooling theory of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs .",
    "the cooling of helium white dwarfs has also received extensive attention @xcite , whereas the cooling of oxygen - neon white dwarfs has received less attention @xcite .",
    "independently of the chemical composition of the core , the cooling process can be roughly divided into four stages : neutrino cooling , cooling in the fluid phase , crystallization and debye cooling .",
    "we discuss each phase in the following subsections . in",
    "what follows the luminosity ( instead of the magnitude ) will be used to describe these phases , as it is customary in the field . to ease the comparison with observational studies we remind the reader that the absolute magnitude and the luminosity of the white dwarf are related by the well - known expression @xmath95 , where b.c .",
    "is the bolometric correction that accounts for the portion of the star s spectral energy distribution that does not pass through the @xmath47 filter @xcite .      the first evolutionary phase of typical white dwarfs is dominated by neutrino cooling .",
    "this phase occurs for @xmath96 .",
    "it is rather complicated because the initial conditions of the star and the behavior of the envelope are still not yet fully understood .",
    "for instance , if the thickness of the hydrogen layer is large enough the luminosity due to hydrogen burning through the pp - chain may never stop and could become dominant at low luminosities , i.e. , @xmath97 @xcite . in this case",
    "the cooling rate would be similar to that obtained ignoring this source of energy , and it would be observationally impossible to distinguish between the two .",
    "however , the importance of continued h - burning strongly depends on the mass , @xmath98 , of the hydrogen layer . if @xmath99 , the pp contribution quickly drops and never becomes dominant , except for low - mass , low - metallicity white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "since astero - seismological observations seem to constrain the size of @xmath98 well below this critical value , this source can be neglected .",
    "fortunately , when neutrino emission becomes dominant , the different thermal structures converge to a unique solution , assuring the uniformity of models with @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , since the time necessary to reach this value is @xmath101 years for any model @xcite , its influence in the total cooling time is negligible .    after the neutrino cooling phase the core of the white dwarf is liquid .",
    "this stage occurs for luminosities in the range @xmath102 .",
    "here gravothermal energy becomes dominant .",
    "since the plasma is not very strongly coupled , its properties are reasonably well known @xcite . to characterize the properties of the plasma it is customary to define the coulomb coupling parameter    @xmath103    where    @xmath104    @xmath105 is the atomic charge , @xmath106 is the inter - electronic distance , @xmath107 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath108 is the electron charge , and @xmath81 is the temperature .",
    "this phase is characterized by small coulomb coupling parameters , @xmath109 . during this phase",
    "the observed luminosity is controlled by a thick non - degenerate layer with an opacity dominated by hydrogen ( if present ) and helium , and it is weakly dependent on the metal content .",
    "the main source of uncertainty is related to the chemical structure of the interior , which depends on the rather uncertain adopted rate of the reaction and on the treatment given to semiconvection and overshooting during the pre - white dwarf evolutionary phases .",
    "if this rate is high , the oxygen abundance is higher in the center than in the outer layers .",
    "this results in a reduction of the specific heat at the central layers where the oxygen abundance can reach values as high as @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "when the coulomb coupling parameter reaches a critical value , @xmath111 , crystallization at the center of the white dwarf sets in , and a new cooling phase starts , as early recognized by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "crystallization leads to the release of latent heat , which then controls the evolution of white dwarfs @xcite , and to the release of gravitational energy due to phase separation .",
    "the typical luminosities during this phase are @xmath112 .",
    "the release of gravitational energy associated with changes in the chemical composition induced by crystallization in carbon - oxygen mixtures has been examined by @xcite .",
    "finally , the consequences of the deposition of @xmath113ne , the most abundant of the impurities present in the central regions of a white dwarf have been examined @xcite . a similar calculation for @xmath114fe , the second most important impurity ,",
    "was made somewhat later @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on this below , in sect .",
    "[ minor ] .",
    "crystallization introduces two new sources of energy : latent heat and sedimentation ( a form of gravitational energy release ) . in the case of coulomb plasmas , the latent heat is small , of the order of @xmath115 per nucleon , where @xmath116 is the temperature of solidification .",
    "its contribution to the total luminosity is small , @xmath117% , but not negligible @xcite .    during the crystallization process ,",
    "the equilibrium chemical compositions of the solid and liquid plasmas are not equal .",
    "therefore , if the resulting solid flakes are denser than the liquid mixture , they sink towards the central regions . if they are lighter , they rise upwards and melt when the solidification temperature , which depends on the density , becomes equal to that of the isothermal core .",
    "the net effect is a migration of the heavier elements towards the central regions with the subsequent release of gravitational energy @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the process depends on the detailed chemical composition and on the initial chemical profile .",
    "it is most efficient in a mixture made of half oxygen and half carbon uniformly distributed throughout the star .",
    "the first calculation of a phase diagram for c / o mixtures yielded an eutectic shape @xcite , denoting a mixture of elements in fixed proportions that solidifies and melts at a given temperature that is lower than the melting points of either constituent or different mixture .",
    "this resulted from the assumption that the solid was entirely random , so that the free energy is given by @xmath118 @xcite , where @xmath119 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "since the mixture retains some short range order , the free energy is then given by the linear mixing rule , @xmath120 .",
    "the solid phase is less stable , and thus @xmath121 , resulting in an eutectic behavior of the phase diagram .",
    "the density functional theory of freezing and the mean spherical approximation , but with the same diameter for the two chemical species , were used later to compute the correlation between the particles , and a phase diagram of spindle form was obtained @xcite . a similar calculation in the framework of the density functional theory , but using the improved hypernetted chain approximation to compute the correlation functions , was performed , producing an azeotropic phase diagram @xcite , indicating a mixture of liquids whose proportions are not affected by a phase change .",
    "finally , these calculations were extended to include the effects of the different diameters of the two chemical species @xcite and the same results of @xcite were found .",
    "more recently , @xcite computed a new phase diagram for the c / o mixture using an advanced technique , direct molecular dynamics , again agreeing with previous results , thus settling this issue .",
    "the so - called debye cooling phase comes last .",
    "it occurs at small luminosities , typically @xmath122 , when the star is almost entirely crystallized . during this cooling phase for a large fraction of the crystallized core",
    "the specific heat follows debye s law , and scales as @xmath123 .",
    "due to the reduced specific heat , cooling accelerates and the star s luminosity drops abruptly . however , the outer layers still have very large temperatures relative to the debye temperature , and since their total heat capacity is still large enough , they prevent the sudden disappearance of the white dwarf , at least when the envelope is thick @xcite .      the importance of the atmospheric treatment in the cooling models for white dwarfs can not be overstated . in",
    "the strongly degenerate core energy transfer by electron conduction dominates .",
    "this has been shown to be a very efficient mechanism .",
    "thus , the cores of white dwarfs are essentially isothermal .",
    "however , in the outer layers radiation and , depending on the effective temperature , convection dominates the energy transfer . in these layers",
    "the temperature profile is determined by the equation of state .",
    "thus , changes in atmospheric parameters directly affect the core temperature and , since white dwarf cooling is driven largely by the slow leakage of the thermal reservoir stored in the core , it moderates the cooling rate . until recently the atmospheric treatment was based on grey atmospheres and rosseland mean opacities .",
    "modern calculations incorporate detailed non - grey atmospheres .",
    "recall that at low effective temperatures , collision - induced absorption by molecular hydrogen due to collisions with h@xmath124 represents a major source of opacity in the infrared and dominates the shape of the emergent spectrum .",
    "thus , very cool white dwarfs with hydrogen - dominated atmospheres begin to turn blue at about 4,500 k , whereas helium - dominated atmospheres resemble black bodies @xcite .",
    "the cooling rate , in both cases , depends sensitively on the adopted mass and composition of the envelope , and the age differences are substantial , larger than 1.5  gyr , at the relevant luminosities , @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "we note here that for all the cooling phases described in the previous section the importance of the envelope is crucial for two reasons .",
    "clearly , more transparent envelopes result in faster energy losses and shorter cooling times .",
    "this is true for all the previously listed cooling phases .",
    "the second reason is more subtle and was largely overlooked until some time ago @xcite , but it is essential to take into account during the crystallization phase .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that at approximately the same evolutionary stage in which crystallization sets in , the external convection zone penetrates the region where thermal conduction by degenerate electrons is very efficient . such an occurrence ( known as convective coupling ) , initially produces a further decrease in the cooling rate , followed by a more rapid decline .",
    "in fact , it has been proven that the delay introduced by the convective coupling can be as large as that produced by chemical differentiation during crystallization @xcite .",
    "minor chemical species like @xmath113ne or @xmath114fe can also play an important role in the cooling of white dwarfs .",
    "these minor chemical species are the products of the pre - white dwarf evolutionary stages .",
    "the most abundant is @xmath113ne .",
    "its abundance is directly related to the initial abundances of cno elements , which , after the h - burning phase become @xmath126n .",
    "this isotope , in turn , becomes @xmath113ne after the series of reactions @xmath126n@xmath127o@xmath128ne , during the he - burning phase . because of its large neutron number and the high sensitivity of degenerate structures to the electron number profile",
    ", @xmath113ne can induce a large release of gravitational energy if , as a consequence of crystallization , it migrates towards the center during crystallization @xcite .",
    "for stars of solar metallicity , the typical abundances are 12% .",
    "a similar effect can be produced by the deposition of @xmath114fe at the center @xcite . in this case ,",
    "typical abundances are 0.1% .",
    "the physics of the deposition of the minor species is intricate since it depends on the behavior of a multicomponent phase diagram that is not yet known .",
    "a first step consists in assuming that the c / o / ne or c / o / fe mixtures behave as an effective binary mixture composed of neon ( or iron ) and an average element , representative of the c / o mixture .",
    "the phase diagram for arbitrary ionic mixtures as a function of the charge ratio has been computed by @xcite . it was found that the phase diagram is of the spindle form for @xmath129 , of the azeotropic form for @xmath130 and of the eutectic form for @xmath131 . in the case of a c / o mixture made of equal mass fractions of carbon and oxygen , the resulting average element has such a charge that the corresponding phase diagram shows an azeotropic behavior with an azeotropic abundance of @xmath132 .",
    "this means that white dwarfs are in the neon - poor side of the phase diagram .",
    "consequently , the solid in equilibrium with the liquid has a smaller concentration of neon and , since it is lighter than the surrounding liquid , it will rise and melt in lower density regions so that the neon concentration in the liquid will increase until it reaches the azeotropic composition .",
    "this process will continue until all @xmath113ne is collected in a central sphere of mass @xmath133 .",
    "following the procedure described in @xcite for computing the decrease in the cooling rates suggests that the total energy release in the case of @xmath113ne is @xmath134  erg for a typical @xmath135 white dwarf . at the corresponding luminosity , this would result in an unrealistic delay of about 9  gyr , indicating that there is a problem with the adopted assumptions .",
    "for the case of @xmath114fe under the same conditions the energy released is much smaller , @xmath136 erg , and thus the resulting time delay is also much smaller , @xmath137  gyr .",
    "the assumption of an effective binary mixture of the c / o / ne mixture is probably not very realistic .",
    "in fact , a preliminary ternary diagram has been computed for the c / o / ne mixture @xcite .",
    "this phase diagram displays the expected behavior at the binary limit ( spindle form for the c / o mixture , azeotropic form for the c / ne mixture and spindle form for the o / ne mixture ) . for small concentrations of neon , of the order of a few percent , and temperatures well above the azeotropic temperature ,",
    "the crystallization diagram is not influenced by the presence of neon .",
    "however , as the temperature approaches the azeotrope , the resulting solid is lighter than the surrounding liquid and the distillation process starts as in the previous case .",
    "the main difference is that it starts in the outer layers instead of the central layers and the effect of separation is therefore much smaller . as a matter of fact",
    ", the total energy released in this case is @xmath138 erg and the corresponding effect on the cooling times are hence much smaller , of the order of 0.6 gyr .    up to this moment",
    "we have reviewed the role played by the impurities in the cooling of white dwarfs during the crystallizing phase .",
    "however , it is important to realize that @xmath113ne can also play an important role during the liquid cooling phase .",
    "building on earlier work @xcite it has been recently shown @xcite that due to the large neutron excess of @xmath113ne it sinks towards the interior as the liquid white dwarf cools .",
    "the subsequent gravitational energy released slows the cooling of the white dwarf by 0.251.6 gyr by the time it has completely crystallized , depending on the white dwarf mass and on the adopted sedimentation rate .",
    "this effect will make massive white dwarfs or those in metal - rich clusters appear younger than their true age .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that this is indeed the case , and that the slowdown of the white dwarf cooling rate owing to the release of gravitational energy from @xmath113ne sedimentation and carbon - oxygen phase separation upon crystallization is of fundamental importance to reconcile the age discrepancy of the very old , metal - rich open cluster ngc  6791 . nevertheless , although the white dwarf luminosity function of this open cluster provides a statistical measure",
    ", a direct test remains to be done . since there is no way to measure the metallicity of single white dwarf progenitors we would need a wide binary composed of a non - evolved star and a white dwarf , for which we could accurately measure the age and metallicity using independent methods @xcite .",
    "@lcl input & @xmath139 ( gyr ) & comments + core composition & @xmath140 & depending on the + opacity & @xmath141 & + conductive opacity & @xmath142 & + metals in the envelope & @xmath143 & + metallicity of the progenitor & @xmath144 & +   + c / o & 0.81.2 & depending on the + fe & @xmath145 & + ne & @xmath146 & ternary mixture + observational & 12 & +    table  [ tab : cool ] displays the uncertainties in the time necessary for a typical white dwarf of @xmath37 to reach a luminosity of @xmath147 . in the bottom section of this table the additive contributions to the uncertainty due to the physics of crystallization are shown , whereas the top section describes the uncertainties due to the rest of the input physics .",
    "the major contribution is provided by the minor chemical species and all contributions are of the same order of magnitude , @xmath148  gyr .",
    "the largest contributions come from the core composition and the conductive opacities @xcite .",
    "also the adopted composition of the envelope has an important influence on age estimates for a white dwarf population , although hydrogen - rich cooling sequences are usually adopted , as most observational determinations of the white dwarf luminosity function rely on the population of da white dwarfs .",
    "there is , however , another point of concern , namely how the different numerical implementations of the evolutionary codes affect the accuracy of the cooling times .",
    "this issue has been examined by @xcite .",
    "these authors compare the cooling ages obtained using a set of controlled input physics and very different numerical schemes .",
    "this comparison shows that when the same physical inputs are adopted the cooling ages do not differ by more than a very modest @xmath149 at all luminosities , in sharp contrast with main sequence ages , for which the typical differences are of the order of @xmath150 , or even larger .",
    "this difference is smaller than the uncertainties in cooling times attributable to the present uncertainties in the white dwarf chemical stratification .",
    "hence , white dwarf cooling ages turn out to be even more robust than main sequence evolutionary ages .",
    "in this section we discuss the other main quantities needed to compute theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions . in particular , we discuss the appropriate choice of an initial - to - final mass relationship , which main sequence lifetimes can be used to calculate luminosity functions , which initial mass functions are usually employed in the theoretical calculations , and finally , we also provide a preliminary discussion of the role of the star formation rate .",
    "one of the key ingredients of a theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions is a relationship linking the mass of the white dwarf and that of its progenitor at the zero age main sequence .",
    "it is well known that theoretical evolutionary calculations predict a positive correlation between both quantities .",
    "however , the precise shape of the initial - to - final mass relationship is troublesome to predict on theoretical grounds alone .",
    "this is a consequence of the intrinsic difficulties associated with modeling several complex physical phenomena involved in the final phases of stellar evolution .",
    "a number of theoretical works have attempted to address these issues @xcite , but the area is an ongoing active field of research , and remains open . in general , the theoretical predictions depend sensitively on many subtle details of the evolutionary codes @xcite .",
    "however , there is a general consensus that this relationship is almost linear for progenitor masses between @xmath151 and @xmath152 @xcite , although there are indications that the slope becomes steeper for masses larger than roughly @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "the question of whether this relationship depends on the metallicity of the population under study remains controversial  see , for instance @xcite , and references therein .",
    "much effort has been invested in empirically determining the slope of the initial - to - final mass relationship .",
    "this is usually done by employing either open clusters or detached , non - interacting binaries composed of a white dwarf and a main sequence star .",
    "the best - studied systems of the latter kind are common proper motion pairs . for these binaries",
    "we are confident that both stars are physically associated . in both cases we know the total age , and hence the total age of a given white dwarf ( cooling age plus the lifetime of its progenitor ) .",
    "this allows determination of the mass of its progenitor , once the mass of the white dwarf is measured , provided that an accurate relationship between the mass and the main sequence lifetime is available  that is , a set of reliable isochrones .",
    "the main drawback of employing open clusters for this task is that well - populated clusters are needed .",
    "additionally , since usually open clusters are young , they only probe a limited range of masses , between 2.5 and @xmath154 , an interval corresponding to the most massive white dwarfs . moreover",
    ", open clusters often show a metallicity spread , and the information about the metallicity of the progenitor of the white dwarf is lost once the star becomes a white dwarf .",
    "this , in turn , introduces an uncertainty .",
    "@xcite pioneered the observational efforts to empirically determine the initial - to - final mass relationship using open clusters , studying white dwarfs in hyades and pleiades . following this early work several other clusters were studied @xcite , and",
    "it is expected that this work will be extended to fainter and older clusters in the coming years .",
    "common proper motion pairs @xcite provide a work - around for most of these concerns .",
    "in such binaries the stars have never interacted and both components evolve as single stars . as they were born simultaneously , the total age of the white dwarf can be split into its cooling age and that of its progenitor star .",
    "the age of the companion star ( hence , the total age of the binary system ) is measured using an independent method , for example a set of theoretical isochrones of the appropriate metallicity , from rotation rate , or from chromospheric activity .",
    "the main inconvenience of this method is that reliable age determinations are available for only a handful of binary systems @xcite .    a third method , though less frequently employed , to determine the shape of the initial - to - final mass relationship is to calculate the difference of cooling times between two white dwarfs in a double degenerate system @xcite .",
    "until recently this method was hampered by the small number of such systems known .",
    "@xcite identified new candidate double degenerates in the sdss , bringing the total known to 142 .",
    "for over 50 systems , they were able to derive masses and cooling ages from balmer line spectra and employed a bayesian statistical approach to fitting the most probable initial - to - final mass ratio consistent with the sample for initial masses of @xmath155 .",
    "open clusters provide little leverage within this mass range , so double degenerates provide a valuable alternative approach .",
    "since these methods make use of both observed data and theoretical models the results are known as semi - empirical initial - to - final mass relationships .    in any case , there are two options to compute theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions . either semi - empirical , or theoretical initial - to - final mass relationships can be employed . in general ,",
    "most theoretical calculations of the luminosity function of disk white dwarfs are done using semi - empirical relationships , whereas when luminosity functions of stellar systems with known metallicity are computed theoretical initial - to - final mass relationships of the appropriate metallicity are employed .",
    "this includes the calculation of white dwarf luminosity functions for the galactic halo , or for open and globular clusters in the galaxy .",
    "main sequence lifetimes are also necessary to theoretically derive white dwarf luminosity functions  see eq .",
    "( [ twdlf ] ) .",
    "ideally , one should use main sequence lifetimes consistent with the adopted initial - to - final mass relationship .",
    "however , this is not always possible .",
    "hence , many calculations employ a simple relationship between the mass of the progenitor of a white dwarf at the zero age main sequence and its lifetime .",
    "an example of this simple relationship is that of @xcite :    @xmath156    however , there are more sophisticated treatments , which include the use of interpolation in theoretical isochrones .",
    "an example of such more elaborated treatments consists in interpolating within the basti isochrones for the appropriate metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor @xcite .",
    "another , less relevant but necessary , input to compute theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions is the initial mass function .",
    "this function peaks at a few tenths of a solar mass , and shows an extended tail for masses larger than this value .",
    "it is customary to model this tail as a power law , with a fixed exponent , or in some cases as a combination of power laws , again with fixed exponents .",
    "a thorough discussion of the initial mass function is far beyond the scope of this work , but the interested reader will find useful the excellent review of @xcite . as a matter of fact , most studies employ the classical salpeter - like initial mass function @xcite , which is a power law with just one index @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath157 , where @xmath77 is the mass at the zero age main sequence . in some cases",
    "the power - law index is considered a free parameter to fit the observations .",
    "however , more sophisticated studies prefer to employ the so - called `` universal '' mass function of @xcite  which for the mass range relevant to most stellar systems is totally equivalent to a two - branch power law with exponent @xmath158 , with @xmath159 for @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "finally , sometimes a top - heavy initial mass function : @xmath163 is adopted . in this expression @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this initial mass function was introduced by @xcite , and is dominated by high mass stars .",
    "it has been found that this function better reproduces the characteristics of metal - poor populations , namely those with [ fe / h]@xmath166 .",
    "the final ingredient in the calculation of a theoretical white dwarf luminosity function is the star formation rate .",
    "the star formation rate depends on the characteristics of the population under study . for the case of the disk white dwarf population",
    "a constant star formation rate is usually adopted , whereas for metal - poor populations  namely the stellar spheroid and the system of globular clusters  a short , intense burst of star formation is adopted . typically , the duration of the burst is a free parameter that can be used to better fit the observed white dwarf luminosity function and the color distribution .",
    "in fact , if all the ingredients to model the white dwarf luminosity function are known with good accuracy one could eventually use eq .",
    "[ twdlf ] to solve the inverse problem and derive the star formation history of the population under study . unfortunately , this is not usually possible , and moreover , the solution of the inverse problem does not have a unique solution .",
    "we elaborate on this in sect .",
    "as mentioned above , the potential use of white dwarf stars as chronometers was recognized several decades ago @xcite , but only in the last two decades has there been good observational data and reliable theoretical cooling sequences which are necessary to interpret them in terms of an age for the galactic disk .",
    "a determination from the white dwarf luminosity function of the age of the halo population still remains to be done , due to the scarcity of halo white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the evidence for a decrease in the number counts of white dwarfs at lower luminosities was suspected but unobtainable until larger telescopes with more quantum efficient detectors were applied to systematic surveys for white dwarfs .",
    "in fact , the early white dwarf luminosity functions were constrained by the available data , and only the bright portion of the luminosity function  namely , those bins with @xmath167  had reliable determinations . however , the improved observational efforts resulted in the first convincing identification of a down - turn in the disk white dwarf luminosity function @xcite , which was interpreted as a consequence of the finite galactic age @xcite .",
    "this discovery was followed by a series of papers in which progressively more sophisticated cooling sequences , observing strategies and analysis techniques were employed @xcite .",
    "the effect of the white dwarf initial - to - final mass relation on the luminosity function has been examined by @xcite . fitting theoretical luminosity functions from a variety of stellar evolutionary inputs to the average of the observed luminosity functions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , it was shown that the only significant difference between the theoretical fits occurs beyond the down - turn in the luminosity function , where current data is sparse .",
    "they also found that a disk age of @xmath168  gyr consistently fit their composite observed luminosity function best , a value that is substantially older than prior determinations . at present there does not appear to be a generally - accepted age for the galactic disk derived from the white dwarf luminosity function  it should still be regarded as a work in progress because of the difficulty in obtaining a statistically significant sample of stars in the most important faintest luminosity bins as well as remaining uncertainties in core composition and atmospheric opacities in the coolest white dwarfs .",
    "however , a rough average derived from the references discussed in this review  see table  [ spaced ]  suggests that star formation in the solar neighborhood ( thin disk ) began about 10  gyr ago .",
    "this estimate is uncertain by at least ten percent .    finally , it is worth emphasizing that the age estimates obtained using the down - turn in the disk white dwarf luminosity function , regardless of the observed sample , are very robust lower limits .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the white cooling ages obtained employing different numerical evolutionary codes differ by only a few percent when a standard set of physical assumptions is adopted , a quite remarkable feature . not only that , it has been recently demonstrated @xcite that the age estimates of the solar neighborhood obtained by fitting the position of the down - turn in the disk white dwarf luminosity function do not depend on the adopted metallicity law , also ensuring the age determined in this way very reliable .",
    "however , a study of super - solar metallicity stars , [ m / h ]  @xmath169  + 0.1 dex , by @xcite employing data from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) dr4 suggests that the angular momentum of numerous stars have been increased by scattering at corotation resonance of the galaxy s spiral arms from regions well within the sun s galactocentric radius .",
    "this may have ramifications for the local white dwarf luminosity function that remain to be explored .",
    "one would expect the age of the halo derived from the white dwarf luminosity function to be more uncertain than that obtained for the disk , primarily because the halo component is older and comprises at most a few percent of the local white dwarf population .",
    "thus , the typical halo white dwarf is distant and faint .",
    "however , based on the handful of currently available studies of the halo white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and in nearby globular clusters ( see table  [ spaced ] ) it can be said that star formation began in that population subgroup at least 11  gyr ago .",
    "in addition to an absolute age for the galactic disk and space density of white dwarfs , the white dwarf luminosity function also contains information about the star formation and death rates over the history of the galaxy .",
    "however , it is important to note that because cool white dwarfs have very long evolutionary time scales , the past galactic star formation rate influences the shape of the low luminosity portion of the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "also , due to the extremely long main sequence lifetimes of low mass stars , which are the progenitors of bright white dwarfs , the shape of the hot branch of the white dwarf luminosity function is also sensitive to the past star formation activity .",
    "all this implies that the past star formation activity is still influencing the present white dwarf birthrate and that the past star formation rate could be retrieved from the white dwarf luminosity function , as clearly seen in eq .",
    "( [ twdlf ] ) .",
    "provided that we have a reliable determination of the white dwarf luminosity function and accurate cooling models , the star formation rate , @xmath83 , can be obtained by solving an inverse problem . this has not been possible yet due in part to the discrepancies between the different observational determinations of the white dwarf luminosity function and also to the still relatively large error bars in each bin .",
    "in addition , from the theoretical point of view , the inverse transformation can not be easily done because the kernel of the transformation is complicated and , more importantly , it is not symmetric .",
    "these are the reasons why very few papers have explored the possibility of doing some sort of galactic archaelogy using the luminosity function of white dwarfs as a tracer of the star formation activity .",
    "however , this situation may be improving  see , for example , @xcite .    in order to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "several possibilities have been suggested .",
    "the first and most straightforward method requires _ a priori _ knowledge of the shape of the star formation history and consists of adopting a trial function that depends on several parameters , followed by a search for the values of these parameters that best fit the observed luminosity function .",
    "this is accomplished by minimizing the differences between the observed and computed luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "the second possibility consists of computing the luminosity function for massive white dwarfs @xcite , which have negligible main sequence lifetimes , thus making much easier the solution of the inverse problem .",
    "unfortunately , such white dwarfs are rare .",
    "also , if a significant fraction of massive white dwarfs results from double white dwarf mergers , the problem becomes more complicated , as the method relies on the assumption that white dwarfs with moderately high masses ( say between 0.8 and @xmath170 ) are the result of single star evolution .",
    "finally , @xcite presented recently an algorithm for inverting the white dwarf luminosity function to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the star formation rate in the solar neighborhood .",
    "as expected from the discussion above , the results were found to be most sensitive to the choice of white dwarf cooling models .",
    "use of the algorithm on two independent determinations of the white dwarf luminosity function gave similar results : a bimodal star formation rate with broad peaks 23  gyr and 79  gyr before the present , with star formation commencing about 810  gyr ago .",
    "@xcite employed individual white dwarf atmosphere models and a complete volume - limited `` 20 parsec sample '' to investigate the local star formation history in the solar neighborhood and concluded that an enhancement in star formation rate ( and consequent increase in white dwarf space density ) occurred within the past 5  gyr , enhancing the space density of white dwarfs by a factor of @xmath171 .",
    "this roughly agrees with a peak reported by @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to discern structure in observed luminosity functions .",
    "an early study @xcite modeled the effect that various bursts of star formation would have on the white dwarf luminosity function and suggested a modest bump noted by @xcite might be evidence for such an event about 0.3  gyr ago .",
    "the impact of merger episodes in the galactic disk on the white dwarf population was examined by @xcite using a monte carlo simulator .",
    "this study concluded that only relatively small merger episodes involving a few percent or less of the current disk population white dwarfs are compatible with the current kinematics of known white dwarfs and that the white dwarf luminosity function is insensitive to such events .",
    "more recently , attention has been called to a plateau in the white dwarf luminosity function obtained from the sloan digital sky survey near @xmath172 @xcite  see figure  [ fig : disk ] .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to a cooling time of 0.3  gyr . adding the main - sequence lifetime of 2.5 gyr  for the typical progenitor suggests that a drop in star formation rate may have occurred about 3 gyr ago after a burst or long duration of higher rate of star formation .",
    "so far , not much other work appears to have been attempted in this area , probably because until very recently the sample size of white dwarfs have been small enough that statistical uncertainties dominate the luminosity bins . however , there is reason to be hopeful , because much larger samples of white dwarfs are becoming available .    of particular interest",
    "are the delays between the onset of star formation in the thin disk , thick disk and halo .",
    "however , a few caveats are in order . some of these include possible changes in the initial mass function @xcite , uncertainties in white dwarf core composition and chemical profile @xcite , phase separation @xcite , incompleteness of the sample @xcite , unresolved binary star fraction @xcite and statistical limitations of the method chosen to construct the white dwarf luminosity function @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have been published which attempted to determine the properties of the halo @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that the halo white dwarf luminosity function not only carries information about the age of the halo but also  under certain circumstances  about the initial mass function of the halo .",
    "if , as generally accepted , the halo was formed in a very short time scale the halo star formation rate can be well approximated by a burst of negligible duration and the calculation of the integral of eq .",
    "( [ twdlf ] ) can be simplified , since for all halo white dwarfs we have    @xmath173    in this scenario , each luminosity corresponds to a given mass of the white dwarf progenitor . in other words ,",
    "the halo white dwarf luminosity function maps the mass of the progenitor of the white dwarf as a function of the luminosity , @xmath174 . taking into account that the white dwarf luminosity function is the number of white dwarfs per unit bolometric magnitude , @xmath175",
    ", we have :    @xmath176    thus , once we have complete samples of the halo white dwarf population and reliable observational determinations of the halo white dwarf luminosity function , the initial mass function of the halo can be experimentally obtained .",
    "this assumes , of course , that we have accurate and precise white dwarf cooling sequences .",
    "another concern is that the initial - to - final mass relation for white dwarfs could depend upon the metallicity of their main sequence progenitors  see @xcite .",
    "the expectation is that low metallicity halo white dwarfs are born with thicker hydrogen envelopes , leading to more prolonged shell burning than in disc white dwarfs .",
    "in addition , stars of higher primordial metallicity are expected to be more efficient in shedding mass during the agb phase , resulting in lower mass white dwarfs .",
    "consequently , this could affect the white dwarf luminosity function and its interpretation for different populations @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the most recent work on this problem suggests that the shape of the white dwarf luminosity function from bright to faint bin is relatively insensitive to metallicity @xcite .",
    "other applications of the white dwarf luminosity function include independent constraints on the physical mechanisms operating during the cooling process , an independent test of the constancy of the gravitational constant , @xmath177 , and its use as an astro - particle physics laboratory .",
    "we examine all three below .",
    "as shown previously , the white dwarf luminosity function carries important information about the physics of cooling .",
    "consequently , a reliable white dwarf luminosity function would allow us to test both the mechanisms operating at high effective temperatures  basically neutrino cooling  and the mechanisms which are dominant for relatively low core temperatures ( crystallization ) .",
    "neutrinos are the dominant form of energy loss in model white dwarf stars down to @xmath178 , depending on the stellar mass .",
    "consequently , the evolutionary timescales of white dwarfs at these luminosities sensitively depend on the ratio of the neutrino energy loss to the photon energy loss .",
    "thus , the slope of the bright end of the white dwarf luminosity function directly reflects the importance of neutrino emission . although the unified electroweak theory of lepton interactions that is crucial for understanding neutrino production has been well tested in the high - energy regime",
    " see , for instance , @xcite for an excellent review  the white dwarf luminosity function could help to test the low - energy regime of the theory @xcite .",
    "for example , recent work by @xcite using the best available white dwarf luminosity functions and including the effects of observational errors and binning have set a firm limit on the neutrino magnetic dipole moment ; @xmath179 .",
    "this is comparable to the constraints on @xmath180 set by studies of globular clusters .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function can also put constraints on the physical mechanisms that operate at low core temperatures , namely crystallization and phase separation . as discussed previously",
    ", the inclusion of phase separation upon crystallization in the cooling sequences adds an additional delay to the cooling ( and , thus , considerably modifies the characteristic cooling times at low luminosities ) , which depends on the initial chemical profile ( the ratio of carbon to oxygen ) and on the transparency of the insulating envelope .",
    "thus , if a direct measure of the disk age with reasonable precision is obtained by an independent method , say via main sequence turn - off stars , the white dwarf luminosity function directly probes the physics of crystallization .",
    "it is worth noting as well that not only the exact location of the down - turn of the disk white dwarf luminosity function is affected by the details of the cooling sequences but also the position and the shape of the maximum of the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "thus , additional tests are possible .",
    "a second application of the white dwarf luminosity function involves setting constraints on a hypothetical variation of the gravitational constant , @xmath177 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , when white dwarfs are cool enough , their energy is entirely of gravitational and thermal origin , and any change in the value of @xmath177 modifies the energy balance .",
    "this in turn translates into a change of luminosity .",
    "second , since they are long - lived objects , @xmath0 gyr , even extremely small values of the rate of change of @xmath177 can have detectable effects .",
    "the first attempts to obtain constraints on @xmath181 from the cooling of white dwarfs @xcite were unsuccessful due to the lack of reliable observational data and the uncertainties in the cooling theory of white dwarfs . since then both the observational data and the cooling theory have been improved substantially , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ cooling ] .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for the case of a secularly varying @xmath177 , the luminosity of a cool enough white dwarf is given by :    @xmath182    where @xmath183 is the binding energy , @xmath13 is the thermal energy and @xmath184 is the gravitational energy .",
    "as the white dwarf cools , the thermal content decreases and the second term in eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) dominates .",
    "note as well that the cooling process is accelerated if @xmath185 . by comparing the results of the previous equation with the observed position of the down - turn in the white dwarf luminosity function ,",
    "the following firm limit was obtained :    @xmath186    at the @xmath187 confidence level @xcite .",
    "this result was challenged by @xcite , who obtained a much tighter bound using the same method , but their analysis was subsequently shown to be flawed .",
    "this issue was finally settled by detailed evolutionary calculations @xcite , which corroborated the preliminary analytical calculations of @xcite .",
    "we mention here that a tighter bound was obtained by @xcite using the white dwarf luminosity function of the open , metal - rich , well - populated cluster ngc  6791 :    @xmath188    the last and most exotic application of the white dwarf luminosity function we would like to discuss here is its use as an astro - particle physics laboratory .",
    "pulsating white dwarfs have been used frequently for such a purpose @xcite .",
    "for example , the plasma neutrino process has been tested using pulsating db white dwarfs  see @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the existence of neutrinos has been known for many years , yet there are other exotic particles that have been postulated by theorists that have not been detected so far .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function can help in this regard .",
    "for instance , the mass of the axion has been constrained using zz  ceti white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function appears to leave little room for other theorized weakly interacting exotic particles such as  massive dark photons   and `` dark sector particles '' lighter than a few kev @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown very recently that the white dwarf luminosity function can be used to derive consistent upper limits to the mass of the axion , and the axion - electron coupling constant ( @xmath189 ) of dfsz - axions @xcite .",
    "clearly , more accurate constraints would be enabled by improved observational white dwarf luminosity functions .",
    "although it has been used to construct nearly every white dwarf luminosity function to date , the @xmath42 technique is very vulnerable to undetected incompleteness and small sample statistical uncertainties .",
    "it has been shown  see , for instance , sect .",
    "[ mc ] , @xcite , and @xcite  that the age estimate resulting from the @xmath42 method is also very sensitive to the choice of assumed galactic disk scale height , binning interval , placement of bin centers , and that the space density is inherently uncertain by at least 50% in samples containing less than @xmath190 stars .",
    "also , the vast majority of known white dwarfs do not meet the completeness magnitude and proper motion limits imposed by the @xmath21 technique , so they can not be included in the standard white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that other techniques not previously used on white dwarfs do better in identifying the luminosity down - turn and the total space density .",
    "it will be important to use more sophisticated techniques such as these on the large samples of white dwarfs that will be available soon .",
    "the next decade holds much promise for a definitive determination of the white dwarf luminosity function for each of the three major stellar components of the solar neighborhood . among the first opportunities for improvement will be panstarrs data @xcite ,",
    "which will cover the entire sky observed in the course of the sdss on timescales of less than a week , reaching 24@xmath191 magnitude in each frame  23 magnitudes fainter than the best large area surveys available today .",
    "panstarrs opens a new time domain on the sky that has exciting potential for discovery in a wide range of astronomy , ranging from the search for near earth asteroids to gamma ray burster afterglows .",
    "two of the science objectives of panstarrs will contribute directly to improving the white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "the solar neighborhood ( sol ) project will build an all - sky parallax catalog for stars within @xmath190 pc over its ten - year lifetime .",
    "it is expected to provide a volume - limited sample out to @xmath36 pc suitable for studies of brown dwarf stars and cool white dwarfs . the extragalactic and galactic stellar science ( eggs ) project will provide a proper motion catalog for @xmath192 stars , whose precision reaches @xmath193 .",
    "this astrometric database will be a goldmine for white dwarf searches , especially in the halo , via reduced proper motion diagrams .",
    "the astrometric grid established by panstarrs also will comprise a faint object reference catalog for higher precision but sparser surveys such as gaia .    in a sense , panstarrs is a pilot project for the large - aperture synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) project .",
    "the lsst is a proposed ground - based 8.4-meter , 10 square - degree - field telescope that will image the entire sky every three nights in continuous 30-second exposures .",
    "it will open a movie - like window on the sky .",
    "one of the proposed by - products of the data stream is a parallax catalog .",
    "assuming astrometric precision of a few @xmath194as per observation , it has been shown @xcite that short - arc parallaxes can be measured for stars out to 10 pc in a few months of observation .",
    "lsst multi - band photometry will permit the determination of photometric parallaxes , chemical abundances and ages via colors at the turn - off for main - sequence stars at all distances within the galaxy . with a geometric parallax accuracy of 1 milli - arcsecond and exposures reaching @xmath195",
    ", the lsst parallax survey will match the faint - end precision of planned space - based missions like gaia , providing a complete catalog to at least @xmath196 through the half of the galaxy visible from its site in chile .",
    "one of the most - anticipated astrometric surveys will be conducted by the esa satellite gaia @xcite .",
    "it is expected to yield high precision parallaxes as well as proper motions .",
    "the typical accuracy of the parallaxes will be of the order of 26  @xmath194as at @xmath197 , degrading to 600  @xmath194as at @xmath198 .",
    "the measured proper motions will be good to 0.2  mas per year .",
    "gaia will provide multi - color photometry for 1.3 billion stars at @xmath199 .",
    "also , it was expected to measure radial velocities to a few km / s precision to at least @xmath200 @xcite , but recently discovered scattered light problems will probably reduce the performance of radial velocity spectrometer to @xmath197 . in any case , gaia s spectroscopic instrument is specifically designed to work around the near - infrared ca triplet and so will be useless for most white dwarfs .",
    "nevertheless , gaia will generate an unprecedented sample of stars from which to construct the white dwarf luminosity function for all three components of the galaxy .",
    "specifically , it is foreseen that gaia will discover around 400,000 new white dwarfs @xcite . using a population synthesis code",
    "@xcite showed that the disk white dwarf population can be probed out to at least 400  pc and apparent gaia magnitude @xmath201 .",
    "distinguishing between disk and halo white dwarfs will require fairly sophisticated automatic classification algorithms @xcite in addition to the usual reduced proper motion diagrams .",
    "the age of the disk and space density of disk white dwarfs will be well - determined , and hypothetical merger episodes in the disk can be investigated .",
    "however , due to the poor sensitivity of gaia s detectors at red wavelengths , most likely only the bright half of the halo white dwarf luminosity function will be probed @xcite .",

    "table  [ spaced ] shows the local white dwarf space densities for the galactic disk ( top sections ) and halo ( bottom section ) .",
    "also shown in this table are the derived age , when available ( first column ) , the number of stars in the sample ( second column ) , the source ( third column ) and the appropriate reference ( last column ) .",
    "as can be seen , the estimated space densities of disk white dwarfs are fairly consistent  except for the very initial studies . a simple average yields @xmath225  pc@xmath226 .",
    "this estimate is uncertain by at least 10% .",
    "the estimates of the white dwarf number density for the halo population are rather discrepant , but the most recent estimates indicate that the white dwarf number density in the halo is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the disk .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the white dwarf luminosity function also has provided useful independent age determinations for several globular and open clusters @xcite .",
    "these and other investigations of the white dwarf luminosity function in clusters will not be discussed in detail here .",
    "let us mention , however , that clusters provide useful benchmarks for the relative ages of the disk and halo , but they do not span the entire age range of their parent populations .",
    "each of these components is also subject to different influences that can bias the derived luminosity functions . in the halo ,",
    "globular clusters are subject to uncertainties in distance determinations , limiting magnitudes , abundances , mass segregation , tidal stripping , binary interactions , and/or deficiencies in evolutionary models @xcite . in the disk ,",
    "the white dwarf luminosity functions of open clusters sometimes provide ages @xcite that sharply contrast with those derived from main - sequence turn - off ages , if all the energy sources are not properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "clearly there is much left to be done in this area .",
    "the field has advanced in several distinct ways since the first robust white dwarf luminosity function was constructed @xcite .",
    "substantial samples of white dwarfs from the thin and thick disk have been assembled .",
    "convincing samples of halo white dwarfs have been identified , though they still are too small to allow construction of a definitive luminosity function .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity functions for open clusters and globular clusters are beginning to provide useful time markers for the early history of the galaxy .",
    "probably the most significant improvements during the last decade have been in the theoretical models for white dwarfs , which now incorporate more realistic core cooling physics and atmospheric opacities .",
    "in addition , artificial samples of white dwarfs have been constructed that have helped quantify the uncertainties in age and space density derived from the white dwarf luminosity function , and how the precision of these important quantities are related to various binning strategies , sample sizes , population groups , selection biases , among other effects .",
    "certainly , the next decade will see a dramatic increase in the number of known white dwarfs .",
    "more than anything else , this will preserve the status of the white dwarf luminosity function as one of the most important tools for unraveling the origin and evolution of the galaxy .",

    "<S> white dwarfs are the final remnants of low- and intermediate - mass stars . their evolution is essentially a cooling process that lasts for @xmath0  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> their observed properties provide information about the history of the galaxy , its dark matter content and a host of other interesting astrophysical problems . </S>",
    "<S> examples of these include an independent determination of the past history of the local star formation rate , identification of the objects responsible for the reported microlensing events , constraints on the rate of change of the gravitational constant , and upper limits to the mass of weakly interacting massive particles . to carry on these tasks the essential observational tools are the luminosity and mass functions of white dwarfs , whereas the theoretical tools are the evolutionary sequences of white dwarf progenitors , and the corresponding white dwarf cooling sequences . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the observed white dwarf luminosity function is the key manifestation of the white dwarf cooling theory , although other relevant ingredients are needed to compare theory and observations . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the recent attempts to empirically determine the white dwarf luminosity function for the different galactic populations . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the biases that may affect its interpretation . finally , we elaborate on the theoretical ingredients needed to model the white dwarf luminosity function , paying special attention to the remaining uncertainties , and we comment on some applications of the white dwarf cooling theory . </S>",
