    "deciphering galaxy spectra is important to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "prominent absorption features of galaxy spectra are widely used to study galaxy properties , because they reflect the average surface gravities , effective temperatures and metallicities of stellar components .",
    "the behavior of spectral features in some galaxies in terms of sodium has received much attention as it has become known that some galaxies show enhanced   doublet strengths at 5890 and 5896   and 1  doublet strengths at 8183 and 8195 .",
    "index is one of the strong absorption features of optical spectra , while 1   is one of the most prominent features in the near - ir ( nir ) spectral range .",
    "numerous studies have been performed over the last three decades to understand these lines .",
    "it is now generally recognized that these lines are affected by the choice of an initial mass function ( imf ) , because these lines are strong in stars with a mass of less than 0.3m@xmath1 .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the  feature is more sensitive to na - enhancement ( [ na / fe ] ) than gravity , and it can also be affected by the interstellar medium ( ism ) . furthermore , both  and 1  absorption features are sensitive to age and metallicity .",
    "what , then , causes  excess objects ( hereafter neos ) ?",
    "the mechanism of   excess has been debated .",
    "one of the leading hypotheses is that  excess is related to the ism , even though it is unclear what the dominant process is : galactic - scale gaseous outflows ( galactic wind ) in actively star - forming galaxies or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity .",
    "it is well known that galactic winds are ubiquitous in star - forming galaxies @xcite , and @xcite argued that  absorption arises from cool gas in the disk , which is entrained in galactic wind .",
    "in contrast , @xcite investigated the properties of  line strengths in a sample of radio galaxies and concluded that agn activity plays an important role in powering the outflow / heating phase of the feedback cycle .",
    "another candidate is metal abundance .",
    "the discovery of non - solar abundance patterns in early - type galaxies was first made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found extreme enhancement of  and  features with respect to calcium and iron peaks , and concluded that this was a result of a higher metal abundance .",
    "later , @xcite measured the nai , caii triplet , tio and feh features of 14 early - type galaxies and confirmed that these features are associated with metal abundance ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite also claimed that strong na features are caused by an overabundance of [ na / fe ] ( see also worthey , ingermann & serven 2011 ) .",
    "the latest compelling mechanistic theory is that of variation of the imf .",
    "the stellar imf is usually considered a universal function , but the possibility of a non - universal imf has been raised by several authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the first observational attempts to constrain the low - mass portion of the imf was made by @xcite .",
    "they compared the observed line strengths of some imf sensitive lines such as nai and tio in the centers of m31 , m32 and m81 with the population synthesis models and claimed a substantial fractional contribution by dwarf stars to the integrated light of galaxies .",
    "@xcite also measured the strengths of 1   and tio in the centers of m31 and m32 and concluded that the imf is equal to that of the galactic disk .",
    "however , @xcite argued for a bottom - heavy ( dwarf - rich ) imf , despite the fact that their results were also based on the 1  line strengths in m31 and m32 .",
    "indeed , it is a challenge to estimate the number of low - mass stars from an integrated spectrum , because low - mass stars are too faint to have a strong influence on the integrated spectrum .",
    "the debate over imf variation , however , was reopened by @xcite .",
    "they found an anti - correlation between the strength of the caii triplet region at 8500  and velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies and concluded that bottom - heavy imfs are favored ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported observing the near - infrared 1  doublet in the spectra of massive early - type galaxies , and claimed that this excess can be explained by the bottom - heavy imf ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if correct , massive early - type galaxies should possess relatively more low - mass stars , and this would affect the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath10 ) of galaxies .",
    "@xcite claimed that there was systematic variation in the imf in early - type galaxies as a function of stellar _",
    "m / l _ ratios based on detailed dynamical modeling of atlas@xmath11 early - type galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the expected maximum slope of the imf is about 2.8 ( x@xmath2@xmath122.8 ) , which is lower than that proposed by @xcite , and there are many high velocity dispersion galaxies that prefer a salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "three origins of  excess have been hypothesized : ( 1 ) the ism , ( 2 ) metallicity and ( 3 ) a bottom - heavy stellar imf . to determine which of the above is correct , we explore the properties of neos in the redshift range 0.00@xmath3@xmath4@xmath30.08 from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with spectral measurements retrieved from @xcite .",
    "almost all previous studies have focused on either early - type or late - type galaxies .",
    "however , it is important to investigate  excess according to galaxy morphology .",
    "the novelty of this paper is that we simultaneously inspect images to identify the morphology of galaxies and explore the photometric and spectroscopic properties of sample galaxies based on homogeneous data sets .",
    "therefore , the catalogue presented here is a useful reference sample of neos with morphological information .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the  feature of galaxies . in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly summarize the photometric and spectroscopic data and describe the sample and our method for selecting neos .",
    "the properties of early - type and late - type neos are presented in sections  [ sec : results_etg ] and [ sec : results_ltg ] , respectively . finally , we discuss the origin of neos in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    ".summary of sampling criteria [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : all_sample ] ( the full table is available in the online version of the paper .",
    "a portion of the table is shown here for guidance regarding form and content . )",
    "+    *  notes .",
    "*    most importantly , assuming that our early - type neos are `` @xmath9-enhanced '' , `` metal - rich '' and `` na - enhanced '' without considering imf variation , we found plausible parameters ( [ @xmath9/fe]@xmath20.3 , [ z / h]@xmath20.3 and [ na / fe]@xmath20.3 ) that reproduced the observed ,  and  line strengths ( see black filled star and red filled circle in figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "a possible criticism is that the hypothesis of na - enhancement to explain the na excess is an _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption . however , several studies have pointed out the presence of na - enhanced stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we stress that na - enhancement also causes an increase in nai strength and counteracts the effect of the bottom - heavy imf .",
    "our analysis does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a bottom - heavy imf .",
    "we simply report that  lines , though measured at a much higher s / n ratio than 1 , are too strong in many massive early - type galaxies to be accounted for by the same bottom - heavy imf models that @xcite used to match the 1  lines . while na enhancement is discussed here",
    ", we have not fully explored its effects on other line indices ( e.g.  and ) .",
    "this will be investigated in depth in a forthcoming paper based on new stellar population synthesis models .",
    "one more thing to pay attention to is the near - ir ( nir ) flux .",
    "@xcite claimed that such bottom - heavy imfs would yield redder nir colors . in another forthcoming companion paper",
    ", we will also explore the multi - band ( including nir ) photometric properties of neos .",
    "ism and dust could also increase  line strength .",
    "however , we classified the dust - lane galaxies as peculiar galaxies during the visual inspection stage ( see section  [ sec : visual ] ) .",
    "notwithstanding that diffuse dust is essentially invisible in optical imaging , our ordinary early - type neos are at least free from clumpy dust and emission lines ( see figure  [ fig : bpt_etg ] and table  [ tab : bpt_etg ] ) .",
    "furthermore , there was no correlation between   values from the ossy catalogue and , at least for ordinary early - type neos , and the  values of ordinary early - type neos were nearly zero ( see figure  [ fig : ebv_etg ] ) .",
    "this implies that the ism and/or dust does not enhance the  line strength of ordinary early - type neos in a significant way .",
    "nevertheless , a study of the presence and properties of the ism in early - type neos is desirable because it is known that a significant fraction of early - type galaxies contain some cool ism and dust ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the mechanism for  excess in late - type neos , including a small fraction of peculiar early - type neos that showed very similar trends to the late - type neos , appears to be different from that for the majority of early - type neos .",
    "in contrast to early - type neos , enhanced star formation was indicated both by strong h@xmath8 absorption line strengths and by the higher fraction that were classified as star - forming based on bpt diagnostics .",
    "an intriguing property worth discussing here is that late - type neos generally have weak   and  line strengths . in that sense",
    ", these galaxies could correspond to objects like ngc3032 and 4150 observed in the course of the sauron survey ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) that experienced recent star formation @xcite .",
    "these characteristics may be caused by young stars @xcite .",
    "the fact that late - type neos have extra young stars is not directly related to  line strength , because this would reduce  line strength rather than enhance it .",
    "however , the presence of star formation and nuclear activity in these galaxies implies the availability of gas and dust , which can impact  line strength .",
    "furthermore , we found that our late - type neos tended to have larger  values than the late - type control sample ( see figure  [ fig : ebv_ltg ] ) in contrast to early - type neos .",
    "we thus conclude that early - type ( excluding a small fraction of peculiar early - type neos ) and late - type neos have completely different mechanisms underlying their enhanced   strengths .",
    "the origin of  excess in early - type galaxies is not clear yet , but it is clear that early - type neos have na - enhanced populations .",
    "the effects of na - enhancement on individual line strengths will be elucidated in a companion paper . meanwhile ,  line strengths in late - type neos and a small fraction of peculiar early - type neos are highly contaminated by the ism and/or dust . to facilitate follow - up observations of these exciting objects , we provide a catalogue of all  excess objects presented in this paper in table  [ tab : all_sample ] .",
