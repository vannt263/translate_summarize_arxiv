    "the final state of the gravitational collapse of a massive star is one of the challenges in classical general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "a significant contribution has been to show that , under reasonable initial conditions , the spacetime describing the collapse process would inevitably admit singularities @xcite .",
    "these singularities , can either be hidden behind an event horizon or visible to distant observers . in the former , a black hole forms as the end product of a continual collapse process , as hypothesized by the cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews on the conjecture ) .",
    "the latter are classified as naked singularities , whose existence in gr has been established under a variety of specific circumstances and for different models , with matter content of various types , e.g. scalar fields @xcite , perfect fluids @xcite , imperfect fluids @xcite and null strange quark fluids @xcite . the analysis has also been taken to wider gravitational settings , such as @xmath2 theories @xcite , lovelock gravity @xcite ( see also @xcite for some recent reviews ) and hypothesized quantum gravity theories @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting line of research because , the possible discovery of naked singularities may provide us with an opportunity to extract information from physics beyond trans - planckian regimes @xcite , see e.g. ( @xcite for the possibility of observationally detecting naked singularities).[ff ]    it is therefore well motivated to consider other realistic gravitational theories whose geometrical attributes ( not present in gr ) may affect the final asymptotic stages of the collapse . more concretely ,",
    "could ingredients mimicking spin effects ( associated with fermions ) potentially influence the final fate of a collapse scenario ?",
    "in fact , if spin effects are explicitly present then gr will no longer be the theory to describe the collapse dynamics . in gr , the energy - momentum couples to the metric . however ,",
    "when the spin of particles is introduced into the framework , it is expected to couple to a geometrical quantity related to the rotational degrees of freedom in the spacetime .",
    "this point of view suggests a spacetime which is non - riemannian , namely generalizations of gr induced from the explicit presence of matter with such spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "one such framework , which will allow non - trivial dynamical consequences to be extracted is the einstein - cartan ( ec ) theory @xcite where the metric and torsion determine the geometrical structure of spacetime .",
    "the torsion can be interpreted as caused by microscopic effects , e.g. , by fermionic fields which are not taken explicitly into account @xcite .    within the context of ec theories",
    ", it has been shown that considering the induced repulsive effects extracted from ( averaged ) spin interactions , the big - bang singularity can be replaced by a non - singular bounce , before which the universe was contracting and halts at a minimum but finite radius @xcite . however",
    ", a curvature singularity as the final fate of a gravitational collapse process can still occur even if explicit spin - torsion and spin - spin repulsive interactions @xcite are taken into account .",
    "the argument that has been put forward is that since photons neither produce nor interact with the spacetime torsion , the causal structure of an ec manifold , determined by light signals , is the same as in gr .",
    "hence the singularity theorems in gr can be generalized to the ec theory by taking into account a combined energy - momentum tensor which would include , by means of some suitable averaging procedure , spin contributions @xcite .",
    "the results conveyed within this paper are twofold .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric configuration in the presence of a negative cosmological constant @xcite whose matter content is assumed to be a homogeneous weyssenhoff fluid @xcite that collapses under its own gravity . on the one hand , the first class of our solutions is shown to evolve towards a spacetime singularity where the role of the negative cosmological constant is to set up the gravitational attraction through a positive pressure term .",
    "then , as the collapse proceeds , a repulsive pressure computed from averaged spin - spin and spin - torsion interactions , balances the inward pressure , preventing trapped surfaces from forming in the later stages . thus , the resulting singularity could be at least locally naked .",
    "moreover , it is pertinent to point out that our analysis shows that , depending on the spin and energy density parameters , trapped surfaces can either be formed or avoided . on the other hand ,",
    "second class of solutions suggest that the spin contributions to the field equations may generate a bounce that averts the formation of a spacetime singularity .",
    "let us furthermore note that , in contrast to some alternative theories of gravity e.g. , the gauss - bonnet theory in which the misner - sharp energy is modified @xcite , our approach will involve only the manipulation of the matter content .",
    "hence the misner - sharp energy which is the key factor that determines the dynamics of the apparent horizon is defined in the same manner as that in gr @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is then as follows . in section ( [ eqm ] )",
    "we present a brief review on the background field equations of the ec theory in the presence of a weyssenhoff fluid and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "section ( [ sol ] ) provides a family of solutions , some of which represent a collapse scenario that leads to a spacetime singularity within a finite amount of time . in section ( [ dah ] )",
    "we study the dynamics of apparent horizon and induced spin effects on the formation of trapped surfaces and show that trapped surface avoidance can occur for a subset of collapse settings .",
    "we examine the curvature strength of the naked singularity in [ strength ] and show that the singularity is gravitationally strong in the sense of tipler @xcite . a second class of solutions exhibiting a bounce is presented in ( [ nss ] ) where we show how the presence of a spin fluid could affect the dynamics of the apparent horizon . in section ( [ exterior ] )",
    "we present a suitable solution for an exterior region and discuss therein the matching between interior and exterior regions .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section ( [ con ] ) .",
    "the action for the ec theory can be written in the form @xcite s = d^4x \\{(+2)+_m } = d^4x \\{+l_m } , [ action ] where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar constructed from the general affine connection @xmath4 and can be expressed , in general , as a function of independent background fields , i.e. , the metric field @xmath5 and the affine connection .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the contorsion tensor defined as [ contortion ] k^ _  = ( t^ _  -t _  ^  - t _  ^  ) , with the spacetime torsion tensor @xmath7 being geometrically defined as the antisymmetric part of the general affine connection [ teq ] t^ _  = ^ _  -^ _  . and @xmath8 is the matter lagrangian ; @xmath9 is the cosmological constant .",
    "we take the metric signature and @xmath9 throughout the equations but in plotting the diagrams we set the units so that @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ] as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of torsion in the macroscopic structure of spacetime can , theoretically , be attributed to microscopic fermionic matter fields with spin - angular momentum degrees of freedom . in this paper",
    ", we take the matter part of the action to be described by a weyssenhoff fluid @xcite which macroscopically is a continuous medium but also conveys features that can be suitably associated with the ( averaged ) spinor degrees of freedom of microscopic matter fields .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that with the assumption of the frenkel condition ( also known as the weyssenhoff condition ) , the setup may be equivalently described by means of an effective fluid in a plain gr setting where the effective energy momentum tensor contains additional ( spin induced ) terms @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the lagrangian for the matter content can be subsequently decomposed as _",
    "the lagrangian @xmath14 contains the induced effects of a spinning fluid which can be written in terms of a perfect fluid contribution and a characteristic spin part @xcited . ] .",
    "@xmath15 conveys a minimal coupling of a spinor axial current with torsion @xcite can be associated to a chiral interaction that corresponds to the coupling of contorsion to the massless fermion fields due to a massless dirac lagrangian in a curved background . ] .",
    "therefore , we may write [ axial ] _ ac = j^s _ , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to the ( averaged ) spinor axial current and axial torsion vector , respectively is defined by @xmath18=2g^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , @xmath19 is a chiral dirac matrix , @xmath20 is a fermion field , @xmath21 is the conjugate fermion field and @xmath22 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor . ] .",
    "varying the action with respect to the contorsion together with using ( [ contortion ] ) gives @xcite [ constraint ] t^+2g^=^2 ^ , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the spin angular momentum tensor given by ^:=:=^_ac+^_sf .",
    "moreover , considering the decomposition of the spin angular momentum as @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath27 is the antisymmetric spin density tensor representing the effective source of torsion . in the ec theory , in contrast to the metric",
    ", the torsion is not really a dynamical field ; the left hand side of equation ( [ constraint ] ) contains no derivatives of the torsion tensor and indeed appears as a purely algebraic equation .",
    "torsion can therefore be eliminated by replacing it with the spin density @xmath28 and hence implying a modification to the einstein field equations . using the frenkel condition , @xmath29 , the torsion constraint equation ( [ constraint ] )",
    "may be rewritten in the form [ tconstraint ] t^=-^2(2^j_-s^u^ ) . at this point",
    "it is useful to show how the weyssenhoff fluid can fit the frenkel condition .",
    "more precisely , this condition results in an algebraic relationship between the spin density tensor and torsion as t_=t^ _",
    "= u^s _ , which can also be retrieved directly from the formalism proposed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , by virtue of the frenkel condition , this means that the only remaining degrees of freedom of the torsion are the traceless components of the torsion tensor .",
    "furthermore , the axial torsion vector can be written , with the assistance of equations ( [ contortion ] ) and ( [ tconstraint ] ) , as [ axialvector ] s_=_(2k^)=12 ^ 2 j_+^2_s^u^. it is now straightforward to obtain the dynamical equations of motion , varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the dynamical field @xmath30 which can be written as [ geq ] g_&-&g_-k^ _",

    "in this section , we will find a class of collapse solutions which lead to the formation of a spacetime singularity . if the spacetime is assumed to have fewer symmetries ( that is , inhomogeneities or anisotropies ) , there is a paucity of physically reasonable exact solutions available owing to the intrinsic difficulties .",
    "we therefore restrict the discussion to a homogeneous and isotropic interior line element , representing the flrw geometry @xcite [ metric ] ds^2=dt^2-a^2(t)dr^2-r^2(t , r)d^2 , where @xmath37 is the physical radius of the collapsing matter , with @xmath38 being the scale factor and @xmath39 the standard line element on the unit 2-sphere . the field equations for the above metric read 3h^2-&=&^4+_sf(t)_eff(t),[fes00 ] + -2 - 3h^2+&=&^4+p_sf(t)p_eff(t),[fes11 ] where @xmath40 is the rate of collapse .",
    "since we are interested in a continual collapse process , @xmath41 must be negative .",

    "it is plausible to assume that the fermions participating in the collapse process behave as ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "thus the number density ( @xmath43 ) of a fermionic gas , satisfying the fermi - dirac distribution , can be approximated by @xmath44 , see @xcite for more details .",
    "so the squares of the spin density and the axial current , which are proportional to @xmath45 @xcite , depend on the scale factor as and @xmath46 are the source parameters for the squared spin density and axial current respectively , and should not be confused with their initial values defined as @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]",

    "the singularity is covered within an event horizon if trapped surfaces emerge early enough before the singularity formation and may be visible if the apparent horizon , which is the outermost boundary of trapped surfaces , fails to form or is delayed during the collapse process .",

    "the initial data of the collapsing configuration can be chosen so that the effective pressure is positive at initial epoch , the moment at which the matter distribution begins to collapse at rest , @xmath74 .",
    "this can be achieved if [ conpospressure ] c_0(1+w)>na_i^n+3(1+w)>0 . having the above condition satisfied",
    ", we see that the first and second terms in the right hand side of ( [ peff ] ) dominate the third one ( for @xmath75 ) and the total pressure becomes negative for @xmath76 and @xmath67 .",
    "we require @xmath77 so that the singularity time is real .",
    "therefore , we can deduce that at later stages of the collapse the failure of trapped surfaces to form is accompanied by a negative pressure @xcite , which is indeed produced due to the fermion condensation . on the other hand , if @xmath71 and @xmath78 , which satisfies the condition for trapped surface formation , the pressure can be initially set to be positive and remains positive up to the final stages of the collapse .",
    "although the pressure is allowed to take on negative values , the collapse process will be physically reasonable if the weak energy condition is preserved throughout the collapse .",
    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) states that the energy density as measured by any local observer is non - negative .",
    "thus , along any non - spacelike vector , the following conditions have to be satisfied [ wecrhop ] _",

    "each point from this space represents a collapse process that can be either led to a spacetime singularity or a non - singular bounce . determining the suitable ranges for this set of initial data is not straightforward and so , for the sake of clarity , we have to deal with the two - dimensional subspaces by fixing four of the above parameters .",
    "however , we could infer that among the allowed sets of the initial data we can always pick up those for which trapped surfaces are prevented ( in singular solutions ) during the collapse scenario , ( see the regions in figure [ fig1 ] ) , where we have fixed the same initial values for energy density and scale factor . * depending on the initial value of energy density and the source parameters related to spin - spin contact interaction and axial current , singular ( @xmath77 and @xmath84 ) and non - singular ( @xmath85 and @xmath84 ) solutions can be found . in the former",
    "the singularity occurs sooner than the case in which the spin correction term is neglected ( see the left panel in figure [ sftb ] ) . for the non - singular scenario , the collapse process halts at a finite value of the scale factor and then turns to expansion .",
    "it is worth mentioning that besides the model presented here , non - singular scenarios have been reported within models of @xmath2 theories of gravity in palatini @xcite and metric @xcite formalisms , generalized teleparallel theories of gravity @xcite , bouncing in brane models @xcite and modified gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite ( see also @xcite for recent review ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that a quantized neutral scalar field minimally coupled to classical gravitational field may avoid the singularity .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , beside the frenkel condition we employed here , we could consider the possibility of relaxing it , therefore allowing to take a more general matter content .",
    "if such a modification is employed , then the number of degrees of freedom of the torsion tensor would increase , seemingly bringing a more complicated setting to deal with .",
    "finally , we would like to present a few possible additional subsequent lines of exploration .",
    "although being a wider set - up with respect to gr , it could be fruitful to generalize action ( [ action ] ) . more concretely , replacing the cosmological constant by some scalar matter .",
    "this would allow for the establishment of limits for the dominance of any matter component ( and associated intrinsic effects ) towards a concrete gravitational collapse outcome where , for example , bosonic and fermionic matter would be competing . perhaps more challenging would be to employ a weyssenhoff fluid description that could have different features whether we use @xmath216 fermion or a rarita - schwinger field with @xmath217 spin angular momentum .",
    "the gravitational theory of such latter particles in the presence of torsion has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the authors are grateful to d. malafarina and r. goswami for useful discussions and to f. w. hehl for helpful correspondence .",
    "a. ranjbar also would like to thank f. canfora and j. zanelli for their interesting comments .",
