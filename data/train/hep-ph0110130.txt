    "since i happen to present the last talk at this conference , let me start with some historic remarks , on the early days of our field in general and the role of helmut satz in particular .",
    "i know helmut longer than the topic of conference , `` statistical qcd '' , existed : we first met i think in 1975 in dubna , a year after my ph.d .. already then i have been stronhly influenced by his general style , which i would characterize as `` forceful but kind '' .",
    "( at this meeting he has demonstrated the same qualities once again , as the chairman of the last session , saving myself from a cascade of difficult questions after this talk . )",
    "speaking of our field , let me define it as the intercept of ( i ) the theory of hot / dense matter @xmath6 from the usual hadronic matter ( such as nuclear matter ) ; with ( ii ) the phenomenology of high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "of course the first use of thermodynamics for hadronic collisions were suggested 50 years ago by _ fermi _ @xcite .",
    "soon after _ landau _",
    "@xcite argued that hydrodynamics should also be applicable , provided the system is _ macroscopically large _ , its size @xmath7 is much larger than a micro scale @xmath8 , the mean free path .",
    "( below i will return to the fundamental question of our field , whether the system created in heavy ion collisions does or does not satisfy this criterium . ) when the first hadronic resonance , @xmath9 , has just been discovered , _ landau and s.z.belenkij_ @xcite promtly introduced the `` resonance gas '' , supporteed by the beth - ulenbeck result for the second virial coefficient .",
    "_ hagedorn _ @xcite in 1960 s developed this idea into dual bootstrap approach for resonances , and introduced his famous limited t. as it was understood later , it is indeed a maximal t in a _",
    "hadronic phase _ in which there is confinement and qcd strings .",
    "it was very important that from the start hagedorn and others made practical applications of the statistical model to various hadronic reactions the thermodynamics indeed works remarcably well , provided ( i ) one uses microcanonical approach for strangeness etc ; ( ii ) the freeze - out happens at fixed desnity , not volume .",
    "both of them have surfaced now again . ] .    of course in the early 70 s , when qcd has been discovered , its ideas were soon applied to hot / dense matter . based on asymptotic freedom , collins and",
    "perry @xcite suggested that the high t and/or density matter should be close to the ideal gas .",
    "the first perturbative corrections were evaluated @xcite . the part of gluonic polarization tensor due to high t @xcite ( unlike that due to virtual gluonic loops ) @xmath10 the charge : thus the name of this new phase , _ quark - gluon plasma _ , qgp .",
    "its excitations are quasiparticles similar to `` plasmons '' etc of the usual plasma .",
    "furthermore , it was found in @xcite that static magnetic field is not screened : thus the infrared divergences and other non - perturbative phenomena survive in the magnetic sector .",
    "first resummations of ( what was later called ) hot thermal loops into a plasmon term have also been done @xcite by the end of 1970 s .",
    "( its consistent application to many other problems have been worked out by braaten , pisarski and others a decade later . )",
    "my other paper @xcite addressed such practical questions as new flavor , photon and dilepton production from qgp , as well as the first take on the @xmath11 suppression is not even bound .",
    "however later , satz , kharzeev and others have also worked out gluonic excitation to continuum .",
    "] , by gluon excitation similar to photoeffect .    by the end of 70",
    "s helmut was the first to realize that in order for this field to be shaped one has to take it all together : he called the first quark matter conference - the famous bielefeld meeting of 1980 ( soon reinforced by the next one in 1982 ) - which have defined the field and created our community .",
    "since at the time i still was , so to say , in a confined phase , i could not attend these meetings . as i also felt that something should be done at that moment",
    ", i wrote the first review article @xcite in which available theory results were combined with potential applications to high energy collisions .",
    "let me start with general remarks about the phases of qcd",
    ". basically , starting from the hadronic phase there are three directions to go : ( i ) _ high t _ leading to qgp , the perturbative phase without any condensates .",
    "( ii ) _ high density _ direction , which leads us to very rich world dominated by quark pairing providing a set of color superconducting phases , with broken color group , sometimes with broken chiral symmetry or even broken parity .",
    "( iii ) _ increasing number of light quarks @xmath12 _ which brings another strange conformal world , without condensates but with the infrared fixed point .",
    "very few studies have been done , on the lattice @xcite and with instantons ( see @xcite ) : both have indicated that the critical @xmath12 can be as low as 7 or 5 .    all this large variety of phases ( including of course the hadronic phase we live in ) and their boundaries can be understood with remarcably small set of dynamical tools .",
    "basically , if one is interested in asymptotically large @xmath13 , the one - gluon exchange should be used . if not , the _ instanton - induced _",
    "thooft lagrangian is enough .",
    "it generates attraction in @xmath14 different channels : ( i ) _ quark - antiquark _ , leading to chiral symmetry breaking ; ( ii ) _ quark - quark _ channel leading to color superconductivity ; and ( iii ) attraction between _ instanton and anti - instanton _ , mediated by light quarks , which leads to their pairing in qgp and conformal phase .",
    "the competition of these three attractions defines the phase boundaries .",
    "let me now make a quick update on recent news , starting with the t direction .",
    "important work by the bielefeld group ( see laermann , this proceedings ) have fixed the critical mass of the quark , in the case when it is the same for 3 flavors .",
    "its value indicate that in qcd we would nearly certainly have a cross - over , not the first order transition .    addressing the fate of this cross - over line along the @xmath15 direction , fodor and katz @xcite",
    "have found the first numerical evidences that the location of the critical endpoint e is at @xmath16 , see fig.[chemfreeze](a ) .",
    "going further to the high density we find intense theoretical activity .",
    "the main news is the `` stress '' which is provided by the non - zero strange quark mass on the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase leads to spontaneous breaking of the @xmath17 , with the non - zero _ kaon condensate _ , as first shown by bedaque and schafer @xcite .",
    "more details on the resulting phase diagram in the plane of chemical potentials for baryon and electric charge has been provided by kaplan ad reddy @xcite : the most surprising feature is that the recovery of pure cfl phase happens only at extremely high density , at @xmath18 of the order of millions of gev .",
    "( one will find details on it in t.schafers talk in this proceedings . )    the second time in this field there were two papers from the stony brook and the ( now ) mit teams , submitted to hep - ph on the same day : both are the first attempts to `` try the ice '' by looking into possible _",
    "crystalline phases of quark matter_. this time however the content of the papers are rather different .",
    "rapp , zahed and myself @xcite have looked at frozen @xmath19 ( or sigma ) field with non - zero momentum : a phenomenon similar to the so called pierls instability in 1d and overhauser spin waves in 2d .",
    "we found that given very strong pairing force , it may well compete with the 2-flavor color superconductivity at @xmath20 .",
    "alford , bowers and rajagopal @xcite have considered a different crystal , in which @xmath21 ( or diquark ) condensate has the non - zero momentum : it is similar to the so called loff phase proposed ( but not observed yet ) for ordinary superconductors .",
    "its tentative place is a narrow region along the border between 2- and 3-flavor - like superconducting phases .",
    "there are multiple works on unusual properties of excitations .",
    "let me single out two nice papers by son , stephanov and zhitnitsky @xcite who have addressed the @xmath22 and instantons at very high @xmath15 .",
    "they have shown this to be the first example of relatively simple `` instanton liquid '' , in this case a 4-d dilute coulomb plasma with the @xmath22 being the exchange field which gets massive due to the debye mechanism .",
    "they have also shown that in this phase there can exist metastable domain walls made of the @xmath22 field : maybe bubbles made of such membranes can ocasionally be produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "as shown in several talks at this conference , statistical description of particle composition which worked well before also does so at rhic . the only new number to know is @xmath23 : the resulting predictions agree with measured particle ratios quite well .",
    "however , _ does the success of statistical description imply that we deal with macrosopically large systems ?",
    "_ not really : the same thermal models provide nearly equally good description of hadronic yields from very low energy reactions like @xmath24 annihilation at rest to high energy @xmath25 annihilation into hadrons . in the latter case",
    "we are quite sure the system is rather dilute : and thus excellent predictions of the thermal model here remains ( a long standing ) puzzle .",
    "fitting the matter composition from particular data set , one gets a point at the @xmath26 diagram .",
    "* what kind of pattern one should eventually see when many such points are collected ? *",
    "cleymans and redlich @xcite have suggested a smooth chemical freeze - out line at @xmath26 plane : they have empirically shown that it is nearly a _ semi - circle _ approximately correspondnf to energy per particle e / n about 1 gev .",
    "however i would suggest a different picture ( see fig .",
    "[ chemfreeze](a ) ) , namely _ two crossing lines _ , ( i ) the qgp phase boundary ; and ( ii ) chemical freeze - out line defined by hadronic rates .",
    "their nature is quite different : the first is a place of rapid changes in thermodynamics , the second is of kinetic nature and depends on things like expansion rate , and is in principle different for different nuclei and impact parameters .",
    "although at the phase diagram it looks like two lines are nearly parallel and their crossing would be difficult to detect , it looks more promising in other observables",
    ". strangeness content is one of them : see the @xmath27 ratio in fig.[chemfreeze](b ) , in which the change of behavior is really striking .",
    "my prediction is that instead of a round maximum shown ( corresponding to this cemi - circle ) , we should see instead a peak sue to the crossing of two lines discontinuities has been demonstrated previously by m.gazdzicki et al , hep - ph/0006236 . ] .",
    "taking more data around the maximum , which we may call `` the strangest point '' marked s in fig.[chemfreeze](a ) is therefore very interesting and directly linked to the qgp phase boundary .",
    "( a ) a compillations of chemical freeze - out points on the phase diagram temerature t ( mev ) versus the baryon chemical potential @xmath18 ( mev ) .",
    "the dotted line is the cleymans - redlich `` semi - circle '' e / n= 1 gev .",
    "the dashed and solid line show crossover and 1-st order phase boundary , the dash - dotted line is the kinetic chemical freezeout line in the hadronic phase . the crossing ( marked s ) is the `` strangest point '' corresponding to the maximum in fig.(b ) .",
    "( b ) the compillation of data on @xmath27 ratio ( p.b.munzinger et al , hep - ph/0106066 ) , the curve corresponds to predictions of the statistical model _ on cleymans - redlich `` semi - circle''_. , title=\"fig : \" ]   ( a ) a compillations of chemical freeze - out points on the phase diagram temerature t ( mev ) versus the baryon chemical potential @xmath18 ( mev ) .",

    "the anti - hyperon production is not strongly suppressed by annihilation , and their spectra show the same shape as hyperon s , even a small @xmath4 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath28 as well . logically speaking , there are two options : ( i ) either there is no interaction after chemical freeze - out ( as rafelski argued ) ; or ( ii ) there exist back reactions , compensating for the annihilated anti - baryons .",
    "rapp and myself as well as c.greiner @xcite have shown that ( contrary to disbelief of many ) the rates of those are quite sufficient to nearly completely compensate the annihilation .",
    "the key element here is the well _ pion overpopulation _ phenomenon : after chemical equilibration point ( at which @xmath29 is set to zero ) , the number of pions is conserved while t goes down : it means that @xmath29 grows , reaching about 70 mev .",
    "since annihilation @xmath30 include @xmath31 pions , the inverse rate gets a big help from @xmath32 factor .",
    "`` life after chemical freeze - out '' has been recently studied by derek teaney @xcite , as part of hydro studies to be discussed below . incorporating non - zero @xmath15 s for @xmath33 species",
    ", he calculated the thermodynamics of the resulting chemically non - equilibrium resonance gas .",
    "( as above for pions , particle numbers per entropy are kept the same as at the chemical freeze - out point . )",
    "it turns out @xmath34 ( and thus hydro ) hardly change , but @xmath35 ( and thus spectra ) did changed quite a lot . remarkably , new eos of the resonance gas seem to match that of rqmd : if it is used for description of the hadronic phase , the results no longer depend on where transition from hydro to rqmd takes place .",
    "according to landau , a decisive test of the macroscopic behavior is @xmath36 flows . _",
    "is this criterium satisfied by elementary pp or @xmath25 collisions ?",
    "_ with appearence of the first multiparticle production data from accelerators in 1970 s , the answer seemed affirmative at first @xcite,@xcite , but more accurate @xmath37 spectra from isr had shown @xcite that in this case there is no sign of transverse expansion of matter .",
    "beccatini at this conference have shown fits to more modern high energy data , which indicate something like transverse flow , but with the velocity only @xmath38 or so , much less than hydro predicts ( and the rhic data show ) , @xmath39 .",
    "early bevalac data have displayed collective phenomena such as directed flow and `` squeeze - out '' , and hydro description had been attempted @xcite .",
    "eventually however , it has been also concluded that at such energies ( @xmath40 ) the nn mean free path @xmath41 is not small enough compared to nuclear size @xmath42 to justify it .",
    "hadronic cascade models took the lead from that time on , and ( such as event generators rqmd we use ) have provided good description of ags and sps data . at ags and even more so at sps , much stronger collective expansion effects have been observed . at sps",
    "the mean transverse velocity @xmath43 reached by matter is about 1/2 .",
    "although it has been successfully described hydrodynamically @xcite , these works did not shed much light at the eos of very dense matter becauseat ags / sps conditions most of the acceleration happens at late times , in hadronic matter driven by relativistic pions .",
    "so , its hydro description is just `` dual '' to hadronic cascades .",
    "the decisive shift occured when @xmath44 collisions at high energies have been studied experimentally at sps and rhic , and theoretically , by our group @xcite , as well as by u.heinz and collaborators @xcite .",
    "based on these works and rhic data , we can now see that we are finally approaching the macrosopic regime .",
    "_ finally , we got a bang , not fizzle .",
    "_    i would concetrate here on our last paper from the set @xcite , in which systematic study of radial and elliptic flow has been made , with detailed predictions of their energy , centrality and @xmath4 dependence as a function of eos ( the @xmath45 input for hydro ) .",
    "our hydro - to - hadrons ( h2h ) model uses hydro in qgp and `` mixed '' phases , but switch to hadronic cascade ( rqmd ) in the hadronic phase .",
    "thus , in contrast to others , we have _ differential freeze - out _ of different species , which is very important aspect of the calculation .",
    "its comparison with large set of sps and rhic data looks to me very convincing : the model describes radial and elliptic flows in great details .",
    "of course , only few examples can be given here : i selected 2 cases in which the model was not anticipated to work , and surprized us .",

    "the r.h.s . shows our predictions ( both data and model have absolute normalizations : no free parameters ) .",
    "what is unusual about it is that hydro / thermal description seem to work even at the largest measured @xmath4 : so far , no power - like tail due to hard processes is seen ratio much less than 1 . ] .     a comparison of @xmath46 and @xmath47 spectra .",

    "first note that at sps the difference between theory and data is substantial , especially at more peripheral collisions .",
    "however , this difference completely disappears at rhic , where even very peripheral collisions demonstrate large elliptic flow .",
    "another important feature of elliptic flow , also well reproduced by hydro fig.[psbscanv2particip](b ) , is its strong growth with the transverse momentum .    0.2 in   v2 versus impact parameter b , described experimentally by the number of participant nucleons , for rhic star and sps na49 experiments . both are compared to our results , for eos lh8 . , title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]   v2 versus impact parameter b , described experimentally by the number of participant nucleons , for rhic star and sps na49 experiments . both are compared to our results , for eos lh8 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=249,height=249 ] 0.2 in    last but not least : combining all these hydro results , we were able to show that the whole body of data ( i ) can not be described by eos @xmath49 the qcd phase transition ; and that ( ii ) it is best described by eos in which the jump in energy density ( `` latent heat '' ) is about @xmath50 , or @xmath51 .",
    "this happen to be in excellent agreement with the lattice results , which the beilefeld group and others have predicted for years .",
    "heavy ion physics entered a new era when relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory have taken first data in summer 2000 .",
    "these data ( see e.g. @xcite ) have shown that heavy ions collisions ( aa ) at highest energies significantly differ @xmath52 from the hh collisions and the aa collisions at lower ( sps / ags ) energies .",
    "already the very first multiplicity measurements by phobos collaboration have shown that particle production per participant nucleon is no longer constant , as was the case at lower ( sps / ags ) energies , but grows more rapidly .",
    "long - anticipated semi - hard processes have shown up .",
    "if they are perturbative _ `` mini - jets '' _ , cut at scale @xmath53 , the predicted mini - jet multiplicity is expected to be @xmath54 for central auau collisions at @xmath55 .",
    "however , other rhic data have provided serious arguments _ against _ the mini - jet scenario .",
    "those are : ( i ) strong _ collective phenomena _ such as flows desribed above ( ii ) jet quenching : spectra of hadrons at large @xmath4 , especially the @xmath56 spectra from phenix , agree well with hijing for peripheral collisions , but show much smaller yields for central ones . counting from expected cronin effect ( which in pa collisions is about factor 2 )",
    "we see a suppression of about order of magnitude .",
    "it has not been the case at sps and it can only happen if the outgoing high-@xmath4 jets propagate through dense matter , with @xmath57 .",
    "( iii ) furthermore , this estimate is also supported by star data on elliptic asymmetry parameter @xmath58 at large transverse momenta @xmath59 , see @xcite .",
    "note also that the result is consistent with the @xmath60 possible value evaluated from the final entropy at freeze - out , @xmath61 .    in summary",
    ", these data are quite consistent with the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ( or little bang ) scenario in which entropy is produced promptly and subsequent expansion is close to adiabatic expansion of equilibrated hot medium .",
    "how this happened remains an outstanding question .",
    "one option is _ significant reduction of the pqcd cut - off _ relative to @xmath62 expected from pp .",
    "the other is the subject of the next section .",
    "in spite of significant progress related to instanton - induced effects in qcd vacuum and hadrons ( see e.g. review @xcite ) , very little has so far been made toward understanding high energy processes .",
    "this is mostly because it is difficult to translate many of our non - perturbative tools to minkowski space .",
    "the non - perturbative fields in the qcd vacuum ( and inside hadrons ) are not some shapeless objects , with typical size @xmath63 , as was assumed in the 70 s .",
    "instead it is concentrated in @xmath64 instantons , with size @xmath65 , which also generate `` constituent quarks '' of similar size .",
    "when hadrons are boosted to high energies , they become thin disks : and substructure just mentioned makes their partons to be correlated in the transverse plane . furthermore , what is a part of hadronic wave function in one reference frame , becomes the parton - parton interaction in another .",
    "this consideration alone implies importance of the instanton - induced high energy scattering .",
    "we can not describe here long history of the so called soft pomeron , starting from pomeranchuck and gribov in 1960 s .",
    "phenomenologically it is still in very good shape .",
    "where a supercritical pole with the intercept @xmath66 .",
    "perturbative bfkl gluon ladder gives the pqcd version of high energy behavior , with a supercritical pole with the intercept @xmath67 : it seem to work for hard processes , with large @xmath68 .    for long time",
    "people have constructed multi - peripheral models with ladders made of hadrons .",
    "recent story started with kharzeev and levin@xcite who kept t - channel gluons but tried to substitute the gluonic  rungs \" of the bfkl ladder by those with a pair of pions , or sigma meson , to improve it .",
    "they used the gg-@xmath69 non - perturbative vertices known from the low energy theorem .",
    "their estimated value for @xmath9 was close to @xmath70 .",
    "introducing @xmath71 into the problem , i re - analyzed @xcite the contribution of the colorless scalar channel generated by operator @xmath72 , using the gg-@xmath69 and gg@xmath73 couplings determined previously from the calculation of appropriate euclidean correlators , see @xcite .",
    "the result turns out to reduce thos of the kl paper , with @xmath74 only , and pions and glueball contributions being roughly equal .",
    "the next important step has been done by two groups , kharzeev , kovchegov and levin  @xcite and m.nowak , i. zahed and myself  @xcite .",
    "these works considered inelastic processes , with multi - gluon production . basically , instead of the glueball peak at @xmath75 in the cross section @xmath76 in the _ colorless scalar _ channel , these authors argue that a particular @xmath77 object is produced , the @xmath78 .",
    "the cross section as a function of the mass is also believed to have a peak , around 2.5 - 3 gev , with a width given by @xmath79 instability of this configuration .",
    "so , in a way , it is a resonance , although not a hadron due to non - zero color .    hard processes , involving scales @xmath80 are adequately described by pqcd :",
    "the result of parton collisions is their re - scattering , see fig.[processes](a ) .",
    "the multiple production of n partons is suppressed in pqcd by extra powers of @xmath81 .",

    ", width=249 ]    note that not necessarily one pair of gluons collides ( the figure depict 3 * 3 as an example ) , also several gluons are produced in one act .",
    "this happens because of the large field strength of the instanton @xmath90 , which makes processes with any number of gluons of the same orders in g.    furthermore , the intermediate stage of the process ( shown by the horizontal dashed lines ) indicate @xmath91 of the outgoing gluons : they are first produce in the form of specific gluomagnetic field configuration , the _ turning points _ , which i study right now @xcite .",
    "before we outline results of the specific calculations , let me emphasize the basic quantum mechanics of the process ( see the right - hand side of fig.1 ) .",
    "instantons are classical solutions describing tunneling from one classical vacuum ( in which @xmath92 and the @xmath93 is pure gauge ) to another : naturally the energy is zero on it .",
    "however if during tunneling some energy is deposited into classical field , from two or more colliding gluons , after the system appears from under the barrier it may propagate in real time .",
    "schematic example of that is shown in the right hand side of fig.[processes ] for three cases , with deposited energy ranging from zero ( the original instanton ) to that of the barrier maximum .",
    "the top point is known as @xmath78 configuration @xcite , first found in the electroweak theory .",
    "intensive studies of the instanton - induced processes also were done in this context in early 1990 s , driven basically by possible observability of baryon number violating processes in electroweak theory@xcite .",
    "the so called  holy grail function \" showed that processes with multiple quanta production indeed lead to growing cross section , reaching its maximum at the sphaleron mass and then decreasing .",
    "however , since in electroweak theory the maximal cross section has been found to be still very far from observability , the interest to this direction have mostly disappeared around 1993 or so .",
    "the results obtained so far are in reasonable agreement with data , and explain few qualitative points : ( i ) the pomeron intercept is small ( @xmath94 because it is proportional the @xmath95 power of the instanton diluteness parameter @xmath96 .",
    "( ii ) this mechanism also explains _ small size _ of the pomeron , ( as seen e.g. from the pomeron slope @xmath97 ) : the reason is small instanton size .",
    "( iii ) byproduct : at classical level _ no odderon _ appears .",
    "this is related to non - trivial property of instantons / sphalerons : they are always in some su(2 ) subgroup of su(3 ) ; and in su(2 ) there is no real distinction between quark and anti - quark .    in my recent paper @xcite",
    "it was suggested that the instanton / sphaleron mechanism may be a way toward the solution of this `` early entropy '' puzzle . in a way ,",
    "high entropy may come directly from `` sublimation '' of strong vacuum gluon fields and of the vacuum quark condensate .    assuming it to be the dominant process behind the logarithmic growth of the pp cross section , i estimated the probability of the sphaleron production directly from data .",
    "although the cross section of prompt production is _ surprisingly small _ in mean parton - parton collision , two orders of magnitude below geometric cross section @xmath98 , the total number of parton - parton collisions in @xmath99 aa collision is so huge that the number of `` promptly - produced objects '' ( mini - jet pairs or sphalerons ) in aa collisions per unit rapidity is estimated @xcite @xmath100 .",
    "although this number is similar to estimated mini - jet production events , this scenario provides significantly larger amount of the entropy produced .",
    "indeed , the mini - jets are just plane waves : they are classically stable and weakly interacting .",
    "the sphalerons are kind of resonances existing already at the classical level .",
    "they explode into spherical expanding shells of strong field , which rapidly sweep the whole volume and may convert it into quark - gluon plasma each qcd `` turning point '' cluster decays into several gluons plus ( with some probablity ) up to the whole @xmath101 set of quarks @xcite . key signature of these decays may then be a deviation from the `` hot glue scenario '' : @xmath101 should be there much earlier than it is possible due to pqcd effects .",
    "let me try to summarize the status of our field , which is a 21-year old youngster , full of life and experimentation , open to whatever those will bring .",
    "this makes this field rather unique among other fields in high energy and nuclear physics .",
    "helmut and other `` old - timers '' have all reasons to be proud of it .",
    "in particular : + ( i ) we finally have excellent dedicated machine , rhic , and look forward for other observables and for the lhc era for a decade to come .",
    "+ ( ii ) the field is growing well .",
    "it has enough open questions to provide challenges/ attract many _",
    "1-st rate _ young theorists . + (",
    "iii ) our understanding of the qcd phase diagram has grown enormously .",
    "all kind of symmetries ",
    "_ color , flavor , translations and even parity _  can be broken under appropriate conditions .",
    "+ ( iv ) amazingly , the optimists were right : only factor 2 in multiplicity ( from sps to rhic ) made a lot of difference ! it is a bang , not a ( so often predicted ) fizzle . and",
    "yes , we do see the `` qgp push '' .",
    "we seem to finally approach the macroscopic limit : hydro works , jets are quenched , ellipticity is very large , even at large @xmath4 . _",
    "the eos is being determined .",
    "_ remarkably , it seem to confirm @xmath102 the values of @xmath103 what lattice had predicted all along .",
    "+ outlook : yes , there are many questions left open : but those are being addressed as we speak .",
    "one outstanding question discussed above is _ how so large entropy has been generated so quickly_. the other problem i did not mentioned is what exactly is the shape of the freezeout surface , in view of current hbt data .",
