    "many observations of globular clusters suggest the possible existence of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses @xmath4 in the centers of some cluster cores .",
    "the predicted masses of these imbhs agree well with a simple extrapolation of the @xmath5 ( mass  velocity dispersion ) relation for galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "observations and dynamical modeling of the globular clusters m15 in the milky way and g1 in m31 appear to be consistent with such a central massive bh ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath6-body simulations by @xcite suggest that the observations of m15 and g1 , and , in general , the properties of all _ core - collapsed _ clusters , could be explained equally well by the presence of many compact stars near the center without a massive bh ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", these @xmath6-body simulations also suggest that many , perhaps most , _ non - core - collapsed _ clusters ( representing about 80% of globular clusters in the milky way ) could contain a central imbh @xcite .",
    "although the origin of imbhs is not directly constrained by any observations , one possibility that has received considerable attention is the growth of a very massive object through successive collisions and mergers of ordinary massive stars in the cluster core @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite demonstrate that mass segregation and core collapse could proceed so quickly that there is rapid , runaway growth through stellar collisions before the most massive stars have evolved to supernovae ( in @xmath7myr ) .",
    "other numerical evidence comes from the @xmath6-body simulations of @xcite , which demonstrate such growth in some young clusters .",
    "an important alternative , which we study in this paper , is the growth of an imbh through successive mergers of stellar mass ( @xmath8 ) bhs @xcite . in this case , the massive stars formed initially in the cluster ( with masses @xmath9 ) must have avoided physical collisions and mergers and instead were able to complete their normal stellar evolution and produce bhs . unlike massive stars , bhs have negligible cross sections for direct collision , so bh mergers can only occur through gravitational wave ( gw ) emission in binaries , possibly enhanced by dynamical interactions in the cluster ( see @xcite for a review and  [ bhform ] ) .",
    "even if it does not lead to growth and imbh formation , the dynamical evolution of bhs in dense star clusters could also produce large numbers of tight bh  bh binaries that will merge through gw emission ( possibly outside the cluster following dynamical ejection ) . these merging bh ",
    "bh binaries are likely candidates for direct gw detection and could even dominate the detection rates for ground  based laser interferometers such as ligo @xcite .      in a globular cluster , it can be expected that a fraction @xmath10 to @xmath11 of the @xmath12 initial stars will become stellar - mass bhs via normal stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "assuming that all stars with initial mass greater than @xmath13 become bhs , the most recent kroupa initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite gives a slightly higher initial bh fraction of @xmath14 , where we use @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the minimum and maximum stellar masses .",
    "when we scale this to the total mass of the cluster , @xmath17 , we find @xmath18 .",
    "all of these bhs should have formed before @xmath19myr , with the most massive bhs forming at around @xmath20myr .",
    "the radial distribution of these bhs in the cluster when they form is not known , but it is reasonable to assume that they should be much more centrally concentrated than the remaining main - sequence stars ( mss ) .",
    "this is for three reasons : ( 1 ) we expect significant mass segregation of the initial , higher - mass progenitors @xcite ; ( 2 ) there may be preferential formation of massive stars near the cluster center ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 3 ) bh birth kicks are not expected to be large enough to displace the bhs into the cluster halo ( or eject them from the cluster ; see @xcite ) .",
    "even if the bhs were initially distributed throughout the cluster , mass segregation would still be able to concentrate them into a central sub - cluster on a relatively short timescale .",
    "indeed , a bh of mass @xmath21 near the half - mass radius will be brought into the cluster core on the timescale @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the relaxation time at the half - mass radius , and @xmath24 is the average stellar mass @xcite .",
    "considering a typical cluster with @xmath25gyr , we see that a sub - cluster of bhs should still assemble near the center after at most @xmath26myr .",
    "after a time very short compared to the overall dynamical evolution timescale of the globular cluster , the bhs should then form a self - gravitating subsystem within the core , which is dynamically decoupled from the rest of the cluster .",
    "this decoupling is sometimes referred to as spitzer s `` mass stratification instability '' @xcite . the physics of this instability is by now very well understood , both for simple two - component systems and for clusters with a broad mass function @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the bh subsystem proceeds on a much shorter timescale since its relaxation time is now @xmath27 times smaller than for the parent cluster .",
    "interactions involving hardening of bh binaries will eventually lead to the ejection of bhs from the cluster , until there are so few left that the bh subsystem recouples dynamically ( returns to `` thermal equilibrium '' ) with the other cluster stars , and the interaction rate between bhs and cluster stars becomes comparable to the bh  bh interaction rate .",
    "for simple two - component clusters , @xcite derived through analytic methods the condition necessary to reach energy equipartition : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the total masses of the two components , and @xmath30 the mass of each individual object .",
    "@xcite used an empirical approach to find the more accurate condition @xmath31 for a cluster with total mass @xmath32 , bh mass @xmath33 , and average star mass @xmath34 , the cluster can be in equipartition , according to equation  ( [ eqpart ] ) , when there are @xmath35 bhs in the cluster , i.e. , significantly fewer than the number expected to form from the imf",
    ". the minimum number of bhs required to decouple from the cluster would likely be even less if their mass spectrum was considered @xcite .",
    "for most of its subsequent dynamical evolution , we expect the bh sub - cluster to remain largely free of other kinds of stars , even mss with comparable masses .",
    "indeed , for bhs to have formed , the most massive stars in the cluster must have avoided runaway collisions .",
    "this requires an initial half - mass relaxation time @xmath36myr @xcite . on the other hand , by the time",
    "the ms turnoff has decreased to @xmath37 , driving core collapse to concentrate the remaining @xmath37 mss into the core ( where they could then interact with the bhs ) before they evolve would require @xmath38myr ( @xcite ; see especially their fig .",
    "therefore we see that the parameter space for clusters where both bhs and massive mss would segregate and decouple simultaneously is probably very small , or nonexistent .",
    "this will allow us to concentrate on `` pure '' bh systems in our numerical simulations (  2 ) .",
    "this picture is not altered significantly by the presence of binaries . during mass segregation , as the bhs start concentrating into the denser cluster core , they will likely interact with each other to form bh ",
    "bh binaries , if they were not already in binaries .",
    "bh  ms binaries will quickly undergo three - body or four - body exchange interactions that replace the lighter ms companion by a heavier bh @xcite .",
    "therefore , as the bh sub - cluster begins to dynamically decouple from the rest of the cluster , a considerable number of hard bh ",
    "bh binaries are expected to remain .",
    "this has been demonstrated with direct @xmath6-body simulations by @xcite , where they found that almost all bh - binaries ejected were bh  bh .",
    "motivated by the absence of bh x - ray binaries , @xcite and @xcite discussed the evolution and fate of @xmath37 bhs in globular clusters using simple analytic considerations .",
    "their conclusions can be summarized as follows . through dynamical interactions ,",
    "bh binaries tend to be hardened further ( whereas soft binaries tend to be disrupted ; @xcite ) . eventually , as the bh ",
    "bh binaries harden , the recoil produced by interactions becomes so great that the binaries can be ejected from the cluster .",
    "the timescale for merger by gw emission usually remains longer than the interaction time in the bh cluster so that hardened binaries are almost always ejected .",
    "eventually the number of bhs is depleted , and no more than a few bhs would remain in the cluster core .",
    "this would imply that bh growth through successive mergers in the cluster can not occur . even if @xmath39 bh remained at the center of every globular cluster today , it is unlikely that this would ever become detectable as an x - ray binary @xcite .    in order to better understand the complex interactions of bhs in clusters , @xcite performed direct @xmath6-body simulations of systems with @xmath40 and @xmath41 total stars , including a small fraction ( @xmath42 ) of equal  mass `` bhs '' 10 times more massive than the other stars .",
    "they found that @xmath43 of the bhs were ejected from the cluster after @xmath44 relaxation times of the cluster ( less than a few gyr for most clusters ) , including @xmath45 in bh ",
    "bh binaries .",
    "similar @xmath6-body simulations were most recently performed by @xcite , who studied the formation of a core of bhs in a two  component cluster , with @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite found that the bhs completely segregate to the core within @xmath47myr ( ignoring initial mass segregation of the higher mass progenitors ) .",
    "these results are consistent with our qualitative understanding of the interactions of bhs , and strongly supports the assumptions we will make in   [ manda ] .",
    "several studies proposed scenarios that could help bh  bh binaries merge inside clusters , opening the possibility of bh growth and imbh formation through successive mergers .",
    "@xcite suggested that one larger seed bh may help overcome the newtonian recoil , since the mass of the binary would be too large to have a recoil velocity greater than the escape velocity from the cluster , thus anchoring it in the core .",
    "it has also been proposed by @xcite and @xcite that binary  binary interactions may have a large influence on bh mergers in the cluster core .",
    "these authors suggest that binary  binary interactions can produce significant numbers of long - lived hierarchical triple systems in which the outer bh increases the inner binary s eccentricity via kozai - type secular perturbations @xcite , thereby increasing the merger rate .",
    "because these hierarchical triples may be driven to merge before their next interaction they should have a higher probability of staying in the cluster , and this can be a mechanism for retaining merging bhs .    @xcite ( hereafter gmh04 ) were the first to look at the possibility of successive mergers of bhs in a cluster core . in their simulations , gmh04 computed successive interactions between a bh ",
    "bh binary of varying mass ratio with single @xmath37 bhs sampled from an isotropic background . between interactions",
    "the binary was evolved according to general relativity .",
    "they concluded that gw emission allowed for more mergers than previously thought possible , but the number of bhs required to form an imbh would be much greater than believed to exist in a typical globular cluster .    in our simulations ,",
    "we treat not only binary  single interactions , but also four - body ( binary  binary ) interactions .",
    "most importantly , we compute dynamical interactions for a realistic mixture of single and binary bhs self - consistently within a `` pure bh '' cluster core . we implement a treatment for the secular evolution of triples , including the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
    "we also include , for the first time in any dynamical treatment , a more realistic imf for the bhs ( to be detailed in  [ init ] ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ manda ] we present our simulation methods and assumptions , as well as all our initial conditions .",
    "the main results of our simulations are shown in  [ results ] , where we look at evolution of all bh sub - clusters , and in  [ gravwave ] , where we look at merging binary bhs as a source of gws .",
    "finally we conclude our paper in  [ discussion ] with a summary and discussion of the implications of our results , and suggestions for further studies .",
    "ideally , to simulate the evolution of @xmath48 bhs in a massive cluster , one would like to do a full @xmath6-body simulation of the entire cluster , including the bhs and other stars . or",
    ", capitalizing on the fact that the bh subsystem dynamically decouples from the rest of the cluster early on , one could perform an @xmath6-body simulation of just the bhs , subject to the cluster potential due to the other stars and the effects of dynamical friction , which tend to bring bhs that have been kicked out of the core  but not out of the cluster  back into the core on a short timescale .",
    "although the second scenario is evidently computationally much cheaper than the first to treat via direct @xmath6-body techniques , we decided to adopt an even faster technique which , although approximate , includes all the vital physics of the problem .",
    "this allows us to sample a wider range of initial conditions , and make a more thorough map of the parameter space of the problem .",
    "we treat the evolution of a bh subsystem in a background cluster subject to binary interactions , using a monte carlo technique to sample interaction rates and treat mass segregation , in conjunction with the small @xmath6-body toolkit fewbody  to numerically integrate binary interactions @xcite .",
    "we assume that the bh sub - cluster has a constant density and velocity dispersion throughout its evolution .",
    "the justification for this assumption is that with any reasonable initial binary fraction ( @xmath49 a few percent ) , the sub - cluster will enjoy a long - lived binary - burning phase in which its core parameters are roughly constant with time @xcite .",
    "the code we use is a modified version of the one presented in @xcite , specially adapted to treat a bh system .",
    "each dynamical binary interaction is followed using fewbody , a numerical toolkit for simulating small-@xmath6 gravitational dynamics that provides automatic calculation termination and classification of outcomes ( for a detailed description see * ? ? ?",
    "fewbody  numerically integrates the orbits of small-@xmath6 systems , and automatically classifies and terminates calculations when an unambiguous outcome is reached .",
    "thus it is well - suited for carrying out large numbers of binary interactions , which can be quite complex and long - lived , and thus must be treated as computationally efficiently as possible .",
    "star clusters are characterized by a dense central core , surrounded by a much larger low - density halo .",
    "consistent with this structure of a star cluster , we assume that all strong interactions occur within the core , which has a velocity dispersion @xmath50 ( cf.eq .  [ [ veldispeq ] ] ) .",
    "if a product of an interaction has a velocity greater than the escape velocity from the core of the cluster , @xmath51 , then it is assumed ejected from the cluster and is removed from the simulation .",
    "if it is less than @xmath52 but greater than the escape velocity from the core into the halo @xmath53 , it is placed in the halo of the cluster , from where it can later reenter the core through dynamical friction with the background stars .",
    "dynamical friction is implemented in our code by sampling from a poisson distribution with an average timescale given in equation  ( [ eqseg ] ) with the average stellar mass , @xmath54 ( see  3.3 from @xcite ) .    between interactions , all bh",
    " bh binaries are evolved according to the standard post - newtonian equations @xcite , @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the masses of the two bhs , @xmath59 is the binary semimajor axis , and @xmath60 is the orbital eccentricity .    in some simulations",
    ", we account for linear momentum kicks imparted to the binary due to the asymmetry of the gw emission @xcite . because of the large theoretical uncertainty @xcite in the recoil velocity of `` major mergers '' ( i.e. , when the mass ratio @xmath61 ; here we assume @xmath62 ) , and the smaller but significant uncertainty from the spins of the bhs , we opted to neglect spin in determining recoil velocities in our simulations .",
    "we determine the overall recoil velocity of the merger remnant , @xmath63 , by using the form of the equation derived by @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the maximum magnitude of recoil , and @xmath68 is the radius of innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "@xcite found for circular orbits @xmath69",
    "km s@xmath70 , much greater than the escape velocity from any globular cluster , whereas @xcite found @xmath71 km s@xmath70 . in our simulations",
    "we set @xmath72 for ease of comparing @xmath73 with other works .",
    "we use @xmath73 near or slightly above the escape velocity of the cluster , up to @xmath74 km s@xmath70 .",
    "the form of equation  ( [ recoil ] ) is consistent with the analysis of @xcite , who found the recoil velocity for the merger of two non - spinning bhs to be @xmath75 km s@xmath70 at the second post - newtonian order .",
    "we do not account for gw recoil in the merger of the inner binaries that are part of hierarchical triples , because in the simulations where we include gw recoil , mergers in hierarchical triples are insignificant .",
    "@xcite shows that for the velocity dispersions ( @xmath76 km s@xmath70 ) and numbers of bhs ( @xmath77 ) expected in the star clusters we are investigating , the rate of two - body binary formation from gravitational bremsstrahlung is much less than that of regular ( newtonian ) three - body binary formation , whereby a binary is formed with the help of a third bh , which takes away the excess energy needed to form the bound pair .",
    "therefore , for our simulations , we only account for three - body and binary  binary ( four - body ) newtonian interactions .    in a dense sub - cluster of bhs",
    ", three - body binary formation can lead to the formation of a significant number of bh binaries , and eventually can help lead to the disruption of the entire sub - cluster .",
    "@xcite calculated the three - body binary formation rate for a binary of minimum hardness @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the maximum size of the region in which the three objects interact and @xmath50 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion of the core .",
    "the final rate per star they found for the formation of a binary with hardness @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath83 is the core density of the bhs , @xmath84 is the core density of objects of mass @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the core density of objects of mass @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the relative velocity of the first object with respect to the second , and @xmath89 is the relative velocity of the third object with respect to the center of mass of the first two objects .",
    "we follow the exact treatment of dynamical interactions of @xcite but include three - body binary formation with @xmath90 in a consistent manner ( see , in particular , their  3.4 ) .",
    "we note that a more accurate criterion for the minimum binding energy we use should be based on the orbital velocity of the lightest member of the formed binary since we are not looking at equal ",
    "mass clusters @xcite .",
    "however , since we typically do not have mass ratios above @xmath91 , we find our criterion to be sufficient .",
    "because the code is not yet capable of following the evolution of triples between interactions , we must break them up before the next interaction time - step . in order to determine how to destroy the triple , we check if the binary is likely to merge before its next interaction . as a first step ,",
    "we integrate numerically equations  ( [ pet1 ] )  and  ( [ pet2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we also scale the timescale of merger according to @xcite by calculating the maximum eccentricity from a first order kozai mechanism approximation without post - newtonian precession by solving equation  ( 8) of @xcite .",
    "we then use the smaller merger time of the two methods .",
    "it is necessary to consider both methods because the scaling from @xcite overestimates the merging time in the instances when the kozai mechanism is insignificant . in this case , the inner binary is merely perturbed and the eccentricity does not fluctuate , therefore the timescale of the merger should be the same as for an unperturbed binary . if the inner binary is likely to merge before the triple would interact with a field bh or bh  bh binary it is immediately merged , otherwise the triple is broken - up keeping the inner binary . here , we assume that the outer bh is ejected from the triple with a velocity equal to its relative velocity with the center of mass of the triple .",

    "the parameters used in all our simulations can be found in table [ tab1 ] .",

    ", we can calculate the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath109 , the escape velocity from the center of the potential to the half - mass radius , @xmath53 , the escape velocity of a bh in the core from the entire cluster , @xmath52 , and the escape velocity of a bh at the half - mass radius from the entire cluster , @xmath110 .",
    "we analyzed relatively massive and dense clusters , precisely the types of clusters where bh growth would be expected .",
    "specifically , we systematically varied @xmath17 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and @xmath83 between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "most of our simulations had 512 bhs ( @xmath115 = 512 ) , but in two simulations we looked at clusters with smaller and larger numbers of bhs .",
    "all of these parameters are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the escape velocities are used to determine whether the product of an interaction is to remain in the cluster as prescribed in  [ methods ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the bhs , @xmath116 , can be related to the one - dimensional velocity dispersion simply as @xmath117 .",
    "the properties of the decoupled sub - cluster in relation to the properties of the cluster core are not so apparent . in our simulations",
    "we need to know the initial velocity dispersion of the bhs , @xmath118 .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the mean kinetic energy of the dynamically decoupled massive objects is only a few times larger than for other objects in the core @xcite .",
    "when decoupling , the bhs will have an effective velocity dispersion which we write as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the velocity dispersion of the core , @xmath121 is the average bh mass , and @xmath122 is the ratio of the mean kinetic energy of the bhs to that of the rest of the core , with @xmath123 corresponding to complete energy equipartition .",
    "because the bhs are dynamically decoupled from the rest of the cluster , they will undergo their own independent evolution as a small cluster of stars , increasing their density and velocity dispersion in the process .",
    "therefore we look at sub - clusters with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "in this section , we discuss our results for the evolution of the bh sub - cluster and we analyze the conditions under which successive mergers of bhs lead to the growth and retention of candidate imbhs .    in most of our simulations the bh sub - clusters reach equipartition ( our standard for the complete disruption of the sub - cluster ) in a few gyr . in the most extreme cases the sub - cluster may dissipate in less than @xmath128myr , as in the very dense model v3e5e7k11 ; or not at all , as in all models with @xmath129 .",
    "we also find there is a significant probability a bh with mass @xmath2 can form . for clusters that reach equipartition ,",
    "massive bhs are most likely to form in clusters with high core densities and temperatures .",
    "this also leads to more growth for a given king profile .",
    "also , king models with lower @xmath130 are more likely to form candidate imbhs .",
    "the growth of massive bhs is highly dependent on the maximum gw recoil velocity , nearly stopping it completely even when it is only a few percent larger than the core escape speed .",
    "the fate of the bhs in the cluster is determined mainly by their characteristic interaction rate in the core .",
    "however , two main questions remain regarding how the space of initial cluster parameters is divided among the different possible outcomes : does the bh sub - cluster reach equipartition with the cluster stars within a hubble time ? do the bhs experience enough successive mergers to form an imbh ? because of the simplicity of our model and speed of our code , the trends associated with varying one parameter in the simulation are evident .",
    "figure  [ compnum ] shows the number of bhs located in the cluster core and halo as a function of time for a variety of different cluster types .",
    "we see that most bhs remain in the cluster core rather than in the halo of the cluster .",
    "a fraction @xmath131 of all the bh ",
    "bh mergers from cluster occur within the halo .",
    "the sudden drop in the binary fraction , as seen again in figure  [ compnum ] , can be attributed to strong binary  binary interactions . even though this causes a low binary fraction for the majority of the dynamical evolution of the sub - cluster , approximately @xmath132 of the bhs",
    "are ejected in binaries when the bh sub - cluster reaches equipartition in a hubble time .",
    "for sub - clusters with low densities and high velocity dispersions , the three - body binary formation rate can become so small that a newly formed binary is disrupted before the next binary formation . despite this",
    ", our simulations suggest that there always exists at least one binary in the core that may be able to keep the sub - cluster from undergoing core collapse .",
    "this binary , among others , is created through three - body binary formation , which is the underlying mechanism for the entire evolution of the sub - cluster .",
    "since bhs are only ejected from the cluster after three- or four - body interactions , bh sub - clusters that do not produce binaries at a high rate do not dissolve within a hubble time ( see , e.g. , models e5e5king7 , e5king9 , and v22e6e5k9 ) .",
    "if the sub - clusters parameters have not changed significantly over the evolution of the entire cluster , then a significant number of single bhs could exist in clusters similar to those considered in our simulations .",
    "our simulations uniquely allow us to follow the interactions of a realistic mix of single and binary  bhs and monitor the growth of bhs through successive mergers .",
    "we find that in a given king model , clusters with greater core densities and larger masses have a greater probability of forming an imbh .",
    "they usually grow to even larger masses . for a fixed mass cluster that fits a given king model profile larger core densities result in a smaller half - mass relaxation time , @xmath23 .",
    "if this timescale is small enough , the cluster may actually undergo runaway growth through stellar collisions .",
    "this suggests that one is more likely to find an imbh , whether formed through successive bh mergers or stellar collisions , in clusters with dense cores .",
    "however , clusters with lower degrees of central concentration ( smaller @xmath130 , and higher @xmath50 ) seem to have more bh growth .",
    "figure [ masseject ] shows the mass distributions of the largest bhs formed in a few different cluster types .",
    "we see that when clusters completely disrupt in less than a hubble time , larger core temperatures directly correlate with more growth of a single massive bh .",
    "this is evident in the directly comparing models v2e55k9 and v3e55k9 ( where @xmath133 and @xmath125 respectively ) .",
    "although the difference in the average number of mergers in the cluster is small ",
    "v2e55k9 had about 14 mergers whereas v3e55k9 had about 13the number and sizes of the large bhs formed are dramatically different .",
    "model v2e55k9 had about twice the number of bhs as v3e55k9 with mass @xmath134 remain in the core at equipartition , and an average mass of the largest bh remaining in the core about @xmath135 larger as well . in model v3e55k9 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of the bhs , @xmath118 , is lower than v2e55k9 .",
    "as is evident in equation  ( [ threebody ] ) , the interaction rate increases rapidly with lower velocity dispersions , and hence leads to a quicker dissipation of the bh sub - cluster .",
    "this is consistent with our understanding that three - body binary formation drives the evolution to the eventual equipartition of the system .    in clusters where there are successive bh mergers ,",
    "the first formation of bhs with mass @xmath2 occurs at @xmath19myr after the sub - cluster formed , roughly independent of the cluster model .",
    "the probability that the cluster has a bh with mass @xmath2 is then proportional to the logarithm of time ( until the cluster reaches equipartition ) .",
    "on such a short timescale , one may worry that the bhs could also be colliding with massive stars , counter to our assumption of a `` pure bh '' system .",
    "however , as we discussed in   [ intro ] ,",
    "for clusters in which runaway collisions of massive stars were avoided , the massive stars are not expected to enter the bh core before exploding as supernovae .",
    "one explanation for why bhs would stay in the cluster and not be ejected by hardening and eventual recoil is the kozai mechanism in stable hierarchical triples @xcite .",
    "if the relative inclination between the orbital planes in a given triple is large enough , the inner binary s eccentricity can be driven to a high value ( formally to 1 ) . the high eccentricity",
    "necessarily means a decrease in the merging time of the inner binary so that the inner binary will merge before the triple s next likely interaction .",
    "we find that , typically , this has no significant effect on the formation of large bhs .",
    "overall , mergers caused by the kozai mechanism account for less than @xmath136 of the total mergers , and a negligible amount in most models .",
    "for example , the model with the largest percentage of triple mergers , v3e5k11 , exhibits almost no growth at all , with none of the 14 runs having a bh with mass greater than even @xmath137 .",
    "another possibility that favors the retention of large bhs in clusters is the introduction of a massive seed bh @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum of bhs given in bsr04 generally includes a bh of @xmath138 in each cluster .",
    "the presence of a bh of this mass does not always mean that this bh will remain in the cluster .",
    "in fact , the largest initial bh is almost always ejected from the cluster .",
    "although @xcite suggest that the introduction of a seed bh with mass @xmath139 may be sufficient to cause significant growth , we find that this is still not massive enough , in agreement with gmh04 .",
    "in model v2e55k9100 we introduce an initial seed bh of mass @xmath140 ; in model v2e55k9200 a @xmath141 seed bh .",
    "we find that even bhs with these large masses can easily be ejected from the cluster .",
    "for example , in model v2e55k9100 , the seed bh was retained only @xmath142 of the time . even in model v2e55k9200 , with a seed bh of @xmath143 , the seed bh is again retained only @xmath144 of the time .",
    "these probabilities are still lower than those in gmh04 , where they found the bhs to be retained in a similar cluster @xmath145 and @xmath43 of the time , respectively . this discrepancy can likely be attributed to the mass distribution of bhs in our simulations .",
    "the average mass of the bhs in our simulation is @xmath146 higher than in gmh04 , and thus there is an increased probability that the large seed bhs will be ejected .",
    "one key question regarding coalescing binary bhs is the magnitude of linear recoil caused by the asymmetry of the gw emitted by the binary .",
    "our code allows us to prescribe a systemic recoil velocity for every bh  bh merger . through this",
    "we can follow the effects of gw recoil in a cluster environment .",
    "we are able to understand the possible effects of gravitational recoil by varying the maximum magnitude of the recoil velocity in the base model v2e55k9 @xcite .",
    "as expected , the number of successive mergers has a strong dependence on the maximum recoil velocity ; however , it seems that it has only a small effect on the overall dynamics of the rest of the bh sub - cluster .",
    "increasing the recoil has almost no noticeable effect on the total number of mergers in the cluster , but can have significant consequences on the rate of bh  bh inspirals ( see  [ gravwave ] ) .",
    "even a maximum recoil velocity slightly larger than the escape velocity of the core ( @xmath147 km s@xmath70 ) dramatically changes the number of large bhs formed in this model , as seen in figure  [ masseject ] . with this recoil velocity ,",
    "the probability of forming a @xmath148 is cut in half .",
    "when we look at higher recoil velocities , the possibility of growing a large bh gets only smaller .",
    "this is not such a surprising result when one considers our simple prescription for modeling gw recoil . in mergers with a mass ratio , @xmath149 , or when",
    "@xmath150 , the coalescing binary will generally be ejected when @xmath67 is close to the core escape speed ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eqn3 ] ] ) . for bhs which go through successive mergers ,",
    "it is likely that before reaching masses @xmath134 the bh will have already been ejected .",
    "however , since this only affects bhs after they merge , the number of mergers remains relatively unaffected .",
    "our simple model of gw recoil neglects some aspects of the process , which could alter results .",
    "in particular , we do not follow the evolution of the bhs spins .",
    "because of this , we must neglect the effects of spin on recoil , and therefore do not look at alternative paths to large bh retention .",
    "one possibility is that if the bhs with the appropriate spins merge , some clusters could still retain larger bhs , even if the recoil velocity of the bhs with no spin is much larger than the escape speed . on the other hand ,",
    "spin breaks the symmetry of the binary and can lead to large recoil velocities even for equal  mass binaries @xcite .",
    "inspiraling bhs with high eccentricity have very complex gravitational waveforms , and their additional free parameters make computational searches even more expensive",
    ". therefore we want to know the eccentricity of the merging bhs orbits as they enter possible detection bands of current and future gravitational wave detectors .",
    "many ground  based laser interferometers are currently in operation .",
    "these detectors , such as ligo , are sensitive to gws above @xmath151hz , below which seismic noise dominates the noise curve @xcite .",
    "also , in the planning stages is a space  based laser interferometer , lisa , which , with its longer baseline , is expected to be sensitive to gws with frequencies @xmath152hz @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions , such as those in a cluster core , coupled with the strong dependence of merging time with eccentricity , suggest that many binaries will have highly eccentric orbits after their last strong interaction .",
    "of course , gw emission reduces the eccentricity of the orbit by circularizing the binaries ( see eq .  [ [ pet2 ] ] ) , and therefore it is often assumed that most binaries can be fitted with gw templates for zero eccentricity .",
    "figure  [ histoecc ] shows that there will be almost no loss in possible ligo bh ",
    "bh binary sources with this assumption because , at such a high frequency , almost all binaries are circular .",
    "however , the eccentricity distribution will likely matter for space  based detectors since the inspiraling binaries have not been entirely circularized by the gw emission .",
    "this is consistent with the previous study by gmh04 .",
    "another important factor in detecting inspirals is the chirp mass of a binary , @xmath153 which solely determines the overall magnitude of the gws emitted by a coalescing circular binary .",
    "because our simulations allow for successive mergers of bhs , as shown in figure  [ chirpfig ] , some mergers have chirp masses well above those expected if dynamics were not included . because of our realistic initial distribution of bh masses , the chirp masses of most mergers is above the expected value for two @xmath37 bhs merging , @xmath154 .",
    "although , as we discussed in ",
    "[ formimbh ] , successive mergers of bh  bh binaries can lead to more inspirals of massive bhs , in most cases the chirp mass distribution at the end of the evolution of the cluster is not significantly different from early in the evolution .",
    "for one , about half of the mergers occur outside of the cluster , which were ejected through dynamic interactions early in the cluster s history before significant growth had occurred .",
    "also , only in a few cluster models is the probability of bh growth near unity , in which the massive bhs dominate the mergers in the cluster .    in figure",
    "[ timedist ] , we plot the average merger rate of model v2e55k9 as a function of time . the merger rate can clearly be broken into two regimes .",
    "the first occurs early in the cluster evolution , when the number of binaries has not been completely depleted .",
    "the second regime occurs after the cluster is nearly all single bhs with only a few binaries . during this later time the merger rate of the cluster",
    "falls off inversely proportional to the age of the cluster , independent of cluster model .",
    "overall our results agree with those of previous direct @xmath6-body simulations . in the simulations of @xcite , where @xmath40 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , @xmath157 , approximately @xmath135 of the bhs where ejected as single bhs and @xmath158 ejected as binary bhs .",
    "the lower values of binary ejection , which we found , can be explained by in - core mergers and the lower order interactions followed compared to @xmath6-body simulations ( the calculations of the authors were newtonian only , and so did not allow for mergers via gw emission ) . as shown in table  [ tabresults ] , in most runs @xmath159 of the bhs",
    "were ejected as singles and @xmath160 were ejected in binaries .",
    "the biggest divergence between our simulations and those conducted by @xcite is the energy distribution of ejected bh binaries .",
    "@xcite found that the ejected bh binaries had a binding energy distribution more or less uniform in the logarithm . in figure  [ logeng ]",
    "we show a typical binding energy distribution of the ejected bhs .",
    "our simulations produce a distribution much more log  normal .",
    "every model we analyze has a similar distribution of ejected bh binary binding energy , with values between @xmath161 , consistent with analytic considerations @xcite .",
    "this divergence can possibly be explained by the low number of bhs used in @xcite .    to see what effect the mass spectrum has on our simulations , and also to compare our data to the results of gmh04 , we use three different models .",
    "each simulation uses the same velocity dispersion and escape velocities as in gmh04 ( see model gmh in table  [ tab1 ] ) , but starts with a different mass function .",
    "gmha and gmhc both have @xmath37 and @xmath162 equal  mass bhs respectively .",
    "gmhb has bhs with a mass distribution consistent with our other simulations following bsr04 .",
    "this distribution has a corresponding average mass of about @xmath162 ( see  [ methods ] &  [ init ] ) . as can be seen in table  [ tabresults ] , using equal",
    " mass bhs in our simulations increases the number of binaries ejected by almost a factor of two .",
    "the models with equal  mass bhs , gmha and gmhc , have about @xmath163 of their bhs ejected as binaries , whereas gmhb has only about @xmath164 .",
    "figure  [ mill ] shows how the mass spectrum we use causes the cluster to reach equipartition at an earlier time and changes the timescales of when mergers occur , compared with a cluster of equal  mass bhs .",
    "bh  bh binaries formed through dynamical interactions may be some of the best sources of gws detectable by ground  based laser interferometers .",
    "previous studies of detection rates have led to a large range of possible values , with some of the greatest uncertainty coming from the dynamics of interacting bh binaries in massive clusters @xcite . in this section",
    "we determine possible maximum detection rates of bh  bh binary inspirals from some globular cluster models .",
    "to calculate accurately the net detection rate , one should convolve self  consistent densities and birth rates of observed star clusters throughout the universe with the mergers rates in our simulations . because there is great uncertainty in these distributions , we look at each of our cluster models , and determine how cluster densities and masses may affect the distribution of bh  bh inspirals , leaving a detailed analysis for further study .",
    "although current ground  based interferometers are not sensitive enough to detect mergers of inspiraling bh  bh mergers to any cosmologically significant distance , as these detectors become more sensitive they will be able to make detections to ever farther distances .",
    "it then becomes important that a consistent cosmological model is used to have a better understanding of detectable inspirals . in all of our calculations we use the best  fitting cosmological parameters found by @xcite from combining _",
    "wmap _ data with other measurements : @xmath165 km s@xmath70 mpc@xmath70 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 .    in our calculations , we assume that the globular cluster model was formed uniformly through the universe at a given cosmological time corresponding to redshift @xmath169 .",
    "we then record each detectable merger into one of 100 bins each with time width @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the current age of the universe , based on when the merger occurred .",
    "if @xmath172 is the number of detections in bin @xmath173 , we sum over the rate of each bin giving the final rate : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the current density of a given cluster model and @xmath176 is the redshift to bin @xmath173 . with @xmath177 , the proper distance to the edge of bin",
    "@xmath173 is @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the scale factor of the friedman - robertson - walker metric that satisfies the einstein equation , and @xmath180 .",
    "the factor @xmath181 in equation  ( [ erate ] ) comes from the cosmological time dilation of the merger rate .",
    "the final detection rate is directly proportional to the density of such clusters in the universe . for our calculations",
    "we assume that @xmath182mpc@xmath183 , independent of cluster model , for ease of comparing our results with other works . to put this in perspective",
    ", @xcite found the number density of all globular clusters to be @xmath184 based on rough fits to observations .",
    "our analysis does nt include the full distribution of cluster parameters , but instead looks at each cluster individually .",
    "the milky way , for example , contains hundreds of globular clusters , with only a fraction of clusters similar to those we look at in this study @xcite .    in order to be as precise as possible",
    ", we must determine which mergers could actually be detected by a given version of ligo . to do this",
    ", we must look at the accumulated signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) of a given merger at redshift @xmath185 .",
    "since , gravitational waveforms are invariant under redshift , we use the redshifted chirp mass of a given merger @xmath186 and its luminosity distance @xmath187 to calculate the snr of the merger , where @xmath188 is the proper distance of the merger as calculated in equation  ( [ propdist ] ) .",

    "we do not include the coefficient as calculated by @xcite in this equation since it is completely canceled out in equation ( [ snr ] ) and rescaled by @xmath189 .    the final piece of equation ( [ snr ] )",
    "is the cut  off frequency of the merger , @xmath197 , after which the waveform of the gws can not be accurately modeled .",
    "this frequency is generally regarded to be the frequency of gws at the binary s last circular orbit ( lco ) , after which the bhs plunge into each other in a time less than the orbital period . in their calculations",
    ", @xcite found that for two @xmath37 schwarzschild bhs the frequency of the orbit at the lco is @xmath198hz , using what they called `` hybrid '' equations that were valid through ( post)@xmath199newtonian order for arbitrary masses . because their calculations also showed that this is a lower limit of the orbital frequency of the binary for an arbitrary mass ratio , we choose to use this limit for calculating @xmath197 .",
    "for circular orbits , the gw frequency is twice the orbital frequency , therefore in our calculations we use @xmath200 as the cut  off frequency of detectable gws , where @xmath201 and @xmath185 is the redshift of the merger .",
    "the location of the lco and its corresponding orbital frequency are far from well established .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations and other analytic approximations have shown the orbital frequencies of equal  mass bhs to be only larger than the value we use here @xcite .",
    "we see , in figure  [ rate ] , the expected detection rates of bh binary mergers for cluster v2e55k9 . here we assume that all clusters of this model formed when @xmath202 , or @xmath203gyr ago , using the assumptions and equations of ",
    "[ wavecalc ] .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , for the luminosity distances advanced ligo is expected to reach , the detection rate scales well by the power ",
    "law @xmath204 .",
    "this can be explained by the time evolution of the merger rate of bhs .",
    "we find , for all simulations , that the merger rate scales as @xmath205 after the disruption of the primordial binaries .",
    "for the distances of mergers advanced ligo is expected to be able to detect , the clusters are relatively old and hence , the rate changes very little .",
    "the detection rates and theoretical uncertainty of all models can be found in the last two columns of table  [ tabresults ] .",
    "we find for model v2e55k9 , for a version of ligo capable of detecting ns - ns mergers at a luminosity distance , @xmath206 , the net detection rate is @xmath207 . for v2e55k9e8 , which has the same conditions as v2e55k9 , but a recoil velocity @xmath208 , the net detection rate is actually higher than v2e55k9 at @xmath209 .",
    "one cause for this may seem to be the lower cut  off frequency of high mass binary mergers , but this is wrong . when analyzing the detection rate assuming a universal chirp mass for all mergers , the rate was still higher .",
    "it can actually be attributed to the higher merger rate later in the evolution of the cluster .",
    "this delayed merger rate may be a result of a few mechanisms .",
    "the dependence of merger rate in models v2e55k9 - 100 and v2e55k9 - 200 suggests that having more massive objects in the cluster results in a lower rate overall at the end of the evolution .",
    "model v2e55k9 - 200 , which has a @xmath141 seed bh , has a merger about half that of model v2e55k9 .",
    "another , slightly less significant mechanisms can still possibly be the masses of the merging binaries .",
    "the timescale for merger is longer when the masses of the objects are less ( see eqs . [",
    "[ pet1 ] ] and [ [ pet2 ] ] ) .    within the level of theoretical uncertainty ,",
    "the final detection rate is roughly proportional to the initial number of bhs .",
    "this , of course , is not exact , and is nt expected to be .",
    "the timescale for cluster disruption is also proportional to the number of bhs , so it should be expected that there would be some variance in the merger rate at later times depending on the initial number of bhs .    in order to get an estimated value of the actual advanced ligo detection rate",
    ", we must consider not only the number density of the massive globular clusters we look at here , but also the density of the low mass clusters .",
    "our results suggest that the expected detection rate scales proportionally to the initial number of bhs in the cluster . considering the number of bhs that @xcite quoted as being in the globular clusters they analyzed",
    ", we would expect the actual rate to lie within the range of rates for the clusters reported in table  [ tabresults ] , rescaled to the number density of globular clusters in the universe ( @xmath210mpc@xmath183 ) .",
    "our work is based on the reasonable assumption that , in a sufficiently large and dense star cluster , bhs created via stellar evolution concentrate in an inner core and effectively decouple from the rest of the cluster following mass segregation and the development of the spitzer instability . taking advantage of this decoupling ,",
    "we have computed the dynamical evolution of the bhs in a highly simplified treatment of the stellar dynamics but covering a wide range of cluster models and repeating calculations for each model in order to obtain a complete statistical description of outcomes .",
    "our assumed initial distributions of bh masses and binary parameters are based on the most recent population synthesis calculations for young stellar systems . in our simulations",
    ", we use a simple monte carlo method to follow the evolution of the bh subsystem in a fixed background cluster described by a king model .",
    "the bhs are allowed to interact only in the core , described by a constant density and velocity dispersion .",
    "all interactions involving binaries are computed exactly by direct ( fewbody ) integrations but we implement three - body binary formation using a simple analytic rate formula ( eq .  [ [ threebody ] ] ) . binary formation through dissipative two - body encounters is negligible in the systems we consider here ( with velocity dispersions @xmath211 ) .",
    "we allow for newtonian recoil of bhs into the halo , reintroducing them in the core following mass segregation . between interactions , bh  bh binaries are evolved taking into account gravitational radiation and the possibility of a merger ( eqs .  [ [ pet1 ] ] & [ [ pet2 ] ] ) . in some simulations , we attempt to model kicks due to gravitational radiation recoil in merging binaries , parameterizing the large theoretical uncertainty in a simple analytic formula that depends on the binary mass ratio only ( eq .  [ [ recoil ] ] ) .",
    "we present the results of our simulations in   [ results ] and [ gravwave ] , and ,",
    "in particular , we derive the probability of massive bh growth and retention in clusters ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also show that the kozai mechanism in triples has almost no significant effect on the merger rate , bh growth , or retention , in contrast to previous suggestions in the literature .",
    "in addition , we derive a net rate of bh  bh binary mergers detectable by current and future ground  based gw interferometers . we find , under extremely optimistic assumptions , that this can be up to a few tens of events per year , if we assume that the globular clusters likely formed over a time span @xmath212 . when including recoil from the gravitational `` rocket '' effect @xcite this rate is nearly doubled due to the increased merger rate from a population of less massive bhs .",
    "the simulations presented here improve upon previous studies in that we not only account for binary evolution due to gw emission between successive interactions of a fixed group of bhs , but we also use a realistic bh imf based on the most recent population synthesis models ( bsr04 ) .",
    "most analytic studies and numerical simulations so far assumed that all bhs were @xmath37 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , or included just one large bh ( gmh04 ) .",
    "the mass spectrum from bsr04 gives a slightly higher average mass ( @xmath213 ) , and also includes at least one significantly large bh , which is almost always ejected early in our simulations . even some of the largest bhs formed from mergers , with mass @xmath214 , are ejected from the cluster when they are formed early enough in the simulation to interact often with other large bhs .",
    "the distribution of the binary parameters also has a significant effect on the interactions .",
    "the low primordial binary fraction results in very few formed triples , and even fewer mergers in triples , whether enhanced by the kozai mechanism or not .",
    "the results of our simulations indicate a greater likelihood of moderate growth in globular clusters than previous @xmath6-body simulations have suggested possible , but they show varied results compared with gmh04 .",
    "our wider bh mass function makes the ejection of bhs with masses as high as @xmath215 very likely . on the other hand",
    "it also encourages the formation of even larger bhs through successive mergers , and the chirp masses of merging binaries are larger than would be expected for a cluster with equal  mass @xmath216 bhs .    despite the demonstrated growth , the probability for an imbh of @xmath217 to form directly via successive bh ",
    "bh mergers remains extremely small .",
    "however , we should not neglect the possibility of significant further growth of the final remaining bh through stellar collisions after complete evaporation of the bh sub - cluster . results from @xcite suggest that even a moderately massive @xmath218 bh could grow into a @xmath219 imbh after only a few gyr , well within the current ages of globular clusters .    initial conditions play a crucial role in determining the probability of imbh growth .",
    "in general , massive , dense clusters with high core temperatures have the greatest likelihood of bh growth .",
    "eccentricity growth through the kozai mechanism , although it makes it possible for bhs to merge with very little ( newtonian ) recoil , does not occur often enough to affect imbh formation .",
    "note , however , that our basic assumptions break down at late times , when the growth of bhs is most significant .",
    "eventually the number of remaining bhs becomes small enough that the constant core conditions assumed in our simulations are no longer justified .",
    "in particular , the bh subsystem will start interacting with lower - mass stars at a significant rate and it will then likely return to energy equipartition .",
    "this is why we emphasize the values computed by our code at equipartition , as opposed to the values at the end of the evolution (   [ bhform ] ) . beyond the return to equipartition",
    ", the evolution of the remaining bhs will be strongly coupled to the overall evolution of the whole star cluster .",
    "our simulations are far from complete , yet the results show great promise for future work . for one , we can expect that the most massive clusters will have the greatest likelihood of bh growth . to enter the next regime of even more massive clusters , such as galactic nuclei , one must account for binary formation from gravitational bremsstrahlung @xcite . also , because of the simplifications we make , it is also possible to explore an even larger parameter space , especially of the more numerous and less massive clusters . by convolving these data with the cluster formation history of the universe , one could determine a bh  bh merger detection rate to an ever more accurate degree .",
