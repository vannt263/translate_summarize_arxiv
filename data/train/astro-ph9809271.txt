    "statistical measures of the clustering of distant galaxies , and the identification of rich galaxy clusters at high redshifts , are both of great importance in the study of galaxy evolution and the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "the clustering of galaxies on the sky , as described in terms of the angular correlation function , @xmath1 , has been studied extensively at @xmath230.9 @xmath24 wavelengths .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath1 decreases on going faintward approximately as expected if galaxies undergo moderate luminosity evolution while their intrinsic clustering remains approximately stable in proper co - ordinates ( e.g. roche et al .",
    "1996 ; roche and eales 1998 ; postman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it is now possible to survey sufficiently large areas at near infra - red wavelengths , e.g. the @xmath25 @xmath26-band , to measure the galaxy @xmath1 amplitude ( baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; carlberg et al .",
    "near - ir surveys , compared to those at visible light wavelengths , contain a much larger proportion of early - type galaxies and are less sensitive to the effects of increased star - formation in the past , so may be particularly useful in studying the evolution of clustering separately from that of the star - formation rate .",
    "previously ( roche , eales and hippelein 1998 , hereafter paper i ) , we measured the @xmath1 amplitude to @xmath27 on 17 small fields totalling 101.5 @xmath4 , imaged with either the redeye near - infra - red camera on the canada - france hawaii telescope or the magic camera on calar alto .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude appeared to be relatively high compared to that from blue - band galaxy surveys of comparable depth ( e.g. roche et al . 1996 ) , suggesting the intrinsic clustering of red e / s0 galaxies is significantly stronger ( @xmath28 @xmath14 mpc ) than that of spirals and that clustering is approximately stable ( @xmath29 ) with redshift , but more @xmath26-band data was needed to improve the statistics .",
    "some faint galaxy surveys have shown an excess in the number of close pairs of galaxies compared to the number expected from the inward extrapolation of @xmath1 at larger scales ( e.g. infante , de mello and menanteau 1996 ) .",
    "the excess pairs appear to be interacting or merging galaxies , and the number observed suggest some increase with redshift in the merger / interaction rate , an important finding as the merger rate evolution is of cosmological interest ( carlberg , pritchet and infante 1994 ) .",
    "however , there have been large differences between the close pair statistics of different datasets . for example , in paper i , we found some excess of 23 arcsec separation pairs on the 12 fields observed in good seeing with the redeye camera , but not on the data from the magic camera , which was of lower resolution due to both poorer seeing and a larger pixelsize .",
    "similarly , our @xmath30 wide field camera survey ( roche and eales 1998 ) found the @xmath1 amplitude at @xmath31 arcsec to be significantly higher that at larger @xmath32 , indicating an excess of close pairs , on one 1.01 @xmath33 field but not on a second 0.75 @xmath33 field , where again the seeing was poorer .",
    "these inconsistencies suggest that faint galaxy close pair counts are critically dependent on data quality , and require similar analyses of further deep surveys .",
    "the identification of rich clusters of galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath34 ) is also of great interest  their number , richness and other properties may provide important constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. eke , cole and frenk 1996 ) . at visible light wavelengths",
    ", the contrast of clusters against the field galaxies falls steeply with increasing cluster redshift , making detection difficult at @xmath35 , but this is in part due to the strong k - correction dimming of early - type galaxies . in the @xmath26-band ,",
    "the k - correction produces a brightening to @xmath36 , for all galaxies , so clusters should be detectable to higher redshifts .",
    "near - ir surveys have already found rich clusters at redshifts as high as @xmath37 ( stanford et al .",
    "1997 ) and possibly at @xmath38 ( waddington 1998 ) .    searches for high redshift clusters have often concentrated on areas containing high redshift qsos or radio galaxies , as some of these sources do lie in rich clusters and the agn provides an easily measured redshift .",
    "the clustering environment of radio galaxies is of interest in itself for understanding their evolution . at low redshifts",
    "the more luminous ( frii ) radio galaxies are generally found in field environments , whereas at @xmath39 , luminous radio galaxies are found in similar numbers in the field and in rich clusters , with the average environment being approximately that of an abell class 0 cluster ( yates , miller and peacock 1989 ; hill and lilly 1991 ) .",
    "yee and ellingson ( 1993 ) explained this as an environmental influence on radio galaxy evolution , whereby sources in clusters decrease much more rapidly in radio luminosity at @xmath40 than those in the field .",
    "wan and daly ( 1996 ) found no observable differences between the powerful radio galaxies in field and cluster environments , and concluded that the change in radiogalaxy environment with redshift is most likely due to an evolution of the clusters themselves  an increase in the typical intra - cluster medium pressure between @xmath39 and @xmath41 might surpress frii activity in most rich clusters at lower redshifts and allow only the less radioluminous fri outbursts to occur .",
    "however , to better understand this process , it is important to determine whether there is any further change in the mean radio galaxy environment at @xmath34 .    in paper",
    "i , 17 high redshift ( @xmath42 ) 6c radio galaxies were cross - correlated with the surrounding @xmath43 galaxies to estimate their mean clustering environment .",
    "no significant signal was detected in the cross - correlation function ",
    "the upper limits were consistent with a mean radio galaxy environment similar to that at @xmath39 ( i.e. abell 0 clusters ) but argued against a much richer environment ( i.e. abell 2 clusters ) .",
    "however , at similar redshifts , some of the 3cr radio galaxies do inhabit rich clusters e.g. 3cr184 at @xmath44 ( deltorn et al .",
    "1997 ) and 3c336 at @xmath45 ( bower and smail 1997 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the clustering environment of 5 radio galaxies at @xmath0 , observed in the @xmath2-band with the large format omega camera on calar alto ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "the more moderate radiogalaxy redshifts and larger field areas compared to the paper i survey should improve our chances of finding clusters .",
    "section 2 describes the observational data and the detection of galaxies and stars , section 3.1 the visual impression of the radio galaxy environments and section 3.2 the modelling of distant clusters .",
    "we search for clusters centred on the radio galaxies using two methods , described in sections 3.3 and 4 respectively . in section 5",
    "we investigate the galaxy @xmath1 , and in section 6 the number of close pairs of galaxies .",
    "section 7 discusses the implications of all the results .",
    "our dataset consists of images of 5 fields , each centred on a radio galaxy at @xmath0 ( table 1 ) .",
    "one source is from the 6c catalog of radio galaxies with 151 mhz fluxes of at least 2.2 jy , the other four from the 7c catalog ( willott et al .",
    "1998 , and in preparation ) with a fainter flux limit of 0.5 jy ( these have names beginning ` 5c ' , as they were first detected in a 5c survey ) .",
    "these 7c galaxies have radio luminosities @xmath46 w@xmath47 , much lower than 3c galaxies but above the frii / fri divide .",
    "the five galaxies were selected from the catalogs solely on the basis of being in the desired redshift range , so should be an unbiased sample of @xmath0 radio galaxies .",
    "the fields were observed in the @xmath48 @xmath2-band ( wainscoat and cowie 1992 ) on the nights of 13 and 14 december 1997 , using the omega wide - field near - infrared camera at the prime focus of the 3.5 m calar alto telescope ( sierra de los filabres , andalucia , spain ) .",
    "this has a @xmath49 pixel hgcdte ( 12.5 @xmath24 ) array with pixelsize 0.3961 arcsec .",
    "each field was exposed for 30 seconds 120 times , and the 120 exposured stacked together and flat - fielded during the observing run . for the purposes of flat - fielding , the 120 exposures were slightly offset in a grid pattern , reducing the areas of the final images ( in which all pixels have a full 60 minutes exposure ) to approximately @xmath50 pixels or @xmath51 arcmin .",
    ".positions ( equinox 2000.0 ) , spectroscopic redshifts and @xmath2 magnitudes ( as measured from this data ) of the five radio galaxies [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it might be thought that the cluster on the 5c6.75 field would upwardly bias our estimate of the field galaxy @xmath1 , but repeating the analysis with galaxies within 1.5 arcmin of the cluster centre excluded produces little change in the results ( in units of @xmath52 , the uncorrected @xmath1 amplitudes become @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 and 20.0 respectively ) .",
    "although the @xmath58 amplitude in the core of abell 1/2 clusters may be several times higher than for field galaxies ( see e.g. hill and lilly 1991 ) , the excess galaxies within 1.5 arcmin of 5c6.75 amount to only 13 per cent of all galaxies on the ccd frame , which in turn is only one - fifth of our dataset , so the effect of their clustering on @xmath1 is greatly diluted .",
    "figure 7 shows the corrected and uncorrected @xmath1 amplitudes as a function of @xmath2 limit , from this survey and others in the @xmath26 band , and models described in section 5.4 .",
    "note that the paper i and carlsberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) results are plotted without a correction for star - contamination ( baugh et al .",
    "1996 are at sufficiently bright magnitudes that star - galaxy separation should be reliable ) . at @xmath5920.0 ,",
    "our uncorrected amplitudes are consistent with paper i.      having directly measured the galaxy clustering on these fields we can estimate its effect on the detection of rich clusters around the radio galaxies .",
    "considering cells of area @xmath60 , with a mean background density of @xmath61 galaxies in each , clustering will increase the variance @xmath62 of the counts in these cells as @xmath63 which for @xmath64 and a circular area of radius 1.5 arcmin gives @xmath65 . the background density for the 5c6.75 field",
    "was estimated as @xmath66 and the uncorrected ( as the background density will include contaminating stars ) @xmath67 , giving a background @xmath68 .",
    "the significance of the excess of galaxies within 1.5 arcmin of 5c6.75 is then reduced from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the @xmath71 significance from the cluster detection routine , which is presumably more statistically powerful as it takes into account the full cluster profile .",
    "we conclude that the effects of the clustering of unassociated galaxies on our investigation of radio galaxy cluster environments are non - negligible but relatively small , a @xmath72 per cent increase in statistical errors , and that the detection of the 5c6.75 cluster remains close to @xmath73 .",
    "the modelling of @xmath1 amplitudes is disussed in detail elsewhere ( e.g. roche et al . 1996 ; roche and eales 1998 ) and will be described only briefly here .",
    "essentially , the 3d two - point correlation function for the galaxies is parameterized as @xmath74 where @xmath75 normalizes the strength of clustering at @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the slope and @xmath78 the clustering evolution relative to the @xmath79 stable clustering model .",
    "this is integrated over a galaxy redshift distribution , @xmath80 , using limber s formula ( e.g. phillipps et al .",
    "1978 ) . here",
    "@xmath80 is given by the ple model of section 2.3 .",

    "with stable clustering and @xmath87 evolution , this model predicted a @xmath1 scaling consistent with observations in the blue - band , but appeared to underpredict the @xmath1 amplitudes from @xmath26-band surveys at @xmath8821.5 ( paper i ) .",
    "the results from the deep @xmath26-band surveys , in which early - type galaxies will be much more prominent , were better fitted by a model with even stronger clustering for early - type galaxies .",
    "the @xmath1 scaling from a large @xmath89-band survey ( roche and eales 1998 ) appeared well - fitted by a ple model with @xmath81 , @xmath13 @xmath14 mpc for e / s0 galaxies and @xmath90 @xmath14 mpc for spirals and irregulars , again with the same luminosity weighting , and @xmath29 , whereas clustering evolution of @xmath91 underpredicted the @xmath1 amplitudes . on figure 7 , the same ple model with @xmath79 but the @xmath75 from roche et al .",

    "the same model with clustering evolution of @xmath92 greatly underpredicts the @xmath1 of deep @xmath26-band surveys , and at @xmath93 is rejected by @xmath94 even before the correction for star - contamination .    at our fainter limits of @xmath9520.0",
    ", there may be some evidence that the @xmath1 amplitude falls less steeply than the @xmath96 model , and the amplitude from the small area studied by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) @xmath97 suggests that the @xmath1 scaling actually levels out .",
    "this might indicate an increase in the clustering of red galaxies at the highest redshifts ( @xmath98 ) , perhaps related to the enhanced clustering reported for hubble deep field galaxies at @xmath99 ( magliocchetti and maddox 1998 ) , but more data is needed to confirm this . if we assume the levelling out of the @xmath1 scaling is genuine , it can be fitted by the @xmath79 ple model with an increase in clustering to @xmath100 mpc ( see section 7.2 ) for all @xmath17 galaxies , as shown on figure 6 .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath1 amplitudes from this survey are consistent with previous @xmath26-band observations , favouring both strong ( @xmath101 @xmath14 mpc ) clustering for e / s0 galaxies and clustering remaining stable ( @xmath15 ) to @xmath102 ; if anything the clustering is stronger than an @xmath79 model at the highest redshifts .",
    "we discuss this further in section 7.2 .",
    "the @xmath1 from this data exceeded the fitted power - law at small separations of @xmath103 ( figure 6 ) , indicating that there is an excess of close pairs of galaxies .",
    "as in paper i , we quantify this using a method described by woods , fahlman and richer ( 1995 ) .",
    "a probability @xmath104 of occurring by chance ( in a random distribution of galaxies ) is estimated for each galaxy - galaxy pair , as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the surface density of galaxies brighter in apparent magnitude than the fainter galaxy of the pair , @xmath32 is the pair separation and @xmath107 an angular separation cut - off below which individual objects can not be resolved .",
    "we take @xmath108 arcsec and find the area around each galaxy by counting randomly distributed points in annular bins rather than assuming @xmath109 , thus taking into account field edges and holes .",
    "for all 1629 objects classed as galaxies to the estimated completeness limit @xmath93 , the pairs with @xmath110 are counted in @xmath111 arcsec bins of separation .",
    "we then perform an identical analysis on 25 randomized datasets in which the same number of ` galaxies ' , with the same magnitudes , are redistributed randomly over the field areas .",
    "the pairs counts from the randomized dataset and averaged , and their scatter used to derive error bars for a single dataset .      figure 8 shows a histogram for the @xmath110 pair counts compared to the random expectation . over the @xmath112 arcsec range , there are 157 pairs with @xmath110 compared to @xmath113 expected for a random distribution of galaxies . the excess above random , assuming the error to scale as @xmath114 , consists of @xmath115 pairs .    one one field , every pair was examined by eye , and only 2 out of 38 appeared spurious ( caused by irregular outer regions of bright galaxies ) , while the other 36 appeared to be genuine galaxy pairs , in many cases with signs of interaction .",
    "there are 15 @xmath112 arcsec pairs within 1.5 arcmin of the cluster radio galaxy 5c6.75 .",
    "this can be compared to 3.16 expected for a random distribution , increasing to 7.8 or 10.8 if , respectively , the pairs / randoms and pairs / galaxies ratios for this area are the same as for the whole dataset .",
    "hence our discovered cluster may contribute a few of the excess pairs , but increases the estimate of the fraction of galaxies in pairs by only @xmath116 per cent .",
    "no @xmath117 arcsec pairs are counted , as with the @xmath118 arcsec resolution they would be merged into single detections . the observed number of @xmath119 arcsec pairs is approximately the random expectation , suggesting ( by comparison with the number of @xmath112 arcsec pairs ) that only @xmath120 per cent of the true number are resolved .",
    "the number of close pairs missed due to image merging is estimated by assuming that all @xmath121 arcsec pairs are resolved and that the small - scale @xmath1 is still a @xmath122 power - law , which gives the true number of pairs above the random expectation at @xmath123 arcsec as 0.3068 the number at @xmath112 arcsec .    to estimate the number of physically merging or interacting galaxies",
    ", we must subtract from the observed number of pairs , the number expected from normal galaxy clustering , which will be higher than the random expectation .",
    "clustering with a @xmath122 power - law of amplitude @xmath124 at 1 arcsec increases the ratio of @xmath125 arcsec pairs to the random expectation by @xmath126 our measured @xmath1 amplitude at the @xmath93 limit corresponds to @xmath127 without correction for star - contamination or @xmath128 with correction , and the random expectation for @xmath125 arcsec pairs is 79.28 .",
    "hence , if we first neglect the star - contamination , the excess of @xmath125 arcsec pairs above the expectation from the larger scale @xmath1 amounts to @xmath129 .",
    "as each pair consists of two galaxies , the fraction of the 1629 galaxies in merging / interacting pairs is then @xmath130 per cent .",
    "taking into account the star contamination , the excess of @xmath125 arcsec pairs is reduced to @xmath131 , but the number of real galaxies is also reduced , to 1382 , leading to a very similar estimate of the merging / interacting fraction as @xmath132 per cent .",
    "this estimate is discussed further in section 7.3 .",
    "at low redshifts , the most radioluminous ( frii ) radio galaxies tend not to be found in galaxy clusters , whereas the much lower luminosity fri sources often are .",
    "this scenario changes at relatively moderate redshifts  hill and lilly ( 1991 ) found that 43 radio galaxies at @xmath9 , with a very wide range of radio luminosities , were distributed in similar numbers over field , abell 0 and abell 1 cluster environments .",
    "the mean environment of the 43 , quantified in terms of @xmath133 , the normalization of @xmath58 at @xmath134 mpc , was estimated as @xmath135 , approximately an abell 0 cluster , with no strong dependence on radio luminosity  for the most luminous ( 3c ) subsample the mean environment was @xmath136 .",
    "it was concluded that the mean @xmath133 of luminous ( frii ) radio galaxies ( including those of with the radio luminosities of our 7c sample ) increased by a factor @xmath137 from @xmath41 to @xmath39 .",
    "we aim to determine whether there is a further increase at @xmath34 .",
    "previously , bower and smail ( 1997 ) detected by gravitational lensing a cluster of apprximately abell 2 richness around a radio - loud qso ( 3c336 ) at @xmath45 , but found no significant lensing signal for 7 other 3c radio galaxies at @xmath138 , indicating a mean environment no richer than an abell 1 cluster . in paper",
    "i , we were able only to set a similar upper limit ( @xmath139 at @xmath140 ) on the strength of clustering around radio galaxies at @xmath141 , but here , due to the more moderate ( @xmath142 ) radio galaxy redshifts and the larger field size , we are more successful .",
    "we detect at @xmath143 significance a cluster of estimated abell richness @xmath6 ( class 1 or 2 ) , approximately centred on the radio galaxy 5c6.75 , with a profile consistent with that of a typical present - day rich cluster ( @xmath144 @xmath14 mpc , @xmath145 in equation 1 ) at the radiogalaxy redshift . of the other four radio galaxies",
    ", two appeared to be in groups or structures of lower richness than abell clusters , and two in field environments .",
    "we estimated the mean environment of our sample of @xmath142 radio galaxies as abell richness @xmath8 . using large samples of clusters , lubin and postman ( 1997 )",
    "find @xmath1462.52.7 @xmath147 , where @xmath147 is the core ( @xmath148 @xmath14 mpc ) richness , and hill and lilly ( 1991 ) fit @xmath149 .",
    "combining these two relations , @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath150 , consistent with the hill and lilly ( 1991 ) estimate for radio galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "hence , although a larger sample will be required to confirm this , our results together with paper i and bower and smail ( 1997 ) , suggest there is little further evolution in the distribution of luminous radiogalaxy environments from @xmath151 to @xmath152 .",
    "wan and daly ( 1996 ) explain the increase in the mean richness of frii radio galaxy environments between @xmath76 and @xmath151 as the result of an increase with time in the typical intra - cluster medium pressure ; once the pressure in a cluster reaches a critical threshold frii activity is surpressed and only the much less radioluminous fri outbursts will occur , so friis tend not to be found in clusters at lower redshifts .",
    "we infer from this that , firstly , if fri radio galaxies are not surpressed by intra - cluster pressure , their present - day distribution  a wide range of field and cluster environments with the mean richness being about that of an abell class 0 cluster ( prestage and peacock 1988 ; hill and lilly 1991 ; zirbel 1997 )  should reflect the range of environments of massive black holes capable of radio outbursts . secondly ,",
    "if at some high redshift , all clusters have an intra - cluster pressure below the threshold for frii surpression , the distribution of frii environments should then be similar to that of the low redshift fris .",
    "hence , on the basis of the wan and daly ( 1996 ) model , the rising trend in the mean richness of friis environments with redshift should approach  but not exceed  that of an abell 0 cluster at high redshifts , and , as the abell 0 richness has already been reached at @xmath39 , there would be little further change at @xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with our observations .",
    "the removal of a strong cluster - environment influence on the activity of radio galaxies beyond @xmath1530.50.6 might also help to explain the tighter correlation of radio luminosity to host galaxy mass for @xmath35 radio galaxies , compared to those at lower redshifts ( eales et al .",

    "i , there were more than twice as many @xmath183 arcsec separation galaxy pairs as expected by chance for the section of the data observed with the redeye camera , but the excess of pairs above the higher expectation from the fitted @xmath1 was of marginal significance , and no close pair excess was seen on the other half of the data observed with the magic camera . in the much larger @xmath89-band survey of roche and eales ( 1998 ) ,",
    "one of the observed fields showed a significant excess in @xmath1 at @xmath184 relative to the amplitude at @xmath185 arcsec , again suggesting merger - rate evolution , but the second field studied did not show a significant difference in the small and large scale @xmath1 amplitudes .",
    "on the five fields studied here , the observed number of close ( 1.55.0 arcsec separation ) pairs of galaxies exceeds , at @xmath186 significance , the expectation from the fitted @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1 at @xmath187 arcsec shows an excess over the fitted power - law ( figure 6 ) , even if @xmath1 even for a steeper power - law of @xmath188 , corresponding to the steepest @xmath58 observed for any type of galaxy ( guzzo et al . 1997 ) .    after adding an estimate of the number of unresolved @xmath189 arcsec pairs",
    ", we estimate that @xmath18 per cent of @xmath19 galaxies belong to @xmath125 arcsec pairs in excess of the fitted @xmath1 , if a @xmath122 power - law is assumed .",
    "this is consistent with the estimated pair fractions on the redeye fields of paper i at @xmath43 and on field ` e ' of roche and eales ( 1998 ) at @xmath190 . the clear detection of a close pair excess in this relatively high resolution ( @xmath118 arcsec ) data suggests that the non - detection on the magic fields of paper i and field ` f ' of roche and eales ( 1998 ) was simply the result of the poorer resolution ( @xmath191 arcsec ) of these datasets .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in close pairs can be interpreted in terms of an evolving merger / interaction rate , parameterized here as @xmath192 . following roche and eales ( 1998 ) , we assume @xmath193 ( on the basis that the merger timescale is much shorter than the hubble time ) and normalize @xmath194 at @xmath76 using the carlberg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) estimate that 4.6 per cent of local galaxies are in pairs of projected separation @xmath195 @xmath14 kpc .",
    "all such pairs will have an angular separation @xmath125 arcsec at angular diameter distances @xmath196 @xmath14 mpc , i.e. at @xmath197 in our chosen cosmology . at lower redshifts , assuming @xmath20 ,",
    "the fraction of these close - pair galaxies with @xmath125 arcsec will be @xmath198 .",
    "we then model @xmath194 by summing @xmath199 where @xmath200 @xmath201 over the ple model @xmath80 for @xmath19 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this predicts @xmath202 per cent for no evolution ( @xmath203 ) , 8.6 per cent for @xmath204 and 18.2 per cent for @xmath205 , with the observed @xmath206 per cent corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "this merger rate evolution can be compared with the @xmath207 estimated by infante et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from @xmath208 galaxies , the @xmath209 of roche and eales ( 1998 ) for the @xmath21023.5 range of limits , and the @xmath211 of neuschaefer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from deep ( @xmath212 ) hst data . taken in combination",
    ", these estimates may hint at a reduction in @xmath213 with increasing depth .",
    "carlberg et al . (",
    "1994 ) predict that @xmath213 will be sensitive to @xmath60 but will also be affected by any reduction in the mean mass of galaxies at higher redshift ( inevitable if merging is occurring ) , which would cause the merger rate evolution to depart from a simple @xmath214 form in that deeper surveys would give lower estimates of @xmath213 .",
    "for example , an @xmath215 universe is predicted to give @xmath216 at low redshift , falling to @xmath217 at the redshift where the mean galaxy mass is reduced by 32 per cent .",
    "our results and the others discussed here would be consistent with this scenario , but inconsistent with the more rapid merger - rate evolution ( @xmath2184.5 ) expected for @xmath166 . to accurately determine the form of @xmath219 , large and deep surveys with multiple passbands ( ideally both the near - infra - red and optical ) to provide photometric redshift estimates will be required .",
    "studies of close pair statistics appear to be critically dependent on data resolution , so any attempt to determine @xmath219 should use either space - based observations or only the sharpest of ground - based images .      the data reduction and analysis were carried out at the university of wales cardiff , using facilities provided by the uk starlink project , funded by the pparc .",
