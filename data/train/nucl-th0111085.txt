    "usually the frame of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite is the departure to the study of the nuclear many - body problem describing nucleons interacting with scalar and vector mesons .",
    "this meson field theory has quite successfully described the properties of the nuclear matter and finite nuclei using the mean field approximations for the meson fields .",
    "the vacuum polarization corrections arising from the nucleon fields as well as the meson fields have also been considered to study the nuclear matter .",
    "this is one way of obtaining a softer equation of state yielding a lower compressibility than would be reached without quantum effects .",
    "while descriptions of the nuclear phenomena have been efficiently formulated using some hadronic degrees of freedom as in qhd , there have been interesting observations which reveals the medium modification of the internal structure of the nucleon . for this , degrees of freedom from the fundamental theory of strong interacting systems , qcd , are expected to be considered . due to the complex structure of this theory we are lead to formulate effective models which have the main properties and symmetries of qcd as chiral symmetry and its spontaneously symmetry breaking .",
    "one of the first models put forward along these lines was the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) @xcite model .",
    "it is an extension of qhd which includes the explicit quark structure of the baryons .",
    "this model describes nuclear matter with nucleons as non - overlapping mit bags containing quarks inside them which interact with the scalar and the vector mesons .",
    "recently , the model has been extended to finite temperatures @xcite , neutron stars @xcite as well as to study beyond the mean field level by the incorporation of the exchange terms @xcite .",
    "the density dependent bag constant has also been investigated within this frame @xcite    in the present work , the vacuum polarization corrections , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , are included in the quark meson coupling model taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field ( as done in @xcite ) self - consistently as well .",
    "a similar approach is being investigated in the frame of qhd @xcite .",
    "the equation of state for dense matter is derived .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section ii , we derive the eos for dense matter including the quantum effects arising from the nucleons and the @xmath0-mesons within qmc model . in section iii , we discuss in detail the numerical results obtained in the present work and discuss possible outlook .",
    "the details of the qmc model have been given in ref .",
    "since we now include the vacuum polarization effects , we give here a few important steps for completeness .    in this model , the nucleon in nuclear matter",
    "is assumed to be described by a static mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar ( @xmath0 ) and the vector ( @xmath1 ) mesons .",
    "the quark field @xmath2 inside the bag then satisfies the equation @xmath3\\psi_q(\\vec r , t)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the current quark mass and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the quark couplings with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the normalized ground state for a quark ( in an s - state ) in the bag , which has a radius @xmath7 , is given as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dimensionless quark momentum and the single particle quark energy , in units of @xmath10 , is @xmath11 with @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the effective quark mass , @xmath14 is the quark spinor and @xmath15 is the normalization factor",
    ".    the boundary condition at the bag surface is given by : @xmath16 this , for the ground state , reduces to @xmath17 which determines the eigen frequency , @xmath9 , of this lowest mode in the medium .",
    "the form of the quark wavefunction in equation ( [ wavefn ] ) is almost identical to that of the solution in free space .",
    "however the parameters in the expression have been substantially modified by the surrounding nuclear medium .",
    "thus the quarks in the nucleon embedded in the nuclear medium are more relativistic than those in a free nucleon .",
    "the energy of the nucleon bag is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bag constant and @xmath20 parametrizes the sum of the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion and the gluonic corrections .",
    "note that this center - of - mass treatment is different from that of jin and jennings @xcite .",
    "the bag radius @xmath7 is that which minimizes the nucleon bag energy through @xmath21    we now proceed to study the equation of state ( eos ) for nuclear matter including the vacuum polarisation effects from nucleon and sigma mesons at zero temperature .",
    "the details of the theory have already been discussed in ref .",
    "only a few important steps are given here .",
    "the energy density after subtracting out the pure vacuum contribution then becomes @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{div}\\ ] ] the above expression for the energy density is divergent .",
    "after renormalisation by adding the counter terms @xcite , we have the expression for the finite renormalised energy density , @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{rhf}\\ ] ] the baryon density is given by @xmath27 in the above , @xmath28 is the spin - isospin degeneracy factor which is equal to @xmath29 for nuclear matter and to @xmath30 for neutron matter .",
    "next , we consider the quantum corrections due to the scalar mesons . including a quartic scalar self - interaction , the hamiltonian density for the scalar mesons becomes @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the bare mass and coupling constant respectively .",
    "we calculate the expectation value of the hamiltonian density and perform the renormalisation according to prescription of ref .",
    "the resulting gap equation for @xmath34 , which minimizes the energy , in terms of the renormalised parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 using the above equations we obtain the energy density for the @xmath0 in terms of @xmath39 which is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a mass scale .",
    "the above expression is given in terms of @xmath0 mass @xmath42 and @xmath36 except for the last term which is still in terms of the bare coupling constant @xmath33 and did not get renormalised because of the structure of the gap equation @xcite .",
    "however , from the renormalisation procedure it is easy to see in this last work that when @xmath36 is kept fixed , the bare coupling @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the last term in eq .",
    "( [ vph ] ) will be neglected in the numerical calculations .    after subtracting the vacuum contribution",
    "we obtain : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the expressions given by eqs .",
    "( [ mm2 ] ) and ( [ if ] ) with @xmath47 .",
    "the energy density and pressure with baryon and the sigma condensate @xmath39 are respectively done by @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 given by eq .",
    "( [ rhf ] ) and @xmath52 by eq .",
    "( [ vph0 ] ) .    the energy density from the @xmath0 field as given by eq .",
    "( [ vph0 ] ) is still in terms of the renormalisation scale @xmath41 which is arbitrary .",
    "we choose this to be equal to the renormalised sigma mass @xmath42 in doing the numerical calculations .",
    "this is because changing @xmath41 would mean changing the quartic coupling @xmath36 , and @xmath36 here enters as a parameter to be chosen to give the incompressibility for nuclear matter in the correct range .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath53 are fitted so as to describe the ground - state properties of nuclear matter correctly . for a given baryon density @xmath54 , the energy density , the density dependent radius of the nucleon and the nucleon effective mass",
    "are calculated at zero temperature .",
    "we now proceed with the numerical calculations for the nuclear matter .",
    "we start fixing the bag properties in the vacuum .",
    "they are given in table 1 .",
    "we next calculate the ground state properties of the nuclear matter and fit the scalar and vector coupling constants @xmath5 and @xmath55 to get the correct saturation properties for a given renormalised @xmath0 mass and coupling , @xmath42 and @xmath36 .",
    "the omega and sigma couplings for given @xmath36 are tabulated in table ii .",
    "results from relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) are also shown .",
    "little change is noted in the values of the parameters for the range of @xmath36 which is considered here .    using these values",
    ", we plot the binding energy @xmath56 for nuclear matter as a function of density in figure 1 . in the same figure we also plot the results for the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) . clearly , including baryon and @xmath0-meson quantum corrections",
    "leads to a softer equation of state which is further softer for a higher value of @xmath36 .",
    "the equation of state , pressure , @xmath57 versus as a function of energy density @xmath58 is displayed in fig . 2 for the different cases .",
    "for comparison , the causal limit @xmath59 is also shown in the figure .",
    "all the cases studied here respect the causal condition @xmath60 , so that the speed of sound remains lower than the speed of light .    in figure 3",
    "we plot the effective nucleon mass as a function of density . at the saturation density",
    "we get @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "these values may be compared with the results of @xmath65 for normal qmc model and of @xmath66 with the relativistic hartree approximation in qmc model .",
    "this influence is much higher at high nuclear densities .",
    "we can conclude that quantum effects , at the level we consider , increase the effective mass @xmath67 .",
    "we plot the _ in medium _ effective radius of the nucleon ( @xmath68 ) as a function of density in figure 4 .",
    "@xmath68 is also increased with relation to the mean field approximation mainly for higher densities .",
    "it is possible to understand this result as an effect which prevents qmc from deconfinement at high densities .    in figure 5",
    ", we plot the _ in - medium _ @xmath0-meson mass , @xmath69 , as a function of density .",
    "@xmath69 increases with density as @xmath36 is positive .",
    "the higher is the coupling , higher is the increase of the sigma mass with density",
    ". this would be rather an indication of a further chiral symmetry breaking instead of its restoration @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", we have used a non - perturbative approach to include the quantum effects in nuclear matter in the framework of qmc .",
    "the calculations of the scalar meson quantum corrections was done here in a self - consistent manner including multi - loop effects .",
    "this leads to a softening of the equation of state .",
    "we have also calculated the effective mass of the @xmath0-meson as modified by the quantum corrections .",
    "the effective sigma mass is seen to increase with density .",
    "the results may be suggesting that , at high densities , quantum fluctuations prevents the model from the chiral symmetry restoration as well as from deconfinement .",
    "these results will be extensively studied in another work where the coupling constant @xmath36 and its influence on the chiral symmetry behavior -whose order parameter can be considered to be @xmath39- at high densities and temperatures will be shown in the frame of the model worked out here .",
