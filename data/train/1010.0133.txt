    "we start by defining the terms in the title . by a _ surface _ we mean a compact connected 2-manifold without boundary . a _ quadrangulation _ of a surface is a loopless graph on a surface with all faces being quadrilaterals .",
    "we allow parallel edges and quadrilateral faces with some of its vertices or even edges coinciding . given an arbitrary orientation of all faces we can count the edges that break consistency of the orientation of the surface .",
    "( we say that consistency is not broken at some edge if , considering the orientation of a face as a closed walk along its boundary , we traverse the edge in opposite directions when considering the faces at its two sides . )",
    "note that reversing the orientation of a face changes the status of its four edges ( except for the edges appearing twice on the boundary ) and thus the parity of the number of edges breaking consistency does not change .",
    "we call a quadrangulation _ even _ or _ odd _ depending on this parity . by the previous remark ,",
    "the parity of the quadrangulation is determined by the quadrangulation itself and is independent of the actual orientation of the faces .",
    "note that every quadrangulation of an orientable surface is even as all faces can be oriented consistently .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the _ chromatic number _ of the graph @xmath2 .",
    "the following result was proved independently by archdeacon et al.@xcite and mohar and seymour @xcite .    [ am ] for an odd quadrangulation @xmath2 of a surface we have @xmath3 .",
    "the theorem only applies to non - orientable surfaces as orientable ones have no odd quadrangulations .",
    "youngs @xcite has established this earlier for the case of the projective plane .",
    "this result is simpler to state , since being even and being bipartite is equivalent for quadrangulations of the projective plane and since every quadrangulation of the projective plane is 4-colorable .",
    "the chromatic number of a quadrangulation of the projective plane is either two or four .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the above results for the local chromatic number .",
    "the local chromatic number of a graph is defined in @xcite as the minimum number of colors that must appear within distance @xmath4 of a vertex . for the formal definition ,",
    "let @xmath5 denote the _ neighborhood _ of a vertex @xmath6 in a graph @xmath2 , that is , @xmath7 is the set of vertices adjacent to @xmath6 . for an integer @xmath8 , we call a proper vertex - coloring @xmath9 of a graph @xmath2 a _ local @xmath10-coloring _ if @xmath11 for every vertex @xmath6 of @xmath2 . the _ local chromatic number _",
    "@xmath12 of @xmath2 is the smallest @xmath10 such that @xmath2 has a local @xmath10-coloring .",
    "the @xmath13 term comes traditionally from considering `` closed neighborhoods '' @xmath14 and results in a simpler form of the relations with other coloring parameters , like the trivial bound @xmath15 .",
    "more on the local chromatic number , including examples of graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number and local chromatic number @xmath16 , can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "first we state the generalization of youngs s theorem . this result",
    "was hinted in remark  3 of @xcite , here we give a full proof for the sake of completeness in the next section .",
    "[ pplane ] the local chromatic number of a quadrangulation of the projective plane is two or four .",
    "note that the non - orientable surfaces are determined by a positive invariant , their _",
    "genus_. the projective plane has genus one .",
    "next we generalize theorem  [ pplane ] for higher genus surfaces .",
    "this is the main result of the present paper .",
    "surprisingly , and unlike in the case of the chromatic number , the situation depends on the genus of the surface .",
    "[ main ]    ( i ) : :    if @xmath2 is an odd quadrangulation of a ( non - orientable )    surface of genus at most four , then @xmath17 .",
    "( ii ) : :    every non - orientable surface of genus at least five admits an odd    quadrangulation that has a local @xmath16-coloring using six    colors .",
    "we remark that at least five colors are needed to locally @xmath16-color odd quadrangulations or in fact any graph with chromatic number higher than @xmath16 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that any local @xmath16-coloring with four colors can easily be transformed into a @xmath16-coloring by changing the color of each vertex colored 4 to the color 1 , 2 , or 3 , which is not used in its neighborhood .",
    "if we insist on five colors , the threshold lies higher :    [ 5colors ]    ( i ) : :    if @xmath2 is an odd quadrangulation of a ( non - orientable )    surface of genus at most six , then @xmath2 has no local    @xmath16-coloring with at most five colors . (",
    "ii ) : :    every non - orientable surface of genus at least seven admits an odd    quadrangulation that has a local @xmath16-coloring using five    colors .    for ( some special cases of ) theorem  [ main](i ) we give several proofs because they use very different approaches . in section  [ sec : box ]",
    "we present the argument hinted in @xcite for theorem  [ pplane ] , i.e. , for the projective plane .",
    "it is based on the concept of the hom space of a graph , which is just a slightly different version of the graph complexes known as box complexes , see @xcite , or those more generally called hom complexes , see ( the cited second edition of ) @xcite . in section  [ sec : alg ] we give an algebraic proof for the non - existence of odd locally @xmath16-chromatic quadrangulations that works for both the projective plane and the klein bottle . in section  [ sec : comb ] we give a combinatorial argument that works for all surfaces of genus at most four , and henceforth proves theorem  [ main](i ) .",
    "the results provided in sections  [ sec : box ] and [ sec : alg ] follow also from the result of section  [ sec : comb ] . but both of the former sections indicate connections between different concepts that are not shown by the combinatorial argument in section  [ sec : comb ] . in section  [ sec : box ]",
    "we use a general connection between any surface and the hom space of its quadrangulation . in section",
    "[ sec : alg ] we show how an algebraic question about so - called semi - free groups is related to our graph theoretic problems . as a consequence of this connection and the existence of the quadrangulations claimed in theorem  [ main ] we can partially answer the algebraic question .",
    "the locally @xmath16-chromatic quadrangulations claimed in theorems  [ main](ii ) and [ 5colors](ii ) are constructed in section  [ sec : const ] .",
    "these constructions are motivated by the argument in the preceding section . in section  [ sec:5colors ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ 5colors](i ) .    by inserting a vertex in each face ( and joining it to the vertices on the boundary of that face ) of an odd quadrangulation we obtain a triangulation that exhibits similar behavior for the chromatic number : any subgraph contained in a contractible part of the surface is 3-colorable , but",
    "the chromatic number of the whole graph is at least five .",
    "it is shown in section [ sect : triang ] that the same holds for the local chromatic number .",
    "when coloring graphs on surfaces , another family of triangulations exhibits unusual behavior @xcite ; these are triangulations in which all vertices except two have even degree , and the two vertices of odd degree are adjacent .",
    "fisk @xcite proved that such triangulations can not be 4-colored , and we show that the same holds for the local chromatic number . finally , section  [ sec : last ] contains related remarks and observations .",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ pplane ] for which only a very rough argument was presented in @xcite .",
    "we start with the definition of medial graphs that will be used in the sequel .",

    "we connect @xmath29 and @xmath30 the same way .",
    "notice that @xmath19 is a 4-regular graph embedded in @xmath18 that has two types of faces .",
    "the _ star faces _ are the ones containing a vertex @xmath22 of @xmath2 and bounded by the cycle we introduced on the vertices of @xmath19 corresponding to the edges of @xmath2 incident to @xmath22 ( the star of @xmath22 ) .",
    "the _ cycle faces _ are the remaining faces of @xmath19 : each is contained in a single face of @xmath2 and its vertices correspond to the edges on the corresponding facial walk .",

    "we note that @xmath31 is a cell complex , whose cells correspond to complete bipartite subgraphs of @xmath2",
    ". more precisely , the cells are of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are non - empty , disjoint sets of vertices , such that every vertex of @xmath33 is connected in @xmath2 to every vertex of @xmath34 .",

    "( see @xcite for more details about covering spaces of graphs and surfaces . )",
    "let us observe that the double cover restricted to the graph @xmath2 of the quadrangulation is isomorphic to the categorical product @xmath50 ( sometimes called the kronecker product or the direct product ) , and it is connected if and only if @xmath2 is not bipartite .",
    "let us consider the involution on @xmath49 interchanging the pairs of points with the same image in @xmath18 .",

    "it is easy to see though that only the edges of a @xmath56-cycle on the boundary of these cells appear in other cells , therefore the higher dimensional cell can be collapsed to a @xmath56-gon without changing the homotopy type . after this collapse of every higher dimensional cell we obtain a complex homeomorphic to @xmath49 . @xmath57",

    "in fact , it was the investigation of the local chromatic number of the latter graphs that led us to the proof presented in the next section and to consider the local chromatic number of surface quadrangulations in general .",

    "as any homotopy type can be represented by a closed walk on @xmath19 , we have a map @xmath108 from the fundamental group @xmath109 of @xmath18 that gives as its value to each element of the fundamental group the label of the walks in the corresponding homotopy class . clearly , this is a homomorphism .",

    "this makes the euler characteristic of @xmath290 equal to @xmath292 .",
    "therefore @xmath290 is the non - orientable surface of genus @xmath226 .    to obtain quadrangulations of @xmath281 and @xmath290 from the above examples , we add a main diagonal to every hexagonal face of @xmath277 and @xmath284 .",
    "the choice , which of the three main diagonals to add is arbitrary for each such face .",
    "it is simple to check that the resulting graphs @xmath293 and @xmath294 are odd quadrangulations of @xmath281 and @xmath290 , respectively .",
    "notice that the new diagonal edges of @xmath293 are still edges of the original graph @xmath273 ( @xmath295 or @xmath279 ) : they are triangle edges that were removed earlier .",
    "this ensures that the natural coloring locally @xmath16-colors @xmath293 with @xmath226 colors and locally @xmath16-colors @xmath294 with @xmath279 colors .",
    "we have just given constructions for the first cases of theorems  [ main](ii ) and [ 5colors](ii ) .",
    "to finish the proof of these results we need to give examples similar to @xmath293 and @xmath294 but quadrangulating higher genus surfaces . for this note",
    "that both quadrangulations @xmath293 and @xmath294 have pairs of faces sharing a common edge and receiving only two colors .",
    "removing the common edge we get ( back ) a hexagonal face .",
    "we add a crosscap in the middle of this hexagonal face and quadrangulate the resulting surface by adding all three diagonals through the crosscap .",
    "the surface we obtain is of genus one higher than our original surface , the resulting quadrangulation is still odd , and the same coloring still locally @xmath16-colors the new graph .",
    "note that the resulting graph will again have neighboring faces receiving only two colors , so this process can be repeated any number of times finishing the proof of the existence claims .",
    "we remark that here we increase the genus of the surface with adding new edges but no new vertices to the quadrangulating graphs .",
    "this soon results in quadrangulating graphs with parallel edges . if one prefers quadrangulating graphs without parallel edges one can subdivide each edge into three edges and each face into a grid of nine faces .",
    "this has no effect on the parity , but it gets rid of any parallel edges .",
    "any local @xmath16-coloring extends to the subdivided graph using the same set of colors .    we also note that applying the above process exactly once to every hexagonal face of @xmath277 or @xmath284 we can see that the graph @xmath278 and an induced subgraph of @xmath283 are themselves odd quadrangulations of some surfaces : these are the non - orientable surfaces of genus @xmath296 and @xmath297 , respectively .",
    "in this section we turn the construction proving theorem  [ 5colors](ii ) around and use it to prove the impossibility result theorem  [ 5colors](i ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a quadrangulation of a surface and assume each edge of @xmath2 is oriented .",
    "we call a face of @xmath2 _ odd _ if the edges around it are oriented with three in one cyclic direction and one in reverse .",
    "the following simple observation shows that odd quadrangulations have an odd number of odd faces .",
    "[ edgeor ] let @xmath2 be a quadrangulation of a surface in which all edges are oriented .",
    "then @xmath2 is an odd quadrangulation if and only if the number of odd faces is odd .",
    ". * orient the faces of @xmath2 in an arbitrary manner and consider the facial walks in this direction .",
    "the parity of all face - edge pairs with the facial walk traversing the edge in reverse direction is the parity of all faces contributing an odd number ",
    "these are the odd faces  and also it is the parity of all edges contributing an odd number ",
    "these are the orientation breaking edges .",
    "* proof . *",
    "( of theorem  [ 5colors](i ) ) .",
    "we consider the graph @xmath277 described in section  [ sec : const ] as the graph embedded in the genus 7 non - orientable surface @xmath281 .",
    "add all main diagonals in all hexagonal faces to obtain a drawing of @xmath278 in @xmath281 where each of these newly added triangular edges cross two other triangular edges .",
    "let @xmath2 be an odd quadrangulation of another surface @xmath18 and @xmath9 a local @xmath16-coloring of @xmath2 with the five colors @xmath298 . as we have mentioned in the previous section ( and as proved in @xcite ) @xmath9 gives rise to a graph - homomorphism @xmath299 such that the natural coloring assigns the color @xmath300 to @xmath301 for every vertex @xmath22 of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath302 be a continuous extension of @xmath81 .",
    "first extend @xmath81 from vertices to the points along the edges , then realize that the facial walk of any face of @xmath2 is mapped trivially to one or two edges of @xmath278 or within a face of @xmath277 and thus can easily be extended within the same face .",
    "we want to use a simple result that relates the genera of two surfaces and degree of a mapping between them . as the degree is usually defined for oriented surfaces we consider the orientable double cover @xmath303 of @xmath281 and @xmath304 of @xmath18 with an arbitrary orientation .",
    "note that the euler characteristic of the double cover is twice the euler characteristic of the base , so the genera of @xmath18 and @xmath304 agree and so do the genera of @xmath281 and @xmath303 .",
    "the map @xmath302 lifts to @xmath305 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the degree of this map .",
    "consider a quadrilateral face @xmath201 of @xmath277 and let @xmath306 be the number of faces of @xmath2 that @xmath81 maps to @xmath201 .",
    "notice that the graphs @xmath2 and @xmath277 are also lifted to the orientable surfaces and the number of faces mapped to either one of the faces above @xmath201 is also @xmath306 . to obtain the degree @xmath56 of the map @xmath307 one has to count these inverse images with appropriate signs depending on whether @xmath307 keeps the orientation of the face .",
    "thus the parity of @xmath56 and @xmath306 must agree .",
    "in particular , the parity of @xmath306 is independent of the choice of the quadrilateral face @xmath201 .",
    "( note that using hexagonal faces of @xmath277 it would be harder to find the parity of the degree as some faces of @xmath2 map to parts of those hexagonal faces . )",
    "we use kneser s formula @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it states that @xmath308 for the genera @xmath309 and @xmath310 of @xmath304 and @xmath303 if a degree @xmath56 map from @xmath304 to @xmath303 exists .",
    "we use the consequence that @xmath311 whenever @xmath18 has genus less than @xmath194 .",
    "we claim that @xmath2 is an odd quadrangulation if and only if the degree of @xmath307 is odd .",
    "as @xmath312 is even , this claim finishes the proof of theorem  [ 5colors](i ) .",
    "it is easier to show the claim using lemma  [ edgeor ] considered as an alternative definition of odd quadrangulations .    to obtain an oriented version of @xmath2",
    "let us orient an edge @xmath36 from @xmath22 to @xmath144 if @xmath313 . the odd faces will be exactly those with some colors @xmath314 around the face in this order .",
    "so @xmath2 is an odd quadrangulation if and only if @xmath315 is odd , where the summation is for the quadrilateral faces @xmath201 of @xmath277 whose verices receive some colors @xmath314 in this order in the natural coloring .",
    "there are five such faces in @xmath277 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the claim and with it the proof of theorem  [ 5colors](i ) .",
    "note that a proof similar to the above is not possible for theorem  [ main](i ) for two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath284 is too small a part of @xmath283 , there are large parts of @xmath283 that are not represented by @xmath284 .",
    "second , even if @xmath284 was all ( or a large part ) of @xmath283 this line of thought would only prove the impossibility of a local 3-coloring of an odd quadrangulation of small genus surfaces _ using 6 colors _ , whereas theorem  [ main](i ) states the same for an unlimited number of colors .",
    "if @xmath316 is a quadrangulation , we define the _ face subdivision _ @xmath317 of @xmath316 as the triangulation of the same surface that is obtained from @xmath316 by adding a vertex in each face and joining it to the four vertices on its boundary .",
    "the behavior of the local chromatic number exhibited in odd quadrangulations also shows up in their face subdivisions @xmath317 .",
    "it has been proved by hutchinson et al .",
    "@xcite that in an odd quadrangulation @xmath316 of the projective plane , a vertex coloring with any number of colors gives rise to a four - colored face",
    ". this has been generalized to odd quadrangulations of arbitrary non - orientable surfaces in @xcite ; for some further extensions see also @xcite .",
    "this shows that the face subdivision triangulation @xmath317 does not admit a local 4-coloring , and its local chromatic number is at least 5 .",
    "since all added vertices can be colored with the same color , we also conclude that @xmath318 .",
    "[ thm : t(g ) ] if @xmath316 is an odd quadrangulation of a non - orientable surface and @xmath317 is its face subdivision , then the local chromatic number of @xmath317 is at least five .",
    "there is another family of triangulations of surfaces that exhibits unusual chromatic behavior  a simple local condition forces the chromatic number to be at least 5 despite the fact that these graphs seem to be `` almost 3-colorable '' .",
    "let @xmath49 be a triangulation of some surface such that all its vertices except two have even degree , and the two vertices of odd degree are adjacent .",
    "fisk @xcite proved that @xmath49 can not be 4-colored .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.4 ) for further details .",
    "here we observe that the above result of fisk can be extended to local colorings as well .",
    "[ thm : fisk ] let @xmath49 be a triangulation of some surface such that all its vertices except two have even degree . if @xmath9 is a local @xmath0-coloring of @xmath49 , and @xmath22 and @xmath144 are the two vertices of odd degree , then @xmath319 and the set of three colors used on the neighbors of @xmath22 and of @xmath144 , respectively , is the same . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath144 are adjacent , then @xmath49 has local chromatic number at least five .    * proof . * we may assume that @xmath320 .",
    "for every @xmath321 , let @xmath322 be the set of facial triangles whose vertices are colored @xmath323 , and let @xmath324 be the set of vertices of color @xmath120 that are incident with a triangle in @xmath322 .    if @xmath325 , then the set of facial triangles containing @xmath6 determines a cycle @xmath173 ( the _ link _ of @xmath6 ) passing through all the neighbors of @xmath6 . since @xmath9 is a local 4-coloring , it determines a 3-coloring of @xmath173 , which can be viewed as a mapping of @xmath173 onto the cycle @xmath326 of length 3 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the winding number of this mapping .",
    "since @xmath326 has an odd number of edges , it follows that @xmath327 this simple conclusion implies that the parity of the number of triangles in @xmath322 can be expressed as follows : @xmath328 there are distinct colors @xmath323 such that @xmath329 and @xmath330 . the second congruence in ( [ eq : eij ] )",
    "can hold only when @xmath331 since @xmath22 and @xmath144 are the only vertices of odd degree and the sum of degrees of vertices in @xmath332 is even .",
    "this shows that @xmath22 and @xmath144 have the same color and the same set of colors in their neighborhood .",
    "quadrangulations can be classified into four types according to the homology of their odd cycles .",
    "let us describe this refined classification of even / odd quadrangulations more closely .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph that is embedded in a surface @xmath18 such that all facial walks are of even length .",
    "then it is easy to see that the lengths of any two closed walks in @xmath2 that are homologous ( with respect to the @xmath40-homology @xmath333 ) have the same parity .",
    "the parities of walks in different homology classes thus determine a homomorphism @xmath334 , which is called the _ cycle parity map _ of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath18 is a non - orientable surface of genus @xmath164 , then it is homeomorphic to the connected sum of @xmath164 projective planes @xmath335 , and its homology group @xmath336 is generated by 1-sided cycles @xmath337 in @xmath338 , @xmath339 . in particular , @xmath340 can be _ represented _ by the @xmath164-tuple @xmath341 , where @xmath342 if @xmath338 contains a closed walk in @xmath2 of odd length , and @xmath343 otherwise .",
    "if @xmath344 and @xmath345 , then we can replace the chosen basis @xmath346 of the homology group by @xmath347 , @xmath348 , @xmath349 , and @xmath350 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath351 can be represented by disjoint 1-sided simple closed curves in @xmath18 that generate @xmath333 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath340 is a homomorphism , it follows that the parity map representation changes from @xmath352 to @xmath353 under the new generating set .",
    "this shows that there is a representation of @xmath340 in one ( and precisely one ) of the following four forms : @xmath354 we say that @xmath2 is of type @xmath355 ( @xmath356 ) if its cycle parity map can be represented by @xmath355 .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite for a similar treatment with more details .",
    "it is clear from the definition that @xmath316 is of type @xmath357 if and only if every 1-sided closed walk has odd length .",
    "( it is a corollary of this that every 2-sided closed walk has even length . )",
    "let us observe that the quadrangulation @xmath294 of the genus 5 non - orientable surface constructed in section [ sec : const ] is of type @xmath357 .",
    "this can be proved as follows .",
    "first we observe that @xmath294 can be represented by means of local rotations and the signature ( cf .",
    "the edges of negative signature are the following ones : @xmath358 if we remove all these edges , we get a bipartite spanning subgraph @xmath359 of @xmath294 , and each removed edge joins two vertices that belong to the same bipartite class in @xmath359 .",
    "this shows that all 1-sided closed walks ( i.e. those that traverse an odd number of edges with negative signature ) in @xmath294 have odd length .",
    "thus , @xmath294 is of type @xmath357 .",
    "we have shown that odd quadrangulations of non - orientable surfaces of genus at most four have local chromatic number at least four and that for every surface of genus at least five , there are examples for which this no longer holds .",
    "let us observe that a quadrangulation is odd if and only if it is either of type @xmath360 ( for arbitrary genus ) or it is of type @xmath357 when the genus is odd .",
    "as shown above , our example @xmath294 of an odd quadrangulation of genus 5 that admits a local 3-coloring is of type @xmath357 .",
    "when producing quadrangulations of higher genera , we can switch to type @xmath360 ( by repeatedly inserting three diagonals into hexagonal faces as done in the proof of theorem [ main](ii ) ) .",
    "but we can also stay within the type @xmath357 by taking a quadrangulation of type @xmath357 of odd genus @xmath164 that admits a local 3-coloring , such that on two adjacent faces only two colors are used , and then replace those two faces by making a connected sum with a 3-colorable quadrangulation ( minus an edge @xmath20 ) of the klein bottle of type @xmath361 in which the two faces sharing the edge @xmath20 are 2-colored .",
    "this gives a quadrangulation of genus @xmath362 of type @xmath357 that admits a local 3-coloring , and leaves only one unresolved case ",
