    "several cosmological observations show that our universe is expanding with an acceleration@xcite .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as a dominance of the energy of the unknown nature , so called _ dark energy _",
    "( de)@xcite .",
    "the main feature of this energy consists of negative pressure that leads to an accelerated expansion .",
    "the standard cosmological scenario implies that order of 75% of the total energy density is present in the form of de .",
    "there are several observational data based indications that de is highly spatial uniform and isotropic , as well as that the de became dominant recently .",
    "definitely the nature of de is one of major puzzles of modern cosmology@xcite .",
    "a lot of theories of de have been proposed@xcite .",
    "the simplest model of de is the @xmath1cdm model , called a _ concordance model _",
    ", that assumes that the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the presence of a cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "this model fits well the cosmological observations , but the @xmath1cdm model has the coincidence and the fine tuning still unexplained problems@xcite .    instead of the considering the cosmological constant model",
    "there were several models proposed in which de is a dynamical quantity and in these models de is associated with a _ dynamical scalar field _ . for the @xmath1cdm model",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is a pressure and @xmath4 is an energy density of the de ) is a constant and it equals to minus one , whilst for the dynamical scalar field models the equation of state parameter is a time varying function@xcite .",
    "depending on the value of the equation of state parameter at present , the time dependent de models are divided into the phantom models@xcite ( @xmath5 ) and the _ quintessence models_@xcite ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the quintessence models are subdivided into two classes : the thawing models and the freezing ( or tracking ) ones.@xcite    in the tracking or freezing ( slow roll ) quintessence model the form of the potential allows the attractor in the late - time evolution of the scalar field be insensitive to the initial conditions , and allows the scalar field energy density to track the matter energy density in the matter domination epoch and then the radiation energy density in the radiation domination epoch , remaining subdominant during these epochs . and only at late times , the scalar field becomes dominant and starts behaving like a component with a negative pressure driving the acceleration of the universe .",
    "thus the quintessence models can clarify the coincidence problem .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the freezing quintessence model with an inverse power law ratra - peebles potential@xcite : @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a model parameter , defining the steepness of the potential ; @xmath9 is a scalar field amplitude .    in order to distinguish between different dynamical de models commonly constraint of energy equation of state @xmath10",
    "is used , because different models of de give different low of @xmath10 .",
    "recent supernova legacy survey three year sample ( snls3 ) combining with other data on cmb , bao and hubble constant measurement gives rise to @xmath11 for constant of @xmath12 in standard @xmath13 models @xcite .",
    "the bao measurements the values of the equation of state parameter @xmath10 ( @xmath14 is a redshift ) and its redshift derivative @xmath15 is the primary goal of the ongoing de experiments such as snls3 , vipers or boss , but only the next generation of the large scale redshift surveys at @xmath16 and beyond this limit of the redshift like euclid@xcite , wfirst or bigboss@xcite will be able to provide the data to distinguish the de models from each other .",
    "we can get many information about the dynamical de models analyzing the growth of the matter perturbations which were obtained from the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) surveys .",
    "the classical quintessence models are not clustered , but they affect the rate of the matter evolution , therefore the different de models predict the different growth rate history @xcite .",
    "there are a lot of observational growth rate data@xcite , but all these ongoing and future experiments are dedicated to the measurements in the range of the redshifts @xmath17 .",
    "the main goal of our research is the estimation of the sensitivity of the bao and the rsd data to the cosmological parameters , especially to the values @xmath18 and the @xmath19 in the range of the redshifts @xmath20 .",
    "also we have explored what volume and number of the galaxies will be necessary to compete with the other surveys in the range of the redshifts @xmath20 .    in this paper we will develop this ideas in quintessence model with ratra - peebles potential , that was well studied in many papers@xcite .",

    "the influence of the scalar field ( of the ratra - peebles potential ) on growth of structure was well investigated in many papers@xcite .",

    "we have neglected the radiation term in the calculations because it is not relevant during the late stage expansion of the universe .",

    "in order to estimate the precision of the constraints of the value of the @xmath8 parameter , we have found the response of the different cosmological tests on the change of the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "for this purpose we have considered three kinds of cosmological tests which differ by their response on the change of the background dynamics and of the growth rate of the large scale structure :    1 .   _",

    "@xmath20 the distance measurement of the @xmath53 is the most sensitive . however , these conclusions are based on the assumption that the present day values of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath66 are evaluated perfectly well . since this is not the case , to verify the existence of the quintessence is necessary to investigate the differences between the measured values and the corresponding values of ones for the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "in general , this problem should be solved by the mcmc simulations of observations for a set of different cosmological models , but for the better understanding it is instructive to analyze the two limiting cases .",
