    "an open discussion forum was conducted recently at alife vii to draw up a list of open problems that might guide the field of artificial life in the coming years , styled on the famous hilbert problems that guided much of mathematics in the 20th century .",
    "the resulting list@xcite contains 14 open problems , divided into 3 categories : how does life arise from the non - living ; what are the potentials and limits of living systems ; how is life related to mind , machine and culture .",
    "the issue of _ open - ended evolution _ can be summed up by asking under what conditions will an evolutionary system continue to produce novel forms . artificial life systems such as tierra and",
    "avida produced a rich diversity of organisms initially , yet ultimately peter out.@xcite by contrast , the earth s biosphere appears to have continuously generated new and varied forms throughout the @xmath0 years of the history of life .",
    "there is also a clear trend from simple organisms at the time of the first replicators towards immensely complicated organisms such as mammals and birds found on the earth today .",
    "this raises the obvious question of _ what is missing _ in artificial life systems ?",
    "this issue is touched on most directly in problem 6  `` what is inevitable in open - ended evolution of life '' , but in fact is intimately connected with problems 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 also .",
    "the issue of complexity growth is related to that of open - endedness .",
    "complexity is related to information in a direct manner,@xcite in a way to be made more precise later in this paper .",
    "loosely speaking , available complexity is proportional to the dimension of phenotype space , and an evolutionary process that remained at low levels of complexity will quickly exhaust the possibilities for novel forms .",
    "however , intuitively , one would expect the number of novel forms to increase exponentially with available complexity , and so perhaps increasing complexity might cease to be important factor in open - ended evolution beyond a certain point .",
    "of course , it is by far from proven that the number of possible forms increases as rapidly with complexity as that , so it may still be that complexity growth is essential for continual novelty .    for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we will examine the possibilities for open - ended growth in complexity in artificial life , since this most closely resembles the evolution of our biosphere .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that the biosphere is subject to the _ anthropic principle_@xcite while no artificial life model is .",
    "whether this fact is important in the generation of complexity is a question worthy of artificial life studies .",
    "results will also be reported of an experiment to measure the complexity of tierran organisms . whilst it is widely believed that the version of tierra used here does not exhibit open ended complexity growth , the tierran team are hoping to produce a version of _ network tierra _ that does .",
    "the importance of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of these sorts of experiments on simple alife systems , before attempting more complex ones .",
    "the concept of _ complexity _ as a measurable quantity has been subject to a lot of debate .",
    "this is particularly due to the fact that there are numerous ways of ordering things based on physical quantities that agree with our subjective notion of complexity , within particular application environments .",
    "examples include organism size , numbers of parts and number of different cell types in the arena of complexity of animals , to name just a few.@xcite a good discussion of these different types can be found in edmonds.@xcite unfortunately , these measures typically do not extend to other application areas , where most of the complexity may be encoded in the connections between the parts , or in the levels of hierarchy .",
    "there is , however , a unifying concept that covers all notions of measurable complexity , and that is _",
    "information_. information was first quantified in the landmark work of shannon@xcite in the late 1940s , however in this case the semantic content of information was ignored , since the purpose was to measure the capacities of communication channels .",
    "the next theoretical step occurred in the 1960s with the advent of _ algorithmic complexity _ , also known as _",
    "kolmogorov complexity_.@xcite in algorithmic complexity , the complexity of a description is defined to be the length of the shortest program that can generate the description , when run on a particular _ universal turing machine _ ( utm ) .",
    "this complexity is closely related to the shannon entropy in the following way .",
    "consider the set of all infinite length descriptions expressed as binary strings .",
    "a halting program of length @xmath1 will be equivalent to all infinite length descriptions having the same prefix of length @xmath1 , and so will have probability @xmath2 of being picked at random from the set of all descriptions .",
    "this gives rise to the so called _ universal prior measure _",
    ", defined as@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reference universal turing machine , and @xmath5 is the length of program @xmath6 . the shannon entropy computed using this probability distribution differs from the algorithmic complexity by at most a constant that depends only on the turing machines chosen , not the description .",
    "* coding theorem 4.3.3 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the algorithmic complexity of @xmath9 .",
    "there are two key problems with algorithmic complexity .",
    "the first is the arbitrariness of the reference turing machine @xmath4 .",
    "the second relates to the behaviour of random strings  the algorithmic complexity of a random string is at least as great as the string length itself , ie has maximal complexity .",
    "this is in conflict with our common sense notion of random strings having no information at all.@xcite    the first problem is really a non - problem .",
    "all information is _ context dependent _ , with the context being defined by the receiver or interpreter of a message .",
    "see adami@xcite for an explicit discussion of this issue . in the case of algorithmic complexity , the interpreter is the reference utm , which must be agreed upon in the context of the discussion .    the second issue can be dealt with by broadening the concept of algorithmic complexity in the following way:@xcite given an interpreter of information that defines the context , the interpreter must classify all possible messages into a countable , possibly finite set of valid meanings .",
    "the utm classifies messages into equivalent programs .",
    "a human interpreter will have a somewhat different scheme of classifying things .",
    "with respect to the particular issue of random strings , a human being will classify all random strings as identical  all gibberish .",
    "the obvious generalisation of complexity is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the complexity ( measured in bits ) , @xmath12 the size of the alphabet used to encode the description and @xmath13 the size of the class of all descriptions equivalent to @xmath9 and of length less than @xmath14 .",
    "this definition allows for infinite strings to be measured , provided the above limit exists .",
    "random strings are dense in the set of all possible strings , so @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "random strings have zero complexity .    to see that this definition of @xmath11 converges for finite descriptions ( ie ones for which the interpreter `` halts '' and gives an interpretation after a fixed number @xmath17 characters ) , note that all strings having the same @xmath17 character prefix are equivalent",
    ". therefore , @xmath18 , so @xmath19 .",
    "equality only holds iff @xmath9 is incompressible .    in the case where the interpreter is the utm @xmath4 ,",
    "each finite prefix bitstring @xmath6 equivalent to @xmath9 contributes @xmath20 to @xmath13 .",
    "so @xmath21 so @xmath11 reduces to the usual complexity measure in equation ( [ utm complexity ] ) .",
    "now that complexity has been defined in a general sense , we need to work out an appropriate context for discussing the complexity of tierran organisms .",
    "tierra is an artificial life system created by tom ray@xcite where the artificial organisms are computer programs written in a special assembler - like language .",
    "the equivalence principle for defining the context is phenotypic equivalence , ie when two tierran organisms behave identically , even if they contain a different sequence of instructions .",
    "adami s group pioneered this technique with _ avida_,@xcite a similar artificial life system inspired by tierra . in avida",
    ", the situation is particularly simple , as organisms have only one phenotypic characteristic , namely their reproduction rate . to make matters more interesting",
    ", the avida group set the creatures a range of computational tasks to attempt  success at these tasks is rewarded by extra cpu resources .",
    "the success or otherwise of the creatures at these tasks further distinguishes between avida phenotypes .",
    "tierra presents considerably greater difficulties than avida in that tierran organisms can _ interact _ with each other via template matches or simply `` falling off the end of the code '' .",
    "so , the tierra phenotype can be categorised by examining the interactions between all possible phenotypes .",
    "since genotype space is so huge , what better way of searching for viable phenotypes than using a genetic algorithm , namely taking the results from a long tierra run .",
    "these are then pitted against each other in pairwise tournaments@xcite in a specially crafted simulator called _",
    "minitierra_@xcite that can perform the tournament nearly 1000 times faster than tierra itself .",
    "once all the tournaments have been completed , the organisms are sorted into phenotypically equivalent classes , resulting in a small list of 26 archetypal organisms .",
    "these are labeled by the genotype with the earliest creation date .",
    "table [ archetypes ] lists the archetypes , along with their creation time , non - volatile site count ( to be explained later ) and measured entropy .",
    "having now established an archetype list , we need to estimate the density of neutrally equivalent genotypes in genotype space in order to apply the complexity formula ( [ complexity ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , simply sampling the whole of genotype space is computation infeasible , as the overall density is low  an organism having complexity of 60 instructions ( 300 bits ) will have a density of @xmath22 requiring many more samples than there are nanoseconds in the history of the universe .",
    "we can , however , explore the _ neutral network _ of phenotypic equivalents connected by single mutations .",
    "unfortunately , this also is computationally infeasible  take our previous example of an organism of length 80 instructions , having a complexity of 60 instructions .",
    "the neutrally equivalent set will have size @xmath23 genotypes , each of which needs to be checked .",
    "what we can do is a hybrid method : begin by exploring the neutral network out to a certain cutoff value ( usually 2 hops in this experiment , however several of the cheaper organisms were computed to higher cutoff value to check on convergence ) . where the network is thickly branching ,",
    "perform a monte - carlo style sampling of that subspace , since this is likely to correspond to part of the genome that contains little information . where the network has only a few branches",
    ", then continue following the network branches .",
    "the threshold between the two strategies is determined by some heuristic estimates of how expensive each approach is likely to be .",
    "basically the density of neutral variants in a genotype subspace is assumed to be proportional to the number of immediate neutral neighbours in that subspace .",
    "this then entails both the cost of traversing the network ( which rises exponentially with neutral density ) and the cost of performing monte carlo sampling , which falls with increasing neutral density .",
    "the code and data used for this experiment is available from .",
    "the use of the software is briefly documented in the readme file .",
    "we end up with a probabilistic estimate of the density of phenotypic equivalents , and hence the complexity by ( [ complexity ] )",
    ". this estimate should converge as more of the neutral network is searched .",
    "since the first thing to compute is the number of nearest neutral neighbours at each site , a simple complexity estimate can be found : classify sites as hot if every possible mutation leaves the organism neutrally equivalent , and cold if any mutation changes the phenotype .",
    "the number of cold sites could be called the _ non - volatile site count _",
    ", denoted @xmath24 .",
    "a slightly more sophisticated calculation is to compute @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of mutations at site @xmath27 on the genome that lead to differing phenotypes , which we can call the _ single site entropy_. for a completely cold site , @xmath28 , and for a hot site @xmath29 .",
    "formula ( [ sse ] ) takes into account shades of grey in `` site temperature '' .",
    "_ use this measurement in their work.@xcite equation ( [ sse ] ) is clearly an underestimate of the amount of complexity defined in ( [ complexity ] ) , as is the non - volatile site count .",
    "table [ archetypes ] shows the creation time ( in millions of instructions ) , computed single site entropies and complexity measures estimated by truncating the neutral network at two hops ( denoted @xmath30 ) for each of the phenotypes found in this sample run .",
    "figure [ tierra - info - fig ] shows the same results in graphical form , with the creation time plotted along the horizontal axis , and the organism length , non - volatile site count @xmath24 and @xmath30 plotted as separate points .",
    "there are several key points to note :    * over this tierra run of @xmath31 instructions , there is no sign of complexity increase , although lengths of the organisms do increase from 80 initially to 526 instructions long by @xmath32 instructions executed .",
    "cpu resources are divided amongst the organisms in a _ size neutral _ fashion ( ie proportional to organism size ) to allow this growth in genome size to happen .",
    "this is not an especially lengthy tierra run , however , and perhaps real complexity takes much longer accumulate in the junk parts of the genome .",
    "* the non - volatile site count @xmath24 is a good proxy measure of the total complexity .",
    "the biggest discrepancy in this database occurred for 0194aag , and the real complexity was only 58% higher .",
    "this is good news , as it is far more tractable to compute @xmath24 , than the full complexity . the full @xmath30 computation for this dataset of organisms required nearly 8 cpu years of contemporary processor time , as opposed to about 3 cpu hours for @xmath24 .",
    "fortunately , it is a highly parallel problem , and was computed within about 3 months on a major high performance computing facility . *",
    "the precise definition of the _ phenotype _ has a big influence over complexity values .",
    "as has been argued by adami@xcite and myself,@xcite this is highly context dependent .",
    "no particular definition is wrong _ per se _ , however some definitions will be better than others .",
    "i hope , dear reader , you consider my definition based on pairwise ecological interactions to be a good definition , and that therefore the complexity measures obtained are useful .",
    "it is known that tierran organisms can exhibit what is called _",
    "social hyperparasitism_.@xcite this is necessarily a 3-way interaction between tierran organisms  _ hyperparasitism _ refers to stealing another organism s cpu to reproduce itself , and _ social _ refers to the fact that multiple organisms must cooperate to perform this feat .",
    "however both of these properties show up as distinct patterns amongst 2 way interactions - the hyperparasite still manages to interfere with its prey s reproductive capability , even if it is unable to gain from the act alone , and mutual interaction with members of its own kind show up also .",
