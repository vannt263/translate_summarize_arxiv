    "m82 was observed with a total on - source time of 5.0 hours on 21 february 2013 with the lofar low - band antenna ( lba ; @xmath21 ) stations , as part of early science ( cycle 0 ) data obtained for the lofar survey of nearby galaxies ( lc0_043 , pi : r. beck ) .",
    "we used 13 remote and 24 core stations for this observation , giving baselines between 90  m and 85  km .",
    "each lba station contains 96 dual polarization dipole antennas , 48 of which can be used simultaneously , and has a total radius of @xmath22 .",
    "we used the lba_outer configuration , where the outermost more sparsely spaced 48 antennas in each station record data .",
    "this configuration has a reduced field of view compared to other configurations , and mitigates the problem of mutual coupling between closely spaced antennas , providing slightly increased sensitivity .",
    "each dual - polarization dipole antenna provides four linear correlation products which were used to reconstruct stokes i images .",
    "we obtained complete frequency coverage between 30 and 78  mhz with 1  s time resolution .",
    "this bandwidth was divided in 244 subbands , each 0.1953  mhz wide , and further subdivided into 128 channels , resulting in channel widths ranging from 616  km  s@xmath23 . using the total available bandwidth of 488 subbands and the multibeam capability of lofar we simultaneously observed the calibrator source 3c196 with identical frequency coverage .",
    "the calibrator data were processed by the observatory pipeline , starting by flagging radio frequency interference ( rfi ) with the aoflagger @xcite .",
    "typically , a few percent of the data were flagged due to rfi , consistent with a study of the lofar rfi environment @xcite .",
    "the calibrator data were then averaged to 16 channels and 6 seconds before calibration with the blackboard selfcal software system @xcite .",
    "the target data were flagged with the aoflagger , averaged to 6 seconds and 32 channels and the amplitude calibration obtained from 3c196 was applied .",
    "the velocity sampling of the individual subbands in target data after averaging ranges from @xmath24 .    for imaging we selected only the 24 lofar core stations , which all observe with the same clock , making correction for time delays unnecessary .",
    "the proximity of the stations to each other also mitigates the chance of observing the target through severely different ionospheric conditions .",
    "image cubes of a region with an area of @xmath25 degree@xmath26 centred on m82 were made with awimager @xcite , imaging and cleaning each channel individually .",
    "we used briggs weighting @xcite with a robust value of 0.0 to create images with resolutions ranging between @xmath27arcsec@xmath28 and @xmath29arcsec@xmath28 . at this resolution m82",
    "is unresolved .",
    "low resolution imaging parameters were deliberately chosen to speed up the computationally expensive imaging process .",
    "lofar does not support doppler tracking so we have doppler - corrected the data post imaging . in total we imaged 69 subbands in the range 50 - 64",
    "mhz , centred on the peak response of the lba @xcite .",
    "we extracted the spatially integrated spectra from elliptical apertures , where the appropriate elliptical dimensions in each subband were determined by fitting a 2d gaussian to the point source in the centre and using the curve - of - growth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) to select an aperture size that captured the total flux density of the point source but did not include nearby background sources .",
    "we calculated the standard deviation for each subband and implemented automatic removal of subbands with excessively large standard deviations ( @xmath30 ) , verified by visual inspection .",
    "five subbands were removed from further processing .",
    "we inspected each subband for individual detections of lines , which were not seen . in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we stacked crrl @xmath4-transitions ( @xmath31 , for @xmath32 ) to form an average line profile .     +      maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio of",
    "a stacked line profile requires precisely stacking the centres of each individual line , which requires an accurate radial velocity ( redshift ) . while the systemic velocity of m82 has been measured as @xmath33 relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) ,",
    "observations show that even in the nuclear region there is a spread of @xmath34 in velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we constrained the velocity for the crrl absorbing gas by cross - correlating a spectral template of crrls ( using gaussian line profiles at known crrl frequencies ) with the entire observed spectrum over a range of redshifts .",
    "the template line peaks were normalised to a value of @xmath7 . for the less certain line width parameter , we ran a series of models with different line widths , starting at @xmath35 ( to avoid cross - correlating with noise peaks ) . the magnitude of the cross - correlation peaks at @xmath36 relative to the lsr ( optical velocity ) , and we iterated with a template that only contains subbands for which rest - frame crrls would appear at this redshift .",
    "this reduces the amount of noise which is cross - correlated , very slightly improving the definition of the peak of the cross - correlation .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows a clear peak in the cross - correlation at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , consistent with the systemic velocity of m82 , and we used this to stack our lines .",
    "we did not find evidence for crrl features at either of the velocities of the two secondary peaks , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "requiring that rest - frame crrl frequencies be at least six channels away from the edge of a subband to avoid problems with noisy edge channels , we find that twenty - three subbands have @xmath4-transitions .",
    "we clipped the first and last three edge channels and converted to optical velocity using the rest frequency of the crrl within the subband .",
    "after blanking @xmath41 around the expected velocity of the crrl , we fitted the continuum in each subband individually with a low ( first or second ) order polynomial .",
    "we also tried blanking different ranges around the line , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , without seeing substantial differences in the final spectrum . for one subband , any blanking left continuum only on one side of the line ,",
    "so we did not include this subband in the final stack .",
    "each subband was continuum subtracted .",
    "the final spectrum was constructed from the individual points of 22 subbands , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "the final stacked spectrum has a velocity sampling of @xmath44 within approximately @xmath45 of the measured velocity ( @xmath46 , lsr ) .",
    "the measurement error of each point is equal to the standard deviation of the continuum in the subband from which the point originates .",
    "the weighted standard deviation of the continuum in the final spectrum within approximately @xmath45 of the expected crrl line centre is @xmath47 , which is approximately @xmath48 smaller than the average noise in a subband .    .",
    "from top to bottom : the complete reconstructed spectrum ; the portion of the spectrum with dense velocity coverage ; the normalised density of points in the spectrum .",
    "the red dashed line in the top two panels represents the continuum.[fig : f3],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    galactic crrls show peak optical depths of @xmath49 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the crrls in m82 have similar peak optical depths then these would be within the noise of this spectrum .",
    "we therefore used a low - pass savitzky - golay filter ( sgf ; * ? ? ? * ) which is a special case of a least - squares ( ls ) smoothing function that convolves the data with a filter whose shape is dependent on the polynomial order used for fitting .",
    "other filtering methods ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ) produced similar line profiles .",
    "after testing sgf filter widths from 15 to 60 data points for both first and second order polynomials , we selected an sgf with a width of 31 data points , which provided the flattest continuum . within approximately @xmath50 of the feature in the final , smoothed spectrum , the standard deviation of the continuum is @xmath51 , in good agreement with our expectations from the raw spectrum noise and filter window size .",
    "we assessed this filtering method with modelled spectra and found that the integrated line profile is preserved within the errors even after introducing gaussian noise .",
    "radial velocities within the nuclear region range from @xmath52 .",
    "the centroid of the crrl feature is therefore consistent with an absorption feature associated with the centre of the nuclear region .",
    "the cross - correlation is already strong evidence that the feature does not arise merely from a chance alignment of noise , since the feature only arises from a location where we know there to be gas , which is necessary but not sufficient for crrls .",
    "to rule out other possibilities , we conducted a series of tests .",
    "we used a ` jack - knife ' procedure where we re - stacked the subbands , each time leaving out an individual subband .",
    "none of the stacks produced a significant change to the absorption feature , confirming that the stacked spectrum is not dominated by one subband .",
    "additionally , we stacked the subbands after introducing random velocity shifts to each subband before stacking , and were unable to produce any credible features .",
    "spectra extracted from the background sky also do not show an absorption feature when stacked . from these tests ,",
    "we conclude that our feature is real and associated with the m82 starburst galaxy .",
    "we tried to detect crrl @xmath53-transitions ( @xmath54 ) , without success .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the crrl @xmath53-transitions are expected to have integrated optical depths that are only @xmath55 that of the @xmath4-transitions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we did not find evidence for local crrls at @xmath56 . a search for hydrogen rrls , both locally and at the redshift of m82 , was also unproductive .",
    "this is unsurprising as these are believed to be very weak at these frequencies ( e.g. , salgado et al . in preparation",
    "we stacked the spectra to search for crrls in m82 using our measured velocity , @xmath37 , and detect carbon @xmath4-transition rrls with a combined signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath6 in the filtered spectrum .",
    "the central absorption feature can be fitted by a four parameter gaussian profile with a depth of @xmath57 , a fwhm of @xmath58 , a centre of @xmath59 , and an additive offset of @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "other absorption features have been observed in m82 with similarly narrow widths .",
    "@xcite observed p - h@xmath61o absorption ( in the far infrared ) with a fwhm of @xmath62 , although this is offset from the crrl absorption by @xmath63 .",
    "additionally , a narrow component results if we limit the reconstruction of the absorption profile in the direction of snrs in the nucleus of m82 to only the handful of bright snrs which are relatively unaffected by free - free absorption at low frequencies . we constructed the absorption line profiles from measurements in @xcite .",
    "we interpolated the spectra ( mjy / bm ) in the direction of each of the 26 snrs which show absorption onto a velocity grid with @xmath64 resolution using a cubic spline function .",
    "addition of the individual spectra produces a combined spectrum with information in the direction of snrs . for the low frequency spectrum ,",
    "we cross matched the snrs in table 1 of @xcite with those still seen by lofar at @xmath65 ( varenius et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the eight snrs from @xcite that have measured absorption and are @xmath66 at 154 mhz are listed in that paper as 39.10 + 57.3 , 39.40 + 56.1 , 39.77 + 56.9 , 42.53 + 61.9 , 43.31 + 59.2 , 45.74 + 65.2 , 45.89 + 63.8 , and 46.52 + 63.9 .",
    "both of these absorption profiles show broader , shallower structure to either side of a deep , central feature , of which we see hints in the reconstructed crrl profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) .",
    "galactic observations show a correlation between crrls and ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is unsurprising that this correlation would also be present in m82 .    as fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] illustrates , integration of other tracers of interstellar gas over the disk of m82 leads to fwhm in excess of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this leads us to expect a broad component of the crrl profile , although the signal to noise coupled with the fixed velocity coverage and location of crrls in the subbands makes this difficult to ascertain .",
    "the overall crrl profile follows the low - frequency line profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the crrl absorbing gas is preferentially observed in front of those continuum sources that are still bright at low frequencies .",
    "the continuum offset and low - level absorption features in the crrl spectrum also show reasonable agreement with the absorbing gas , indicating that possibly we are observing a widespread crrl component associated with cold , diffuse throughout m82 .",
    "integrating the line profile gives @xmath68 . to constrain physical parameters of the gas , i.e. temperature and density",
    ", a single measurement is not enough .",
    "additional measurements at higher frequencies ( 100 - 400 mhz ) are necessary .",
    "we have presented the first detection of extragalactic carbon radio recombination lines , in m82 , using early science ( cycle 0 ) observations with lofar . while we already know that cold , neutral gas exists in m82 from measurements , this is the first independent measurement of the atomic cnm .",
    "the narrow crrl line is at a velocity corresponding to the centre of m82 and the profile corresponds to the absorption feature seen in the spectrum .",
    "higher resolution , higher sensitivity studies of m82 at the same frequencies would help to confirm that this feature is indeed associated with the nuclear region , and potentially shed more light on the origin of the optical depth . to constrain the gas properties we need studies at higher frequencies , and we are working towards detecting crrls in the range of @xmath69 with lofar s high band antenna array .",
    "this discovery paves the way for future extragalactic crrl studies to trace the cnm throughout the formation and evolution of galaxies , and is the basis of a pilot survey for crrls in other extragalactic sources .",
