    "the fission phenomenon is a magnificent example of a quantal large - amplitude collective motion during which the nucleus evolves in a multidimensional space representing shapes with different geometries , often tunneling through a classically - forbidden region @xcite .",
    "understanding the fission process is crucial for many areas of science and technology .",
    "for instance , fission governs the existence of many transuranium elements , including the predicted long - lived super - heavy species . in nuclear astrophysics",
    ", fission influences the formation of heavy elements in a very high neutron density environment .",
    "fission applications are numerous .",
    "for instance , improved understanding of the fission process will enable scientists to enhance the safety and reliability of nuclear reactors .",
    "while in the past the design , construction , and operation of reactors were supported through empirical trials , the new phase in nuclear energy production is expected to rely heavily on advanced modeling and simulation capabilities utilizing massively parallel leadership - class computers .",
    "a comprehensive explanation of nuclear fission rooted in interactions between nucleons still eludes us , although self - consistent approaches based on the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) have recently demonstrated that a microscopic description has a potential for both qualitative and quantitative description of fission data @xcite . a starting point in the adiabatic approach to fission",
    "is the capability to compute accurate multidimensional potential energy surfaces ( pes ) , and use them to predict observables such as fission half - lives and fragment mass distributions .",
    "this work has been stimulated by recent experiments on beta - delayed fission in the mercury - lead region @xcite and the discovery of asymmetric fission of the nucleus @xmath0hg .",
    "such an outcome has not been initially anticipated , as the symmetric fission channel involving two semi - magic @xmath7zr fragments was believed to dominate the process .",
    "it has been generally expected that the asymmetric fission is not important below @xmath10th @xcite , in particular in pre - actinide nuclei with high - lying saddle - point configurations that depend weakly on shell effects @xcite . moreover , the data on mass distributions of fragments in the low - energy fission of nuclei with @xmath11 have demonstrated the strong presence of the symmetric fission mode @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nucleus @xmath1hg has been observed to exhibit a fairly broad mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the explanation of the asymmetric fission around @xmath0hg has been offered by the macroscopic - microscopic model @xcite and its extension @xcite in terms of an asymmetric fission pathway that is separated by a potential - energy ridge from the symmetric @xmath7zr+@xmath7zr fusion valley .",
    "these results have emphasized the importance of shell effects between fission saddle and scission in pre - actinide nuclei ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .        in this work ,",
    "we extend the theoretical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite using the self - consistent nuclear dft .",
    "we explain the transition from the asymmetric fission in @xmath0hg @xcite to a more symmetric situation in @xmath1hg @xcite in terms of shell effects .",
    "we compare the fission pathways in both nuclei and discuss the interplay between fission and fusion valleys .",
    "finally , by studying density distributions of fragments , we demonstrate that scission configurations of @xmath0hg and @xmath1hg can be understood in terms of molecular structures .",
    "the skyrme - hfb calculations were carried out using the framework previously discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the symmetry unrestricted dft solver hfodd @xcite capable of breaking all self - consistent symmetries of nuclear mean fields on the way to fission . to solve a constrained nonlinear hfb problem precisely , we employed the augmented lagrangian method @xcite .",
    "the nuclear energy density functional was approximated by the skm@xmath3 functional  @xcite in the particle - hole channel and the density - dependent mixed pairing interaction  @xcite in the particle - particle channel . to truncate the quasi - particle space of hfb",
    ", we adopted the quasiparticle - cut - off value of 60mev in the equivalent energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the pairing strengths were adjusted to reproduce the neutron and proton pairing gaps in @xmath12fm @xcite ; the resulting values are @xmath13mev@xmath14 and @xmath15mev@xmath14 .",
    "the stretched harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis of hfodd was composed of states having not more than @xmath16 quanta in either of the cartesian directions , and not more than 1140 states in total .",
    "our gogny calculations follow the framework described in refs .",
    "@xcite based on the axial gogny - hfb solver  @xcite and d1s parameter set @xcite .",
    "we used the stretched ho basis with @xmath17 ho shells along the symmetry axis and @xmath18 shells in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the oscillator length was adjusted at every calculation point .    to find the optimum trajectories in a multidimensional collective space , we constrain the nuclear collective coordinates associated with the multipole moments @xmath19 , by which we explore the main degrees of freedom related to elongation @xmath20 and reflection - asymmetry @xmath21 . in our symmetry unrestricted skyrme - hfb calculations",
    "we also explore the effects of triaxiality ( @xmath22 ) and necking @xmath23 . in our axial gogny calculations ,",
    "the scission configurations were studied by means of the neck coordinate @xmath24 defined through the gaussian - type operator @xmath25 $ ] with @xmath26fm and @xmath27 chosen to describe the neck region ( e.g. , @xmath28fm in @xmath0hg ) .",
    "@xmath24 describes the number of nucleons in a thin layer of thickness @xmath29 perpendicular to the symmetry axis placed at @xmath30 .",
    "large values of @xmath24 describe shapes with a thick neck . by decreasing @xmath24 one can approach the scission line . to obtain a pes , constrained hfb equations are solved to minimize the total energy of the system at each point in the collective space .",
    "as demonstrated earlier @xcite , exploring many collective coordinates makes it possible to identify saddle points  @xcite as the competing fission pathways are usually well separated when studied in more than one dimension .",

    "the reflection - asymmetric path , corresponding to elongated fission fragments ( aef ) of different masses and shapes , is branching away from the symmetric valley below @xmath31b , and it passes through the mass asymmetric scission point ( see fig .",

    "the difference between contour lines is 4mev .",
    "the effects due to triaxiality , known to impact inner fission barriers in the actinides , are negligible here . ]    in @xmath0hg , at large elongations , the aef path is strongly favored over reflection - symmetric configurations ( @xmath33 associated with elongated fragments ( sef ) and the symmetric compact fragment valley scf  marked in fig .  [",
    "fig1](a ) .",
    "the fusion valleys , both symmetric ( sfu ) and asymmetric ( afu ) appear very low in energy above @xmath34b ; they are associated with post - scission configurations in which the two fragments are well separated .",
    "since the fission process is adiabatic , sfu and afu are not expected to couple to aef , which has a very distinct compound configuration exhibiting a pronounced neck even at @xmath35b .",
    "the situation in @xmath1hg is qualitatively similar but the mass asymmetry along aef is significantly reduced , and the energy difference between aef and sef ( corresponding to @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) is small , i.e. , the pes is soft in the octupole direction as one approaches the saddle . in hfb - d1s calculations of fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , the energy balance between these two configurations is so fragile that a local transition from aef to sef , and back , is predicted at large deformations .",
    "this topography is consistent with a broad mass distribution of fission fragments observed in this nucleus .",
    "it is interesting to see that the magic structure of @xmath7zr manifests itself in a very low energy of sfu in @xmath0hg ( @xmath7zr+@xmath7zr ) in both models .",

    "the difference between contour lines is 0.5mev .",
    "note different @xmath38-scales in @xmath0hg and @xmath1hg plots . ]",
    "the properties of fission fragments are governed by the nature of scission configurations at which a nucleus splits @xcite .",
    "the scission point is not precisely defined in the models yielding leptodermous densities .",
    "we assume that a scission configuration corresponds to a well - defined thin neck , and for greater elongations the neck decreases and the binding energy rapidly drops due to the coulomb repulsion between the fragments . for the detailed analysis",
    ", the hypersurface of scission points in the collective space has to be computed @xcite . to get more insight into the mass distributions of fissioning hg nuclei , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the topography of pes for @xmath0hg and @xmath1hg obtained in hfb - d1s for pre - scission configurations around the aef valley .",
    "it is gratifying to see that the predictions of hfb - d1s and hfb - skm@xmath3 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) are similar .",
    "namely , in both cases the aef valley is separated by a ridge from the symmetric @xmath38=0 line ( sef ) for @xmath0hg , while for @xmath1hg the pre - scission surface is fairly soft in the @xmath38 direction , and the aef pathway corresponds to much smaller mass asymmetries .",
    "the profiles of the density distribution for various configurations are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the density profile corresponding to aef ( the most probable static scission point ) in @xmath0hg can be associated with a @xmath39=99/81 mass split , which is very consistent with the observed mass asymmetry of @xmath39=100(1)/80(1 ) @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the neck joining the two pre - fragments is located at 0.6fm from the center of mass .",
    "density distributions for higher - lying pre - scission configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) are all similar , with the heavier fragment being nearly spherical and the lighter fragment elongated .",
    "when moving closer to the @xmath36 line , we see that the neck is still pronounced and the fragments are elongated .",
    "that is , the symmetric configurations competing with aef do not correspond to the two spherical @xmath7zr nuclei .",
    "a very similar situation is obtained in hfb - skm@xmath3 , where the predicted mass split at the static scission point is @xmath39=101/79 , and in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath40 .",
    "the pre - scission shapes of @xmath1hg are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the mass split along aef is 108/90 and the minimum of the neck is located at about 1.7fm from the center of mass .",
    "interestingly , the heavier fragment is elongated while the lighter fragment is nearly spherical , i.e. , this is exactly opposite to what has been predicted for @xmath0hg . again , our hfb - skm@xmath3 calculations yield a very consistent result , @xmath39=110/88 , that is close to the mass split @xmath41111/87 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a ) shows the fission valley aef for @xmath0hg in hfb - d1s in the ( @xmath42 ) plane as the scission point ( small values of @xmath24 ) is gradually approached with increasing @xmath43 . for @xmath44b ,",
    "the configuration sfu corresponding to two separated @xmath7zr fragments lies above aef ( see also fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) . for @xmath45b",
    "an energy barrier appears between aef and sfu .",
    "moreover , as discussed above , a transition from aef to sfu is going to be strongly hindered by the very different intrinsic structure of these two configurations .",
    "we first considered the nuclei that ( i ) have the same @xmath46 ratio as the parent system ; ( ii ) have mass numbers that reproduce the doubled mass of the outer part of the fragment situated outside the vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ; and ( iii ) have density distributions that match those of the fragments .",
    "the detailed analysis of the shape of @xmath0hg in the near - scission configuration of aef with @xmath47b and @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b - d ) . since the nuclei @xmath7zr and",
    "@xmath49ge have the same @xmath46 ratio as @xmath0hg they are obvious candidates .",
    "the larger fragment of @xmath0hg has a nearly spherical shape .",
    "this is consistent with the ground - state of semi - magic @xmath7zr .",
    "the smaller fragment is strongly elongated .",
    "a deformed configuration of @xmath49ge with @xmath50b , at an excitation energy of 3.4 mev , fits the bill . by comparing the calculated density profiles",
    ", we see that the pre - scission configuration of @xmath0hg can indeed be viewed as a molecular system consisting of spherical @xmath7zr and deformed @xmath49ge fragments connected by a thin neck with a slightly reduced density that contains 8 protons and 10 neutrons . at scission",
    "the neck nucleons are shared between the two fragments .",
    "one likely split could be @xmath4ru/@xmath5kr .",
    "following similar analysis for @xmath1hg presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we conclude that its near - scission aef configuration can be viewed as a molecular system .",

    "therefore , one likely split could be @xmath6ru/@xmath7kr .",
    "our self - consistent calculations based on the nuclear dft with skm@xmath3 and d1s effective interactions give a very consistent description of the fission process in @xmath0hg and @xmath1hg . by considering several collective coordinates",
    ", we were able to follow static fission and fusion pathways in the configuration space .",
    "we confirm the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite that the asymmetric fission valley aef is well separated from fusion valleys associated with nearly spherical fragments .",
    "we conclude that the mass distribution of fission fragments in both nuclei is governed by shell structure of pre - scission configurations associated with molecular structures . in @xmath0hg ,",
    "both our models suggest @xmath4ru/@xmath5kr as the most probable split  a finding that is very consistent with experiment  and both predict symmetric elongated configurations sef to lie rather high in energy .",

    "both models yield pes for this nucleus to be fairly soft in the @xmath38 direction in a pre - scission region , and this is expected to result in an increased yield of nearly - symmetric partitions , and yield a very shallow , or even two - humped , structure seen experimentally @xcite .",
