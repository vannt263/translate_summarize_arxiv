    "<S> cdf recently measured the quantity @xmath0 , from which we determine the ratio @xmath1 to be @xmath2 . in this note , we show that the ratio @xmath1 obtained by dividing the @xmath3 by the leading order @xmath4 is consistent with this derived cdf measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the cross section @xmath3 using the perturbative qcd fragmentation functions of braaten , cheung , and yuan and the corresponding induced gluon fragmentation functions , with the charm - quark mass @xmath5 as a parameter . </S>",

    "<S> charmed - beauty meson ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most impressive is the result by cdf , which established a signal of @xmath7 ( from a null hypothesis ) , using the semi - leptonic decay channels of the @xmath6 meson , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> cdf measured the ratio @xmath10 where in @xmath11 the branching ratios for @xmath12 and @xmath13 are assumed equal , and the last error comes from the error in the measurement of the @xmath6 lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> based on the following data from particle data book @xcite @xmath14 and a theoretical calculation @xcite @xmath15 we are able to deduce this ratio @xmath16 where the error is obtained by adding the relative errors in quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> note that the ratio @xmath17 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) quoted in particle data book represents the fraction of @xmath18 that hadronizes into a @xmath19 meson , which was measured at lep . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction is , to a good approximation , independent of @xmath20 cuts . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ratio @xmath1 that we obtained in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bcfrag ] ) represents the ratio of the cross section of @xmath21 to the cross section of @xmath18 under the same @xmath20 cut as the cdf measurement @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio has no direct implication that @xmath21 meson is produced directly from @xmath18 , which is in contrast to @xmath19 meson that @xmath19 meson is , in general , assumed coming from the fragmentation of @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this note is to verify that the ratio in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bcfrag ] ) is consistent with @xmath3 calculated using the perturbation qcd fragmentation functions for @xmath23 @xcite and the corresponding induced gluon fragmentation functions , as well as using the leading order ( lo ) b - quark production . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also obtain the range of the parameters involved in the fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> once we obtain the parameters we can then predict the production rate for the runii at the tevatron , where much higher statistics can be accumulated .    </S>",
    "<S> the fragmentation approach employed here is different from the full tree - level @xmath24 calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comparison between these two approaches were made in some of the papers in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . basically , the fragmentation approach gives a reasonable approximation to the full tree - level calculation as long as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one disadvantage of the full calculation is that higher order effects can not be easily included unless the nlo calculation is performed . on the other hand , using the fragmentation approach some important higher order effects can be included , namely , the contribution from gluon fragmentation and the contribution from higher orbital states below the bd threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that including these contributions we can easily account for the ratio in eq . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the main source of gluon fragmentation comes from the altarelli - parisi evolution of the heavy quark fragmentation function . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this ratio increases with @xmath53 , due to the induced gluon fragmentation contribution . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath53 increases , the scale of the fragmentation function rises and , therefore , the induced gluon fragmentation function also increases . </S>",
    "<S> if we did not include the induced gluon fragmentation contribution , the ratio @xmath45 would have been a constant , giving rise to a horizontal line coincide with the lower part of the corresponding curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the gluon fragmentation probability is much smaller than the @xmath18 fragmentation , the production by gluon fragmentation turns out not negligible , because the amplitude squared of the most important subprocess @xmath55 is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of @xmath56 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ data ] ) is for @xmath21 and @xmath19 with @xmath57 gev and @xmath52 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have to convert this @xmath20 requirement on @xmath19 and @xmath21 to @xmath20 requirement on @xmath18 , because the fragmentation spectrum of @xmath18 is not monochromatic . </S>",
    "<S> the average momentum fraction @xmath58 for fragmentation of @xmath18 into @xmath19 and @xmath21 is about @xmath59 at the scale @xmath60 gev . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath20 requirement on @xmath18 becomes @xmath61 gev . from fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it appears that the ratio predicted at @xmath64 tev is about the same as at @xmath51 tev .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also demonstrate the dependence of the ratio on the factorization scale , which appears in the running @xmath68 , the parton distribution functions , and the fragmentation functions . in fig . </S>",
