    "advances in miniaturization and processing techniques of semiconductor systems have made it possible to create nanostructures containing only a small number of electrons  @xcite .",
    "these quantum dots , also called artificial atoms , provide a crucial testing ground for many important quantum effects in low - dimensional systems .",
    "the system parameters can be tuned by controlling the dot geometry , electrostatic gate voltage , and by applying a magnetic field .",
    "experimental techniques such as capacitance spectroscopy  @xcite or gated transport spectroscopy  @xcite allow experimentalists to precisely control the number of electrons in a two - dimensional parabolic confining potential , and map their electronic properties as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "such systems offer very rich quantum many - body effects , providing a link between two different branches of physics : in the limit of zero magnetic field the system acts like an atom , i.e. , it exhibits shell structure and obeys hund s first rule . on the other hand , for relatively modest magnetic fields",
    "the system exhibits incipient quantum hall physics",
    ". a large number of transitions induced by the magnetic field can be observed experimentally .",
    "the transitions can be understood from hartree - fock theory or from density functional theory ( at low magnetic fields even the simple constant interaction model  @xcite suffices ) but at high magnetic fields an accurate treatment of many - body effects is important .",
    "the aim of this work is to study in detail the transitions between many - body states for moderately large magnetic field values where the angular momentum of the system increases beyond that of the so called maximum density droplet ( mdd ) regime  @xcite , corresponding to the filling factor @xmath2 in quantum hall physics .",
    "most of the previous work on the transition between mdd to lower density states ( ldd ) was performed in the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation and/or was restricted to spin polarized electrons  @xcite .",
    "the ldd states are not always predicted to be fully spin polarized , both in the absence of landau level ( ll ) mixing  @xcite and in the presence of ll mixing  @xcite .    here , we combine exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques  @xcite to obtain a very accurate description of many - body states beyond the mdd .",
    "linear combinations of determinants obtained by exact diagonalization within the lll approximation serve as the starting point for building trial wave functions for our variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations .",
    "the method described here is very systematic , can be applied to any eigenstate , and , is more efficient than exact diagonalization with ll mixing .",
    "trial wave functions obtained by the exact diagonalization method have the right symmetry properties , including conservation of total angular momentum @xmath3 , total spin @xmath4 , and separability of center of mass and relative motion , which allows us to study center of mass excitations  @xcite .",
    "we apply our method to investigate the many - body states involved in the mdd - ldd transition .",
    "we find that for the @xmath5 electron system , the pair densities of the ground and excited states close to the mdd - ldd transition have a well defined square symmetry , while those for @xmath6 states have little structure .",
    "we find that the mdd - ldd transition acts as a convergence point for special values of @xmath7 which correspond to the magic numbers  @xcite .",
    "the redistribution of electronic charge is rather smooth in the absence of the zeeman effect , but , when a zeeman term is included in the hamiltonian it becomes more abrupt .",
    "we consider an @xmath8electron two - dimensional quantum dot with a circularly symmetric parabolic confinement potential . within the effective mass approximation , and neglecting finite thickness effects , the hamiltonian in an external magnetic field , @xmath9 , is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective mass of electron , @xmath12 is the vector potential , @xmath13 is the parameter characterizing the parabolic confinement potential , @xmath14 is the dielectric constant , @xmath15 is the effective @xmath16-factor , @xmath17 is the bohr magneton and @xmath18 is the @xmath19-component of the spin of the @xmath20 electron .",
    "we use standard materials constants corresponding to gaas , @xmath21 , dielectric constant @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "results will be given in effective atomic units ( @xmath24 ) : the effective bohr radius is @xmath25 nm , and the effective hartree is @xmath26 mev .",
    "we choose the confinement parameter @xmath27 to be 0.28 h@xmath28 or 3.32 mev , which is within the typical experimental range  @xcite .      ignoring the interaction term , the single particle fock - darwin energies of this hamiltonian are  @xcite _",

    "equivalently , the energy spectrum can be expressed as a sum of two harmonic - oscillators  @xcite , _ nm= ( n+1/2)_+ + ( m+1/2)_- , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the landau level index , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the relationship between these two sets of quantum numbers is @xmath38 or @xmath39 .    at zero",
    "@xmath9 the energies depend only on the principal quantum number , @xmath40 , whereas at infinite @xmath9 they depend only on the landau level index @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the spin index ) are used as the basis set in our exact diagonalization and qmc calculations of interacting dots . at zero magnetic field",
    "the system has degeneracies and therefore a shell structure , as in the case of real atoms . when a magnetic field is applied , the degeneracy is broken and several transitions occur due to single - electron level crossings as described by eq .",
    "[ fockdarwin ] .",
    "eventually all the electrons are in lowest landau level orbitals and each of these orbitals is doubly occupied . in a noninteracting electron picture",
    "no more transitions are predicted as the magnetic field is increased further , but , experimentally they are observed  @xcite .",
    "these can be understood from hartree - fock or density functional theory .",
    "the intra landau level splittings get smaller with increasing @xmath9 and the exchange interaction favors parallel spins , leading to spin flips , until eventually all the spins are parallel and the @xmath43 lowest angular momentum states are occupied singly .",
    "this is the maximum density droplet ( mdd ) state .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased further , hartree - fock  @xcite and density functional calculations  @xcite predict an edge reconstruction due to some electrons jumping from low angular momentum states to higher angular momentum states because the coulomb interaction overwhelms the parabolic external potential .",
    "these lower density droplet ( ldd ) states were observed experimentally@xcite but quantitative discrepancies with experiments exist . since several determinants of lll noninteracting orbitals are exactly degenerate it is expected that an accurate treatment of correlation is important .",
    "this is the range of @xmath9 that we study in this paper .",
    "the many - body wave functions may be chosen to be eigenstates of the total angular momentum @xmath44 , total spin @xmath45 and the z - component of total spin @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , the dynamic symmetry of an isotropic parabolic potential leads to the separability of center of mass and relative motion and the existence of two _ center of mass operators _",
    "@xcite , @xmath47 and @xmath48 that commute with the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the above operators : @xmath51 determinants of fock - darwin orbitals are eigenfunctions of @xmath50 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the many - body hamiltonian in a determinantal basis is block diagonal , with the blocks corresponding to different @xmath52 values .",
    "also , we note that lll determinants are eigenfunctions of @xmath47 with eigenvalues @xmath53 .",
    "the size of the subspaces can be further reduced by employing linear combinations of determinants , known as configuration state functions ( csfs ) , that are eigenstates of @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath45 and @xmath48 is done as explained in ref .",
    "the matrix elements of the coulomb interaction can be determined either by numerical integration or analytically  @xcite .",
    "for a state with a given total angular momentum @xmath3 , and for a given number of landau levels , @xmath35 , only single - particle states with angular momentum @xmath54 contribute , where @xmath55 .",
    "for fully spin polarized lll wave functions , @xmath56 and for lower spin states it is higher than that . as the number of landau levels is increased , @xmath57 increases , both because the remaining @xmath58 electrons can lower their angular momenta by occupying more than one landau level and because the @xmath59 landau level has states with @xmath60 . empirically we find that determinants containing orbitals with @xmath61 contribute little to the wave function and consequently we could limit ourselves to orbitals with @xmath62 .",
    "however , in most cases we avoid doing this because the wave functions are no longer exact eigenstates of the operator @xmath48 .      in this work",
    ", we use both the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods  @xcite to improve the exact diagonalization wave functions and energies obtained within the lll .",
    "first , we introduce variational parameters by multiplying the lll wave function by a jastrow factor and optimize the jastrow parameters by minimizing the variance of the local energy  @xcite . for a given state @xmath63 ,",
    "the form of our trial wave functions is @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the electron - electron , electron - dot , and electron - electron - dot jastrow terms respectively .",
    "the csf s @xmath66 are obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath45 and @xmath48 matrices .",
    "multiplying by the jastrow factor does not alter the @xmath3 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 symmetries of the wave function , aside from introducing a completely negligible amount of spin contamination  @xcite ( not an exact eigenstate of @xmath69 ) , arising from the different cusp conditions for parallel- and antiparallel - spin electrons .",
    "the jastrow factor reduces the statistical error in both vmc and dmc for a given number of monte carlo steps .",
    "it also lowers the vmc energy , but leave the fixed - phase dmc energy ( described later ) unchanged because the phase of the trial wave function is not altered .",
    "the linear coefficients @xmath70 are obtained by diagonalizing @xmath49 .",
    "they can also serve as additional free parameters that can be reoptimized in vmc .",
    "however , we have found that , at sufficiently large magnetic fields , there is no gain in energy from reoptimizing them , and the exact lll wave function multiplied by the optimized jastrow factor provides an excellent trial wave function .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in the absence of a magnetic field , where the reoptimized linear coefficients in the presence of the jastrow factor are considerably smaller in magnitude than the original ones from exact diagonalization .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "quantum chemists distinguish between static correlation ( also known as near - degeneracy correlation ) and dynamic correlation . within the quantum monte carlo literature",
    "it is well understood that static correlation is most effectively incorporated into the wave function by using a linear combination of nearly degenerate determinants , whereas dynamic correlation is most efficiently treated by a flexible jastrow factor . in the case of dots in sufficiently large magnetic fields",
    "the separation of energy scales ( intra landau level versus inter landau level ) is very large and the distinction between static and dynamic correlation becomes sharp .    for any given state , the determinantal coefficients @xmath70 , for a lll wave function , need not be recalculated when the system parameters @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 are varied , because the @xmath70 are independent of these system parameters .",
    "this is because all the lll determinants with a given @xmath3 have the same expectation value for the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "so the single - particle terms in the hamiltonian contribute a multiple of the unit matrix and only the interaction part of the hamiltonian need be diagonalized .",
    "hence , the lll wave function is independent of @xmath14 , and , depends on @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 only through a scaling of the linear dimensions by the factor @xmath71 .",
    "consequently these jastrow - lll wave functions are not only a very accurate choice but also a very efficient choice for qmc calculations . of course",
    "this does not apply to low angular momentum @xmath3 states because it is impossible to construct them using only lll orbitals .",
    "note also that the independence of the @xmath70 on the system parameters makes the fock - darwin orbitals the most efficient choice , as opposed to using say hartree fock or density functional orbitals .",
    "the dmc method improves upon the vmc energy by projecting onto the lowest energy wave function that has the same nodes ( or the same phase in the case of complex wave functions ) as the trial wave function .",
    "the resulting fixed - node or fixed - phase energies are upper bounds to the true energies and consequently the accuracy of the calculations depends on the quality of the nodes or the phase of the trial wave functions .",
    "we employ an efficient implementation of dmc described in ref .  .",
    "since we use complex trial wave functions , we employ the fixed phase approximation  @xcite , which has previously been applied to quantum dot systems  @xcite : starting from a variational wave function @xmath72 , a new function @xmath73 is introduced , where @xmath74 is the ground state of the @xmath43-body hamiltonian subject to the constraint that it have the same phase as @xmath75 .",
    "the integral form of the schrdinger equation in imaginary time ( @xmath76 ) then can be written in terms of @xmath77 as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the coordinates of n electrons , @xmath80 , is a green function that is explicitly known only in the short - time limit ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "hence , the eq .",
    "(  [ mastereq ] ) can be solved by applying @xmath82 repeadetly until the desired projection is obtained .",
    "since the function @xmath77 is used as a probability density for monte carlo sampling , it must be real and positive which is equivalent to the assumption that the phase of @xmath74 is the same as that of the trial wave function @xmath72 .",
    "after equilibration , the energy can be calculated as an average over the sampled points @xmath83 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the real part of the local energy , @xmath86    we note , however , that for an external potential with circular symmetry it is also possible to use the fixed node approximation : in the subspace of the good quantum number @xmath3 , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath87 which is purely real .",
    "we can ignore the last term in @xmath49 since it just gives a trivial shift in the energies of the various @xmath3 states .",
    "for the remaining part of @xmath49 , states with angular momentum @xmath3 and @xmath88 are degenerate and so we can consider their sum , which is real .",
    "it is possible to expand these real lll wave functions in terms of real orbitals , but the number of determinants increases greatly .",
    "for instance , a mdd state can be written as a single determinant of complex orbitals or a sum of @xmath89 determinants of real orbitals .",
    "so , it is more efficient to use complex wave functions within the fixed phase approximation .",
    "we now apply the techniques described above to quantum dots similar to those studied experimentally  @xcite , in magnetic fields ranging from @xmath90 tesla bringing the dots in the vicinity of mdd - ldd transition .",
    "since the zeeman term just results in a trivial shift of the different @xmath68 states relative to each other , we will ignore the zeeman term unless explicitly stated otherwise .      in this subsection",

    "[ e_n6 ] , the @xmath136 state occurs only if a zeeman term is included . as a result of the zeeman splitting ,",
    "the charge redistribution during the mdd - ldd transition becomes more abrupt , as in the @xmath5 dot .",
    "to summarize , by combining exact diagonalization and qmc methods , we have obtained highly accurate many - body wave functions and energies for circular parabolic dots in the range of magnetic fields corresponding to the mdd - ldd transition . in this regime",
    ", the dot goes through several angular momentum and spin transitions , and one does not expect hartree - fock theory , or , density functional theory with an approximate functional , to provide an accurate description .",
    "exact diagonalization is prohibitively expensive because of the importance of landau level mixing .",
    "exact diagonalization wave functions within the lll approximation are not sufficiently accurate on their own , but when they are multiplied by an optimized jastrow and used as trial wave functions in dmc , they lead to very accurate energies .",
    "the high accuracy of the fixed phase dmc energies shows that the phase of exact wave functions is not strongly affected by ll mixing .",
    "the method described is very efficient since the trial wave functions have determinantal coefficients that are independent of system parameters @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 , and the jastrow optimization process is very fast and stable .",
    "we have found that near the mdd - ldd transition , the pair densities for @xmath5 have a well defined square structure , whereas those for @xmath6 have little structure . when the zeeman energy is included ,",
    "the next ground state beyond the mdd state is fully polarized and has @xmath120 .",
    "this leads to an abrupt redistribution of charge , as observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "if instead the zeeman energy is zero then several unpolarized and partially polarized states become ground states over a rather small range of magnetic fields and the charge redistribution is smaller and smoother .",
    "this could be verified experimentally .",
    "for instance , if a material for which the @xmath142factor can be tuned to a small value is used , then the transition from unpolarized or partially polarized ldd states to fully polarized ones could be induced by increasing the effective @xmath142factor by using tilted magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the number of electrons that can be studied with this method is limited by the number of slater determinants in the lll approximation .",
    "this increases rapidly as the angular momentum increases beyond the mdd value , @xmath143 .",
    "if the system is fully spin polarized , the number of determinants in the lll approximation is much reduced and @xmath43 can be much larger . when @xmath3 is sufficiently large that the number of determinants in even the lll becomes too large it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of determinants by employing composite fermion wave functions  @xcite , which are very good approximations to the exact lll wave functions .",
    "once again landau level mixing can be incorporated very efficiently with qmc .",
    "this has been done for a 15-electron dot in ref .  .",
    "we thank w. geist , j. jain , m. korkusinski and f. pederiva for helpful discussions . this work was supported by the nsf and fcar ."
