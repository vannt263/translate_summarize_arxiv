    "many modifications of theories of gravity are motivated by one of the outstanding puzzles of modern cosmology : the origin of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the most common approach to this issue relies on the presence of a dominating dark energy component ( with @xmath0 ) @xcite , which might arise from several competing candidates : a cosmological constant term in the einstein - hilbert action , a scalar field , usually referred to as quintessence @xcite , chameleon fields @xcite , or other alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) , such as the cardassian model with a modification of the friedmann equation @xcite , braneworld scenarios @xcite or the generalized chaplygin gas unification of dark energy and dark matter @xcite .",
    "aiming at a description of this dark energy component , several authors have put forward proposals based upon the so - called @xmath1 models , where a modified action functional exhibiting a non - linear function of the scalar curvature @xmath2 is considered @xcite .",
    "this is usually regarded as stemming from a low - energy phenomenological approximation to some higher energy fundamental theory ; indeed , one - loop renormalization of gr requires the introduction of higher order terms in the curvature in the einstein - hilbert action functional , and other available invariants  such as contractions of the ricci or of the riemann tensor  may also arise when quantum corrections arising from string theory are considered ( see ref .",

    ", these models usually rely on a decreasing @xmath1 function that , since the scalar curvature is decreasing , deviates strongly from gr at late times  thus producing the required accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "aiming to further extend the @xmath1 theories , a model was advanced exhibiting not only a non - linear @xmath1 term in the action functional , but also a non - minimal coupling between the matter lagrangian density @xmath3 and the scalar curvature @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that this latter model may be used to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe without any explicit additional matter component ( _ e.g. _ scalar fields ) . by resorting to a previous study where it was shown that this non - minimal gravitational coupling with matter can mimic known dark matter profiles ( thus producing the reported flattening galaxy rotation curves ) @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that the proposed model yields , through its gravitational impact , a viable unified scheme to mimic the presence of both dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this work is organized as follows : the non - minimal gravitational coupling model is discussed in section ii ; an analytical work , establishing quantitative results related to the accelerated expansion of the universe , is discussed in section iii ; this discussion sets up the numerical calculation that confirms the proposed scenario in section iv .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "following the discussion of the previous section , one postulates the following action for the theory @xcite :    s = d^4 x [ action ]  ,    where @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) are arbitrary functions of the scalar curvature @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the lagrangian density of matter and @xmath6 is the metric determinant .",

    "it is trivial to argue that this regime can not occur forever : the de sitter phase is characterized by a constant scalar curvature _ vis - a - vis _ a constant @xmath191 ; however , the matter density @xmath36 decreases monotonically , so that @xmath58 also drops .",
    "hence , even if the condition @xmath60 is verified at the onset of the exponential expansion phase , it will eventually be untenable .",
    "one must also check either the friedmann or the raychaudhuri equation ( [ raychaudhuri ] ) , for consistency . from , one has    _ c + 3 p_c = - f_2 ( f_2 - 12 h_0 ^ 2 f_2 ) ( 12 h_0 ^ 2 - f_2 f_2 )  ,    considering the previous condition @xmath60 for the @xmath61 regime .",
    "hence , the raychaudhuri equation becomes    [ difeq ] 1 + f_2 = 24 f_2 h_0 ^ 2  ,    which admits the solution    [ dssol1 ] 1 + f_2(r ) = k ( r r_2 )  ,    defining @xmath192 and with @xmath193 an integration constant .",
    "this is clearly a unphysical result , since @xmath193 must be positive ( so to match the einstein - hilbert action when @xmath194 ) , one obtains an increasing function @xmath19 of the scalar curvature .",
    "this becomes less and less relevant as @xmath2 decreases during the matter dominated phase , and the transition to the de sitter phase never occurs  on the contrary , the non - minimal coupling dominates at an early epoch .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "one entertains the following possibility : is it feasible to `` push the envelope '' in order to obtain a different form for @xmath19 , by reinterpreting ?",
    "one may assume that the simple de sitter phase is not actually enforced in nature , and the scalar curvature will not be constant : one could perhaps replace the factor @xmath195 , thus recasting as    1+f_2 = 2r f_2  .",
    "however , this also yields an increasing solution @xmath196 , with @xmath197 a free parameter .",
    "again , one must select the positive , increasing solution , with the same unphysical result .",
    "clearly , no amount of creativity can go against the simple interpretation of : since @xmath198 must be positive , so should @xmath199 .",
    "hence , no form for the non - minimal gravitational coupling @xmath19 yields a de sitter phase .    in order to close this session",
    ", one may resort to a simple argument that corroborates this impossibility : the simplest model that originates a de sitter phase relies on the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "hence , one may naively expect that the non - minimal gravitational coupling term should behave as a constant , @xmath200 .",
    "recycling a previous point , one remarks that the constant scalar curvature yields a constant term @xmath19 , so that this mimicking of the cosmological constant would demand a non - evolving lagrangian density @xmath3 !",
    "neither the adopted choice @xmath201 or any of the classically equivalent `` on - shell '' forms ( _ i.e. _ @xmath202 @xcite ) remain constant , since the relevant thermodynamic quantities decrease as the universe expands .",
    "in this work , one has applied a model exhibiting a non - minimal gravitational coupling with matter to the fundamental issue of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . in order to do so",
    ", one first assumes a constant deceleration parameter @xmath203 : the related power - law form @xmath204 of the scale factor leads one to consider a power - law non - minimal coupling @xmath205 , so that a negative exponent is required to drive the transition away from the early matter dominated phase .    in the analytical study ,",
    "one first derived the equivalent form for the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations ; since an exact solution does not exist , the two competing regimes @xmath190 or @xmath70 were discussed , and it was found that the later dominates throughout the evolution of the universe .",
    "the identification @xmath206 was thus obtained , as well as the dependence of the deceleration parameter @xmath207 $ ] and the related eos parameter @xmath208 .",
    "the obtained scenario was numerically tested through the variation of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "the available evolution profiles for the deceleration parameter @xmath140 and the eos parameter @xmath209 were compared with the obtained solutions , and it was found that a thorough fit of these results is not fully compatible with the current values for the hubble parameter and the matter density .    however , the driving force behind the present effort is not to yield a complete match with observations , but to thoroughly explore the proposed mechanism leading to an asymptotic accelerated expansion universe . for this reason ,",
    "the simplifying assumptions of a linear form for the pure curvature term @xmath210 was made , trading the perceived loss of flexibility that a combined analysis of non - trivial @xmath18 and @xmath19 might yield with the advantage of deriving analytical results .    with this in mind , the present work should be regarded as a first step towards a more complete description based on the encompassing concept of modifying the einstein - hilbert action , and in a similar way to what was performed regarding the flattening of the galaxy rotation curves , a future improvement would include the effect of a combination of power - laws for @xmath19 .",
    "more ambitiously , one could attempt to reverse - engineer the exercise and read the form for @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the observed evolution profiles , using the latter as inputs , instead of targets .    despite the above justification",
    ", one could consider that the results that were used for comparison ( based on ref .",
    "@xcite ) employ a fitting function that might be proven inadequate . indeed , the main qualitatively difference between these scenarios and the solutions obtained in this work is that the latter present a much smoother transition from the matter dominated to the accelerated expansion phase : speculatively , one can state that perhaps the relatively small number of well selected supernovae observations close to the recognized transition redshift @xmath211 might allow for a shallower @xmath140 transition .",
    "a final remark is in order : earlier in the text , it was suggested that the versatility of the proposed model naturally accounts for the effects of the presence of the two `` dark '' components of the universe : dark energy and dark matter . indeed , the possibility that different terms present in the non - minimal coupling @xmath19 manifest themselves at distinct scales , astrophysical or cosmological in nature , does not require that the same exponent @xmath50 and characteristic scale @xmath212 is shared between widely differing phenomena .    in the present case",
    ", it was shown that the @xmath133 or @xmath213 exponents , which have been shown to account for the observed flattening of the galaxy rotation curves , do not have cosmological relevance  allowing for other values for @xmath50 to assume such role .",
    "notwithstanding , it is interesting to notice that the same eos form arises both for dark matter as well as for dark energy , given by the parameter @xmath208 .",
    "this unification is also illustrated by the formulation of the proposed model as a multi - scalar - tensor theory @xcite : in this context , an interesting target for future research lies in the possibility of bridging the mechanism here described with others encountered in the literature , namely quintessence models @xcite , chameleon fields @xcite or , the aforementioned generalized chaplygin gas unified model @xcite .",
