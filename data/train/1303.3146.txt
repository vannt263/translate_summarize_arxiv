    "as is well known , in models of slow - roll inflation with one scalar field the curvature perturbation originates from the vacuum fluctuations during inflationary expansion , and these fluctuations lead to practically gaussian classical curvature perturbations with an almost flat power spectrum .",
    "however , it is well known also that both these features are not generic in the case of inflationary models with two ( or more ) scalar fields : such models can easily predict adiabatic perturbations with , e.g. , a `` blue '' spectrum and these perturbations can be non - gaussian @xcite .    possibilities for appearing of non - gaussian fluctuations in inflationary models with multiple scalar fields had been discussed long ago @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales ( which is allowed in multiple - field scenarios @xcite ) implies that , in principle , a rather large non - gaussian signal can be generated during inflation . according to the observational data @xcite , the primordial curvature perturbation is gaussian with an almost scale - independent power spectrum .",
    "so far there is only a weak indication of possible primordial non - gaussianity [ at @xmath1 level ] from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature information data ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "however , non - gaussianity is expected to become an important probe of both the early and the late universe in the coming years @xcite .",
    "the second important feature of predictions of two - field models is that these models can lead to primordial curvature perturbations with blue spectrum ( for scales which are smaller than cosmological ones ) and , correspondingly , can predict the primordial black hole ( pbh ) production at some time after inflation . in this case ,",
    "pbhs become a probe for the non - gaussianity of cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "the results of pbh searches can be used to constrain the ranges of early universe model parameters .",
    "there are several types of two - field inflation scenarios in which detectable non - gaussianity of the curvature perturbation can be generated : curvaton models @xcite , models with a non - inflaton field causing inhomogeneous reheating @xcite , curvaton - type models of preheating ( see , e.g. , ref . and references therein ) , models of waterfall transition that ends the hybrid inflation @xcite . in these two - field models the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 has two components : a contribution of the inflaton ( almost gaussian ) and a contribution of the extra field .",
    "this second component is parameterized by the following way @xcite @xmath3 if @xmath4 , one has a @xmath5-model .",
    "obviously , the quadratic term ca nt dominate in @xmath2 on cosmological scales where cmb data are available .",
    "it can , however , be important on smaller scales .    in the present work we study the predictions of the pbh production and corresponding pbh constraints for the curvaton model .",
    "the potentially large non - gaussianity in this model is connected with the fact that the predicted magnitude of the curvature perturbation is proportional to a square of the non - inflaton ( curvaton ) field .",
    "the blue spectrum in the curvaton model is due to , e.g. , supergravity effects leading to the large effective mass of the curvaton @xcite .",
    "the main attention in the present paper is paid to a study of probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the curvature perturbation and the shape of the black hole mass function , with taking into account of the non - gaussianity .",
    "the first general study of pdf of the curvature perturbation in curvaton model was carried out in ref . .",
    "pbh production in curvaton scenario was studied in recent works , ( without considering the non - gaussian effects ) .",
    "the approximate pbh constraints on the curvature perturbation power spectrum in the curvaton model were obtained in ref . .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we study the process of pbh production in the case when the primordial curvature perturbations are strongly non - gaussian .",
    "we calculate the pdf function for the @xmath5-model and use it for a calculation of pbh mass spectrum via press - schechter mechanism . in sec .",
    "[ sec - curvaton ] we discuss the possible production of pbhs in the curvaton model and the corresponding cosmological constraints that can be obtained .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec - concl ] .",
    "generally , in @xmath5-model the connection between curvature perturbation @xmath2 and the square of the ( non - inflaton ) scalar field perturbation value @xmath5 is @xmath6 the distribution of @xmath7 is assumed to be gaussian , i.e. , @xmath8 the form of the pdf depends on the sign in front of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ zetapm ] ) .",
    "if the sign is negative , i.e. , @xmath9 it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath10 and the pdf is given by the formula @xcite @xmath11 which is just a @xmath5-distribution with one degree of freedom , with an opposite sign of the argument , shifted to a value of @xmath12 .    in a case of the positive sign in eq .",
    "( [ zetapm ] ) one has , correspondingly , @xmath13 and , introducing the notation @xmath14 one obtains for the pdf the expression @xmath15 the case when the sign is negative is realized in the model of hybrid inflation waterfall @xcite and was studied in detail in ref . .",
    "in this case , @xmath7 is the perturbation of the waterfall field .    in our present case , when @xmath7 is the perturbation of the curvaton field , the sign is positive .",
    "the variance of the pdf of the @xmath2 field distribution is @xmath16 this variance is connected with the curvature perturbation spectrum @xmath17 through the expression @xmath18    the distribution function ( [ pzeta - curvaton ] ) can be written in the form @xmath19 here , the ratio @xmath20 is introduced .",
    "the first central moments of the pdf of the @xmath2 field are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a variance of the @xmath7-field power spectrum , @xmath23 we will use also the central moments of @xmath24 distribution ( `` reduced central moments '' ) .",
    "they are given by the expression @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , for the skewness and kurtosis one has , respectively , @xmath26    for the following , we need the expression for the pdf of the smoothed curvature fluctuations , i.e. , instead of eq .",

    "in particular , seto @xcite showed that , if the spectrum @xmath39 has a power form , @xmath40 , the scale dependences of the variance and third central moment of the @xmath41 field are : @xmath42 correspondingly , the scale dependence is canceled in the expression for the skewness parameter , @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , it appears @xcite ( and it is most essential for our case ) that , if @xmath44 , the value of @xmath45 is quantitatively close to @xmath46 [ which is equal to @xmath47 , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ cms ] ) ] .",
    "the analogous check had been performed in ref . for the next central moment ( kurtosis ) .",
    "it follows from this analysis that the shape of @xmath48 distribution is close to the shape of @xmath49 distribution , and the smoothing effects enter only through the value of the variance , @xmath50 .",
    "as we will see in the next section , in our case the spectrum of the @xmath7-field has a power form , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is of order of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , basing on the above cited works , we will use eq .",

    "it follows from this figure that the value of @xmath59 is already enough for producing an observable amount of pbhs in this model ( this is in agreement with the estimates of refs . , ) .      for a derivation of pbh mass spectrum and pbh constraints we will use the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
