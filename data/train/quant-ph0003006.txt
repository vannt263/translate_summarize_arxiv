    "quantum computers have been the subject of much study , mainly because of computations that can be done more efficiently than on classical computers .",
    "well known examples include shor s and grover s algorithms , @xcite .",
    "quantum robots have also been recently described as mobile systems , with an on board quantum computer and ancillary systems , that move in and interact with environments of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "dynamics of quantum robots are described as tasks consisting of alternating computation and action phases .",
    "quantum robots can be used to carry out many types of tasks .",
    "these range from simple ones such as searching a region of space to determine the unknown location of a system to complex tasks such as carrying out physical experiments .",
    "the fact that the spatial searches are similar to the data base searches which are efficiently implemented using grover s algorithm @xcite suggests that similar results might hold for use of grover s algorithm to process results of a quantum search of a spatial region .",
    "this is an example of the possible applicability of grover s algorithm to various physical measurements @xcite .",
    "if this can be done for the search task , then one would have an example of a task that can be carried out more efficiently by a quantum robot than by any classical robot .",
    "this possibility is analyzed here for a search of a 2 dimensional space region by a quantum robot to locate a system .",
    "it is seen that for reversible searches with time independent unitary dynamics , there are two problems preventing the efficient use of grover s algorithm .",
    "one is that it appears impossible to remove entanglements generated during the search process .",
    "the other problem is that the action in the search task , which is the equivalent of the `` oracle function '' , which is assumed in grover s algorithm to be evaluated on any argument in one step , takes many steps to evaluate .",
    "the result is that even if the entanglement problem is ignored , quantum searches of 2 dimensional space regions are no more efficient than classical searches",
    ". however quantum searches of higher dimensional space regions are more efficient than classical searches .",
    "the plan of this paper is to give , in the next section , a brief description of quantum robots and a summary of how they are different from quantum computers .",
    "this is followed , in section [ qr ] , by a description of the dynamics of tasks as sequences of alternating computation and action phases .",
    "an explicit description of the dynamics is given as a feynman sum over computation - action phase paths .",
    "an example of a quantum robot searching a space area to determine the unknown location of a systems is then described , section [ exqs ] .",
    "the next section is concerned with the use of grover s algorithm to process the search results .",
    "a very brief summary of grover s algorithm , in subsection [ ga ] , is followed by a description of the problems encountered , subsection [ puga ] .",
    "the paper finishes with a discussion of why quantum robots are interesting independent of these results .",
    "quantum robots are similar to quantum computers in that an important component is an on board quantum computer .",
    "other systems such as a memory system @xmath0 , an output system @xmath1 , and a control qubit @xmath2 are also present in quantum robots @xcite .",
    "a relatively minor difference is that quantum robots are mobile whereas quantum computers are stationary relative to the environment . for quantum turing machine models of quantum computers",
    "the head moves but the quantum registers are stationary . for networks of quantum gates",
    "the qubit systems move but the gates are stationary .",
    "this is shown in physical models of interacting qubits .",
    "examples include ion trap models @xcite or nuclear magnetic resonance models @xcite . in these cases the ion traps and the liquid of active molecules are stationary .",
    "as is the case for quantum computers the effects of the environment on the component systems of the quantum robot need to be minimized .",
    "methods to achieve this include the possible use of shielding or quantum error correction codes @xcite .",
    "however other than this the dynamical properties of the environment are completely arbitrary .",
    "this is quite different than the case for quantum computers . to see this assume for quantum turing machines that the quantum registers are the environment of the head .",
    "similarly for gate networks the moving qubits may be considered as the environment of the network of quantum gates . here",
    "the dynamics of these systems is quite restricted in that the states of the registers or moving qubits can change only during interaction with the head or the gate systems .",
    "also the types of changes that can occur are limited to those appropriate for the specific computation being carried out .",
    "this shows the main difference between quantum robots and quantum computers , namely , that for quantum computers the states of the qubits must not change spontaneously in the absence of interactions related to the computation .",
    "no such dynamical restrictions apply to the environment of quantum robots .",
    "the states of environmental systems may change spontaneously whether the quantum robot is or is not interacting with them .",
    "another aspect relates to the requirement that the quantum robot can not be a multistate system with one or a very few number of degrees of freedom , but must include a quantum computer .",
    "one reason is the need for computations as part of the implementation of any task ( see below ) .",
    "another is that the quantum robot may need to be able to respond to a large number of different environmental states .",
    "also a large repertoire of different ( task dependent ) responses to the same environmental state must be available .",
    "if the total number @xmath3 of needed responses is large then the only physically reasonable approach is to make the number of degrees of freedom of the quantum robot proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "this is satisfied by including a quantum computer on board .",
    "the dynamics of quantum robots are described as tasks consisting of alternating computation and action phases @xcite .",
    "the purpose of each computation phase is to determine what is to be done in the next action phase .",
    "the computation may depend on the states of @xmath5 , and the local environment as input .",
    "the goal is to put @xmath1 in one of a set @xmath6 of basis states each of which specifies an action . during the computation the quantum robot does not move .",
    "interactions with the environment , if any , are limited to local entanglement interactions of the type occurring in the measurement process ( premeasurements in the sense of peres @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of an action phase is to carry out the action determined by the previous computation phase .",
    "the action is determined by the state of @xmath1 and may include local premeasurements of the environment state .",
    "activities during this phase include motion of the quantum robot and local changes in the state of the environment .",
    "the action is independent of the state of the on board quantum computer and the @xmath0 system .",
    "if @xmath1 is in a state in @xmath6 , then the state does not change during the action .",
    "the purpose of the control qubit @xmath2 is to regulate which type of phase is active .",
    "the computation [ action ] phase is active only if @xmath2 is in state @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "thus the last step of the computation [ action ] phase is the change @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the overall system evolution is described here using a discrete space time lattice . in this case",
    "a unitary elementary step operator @xmath9 gives the overall system evolution during an elementary time step @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath9 has , in general , nonzero matrix elements between environmental degrees of freedom and quantum robot degrees of freedom , it describes the evolution of the environment and the quantum robot as well as interactions between the environment and the quantum robot .",
    "it is useful to decompose @xmath9 into two terms based on the states of the control qubit .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are projection operators on the respective control qubit states @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are step operators for the action and computation phases .",
    "interactions among environmental degrees of freedom as well as degrees of freedom of the quantum robot other than those taking part in the task dynamics , if any , are also included in both operators .    some of the conditions described for the computation and action phases",
    "are reflected in properties that the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 must satisfy . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath18 are projection operators for finding the quantum robot at each lattice position @xmath19 ( @xmath20 in d - dimensional space ) and the output system in any state @xmath21 in @xmath6 , then one has @xmath22    these commutation relations express the requirements that the position of the quantum robot does not change during the computation phase and , except for possible entanglements with environmental states , the state of the output system is not changed during the action phase .",
    "these entanglements would occur if @xmath1 was in a linear superposition of @xmath6 states each of which resulted in different environment states during the action .",
    "another property of @xmath16 is that it is the identity operator on the space of states for the on board quantum computer and memory system degrees of freedom .",
    "note also that @xmath16 and @xmath17 do not commute .",
    "if @xmath23 is the overall system state at time @xmath24 then the state at time @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the amplitude for finding the quantum robot and environment in a state @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 here @xmath29 denote the states of all environmental and quantum robot systems except the control qubit in some suitable basis , and @xmath30 refer to the states of @xmath2 .",
    "all the information about the dynamics of the system is given in the matrix elements @xmath31 .",
    "for each @xmath32 the matrix element can be expanded in a feynman sum over phase paths @xcite .",
    "one first expands @xmath33 as a sum of products of @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath34    in this expansion the number of phases is given by the value of @xmath35 which ranges from @xmath36 corresponding to one phase with @xmath37 steps to @xmath38 corresponding to n alternating phases each of @xmath39 step .",
    "the duration of the @xmath40 phase is given by the value of @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the requirement that the total number of steps equals @xmath37 , or @xmath43 , is indicated by the upper limit @xmath44 on the @xmath45 sum .",
    "the alternation of phases is shown by @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( or @xmath2 ) if @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath50 expresses the fact that the @xmath35th phase may not be completed .    expansion in a complete set of states between each of the phase operators @xmath51 gives the desired path sum : @xmath52 here the sum is over all paths @xmath53 of states of length @xmath54 with beginning and endpoints given by the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "that is @xmath57 .",
    "the states of the control qubit have been suppressed as they correspond to the values of @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath58 .",
    "each term in this large sum gives the amplitude for finding @xmath35 alternating phases in the first @xmath37 steps where the @xmath40 phase begins with all systems ( except for c ) in state @xmath59 and ends after @xmath41 steps in state @xmath60 .",
    "the sums express the dispersion in the duration or number of steps in each phase ( @xmath45 sums ) , in the number of phases ( @xmath35 sum ) , and in the initial and terminal states for each phase ( @xmath53 sums ) .",
    "quantum robots are well suited for carrying out search tasks . as",
    "a simple example consider a search task where a quantum robot searches a large square area @xmath61 of @xmath62 sites to locate a system @xmath63 . to keep things simple @xmath63",
    "is assumed to be motionless and located at just one unknown site .",
    "the goal of the search is to determine the location of @xmath63 in @xmath61 .",
    "the quantum robot consists of an on board quantum computer , memory and output systems , and a control qubit .",
    "the on board computer is assumed here to be a quantum turing machine consisting of a head moving on a cyclic lattice of @xmath64 qubits .",
    "@xmath65 denotes of the order of .",
    "the memory system also is a cyclic lattice which is taken here to have about the same number of qubits and to lie adjacent to the computation lattice .",
    "a schematic representation of the quantum robot located at a corner ( the origin ) of @xmath61 is shown in the figure .",
    "one method of carrying out the search is to let the coordinates @xmath66 with @xmath67 of each point of @xmath61 define a search path .",
    "if the memory is initially in state @xmath68 the quantum robot , starting from the location @xmath69 moves @xmath70 sites in the @xmath19 direction , then @xmath71 sites in the @xmath72 direction and looks for @xmath63 at its location . after recording the presence or absence of @xmath63 at the site and further processing ,",
    "if any , the quantum robot returns along the path to the origin .",
    "a more detailed description starts with the qubits in the memory , @xmath0 , and computation lattice , @xmath73 , in the state @xmath74 the output system @xmath1 in state @xmath75 and a computation phase active ( @xmath2 in state @xmath76 ) .",
    "after copying the m state onto @xmath77 to give the state @xmath78 , the computation phase checks to see if @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath80 the computation phase continues by subtracting @xmath39 from @xmath81 to give @xmath82 .",
    "it ends by changing the @xmath1 state to @xmath83 and the @xmath2 state to @xmath84 .",
    "the action phase consists of one step ( one iteration of @xmath16 ) in which the quantum robot moves one lattice site in the @xmath85 direction and the @xmath2 state is converted back to @xmath76 .",
    "the process is repeated until the state with @xmath79 is reached on @xmath73 .",
    "then the above process is repeated for @xmath71 ( the @xmath1 state now becomes @xmath86 to denote one step motion in the @xmath87 direction ) until @xmath88 is reached in the state of @xmath73 .    at this point the presence or absence of @xmath63 at the location @xmath66 of the quantum robot is recorded during a computation phase and , after further processing , if any , the quantum robot returns along the same path .",
    "this is done by interleaving motion of the quantum robot in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 directions , with corresponding @xmath1 states @xmath91 , with adding @xmath39 to the @xmath72 , and then @xmath19 components of the @xmath73 state with checking if the values @xmath71 and then @xmath70 are reached .",
    "this is done by stepwise comparison with the state of @xmath0 which remains unchanged .",
    "when the state of @xmath73 is the same as the state of @xmath0 the quantum robot has returned to the starting point at the origin of @xmath61 .",
    "a computation phase changes the @xmath1 state to @xmath75 and transfers motion to some ballast system .",
    "as has been noted this is necessary to preserve reversibility and the corresponding unitarity of the dynamics @xcite",
    ".    examples of ballast motion consist of repetitions of adding @xmath39 to a large lattice of @xmath92 qubits or emitting a particle which moves away from @xmath61 . in the first case with a finite number @xmath93 of ballast states ,",
    "the quantum robot remains in the final state of the search degrees of freedom for a finite time only before the search process is undone .",
    "this does not occur for the second case with an infinite number of ballast states .",
    "before applying grover s algorithm to process the results of the search , it is useful to understand what it does and how it works .",
    "a very brief summary , that follows grover @xcite and chen et al @xcite , is given next .",
    "suppose one has a data base @xmath94 of @xmath3 elements and a function @xmath95 that takes the value @xmath24 on all elements except one , @xmath96 , on which @xmath95 has value @xmath39 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath96 is completely unknown and that a procedure is available for obtaining the value of @xmath95 on any element of the data base in 1 step .",
    "let each @xmath19 in @xmath94 correspond to a unique length @xmath37 binary string and @xmath97 be the corresponding n - qubit state .",
    "let the initial state for the search be given by @xmath98 where the sum is over all @xmath3 elements @xmath19 in @xmath94 .",
    "this corresponds to a coherent sum over all product @xmath99 states of @xmath37 qubits in a quantum computer if @xmath100 .",
    "this state is easily constructed from the constant @xmath24 state @xmath101 by applying the operator @xmath102 to each qubit . here",
    "@xmath103 are the pauli matrices .",
    "this is referred to as the walsh - hadamard transformation @xmath104 .",
    "thus @xmath105 .",
    "define the unitary operator @xmath106 by @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 . both @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "are projection operators on the states @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the coherent sum over all states @xmath115 with @xmath19 in @xmath94 and different from @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath116 and @xmath117 are orthonormal they form a binary basis for a 2 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "one can expand @xmath112 in this basis : @xmath118 in the same basis @xmath106 has the representation @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this shows that @xmath106 acting on @xmath112 corresponds to a rotation by @xmath122 , and @xmath0 iterations of @xmath106 correspond to a rotation by @xmath123 .",
    "so , carrying out @xmath0 iterations of @xmath106 on @xmath112 where @xmath124 , rotates @xmath112 from a state that is almost orthogonal to @xmath117 to a state that is almost parallel to @xmath117 .",
    "measurement of this final state gives with high probability , the value of @xmath96 .",
    "grover s algorithm derives its efficiency from the fact that this rotation is achieved with @xmath125 whereas classically @xmath126 steps are needed to find @xmath96 with high probability .",
    "the iteration of @xmath106 must be stopped at the right value of @xmath0 because additional iterations will continue to rotate @xmath112 .",
    "efficient implementation of this algorithm on a quantum computer , corresponds to iteration of @xmath106 on each component of @xmath112 .",
    "this requires that it is possible to determine , in a small number of steps , if @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
    "this is often described in terms of an unknown or `` oracle '' function @xmath95 on @xmath94 , where @xmath129 $ ] if @xmath130 $ ] , that can be evaluated in one step on any @xmath19 in @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath131 is implementable in @xmath132 steps as @xmath105 and @xmath104 is the product of @xmath37 single qubit operators .",
    "grover @xcite first introduced the algorithm for searching an unstructured data base of @xmath100 elements for a single element ( f has value 1 on just one element ) . since then the algorithm has been much studied under various generalizations .",
    "these include searches for several elements ( f has value 1 on several elements ) @xcite , searches in which @xmath3 is arbitrary @xcite , and searches in which the initial amplitude distribution of the component states is arbitrary @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the algorithm is optimally efficient @xcite .",
    "further development is described in other work @xcite . however , as has been recently emphasized @xcite , all these searches depend on the fact that the evolving state is and remains a coherent superposition of components corresponding to elements of the data base .",
    "the description in section [ exqs ] of the quantum search was for the initial memory state @xmath68 .",
    "however if the memory system lattice is in the initial state @xmath133 then the description also applies to each component state @xmath134 .",
    "as was the case for the initial state @xmath112 , the state @xmath135 can be efficiently prepared from the state @xmath136 using the walsh - hadamard transformation .",
    "@xmath137 on each qubit of @xmath0 . for this initial memory state",
    "all @xmath138 searches are carried out coherently .",
    "since the path lengths range from @xmath24 to @xmath139 , the quantum robot can search all sites of @xmath61 and return to the origin in @xmath140 steps .",
    "since this is less than the number of steps , @xmath141 , required by a classical robot , the question arises if grover s algorithm can be used to process the final memory state to determine the location of @xmath63 . if this is possible , the overall search and processing should require @xmath140 steps which is less than that required by a classical robot .",
    "it is worth a digression at this point to see that grover s algorithm is not applicable to the usual method of recording the presence or absence of @xmath63 at a site . to see this assume that @xmath63 is at site @xmath142 and that an extra qubit , @xmath143 of the memory is set aside to record the presence or absence of @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath143 is initially in state @xmath144 and is changed to state @xmath145 only in the presence of @xmath63 , then the initial memory state @xmath146 is changed to the final memory state latexmath:[\\[\\phi_{f}= ( 1/n)(\\sum_{x , y\\neq x_{0}y_{0}}|x , y\\rangle_{m}|0\\rangle_{r } + |x_{0},y_{0}\\rangle_{m }    to the origin of @xmath61 .",
    "the idea then would be to use grover s algorithm @xcite by carrying out @xmath3 iterations of a unitary operator @xmath148 to amplify the component state @xmath149 at the expense of the other components .",

    "@xmath154 is the identity on other memory degrees of freedom .",
    "it is clear that for this case iterations of @xmath148 can be carried out efficiently .",

    "this is not efficient as it requires @xmath140 steps . in the language of much of the work on grover s algorithm this corresponds to the fact that it requires @xmath140 steps to determine the value of the oracle function instead of just one step as is usually assumed . in this case",
    "the advantage of quantum over classical searching is lost for 2 dimensional regions as use of grover s algorithm would require @xmath167 searches each requiring @xmath168 steps .",
    "this suggests that a method be considered in which the grover iterations are done prior to return when the quantum robot is at the path endpoint . at this point",
    "the component memory states are entangled with the quantum robot position states as the overall state has the form latexmath:[$(1/n)\\sum_{x , y}|x , y\\rangle_{m }    robot position state for the site @xmath66 .    in this case",
    "@xmath166 can be efficiently carried out on each initial component memory state @xmath134 by a local observation to see if @xmath63 is or is not at the site @xmath66 .",

    "the problem is that there is no efficient way to carry out more than one iteration of @xmath148 . as noted above the first iteration",
    "can be done efficiently .",
    "however additional iterations require that the action of @xmath166 on memory component states @xmath176 be evaluated for arbitrary values of @xmath177 while the quantum robot remains at site @xmath66 .",
    "this can not be done efficiently as the quantum robot has no way of knowing whether @xmath63 is or is not at these different locations . to know this",
    "the quantum robot must go to the site @xmath177 to see if @xmath63 is there .",
    "this is inefficient as such a trip requires @xmath178 steps.(actions are efficient if they require @xmath64 steps or less .",
    "low powers of @xmath4 are also acceptable . )",

    "it is of interest to note that quantum searches of higher dimensional space regions combined with grover s algorithm are more efficient than classical searches . to see this assume a search of a d dimensional cube of @xmath180 sites with the memory in the initial state @xmath181    carrying out grover s algorithm requires @xmath182 iterations of @xmath148 where , as before",
    ", each iteration of @xmath148 requires @xmath178 steps .",

    "these problems , which apply to all the above cases , result from the fact that the task evolution , starting from the initial unentangled product state @xmath187 , generates entanglements between the position states @xmath188 of the quantum robot and the components @xmath68 of the memory state @xmath135 . in order for grover s algorithm to work it",
    "is necessary to remove this entanglement at the end of each search cycle or iteration of @xmath148 so that the final memory state is @xmath189 .",
    "this entanglement occurs because the unitary dynamics is reversible and the number of steps needed to complete the search task is different for different component states of @xmath135 . here",
    "the number ranges from @xmath190 for the path @xmath191 to @xmath192 for the path @xmath193 .",
    "this means that the various components of the quantum robot complete an iteration of @xmath148 at different times .",
    "this is independent of whether the algorithm is completed after or prior to return .    because of the reversibility each component can not simply stop and wait until the longest search component is complete .",
    "it must instead embark on motion of irrelevant or ballistic degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that the memory components @xmath68 exchange entanglement with the quantum robot position states for entanglement with states of ballistic degrees of freedom .",
    "since use of grover s algorithm requires the removal of this entanglement @xcite , the question arises whether it is possible to insert delays into each of the memory components that are computed , for example , after the quantum robot returns to the origin of @xmath61 at the end of each cycle .",
    "if this works then there would be some time or step number at which the entanglement is removed and the original product structure of the initial state recovered , with @xmath189 replacing @xmath135 .",
    "this use of delays to remove the entanglements reversibly requires that no memory of the magnitude of the delay be left in the delay degrees of freedom .",
    "otherwise one ends up with entanglement with the delay degrees of freedom . also determining the magnitude of each delay is not trivial as it depends not only on the lengths of each of the paths but on the number of steps in the computation phases used to determine motion along the paths .",
    "this includes the dependence of the number of steps required to subtract @xmath39 from a number @xmath92 on the value of @xmath92 ( through the number of `` carry @xmath39 '' operations needed @xcite ) .",
    "based on these considerations it is seems doubtful that one can use grover s algorithm to efficiently process the results of a quantum search of a space region @xmath61 . even if the entanglement problem were solvable , the above results show that , for 2 dimensional space regions , use of grover s algorithm is no more efficient than a classical search . for higher dimensional searches",
    "the algorithm is more efficient .",
    "note that this conclusion is independent of the details of the quantum robot .",
    "it applies to any quantum system such as a mobile head that contains sufficient information on board to tell it where to go , what to do on arrival at the endpoint , and how to return to the origin .",
    "in spite of these pessimistic results , quantum robots are interesting objects of study . for instance they may be useful test beds for study of control of quantum systems @xcite as the dependence of the task dynamics on the local environmental state is , for some tasks , similar to a feedback loop .",
    "quantum robots and the associated task dynamics also make clear what is and is not being done in any task .",
    "this is shown by the quantum search task in that the quantum robot does no monitoring or control of its behavior .",
    "it ( or the on board quantum computer ) has no knowledge of where it is in @xmath61 at any point or even if it is in @xmath61 . for each component memory state @xmath68",
    "there are @xmath70 computation phases with the output system o in state @xmath83 and @xmath71 phases with o in state @xmath86 .",
    "these phases are interspersed with @xmath70 and @xmath71 action phases during which anything can happen .",
    "for example the quantum robot might move outside @xmath61 or it might not move at all .",
    "of course for these cases it is unlikely that the quantum robot would return to the origin at the end of the task .",
    "this illustrates a valuable aspect of the description of the task dynamics of quantum robots as sequences of alternating computation and action phases .",
    "this is that , for the search task examples described here , it makes very clear the lack of awareness and control the quantum robot has over what has happened in the action phases and what it is doing .",
    "this argument applies to the computation phases also .",
    "for example the `` subtract @xmath39 '' steps could carry out an arbitrary change to the memory state and the task would continue . in this case the task would no longer be a search task but would be something else .",
    "these considerations are also part of foundational reasons why quantum robots and quantum computers are interesting .",
    "if quantum mechanics ( or some extension such as quantum field theory ) is assumed to be universally applicable , then all systems involved in the validation of quantum mechanics are quantum systems .",
    "this includes the systems that make theoretical computations ( which includes quantum computers ) and the systems that carry out experiments ( which includes quantum robots ) .",
    "thus , in some sense quantum mechanics must describe its own validation , to the maximum extent possible .",
    "exploration of this and the questions of self consistency and possible incompleteness that may occur make this an interesting path of inquiry .",
    "* it is aware of its environment ? * it has significant characteristics of intelligence ? *",
    "it changes states of some quantum systems so that the new states can be interpreted as text having meaning to the system generating the text @xcite ?",
    "in addition there is a sense in which the existence problem for quantum systems having all these properties is already solved .",
    "that is , these systems include the readers , and hopefully the author , of this paper .",
