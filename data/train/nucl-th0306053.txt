    "can bound - state properties be deduced from scattering data ?",
    "the answer to this question showed interesting evolutions throughout the history of quantum scattering theory ( see foreword by r.  g.  newton in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , starting with heisenberg s conjecture in the early forties that the scattering ( s ) matrix contains all physical information , including that regarding bound states .",
    "this conjecture was later seriously weakened in the framework of the potential model : in 1949 , bargmann @xcite constructed potentials that share the same s matrix for partial wave @xmath5 ( so - called _ phase - equivalent _ potentials because they share the same scattering phase shifts ) but have different bound - state properties [ different energies , or identical energies but different wave functions ] . on the other hand , that same year , levinson ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) proved that , for a given partial wave @xmath8 , the number of bound states , @xmath9 , can be deduced from the phase shifts .",
    "these results were then explained by the inverse - problem theory @xcite , which shows that for a given partial wave the potential is uniquely determined by ( i ) the scattering phase shifts at all energies , ( ii ) the bound - state energies and ( iii ) one additional real parameter for each bound - state wave function [ e.g. , the asymptotic normalization constant ( anc ) , see definition ( [ eq : ancdef ] ) ] .",
    "this only applies to local central potentials displaying no singularity .",
    "levinson s theorem , however , was generalized by swan in 1963 @xcite , who proved that @xmath9 can not be deduced from the s matrix for potentials displaying an @xmath10 repulsive singularity at the origin . since then",
    ", the construction of phase - equivalent potentials for a given partial wave has known important progress @xcite thanks to the use of the algebraic formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite used below ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potanc ] ) .",
    "as far as only one partial wave is concerned , the answer to the above question is thus rather clear - cut : neither the number of bound states , nor their energies nor their ancs can be deduced from the s matrix alone .",
    "moreover , these bound - state properties are independent of one another , which means that knowing , for instance , both the s matrix and a bound - state energy does not constrain the value of the anc as long as no other physical information is available on this particular bound state ( e.g. , its radius or its lifetime ) or on the considered system in general ( e.g. , the range of the interaction ) . this impossibility proof being established in the framework of the potential model , which is a particular case of more general models ( e.g. , microscopic or phenomenological models )",
    ", it holds for these more general models too .",
    "however , several works @xcite seem to ignore this argument and aim at extracting the anc of a bound - state with known energy from the corresponding partial - wave s matrix . in refs .",
    "@xcite for instance , the reaction- ( r-)matrix formalism @xcite is used to extract the anc of an @xmath11o bound state from @xmath0c + @xmath1 elastic - scattering data . in the r - matrix phenomenological model , it is rather natural to assume that bound states have a measurable impact on the partial - wave s matrix , like elastic - scattering resonances , because both bound and resonant states are characterized by an energy and a reduced width . however , in scattering theory , bound and resonant states have very different natures , and the above impossibility argument seriously questions the anc extraction of refs .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : r - matrix ] , i show how that misuse of the r - matrix formalism actually explains the inconsistency between the anc values obtained in these references . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : susy ] , i explicitly construct simple potential models which illustrate the independence of the bound - state anc from the phase shifts for a single partial wave .    now , considering several partial waves simultaneously leads to a less clear situation .",
    "the inverse - problem theory implies that a regular interaction potential is uniquely determined by phase shifts of a given partial wave with angular momentum high enough so that the partial wave contains no bound state . using inversion techniques @xcite , a unique potential",
    "can thus in principle be deduced from such phase shifts ; this potential can in turn be used for lower partial waves , for which it may sustain bound states . in that case ,",
    "bound state properties ( of low partial waves ) are totally determined by scattering phase shifts ( of a high partial wave ) .",
    "however , this program presents three difficulties .",
    "first , it assumes that the potential is local and energy independent , which , in general , is not a realistic approximation when the interacting particles have an internal structure ( see the discussion in secs .",
    "[ sec : inversion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] for the particular case of @xmath0c + @xmath1 ) .",
    "second , it requires that the interaction be independent of the partial wave , which is not always the case : scattering phase shifts of several partial waves are not necessarily compatible with one unique potential .",
    "third , it is based on the knowledge of the phase shifts of a high - angular - momentum partial wave at _ all energies _ , which are generally not available : at high energy , the complexity of multichannel effects increases , which makes the data difficult to analyze ; and at low energy , the phase shifts of high - angular - momentum partial waves are very small because of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "hence , considering several partial waves at the same time may help deducing bound - state properties from scattering data , but the practical applicability of the method could strongly depend on the considered system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : inversion ] , i show that for the particular case of @xmath0c + @xmath1",
    "encouraging results are obtained by considering several partial waves at the same time , in the framework of a simplified model in which @xmath0c and @xmath1 are considered as rigid nuclei in their @xmath12 ground state , interacting through a local energy- and angular - momentum - independent potential .",
    "these results are then compared with more sophisticated models available in the literature .",
    "conclusions and perspectives for the @xmath0c + @xmath1 system are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the @xmath0c + @xmath1 system is particularly important in nuclear astrophysics since the @xmath0c ( @xmath1 , @xmath13 ) @xmath11o capture is a key reaction in the helium - burning phase of red giant stars : by competing with the triple @xmath1 reaction ( leading to @xmath0c ) , it determines the ratio of carbon and oxygen which results from stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "experimentally , the coulomb repulsion between @xmath0c and @xmath1 makes the direct measurement of the capture reaction impossible at the very low energies of astrophysical interest ( around 300 kev in the center - of - mass frame ) .",
    "hence , available experimental results at higher energies ( @xmath14 mev ) have to be extrapolated to these low energies .",
    "this extrapolation , generally performed with the r - matrix model ( the only model to date able to precisely fit all the available data ) , is itself problematic because of the presence of two @xmath11o bound states just below the @xmath0c + @xmath1 threshold .",
    "whereas the influence of the @xmath15 kev state is well understood @xcite , the influence of the @xmath16 kev state is still the major source of uncertainty on the reaction rate @xcite .",
    "the unknown key quantity is its anc ( the energies of both states are well known ) , which is related to its @xmath1 reduced width in the r - matrix formalism ( i do not use reduced widths here since they depend on the r - matrix radius , which makes comparison between different models difficult ) .",
    "the @xmath17 kev subthreshold state has a positive parity and a @xmath18 angular momentum ( @xmath2 state ) ; microscopic cluster models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) suggest that its structure is dominated by a @xmath0c cluster and an @xmath1 cluster , both in their fundamental @xmath12 state , with a relative motion of angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "it is thus on the phase shifts of this partial wave that one could naively expect to see the influence of the @xmath2 state , and it is from these phase shifts that one could try to extract its anc , @xmath3 ( where the second index refers to @xmath4 and the first index means that this state is the lowest one for this partial wave ) .",
    "this constant is defined by the asymptotic behavior of the radial part , @xmath19 , of the relative wave function between the @xmath0c and @xmath1 nuclei for this particular bound state : u_12(r ) _ r c_12 w_-6.615 , 5/2 ( 0.3751 r ) , where @xmath20 is the radial coordinate ( in fm ) and @xmath21 is the whittaker function @xcite ( a decreasing exponential function in the absence of coulomb interaction ) .    in ref .",

    "@xcite are analyzed by the r - matrix model , leading to a minimum in the @xmath22 ( see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) for @xmath23 @xmath7 . however",
    ", this extraction is very delicate since the influence of the subthreshold state has to be disentangled from the background phase shifts in the energy region where experimental data are available ; this influence is smaller ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) than the main components of this background , i.e. , the hard - sphere and high - energy - pole phase shifts . as a consequence ,",
    "this minimum strongly depends on the range of data fitted ( see fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover",
    ", i have checked that the minimum is highly sensitive to the high - energy background - pole energy , which is fixed at 10 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite . without this restriction , very different values of @xmath3",
    "are obtained ; hence , the error on @xmath3 , which is not estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , is actually very large .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0c + @xmath1 elastic scattering has been remeasured with very high precision .",
    "an r - matrix analysis with free high - energy - pole energies leads to a @xmath22 minimum ( see fig .  2 ( a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) for @xmath24 @xmath7 .",
    "the error bar on @xmath3 is estimated by following the guideline @xcite ^2 < ^2 _ + 9 ^2_/ , [ eq : chi2 ] where @xmath25 is the minimal @xmath22 and @xmath26 is the number of degrees of freedom . in the present case",
    ", one has @xmath27 ( the @xmath22 of fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite have to be divided by the 32 reference angles ) , for 11392 data points and 65 parameters ( 32 r - matrix parameters and 33 experimental parameters ) , which leads to @xmath28 .",
    "following the theory of @xmath22 minimization @xcite , one finds that the probability of having @xmath29 for @xmath28 is of the order of @xmath30 , which probably indicates that some systematic errors have been underestimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . consequently , eq .  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) can not be used to define error bars on parameters since this equation only takes into account statistical errors and requires that the fit be good in the sense of @xmath22 theory . a less rigorous way of checking the validity of a fit is to use the `` chi - by - eye '' approach @xcite . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the fit looks good ( see fig .  1 of this reference ) , which is related to the fact that @xmath31 is not that far from 1",
    ". however , the fits obtained with @xmath32 or @xmath33 @xmath7 , which correspond to @xmath34 , look probably equally good .",
    "i thus consider that the error bar on @xmath3 obtained in ref.@xcite is underestimated .    in summary ,",
    "the values of @xmath3 obtained in both refs.@xcite and @xcite are most probably unreliable , for different reasons .",
    "this explains why , despite the fact that the @xmath4 phase shifts of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are compatible with one another , their r - matrix analyses give totally incompatible results for @xmath3 .",
    "one might think that this inconsistency is due to the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite all relevant partial waves are taken into account whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite only @xmath4 is considered . however , since the r - matrix formalism is based on a partial - wave decomposition of the cross section , @xmath3 is actually independent of the @xmath35 parameters ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , the only influence of the @xmath35 phase shifts on @xmath4 comes through the choice of a common r - matrix radius for all partial waves ; however , this does not seem to strongly constrain the fit of the @xmath4 phase shifts , as discussed in the next paragraph ) .",
    "i argue that this incompatibility rather illustrates the impossibility , well - known in quantum scattering theory , of deducing a bound - state anc when only the bound - state energy and the elastic - scattering phase shifts of the corresponding partial wave are known .",
    "let us however notice that , in the case of the r - matrix phenomenological model , this impossibility is probably not as strong as in general scattering theory . as shown in the next section ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : potanc ] ) , the range of a @xmath0c + @xmath1 interaction that reproduces both the @xmath4 phase shifts and the bound - state energy increases with the value of @xmath3 . but the r - matrix formalism is only valid when the nuclear interaction is negligible above the r - matrix radius . in the r - matrix _ theory",
    "_ , where the number of r - matrix poles is infinite @xcite , this does not cause any problem : the results are independent of the r - matrix radius , which can thus be chosen as large as necessary ( in other words , it would be possible to calculate an r - matrix for any of the potentials plotted in fig .  [ fig : potanc ] but the r - matrix radius should be larger than the potential range ) . in the r - matrix _ phenomenological model _ , where the number of poles is limited to the number of bound states and resonances in the energy interval considered , plus one possible high - energy pole to help simulating the background , a constraint appears on the r - matrix radius : in ref .",
    "@xcite , a value of 5.5 - 6 fm is found , based on the @xmath36 partial wave ; in ref .",
    "@xcite [ see fig .  2",
    "( b ) ] 5.5 fm leads to the best fit ( i have checked that this constraint is mainly due to the @xmath5 partial wave , for which the background is maximal ) ; in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radius is fixed at 6.5 fm . hence , very large values of @xmath3 can probably be excluded by an r - matrix fit ; very small values , on the other hand , can not be excluded .",
    "i could actually find very good fits of the @xmath4 phase shifts with @xmath37 for r - matrix radii in the range 4.5 - 6.5 fm .",
    "this confirms the doubts expressed above on the analyses of refs.@xcite and it shows that , in this particular case , the quality of the fit does not strongly depend on the precise value of the r - matrix radius .",
    "up to now , the discussion is based on general arguments from scattering theory .",
    "let me now construct simplified two - body potential models that illustrate these arguments in the particular case of @xmath0c + @xmath1 , using the supersymmetric - quantum - mechanics @xcite inversion technique of refs .",
    "starting from a phase - shift analysis @xcite of the purely elastic data ( @xmath38 mev ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , i have removed , using the r - matrix formalism , resonances that have a more complicated structure than @xmath0c + @xmath1 in their @xmath12 ground states ( such resonances can not be explained by the present simplified model ) . for @xmath4 ,",
    "this means removing the narrow resonance at 2.683 mev and the wide resonance at 4.358 mev @xcite , which leads to the phase shifts plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] ( the spread of the data above 4.2 mev is due to the difficulty of performing a reliable phase - shift analysis in the vicinity of a resonance ) . by solving the so - called `` singular inverse problem '' defined in ref.@xcite ,",
    "i have constructed a potential that reproduces these phase shifts with very high precision .",
    "this potential has an @xmath10 singularity at the origin and satisfies swan s theorem @xcite ; to simplify further developments , its nuclear part has been approximated by the analytical expression v(r)=v ( -r^2/r^2)/r^2 , where @xmath39 mev @xmath40 and @xmath41 fm .",
    "the corresponding @xmath4 effective potential ( centrifugal barrier plus coulomb and nuclear interactions ) is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : potanc ] ( solid line ) and its phase shifts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] .",
    "surprisingly , a potential of the form ( [ eq : pot ] ) is also able to reproduce the @xmath5 background phase shifts with satisfactory precision , which suggests an alternative way of parameterizing the @xmath0c + @xmath1 background in future r - matrix analyses ( in the spirit of the `` hybrid '' r - matrix model of refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the fit of the @xmath4 scattering phase shifts is very good , despite the fact that potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) has , by construction , _ no bound state _ ( it is purely repulsive ) ; this is a first proof that , from the point of view of scattering theory , the @xmath4 background phase shifts are totally disconnected from the @xmath2 subthreshold bound state .",
    "now , since this state is known to exist and to have a structure such that it could be well simulated by the present simplified model , it is physically meaningful to perform a further step in the inversion of the @xmath4 phase shifts , i.e. , to add a bound state to the above potential without modifying its phase shifts @xcite .",
    "this phase - equivalent bound - state addition may be carried out through a further use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite ; it introduces two arbitrary parameters : the bound - state energy and its anc . in the present case ,",
    "the energy is known experimentally but not the anc ; hence , there is a one - parameter family of @xmath4 effective potentials that share identical phase shifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 ] ) and have a bound - state at @xmath17 kev .",
    "such potentials are represented by dashed lines for three arbitrary values of @xmath3 in fig .",

    "the corresponding bound - state wave functions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] ( dashed lines ) , where their very different asymptotic behaviors are clearly seen .",
    "this proves that , from the @xmath4 phase shifts and bound - state energy only , there is no way of telling what is the best value for @xmath3 , in contrast with r - matrix attempts described above ( see however the discussion of the r - matrix phenomenological model in the previous section ) .",
    "the general discussion from the introduction suggests to look at other partial waves simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath2 subthreshold state is actually a member of a rotational band , together with the @xmath12 bound state at @xmath43 kev and the @xmath44 and @xmath45 resonances at @xmath46 kev ( width : @xmath47 kev ) and @xmath48 kev ( width : @xmath49 kev ) respectively @xcite .",
    "this is indicated by cluster - model calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , which give a fair description of these four states in a single - channel calculation where both the @xmath0c and @xmath1 nuclei are in their @xmath12 ground state .",
    "this suggests to ask the following question : could all these states be reproduced by a unique @xmath8-independent potential ?",
    "of course , in principle , the internal structure of the nuclei could play a role and a satisfactory potential could be non local and energy dependent .",
    "it is however worth testing the simplest hypothesis , i.e. , that of an energy- and @xmath8-independent local potential , because if such a potential were sufficient , it would be strongly constrained by the data of the four partial waves considered simultaneously , which could help solving the @xmath3 indefiniteness .",
    "i could not find such a potential within the above one - parameter potential family .",
    "this is not very surprising since general arguments from the microscopic cluster model show @xcite that @xmath8-independent interaction potentials between nuclei should have low - energy non - physical bound states that simulate the pauli principle between the constituting nucleons [ because of these so - called _ pauli forbidden states _ ( pfss ) , such potentials are _ deep _ , in contrast with _",
    "potentials that only sustain physical bound states ] . for the @xmath4 partial wave of @xmath0c + @xmath1 ,",
    "the expected number of pfss is two @xcite .    in the context of inversion , such bound states complicate things a lot since each of them introduces two additional arbitrary parameters ( neither their energy nor their anc is known experimentally ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , i introduce these states phenomenologically by regularizing the above inversion potential with the expression @xmath50 for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fitting parameters ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 are calculated to make the potential and its first derivative continuous in @xmath53 ) . since this regularization slightly alters the phase shifts , parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq .",

    "altogether , there are thus five parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath3 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) which can be varied to fit all the @xmath58 data at the same time .",

    ", this inversion potential perfectly reproduces the @xmath2 state energy .",
    "the wave function is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] ( solid line ) ; its two nodes are due to its orthogonality to the pfss at @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev , which confirms that the potential is deep .",
    "the corresponding value for @xmath3 is @xmath65 @xmath7 .",
    "i consider this prediction as reliable because all the even phase shifts in the elastic region are also rather well fitted ( for example , the @xmath44 resonance is at @xmath66 kev with width 22 kev ) .",
    "however , this potential underestimates the @xmath12 bound - state energy ( @xmath67 kev ) , as well as the @xmath45 resonance energy ( @xmath68 kev ) and width ( 259 kev ) .",
    "these inaccuracies are probably due to the extreme simplicity of the present model ( energy- and @xmath8-independent local potential ) and it is worth comparing it with more sophisticated models of the literature , which better take into account many - body effects .",
    "the two non - local @xmath8-dependent potentials of ref .",

    "the gaussian potential provides @xmath70 @xmath7 while the woods - saxon potential provides @xmath71 @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple local potential is given , which precisely reproduces the energies of the members of the rotational band , as well as the resonance widths , provided a slight @xmath8 dependence is allowed .",
    "although the number of pfss is three for this potential , which adds a node in the subthreshold - bound - state wave function ( see dash - dotted line in fig .  [",
    "fig : bs ] ) , it provides a value of @xmath3 very similar to the inversion potential : @xmath72 @xmath7 .",
    "i have illustrated on @xmath0c + @xmath1 two general results from the inverse problem in quantum scattering theory : ( i ) for a given partial wave , the scattering phase shifts , the number of bound states , their energies and their ancs are independent of one another ; ( ii ) when several partial waves can be described by the same theoretical model , these quantities may be related to one another .",
    "this is reasonably the case for @xmath0c + @xmath1 , for which i have deduced the anc value of the @xmath2 subthreshold state from the simultaneous analysis of the @xmath58 partial waves , with the help of a local energy- and angular - momentum - independent potential constructed by supersymmetric inversion .",
    "since this potential lies on rather restrictive hypotheses and is not able to exactly fit all the data , i have compared it with results from more sophisticated potential models available in the literature .",
    "all theoretical predictions lie in a rather limited range , @xmath73 @xmath7 , which confirms somehow their overall validity .",

    "calculations should be performed ; however , despite the success of the microscopic cluster model , such calculations are still too primitive to provide precise predictions of all available data .",
