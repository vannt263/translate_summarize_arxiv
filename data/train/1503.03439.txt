    "to model a compact object it is generally assumed that the underlying matter distribution is homogeneous i.e. perfect fluid obeying tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "the nuclear matter of density @xmath8  gm / cc , which is expected at the core of the compact terrestrial object , becomes anisotropic in nature as was first argued by ruderman @xcite . in case of anisotropy the pressure inside the fluid sphere can specifically be decomposed into two parts : radial pressure , @xmath9 and the transverse pressure , @xmath10 , where @xmath10 is in the perpendicular direction to @xmath9 .",
    "their difference @xmath11 is defined as the anisotropic factor .",
    "now , the anisotropic force ( @xmath12 ) will be repulsive in nature if @xmath13 or equivalently @xmath14 and attractive if @xmath15 .",
    "so it is reasonable to consider pressure anisotropy to develop our model under investigation .",
    "it has been shown that in case of anisotropic fluid the existence of repulsive force helps to construct compact objects @xcite .",
    "anisotropy may occur for different reasons in any stellar distribution .",
    "it could be introduced by the existence of the solid core or for the presence of type @xmath16 superfluid @xcite .",
    "different kinds of phase transitions @xcite , pion condensation  @xcite etc .",
    "are also reasonable for anisotropy .",
    "it may also occur by the effects of slow rotation in a star .",
    "bowers and liang @xcite showed that anisotropy might have non - negligible effects on such parameters like equilibrium mass and surface redshift . very recently",
    "other theoretical advances also indicate that the pressure inside a compact object is not essentially isotropic in nature @xcite .    in recent years",
    "the extension of general relativity to higher dimensions has become a topic of great interest . as a special mention in this line of thinking",
    "we note that ` whether the usual solar system tests are compatible with the existence of higher spatial dimensions ' has been investigated by rahaman et al .",
    "some other studies in higher dimension are done by liu and overduin @xcite for the motion of test particle whereas rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated higher dimensional gravastars .",
    "one of the most interesting outcomes of string theory is that the target spacetime coordinates become noncommuting operators on @xmath4-brane  @xcite . now",
    "the noncommutativity of a spacetime can be encoded in the commutator @xmath17=i \\theta^{\\mu \\nu}$ ] , where @xmath18 is an anti - symmetric matrix and is of dimension @xmath19 which determines the fundamental cell discretization of spacetime .",
    "it is similar to the way the planck constant @xmath20 discretizes phase space  @xcite .    in the literature",
    "many studies are available on noncommutative geometry , for example , nazari and mehdipour  @xcite used lorentzian distribution to analyze ` parikh - wilczek tunneling ' from noncommutative higher dimensional black holes . besides this investigation some other noteworthy works are on galactic rotation curves inspired by a noncommutative - geometry background  @xcite , stability of a particular class of thin - shell wormholes in noncommutative geometry  @xcite , higher - dimensional wormholes with noncommutative geometry @xcite , noncommutative btz black hole @xcite , noncommutative wormholes @xcite and noncommutative wormholes in @xmath21 gravity with lorentzian distribution  @xcite .",
    "it is familiar to search for the natural relationship between geometry and matter through the einstein field equations where it is very convenient to use inheritance symmetry .",
    "the well known inheritance symmetry is the symmetry under conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) i.e. @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lie derivative of the metric tensor , which describes the interior gravitational field of a stellar configuration with respect to the vector field @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the conformal factor .",
    "it is supposed that the vector @xmath24 generates the conformal symmetry and the metric @xmath26 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath24 . it is to note that neither @xmath24 nor @xmath25 need to be static even though one considers a static metric  @xcite .",
    "we also note that ( i ) if @xmath27 then eq . ( 1 )",
    "gives the killing vector , ( ii ) if @xmath28 constant it gives homothetic vector and ( iii ) if @xmath29 then it yields conformal vectors .",
    "moreover it is to be mentioned that for @xmath27 the underlying spacetime becomes asymptotically flat which further implies that the weyl tensor will also vanish . so ckv provides a deeper insight of the underlying spacetime geometry .",
    "a large number of works on conformal motion have been done by several authors .",
    "a class of solutions for anisotropic stars admitting conformal motion have been studied by rahaman et al .  @xcite . in a very recent work rahaman",

    "charged gravastar admitting conformal motion has been studied by usmani et al .",

    "inspired by these earlier works on conformal motion we are looking forward for a new class of solutions of anisotropic stars under the framework of general relativity inspired by noncommutative geometry in four and higher dimensional spacetimes .    in the presence of noncommutative geometry",
    "there are two different distributions available in the literature : ( a ) gaussian and ( b ) lorentzian @xcite .",
    "though these two mass distributions represent similar quantitative aspects , for the present investigation we are exploiting a particular lorentzian - type energy density of the static spherically symmetric smeared and particle - like gravitational source in the multi - dimensional general form  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total smeared mass of the source , @xmath32 is the noncommutative parameter which bears a minimal width @xmath33 and @xmath34 is positive integer greater than 1 . in this approach ,",

    ", via a minimal length caused by averaging noncommutative coordinate fluctuations cures the curvature singularity in black holes @xcite . it has been argued that it is not required to consider the length scale of the coordinate noncommutativity to be the same as the planck length as the noncommutativity influences appears on a length scale which can behave as an adjustable parameter corresponding to that pertinent scale @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite have found out a new class of interior solutions for anisotropic compact stars admitting conformal motion under @xmath0 framework of gr . on the other hand , rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite have studied different dimensional fluids , higher as well as lower , inspired by noncommutative geometry with gaussian distribution of energy density and have shown that at @xmath0 only one can get a stable configuration for any spherically symmetric stellar system . however , in the present work we have extended the work of rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite to higher dimensions and that of rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite to higher dimensions with energy density in the form of lorentzian distribution . in this approach",
    "we are able to generalize both the above mentioned works to show that compacts stars may exist even in higher dimensions .    in this paper , therefore we use noncommutative geometry inspired model to combine the microscopic structure of spacetime with the relativistic description of gravity .",
    "the plan of the present investigation is as follows : in section 2 we formulate the einstein field equations for the interior spacetime of the anisotropic star . in section 3",
    "we solve the einstein field equations by using the density function of lorentzian distribution type in higher dimensional spacetime as given by nozari and mehdipour  @xcite .",
    "we consider the cases @xmath35 and @xmath36 i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath3 spacetimes in section 4 to examine expressions for physical parameters whereas the matching conditions are provided in section 5 .",
    "various physical properties are explored in section 6 with interesting features of the model and present them with graphical plots for comparative studies among the results of different dimensional spacetimes .",
    "finally we complete the paper with some concluding remarks in section 7 .",
    "to describe the static spherically symmetric spacetime ( in geometrical units @xmath38 here and onwards ) in higher dimension the line element can be given in the standard form @xmath39 where @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath43 . here",
    "we have used the notation @xmath44 ,  @xmath4 is the dimension of the spacetime .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for the matter distribution can be taken in its usual form @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here",

    "@xmath54 is the measure of anisotropy , as defined earlier .",

    "mathematically , conformal motions or conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) are motions along which the metric tensor of a spacetime remains invariant up to a scale factor .",
    "a conformal vector field can be defined as a global smooth vector field @xmath62 on a manifold , @xmath63 , such that for the metric @xmath64 in any coordinate system on @xmath63 @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the smooth conformal function of @xmath62 , @xmath67 is the conformal bivector of @xmath62 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath68 , ( as considered in eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the usual form ) where @xmath69 signifies the lie derivatives along @xmath70 .    to search the natural relation between geometry and matter through the einstein equations , it is useful to use inheritance symmetry .",
    "the well known inheritance symmetry is the symmetry under conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) .",
    "these provide a deeper insight into the spacetime geometry .",
    "the ckv facilitate generation of exact solutions to the einstein s field equations .",
    "the study of conformal motions in spacetime is physically very important because it can lead to the discovery of conservation laws and devise spacetime classification schemes .",
    "einstein s field equations being highly non linear partial differential equations , one can reduce the partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations by use of ckv .",
    "it is still a challenging problem to the theoretical physicists to know the exact nature and characteristics of compact stars and elementary particle like electron .",
    "let us therefore assume that our static spherically symmetry spacetime admits an one parameter group of conformal motion . the conformal killing vector , as given in eq . ( 1 ) , can be written in a more convenient form : @xmath71 where both @xmath72 and @xmath73 take the values @xmath74 .",
    "here @xmath25 is an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate @xmath43 and @xmath24 is the orbit of the group .",
    "the metric @xmath75 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath76 .    let us further assume that the orbit of the group to be orthogonal to the velocity vector field of the fluid , @xmath77    as a consequence of the spherically symmetry from eq .",
    "( 10 ) we have @xmath78 now the conformal killing equation for the line element ( 3 ) gives the following equations : @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    where @xmath83 stands for the spatial coordinates @xmath43,`@xmath60 ' and ` @xmath84 ' denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "the above set of equations consequently gives @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    where @xmath89 stands for the ` kronecker delta ' and @xmath90 ,  @xmath91 are constants of integrations .",
    "using eqs .",

    "( 18)-(20 ) with four unknowns @xmath52 ,  @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 ,  @xmath25 .",
    "so we are free to choose any physically reasonable _ ansatz _ for any one of these four unknowns .",
    "hence we choose density profile @xmath52 in the form given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) in connection to higher dimensional static and spherically symmetric lorentzian distribution of smeared matter as provided by nozari and mehdipour  @xcite .",
    "this density profile will be employed as a key tool in our present study .    therefore , substituting eq .",
    "( 2 ) into ( 18 ) and solving , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a constant of integration which is determined by invoking suitable boundary conditions .",

    "we note that integration of @xmath207 from @xmath208 to @xmath99 , where @xmath99 is the radius of the fluid distribution , gives @xmath31 ( total mass of the source ) i.e. @xmath209r^n \\rho dr.\\ ] ] this equation gives the radius @xmath99 of the fluid distribution .",

    "it is observed that for all the physical parameters the features are as usual for @xmath0 , however for extra dimension they take different shapes . a special mention can be done for density where central densities are abruptly decreasing as one goes to higher dimensions .",
    "thus , from the plot it reveals that the central density is maximum for @xmath0 whereas it is minimum for @xmath3 spacetime showing most compactness of the star for standard @xmath176-dimension . note that this same result was observed in fig 5 ( left panel ) .",

    "in the present paper we have studied thoroughly a set of new interior solutions for anisotropic stars admitting conformal motion in higher dimensional noncommutative spacetime . under this spacetime geometry the einstein field equations are solved by choosing a particular lorentzian type density distribution function as proposed by nozari and mehdipour @xcite .",
    "the studies are conducted not only with standard @xmath0 dimensional spacetime but also for three special cases with higher dimension , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in general",
    "it is noted that the model parameters e.g. matter - energy density , radial as well as transverse pressures , anisotropy and others show physical behaviours which are mostly regular throughout the stellar configuration .",
    "also it is specially observed that the solutions represent a star with mass @xmath5  @xmath6 and radius @xmath7  km which falls within the range ( @xmath214 ) of a compact star @xcite .",

    "it is observed that for higher dimensions , i.e. beyond @xmath0 spacetime , the solutions exhibit several interesting yet bizarre features .",
    "these features seem physically not very unrealistic .",
    "thus , as a primary stage , the investigation indicates that compact stars may exist even in higher dimensions .",
    "but before placing a demand in favour of this highly intrigued issue of compact stars with extra dimensions we need to perform more specific studies and to look at the diversified technical aspects related to higher dimensional spacetimes of a compact star . basically our approach , dependent on a particular energy density distribution of lorenztian type , which gives higher dimensional existence of compact stars may not be only the way to have sufficient evidence in favour of it .",
    "we further need to employ other type of density distributions as well .",
    "moreover , one may also think for other than higher dimensional embedding of gtr and thus opt for alternative theories of gravity to find conclusive proof for higher dimensional compact stars .",
    "however , in the literature there are some evidences available in favour of ` extra dimensions in compact stars ' @xcite .",
