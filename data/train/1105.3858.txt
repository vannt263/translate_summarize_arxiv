    "s bergman @xcite first gave a general formula for the effective hall coefficient involving currents that solve the symmetric conductivity equations in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , there are few explicit formulas for the effective hall coefficient except in very particular cases like two - phase two - dimensional composites @xcite , or columnar composites @xcite .",
    "the situation is still less favorable in the strong field case @xcite , namely when the symmetric part and the antisymmetric part of the conductivity are of the same order . in three dimensions ,",
    "only when the antisymmetric part is constant do we have an exact formula for the antisymmetric part of the effective tensor @xcite .",
    "so , rather than trying to get explicit relations for the effective tensors it seems more practical to derive bounds .",
    "the theory of the bounds in homogenization has gone through a considerable development since the original variational approach of hashin and shtrikman @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive survey .",
    "in fact , very little is known about bounds for strong field magneto - transport .",
    "recently , we derived in @xcite optimal bounds for multiphase columnar composites .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend , at least partially , the result of @xcite to two - phase three - dimensional composites .    in the present context",
    "we consider a three - dimensional conductor having a periodic structure ( this is actually not a restrictive assumption ) in the presence of a fixed vertical strong magnetic field . under the transverse isotropy assumption",
    "the local conductivity of the conductor takes the general form [ isocon ] ( y)=    a(y ) & -c(y ) & 0 + c(y ) & a(y ) & 0 + 0 & 0 & b(y )    , y^3 , where the coefficient @xmath1 is induced by the presence of the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath2-axis , which also influences @xmath3 and @xmath4 and causes them to be non - equal in the case of a conductor that is isotropic in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "similarly , assuming an transversely isotropic microstructure , or at least one that is invariant under @xmath5 or @xmath6 rotations about the @xmath2-axis , the constant effective conductivity of the composite is given by [ isocon * ] _ * =    a _ * & -c _ * & 0 + c _ * & a _ * & 0 + 0 & 0 & b _ *    . our goal is to derive bounds for the effective coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 of @xmath10 in terms of the coefficients @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 of the local conductivity @xmath11 .    in section [ s.elem ]",

    "we show ( see theorem  [ thm.bou ] ) that contrary to the columnar case of @xcite , it is not possible to bound the antisymmetric part of the effective conductivity @xmath10 only in terms of the coefficients @xmath1 . indeed , when @xmath11 is independent of @xmath2 for a vertical columnar structure , the key ingredient for the derivation of the optimal bounds in @xcite is based on the positivity of the @xmath13 determinant of the local electric field @xcite , i.e. [ posdet ]",

    "due to a suitably constructed rank - two laminate with high - contrast conductivity , we prove simultaneously that the inequality .",
    "does not hold , and that arbitrarily large effective coefficients @xmath9 can be obtained while the local coefficient @xmath1 is bounded .",
    "this negative result agrees with the pathologies obtained in @xcite with different microstructures , related to bounds on the effective hall coefficient in the low magnetic field regime . as a consequence ,",
    "a bound for @xmath9 involves both the upper bound for @xmath15 and the bounds from below and above for @xmath3 in .",

    "this bound shows @xmath16 when the upper bound on @xmath15 goes to zero , provided @xmath3 remains bounded from below and above .    in section [ s.hsbou ] , to improve the previous bounds we restrict ourselves to a two - phase local conductivity [ isocon2 ] ( y)=_1(y )    a_1 & -c_1 & 0 + c_1 & a_1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & b_1    + _ 2(y )    a_2 & -c_2 & 0 + c_2 & a_2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & b_2    , y^3 , with prescribed volume fraction @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
