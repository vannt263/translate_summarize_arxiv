    "the legacy survey sings ( spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ) wants to characterise the infrared emission across the entire range of galaxy properties and star formation environments , including regions that until now have been inaccessible at infrared wavelengths ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sings will provide :    * new insights into the physical processes connecting star formation to the ism properties of galaxies ; * a vital foundation of data , diagnostic tools , and astrophysical inputs for understanding spitzer observations of the distant universe and ultraluminous and active galaxies ; * an archive that integrates visible / uv and ir / submillimeter studies into a coherent self - consistent whole , and enables many follow - up investigations of star formation and of the ism .",
    "the spitzer observations will provide images in 7 different bands from 3.6@xmath2mto 160@xmath2mand spectroscopic data at medium and low resolution in the range 595@xmath2 m .",
    "these data will be used to trace the distribution and content of different dust components , from the pahs and very small grains in the mid - ir , to the big grains in the far - ir ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "ancillary multiwavelength observations will provide images in x - rays , uv ( 13002800   imaging and spectrophotometry ) , bvrijhk , h@xmath0 , pa@xmath0 , fir , submillimeter , co and @xmath3 .",
    "a total of 20 ground- and space - based telescopes are providing supporting data .",
    "these data will help understand the process of star formation and feedback mechanisms that are fundamental parameters regulating the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "history of star formation has been strongly different for galaxies of different morphological type and luminosity . while short events of star formation , probably triggered by violent merging , formed most stars in elliptical galaxies , late - type systems seem to have their star formation modulated by the angular momentum ( , ) or by the mass of the initial system ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the process of star formation and feedback must thus be clearly understood in order to understand galaxies evolution .",
    "however , these physical processes are still poorly known .",
    "the primordial atomic gas has to condense into molecular clouds to form stars .",
    "the newly formed stars inject metals into the interstellar medium via stellar winds , heat the dust and ionise the surrounding gas .",
    "it seems that the activity of star formation is regulated by the total gas surface density ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but it is still unclear what is the role of rotation in this process .",
    "even as important as it seems , no gathering of optical kinematical data was planned for the sings galaxies .",
    "this paper , by providing the h@xmath0 kinematics over the whole optical extent for 28 galaxies of the sings sample , wants to make up for this lack",
    ". a total of 58 sings galaxies are potentially observable in the h@xmath0 emission line ( see section [ sample_section ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 kinematics of the 30 remaining galaxies of the observable part of the sample will be published in a forthcoming paper .",
    "these data were obtained with ` fantomm ` on three different telescopes ( see section [ obs_runs_section ] ) . `",
    "fantomm ` is an integral field spectrometer made of a photon - counting camera using a third generation photo - cathode , a scanning fabry - perot ( fp ) and a narrow - band interference filter . `",
    "fantomm ` was coupled to the focal reducer of the telescopes used .",
    "the photo - cathode used has a high quantum efficiency ( @xmath4 30% at h@xmath0 ) .",
    "this camera enables one to scan rapidly ( @xmath4 510 minutes ) the fp free spectral range ( fsr ) and to cycle many times during an observation , thus averaging changing photometrical conditions , as compared to ccd observations where scanning must be done slowly to overcome the readout noise ( details about the camera can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , section 2 gives an overview of the observational campaign and of the galaxies studied .",
    "section 3 discusses how the data were reduced , processed and how the kinematical data and parameters were extracted .",
    "section 4 provides all the maps extracted from the work done in section 3 .",
    "section 5 discusses the advantages of fp kinematical data as compared to other kinematical data .",
    "a short appendix is added to comment the observational characteristics of the galaxies presented .",
    "once completed , the data set will be available in the sings database , as for the other sings ancillary surveys .            [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath5photometrical parameters taken from the rc3 catalog .",
    "+ @xmath6it is useless or impossible to determine the kinematical parameters for this galaxy due either to the lack of large - scale rotation or the interaction with another galaxy .",
    "+ @xmath7a 180@xmath8 rotation was applied to the photometrical pa in order to be able to compare it with the kinematical pa .",
    "+ @xmath9the photometrical and kinematical @xmath10 do not agree even with a 180@xmath8 rotation .",
    "this usually happens for face - on galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath11this photometrical parameter was not available in the rc3 database and was taken from the 2mass large galaxies atlas .",
    "+ [ kinematics ]      the rotcur routine in the gipsy package was used to find the kinematical parameters of the galaxies studied .",
    "rotcur works by fitting tilted ring models to velocity information found in the velocity maps .",
    "@xmath12 is obtained using the following equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the systemic velocity of the system studied , @xmath15 is the rotation velocity , @xmath16 the expansion ( non - circular ) velocity , @xmath17 the inclination of the ring and @xmath18 and @xmath19 the polar coordinates in the plane of the galaxy . the same procedure was used for all the galaxies of the sample . to allow for a good sampling frequency",
    ", the ring width used was always at least 3 times the pixel size .",
    "the extraction of the kinematical parameters is done as follows .",
    "the photometrical parameters of the galaxies ( position angle ( @xmath10 ) , inclination ( @xmath17 ) ) are taken from the rc3 catalog as initial parameters .",
    "the photometrical inclination is calculated as @xmath20 .",
    "the rough rotational center of the galaxies is taken by looking at the continuum maps extracted at section [ rvmap_section ] and taking the point where the continuum is the highest near the center of the galaxy ( usually obvious for spiral galaxies , trickier for irregular , low surface brightness and distorted ones ) .",
    "the starting point of the systemic velocity is the one used to select the interference filters , as explained in section [ hardware_section ] .",
    "the initial photometrical pa must be sometimes corrected ( @xmath21180@xmath8 ) to properly represent the kinematical @xmath10 , that is , the angle from north eastwards to the receding side of the galaxy .",
    "also , gipsy does not take into account the field rotation of the supplied radial velocity map .",
    "the starting @xmath10 is adjusted in order to reflect this .",
    "first , rotcur is run to find the real kinematical center of the galaxy and its systemic velocity by fixing both @xmath10 and @xmath17 and leaving the other parameters free .",
    "the analysis of the output of rotcur is made with idl routines that permit the extraction of statistics on the free parameters , such as median , mean , error weighted mean , standard deviation and linear fit .",
    "if the output is too noisy , rotcur was run again , starting with another set of initial parameters , until the median of the absolute residual of the computed model was below 10kms@xmath22 .",
    "then , having properly determined the kinematical center and the systemic velocity , the real kinematical @xmath10 and inclination were set as free parameters , fixing all the others .",
    "finally , having found the five kinematical parameters ( x@xmath23 , y@xmath23 , @xmath14 , @xmath10 and @xmath17 ) , they were fixed and rotcur was run again to find @xmath15 .",
    "it was decided to use fixed values of @xmath10 and @xmath17 across the whole galaxy as disks are rarely warped inside their optical part .",
    "warps are mainly seen in disks for @xmath24 .",
    "however , the pa is observed to vary as function of radius for some galaxies ( e.g. ) .",
    "the pa value is thus chosen in part of the disk where it reaches an almost constant value .",
    "the errors on the kinematical parameters found can thus be artificially lowered since the non - axisymmetric parts of the galaxies are discarded from the fit . for barred galaxies ,",
    "this involved restricting the fit outside the bar . for non - barred galaxies ,",
    "the outer parts were removed from the fit when the errors were larger than four times the means error .",
    "the kinematical parameters found by means of the method described in section [ kinematics_section ] are presented in table [ kinematics ] .    in appendix [ images_results ] , for each galaxy of the sample , the xdss blue image , the spitzer 3.6@xmath2mimage , the h@xmath0 monochromatic image , where the continuum has been suppressed , and the rv map are provided . a position - velocity",
    "( pv ) diagram is given when it was possible to extract the kinematical parameters from the radial velocity map .",
    "the red line superposed to the pv diagram is the velocity of the major axis of the galaxy s model reconstructed from its rotation curve .",
    "all images for a given galaxy have the same angular scale .",
    "blue , ir and h@xmath0 monochromatic images have a logarithmic intensity scale .",
    "the color scales of the radial velocity maps and the pv diagrams are linear .    since the calibrations and the observations are most of the time done through different interference filters , the presented monochromatic maps could not be flux calibrated .",
    "the rotation curves , extracted as explained in section [ kinematics_section ] , are presented in appendix [ rotation_curves ] .",
    "the errors given for the velocity points are the difference between the approaching and the receding side of the galaxy or the formal error given by rotcur , whichever is the largest .",
    "we think that this is a better estimate than using directly the formal error of ` rotcur ` since this will take into account possible asymmetries between the two sides of the galaxies .",
    "the rotation curves are available in electronic form at http://www.astro.umontreal.ca/fantomm/sings/rotation_curves.htm .",
    "in this section , we discuss the advantages and limitations of h@xmath0 kinematical observations using integral field spectroscopy over other kinematical observational methods .      of course , the signal coverage of the h@xmath0 observations is less extended than for the @xmath3 observations but it allows to resolve the rising part of the rotation curve with greater precision .",
    "figure [ ngc5055_h1_ha ] shows a 21-cm pv diagram of ngc 5055 taken from ( ) . from the 21-cm data alone",
    ", one can calculate that the maximum velocity gradient at the center of the galaxy is of the order of @xmath25 .",
    "the red line shows the rotation curve derived from the h@xmath0 data , which has a maximum gradient of @xmath26 .",
    "this shows how the 21-cm data are affected by beam smearing . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the beam full width half power ( fwhp ) is 49@xmath27x 73@xmath27 while the h@xmath0 resolution is 1.6@xmath27x 1.6@xmath27 .    the rising part of the rotation curve is crucial in the determination of the dark - to - luminous mass ratio ( @xcite , @xcite ) and in the determination of the mass model parameters . for the sake of comparison , maximum achievable 21-cm beam width at the vla in b configuration",
    "is @xmath44@xmath27 usable only for the strongest emitting galaxies , while it is @xmath412.5@xmath27 in c configuration , where sensitivity is high enough to observe the weak galaxies signal .",
    "harbors double emission lines in its center , as noted by ( ) . resolving such details needs both the high spatial and spectral resolution of the integral field spectroscopy used throughout this study .",
    "one of the main advantage of the determination of galaxies kinematics using integral field spectroscopy at h@xmath0 over long slit spectroscopy is that there is no _ a priori _ knowledge needed on the galaxy apart from its systemic velocity ( which is usually well known within a @xmath2150kms@xmath22range for nearby galaxies , which is enough for accurate observations ) . in long slit spectroscopic observations",
    ", the @xmath10 of the galaxy must be known as the slit must lie on the major axis .",
    "the @xmath10 is thus usually determined by fitting ellipses to the optical isophotes .",
    "as table [ kinematics ] shows , there is sometimes a great discrepancy between published photometrical and kinematical parameters .",
    "the effect can be well illustrated with the nearly face - on ( @xmath28 ) galaxy ngc 3184 .",
    "the photometrical pa of 135@xmath8 is 41@xmath8 off from the kinematical @xmath10 found .",
    "this @xmath10 error can lead to a substantial underestimate of the rotation velocities for highly inclined galaxies . also , for some galaxies , the kinematical center is not superposed on the photometrical center .",
    "this can also lead to large errors on the rotational velocities .",
    "figure [ ngc3184_photo_kine ] shows the effect of using the photometrical @xmath10 to observe this galaxy in long slit spectroscopy .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is less steep in the center of the galaxy and the maximum rotational velocity is underestimated ( rms error is 38.4kms@xmath22 ) , which affects the mass models used to determine the dark matter content . using integral field spectroscopy , the kinematical @xmath10 is determined _ a posteriori _ and it does not affect the quality of the data gathered .",
    "the figure also presents the residuals of the velocity field models built from the rotation curves extracted .",
    "it clearly shows that would the kinematical data have been gathered from long slit observations using the photometrical pa , the results would have been totally erroneous .    on the other hand",
    ", it should be considered that the difference between the photometrical and kinematical pa may be partially due to the fact that the photometrical @xmath10 would have been more accurately determined by using deep ir images ( such as spitzer images ) , which shows the old stellar population and is less affected by structural patterns .     +      barred galaxies lead to a specific problem since errors on the determination of the pa of the disk can be induced by the bar .",
    "for instance , the galaxy is totally dominated by a bar and its associated non - axisymmetric motions . by taking a look at the blue and ir images of figure [ figure_ngc3049 ] ,",
    "it could be thought , at first , that the @xmath10 is somewhere around 20@xmath8 .",
    "however , the isovelocity contours suggest that the @xmath10 is more like 60@xmath8 .",
    "this problem is caused by the lack of kinematical information outside the bar dominated region of the galaxy . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 data would be necessary to resolve the kinematics outside the bar , since the global kinematical parameters must be extracted from the axisymmetric portion of the galaxy .",
    "this galaxy demonstrates clearly the advantage of 2d velocity fields over 1d long - slit data .",
    "2d velocity fields allow to disentangle circular from radial motions while they would be confused in long slit data .",
    "integral field spectroscopy makes it possible to study more thoroughly non circular motions in galaxies , such as in @xcite ( @xcite ) , where an in - depth study of barred galaxies is done .",
    "it has been said that h@xmath0 could not resolve the kinematics for highly inclined galaxies since the gas can not be considered optically thin at this wavelength ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "but , the case of ngc 4236 , whose inclination is 76@xmath8 , shows that as long as the galaxy is not perfectly edge - on , the major axis of the galaxy is visible and the kinematics of the disk can be resolved .",
    "figure [ ngc4236_rc ] shows how the h@xmath0 and @xmath3 kinematics agree . as opposed to the case of",
    ", we can compare the h@xmath0 kinematics to the @xmath3 kinematics since the inner part of the rotation curve is less shallow .",
    "however , since the signal coverage is less extended for h@xmath0 than it is for @xmath3 , the flat part of the rotation curve is missing from the h@xmath0 data . also , as stated by @xcite ( @xcite ) , as spiral galaxies can be considered optically thin at least for the outer part of the visible disk ( @xmath29 ) , h@xmath0 observations can be used to resolve their kinematics .     +",
    "the h@xmath0 kinematics of 28 galaxies of the sings survey were presented in this paper .",
    "the observations were made with ` fantomm ` , an integral field fp spectrometer and a photon counting camera .",
    "the raw data obtained at the telescope were processed through a new pipeline , an adaptive binning algorithm has been applied to achieve optimal signal - to - noise ratio and the radial velocity maps were finally extracted from the data cubes using a selective intensity weighted mean algorithm .",
    "kinematical parameters were computed using a tilted ring model and most of them agreed within an acceptable error range with the photometrical parameters , except for a few problematic galaxies .",
    "it has been shown that high spatial resolution data is essential for mapping the velocity gradient at the centres of galaxies .",
    "the advantages of integral field spectroscopy over long slit spectroscopy were also presented .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide accurate optical kinematical data for the galaxies of the sings survey .",
    "these data will be used in a forthcoming paper to present rotation curves and mass models of the non - barred galaxies ( nicol et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the data of some of the barred galaxies of the sings sample that are also part of the _ ` b``h\\alpha``bar ` _ survey were used to derive the bar pattern speeds using the tremaine ",
    "weinberg method ( @xcite @xcite ) in a paper presented by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "these data might also be used to allow for some of the galactic star formation models to include kinematical data and thus try to determine what is the exact role of rotation in the star formation processes on a galactic scale .",
    "the h@xmath0 kinematical data for all the observable sings galaxies will be made available to the community as soon as all the galaxies have been observed .",
