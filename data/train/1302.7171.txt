    "the interaction of dna nucleobases with inert surfaces has attracted much attention because of its importance for molecular recognition and self - organization processes .",
    "@xcite indeed , a great number of theoretical studies for the adsorption of the four dna nucleobases [ guanine ( g ) , adenine ( a ) , thymine ( t ) , and cytosine ( c ) ] on graphene have been performed to explore the binding mechanism and the relative binding strength of g , a , t , and c.  @xcite these essentially planar base - graphene model systems can simplify the structural complexity of a full three - dimensional dna double - stranded or single - stranded polymer adsorbed on graphene , to provide a possibility for direct experimental characterization of the molecular interactions with graphene . according to previous density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations carried out within the local density approximation ( lda ) ,  @xcite the binding energy of the nucleobases on graphene varies in the following hierarchy : g@xmath1a@xmath4t@xmath4c .",
    "calculations using the more accurate second - order mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) ,  @xcite as well as other calculations utilizing dft methods including van der waals ( vdw ) interactions ,  @xcite obtained binding energy strengths of nucleobases with graphene in the ordering of g@xmath1a@xmath1t@xmath1c , consistent with the single solute adsorption isotherm study at the graphite - water interface .",
    "@xcite the same trend was also confirmed using isothermal titration calorimetry .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the relatively large number of studies involving graphene , there have been relatively few studies concentrating on the interaction of dna with the heterogeneous boron nitride ( bn ) sheet , which has been successfully fabricated through the micromechanical cleavage method  @xcite and the chemical - solution - derived method .",
    "@xcite    the hexagonal bn sheet exhibits the same honeycomb lattice structure as graphene .",
    "however , the electronic properties of the two sheets are drastically different from each other : graphene is a gapless semimetal with the nonpolar nature of the homonuclear c@xmath3c bond , while the bn sheet is an insulator with the polar nature underlying the charge transfer between its constituent b and n atoms .",
    "@xcite it is thus interesting to investigate and compare how such different electronic properties of the bn sheet and graphene affect the binding mechanism and the relative binding strength of the four nucleobases . using lda , lin",
    "_ et al_. showed that the nucleobase molecules are bound to the bn sheet via a polar electrostatic interaction , indicating that the interaction in the base - bn systems is somewhat different from the @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction between the nucleobases and the nonpolar graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite however , calculations based on lda may not be reliable for this base - bn systems , since lda can not correctly describe the long - ranged vdw interactions .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the adsorption of the four dna nucleobases on the bn sheet and graphene , using vdw energy - corrected dft ( dft+vdw scheme  @xcite ) calculations and , for comparison , lda as well as generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) calculations .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find that the binding energy for a given base molecule is very similar on both the bn sheet and graphene .",
    "according to our analysis , it is revealed that despite the large differences in the individual atomic polarizabilities between the bn sheet and graphene , the vdw energy between adsorbed molecule and the bn sheet is nearly equal to the corresponding one in the base - graphene system , resulting in very similar contributions of vdw interactions to the binding energy .",
    "we find that the vdw interactions between base molecule and its substrate determine the sequence of the binding energy as g@xmath1a@xmath1t@xmath1c . here , the contribution of vdw interactions to the binding energy amounts to @xmath01 ev , indicating a strong physisorption .",
    "our electronic - structure analysis shows that this physisorption induces an interfacial dipole between the base molecule and substrate due to charge rearrangement , thereby causing a work - function shift relative to isolated bn sheet or graphene .",
    "the dft+vdw ,  @xcite gga , and lda calculations were performed using the fhi - aims  @xcite code for an accurate , all - electron description based on numeric atom - centered orbitals , with  tight \" computational settings and accurate tier 2 basis sets .",
    "calculations with larger tier 3 basis sets show that our binding energies are converged to within 0.01 ev . for the exchange - correlation energy , we employed the lda functional of ceperley - alder  @xcite and the gga functional of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) .",
    "@xcite the dft+vdw scheme was combined with the pbe functional , since pbe tends to underestimate the binding energy at organic / graphene interfaces .",
    "@xcite in this pbe+vdw scheme , the total energy is composed of the pbe energy ( @xmath5 ) and the vdw energy ( @xmath6 ) which is given by a sum of pairwise interatomic c@xmath7@xmath8 terms : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance between atoms @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the corresponding @xmath14 coefficient , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the vdw radii , and @xmath17 is a damping function eliminating the @xmath18 singularity at small distances . here ,",
    "the @xmath14 coefficients were computed in a first principles way from the pbe ground - state electron density using the recently developed dft+vdw scheme .",
    "@xcite    the present base - substrate systems were modeled in a periodic slab geometry in which base molecules adsorb on one side of the bn sheet or graphene . in order to make the overlap with electronic states from neighboring base molecules negligibly small",
    ", we employed a 5@xmath195 unit cell of the bn sheet ( graphene ) with a vacuum spacing of 60 @xmath20 between adjacent bn ( graphene ) sheets .",
    "the base molecules were terminated at the cut bond to the sugar ring with a methyl group to generate an electronic environment in the nucleobase more closely resembling the environment in an extended dna chain rather than that of just individual isolated bases by themselves and also to introduce a certain degree of steric hindrance when interacting with the substrate .",
    "the @xmath21-space integration was done with a single @xmath22 point in the brillouin zone of the 5@xmath195 unit cell .",
    "all atoms were allowed to relax along the calculated forces until every residual force component amounted to less than 0.02 ev /  .",
    "we begin by describing the equilibrium structures of adsorbed g , a , t , and c on graphene obtained using the lda , pbe , and pbe+vdw schemes . on the basis of previous theoretical calculations ,",
    "@xcite we optimize the ab - stacking - like arrangements of all four nucleobases on graphene . here , we use the optimized lattice constant of graphene as 2.445 , 2.467 , and 2.465  ( see table i ) for lda , pbe , and pbe+vdw , respectively .",
    "the optimized ab - stacking - like structures for adsorbed g , a , t , and c on graphene are very similar to the corresponding ones on the bn sheet ( see fig .",
    "table ii lists the vertical distance between the base molecule and graphene sheet , obtained using lda , pbe , and pbe+vdw .",
    "we find that lda , pbe , and pbe+vdw give the values of the vertical distance ranging 3.08@xmath03.17  , 3.95@xmath04.02  , and 3.26@xmath03.29  , respectively .",
    "thus , the pbe+vdw values of the vertical distance are seen to fall between the lda and pbe ones .",
    ". optimized lattice constant ( in  ) of the bn and graphene sheets obtained using lda , pbe , and pbe+vdw , in comparison with previous theoretical results . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the adsorption of the four dna nucleobases on the bn sheet and on graphene , using the lda , pbe , and pbe+vdw schemes .",
    "the calculated binding energies of the four nucleobases on the two different substrates were predicted in the order of pbe+vdw @xmath1 lda @xmath1 pbe .",
    "we found that the vdw interactions between each base molecule and the two sheets are very close to each other , giving rise to similar binding energies in the base - bn and base - graphene systems . here , the magnitudes of the vdw interactions range from 0.9 to 1.2 ev , indicating a strong physisorption .",
    "we also found that the variation of vdw interactions depending on the base molecules determines the sequence of the binding energy as g@xmath1a@xmath1t@xmath1c , following the hierarchy of polarizabilities of the four dna nucleobases .",
    "our analysis shows that this physisorption induces an interfacial dipole between the base molecule and the substrate , leading to a small change in the work function relative to isolated graphene and bn sheets",
