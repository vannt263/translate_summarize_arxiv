    "figures  [ fig : magnetization_sf_q ] and [ fig : magnetization_ws_q ] confirm that , qualitatively speaking , the behavior of the q - voter model is not affected by the particular value of @xmath14 , both for the scale - free and the watts - strogatz networks .",

    "<S> the q - voter model , a variant of the classic voter model , has been analyzed by several authors : while allowing to study opinion dynamics , this model is also believed to be one of the most representative among the many defined in the wide field of sociophysics . here , we investigate the consequences of conformity on the consensus reaching process , by numerically simulating a q - voter model with agents behaving either as conformists or non - conformists , embedded on heterogeneous network topologies ( as small - world and scale - free ) . in fact , although it is already known that conformity enhances the reaching of consensus , the related process is often studied only on fully - connected networks , thus strongly limiting our full understanding of it . </S>",
    "<S> this paper represents a first step in the direction of analyzing more realistic social models , showing that different opinion formation - phases , driven by the conformist agents density , are observable . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we identify threshold values of the density of conformist agents , varying across different topologies and separating different regimes of our system , ranging from a disordered phase , where different opinions coexist , to a gradually more ordered phase , where consensus is eventually reached .    </S>",
    "<S> recent years have witnessed the increasing interest of scientists belonging to different fields , as physics , mathematics and computer science , for socio - economic systems  @xcite . in particular , it has become evident that several models born within the realm of statistical physics can be successfully employed for understanding simplified social systems , thus gaining insight in the human behavior  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the influence of conformity ( considered a fundamental social trait ) on opinion dynamics has been extensively studied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although conformity is of great interest in social sciences , e.g. in social psychology  @xcite , several authors have analyzed it by adopting the viewpoint of statistical mechanics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> just to cite a few , in  @xcite authors analyzed the role of contrarians ( i.e. agents acting as non - conformists ) in voting dynamics and in  @xcite authors analyzed how conformity affects opinion dynamics by implementing the local majority rule .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we approach the problem of understanding how conformity affects opinion dynamics by implementing the q - voter model  @xcite , i.e. a variant of the classic voter model  @xcite , on heterogeneous networks . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , while it is already known that conformity enhances the reaching of consensus ( i.e. an opinion shared by _ all _ agents )  @xcite the details of this process are still questioned  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , systems like the voter model and the q - voter model are often simulated over fully connected networks  @xcite , and only to a lesser extent on more complex topologies ( see for instance  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the one hand , this allows to analytically model the system under the mean - field approximation , on the other strongly limits the validity of results to unrealistic scenarios as it has been proven that social systems show highly heterogeneous structures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our analysis aims at exploring the behavior of the q - voter model by considering more realistic network topologies in order to understand the extent to which @xmath0 varying the amount of conformist agents and @xmath1 varying the network structure affects the consensus reaching process . in order to do so , we heavily rest upon numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> results of our simulations indicate the presence of different opinion - formation regimes , driven by the density of conformist agents and varying across different network configurations . </S>",
    "<S> threshold values separating different regimes vary as well . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the system seems to undergo a spontaneous symmetry - breaking , by ( stochastically ) choosing states with the same `` net '' opinion but opposite signs . in order to study the role of conformity in the q - voter model , we defined a simple agent - based model by considering @xmath2 agents , provided with an opinion and a social character .    </S>",
    "<S> opinions are mapped to the agents states @xmath3 and are assigned to each agent of the population stochastically , i.e. according to the probability coefficients @xmath4 ; thus , our initial expected number of opinions @xmath5 is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , agents are provided with an individual behavior , i.e. either conformist or non - conformist . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we will adopt the definition according to which a conformist agent adopts the opinion of the majority of its neighbors , whereas a non - conformist one adopts the opposite . </S>",
    "<S> as for the opinion , the behavior is assigned stochastically too , according to the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. the probability to behave as a conformist or a non - conformist , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as before , the initial expected number of conformist agents is @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> . the two processes of assigning opinions and behaviors are independent : so , each agent s initial probability of being both conformist and having opinion @xmath5 is @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> . we will consider agents interacting on different configurations : while the probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath12 will remain fixed , @xmath7 and @xmath13 will vary , in order to achieve different densities of conformist ( and non - conformist ) agents in the population . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , opinions vary as a result of the system dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the q - voter model extends the classic voter model , letting each agent adopt the opinion shared by a subset of neighbors of arbitrary dimension  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model is described by two parameters : @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the former represents the number of neighbors each agent has to consider to have its opinion defined , whereas the latter represents the probability for each agent to change its state anyway , even if not all the @xmath14 chosen neighbors agree . </S>",
    "<S> we implement the q - voter model setting @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see appendix * b * for different choices of @xmath14 ) . therefore , agents choose @xmath16 neighbors at random : if they all share the same opinion , a conformist agent adopts it , whereas a non - conformist agent adopts the opposite one . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the agent keeps its precedent opinion : in fact , setting @xmath17 means setting to zero the probability of changing opinion stocastichally , in the event the @xmath14 neighbors disagree .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that the implemented updating rule has been chosen to be synchronous ; this means that every agent updates its state simultaneously , on the basis of neighbors opinion at the previous time step . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we believe asynchronous updating does not adequately capture the real dynamics of a social experiment . for instance , let us imagine many people forming groups to discuss about politics : it is hard to imagine participants discussing and changing their opinion `` sequentially '' . persons interacts with their neighbors simultaneously , updating their opinion in `` real time '' , i.e. _ before _ being engaged in a new discussion with a different group . another example is provided by voting scenarios , where people express their opinion at the same time . moreover , even if asynchronous updating were applicable , it would cause the system dynamics to be dependent on the particular sequence of agents chosen .     and different configurations : * a * regular lattice ; * b * small - world network ( @xmath18 ) ; * c * small - world network ( @xmath19 ) ; * d * scale - free network . </S>",
    "<S> small pictorial representations are shown for each network.[fig : magnetization],scaledwidth=39.5% ]         numerical simulations of our model have been carried on by chosing @xmath20 agents , embedded on different network topologies as scale - free networks , regular lattices , small world networks and completely random networks . while scale - free networks have been generated via the barabasi - albert model  @xcite , the last three kinds of networks have been generated via the watts - strogatz model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter allows to obtain different network configurations by varying the value of the rewiring probability @xmath21 : regular lattices are achieved by setting @xmath22 , small - world networks by setting @xmath23 and completely random networks by setting @xmath24 . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the following values : @xmath25 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all the considered networks have an average degree equal to @xmath26 ( i.e. agents have , on average , eight neighbors ) . </S>",
    "<S> each simulation has been performed with a different amount of conformist agents , @xmath27 $ ] , and it has been run for @xmath28 time steps . </S>",
    "<S> for the vast majority of cases this temporal limit was long enough to reach a steady - state , as only few network configurations required more time . however , in the latter scenarios ( e.g. regular lattices ) we performed longer simulations ( see appendix * a * ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the evolution of the system magnetization over time , i.e. the absolute value of the difference between the number of agents in the two states  @xcite , normalized to @xmath2 : @xmath29    the magnetization ranges between 0 and 1 ( @xmath30 ) , with @xmath31 indicating the equipartition of the two opinions ( i.e. the maximally disordered phase ) , and @xmath32 indicating that consensus has been reached . </S>",
    "<S> notice that both situations @xmath33 and , vice - versa , @xmath34 are compatible with consensus , i.e. magnetization is uninformative about the dominant opinion sign .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : magnetization ] illustrates the evolution of the magnetization , upon varying the value of @xmath35 for different network configurations . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the density of conformist agents strongly affects the process of consensus reaching ; more detailedly , @xmath0 values of @xmath36 seem not to be sufficiently high to let the system escape the disordered phase where the two opinions coexist ; @xmath1 values of @xmath37 let the system escape the disordered phase but not to reach consensus : a steady - state is reached where one of the two opinions prevails on the other ; @xmath38 only the density value @xmath39 allows the system to reach the consensus .        </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this is valid for all the considered configurations : what changes is the number of time steps after which the steady - state , or the consensus , is reached . in particular , the regular lattice ( panel a of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] ) is the configuration where the process is slowest ( see appendix * a * for further details ) . as the network is more and more rewired ( panels b and c of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] ) , the process becomes faster . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , further rewiring the network ( @xmath40 ) does not lead to any appreciable change . qualitatively speaking </S>",
    "<S> , the scale - free configuration ( panel d of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] ) does not show significant differences with respect to the small - world network with @xmath41 ; however , the latter reaches the steady - state later , for all the values of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> it is maybe surprising that the presence of hubs does not speed up the process . </S>",
    "<S> however , this apparent paradox could be explained by considering that we are implementing a q - voter model , with an update rule involving only four neighbors at a time : thus , the ( potential ) influence that hubs could have on large numbers of nodes is drastically reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> notice also that , for any given configuration , rising @xmath35 shortens the time for reaching the steady - state .    </S>",
    "<S> according to figure  [ fig : magnetization ] the value @xmath42 seems to play the role of a threshold , separating two phases of the system : the disordered one , characterized by @xmath43 , and the ordered one , with @xmath44 gradually rising ( as a function of @xmath35 ) until full consensus is reached . as we will show in a while , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the q - voter model on heterogeneous networks is far richer .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : phase ] shows the value of the magnetization at the steady - state ( i.e. after @xmath28 time steps ) , for two network configurations only ( but the same holds true for all the others ) , as a function of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> let us focus on the scale - free configuration ( left panel of figure  [ fig : phase ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> at a first sight , two distinct phases are visible : the disordered one , characterized by @xmath43 for all the values of @xmath36 , and the ordered one , characterized by a value @xmath45 for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the magnetization seems to play the role of the order parameter of a continuous phase transition , while @xmath35 plays the role of control parameter , which can be varied to change the system behavior smoothly . </S>",
    "<S> actually , a closer inspection reveals three different opinion - formation regimes ( indicated by different colors ) , with two distinct threshold values : @xmath47 separating the flat behavior ( in black ) from the slowly - rising linear one ( in red ) and @xmath48 separating the latter from the rapidly - rising linear one ( in green ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insets ( zooming on the second transition ) reveal that the same qualitative behavior can be observed also for networks with a lower number of agents ; what changes is the trend followed by points in the third phase ( linear for @xmath49 and quadratic for @xmath50 ) with @xmath51 shifting towards lower values ( @xmath52 for @xmath53 agents ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now comment our findings for the watts - strogatz configuration ( right panel of figure  [ fig : phase ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this time four phases are distinguishable , separated by three threshold values : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the insets reveal , the system loses two of the phases as the number of agents is lowered , showing three linear regimes for @xmath49 and only one quadratic regime for @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the analysis of @xmath44 is somehow limiting because the values of @xmath44 can not be negative : this means that the situations where agents reach consensus by adopting the opinions @xmath5 and @xmath57 are indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need a quantity able to distinguish the sign of the system final state . to achieve this </S>",
    "<S> , we use the _ summation of states _ @xmath58 providing a complementary information with respect to @xmath44 . plotting the summation @xmath59 versus the density of conformists , it is possible to achieve further information on the system dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure  [ fig : bifurcation ] , as the density of conformists rises the system chooses one of two states , characterized by the same absolute value of @xmath59 , but with opposite sign : remarkably , the two states revealed by crossing the thresholds are symmetrically distributed with respect to the horizontal axis . in other words , by rising the density @xmath35 the system is induced to choose one out of two possible states , a priori equally probable , thus breaking its symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> each point of the phase diagram is the result of an average over @xmath60 simulations : the obtained values show very small numerical differences , amounting to few percents in the vast majority of cases . when considering the summation of states , to not wash away the information provided by the sign of s , </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry - breaking diagram has been obtained by averaging the negative and the positive values separately , maintaining the bi - stable character of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the q - voter model shows a very rich behavior , even simply considering agents with two opinions and two characters only , as conformists and non - conformists . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the density of conformist agents @xmath35 strongly affects the consensus reaching process , defining threshold values separating different phases of opinion formation . for @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> the two original opinions equally coexist , i.e. 50% of agents remain in the @xmath5 state and 50% of agents remain in the @xmath57 state ( with small fluctuations ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , by progressively rising @xmath35 , the system starts showing a magnetization , i.e. a larger number of agents starts sharing the same opinion . </S>",
    "<S> this process can be broken down in several phases , suggesting different functional forms of @xmath62 , separated by different values of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the system crosses the thresholds undergoing a sort of continuous phase transition , as signalled by the magnetization value .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from the details of the process , the response of the q - voter model to changes of the conformist agent density is remarkably stable across different network topologies : watts - strogatz networks with @xmath63 show similar phase - diagrams and symmetry - breaking processes , in turn very similar to the ones observed for the scale - free configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of considering heterogeneous topologies is mainly reflected in the speed of the process , which depends on the values of the parameter @xmath21 : in particular , the more random the network , the faster the process .    in words , what emerges indicates that different regimes of `` opinion growth '' are identifiable , strongly affected by the density of conformists . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even if the percentage of conformists drives the society towards a `` prevalent '' opinion ( whose diffusion speed grows as more and more conformists are considered ) in the case of agents with only two opinions ( evenly distributed at @xmath64 ) , the prevalent one can not be predicted _ a priori_. the achieved results open the way to further analyses , as considering agents with more opinions , more and different social traits and other network configurations .     on the regular ring for @xmath16 , up to @xmath65 time steps.[fig : long_simulation],scaledwidth=49.0% ] </S>"
