    "the credit crisis and panic that erupted in 2008 in the us and spilled over the world have made again clear that financial price and economic value are based fundamentally on trust ; not on fancy mathematical formulas , not on subtle self - consistent efficient economic equilibrium ; but on trust in the future , trust in economic growth , trust in the ability of debtors to face their liabilities , trust in financial institutions to play their role as multipliers of economic growth , trust that our money in a bank account can be redeemed at any time we choose .",
    "usually , we take these facts for granted . when depositors happen to doubt banks , this leads to devastating bank runs .",
    "when banks start to doubt other banks , this leads to a freeze of the inter - banking loan markets and an effective run on collaterised assets .",
    "then , the implicit processes of a working economy all we take for granted starts to dysfunction and spirals into a global collapse , as almost happened with the lehmann brothers bankruptcy .",
    "the standard discourse by observers and pundits is to attribute the 2008 crisis to the mortgage - backed securities linked to the bursting of the house price bubble , the irresponsible lending , overly complex financial instruments and conflicts of interest leading to asymmetric information translated into market illiquidity , and the spreading of risks via packaging and selling of imagined valuations to unsuspecting investors .",
    "what is missing in this discussion is to endogenise trust in the dynamics of the credit system .    as a contribution to fill this gap",
    ", we construct a simple macroeconomic model , based on basic accounting rules combined with reasonable economic assumptions , which put trust as the central dynamical variable . focusing on credit creation and its dynamics ,",
    "we naturally use asset amount and leverage ( here defined as the ratio debt to asset ) as the two other variables . to operationalise the model , we define trust as the maximum sustainable leverage .",
    "this transforms an a priori ill - defined qualitative concept , capturing the degree of belief in the reliability , truth , or ability of something , into a quantitative variable that can be worked with .",
    "our motivation to focus on the three variables ( i ) assets , ( ii ) leverage and ( iii ) trust is that these are three key economic variables for studying different economic regimes , since they relate to credit , which has a central role in economics as a driver of economic cycles .",
    "for example , credit is pivotal to understand the financial crisis of 2008 .",
    "ahead of the 2008 crisis , credit was easily available : a high percentage of asset value could be used as collateral to obtain a loan .",
    "the high availability of credit caused debt levels and leverage to increase rapidly . at a certain moment , this drastically changed and credit crunched : the financial crisis of 2008 was a fact . to exemplify the importance of credit today : the current global public debt is over 57 trillion u.s .",
    "dollar @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the gross world product ( gwp ) is about 78 trillion u.s .",
    "dollar @xcite . for the united states ,",
    "the public debt as a percentage of gdp is over 90% at the time of writing .",
    "the central role of credit ( debt ) in an economy suggests to focus on the modelling the interplay between assets ( assets serve as a collateral to obtain a loan ) , leverage ( the debt to assets value ) and trust ( the maximum sustainable leverage ) .    the link between credit and the afore - mentioned variables has been qualitatively discussed by @xcite , who provided a qualitative framework in which credit creation is argued to depend on the amount of collateral assets accepted , the level of leverage and the level of trust and confidence in future cash flows . in their paper ,",
    "a qualitative theory was proposed to understand credit creation and the perspectives of different schools of thought were integrated ( austrian , mainstream and post keynesian ) .",
    "besides the paper of @xcite , there are numerous other papers in which assets , leverage and trust are ( mostly separately ) studied .",
    "@xcite presents a model in which the interplay of leverage and assets is captured . in this model",
    ", a set - up is used in which houses are used as collateral for long - term loans , and loans are used as collateral for repos .",
    "based on this framework , @xcite advocates that leverage rates should be the primary target ( instead of interest rates ) of central banks in times of crisis .",
    "_ asset _ prices are a central theme in , for example , the research of @xcite .",
    "their paper studies whether central banks should respond to movements in asset prices . @xcite linked price changes of assets to financial instability : sustained rapid credit growth combined with large increases in asset prices tends to increase the probability of financial instability .",
    "based on historical data , the research showed that significant changes in asset prices are linked to increased financial instability .",
    "it is argued that monetary policy should respond to changing asset prices with the goal of preserving financial stability .",
    "@xcite present a study in which _ leverage _ is the main variable that is studied and it is demonstrated that an inverse relation between leverage and future growth of firms with a low q - ratio exists .",
    "leverage as an indicator for growth opportunities is also a theme in a study of @xcite , who hypothesizes that high leverage economies are particularly vulnerable to slowdowns in the world economy .",
    "@xcite initiated the study of _ trust _ ( `` social capital '' ) and its relation to the well - functioning of a society by providing case studies of the functioning of regional governments in italy . @xcite have investigated trust and its impact on the economy .",
    "survey data was used to capture trust and it was found that `` social capital '' ( indicated by trust ) matters for economic performance . @xcite confirm this finding based on data from u.s .",
    "states in which a positive relation between trust and economic growth was found . in a study of @xcite",
    ", it has been investigated through what mechanisms trust affects economic growth and trust is proposed to be the fundamental driver of economic development .",
    "there is no full consensus on the relation between trust and economic growth .",
    "@xcite could not verify the link between trust and economic growth and they concluded that there may not always be an economic pay - off of trust .",
    "hence , there exists no consensus on a relation between trust and economic performance and one should keep in mind that the definition of trust may differ in various papers .    in order to position our model ,",
    "it is useful to provide a short overview of influential macroeconomic models in the academic and central banking literature .",
    "this overview is useful to to position our assets , leverage and trust model .",
    "the new - keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium ( dsge ) model is one of the most influential models in the academic and central banking community ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview of dsge models and see @xcite for an overview of dsge models and beyond ) . the model is built around three coupled equations , which derive from micro - foundations : supply , demand and monetary policy equations .",
    "furthermore , equations describing expectations can be explicitly taken into account in the dsge framework .",
    "a strong element of the model is that it can capture the response of output and inflation to demand , supply and policy shocks .",
    "dsge models however failed to explain the significant rapid changes ( declines ) in asset prices , output and investment that occurred during the 2008 crisis and thereafter @xcite .",
    "as a response to this inability to model the 2008 crisis , a strand of the recent literature focussed on introducing dynamics to account for the possible occurrence of extreme events that abruptly and significantly influence economic quantities such as asset prices , output or investment .",
    "examples of influential recent papers that focus on this are those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the new models employ continuous time modelling approaches to macroeconomic problems and assume market incompleteness ( i.e. not all risks can be hedged ) .",
    "this approach is mathematically convenient as it allows one to characterise the possible economic states by ( partial ) differential equations .",
    "a characteristic of the new class of models is that , in the limit of small ( zero ) disturbances / volatility , the non - linear dynamics of the model reduces to a linearised dsge model .",
    "variants of the afore - mentioned models , as well as the model constructed in this research , can eventually be used to assess policy measures of central banks .",
    "@xcite focus on the question whether monetary policy can help to avert self - fulfilling debt crises and at what cost ( particularly in terms of inflation ) .",
    "their paper builds on earlier sovereign debt crisis models and extends these with the goal of quantifying the afore - mentioned cost .",
    "a model on which it builds is that of @xcite who introduced a real sovereign debt crisis model ( without a monetary authority ) , in which a government defaults at a predetermined time @xmath2 if the present value of debt exceeds the present value of future primary surpluses ( i.e. government spending , excluding interest payments , minus income from taxes ) . @xcite extend the model to a monetary economy , which provides a convenient framework to study conventional monetary policies ( in particular the effects of inflation and interest rate ) .",
    "furthermore , it allows to study additional ( non conventional ) monetary tools , such as buying government bonds by considering the budget constraint of a central bank .",
    "@xcite assess the conventional monetary policies ( operating through interest rates ) using a new keynesian dsge model based on @xcite with extensions by @xcite to introduce a delay in the impact of monetary policy shocks .",
    "@xcite conclude that the conventional tools of the central bank , aimed at averting a debt crisis , lead to high inflation for a sustained period of time .",
    "unconventional monetary policies ( e.g. quantitative easing : the purchase of government securities or other securities from the market ) are suggested to be effective only when an economy is at the zero lower bound ( zlb ) , i.e. when the short - term interest rate is at 0 .",
    "the organisation of the present article is as following .",
    "section [ sec : formalisation_dynamics ] gives the formal definition of our three fundamental variables as well as a number of derived quantities .",
    "it then states the three governing ordinary differential equations , whose derivation is presented in appendix [ app : derivation_dynamcis ] and some closed - formed solutions are given .",
    "the fixed point stability analysis is also presented .",
    "section [ sec : results_fulldynamics ] presents a survey of the main properties of the model , by showing phase portraits of the trajectories in the leverage - trust space and by quantifying the associated return on asset .",
    "section [ sec : leverage_trust_regime_shifts ] uses the model to investigate what happens under regime shifts , either due to some exogenous adverse shock leading to a sustained crisis ( negative growth rate ) and/or as a result of policy intervention in the form of decreased target interest rates and increased return on assets .",
    "section [ sec : bayesian ] presents the calibration of the model , extended using a markov switching framework for an exogenous model parameter , to the return on equity of the euro stoxx 50 for the time period 2000 - 2013 .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes . the derivations and proofs of the main results are presented in appendices [ leverage_trust_appendix ] and [ app_proof_theorem ]",
    "the following definitions clarify the meaning of our three key economic variables and introduce their growth rates .",
    "+    the total asset value at time @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "asset value can always be written as the sum of debt and equity :    a(t ) : = d(t)+ e(t ) , [ assets_sum_debt_equity ]    where @xmath5 is the debt at time @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the equity at time @xmath3 .",
    "[ def_assets_sum ]    the leverage at time @xmath3 , denoted @xmath7 , is defined here as : @xmath8    banks usually operate with leverage ratios close to 1 , while `` normal firms '' usually operate with lower leverage ratios .",
    "the leverage is an interesting quantity to examine since it quantifies the indebtedness of an economy and is linked to risk and volatility . as a side note ,",
    "the standard way of defining leverage is @xmath9 . for this study ,",
    "the definition given by eq.leverage_def is more convenient to link to the trust variable to be defined formally in definition [ constraint_for_debt ] .",
    "@xmath10 in eq.leverage_def is related to @xmath11 through @xmath12 .",
    "while @xmath11 has no limit in principle , @xmath10 has an upper limit of one , corresponding to the limit of zero equity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the trust @xmath14 is defined as the fraction of the total assets that qualifies as collateral for taking on debt .",
    "the trust can hence be viewed to represent a borrower s creditworthiness . it is assumed that under normal circumstances the level of trust @xmath14 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath15 this inequality expresses that in general the debt @xmath16 should not exceed the total value of acceptable collateral .",
    "this holds simply by definition of what is meant by `` acceptable collateral '' and derives from the nature of lending where the lender hedges his risks by ensuring that the borrower has assets at least as large as the borrowed amount .",
    "we should note that periods of market exuberance have been characterised by a failure of this inequality , as for instance for subprime `` ninja loans '' ( loans extended to people with  no income , no job , ( and ) no assets ) .    in this study",
    ", the return on assets ( roa ) , defined by @xmath17 is viewed as a proxy for economic growth .",
    "we will also use the growth rate @xmath18 of debt , the return @xmath19 on equity ( roe ) and the growth rate @xmath20 of leverage .    from differentiation of @xmath21 ( eq.leverage_def ) with respect to @xmath3 , the growth rate @xmath22 of leverage , the growth rate @xmath23 of debt and the return @xmath24 on assets are linked by the simple relation @xmath25      we now derive the coupled dynamics of assets , leverage and trust .",
    "before presenting the fundamental equations for assets , debt and trust , it is necessary to introduce additional definitions .",
    "depreciations @xmath26 ( over a period @xmath27 ) are given by :    _ t ( t ) = _ t a(t ) ,    where @xmath28 is a depreciation factor , indicating what fraction of asset value is `` lost '' over a time period of @xmath27 .",
    "amortization @xmath29 ( over a period @xmath27 ) is given by :    _ ( t)= d(t - t)-d(t ) ,    where @xmath30 if the debt decreases ( the word derives from `` amortisen '' , which means `` to kill '' : decrease debt in this case ) .",
    "note that @xmath31 if more debt is taken on .",
    "the definition of net income ( ni ) , also referred to as net earnings , @xmath32 follows from accounting :    _ t ( t ) = _ - _ , [ earnings ]    in which @xmath33 is defined as the ebitda to assets ratio .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 is the interest rate paid on debt .",
    "the subscripts @xmath27 refers to a period @xmath27 ( so e.g. @xmath35 are the net earnings generated over a time period @xmath27 ) . note that taxes are neglected in the model ( in case of taxes , these should be subtracted from ebit as well in eq.earnings ; such that ni = ebit - interest - taxes )    furthermore",

    "eq.assets1 is the the governing equation for assets .      to construct a fundamental equation for trust",
    ", we firstly assume that in the absence of externalities ( that might cause abrupt changes in the trust ) the trust increases to its maximum value @xmath47 , where all assets qualify as collateral . a tendency for trust to increase",
    "is thus assumed .",
    "this assumption can be supported by both a psychological and a rational phenomenon .",
    "the psychological phenomenon is the prosociality of humans : people have a tendency of helping , benefiting and trusting others and/or society @xcite .",
    "the rational phenomenon is the aim to use all assets and let the economy function at its `` full potential '' . in an economy that functions to its full potential ,",
    "the trust is at its maximum .",
    "this is favourable because the higher the trust , the more credit there can be to fund profitable projects ( if trust is 1 , 100% of the asset value is accepted as a collateral to obtain a loan ) .",
    "a convenient and common function to capture the growth of the trust to its maximum 1 , is the logistic function ( `` s - curve '' ) .",
    "it was first introduced by pierre verhulst in the nineteenth century to describe population growth , but it has a wide range of applications in many fields .",
    "for example , it has applications in statistical physics ( fermi - dirac ) , demography , and to model the dynamics of the market penetration of a product or service",
    ". a standard logistic equation for trust would thus be : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the inertia ( resistance ) of the trust to change .",
    "eq.trust_equation2 captures the standard features of a logistic equation . for low @xmath2",
    ", eq.trust_equation2 simplifies to @xmath50 , which expresses that the growth rate of trust is proportional to the existing trust .",
    "this type of accumulation of trust is named the matthew effect @xcite . in this context",
    "it follows that , the higher the level of existing trust , the faster trust grows ( `` cumulative advantage '' ) . for @xmath2 close to 1 ( large @xmath2 ) , eq.trust_equation2 simplifies to @xmath51 , which shows that the rate of change of trust ( @xmath52 ) decreases when @xmath2 approaches 1 .",
    "note that when @xmath53 or @xmath54 then a steady - state is reached ( @xmath55 in eq.trust_equation2 ) .",
    "it is desired that the growth of trust is positive when trust exceeds leverage , while it should be negative when leverage exceeds trust . in this way",
    ", a convergence to the `` natural optimum '' @xmath56 is imposed . by adding a multiplication of @xmath57 to eq.trust_equation2 ,",
    "this feature is captured .",
    "the following `` extended '' logistic equation is hence postulated for the trust :    = k ( t - l ) t(1-t ) .",
    "[ trust_equation ]    another way to justify the term @xmath57 is to argue that the growth rate @xmath58 of trust should be modulated by @xmath57 , being positive if @xmath59 and negative if @xmath60 .",
    "a first order taylor expansion then yields the form leading to expression ( [ trust_equation ] ) .",
    "the `` extended '' logistic equation ( eq.trust_equation ) is more complex than the standard logistic equation ( eq.trust_equation2 ) because a constant trust ( steady - state ) can be reached when either @xmath61 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 which ever occurs first . given that we start from an initial condition @xmath62 , this means that if @xmath10 `` catches up '' with @xmath2 before @xmath53 , a stationary condition is reached where @xmath63 .      based on the assumption of a tendency for economies to increase debt levels , as argued by e.g. @xcite and empirically supported by @xcite , a debt dynamics will be proposed in this subsection .",
    "we assume a tendency for economies to reach its maximal debt , while taking into account eq.constraint_for_debt .",
    "this implies , in mathematical terms , that @xmath64 should be imposed to be a natural fixed point .",
    "then , the next point of reasoning is that a non - instantaneous convergence of @xmath65 is assumed .",
    "there exists inertia for @xmath16 to reach @xmath66 because it takes time to find investment opportunities and it only makes sense to increase debt when such opportunities exist .",
    "this can be supported by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite discusses that there are occurrences in history where the capital mobility ( moving funds internationally ) was found to be low .",
    "@xcite discuss leverage ratios with slow average speeds of adjustment to target level .",
    "the governing equations for the debt is postulated to be :    & = -a ( d - ta ) , [ debt_dv ] + & = a ( ta- d)+ , [ debt1 ]    where @xmath67 captures the inertia of debt convergence to its optimal value .",
    "note that eq.debt1 is valid for @xmath68 and @xmath69 : in both cases there is a tendency for @xmath70 .",
    "as previously mentioned , eq.debt1 is constructed such that @xmath16 tends to converge to @xmath66 .",
    "this convergence of @xmath16 to @xmath66 would already be ensured without the term @xmath71 in eq.debt1 , however this term can boost or slow down the change in @xmath16 , depending on the rate of change ( trend ) in @xmath66 .",
    "the proposed debt equation ( eq.debt1 ) assumes that this trend of @xmath66 is known and incorporates this .",
    "we assume that economic agents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of assets .",
    "in this section , we outline how the final differential equations for assets , leverage , trust can be obtained .",

    "the strong increase in trust is the most notable difference observed when comparing fig.sf:medium_path and [ sf : early_path ] and it plays a crucial role to attain the highest steady - state return on assets .",

    "intervening when trust is high ensures convergence towards a fixed point @xmath119 that is high on the diagonal and this translates ( for @xmath144 ) into a high stationary roa .    from a dynamical system point of view , that trust increases when @xmath89 drops ( representing a crisis ) results from the fact that @xmath79 is `` pushed '' inside the domain @xmath123 $ ] and the trajectories `` bend '' towards the attractive fixed point @xmath140 , which simultaneously means that trust grows .",
    "structurally , the increase in trust results from our assumption in the fundamental trust eq.trust_equation that trust increases when @xmath59 ( and decreases when @xmath60 ) . in other words , we have engineered an economy in which there is an innate propensity for trust to develop up to its maximum , allowing in turn leverage to grow so that the economy can attain its full potential of maximum growth .",
    "one could think that there are regimes in which leverage @xmath10 could grow faster than @xmath2 , overtake it , which would then lead to a subsequent decrease in trust .",
    "however , in the present formulation of our model , this is forbidden by the `` barrier '' at @xmath56 ( the fixed axis ) that can not be crossed by any trajectory .",
    "this property comes from the assumption underlying eq.debt_dv in appendix a that the difference between debt and its maximum available amount tends to relax exponentially fast with rate @xmath145 .",
    "thus , if at some time , trust is larger than leverage , it can only increase and remain in this region @xmath146 at all times .",
    "the above results thus suggest that the optimal policy intervention strategy is to accept the economic downturn for some time , thereby allowing trust to increase and leverage to decrease somewhat , and then to intervene relatively late by boosting @xmath89 and lowering interest rates @xmath87",
    ".    one may question whether it makes sense that an economy in crisis can increase trust in the absence of intervention .",
    "an increasing trust implies that the maximum sustainable leverage increases . with the lower utilisation of means of production",

    "but the psychology of economic agents in general dominates , with strong risk aversion developing during crisis , leading to freezing of capital and under utilisation of resources .",

    "the phenomenon that late intervention is most effective to attain a high long - term return on assets can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows trust to increase first , and it is most effective to intervene when trust is high .",

    "the leverage / trust trajectories can be solved analytically ( closed - form ) based on eq.l_tau and .",
    "we will outline the derivation and provide the result .",
    "the first step in deriving the closed form solution is to divide eq.l_tau by eq.t_tau : @xmath178    in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , eq.dldt is given by :    & = ( + t(1-l ) ) , [ dldt_beta ] + & = + ( 1-l ) .",
    "( 0 , ) [ dldt_beta2 ]    eq.dldt_beta2 is a first order linear differential equation .",
    "solving eq.dldt_beta2 yields : @xmath95 \\notag \\\\   & \\;\\;\\;+ \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta }   \\frac{t^2 } { ( 1-t ) }   \\int_0 ^ 1{(1-y)^{\\beta+1 } } { { \\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{\\beta t}{1-t } y } { \\mathrm{d}}y } \\bigg\\ } ,     \\label{lt_final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is an integration constant .",
    "the fixed ( stationary ) points are the set @xmath179 for which @xmath180 and @xmath181 . from eq.t_tau and eq.l_tau_2 ( which are valid for @xmath182 ) , it follows that the axis @xmath56 and the point @xmath99 satisfy this condition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath183 is a fixed point . to show this , consider , , in non - dimensional time for @xmath47 : @xmath184 so : @xmath181 ( as required to classify as fixed point ) and one can substitute the first equation of system into the second to find under what condition a solution is admitted :        now in order to be able to analyse the stability of the fixed points , define @xmath186 and @xmath187 . furthermore , assume that @xmath101 is an arbitrary fixed point . now",
    "the linear system for @xmath179 close to @xmath101 can be represented by a taylor expansion around the fixed point :            the jacobian matrix @xmath190 in its most general variant is given by : @xmath191 = \\left [   \\begin{matrix } \\partial_t \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}t}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau } & \\partial_l \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}t}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau } \\\\",

    "if both eigenvalues are negative , then the axis @xmath56 is attractive / stable , while the axis is repulsive / unstable when at least one of the eigenvalues is positive . from @xmath199 , it then follows that ( assuming @xmath200 $ ] and @xmath201 ) : @xmath202 note that the above implies that , if @xmath106 ( then : @xmath107 ) , the axis @xmath56 will be entirely attractive for @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "+ * roa *        from eq.re_eq_ra_tl , it follows that on the axis @xmath56 the return on equity and the return on assets are equal .",
    "this result @xmath203 on @xmath56 economically are intuitive .",
    "the axis @xmath56 is a steady - state axis and thus describes long - run behaviour .",
    "hence the result can be interpreted as that in the long - run the return on financial investments ( i.e. the return on equity ) should equal the growth of the economy ( return on assets ) .",
    "this is in line with the reasoning by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath10 can be easily computed .",
    "the derivative of eq.t_equals_l_return with respect to @xmath10 indicates whether @xmath204 increases , decreases or stays constant for increasing @xmath10 .",
    "taking the derivative with respect to @xmath10 of eq.t_equals_l_return gives :      which expresses that : if @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) then : @xmath204 increases ( decreases ) when @xmath10 increases .",
    "when @xmath207 then @xmath204 is constant with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "note that the trajectories can never move on the axis @xmath56 ( since points on the axis @xmath56 are in steady - state ) ; however the result is useful to compare the different steady - state points on the axis @xmath56 .        the jacobian matrix ( eq.final_jacobian ) evaluated at @xmath209 , @xmath210 is given by : @xmath211,\\ ] ] with eigenvalues @xmath212 , and @xmath213 .",
    "the eigenvalues are of opposite sign .",
    "hence , the stationary point is a saddle point , which is unstable .                in order to investigate the stability of the point @xmath140 ,",
    "it is not possible to consider the jacobian since this would presume @xmath215 ( the jacobian contains elements @xmath216 ) . with perturbation analysis , it is however possible to show that @xmath217 is an attractive fixed point .",
    "to do so , consider a small perturbation from the point @xmath47 : @xmath218 where @xmath219 denotes the perturbation .",
    "then by inserting eq.tt and @xmath210 into eq.t_tau , the following equation is obtained :          showing that @xmath221 when @xmath222 if @xmath223 , which shows that @xmath47 is attractive if @xmath223 .",
    "eq.l_admitted showed that @xmath210 is the only solution admitted for @xmath10 , hence : @xmath217 is an attractive fixed point if @xmath223 .",

    "<S> a macroeconomic model based on the economic variables ( i ) assets , ( ii ) leverage ( defined as debt over asset ) and ( iii ) trust ( defined as the maximum sustainable leverage ) is proposed to investigate the role of credit in the dynamics of economic growth , and how credit may be associated with both economic performance and confidence . </S>",
    "<S> our first notable finding is the mechanism of reward / penalty associated with patience , as quantified by the return on assets . in regular economies where the ebita / assets ratio is larger than the cost of debt , starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest long - term return on assets ( which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth ) </S>",
    "<S> therefore , patient economies that first build trust and then increase leverage are positively rewarded . </S>",
    "<S> our second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central bank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth . </S>",
    "<S> we find that late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highest long - term return on assets and largest asset value . </S>",
    "<S> but this comes at the cost of suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon that late intervention is most effective to attain a high long - term return on assets can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows trust to increase first , and it is most effective to intervene when trust is high . </S>",
    "<S> these results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying our model : ( a ) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage ; ( b ) economic agents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of assets . using a markov switching model for the ebita / assets ratio , </S>",
