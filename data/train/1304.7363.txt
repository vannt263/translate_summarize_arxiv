    "beams of vortex particles are basically beams with phase singularity , which occurs in the absence of intensity and ambiguity of wave front phase in the center of a beam  @xcite . wave front of such particles is of the form of spiral , and a wave phase varies from @xmath4 to @xmath5 multiply to @xmath6 when moving on a blade of spiral . in this case",
    "@xmath6 characterizes the power of `` vortex '' and is called topological charge or orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "the `` vortex effect '' is achieved by overlap of wave fronts of separate particles in such a way that in each point of space the local wave directions are vortexed relative to a preferred axis ( for example , relative to a mean impulse of wave ) .",
    "the existence of vortex photon beams was theoretically predicted in work  @xcite 20 years ago .",
    "the authors considered the transformation of laser beams with amplitude of laguerre - gauss distribution to the beams with hermite - gauss distribution .",
    "they showed that in the result of such distribution the photons get oam , which can be measured mechanically .",
    "the study of vortex electrons started later with fundamental work  @xcite .",
    "the authors demonstrated the occurrence of oam in beams of free electrons from the solution of schrdinger equation for paraxial wave packets with a vortex phase and found the connection between oam and magnetic momentum for such particles .",
    "the authors of recent experiments  @xcite have obtained beams of the so called vortex electrons with orbital angular momentum of up to @xmath7 .",
    "direct measurements of the oam value carried by electrons can be performed determining the mechanical moment transferred to a target if electrons are totally absorbed in it . however , unlike similar measurements with an oam photon beam , the absorption of electrons in a target is connected with non - uniform energy deposition along both the beam profile and the target depth , which will introduce noticeable errors during oam measurements .",
    "the accuracy of optical measurements being several orders higher than that of mechanical measurements , it seems undoubtedly promising to determine the electrons oam values by their radiation characteristics .",
    "the main mechanisms of nonrelativistic electron radiation are bremsstrahlung and transition radiation ( tr )  @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms have already been studied in details both in theory and experimentally .",
    "the authors of paper  @xcite have shown that oam summarizes with the intrinsic electron magnetic moment , which leads to the increase of resultant magnetic moment that is @xmath6 times greater than bohr magneton @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , a beam of electrons with oam that is parallel or antiparallel to a momentum can be formed by spatial selection . since in this case the orbital momentum @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is unit momentum vector ) quantization axis is determined for electron beams with oam ( it coincides with averaged electron beam momentum @xmath11 )",
    ", the same quantization axis can be used for the electron magnetic moment @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is gyromagnetic ratio ) and one can consider the so called longitudinal magnetic momentum orientation .",
    "it is well known that the bremsstrahlung intensity in the range of photon energies @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is electron lorentz factor , @xmath16 is target material plasma frequency , is significantly suppressed as compared to transition radiation yield . in the case of nonrelativistic electrons",
    "@xmath17 , the process of optical tr is more preferable for the investigation of oam electron radiation characteristics , since while @xmath18 , the intensity of tr is significantly higher than that of bremsstrahlung .",
    "authors of work  @xcite observed the optical transition radiation characteristics of electrons with kinetic energy as small as @xmath19kev .    in the case of electrons with magnetic moment or oam ,",
    "tr will not only be generated by the charge , but by a magnetic moment as well .",
    "considering the spatial parity , the scalar value characterizing the transition radiation process of longitudinal magnetic moment @xmath20 can be presented as a mixed vector product characterizing a circular polarization of tr : @xmath21,\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is photon momentum , @xmath23 is a vector perpendicular to the target interface .",
    "it is clear that for perpendicular electron beam incident on the target ( vacuum - medium interface ) the expression  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is identically zero .",
    "however , the circularly polarized radiation component appears with the inclined electron incident with magnetic momentum @xmath20 on the target of non - coplanar geometry ( vector @xmath22 lies out of the plane @xmath24 , see fig.1 ) .",
    "for magnetic moment values @xmath25 , the transition radiation of the `` charge @xmath2 magnetic moment '' system can be considered according to the classical approach with a good accuracy as in paper  @xcite , where the authors only investigated the perpendicular passage through the interface , when the tr circular polarization was absent and , hence , not considered . in work  @xcite , we have obtained the expressions for resulting transition radiated field of the `` charge @xmath2 magnetic moment '' system directed into the back - hemisphere ( around the specular reflection direction ",

    "the radiation defined by a magnetic moment leads to the situation , when the minimum in the radiation intensity will be non - zero ( unlike the ordinary tr ) . for a perfectly conducting target ,",
    "the ordinary tr characteristics do not depend on the energy of photons emitted .",
    "for the tr from a magnetic moment , there is a dependence on frequency ( see the second summand in  ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) ; however the bohr magneton radiation intensity is @xmath72 times smaller than the charge tr intensity  @xcite , so the total intensity virtually does not depend on the frequency .",
    "figure  3 shows the dependence of stokes parameter @xmath41 on polar and azimuthal angles of the tr photons emitted with the same energy .",
    "the calculations were performed for the target tilt angle @xmath67 , since in this case the valley region of the tr is close to @xmath73 , which leads to the increase of expression  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "as one can see in the figure , circular polarization does not exceed 1% for the tr of a longitudinally spin - polarized electron .",
    "however , this value increases significantly for electrons with oam ( @xmath74 ) ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the region of minimum radiation intensity ( near @xmath75 , see figure  2b ) the circular polarization of radiation for electrons with @xmath76 can reach the values of 70% depending on radiation angles ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "hence , one can measure the oam value by measuring the circular polarization of optical transition radiation from electrons with oam in the range of the angles that correspond to the minimum tr intensity , and the accuracy of such optical measurements can be better that 1% .    it should be noted that this value of polarization degree is observed in a very narrow angular range of the order of tenths - hundredth of a degree in the region of minimum of spectral - angular distribution of tr intensity .",
    "hence direct detection of this effect is impossible on the modern level of technology development of vortex electron beams creation .",
    "therefore the most advanced method to measure a degree of circular polarization of tr in the noted range is the use of optical systems .",
    "for example , in work  @xcite the authors proposed to use a parabolic telescope to exclude the effect of pre - wave zone .",
    "the parabolic telescope is a system which is basically a parabolic mirror with a detector placed into the focus of a mirror .",
    "the using of this approach will allow measuring a degree of circular polarization of tr even for very small ranges of radiation angles .",
    "thus , for example , for a beam with diameter of 1 cm ( @xmath77 ) and parabolic mirror with radius 2 cm ( focus distance is 1 cm ) the displacement of a beam for @xmath78 leads to the image formation on the focal surface with size of @xmath79 . in this case value",
    "@xmath80 greatly exceeds the value of diffraction limit @xmath81 .",
    "( for energy of photon @xmath82 ev ) . using a slot with aperture of @xmath83 one can precisely measure the degree of circular polarization in the region of minimum of spectral - angular distribution of tr , neglecting the influence of maxima in distribution .",
    "the tr characteristics for polished aluminum in the optical region are close to the calculated ones for perfect conductor  @xcite .",
    "the evaluations obtained hereinabove are expected to be valid for a polished metal target .",
    "the authors of work  @xcite have shown that the strict consideration of the quantum corrections leads to significant increase of bohr magneton tr intensity and which was calculated using classical electrodynamics .",
    "but if magnetic momentum @xmath84 100-fold exceeds the bohr magneton , as in the case under consideration , one should expect that the quantum corrections will be insignificant .",
