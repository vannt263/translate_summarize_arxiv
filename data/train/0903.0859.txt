    "magnetoencephalography ( meg ) records magnetic fields generated from neurons when the brain is performing a specific function . neural activities thus can be noninvasively studied through analyzing the meg data .",
    "since the number of neurons ( unknowns ) are far larger than the number of meg sensors ( knowns ) outside the brain , the problem of identifying activated neurons from the magnetic data is ill posed .",
    "the problem becomes even more severe when noise is present .        a first and essential step in surpassing",
    "the obstacle of ill - posedness is to rely on prior knowledge of the general area of active current sources producing the meg data .",
    "often , this prior knowledge is provided by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) experiments .",
    "the two kinds of experiments complement each other , meg has high temporal resolution ( about @xmath0s ) but poor spatial resolution , whereas fmri has high spatial resolution @xcite but poor temporal resolution ( about 1 s ) .",
    "consider auditory neural activity .",
    "fmri shows that such activity is concentrate in the auditory cortex , two 40 mm by 15 mm areas respectively located on the two sides of the cortex ( l ) .",
    "because of poor temporal resolution , fmri can not resolve the rapid successive firing of the ( groups of ) neurons , instead it shows large areas of the auditory cortex lighting up . under meg , the same auditory activity will be detected by high time - resolution sensors ( r ) which however collectively cover an area ( when projected down to the cortex ) much greater than the auditory cortex .    although many methods have been proposed to attack the ill - posed problem , including dipole fitting , minimum - norm - least - square ( mnls ) @xcite , and the maximum entropy method ( me ) @xcite ,",
    "improvements have been limited .",
    "one reason for this may be that these methods do not properly include anatomic constrains . in this work ,",
    "we propose a novel approach to analyze noisy meg data based on me that pays special attention to obtaining better _ priors _ as input to the me procedure by employing clustering and forward and backward filtering processes that take anatomic constrains into consideration .",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by testing it on several simple cases .",
    "given the set of current sources ( dipole strengths ) \\{@xmath1 } at sites \\{@xmath2 } , the magnetic field strength @xmath3 measured by the sensor at spatial position * x * is given by , @xmath4where the function @xmath5 , which is a function of @xmath6 , is derived from the biot - savart law in vacuum , @xmath7 is a noise term , and a hatted symbol denotes an @xmath8-component vector in source space .",
    "we consider the case where there are @xmath9 sensors at locations * x*@xmath10 , @xmath11=1,2,@xmath12 . to simplify notation , we write @xmath13 as an @xmath9-component vector whose @xmath14 component is @xmath15=@xmath16 , similarly for @xmath17 and @xmath18",

    "the presence of noise raises the level of difficulty of the inverse problem .",
    "* human cortex and meg sensors*. in typical quantitative brain studies , the approximately 10@xmath21 neurons in the cortex are simulated by about 2.4@xmath2210@xmath23 current dipoles whose directions are set parallel to the normal of the cortex surface @xcite . for this study",
    "we focus on the auditory cortex , the area marked by the 40 mm@xmath22 15 mm rectangular shown in l that contains 2188 current dipoles .    in typical meg experiments the human head",
    "is surrounded by a hemispheric tiling of magnetic field sensors called superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) . in the experiment we consider ,",
    "there are 157 sensors , each composed of a pair of co - axial coils of 15.5 mm diameter 50 mm apart , with the lower coil about 50 mm above the scalp @xcite .",
    "the centers of the sensors are represented by the gray dots in r. details of geometry and of the a - matrixes in are given in @xcite .    * artificial meg data and noise*. we use artificial meg data generated by the forward equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : m = ar ] ) , from sets of current dipoles ( to be specified below ) in a small area ( black circles in r ) within the auditory cortex ( the gray `` rectangular '' region in l , enlargement shown in r ) .",
    "a site - independent white gaussian noise is linearly superimposed on the meg data .",
    "the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is defined as snr=-10log_10||_max||^2/||_max||^2 where @xmath24 is the amplitude at the sensor receiving the strongest noiseless meg signal , and @xmath25 is amplitude of the strongest simulated noise . in this study",
    "we have @xmath24=7.4 ft ( ft= femto - tesla ) and @xmath25=0.05@xmath24=0.37 ft , so that @xmath26=26 on each individual run .",
    "the artificial meg data is generated by giving a current of 10 na ( nano - ampere ) to each of the sources in a source set ( see below ) , running the forward equation with noise 10 times and taking the averaged strengths at the sensors .",
    "the averaging has the effect of reducing the effective @xmath25 by a factor of @xmath27 , and yielding an enhanced effective signal to noise ratio of @xmath28=36 .    using a threshold of @xmath29=14@xmath25=5.1 ft we select a subset @xmath30 of 7 `` strong signal '' sensors .",
    "this implies a minimum value of @xmath28=32.9 ( with averaging ) on each sensor in the set .",
    "given the ( assumed ) normal distribution of noise intensity , this selection implies that at 99.99@xmath31 confidence level the signals considered are not noise .",
    "similarly we use a threshold of @xmath32=6@xmath25=2.2 ft to select a subset @xmath33 of 31 `` clear signal '' sensors , with minimum values of @xmath28=25.6 on each sensor in the set . in actual computations below ,",

    "me performs not as well as c - me and f - me when 1-@xmath39@xmath790.025 but is better when smaller values of 1-@xmath39 .",
    "note that the @xmath40 set contains 2188 sources and the @xmath41 set 13 sources .",

    "this is because @xmath42 may take only take four values , 1 when @xmath42 contains both true clusters , 0.63 or 0.37 when it contains of the two , and 0 when it contains none .",
    "recall that clustering simplifies the organization of the sources ( @xmath40 ) but does not reduce the _ prior _ positives ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "f reduces the _ prior _ @xmath42 but does not simplify @xmath40 .",
    "c - f does both . that procedures with f are clearly better than those without highlights the paramount importance of a better _ prior _ in all but trivial situations when me is employed .",
    "they are distributed in eight clusters ( @xmath57 , @xmath80=1 to 8) containing 18 , 31 , 15 , 12 , 9 , 23 , 18 , and 17 sources , respectively , for a total of 143 sources .",

    "again , procedures with f , which generate better _ priors _ , yield more accurate positives than those without .",
    "it is worth pointing out the accuracies of the positives given by f - me and c - f - me are very similar in almost the entire range of 1-@xmath39 , but f - me is decisively better than c - f - me when 1-@xmath39 is less than 0.01 .",
    "the last effect brings out an inherent weakness of clustering .",
    "if the active sources ( the @xmath41 set ) are spread out in more than one cluster and and if the union of the clusters is greater than the @xmath41 set , then a solution with a non - null @xmath42 ( @xmath38@xmath810 ) and null @xmath46 ( 1-@xmath39=0 ) is not possible .",
