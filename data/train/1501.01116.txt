    "studies of phase transitions and critical phenomena in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems have shown that the critical behavior can be organized into universality classes , which are identified by a small number of features among them the symmetry .",
    "the most widely studied universality class , due to its experimental implications , is the ising universality class which includes equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the ising universality class is the up - down symmetry .",
    "another class , that includes only nonequilibrium systems , is the direct percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "the main feature that distinguishes this class from the others is the presence of a single absorbing state .",
    "that is , if a system displays a continuous phase transition to a single absorbing state with no extra symmetry or conserving laws then its critical behavior belongs to the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to analyze models that possess features pertaining to the two universality classes . here , we focus on models belonging to the ising and dp universality classes , that is , systems with up - down symmetry and an absorbing state @xcite . due to the up - down symmetry , these systems , in fact , have two symmetric single absorbing states .",
    "lattice models of this type have been studied numerically @xcite revealing the existence of two transition points when a parameter is varied : a symmetry breaking point belonging to the ising universality class and another belonging to the dp universality class .",
    "another numerical study in two dimensions by the method of langevin equation @xcite , with two parameters , has shown that the two critical points evolve into two transition lines that meet at a certain point , given rise to a third transition line .",
    "this study confirm the ising and dp character of the two lines and the existence of a point on the third line corresponding to the voter model @xcite , which is not the meeting point .",
    "it has been claimed that the symmetry breaking transition is not of the ising type @xcite , but monte carlo simulations on a two - dimensional interacting monomers model @xcite confirmed the ising transition . in the present study ,",
    "we wish to clear up this point and analyze the role played by the voter model .",
    "this is achieved by studying lattice models with up - down symmetry and two absorbing states in two and three dimensions by numerical simulations and mean field approach .",
    "our results confirmed the existence of the ising and dp lines and revealed that two lines meet at the voter point and that this is the only point at the third line which is critical .",
    "the phase diagram in the two - dimensional space of parameters displays three phases : paramagnetic ( p ) , ferromagnetic ( f ) and absorbing ( a ) , as shown in figure [ cross]a .",
    "the pf line that separates the p and f phases is a critical line belonging to the ising universality class .",
    "the fa line that separates the a phase and the f phase , understood as an active phase , is a critical line belonging to the dp universality class .",
    "the two lines , pf and fa , meet at the point corresponding to the voter model . as to the pa line , that separates the p and a phases , it is a discontinuous transition line that ends at the voter point . along the pa line the jump in the order parameter is a constant and equals the jump observed in the voter model . for an appropriate description of the critical properties around the voter point , it is convenient to introduce two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , that define a reference frame centered with origin at the voter point .",
    "the @xmath1-axis and @xmath3-axis are parallel and perpendicular to the direction defined by the discontinuous transition line , as shown in figure [ cross]a .",
    "the order parameter @xmath4 of the f phase , shown in figure [ cross]b is assumed to obey the following scaling relation , around the voter point , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the crossover exponent and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are valid for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . the universal function @xmath11 is a step function .",
    "the universal function @xmath12 vanishes according to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ising order parameter exponent and @xmath15 is a positive constant so that , near the ising critical line , the order ising parameter @xmath4 behaves as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the amplitude @xmath18 diverges as @xmath19 .",
    "the universal function @xmath12 approaches its maximum value 1 according to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dp order parameter exponent and @xmath22 is a constant so that , near the dp critical line , the dp order parameter @xmath23 behaves as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the amplitude @xmath26 diverges as @xmath27 .",
    "the ising and dp critical lines occur when @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 so that the size of the f phase behave near the voter point as @xmath32    1.5 cm",
    "we consider stochastic variables that take two values , @xmath33 , called spin variables .",
    "they are located on the sites of a regular lattice which is either a two - dimensional triangular lattice or a three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "notice that both lattices have the same coordination number , which is six .",
    "the system evolves in time according to a continuous time markov process with a single - site change .",
    "the single - site transition rate @xmath34 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 is set up in such way as to hold the properties : a ) it has the up - down symmetry , that is , it is invariant under the transformation @xmath37 ; b ) it depends on the neighboring spin variables only through the sum of these spin variables .",
    "a transition rate that fulfils these two properties is given by @xmath38 where the sum in @xmath39 extends over the six nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath40 is an odd function of @xmath41 .",
    "the most general form of @xmath40 has three parameters .",
    "let us denote by @xmath42 , @xmath43 the spins of the six nearest neighbor sites of a central site @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 taking into account that @xmath46 , then @xmath47 may take only the values @xmath48 from which follows that the most general form of an odd function @xmath40 can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath15 , @xmath22 and @xmath50 are parameters . here , it is convenient to define new parameters @xmath51/2 $ ] , @xmath52/2 $ ] and @xmath53/2 $ ] , that is , @xmath54",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56 in terms of these parameters , the transition probabilities are as shown in table [ trans ]",

    "consider two nearest neighbor sites initially in states @xmath68 .",
    "all the other nearest neighbors of this pair of spins are positive except one of them which is negative .",
    "next , they change their states according to the cyclic sequence @xmath69 .",
    "using the rules of table [ trans ] we find that the ratio between the transition probabilities of this path and of its reverse equals @xmath70 , which in general is distinct from the unit .",
    "thus , there is no microscopic reversibility and no detailed balance .    to meet the two features of the ising and dp universality class , that is , up - down symmetry and two equivalent single absorbing states",
    ", the transition rate should lead to an absorbing state .",
    "this is accomplished by imposing the restriction @xmath58 because in so doing the transition rate will vanish whenever all spins are up or all spins are down , which are the two states identified as the equivalent absorbing states . in this case",
    ", the transition rates do not obey detailed balance , which amounts to say that the two features mentioned above are only possible in systems that in the stationary states are out of equilibrium .",
    "when @xmath58 , the phase diagram is restricted to the plane @xmath71 , and the voter model corresponds to the point @xmath72 of this diagram .",
    "as we shall see , the phase diagram displays a paramagnetic phase , a ferromagnetic phase and an absorbing state , as explained before .",
    "a qualitative phase diagram is obtained by the use of a mean - field approximation . to this end",
    ", we start by writing the function @xmath40 in the form @xmath73 where the first summation runs over @xmath74 from 1 to 6 , and has 6 terms ; the second summation runs over @xmath75 with the restriction @xmath76 and has 20 terms ; and the third summation runs over @xmath77 with the restriction @xmath78 and has 6 terms . the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath26 , and @xmath79 are related to @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 by @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85    the time evolution of the magnetization @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 or @xmath88 where translation invariance has been used .",
    "next , we use the simplest mean - field approximation , for which @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , to write @xmath92    here , we are interested in the case @xmath58 which is equivalent to @xmath93 so that @xmath94 which is identical to the deterministic part of the langevin equation considered in reference @xcite . in the stationary state ,",
    "the possible solutions are as follows .",
    "a ) @xmath95 , corresponding to the paramagnetic ( p ) phase ; it is stable as long as @xmath96 , which is equivalent to @xmath97 .",
    "b ) @xmath98 , corresponding the absorbing ( a ) phase ; it is stable as long as @xmath99 , which is equivalent to @xmath100 .",
    "c ) @xmath101 and @xmath102 , corresponding to the ferromagnetic ( f ) phase .",
    "the phase diagram in the plane @xmath71 is shown in figure [ diagmf ] .",
    "the p - f line is given by @xmath103 , or @xmath104 , and the f - a line is given by @xmath105 , or @xmath59 .",
    "the point corresponding to the voter model is located at the point where the two lines meet , that is , at @xmath106 , or @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the p - f and f - a transitions are continuous whereas the p - a transition is discontinuous .",
    "the discontinuous p - a transition line shown in figure [ diagmf ] was obtained as follows .",
    "we start by writing equation ( [ 20 ] ) in the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 . interpreting @xmath109 as a free energy",
    "then the discontinuous transition occurs when @xmath110 , which gives @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "inside the f phase , the magnetization @xmath4 is given by @xmath113 near the critical line pf , @xmath114 , we may write @xmath115^{-1/2}\\ ] ] so that the amplitude @xmath18 diverges with an exponent @xmath116 as one approaches the voter point . analogously , near the fa transition , @xmath117 , the order parameter @xmath118 behaves as @xmath119^{-1}\\ ] ] so that the amplitude @xmath26 diverges with an exponent @xmath120 as one approaches the voter point .",
    "it is worth to notice that the size @xmath121 of the ferromagnetic phase , given by @xmath122 vanishes linearly as one approaches the voter point .",
    "the results obtained from numerical simulations on the cubic and triangular lattice allow us to conclude that the topology of the phase diagram is the same as the one obtained from the mean - field approximation .",
    "the numerical simulations on these lattices were carried out as follows . at each time",
    "step a site of the lattice is chosen at random and updated according to the transition probabilities in table [ trans ] , restricted to the case @xmath58 .",
    "the averages of several quantities were obtained in the stationary state . defining @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number of sites ,",
    "then the quantities of interest to analyze the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic line are the magnetization @xmath125 the susceptibility , @xmath126 the binder cumulant @xmath127    examples of these quantities , for the cubic lattice with @xmath128 sites , calculated along the line @xmath129 , are shown in figures [ mag13d ] and [ susc13d ] . at the p - f transition point ,",
    "the binder cumulant @xmath130 is a constant , a result that allows to located the p - f transition line .",
    "the critical behavior of @xmath4 and @xmath131 allows to say that , with respect to the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition , the model belongs to the universality class of the ising model .    to analyze the ferromagnetic - absorbing transition , where the ferromagnetic phase is identified as the active phase , we define the quantity @xmath132 , which is the order parameter that characterizes the transition from active to absorbing . in figure",
    "[ rho13d ] , we show @xmath118 versus @xmath81 along the line @xmath129",
    ". the location of the transition is obtained by the extrapolation @xmath29 , what allows us to draw the f - a line .",
    "the critical behavior shows that with respect to this transition , the model belongs to direct percolation universality class .    using the data of the p - f and f - a transitions obtained for several values of @xmath82 we draw the phase diagram of figure [ diagcub]a . as expected the two lines , p - f and f - a , meet at the voter point located at @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in figure",
    "[ diagcub]b we show the size @xmath133 of the f phase as a function of the distance from the voter point @xmath134 .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the data points has a finite slope at the origin which amounts do say that the scaling relation @xmath135 is fulfiled with @xmath136 .",
    "we have also determined the nature of the phase transition between the p and a phases .",
    "as we cross the transition line the order parameter jumps from zero , which is the value of @xmath4 within the paramagnetic phase , to the maximum value @xmath137 , which is the value of @xmath4 inside the absorbing phase .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath131 increases as one approaches the transition line from the paramagnetic phase and reaches a finite value @xmath138 which depends on the distance @xmath134 from the voter point . as one approaches the voter point @xmath139 increases without limits and diverges with an exponent @xmath140 .",
    "notice that , according to our numerical results for the susceptibility obtained along @xmath60 , the susceptibility @xmath131 diverges as one approaches the voter point from the paramagnetic phase with the same exponent @xmath140 .",
    "we have also studied the model defined on a triangular lattice by using the same methods . as can be seen in figure [ diagtri ]",
    ", the phase diagram also displays the three phases found in the cubic lattice .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic phase is very narrow , becoming very difficult to extract the crossover exponent but the two lines , pf and fa , seems to meet tangentially in consistency with an exponent @xmath141 with logarithm corrections as we will argue below .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of a system belonging to the ising and dp universality classes . the phase diagram in the two parameters",
    "has an ising critical line separating the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase , a dp critical line separating the ferromagnetic phase and the absorbing phase , and a discontinuous phase transition line separating the paramagnetic and the absorbing phase .",
    "the three lines meet at the voter point in such as way that the size of the ferromagnetic phase vanishes as one approaches the voter point with a crossover exponent @xmath6 .",
    "the crossover exponent should be understood as the ratio between the two exponents related to the two relevant scaling fields @xmath1 and @xmath3 around the voter point . above the critical dimension @xmath142 of the voter model",
    ", these two exponents do not depend on dimension so that the same should happen to the crossover exponent .",
    "taking into account that the upper critical dimension of the voter critical point is @xmath143 , we expect the crossover exponent @xmath6 to have the same value for @xmath144 with possible logarithm corrections when @xmath145 .",
    "the results coming from mean - field theory gives @xmath141 which allows to conclude that @xmath141 for @xmath144 , a result confirmed by our calculations in @xmath146 .",
    "as to the two - dimensional case , the size of the ferromagnetic phase is too narrow for a precise numerical calculation but is consistent with the result @xmath141 with logarithm corrections .    the results for the susceptibility around the ising and dp lines are in accordance with these two universality classes .",
    "concerning the discontinuous transition from the paramagnetic to the absorbing transition , we found that the susceptibility is finite at the transition line but diverges as one approaches the voter point",
    ".    it would be very interesting if the picture that we have drawn concerning the critical behavior of systems belonging to the ising and dp universality classes could be confirmed by a renormalization group calculation by means of a langevin equation formulation ."
