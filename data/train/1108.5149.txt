    "the acceleration of discoveries of extrasolar systems is providing a base of data for inferring the current properties as well as the histories of planetary systems .",
    "understanding planetary systems in general provides the essential context for our own solar system as well .",
    "a system s current dynamical state is the result of the initial planet formation , orbital evolution in the nebula , close planet - planet encounters , and subsequent long - term tidal evolution .",
    "thus its orbital characteristics and distributions provide a key to the systems origin and evolution .",
    "an important step is to find ways to characterize systems that shed light on their history .",
    "an essential part of the initial discovery process is determination of the current keplerian orbital elements . however , mutual perturbations cause these elements to change on timescales short compared with the age of a system .",
    "observers have long been well aware of this issue , so numerical integration is typically part of the orbit - fitting process because it helps rule out ranges of masses and orbital elements that might be consistent with observational data , but inconsistent with long - term stability .",
    "mutual interactions are enhanced by orbital resonances , which are thus especially interesting from the point of view of dynamical theory . however , even in systems with no resonances , secular interactions can be important , and the nature of those interactions can be a key to the history and properties of these systems .",
    "keplerian orbital elements are constants of integration in the two - body problem , but they are not constant when multiple planets interact . in secular interactions ,",
    "planets exchange angular momentum , so eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter vary periodically . as long as eccentricities are not too large , the analytical solutions of classical secular theory provide constants of integration that represent the system better than the keplerian elements . while in principle numerical integrations can represent the behavior more precisely , secular theory provides a way to characterize , classify , interpret , and compare the dynamical states of various systems . in this paper , we demonstrate how this characterization can provide insight into the origin and evolution of the system .",
    "the `` character '' of a system as used here refers to any of a number of different qualitative behaviors revealed by secular theory .",
    "the extent to which a system exhibits certain characteristics defines what we mean by its current dynamical state .",
    "one of the evolutionary processes that governs long - term evolution is the effect of tides . in a single - planet system",
    "the effect of tides is comparatively uncomplicated ( for example , jackson et al .",
    "2008@xcite ) .",
    "the planet s energy and angular momentum change , affecting the semi - major axis and eccentricity values .",
    "the inclination is affected as well , but in this paper we consider only systems in which all orbital and rotational axes are ( or can reasonably be assumed to be ) aligned . in multi - planet systems ,",
    "secular interactions redistribute angular momentum among the planets , so that the effect of tides is shared . over the long term ,",
    "the result is not only a change in keplerian elements , but also a gradual qualitative change in the secular character of a system .",
    "notably , tidal evolution can lead to an alignment of the orientation of the major axes .",
    "another past process that can leave a signature on the current secular character of a system is planet - planet scattering .",
    "suppose two planets undergo a close encounter , resulting in large eccentricities ( including the possible ejection of one from the system as in the case described by ford and rasio 2005@xcite ) .",
    "immediately after the event , the other planets may retain the nearly circular orbits acquired during their formation within a nebula .",
    "then , the subsequent secular interactions must result in periodic changes in all the eccentricities , so that at any observational epoch , all the keplerian eccentricities may be substantial .",
    "however , because the secular interactions are periodic , the dynamical behavior in such a case is characterized by periodic returns to circular orbits , i.e. `` near - separatrix behavior '' when considered in terms of secular theory ( barnes and greenberg 2006a)@xcite .    in this paper wel",
    "consider several specific planetary systems and types of behavior to demonstrate how the classical treatment of secular theory can reveal the signatures of such past events and evolution .",
    "the key to the value of this approach is that classical secular theory can be described by sets of straightforward linear differential equations , so that the solutions are expressed as sums of eigenmodes .",
    "the constants of integration that characterize the system are the magnitudes and phases of these eigenmodes , rather than keplerian elements like the eccentricities and pericenter longitudes .",
    "with understanding of these results , there is the potential to infer significant aspects of the past evolution by inspection of the values of these parameters .",
    "for example , in the presence of secular interactions , any process ( such as tides ) that tends to damp the eccentricity of one or more planets will actually have the effect of damping all of the eigenmodes , each at a different rate .",
    "eventually , when only the longest lived eigenmode remains , the major axes are aligned , a distinctly recognizable orbital behavior that is the hallmark of eccentricity damping . however , as we show below , major axes being locked in alignment does not necessarily mean that only one eigenmode is dominant .",
    "moreover , as we show with the example of 61 virginis and hip 14810 in sect .",
    "[ 61vir ] and [ hip14810 ] , the eigenmode that dominates the behavior of the damped planet is not necessarily the one that damps fastest , contrary to some preconceptions . we also show in sect .",
    "[ mardling ] that the relative rates of damping of the eigenmodes provide a useful way to interpret the effects of tidal damping derived in a complementary analysis by mardling ( 2007)@xcite .    for another example of the value of the classical secular approach , consider the signature of planet - planet scattering : a periodic return of at least one planet to a circular orbit .",
    "this condition is readily identified by inspection of the magnitudes of the eigenmodes for each planet .",
    "if a combination can sum to zero , it means that eccentricities must periodically return to zero .",
    "thus the secular solution can reveal which systems may have suffered a planet - planet scattering event , as discussed further in sect .",
    "[ 55cncf08 ] .",
    "the degree to which planets share the effects of the same eigenmodes describes how strongly coupled their behavior is , and thus can shed light on ( and help quantify ) the closeness of packing of the planets , with important implications for the origin and evolution of the system .",
    "the ability to quantify the strength of the coupling is also useful for checking the plausibility of observational orbit fits .",
    "this point is demonstrated for the case of 55 cancri ( sect .",
    "[ 55cnc ] ) , where we show that an orbital fit with the inner planet held circular is consistent with the mutual gravitational effects among the planets .    these and other examples of the insight that can be derived from classical secular theory are discussed in sect .",
    "[ 55cnc ] to [ othsys ] .",
    "the underlying theory is comprehensively described in various textbooks ( e.g. brouwer and clemence 1961@xcite , murray and dermott 2000@xcite ) , and we review it briefly here ( sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) to make the presentation complete , to establish our notation , and to include the effect of eccentricity damping .",
    "classical secular theory involves averaging the disturbing force at a planet due to each other planet over the planets orbital periods .",
    "then the remaining disturbing potential is used to calculate the changes in keplerian orbital elements over time . in effect , the gravitational interactions are computed as if each planet s mass is smeared out along its keplerian orbit with the portion of the mass in any segment of this path determined by how much time the planet would spend there in unperturbed keplerian motion . in practice ,",
    "the disturbing potential is expanded in a fourier series , and those terms are ignored that explicitly contain orbital longitudes in the arguments of the sines or cosines ( brouwer and clemence 1961@xcite , murray and dermott 2000@xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , this approach would not be valid where any of the planets are in mean - motion resonance .",
    "here we also assume that the orbits are co - planar and that the eccentricities are small enough that terms in the disturbing function higher than second order in the eccentricities can be ignored . as we discuss in sect .",
    "[ mardling ] , even if eccentricity values are fairly large , this approach can still give at least qualitatively meaningful results .",
    "it is also quite straightforward to include general relativity , because its effect on orbital precession has the same functional form as terms in the planetary disturbing function .",
    "the variation equations take on a simple linear form if we replace the keplerian elements eccentricity ( @xmath1 ) and longitude of pericenter ( @xmath2 ) with the elements @xmath3 and @xmath4 :    @xmath5    @xmath6    where the subscript p is an integer denoting the planet , in order from nearest to farthest from the star . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the cartesian components of the eccentricity vector , whose magnitude is @xmath9 and direction is given by @xmath10 . expressing lagrange s equations for planetary perturbations in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 yields the linear differential equations :    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the number of planets in the system and the matrix @xmath14 depends on the masses and semi - major axes of the planets and the mass of the star as given , for example , by murray and dermott ( 2000)@xcite . additional precession effects due to general relativity , oblateness of the primary , etc . ,",
    "can be accommodated by incorporation in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc .    as standard first - order linear differential equations , the solution of eqns .",
    "[ kdot ] and [ hdot ] is a sum of eigenmodes :    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the eigenvectors and @xmath20 are the corresponding eigenfrequencies .",
    "here we let the subscript @xmath21 denote the eigenmodes in order of decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath19 for a given mode describes how the power is partitioned among the planets , and it is normalized such that for each mode the root mean square is one . here , the eigenvectors are normalized so that , for a given m , the root mean square of the @xmath13 planets components is unity .",
    "the mode strengths @xmath22 and phases @xmath23 are the constants of integration , while the keplerian elements vary with time .",
    "the constants of integration are determined by using the known eccentricities and @xmath2 values ( equivalent to the known @xmath7,@xmath8 values ) at any given time ( i.e. initial conditions ) .",
    "inspection of eqns .",
    "[ hsol ] and [ ksol ] shows that for each planet the ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) vector ( which we call the eccentricity vector or @xmath1 vector , with length @xmath9 and direction @xmath10 ) is the sum of @xmath13 component vectors in ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) space , each corresponding to a particular eigenmode and rotating in ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) space at an angular velocity given by @xmath20 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , for a given eigenmode , the component vector contributed to the planets are all either parallel or anti - parallel , because they all point in the direction @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "so , if only one of the eigenmodes has non - negligible strength , all the planets directions of pericenter would be aligned ( if the signs of @xmath19 are the same ) or anti - aligned ( if the signs of @xmath19 are opposite ) .",
    "equivalently , we can say the planets major axes ( or lines of apsides ) are aligned or anti - aligned .    for each mode , the relative magnitudes of the components @xmath19 describe how strongly that mode affects a given planet compared with the other planets . and",
    "for a given planet , the relative magnitudes of the product @xmath26 describes which modes dominate that planet .",
    "these considerations can be used to determine how strongly coupled the interactions may be among various subsets of the planets in a system , as discussed in specific examples in the following sections .",
    "another useful point is that , like the matrix @xmath14 , the eigenvectors and eigenmodes depend only on the masses and semi - major axes of planets in the system , and the mass of the star .",
    "thus some understanding of the character of the system can be developed even if observations are insufficient to determine the eccentricity values precisely ( as demonstrated in sect .",
    "[ gliese581 ] below ) .",
    "suppose some process ( in addition to the gravitational effects taken into account in the derivation of eqns .",
    "[ ksol ] and [ hsol ] ) acts to damp the eccentricity of the inner planet according to    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is positive and constant .",
    "such eccentricity damping can be one effect of tidal dissipation ( e.g. goldreich and soter 1966@xcite , yoder and peale 1981@xcite , jackson et al .",
    "2008@xcite ) , although here we are not considering other effects of tides such as changes in the semi - major axis .",
    "eccentricity damping can be incorporated into the secular theory by adding a term @xmath29 to @xmath30 and @xmath31 to @xmath32 in eqns .",
    "[ kdot ] and [ hdot ] , and therefore adding the term @xmath33i to @xmath15 ( where @xmath34 ) .",
    "the secular equations are still linear , so solutions are still straightforward ( e.g. chiang and murray ( 2002)@xcite ) .",
    "however , the eigenvalues will now be complex , which introduces an exponential decrease of each of the mode strengths , @xmath22 .",
    "even if the damping process acts directly on only one planet , the secular interactions redistribute angular momentum among the planets , so that eventually all the eccentricities die away .",
    "however , each eigenmode damps according to its own exponential timescale .",
    "thus , as a damping proceeds a stage is reached where only the longest - lived eigenmode remains .",
    "this condition has been called a `` fixed point '' solution or , in recognition of the fact that eventually even the longest - lived eigenmode damps away , a `` quasi - fixed point solution '' ( wu and goldreich 2002@xcite , mardling 2007@xcite ) .",
    "as long as the one longest - lived eigenmode remains , this condition is characterized by aligned or anti - aligned major axes . before this condition is reached , but after the other eigenmodes have become smaller than the long - lived mode , their contribution to the total solution of the behavior of the eccentricity vectors is so small that it can only produce librations around the alignment of major axes .",
    "the various properties of the classical solution for secular behavior reviewed in this section have implications for the interpretation of the characteristics of observed extrasolar systems , as demonstrated by the following examples .",
    "the 55 cancri system consists of five known planets : a `` super - earth '' and four giant planets ( fischer et al 2008@xcite , dawson and fabrycky 2010@xcite ) . like the terrestrial planets in our own solar system ,",
    "the relatively small super - earth is on an orbit interior to that of the giants . unlike our solar system ,",
    "the inner planet is close enough to its host star that tides may play a role in the planet s orbital evolution .",
    "table  [ f1 ] shows the best fit to the radial velocity data for 55 cancri from the discovery paper by fischer et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite . here , to simplify notation , we refer to these planets by integer in order of increasing semi - major axis rather than by letters in order of discovery .",
    "more recent solutions by dawson and fabrycky ( 2010)@xcite take aliasing effects into account , yielding a much smaller orbit for the innermost planet .",
    "this shorter period has recently been confirmed by transit observations by winn et al .",
    "( 2011)@xcite with the microvariability and oscillations of stars ( most ) telescope and demory et al .",
    "( 2011)@xcite with the spitzer space telescope .    here , we consider three different solutions for the orbits in this system as examples to illustrate the value of classical secular theory for describing the dynamical character of a planetary system and identifying its implications .",
    "the three systems we consider below are the best - fit from fischer et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite and two of the solutions presented by dawson and fabrycky ( 2010)@xcite . in all of these solutions several planets have strikingly similar longitudes of pericenter ( @xmath2 ) , which can be the consequence of eccentricity damping as discussed in sect .  [ sec2pt2 ] . given that the inner planet is close to its star , one might expect tidal dissipation to have been responsible .",
    "however , before accepting such a conclustion we must consider the actual magnitude of each eigenmode and how each eigenmode affects the eccentricities of the planets .      in the orbit fit by fischer et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite ( our table  [ f1 ] ) , the super - earth and three giant planets all lie within 1 au , while the outermost , and much more massive , planet is at about six times that distance ; the fourth planet in the system has a nearly circular orbit ; and the major axes of planets 1 , 2 , and 5 are currently nearly aligned , that is they have nearly equal @xmath2 values .",
    "the eigenmodes derived from the masses and semi - major axis values according to the theory in sect .",
    "[ sec2pt1 ] are shown in table  [ f2 ] , along with the relative eccentricity damping rates based on the theory in sect .",
    "[ sec2pt2 ] . the actual magnitude ( @xmath22 ) and phase ( @xmath23 ) of each eigenmode",
    "is computed from the current @xmath1 and @xmath2 values . from those results ,",
    "figure  [ figf ] shows the current eccentricity vectors for planets 1 through 5 , each as a vector sum of its 5 eigenmode components .",
    "remember , for each eigenmode , the corresponding vector component circulates at the rate gm given in table  [ f2 ] .",
    "the alignment of the current e vectors for planets 1 , 2 , and 5 is evident in figure  [ figf ] .",
    "however , we note that planet 1 s @xmath1 vector is dominated by the 1st eigenmode and planet 5 s @xmath1 vector is dominated by the 5th eigenmode . for planet 2 ,",
    "the @xmath1 vector is predominantly composed of components from eigenmodes 2 and 3 .",
    "because the vector components for each eigenmode rotate at a different rate ( @xmath20 ) from the other eigenmodes , the current alignment of these three orbits appears to be a coincidence ( if not an observational artifact ) .",
    "the alignment is not the result of damping to a quasi - fixed point . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec2pt2 ] , if the alignment had been due to eccentricity damping , all but the longest - lived eigenmode would have already damped out .",
    "clearly this is not the case .",
    "in fact , the mode that should damp fastest ( mode 1 as shown in table  [ f2 ] ) is actually the strongest in the sense of having the greatest amplitude @xmath22 in this system .",
    "these arguments show how secular theory can help determine whether or not a system may have experienced tidal evolution .",
    "another feature of this system is also revealed by consideration of how strongly each planet is affected by each eigenmode . from table  [ f2 ] and figure  [ figf ] , one can see which planets are controlled by which modes . specifically : planet 1 is most strongly affected by mode 1 , with some contributions by modes 2 and 3 ; planet 2 is controlled by modes 2 and 3 ; planet 3 is dominated by mode 2 , with an appreciable contribution from mode 3 ; planet 4 is controlled by modes 4 and 5 , with a small contribution from mode 3 ; and planet 5 is strongly dominated by mode 5 .",
    "thus , the eigenmodes that affect the inner three planets do not strongly affect the outer two planets and _",
    "vice versa_.    in other words , there are two distinct dynamical groups in the system . in physical terms",
    ", the inner three planets exchange angular momentum among themselves , but do not share very much with the outer two planets .",
    "similarly the outer two planets exchange angular momentum predominantly between themselves . in general , the grouping of planets into subsets that share dominant eigenmodes is diagnostic of groups that exchange angular momentum among themselves due to mutual perturbations .",
    "an extreme case would be a system with negligible exchanges of angular momentum , in which case each planet would be controlled by only one eigenmode , and each eigenmode is associated with the behavior of only that one planet .",
    "the dynamical grouping in this system is not what one might have anticipated based on the planets semi - major axes alone . because the orbit of planet 5 is much larger than that of any of the others , one might have thought that the inner four planets would be grouped together and the outermost planet would be on its own .",
    "but secular theory shows that the dynamical grouping is quite different .",
    "this result demonstrates the value of secular theory for helping to characterize the degree of dynamical packing of any system ( as long as there are no mean - motion resonances involved ) .",
    "additional insight into the two dynamical groups in this system can be gained by further considering the structure of the eigenvectors . for the inner three planets , we see from table  [ f2 ] that the second and third eigenmodes have significant values for all of the inner three planets , corresponding to the strong dynamical grouping .",
    "however , the first mode is quite concentrated in planet 1 .",
    "thus mode 1 provides an additional contribution to planet 1 s eccentricity vector , but the link to the other members of this group is only through modes 2 and 3 , reflecting the fact that planet 1 is too small to affect the other planets significantly .",
    "accordingly , the damping rate for mode 1 is 0.996@xmath28 ( from table  [ f2 ] ) nearly as fast as the direct damping @xmath28 ( as defined in eqn .",
    "[ edampeqn ] ) of the eccentricity of planet 1 , while the other modes damp far more slowly .    in the outer group ,",
    "the coupling is primarily through the shared eigenmode 5 , which is predominantly associated with the outer planet .",
    "mode 5 reflects the effect of planet 5 on planet 4 .",
    "mode 4 is essentially only associated with planet 4 ; the two outer planets are not significantly coupled in this mode , reflecting the small mass of planet 4 and its lack of influence on planet 5 .",
    "one other characteristic of the secular behavior ( assuming the small value of @xmath35 in this orbit fit was correct ) is that the initial conditions of the system ( which set up the @xmath22 values ) were apparently such that planet 4 periodically returns to a circular orbit .",
    "thus the behavior of the outer two planets is similar to the near separatrix secular behavior discussed by barnes and greenberg ( 2006a)@xcite for two - planet systems .",
    "one way to explain this type of behavior is for planet - planet scattering to have occurred early in the system s history ( e.g. ford and rasio 2005@xcite , malhotra 2002@xcite , barnes and greenberg 2007@xcite ) , an event that set the the initial conditions for the subsequent secular interactions .",
    "if planet 4 was not affected by such interactions and remained on an initially circular orbit , while planet 5 was stirred up by a scattering event , then the periodic secular behavior would have to be such that planet 4 periodically returns to a circular orbit .",
    "hence , this type of on - going secular behavior could be the signature of a long - ago epoch of planet - planet scattering .",
    "dawson and fabrycky ( 2010)@xcite reconsidered the orbit solution based on data from fischer et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite and more recent observations , taking aliasing effects into consideration .",
    "their best - fit orbital solution ( our table  [ df1 ] ) , differs from that of fischer et al . in several ways : the innermost planet is on an orbit much closer to its star ; @xmath35 is much larger ; and four of the planets major axes are currently nearly aligned .",
    "our secular analysis yields the eigenmodes for this solution as shown in table  [ df2 ] .",
    "figure  [ figdfbf ] shows each of the planets @xmath1 vectors as a vector sum of the contributions from the five eigenmodes ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ figf ] ) .    in this system ,",
    "planets 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 are all controlled by different eigenmodes .",
    "so the current alignment of major axes is fortuitous , as it was for the fischer et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite orbits .",
    "also , the eigenmode whose eigenvector is most closely associated with the inner planet ( here called mode 2 ) should damp fastest , yet it has a large @xmath22 , indicating a lack of eccentricity damping ( just as for the solution by fischer et al .",
    ".    inspection of the eigenvectors and their amplitudes reveals similar dynamical groups in dawson and fabrycky s best fit to those found for fischer et al.s solution .",
    "however there are some key differences .",
    "first , planet 1 is not nearly as strongly coupled to the other inner planets . in the eigenvectors @xmath19 derived from the fischer et al .",
    "orbits the modes that dominated planets 2 and 3 ( modes 2 and 3 in table  [ f1 ] ) also had significant effects on the innermost planet .",
    "in contrast , the equivalent modes derived from dawson and fabrycky s best fit ( modes 1 and 3 in table  [ df1 ] ) barely affect planet 1 .",
    "this difference reflects the innermost planet s smaller semi - major axis and a consequent relative decoupling from the other planets .",
    "( note , too , that given our convention for ordering the modes , the smaller semi - major axis caused a change in the numbering . )",
    "another difference is that the 4th eigenmode plays a much greater role in the inner planets eccentricities in the solution by dawson and fabrycky , despite the fact that the normalized eigenvector @xmath36 is nearly the same in both solutions .",
    "it has a much greater magnitude ( @xmath37 is @xmath38150 times larger ) following from the larger value of @xmath35 and thus both planets 2 and 3 receive noticeable contributions from the 4th eigenmode .",
    "this result demonstrates that two factors influence what constitutes a dynamical grouping of planets : ( 1 ) the distribution of @xmath19 values for one or more modes affecting those planets and ( 2 ) the magnitude of the eigenmodes , as both @xmath19 and @xmath22 affect the degree to which various planets are exchanging angular momentum .",
    "dawson and fabrycky ( 2010)@xcite also derived an orbital fit for 55 cancri in which planet 1 s eccentricity was held to zero ( table  [ df3 ] ) .",
    "this constraint was motivated by the idea that the eccentricity should have been damped by tides , given the proximity to the star and reasonable assumptions about tidal parameters .",
    "even with this imposed constraint , this fit was nearly as good as their best fit , according to the chi - squared criterion . however , dawson and fabrycky expressed skepticism about this solution , realizing that that the influence of other planets in the system could pump up planet 1 s eccentricity , in which case a low eccentricity would be short lived and therefore improbable .",
    "analyzing this system with secular theory ( table  [ df4 ] ) we find that the eigenvectors and eigenfrequencies are very similar to those from dawson and fabrycky s best fit ( table  [ df2 ] ) . the only significant difference is found in the eigenmode amplitudes .",
    "most significantly , the magnitude @xmath40 of mode 2 is now much less than in the best fit case , because this mode is almost exclusively associated with the inner planet , whose eccentricity is now constrained to zero .",
    "the small amplitude of mode 2 is consistent with the fact that this mode should damp fastest according to the damping rate shown in table  [ df4 ] , and the likelihood that the system has undergone eccentricity damping .",
    "however , we note that while small , the magnitude of the mode 2 component of @xmath39 ( @xmath41 ) is 0.0048 , which is not insignificant . also , modes 1 and 3 contribute a vector component of @xmath39 with values 0.0029 and 0.0019 respectively .",
    "so , although @xmath39 was artificially set to zero at the time of the observation , over the secular variations its value periodically will cycle up to @xmath380.01 .",
    "thus dawson and fabrycky s solution admits interactions that can increase @xmath39 just as they expected .",
    "however , our secular analysis shows @xmath39 does remain fairly small .",
    "thus the solution with the current @xmath39 held near zero is reasonably well justified .",
    "this solution is consistent with moderate eccentricity damping acting on the innermost planet , damping @xmath40 to a fairly small value .",
    "however , a solution consistent with advanced eccentricity damping would have mode 2 damped away entirely ( i.e. @xmath40 near zero ) .",
    "then with even more damping of the inner planet , modes 1 and 3 would damp away next , albeit with damping rates @xmath42 times that of mode 2 according to table  [ df4 ] .",
    "the secular analysis thus gives insight into the validity of imposing constraints on solutions for orbital fits , and allows us to interpret the results in terms of a history of tidal evolution .",
    "the @xmath39 solution by dawson and fabrycky is a good fit with the data , allows @xmath39 to remain small even with secular perturbations , and is consistent with the assumption that the inner planet s eccentricity has been significantly damped .",
    "however , a solution consistent with mature eccentricity damping would have the 2nd eigenmode fully damped , which is not the case in this solution .",
    "the 61 virginis system has three planets : a close - in super - earth and two neptune - scale planets ( vogt et al .",
    "2010a@xcite ) .",
    "vogt et al . ( 2010a)@xcite obtained the best - fit solution shown in table  [ 61v1 ] .",
    "they noted that numerical integration of the system revealed that two of the @xmath1 vectors librate about alignment .",
    "vogt et al . interpreted this condition as indicative of possible tidal evolution . indeed , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec2pt2 ] , damping of a planet s eccentricity can lead to such libration after all eigenmodes except one have largely damped away .",
    "our solution for the eigenmodes is shown in table  [ 61v2 ] and figure  [ fig61v ] .",
    "the vector sums for planet 2 and planet 3 are currently 27@xmath43 apart as reported by vogt et al .",
    ", and figure  [ fig61v ] shows that those two planets are dominated by a single eigenmode ( mode 3 ) , consistent with the libration noted by vogt et al .",
    "however , secular theory shows that this behavior does not imply eccentricity damping , whether due to tides or any other process .",

    "if the inner planet s @xmath1 had been damped significantly , our solution ( table  [ 61v2 ] ) shows that the first eigenmode should have damped on a timescale 600 times shorter than the other modes .",
    "yet we find ( e.g. figure  [ fig61v ] ) that mode 1 is still an important component of @xmath39 .",
    "what is more , our solution shows that mode 2 , which should have damped out on a timescale comparable to mode 1 , is also very strong , so strong that it dominates the inner planet .",
    "thus , while we can not rule out some small amount of @xmath1 damping , there is in fact no evidence for tidal damping from the current secular behavior in this case .",
    "rather the libration of the outer two planets about alignment appears to have been determined by the particular initial conditions that determined the subsequent secular behavior of the system .",
    "in fact , for 61 virginis there is a modest propensity for alignment due to the system s basic architecture .",
    "in other words , given the system s masses and semi - major axis values , random values of the initial eccentricity vectors will tend to favor libration about the alignment of pericenter longitudes observed in this system .",
    "this modest tendency can be seen by inspection of the eigenvectors ( table [ 61v2 ] ) . with the absolute values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 both 0.9 or greater , modes 1 and 2 both affect the inner planet most strongly .",
    "for that reason , even though the strength @xmath40 of the second mode is significant , its effect on the outer planets is modest .",
    "however , mode 3 affects both of the outer planets with comparable strength ( @xmath46 = 0.6 and @xmath47=0.8 ) .",

    "also during this time , the longitudes of pericenter of the two planets circulate relative to one another , with @xmath65 advancing at the greater rate .    at @xmath64 years the system undergoes a transition to a state where the longitudes of pericenter librate relative to one another . at the same time",
    ", the oscillation of @xmath39 begins to damp at a much faster rate , decreasing by a factor of 3 over the next @xmath64 years , while continuing to oscillate at the same frequency .    by about @xmath66 years after the libration phase began ,",
    "the oscillations of both eccentricities have died away and @xmath67 is locked to zero . during the libration phase , the values about which @xmath39 and @xmath59 oscillate gradually decrease .",
    "for @xmath59 it decreases at an exponential rate similar to that during the earlier circulation phase .",
    "for @xmath39 the rate is much slower than in the circulation stage , now close to the exponential rate for @xmath59 .",
    "this phase in which the oscillations have damped down is sometimes called the fixed - point or quasi - fixed - point condition .",
    "classical secular theory reproduces this behavior reasonably well , in fact to a remarkable degree given the large eccentricities involved .",
    "applying mardling s assumed initial conditions , the parameters of the secular solution are the following , as illustrated in figure  [ figm ] .",
    "for @xmath59 , mode 2 contributes a component @xmath68 of magnitude 0.395 , while mode 1 s contribution @xmath69 is only about 1% as large . for @xmath39 ,",
    "mode 2 contributes a component @xmath70 of magnitude  0.008 , parallel to @xmath68 , while mode 1 contributes the larger component @xmath71 of magnitude @xmath380.1 , anti - parallel to @xmath69 . as also shown in figure  [ figm ] , the mode 1 components rotate in direction at a rate @xmath72/yr , relative to the mode 2 components ( @xmath69 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "mardling started her integration at an instant when @xmath71 was directed opposite the mode 2 components in the ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) space , i.e. when @xmath73 .",
    "as evident from inspection of figure [ figm ] , in the secular solution , as @xmath71 circulates ( at rate @xmath72/yr ) relative to mode 2 , the value of @xmath39 oscillates between 0.1 and 0.116 ( because @xmath71=0.108 and @xmath70=0.008 ) , with a period about @xmath74 yr .",
    "pericenter longitude @xmath65 circulates relative to @xmath75 . at the same time",

    "[ sec2pt2 ] ) , we find that mode 1 damps about @xmath76 times faster than mode 2 .",
    "thus the circular trajectory of the @xmath71 vector in ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) space ( relative to the mode 2 components ) will shrink in radius .",
    "this shrinking reduces the amplitude of the oscillation , reproducing the amplitude decrease during the circulation phase in mardling s analysis . similarly , as the mode 1 component @xmath69 shrinks , the oscillations of @xmath59 decrease in amplitude , again mimicking the behavior found by mardling . for both planets ,",
    "the oscillation in @xmath1 values is about a value given by the mode 2 component , which gradually decreases ( 1000 times slower than mode 1 ) .",
    "inspection of figure  [ figm ] also shows that as @xmath71 decreases to the same value as @xmath70 , the system transitions from circulation to libration .",
    "now @xmath39 oscillates about @xmath70 with an amplitude @xmath71 .",
    "eventually mode 1 dies away . with only mode 2 remaining ,",
    "the system is in the quasi - fixed state , during which the eccentricities gradually damp away on an exponential timescale 1000 times slower than the damping of mode 1 .",
    "the evolutionary behavior described by the classical secular approach is similar ( even quantitatively ) to the results obtained by mardling in this hypothetical case , which is remarkable considering the large eccentricities involved .",
    "moreover , the classical approach has certain benefits that complement both numerical integration and mardling s formulation .",
    "mardling emphasized the distinctions between the phases of the evolution ( libration , circulation , and the long - term ( quasi - fixed - point ) damping .",
    "in contrast , the secular solution emphasizes the continuity of this process , with the transitions being simply milestones along the gradual decrease in the magnitudes of the eigenmodes .",
    "while both descriptions are equally valid , the continuous variation emphasized in our classical secular approach is more consistent with the fact that the libration / circulation separatrix in this case is not a boundary between diverging paths in phase space ( i.e. it is not like the separatrix between circulation and oscillation of a pendulum for example ) .",
    "rather , the actual behavior of these planets just before and just after passing from circulation to libration is only incrementally changed .",
    "this example shows that the classical secular approach is not only accurate in a qualitative sense , reproducing the evolutionary behavior derived by mardling , but it is also surprisingly accurate quantitatively as well . even though secular theory was developed assuming small eccentricities , in this case all of the critical parameters ( oscillation amplitudes , frequencies , relative damping timescales , etc . )",
    "are similar to the values from mardling s solution . obviously , for some purposes , classical secular theory has limited quantitative value",
    ". however , this example shows its value for characterizing the dynamical condition and evolution of a system , even with fairly large @xmath1 values .",
    "moreover , the classical theory has several advantages over mardling s method : unlike her formulation , it can be applied to a system of any number of planets ; it does not require @xmath77 much less than @xmath78 ; it does not require an artificially low @xmath61 value to obtain a solution ; and it gives results in the form of simple analytic expressions that do not need to be numerically integrated .",
    "thus , while not quantitatively precise enough for some applications , the results of classical theory are accurate enough for many purposes .    of course , where a precise prediction of orbital interactions is required , direct numerical integrations are generally the best approach .",
    "however , given the considerable uncertainty in the orbits of most exoplanet systems , the level of precision of numerical integrations for modeling the evolution of a system may be unnecessary .",
    "classical secular theory may provide an analytic approach more commensurate with the actual level of precision of the observations .",
    "moreover , this approach gives insight and a way of intercomparing systems that may not be as evident from numerical integrations of each individual system .",
    "as shown in this paper , classical secular theory is a useful tool that yields descriptive parameters for characterizing planetary systems in ways that can elucidate current dynamical interactions as well as illuminate and constrain the history of a given system .",
    "the method has its limitations of course .",
    "as noted above , numerical integrations can yield far more precise ephemerides , given current orbits . on the other hand , where observations are limited",
    ", the precision of secular theory could be adequate if commensurate with uncertainties in the observed orbits .",
    "the classical theory considered here is also limited by the assumption that there are no significant mean - motion resonances involved .",
    "this constraint will limit its applicability in considerations of long - term evolution , during which any system may well pass through resonant conditions .",
    "another limitation is that classical theory as discussed here ignores all terms in the mutual disturbing functions higher than second order in the eccentricities .",
    "this limitation is significant because many extra - solar planets have large eccentricities , some approaching unity .",
    "however , classical theory is reasonably accurate where eccentricities are modest , and gives qualitatively useful characterizations ( and surprisingly accurate quantitative results ) even for fairly large eccentricities as shown for example in sect .",
    "[ mardling ] .",
    "the examples discussed in this paper illustrate various ways that secular theory can provide insight into the dynamics and histories of planetary systems . in each case , the actual current orbits may prove ( with further observations ) to be different from those we have adopted from the literature .",
    "however , that issue is somewhat tangential to the purpose of this paper , which is to demonstrate the value of the classical approach . for that purpose , even hypothetical systems , like the one from mardling ( 2007)@xcite discussed in sect .",
    "[ mardling ] above or the system considered in an illuminating study by wu and goldreich ( 2002)@xcite , which proved to be non - existent , provide useful demonstrations . as shown here",
    ", classical secular theory can provide insight in several ways .      in each of the systems discussed here , inspection of the relative role of each eigenmode in the behavior of each planet",
    "helps characterize how closely the planets are dynamically linked . at one extreme , if each eigenvector had a significant component for only one planet , the planets would be in effect dynamically isolated , the opposite extreme from a `` packed '' planetary system ( barnes and quinn 2004@xcite ; barnes and raymond 2004@xcite ; raymond and barnes 2005@xcite , raymond et al . 2006@xcite , barnes and greenberg 2006b@xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical groups that can be inferred from the sharing of eigenmodes ( as demonstrated in the cases here ) represent the pathways through which planets can exchange angular momentum .",
    "they are an indication of the degree of planet - planet interaction , and hence of the denseness of planetary packing .",
    "strongly coupled groups imply highly packed systems , and _",
    "vice versa_. where a system divides into separate groups of planets only linked among themselves , there is a dynamical gap with possible implications about the completeness of either planet formation or detection . the fact that most planets considered here are secularly coupled supports the notion that planets tend to form in fairly compact configurations .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen in several cases that subsets of planets are dynamically isolated from others .",
    "one example was the system described by fischer et al.s ( 2008)@xcite solution for 55 cancri which divided into two groups : the inner three planets and the outer two planets .",
    "in contrast , the solutions for the same system by dawson and fabrycky ( 2010)@xcite had only the inner planet relatively uncoupled from the rest . in the case of hip 14810 , the inner two of the three planets are coupled and the outer planet is dynamically alone .",
    "interestingly , the fact that a set of planets are dynamically linked through a common eigenmode does not necessarily mean that they exchange angular momentum . to exchange angular momentum",
    ", the eccentricities of those planets must involve more than one eigenmode so that the contributions from the modes can periodically add constructively and destructively .",
    "for a set of planets whose eccentricities are governed by only one eigenmode ( i.e. where the other modes have zero amplitudes ) , all the eccentricity values would be fixed and there would be no exchange of angular momentum .      if any process acts directly to damp the eccentricity of one planet , secular coupling with the other planets will distribute its effects .",
    "thus the magnitudes of all of the eigenmodes of the system will decrease , indirectly damping the eccentricities of all the planets .",
    "how fast each eigenmode damps reflects how concentrated ( or not ) the eigenvector is in the directly affected planet .",
    "the damping process that has gotten the most attention is tidal dissipation , which acts most strongly on the inner planet in most systems .",
    "tides also affect semi - major axes , which in turn can have an effect on the rates of damping of the various components of each eigenvector , as first shown by wu and goldreich ( 2002)@xcite for a special case and more generally by greenberg and van laerhoven ( 2011)@xcite . here",
    "though we have only considered the effect of eccentricity damping on the inner planet , and shown how the modification of secular interactions can result in indirect damping of all the orbits .    as the damping process proceeds , a stage is reached where all but the longest - lived eigenmode has damped away . in that case , the single remaining eigenmode behavior is characterized by an alignment of the major axes of the system , accompanied by slowly decreasing eccentricities , with each eccentricity damping at a rate proportional to its magnitude ( although this would not be quite true if there were a direct effect changing a planet s semi - major axis ( wu and goldreich 2002@xcite , greenberg and van laerhoven 2011@xcite ) ) .",
    "this condition has been called a `` fixed - point '' solution in the literature , or a `` quasi - fixed - point '' taking into account the slow decrease in the amplitude of the final eigenmode .",
    "the sequential damping of the eigenmodes of he classical secular theory predicts precisely the type of sequence of transitions that was described by mardling ( 2007)@xcite : first circulation of the pericenter longitudes relative to one another , transitioning to a stage of libration about alignment ( or anti - alignment ) , and then the long - lived quasi - fixed - point behavior with the major axes locked in alignment .",
    "the classical theory describes this behavior well , and is surprisingly accurate even when eccentricities might seem to be outside the expected range of validity of the small - eccentricity approximation .",
    "although a system that has undergone considerable direct damping of one ( or more ) planet s eccentricity will generally have an alignment of major axes in the quasi - fixed - point condition , an alignment of major axes does not necessarily imply that damping has taken place .",
    "we have seen several counter examples , such as the 61 virginis case , in which an alignment had been interpreted as an indication of tidal evolution ( vogt et al .",
    "2010a)@xcite , but secular analysis shows that all of the eigenmodes still retain substantial magnitudes so there is no evidence of significant damping .",
    "similarly , in the hip 14810 system , there is libration about alignment of major axes , but even the fastest - damping eigenmode still has a substantial amplitude , so again the libration is apparently unrelated to any eccentricity damping process .    furthermore , current alignment or near alignment of planets lines of apsides do not indicate that those planets are aligned or librating about alignment over the timescales of secular interactions .",
    "examples of such temporary alignment are seen in the 55 cancri system ( as described by dawson and fabrycky s ( 2010)@xcite solution , sect .",
    "[ 55cncd10bf ] ) and the @xmath0 arae system ( sect .  [ muara ] ) . in both those cases",
    "the planets in question are controlled by different modes and the current near alignment is fortuitous .",
    "given the number of systems with aligned major axes that prove not to result from eccentricity damping process , it may be worth investigating other possible causes .",
    "we have seen that such alignments may simply result from initial conditions , with in some cases ( e.g. 61 virginis ) some propensity toward alignment due to the particular semi - major axis values and masses in the system .",
    "however , an alternative explanation may be that there is some as yet unidentified tendency of the orbit - fitting process to introduce such apparent alignments as a systematic error .    while the quasi - fixed - point solution is the expected final stage of the damping process , this may not always be the case .",
    "there is no reason why the damping rates of the longest lived eigenmodes are necessarily very different . in some systems , two or more eigenmodes may damp out on similar timescales , such that there is no single longest - lived mode . in that case",
    ", there would never be a quasi - fixed - state ( i.e. aligned axes ) condition since these eigenmodes will die out together rather than in sequence .",
    "also , if one or more of the outer planets are only weakly coupled to the inner planet then there may be several modes which would not damp appreciably even on timescales as long as the age of the universe or longer .",
    "for example , in the 55 cancri system the 4th and 5th eigenmodes damp much much slower than the other modes and will both therefore persist long term .      secular theory can help determine whether an eccentricity that is determined ( or assumed ) to be small will stay that way over secular timescales .",
    "for example , in the gliese 581 case , the first eigenmode damps on a similar timescale to how the inner planet would have damped if no other planets had been present ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "but at least two other modes affect the inner planet almost as strongly , and they endure for @xmath3850 times longer . as a result ,",
    "the inner planet s eccentricity will persist longer than it would have were it alone in a single planet system .",
    "also in gliese 581 , the subgroup of planets 4 ( g ) and 5 ( d ) means that if planet d has a substantial eccentricity @xmath380.1 ( as seems necessary if planet g exists ( anglada - eschude and dawson 2011@xcite ) ) then planet g must frequently get about that large , in fact likely spending much of its time at even larger values .",
    "thus secular theory can play role in consideration of the habitability of this interesting candidate planet .    as a final example , in dawson and fabrycky s ( 2010)@xcite orbit - fit solution for 55 cancri with @xmath39 held at zero , secular theory allows us to quantify the periodic increase in @xmath39 s value .",
    "we found that the increase was small , so the assumption of small @xmath39 was reasonably self - consistent .",
    "however , because the circular - orbit constraint was motivated by the expectation that the inner planet would have undergone considerable direct damping , a better approach to such a case in the future will be to find a fit in which the shorter - lived eigenmodes have damped away .",
    "such a solution would require new techniques , perhaps an iterative process , but would provide a more well - founded constraint on an orbital fit to account for the likelyhood of past eccentricity damping in a system with such a close - in planet .",
    "classical secular theory has also provided a way to identify the signature of planet - planet scattering that likely has occurred early in the history of planetary systems , and which may play a major role in setting up their current architecture ( rasio and ford 1996@xcite ) .",
    "barnes and greenberg ( 2006a)@xcite ( see barnes and quinn 2004@xcite ) showed that the type of scenario demonstrated by ford and rasio ( 2005)@xcite produces systems whose secular behavior lies near a separatrix between libration and circulation . here",
    "we have pointed out one example ( the system described in sect .",
    "[ 55cncf08 ] ) , but in that case the near - separatrix behavior follows from one planet having a near - circular orbit , which may be an observational artifact . more generally , such systems are very common ( barnes and greenberg ( 2006c@xcite , 2007@xcite ) , so classical secular theory provides a useful tool for identifying systems that may have been influenced by this crucial process .",
    "we conclude that classical secular theory is a powerful tool for interpreting the observed dynamical state of a planetary system .",
    "numerical integration is a much more precise way to simulate the on - going behavior of a system , but each integration represents in a sense an anecdotal case .",
    "analytical theory provides a qualitative characterization and classification that allows interpretation and yields implications for the formation and history of these systems .",
    "classical secular theory thus provides a valuable complement to other approaches to understanding the dynamics of planetary systems .",
    "we thank d. fabrycky , d. hamilton , r. barnes , r. dawson , and b. jackson for their insightful discussions on this topic .",
