    "until now the standard model @xcite of electroweak interactions ( sm ) has passed very successfully all precision experimental tests .",
    "especially intensive have been the studies of the different four - fermion processes between leptons and quarks . in the sm",
    "such reactions are mediated by the electroweak vector bosons .",
    "the large body of experimental data collected at different energy scales ( from practically zero - energy up to the mass of the @xmath1-boson ) confirms that , indeed , four - fermion interactions are mediated by gauge bosons .",
    "nevertheless , there is a widespread belief among theoreticians that the current theory of electroweak interactions is only an effective low - energy limit of a more fundamental theory .",
    "if there is some new dynamics beyond the sm , it might result in some deviations from the sm predictions for four - fermion processes .",
    "for example , standard fermions could take part in processes with the exchange of some non - standard intermediate state .",
    "if the mass of the intermediate particle is larger than the fermi scale , then , at the fermi scale ( and below ) the new interaction can be described by effective four - fermion operators suppressed by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a scale of the order of the mass of the heavy intermediate particle .",
    "obviously one of the most elusive among the non - standard four - fermion interactions is that which involves only neutrinos .",
    "this type of interactions can naturally appear in models with extra neutral gauge bosons or new scalars . here",
    "we will assume simply that this interaction exists without asking about its particular origin .",
    "it is clear that if some `` secret '' neutrino interaction ( sni ) exists , it can only be tested indirectly .",
    "the first studies of possible non - standard @xmath7@xmath7 interactions were performed many years ago @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite different weak processes sensitive to such an interaction were investigated for a sni with pure vector form @xmath8 in particular the sni , which contributes to the decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 , could modify the lepton energy spectra in @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays . from an analysis of these",
    "spectra the following bounds on the coupling @xmath13 were obtained  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the weak fermi constant .",
    "similar bounds were found @xcite from the absence of leptons with `` wrong '' charge in the process @xmath16 .",
    "later on these bounds were improved in a special experiment @xcite searching for the decay @xmath17 . from the negative result of this experiment the following limit",
    "was set : @xmath18    the reason why bounds on the non - standard neutrino interaction coming from low - energy experiments are so loose is evident .",
    "the sni contributes only to the decays with four particles in the final state , and such processes are strongly suppressed by phase space compared with the standard leptonic @xmath19 and @xmath20 decays .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the width of the decay @xmath21 was calculated in the presence of a non - standard @xmath7@xmath7 interaction of the general vector and axial - vector form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the left and right chirality projectors and @xmath26 are real parameters .",
    "the coupling @xmath13 has dimension @xmath27^{-2}$ ] . from the invisible width of the @xmath1-boson , which has been precisely measured at lep , and assuming three generations of light neutrinos and lepton universality ,",
    "the following bounds were obtained @xcite ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 in the case of the @xmath30 structure of the non - standard interaction and @xmath31 for the pure vector case .",
    "as the phase - space suppression is much smaller in the case of the @xmath1-boson decay , these last bounds are much better than those obtained from @xmath19- and @xmath20-meson decays .    taking all previous bounds ,",
    "however , the `` secret '' effective four - neutrino interaction could still be much stronger than the one predicted by the minimal sm@xmath7 interactions was obtained also from astrophysical data@xcite .",
    "the corresponding bounds are weaker than those of eq .",
    "( [ ourbound1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ourbound2 ] ) .",
    "bounds coming from primordial nucleosynthesis can be much stronger @xcite when the four - neutrino interaction involves both left- and right - handed neutrinos . ] , @xmath32 .",
    "all previous bounds are extracted from processes in which the new interaction is the only relevant one and , therefore , observables depend quadratically on @xmath0 .",
    "obviously if the new interaction enters in loop corrections to a sm process , modifications come through its interference with the sm amplitude and , then , the deviations from the sm predictions will depend linearly on the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath7@xmath7 interactions will contribute to the decay @xmath33 at the one - loop level ( see figs .",
    "1a and b ) and consequently to the invisible width of the @xmath1-boson .",
    "it is very simple to estimate the order of magnitude of the corresponding one - loop corrections : @xmath34 as the invisible width of the @xmath1-boson is now measured with an accuracy better than 1% @xcite , one finds the following bound on the non - standard coupling @xmath0 : @xmath35 clearly , from this rough estimate and from our previous discussion one expects stronger bounds on the `` secret '' @xmath7@xmath7 interaction coming from the one - loop analysis than those which follow from its contribution to the invisible width of the @xmath1-boson at tree - level , eq .",
    "( [ ourbound1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ourbound2 ] ) .",
    "the above estimate of the loop effects of the four - neutrino interactions is rather nave , because the one - loop calculation is actually divergent : four - neutrino interactions are not renormalizable .",
    "this does not preclude us obtaining some information on them from loops , as long as the appropriate framework is used to obtain finite non - ambiguous results .",
    "this framework is the effective quantum field theory ( eqft ) @xcite . in this language",
    "all operators allowed by the symmetries of the problem are already present in the effective lagrangian from the beginning , therefore , there always exists a counterterm available to absorb any divergence that could appear in loop calculations .",
    "the number of the effective operators is generally infinite and experimental observables depend on an infinite number of unknown couplings .",
    "however , the effects of higher - dimension operators are suppressed in low - energy processes and one can truncate the lagrangian by keeping only a finite number of operators . using the eqft language one",
    "has a well - defined prescription to calculate loop effects of non - renormalizable operators .",
    "the price that has to be paid is that it is not possible to analyse effects of one operator independently of other operators that mix with it under renormalization . under certain assumptions",
    "one can reduce the basis of operators that mix.the more assumptions one makes the stronger will be the bounds one obtains on the couplings of the effective operators .",
    "the less assumptions one makes the more reliable will be the bounds obtained .",
    "for example , if we want to analyse an operator that contributes to experimental observables at the one - loop level we can use a `` minimal '' set of operators ( which , in general , does not form a closed basis ) that contains the operator in question plus all the operators that mix `` directly '' with it at the one - loop level@xcite .    in this letter",
    "we discuss the procedure of bounding effective operators by considering the case of the four - neutrino contact interaction and obtain constraints on this elusive interaction from the processes in which it contributes at the one - loop level .",
    "we first calculate one - loop corrections to the @xmath1-neutrino coupling due to a sni of the general @xmath37 form given in eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) .",
    "note that interactions mediated by scalars can also be written in this form after a fierz transformation .",
    "the flavour structure could be , however , more general . for simplicity we will only consider the flavour structure of eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown very recently @xcite that four - neutrino interactions that involve both , left - handed and right - handed neutrinos are strongly bounded by cosmological arguments : if these kind of interactions are strong enough they would keep the three right - handed neutrinos in thermal equilibrium at the time of nucleosynthesis , therefore , disturbing it .",
    "but it is important to realise , that nucleosynthesis gives no bound at all if either @xmath38 or @xmath39 are zero in eq .",
    "( [ oi ] ) , because in both cases right - handed neutrinos are completely decoupled .",
    "interactions of only right - handed neutrinos are not interesting , therefore , in the analysis we could restrict ourselves to interactions among only left - handed neutrinos , that is @xmath40 and @xmath41 . however , for the sake of generality we will keep for the moment the two interactions as given by eq .",
    "( [ oi ] ) .",
    "finally we would like to remark that interactions of the form ( [ inter ] ) are not @xmath42 gauge invariant by themselves . to write them in an explicitly gauge invariant form",
    "we would need to include an additional interaction among charged leptons ( and neutrino  leptons as well ) with exactly the same coupling .",
    "but such interactions , at least those involving electrons , are strongly bounded by different experiments . therefore ,",
    "if four - neutrino interactions are part of an @xmath42 gauge invariant interactions they can be bounded indirectly though the bounds on the four - fermion interactions involving charged leptons . on the other hand , the general effective lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) , can be obtained from a gauge - invariant effective lagrangian after spontaneous symmetry breaking . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", however , we could ask how strong four - neutrino interactions can be independently of any additional assumption .",
    "we will use the nave dimensional regularization scheme ( with anticommuting @xmath43 ) .",
    "then , there are two one - loop diagrams , shown in figs .",
    "1a and b , contributing to the @xmath36 vertex .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes are given by @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the four - momentum of the @xmath1-boson , @xmath46 is the cosine of the weak mixing angle , and the summation in @xmath47 runs over the different neutrino - types in the loop ; @xmath48 denotes a dirac spinor , @xmath49 is the wave function of the @xmath1-boson . finally , @xmath50 is the dimensional regularization mass parameter and @xmath51 with @xmath52 the space - time dimension .",
    "both diagrams are divergent .",
    "in dimensional regularization this divergence appears as a simple pole , @xmath53 , in the function @xmath54    in our analysis we will assume lepton universality for the three generations of neutrinos .",
    "then , we can rewrite the sum of @xmath47 and @xmath55 in the form @xmath56 which has been expressed in terms of the renormalized ( scale - dependent ) dimensionless couplings @xmath57 and the following constants @xmath58    as we see , the sni generates , at the one - loop level , a derivative coupling of the @xmath1-boson to neutrinos that is divergent . in order to obtain a finite amplitude for processes involving the @xmath36 vertex",
    ", the effective lagrangian should contain a term able to absorb this divergence in its coupling .",
    "this term can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 ; @xmath61 are the @xmath62 renormalized couplings and the corresponding counterterms are @xmath63    it is important to remark that since we are not assuming @xmath42 invariance for the effective lagrangian , a direct ( non - derivative ) non - standard coupling of the @xmath1 boson to neutrinos is in principle possible .",
    "such a coupling could be generated from a gauge - invariant effective lagrangian after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "although in dimensional regularization and for massless neutrinos it is not needed , there is no symmetry that forbids it .",
    "in fact it will appear naturally if other regularization schemes are used .",
    "therefore , in order to be completely general we will include it in the analysis and will see how it affects our bounds .",
    "this additional interaction has the form @xmath64 the contribution of the operators ( [ ct ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) is schematically shown in fig .",
    "then , the full renormalized @xmath36 vertex will be given by the sum of the three diagrams of fig .  1 :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 here , @xmath67 gives the contribution of the direct non - derivative @xmath1-neutrino interactions .",
    "the running couplings in our approximation ( we neglect all contributions with gauge bosons running in the loops ) are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is some reference scale .",
    "thus , the effective four - neutrino operator at the one - loop level contributes to the running of the coupling of the operator ( [ ct ] ) and we have to consider mixing between at least these two operators , etc . , which also mix with the @xmath1-neutrino coupling ( [ ct ] ) .",
    "but as we are neglecting loops with gauge bosons , they do not mix directly at the one - loop level with the four - neutrino operator and , as they can be strongly bounded from other processes , we will disregard them . ] . the coupling @xmath70 does not mix with the other couplings because it correspond to an operator of different dimension , then @xmath71 .    on the other hand , because the standard @xmath36 coupling only involves left - handed neutrinos , the lowest - order effect of the non - standard vertex eq .",
    "( [ renamp ] ) comes via its interference with the standard coupling and therefore only the real part of the left - handed vertex in eq .",
    "( [ renamp ] ) will be relevant for our analysis .",
    "thus , `` new physics '' depends on three unknown parameters , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , as commented above , couplings to right - handed neutrinos are strongly bounded from cosmological data .    obviously , to put independent bounds on these three parameters in processes which depend only on the induced effective @xmath1-neutrino vertex one needs experimental information obtained at least at three different energy scales .",
    "we would like to note that the behaviour of the three terms is quite different , while the terms proportional to @xmath75 and @xmath76 are also proportional to @xmath77 the @xmath78 term is independent of @xmath77 and can be bounded at very low energies .",
    "in this section we will consider the bounds on the four - neutrino coupling ( and other effective coupligns entering in the @xmath79 vertex ( [ renamp ] ) ) , which follow from neutrino neutral - current experiments .",
    "as we discussed above , in our approximation , the effect of the non - standard operators is taken into account by three renormalized coupling constants @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since physical results are independent from @xmath50 we can freely choose this scale .",
    "we will take @xmath80 as the reference scale and define , for further use , @xmath81    then all our observables will depend on the quantity @xmath82    we will first consider bounds from the precise measurement of the invisible @xmath1-width at lep . from the effective vertex ( [ renamp ] )",
    "we can easily obtain the partial decay width of the @xmath1-boson into two neutrinos .",
    "it can be written in the following form : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the sm contribution ( including radiative corrections ) and @xmath85 contains the effects of the non - standard operators .",
    "at lowest order it comes from the interference of the non - standard amplitude with the sm amplitude and we have @xmath86 where the function @xmath87 is given by eq .",
    "( [ regl ] ) and for @xmath88 it is @xmath89    assuming that there are three generations of neutrinos , the non - standard contribution to the invisible width of the @xmath1-boson is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is given by eq .",
    "( [ dgamnunu ] ) . on the other hand",
    "this quantity can also be expressed as @xmath92 the r.h.s .",
    "( [ dginv ] ) is constructed only from observables measured at lep @xcite : @xmath93 ( we use the combined result from the four lep experiments @xcite ) and the ratio of the neutrino and charged leptons partial widths calculated within the sm @xmath94 the central value of the above quantity corresponds to @xmath95  gev and the small error is due to the variation of the mass of the top quark in the range @xmath96 . using",
    "( [ lepdata ] ) and ( [ smratio ] ) we obtain @xmath97 from this experimental result and from our calculation of the extra contributions to the invisible @xmath1 decay width we obtain @xmath98 it is obvious that from this equation we can not get bounds on all three couplings @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 unless additional assumptions are considered . in equation  ( [ nnbounds ] ) one can consider two situations :    1 .",
    "there are no unnatural cancellations among the three terms @xmath99 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "then each of them can be bounded independently of the others and we obtain : @xmath104 2 .   @xmath105 . in this case",
    "there could be cancellations among the three terms .",
    "however , even if there are cancellations at this particular scale ( @xmath106 ) there will be no cancellations at other scales .",
    "in what follows we will show that , also in the case of cancellations at lep energies , it is still possible to get some interesting bounds on the coupling @xmath100 if additional data obtained at different scales are used .",
    "several types of experiments are sensitive to the neutral current neutrino interactions at different @xmath77 scales .",
    "as the non - standard operators ( [ inter ] ) and ( [ ct ] ) contribute to the derivative @xmath36 coupling and this contribution is proportional to @xmath77 we can get some reasonable additional information on the couplings @xmath100 and @xmath101 only from dis experiments at high energy @xmath107 .",
    "however , the direct @xmath1-neutrino non - derivative interaction , given by @xmath99 , contributes with the same strength to any energy , therefore , it can be bounded also in low - energy experiments , e.g. in the elastic @xmath108electron scattering @xmath109 . since dis experiments are more precise and",
    "are performed at different energy scales , we will mainly use their results in our analysis .",
    "there are several high - precision dis measurements @xcite , cdhs , charm and ccfr .",

    "in our analysis we neglect radiative corrections and parton - model corrections to the non - standard contribution @xmath132 .",
