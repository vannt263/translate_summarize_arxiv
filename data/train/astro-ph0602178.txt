    "the origin of the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray background ( egrb ) is one of the unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "the egrb was first discovered by the _",
    "sas _ 2 satellite ( fichtel , simpson , & thompson 1978 ; thompson & fichtel 1982 ) and subsequently confirmed by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) instrument aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro)_. in the first analysis of the egret data , the flux of the egrb integrated above 100 mev was determined to be @xmath2 photons",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( sreekumar et al . 1998 ) . however , this value is strongly dependent on the modeling of the galactic background , which is dominated by cosmic - ray interactions in the galactic disk and must be subtracted from the background data .",
    "the latest analysis , which used a new model of the galactic background , resulted in a slightly smaller value of the egrb , @xmath6 photons @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( strong et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "egret detected many extragalactic high - energy gamma - ray sources that have been identified as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "most of them fall into the blazar class of agns , and this is the only one extragalactic population confirmed in the third egret catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , constituting about 15% of the egrb flux .",
    "therefore unresolved blazars are the most likely candidate for the origin of the egrb , at least contributing substantially , and this issue has been studied in a number of papers ( padovani et al .",
    "1993 ; stecker , salamon , & malkan 1993 ; salamon & stecker 1994 ; chiang et al .",
    "1995 ; stecker & salamon 1996 ; chiang & mukherjee 1998 ; mcke & pohl 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "several alternative candidates for the egrb components have been proposed , e.g. , intergalactic shocks produced by the formation of large - scale cosmological structures ( loeb & waxman 2000 ; totani & kitayama 2000 ; miniati 2002 ; scharf & mukherjee 2002 ; gabici & blasi 2003 ; keshet et al .",
    "2003 ) , or dark matter annihilation ( oda , totani , & nagashima 2005 and references therein ) . therefore , it is important to determine whether the number of unresolved blazars are enough to account for all of the egrb , but conclusions derived by the earlier studies are somewhat controversial .",
    "stecker & salamon ( 1996 , hereafter ss96 ) estimated the unresolved blazar contribution with basic assumptions that egret blazars are the same population with flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars ( fsrqs ) , and that the gamma - ray and radio luminosities are linearly related .",
    "then they constructed the blazar gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) model from the fsrq radio luminosity function ( rlf ) , and found that blazars can account for 100% of the egrb .",
    "however , their model was not compared with the available redshift distribution of the egret blazars , and hence it was uncertain whether this glf model is statistically consistent with the egret blazar data .",
    "quantitative comparison of glf models to the flux and redshift distributions of the egret blazars was performed by chiang & mukherjee ( 1998 , hereafter cm98 ) , and indeed , they found that the model of ss96 seriously overpredicts the number of low - redshift blazars detectable by the egret .",
    "cm98 then concluded that blazars can account for only 25% of the egrb , based on the glf model consistent with the egret blazar distributions .",
    "photons @xmath3 @xmath4 reported by strong et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . ]",
    "however , the analysis of the glf is not straightforward ; a source of uncertainty is the detectability in the radio band .",
    "most of the egret blazars are identified by finding radio counterparts , and hence they would remain unidentified if their radio counterparts are under the flux limit of radio surveys , even though their gamma - ray flux is above the egret sensitivity limit .",
    "therefore one must estimate the probability of a model blazar having flux greater than the sensitivity limits , not only in the gamma - ray band but also in the radio band .",
    "cm98 introduced this probability in their analysis , but they assumed that there is no correlation between gamma - ray and radio luminosities of blazars .",
    "however , the assumption of no correlation at all over a wide range of gamma - ray and radio luminosities induces some inconsistencies ( see discussion given in stecker & salamon 2001 ) , and it is physically reasonable to expect some level of correlation from the viewpoint of the standard synchrotron - inverse compton model of blazars .",
    "therefore we adopt a new treatment on this issue introducing a reasonable correlation ( see  [ section : radio - id ] for details ) .",
    "mcke & pohl ( 2000 ) approached this issue from the viewpoint of the unification scheme of radio - loud agns , which proposed that blazars are the beamed subclass of fanaroff - riley ( fr ) radio galaxies .",
    "they considered the glf models based on the rlf of fr galaxies , and the flux and redshift distributions of blazars were used to constrain their glf models .",
    "then they concluded that unresolved blazar contributuion to the egrb is 2040% assuming that the blazars extend to the maximum cutoff redshift of @xmath7 , and 4080% for @xmath8 .",
    "however , the identification probability of a blazar , which may affect the estimate of the blazar contribution to the egrb , was not incorporated in their analysis .    to resolve this rather controversial situation ,",
    "in this paper we make a comprehensive study of glf models that are statistically compared with the observed redshift and flux distributions , taking into account a reasonable correlation between gamma - ray and radio flux in a consistent manner with the observed gamma - ray to radio flux ratios .",
    "then we make an estimate of the blazar contribution to the egrb flux , and also estimate the expected number of `` unidentified blazars '' due to the lack of radio detection , which can be compared with the number of high - galactic - latitude unidentified sources in the third egret catalog .",
    "we also make some predictions for the future _ gamma ray large area space telescope _ ( _ glast _ ) observation , and discuss its prospects .",
    "in addition to these new aspects , we also try a new type of the glf evolution model .",
    "the earlier studies treated the cosmological evolution of the blazar glf as a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) or a pure density evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function of agns has been investigated intensively in soft x - ray ( e.g. , miyaji , hasinger , & schmidt 2000 , 2001 ; hasinger , miyaji , & schmidt 2005 ) and hard x - ray ( e.g. , boyle et al .",
    "1998 ; la franca et al .",
    "2002 ; cowie et al .",
    "2003 ; ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) bands , recently .",
    "the former studies are mostly for type 1 agns , while the latter ones are for both type 1 and 2 agns , since soft x - ray emission of type 2 agns is significantly absorbed .",
    "these studies revealed that the overall behavior of the soft x - ray luminosity function ( sxlf ) and hard x - ray luminosity function ( hxlf ) of agns are very similar and best described with a luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) where the peak redshift of density evolution increases with agn luminosity ( miyaji , hasinger , & schmidt 2000 , 2001 ; ueda et al .",
    "2003 ; hasinger , miyaji , & schmidt 2005 ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that the cosmological evolution of the blazar glf may also be expressed by the ldde . in this paper",
    ", we try two kinds of blazar glf model ; one is based on the fsrq rlf ( ple model ) and the other is based on the agn sxlf ( ldde model ) .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows : in  2 , we describe sample definition and formulations for the statistical analyses . in",
    " 3 , we present models of the blazar glf and results of comparison to the egret data . in  4",
    ", we address the prospects for the _ glast _ mission .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in  5 and  6 , respectively . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath9cdm universe with the density parameter @xmath10 , the cosmological constant @xmath11 , and the hubble constant @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath4 @xmath14 .",
    "most of blazars show considerable variability , but it is difficult to incorporate in the statistical analysis of the glf .",
    "therefore we use the mean flux shown in the third egret catalog .",
    "there are some blazars in the egret catalog whose significance of detection is above the egret threshold ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) only in some viewing periods , and their mean significance of detection is under the egret threshold .",
    "we exclude such blazars from our analysis , and use only blazars whose mean significance of detection ( as shown in the catalog ) is above the egret threshold .",
    "there are 46 blazars meeting this selection",
    ".    since the detection limit is sensitively dependent on the location in the sky , we will take it into account in the analysis . in the left panel of figure [ fig : f - latitude ] we plot the egret detection limit for each egret point source , which is calculated from mean flux and mean statistical significance of the detection by using equation ( 1 ) of cm98 , against its galactic latitude ( _ crosses _ ) .",
    "the best - fit relation is also shown ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "because of the variability , this fit may be different from the effective detection threshold for blazars that we have chosen . in order to check this point , in the right panel of figure [ fig : f - latitude ] we plot the mean flux of the egret blazars , comparing them to the obtained detection limit curve .",
    "we see from this figure that most of blazars are above the detection limit curve , and hence it is reasonable to take this curve as the egret detection limit for the 46 blazars used in this paper .",
    "it is difficult to take into account the variety of blazar spectra , and we assume a single universal power - law spectrum for all blazars , with the photon spectral index of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this value is close to the mean of the egret blazars ( @xmath21 , sreekumar et al .",
    "we confirmed that our conclusions in this paper are not seriously affected even if we change the value of this parameter into @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then , the gamma - ray luminosity @xmath24 , which is defined as @xmath25 in erg @xmath4 at 100 mev ( at the restframe ) , is related to the observed photon flux , @xmath26 at @xmath27 100 mev ( in photons @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath28 in the observer s frame ) , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the standard luminosity distance .",
    "then , the observed data that will be used in the statistical analysis is a set of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the observed blazar location in the sky , and the subscript @xmath33 denotes each blazar , running over @xmath34 .",
    "we constrain the model parameters of the blazar glf models by using the maximum likelihood method .",
    "a specified glf model predicts the distribution function of the three quantities , @xmath35 , and the likelihood function @xmath36 is given as ( see , e.g. , loredo & lamb 1989 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the expected number of blazar detections : @xmath39 consider a transformation about the normalization , @xmath40 . by maximizing the likelihood function about @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 , i.e. , the maximum likelihood obtained when the expected number , @xmath43 , becomes equal to @xmath44 . substituting @xmath42 and ignoring constant factors that are not relevant for the likelihood maximization , we find the normalization - free form of the likelihood function : @xmath45 the distribution function can be expressed as @xmath46\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the glf per unit comoving density and unit luminosity",

    "we formulate the probability that a gamma - ray blazar having a gamma - ray flux above the egret detection limit is also detected in the radio band , so that it is identified as an egret blazar . in the left panel of figure [ fig : gamma - radio ]",
    "we show the observed relation between @xmath62 and radio luminosity @xmath63 ( @xmath25 in erg @xmath4 at restframe 2.7 ghz ) of the egret blazars .",
    "the best - fit relation is also shown in the figure ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "here we assumed the photon spectral index of @xmath64 for the k - correction , as a typical index of blazars in the radio band ( mcke et al .",
    "it should be noted that , though the gamma - ray and radio luminosities are apparently well correlated with each other , this is mostly an artifact , coming from the fact that blazars with different distances are detected with a similar flux around the detection limit .",
    "this can easily be understood if we see the correlation plot between observed gamma - ray and radio fluxes , as shown in the right panel of the same figure .",
    "the correlation between gamma - ray and radio emissions of blazars has been investigated and the evidence for this correlation has been presented in many papers ( e.g. , padovani et al .",

    "( 1997 ) claimed that correlation between the gamma - ray and radio luminosities can not be established firmly from the existing data .",
    "this is probably because the correlation is hidden by intrinsic dispersion and the rather narrow dynamic range of observed radio and gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "based on this result , cm98 assumed no correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the dynamic range of luminosity of egret blazars is extending over more than five order of magnitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - radio ] ) . if you assume no correlation between gamma - ray and radio luminosities",
    ", it means that you can not tell which blazar is brighter in the radio band , even if you already know that one blazar is brighter than the other by a factor of @xmath65 . such an assumption is highly unlikely , since it is generally believed that the overall spectra of blazars are made by two different emission processes from the same population of relativistic electrons ; the gamma - ray emission is due to the inverse compton process , while the radio emission is due to the synchrotron process .",
    "therefore , we must introduce some correlation between the gamma - ray and radio luminosities in the analysis .",
    "hence we introduce a linear correlation with log - normal scatter as a simple and phenomenological model , to avoid theoretical uncertainties of more physically motivated models .",
    "then , @xmath66 obeys to the log - normal distribution with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig : g - r_scatter ] shows the distribution of @xmath69 , and the best - fit dispersion is @xmath70 .",
    "then , the probability that a blazar having gamma - ray luminosity @xmath24 at redshift @xmath71 will be identified in radio band can be calculated as the probability that the corresponding radio flux at 2.7 ghz ( at observer s frame ) is greater than the radio detection limit , @xmath72 .",
    "we take @xmath73 jy , since most of the egret blazars have radio fluxes larger than 0.7 jy .",
    "it should be noted that this correlation may be different from the true correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath63 , since the observed correlation has been affected by selection effects .",
    "the ratio of the flux limits in radio and gamma - ray bands ( 0.7 jy at 2.7 ghz and @xmath74 photons @xmath3 @xmath4 above 100 mev , respectively ) is in fact very close to the mean of @xmath69 . in order to check how much our analysis",
    "could be affected by this effect , we calculated the prediction of the @xmath69 distribution that will actually be observed for the egret blazars , from the best - fit models of the blazar glf that will be obtained later in this paper .",
    "we confirmed that the predicted distribution is consistent with the observed one , and this consistency check demonstrates that our analysis is not seriously biased by the selection effect .",
    "though we assumed a simple linear relation , more physically motivated models such as the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model and the external radiation compton ( erc ) model may predict deviation from the exact linear correlation .",
    "however , the above result indicates that the linear correlation is statistically consistent with the data , and we can not derive more detailed conclusions from the current sample .",
    "the future _ glast _ mission may provide better statistics for this issue .",
    "we will discuss about the ssc and erc models in the context of the beaming factor difference in the gamma - ray and radio bands in  [ section : beaming ] .",
    "we can calculate the integrated background photon flux ( @xmath75 mev ) from blazars below the egret detection limit as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the gamma - ray luminosity corresponding to the egret threshold , and @xmath78 is the minimum gamma - ray luminosity of the blazar glf .",
    "this quantity will be compared with the observed egrb , to estimate the contribution from unresolved blazars .",
    "since the minimum gamma - ray luminosity is quite uncertain and has considerable effect on the blazar contribution to the egrb , we consider four values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 erg @xmath4 . for reference , @xmath79 erg @xmath4 is smaller than the minimum gamma - ray luminosity of the egret blazars by a factor of @xmath83 .",
    "we assume @xmath84 , but the predicted egrb flux hardly depends on this parameter , since the number density of agns with a given luminosity decreases with redshift beyond @xmath85 by the estimated evolution of luminosity functions in the radio or x - ray bands , based on which our glf models will be constructed .",
    "in this paper we try two models of the blazar glf , @xmath86 .",
    "the descriptions of these two models and fits to the observed data will be presented below .        for the ple model",
    ", we follow the same procedure proposed by ss96 for constructing the blazar glf model .",
    "they made the basic assumptions that blazars seen by gamma - rays above 100 mev are also seen in radio as fsrqs , and that the gamma - ray and radio luminosities of these objects are linearly related as @xmath87 where the definitions and units are the same as defined in the previous section .",
    "the blazar glf is then derived from the fsrq rlf : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a normalization factor , and @xmath90 is the fsrq rlf .",
    "we use the fsrq rlf derived by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 , hereafter dp90 ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the present - day fsrq rlf , which is characterized by the faint - end slope index @xmath93 , the bright - end slope index @xmath94 , and the break luminosity @xmath95 , given as @xmath96^{\\gamma_1}+ \\left[\\frac{l_r}{l^{\\ast}_r}\\right]^{\\gamma_2}\\right\\}^{-1},\\ ] ] and @xmath97 is the luminosity evolution function given as @xmath98 here , @xmath99 @xmath14 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "since this fsrq rlf was derived for the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe with @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath13 @xmath4 @xmath14 , we multiply @xmath107 by a correction factor @xmath108 and @xmath97 by a correction factor @xmath109 in order to approximately convert to a fsrq rlf for the @xmath9cdm universe , where @xmath110 is the comoving volume element of the universe , and @xmath30 is the luminosity distance . therefore , this model is no longer `` ple '' model in a strict sense , but we take this correction into account to apply the rlf in agreement with the observed data .      in this model , we take @xmath111 and @xmath93 as the two free parameters since they are poorly constrained from observations , and fix the other parameters to the best - fit values shown in  [ section : ple - description ] . for consistency",

    "still , if we take the case of @xmath154 erg @xmath4 , the ldde glf with @xmath155 can marginally explain 100% of the egrb with the parameters within the 68% c.l .",
    "however , such a steep faint - end slope index is not favored from the sxlf ( @xmath140 ) . in the ldde model",
    "the blazar contribution to the egrb is strongly dependent on the minimum gamma - ray luminosity of blazars @xmath78 as well as the faint end slope @xmath93 , since the best - fit faint end slope is @xmath156 .",
    "the number of blazars with flux stronger than @xmath26 can be calculated as @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the gamma - ray luminosity of a blazar at redshift @xmath71 whose photon flux above 100 mev is @xmath26 ( see eq . [ [ eq : luminosity - flux ] ] ) . in the left panel of figure [ fig : count - egrb ] , we show the calculated @xmath159 relation of blazars .",
    "this figure shows that the ss96 , our best - fit ple , and the ldde models predict considerably different numbers of blazars detectable by the _ glast _ ( @xmath160 , 5350 and 3000 , respectively ) , where we have set the _ glast _ sensitivity limit as @xmath161 photons @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "here we used @xmath162 erg @xmath4 , but the dependence of the predicted counts on this parameter is small .",
    "it is remarkable that the ldde model predicts more than three times fewer blazars than the ss96 model .",
    "this is because the ldde model predicts smaller evolution for less luminous blazars , and hence paucity of high-@xmath71 and faint blazars , which have the dominant contribution to the blazar counts at faint flux in the ss96 or our best - fit ple models .",
    "this means that we can constrain different blazar glf models and their cosmological evolution from the number counts of blazars detected by the _",
    "glast _ , even without knowing their redshifts .",
    "we also calculate the predicted counts with the ldde model parameters of @xmath163 , which are within the arrowed region of the 68% c.l . and able to explain 100% of the egrb .",
    "in this case the prediction for the _ glast _ is increased to @xmath164 , but still smaller than those of the ss96 or the best - fit ple model .",
    "how much fraction of the egrb can be resolved by the _ glast _ mission ?",
    "to answer to this question , in the right panel of figure [ fig : count - egrb ] we show the differential flux distribution of gamma - ray blazars multiplied by flux , showing the contribution to the egrb per unit logarithmic flux interval . for the ple model",
    ", we predict that we will see the peak of the contribution to the egrb above the detection limit of the _ glast _ mission , and hence we will resolve a considerable fraction of the egrb into blazars , if unresolved blazars are the major source of the egrb .",
    "the predicted resolvable fraction of the egrb flux by blazars detectable by the _ glast _ ( but under the egret detection limit ) is 33% and 42% for the best - fit ple model and that with @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "the latter model can explain 100% of the egrb by unresolved blazars .",
    "on the ohter hand , the ldde model curves have two peaks of the contribution to the egrb as a function of @xmath26 , because of the complicated nature of the evolution .",
    "we predict that the contribution to the egrb will decrease with decreasing flux , just below the egret sensitivity limit .",
    "the resolvable fraction of the egrb by the _ glast _ is 20% and 26% for the best - fit ldde model and that with @xmath163 , where the latter model can explain 100% of the egrb .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : count - egrb ] , the dominant contribution to the egrb comes from blazars under the _ glast _ detection limit , even if blazars are the dominant source of the egrb .      in figures [ fig : z_dist_glast ] and [ fig : l_dist_glast ]",
    "we show the redshift and luminosity distributions of blazars detectable by the _ glast _ , respectively . it should be noted that only the shapes of distribution should be compared , since the total number has been normalized to the same .",
    "it can be seen that the peak of the redshift distribution in the ldde model occurs at a lower redshift than the best - fit ple or ss96 models . furthermore , both redshift and luminosity distributions of the ldde model are wider than those of the other two models .",
    "though the redshift must be determined for the future _ glast _ blazars , this will provide another important information to discriminate different glf models .",
    "in figures [ fig : cl_contour_ple ] and [ fig : cl_contour_ldde ] we also present the contours of @xmath89 and @xmath125 ( _ dashed lines _ ) .",
    "these parameters are possibly related to a beaming effect and/or duty cycle , and we find @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the best - fit ple and ldde models , respectively .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath89 is not far from the unity , as expected because the glf was constructed from the luminosity function of fsrqs , which are generally believed to be the same population with blazars .",
    "however , the best - fit value @xmath166 is slightly smaller than the unity . in the ssc model ,",
    "this value may be explained if not all fsrqs are sufficiently gamma - ray - loud , or there are more than one components of nonthermal electrons or emission regions having different beaming patterns ( e.g. , lindfors et al .",
    "2005 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the erc model may explain this value of @xmath89 by a single electron component , since the beaming pattern of the erc emission is narrower than that of the synchrotron emission or the ssc emission ( dermer 1995 ) .",
    "the observed flux has an angular dependence @xmath168 for the synchrotron or ssc processes , and @xmath169 for the erc process , where @xmath170 is the doppler factor and @xmath171 is the photon spectral index . here we define @xmath172 as the viewing angle of the observer measured from the jet axis , at which the observed flux is smaller than that for the direction of the jet axis by a factor of @xmath173 .",
    "then , using the lorentz factor @xmath174 and the typical index ( @xmath175 , @xmath64 ) , we find that @xmath176 for the synchrotron emission , while @xmath177 for the erc emission .",
    "therefore @xmath178 is expected in this case , which is moderately close to @xmath166 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the glf in the ldde model is constructed from that of agns selected in the soft x - ray band , most of which are expected to be type 1 agns . since the jet activity is not always observed in agns , it is rather unlikely that all x - ray agns have blazar activity .",
    "then , the interpretation of the small value of @xmath125 is a combination of the duty cycle @xmath179 ( here defined as the fraction of agns having the blazar activity ) and beaming of radiation , i.e. , @xmath180 here , we take the ratio of sxlf to hxlf normalization as the fraction of type 1 agns in all agns , @xmath181 ( hasinger , miyaji , & schmidt 2005 ) . the beaming expected from the estimated lorentz factor of blazars",
    "( @xmath1821020 , e.g. , maraschi & tevecchio 2003 ) is @xmath183 .",
    "the small duty cycle can partially be ascribed to the fraction of radio - loud agns to all agns , @xmath184 ( urry & padovani 1995 ; krolik 1999 ) . comparing this @xmath185 to the inferred @xmath179",
    ", it is indicated that about 1% of radio - loud galaxies have active jets now .",
    "it is not unreasonable , since the jet activity may be sporadic , and radio emission by relic electrons can be kept for a while after the jet activity ceased .      over half of the gamma - ray sources ( 170 of 271 ) detected by the egret",
    "have not been identified as known astronomical objects .",
    "the distribution of these unidentified sources can be accounted for as the sum of the galactic and another isotropic ( likely extragalactic ) component ( mukherjee et al .",
    "1995 ; zel & thompson 1996 ) .",
    "since most of the firmly identified extragalactic sources are blazars , it is widely believed that many of the unidentified extragalactic sources which show high variability are blazars . actually , many researchers have been investigating the unidentified egret sources in various wavelengths to find their counterparts , and some of them , such as 3eg j2016 + 3657 ( mukherjee et al .",
    "2000 ; halpern et al . 2001 ) , 3eg j2006 - 2321 ( wallace et al . 2002 ) , and 3eg j2027 + 3429 ( sguera et al . 2004 ) , have already been identified as blazars .",
    "in addition , the number of blazar candidates in the unidentified sources is now increasing ( e.g. , sowards - emmerd , romani , & michelson 2003 ; bloom et al .",
    "2004 ; wallace , bloom , & lewis 2005 ) .",
    "these ( potential ) blazars were initially classified as unidentified sources likely because of the lack of strong radio emission .",
    "since our model incorporates the dispersion in radio and gamma - ray luminosities and selection by radio flux , we can address this issue by estimating how many `` unidentified blazars '' will be expected due to the lack of detectable radio flux .",
    "we found that this number is 10 and 8 sources at high galactic latitude of @xmath186 for the best - fit ple and ldde models , respectively ( gehrels et al . 2000 ) . ] . in the third egret catalog , there are six low confidence potential blazars and 19 unidentified sources at @xmath186 . the variability of these unidentified sources have been investigated in some papers ( e.g. , gehrels et al . 2000 ; torres , pessah , & romero 2001 ; nolan et al .",
    "2003 ) , and 59 of them are non - variable sources , though definition of `` non - variable '' is different among these papers .",
    "therefore , a substantial fraction of potential blazars and variable unidentified sources at @xmath186 can be explained by blazars with radio flux under the detection limit .",
    "it has been suggested that the apparently steady unidentified sources may be accounted for by forming gamma - ray clusters ( totani & kitayama 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper , we presented a comprehensive study for the gamma - ray luminosity function of blazars .",
    "we introduced a log - normal distribution for the ratio of radio to gamma - ray luminosity , and radio detection was required for the model blazars to become identified sources in the egret catalog .",
    "the number of potential blazars and variable unidentified sources at high galactic latitude in the egret catalog is similar to the number of `` unidentified blazars '' predicted in our model due to the lack of detectable radio flux , indicating that our treatment about gamma - ray blazar identification by radio detection is reasonable .",
    "we newly tried the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model based on recent studies of the x - ray luminosity function of agns , in addition to the pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model used in earlier studies .    by performing the maximum likelihood analysis for the redshift and luminosity distributions of the egret blazars",
    ", we found that the ldde model with the evolutionary parameters inferred from the soft x - ray luminosity function ( sxlf ) of agns can explain the redshift and luminosity distributions of the egret blazars better than the ple model with the evolutionary parameters inferred from the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "this indicates that blazars are evolving similarly to type 1 agns found in the soft x - ray bands , and hence the jet activity is universally correlated with the accretion history of agns .",
    "we also found that the normalization between blazars and type 1 agns is roughly consistent with the unified picture of agns , when the beaming and jet duty cycle are taken into account .",
    "as an implication for the _ glast _ mission , we found that the ldde model predicts considerably fewer ( by a factor of more than 3 ) blazars down to the _ glast _ sensitivity limit , compared with a previous estimate based on the ple luminosity function .",
    "this can be easily tested by the mission , giving us important information for the evolutionary nature of gamma - ray blazars .",
    "redshift and luminosity distributions will further constrain the different models , though redshift measurements are required .",
    "then we examined the contribution of unresolved blazars to the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray background ( egrb ) , which has been controversial topic in earlier works ( 100% in ss96 , 25% in cm98 ) .",
    "we found that only @xmath0@xmath1 of the egrb can be explained with the best - fit ldde model , which is similar to the result of cm98 but by considerably different analysis . on the other hand , according to our statistical analysis and parameter survey , it is possible to account for 100% of the egrb with a steeper faint - end slope of @xmath155 that is marginally consistent with the arrowed region from the likelihood analysis of the egret blazar distributions .",
    "however , such a value is inconsistent with that inferred from the sxlf of agns .",
    "therefore we conclude that unresolved blazars can not account for 100% of the egrb , if the jet activity of agns is universally correlated to the accretion luminosity and hence the agn sxlf is a good description of the blazar luminosity function and its evolution .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty about the extrapolation to high redshift does not change this conclusion , since almost all of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) flux can be explained by the ldde luminosity function ( ueda et al .",
    "it indicates that , if the rest of the egrb is explained by an agn population , it must be a different population from egret blazars , having different evolution from x - ray agns , and not significantly contributing to the cxb .",
    "based on the best - fit ldde model , we predict that the contribution to the egrb by blazars will start to decrease with decreasing flux just below the egret sensitivity limit . in the case of the ldde model with parameters that can explain 100% of the egrb",
    ", there are two peaks of the contribution to the egrb as a function of flux , and the major contribution comes from blazars under the _ glast _ detection limit .",
