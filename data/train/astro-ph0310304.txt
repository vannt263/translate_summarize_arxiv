    "magnetic fields play a crucial role in determining the evolution of many relativistic objects . some of these systems are promising sources of gravitational radiation for detection by laser interferometers now under design and construction , such as ligo , virgo , tama , geo , and lisa .",
    "for example , merging neutron stars can form a differentially rotating `` hypermassive '' remnant ( rasio & shapiro 1992 , 1999 ; baumgarte , shapiro , & shibata 2000 ; shibata & ury 2000 ) .",
    "these configurations have rest masses that exceed both the maximum rest mass of nonrotating spherical stars ( the tov limit ) and uniformly rotating stars at the mass - shedding limit ( `` supramassive stars '' ) , all with the same polytropic index .",
    "this is possible because differentially rotating neutron stars can support significantly more rest mass than their nonrotating or uniformly rotating counterparts .",
    "baumgarte , shapiro & shibata ( 2000 ) , have performed dynamical simulations in full general relativity to demonstrate that hypermassive stars can be constructed that are dynamically stable against radial collapse and nonradial bar formation .",
    "the dynamical stabilization of a hypermassive remnant by differential rotation may lead to delayed collapse and a delayed gravitational wave burst .",
    "the reason is that the stabilization due to differential rotation , although expected to last for many dynamical timescales ( i.e. many milliseconds ) , will ultimately be destroyed by magnetic braking and/or viscosity .",
    "these processes drive the star to uniform rotation , which can not support the excess mass , and will lead to catastrophic collapse , possibly accompanied by some mass  loss .",
    "baumgarte & shapiro ( 2003 ) discuss several other relativistic astrophysical scenarios in which magnetic fields will be important .",
    "neutron stars formed through core collapse supernovae are probably characterized by significant differential rotation ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , zwerger & mller 1997 ; rampp , mller , & ruffert 1998 ; liu & lindblom 2001 ; liu 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "conservation of angular momentum during the collapse is expected to result in a large value of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath2 is the gravitational potential energy .",
    "however , uniform rotation can only support small values of @xmath3 without leading to mass shedding ( shapiro & teukolsky , 1983 ) .",
    "thus , nascent neutron stars from supernovae probably rotate differentially , giving magnetic braking and viscosity an important dynamical role .",
    "short period gamma - ray bursts ( grb s ) are thought to result from binary neutron star mergers ( narayan , paczynski , & piran 1992 ) or tidal disruptions of neutron stars by black holes ( ruffert & janka 1999 ) .",
    "meanwhile , long period grb s are believed to result from collapses of rotating massive stars to form black holes ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . in most current models of grb s ,",
    "the burst is powered by rotational energy extracted from the neutron star , black hole , or surrounding disk ( vlahakis & konigl 2001 ) .",
    "this energy extraction can be accomplished by strong magnetic fields , which also provide an explanation for the collimation of grb outflows into jets ( meszaros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ; piran 2002 ) and for the observed gamma - ray polarization ( coburn & boggs 2003 ) .",
    "the dynamics of supermassive stars ( sms s ) , which may have been present in the early universe , will also depend on magnetic fields if the sms s rotate differentially .",
    "loss of differential rotation support will affect the collapse of sms s , which has been proposed as a formation mechanism for supermassive black holes observed in galaxies and quasars , or their seeds ( see rees 1984 , baumgarte & shapiro 1999 , bromm & loeb 2003 , and shapiro 2003 for discussion and references ) .",
    "finally , the effectiveness of the @xmath4-mode instability in rotating neutron stars may depend on magnetic fields .",
    "this instability has been proposed as a mechanism for limiting the angular velocities of neutron stars and for producing quasi - periodic gravitational waves ( andersson 1998 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ; andersson , kokkotas , & stergioulas 1999 ; lindblom , owen , & morsink 1998 ) . due to",
    "flux - freezing , however , the magnetic fields may distort or suppress the @xmath4-modes ( see rezzolla et al .",
    "2000 , 2001a , b and references  therein ) .    motivated in part by the growing list of important , unsolved problems which involve hydromagnetic effects",
    "in strong - field dynamical spacetimes , shapiro ( 2000 , hereafter paper i ) performed a simple , newtonian , mhd calculation to highlight the importance of magnetic fields in differentially rotating stars . in this model ,",
    "the star is idealized as a differentially rotating infinite cylinder consisting of a homogeneous , incompressible conducting gas in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the magnetic field is taken to be purely radial initially and is allowed to evolve according to the ideal mhd equations .",
    "a constant shear viscosity is also allowed .",
    "note that , though highly idealized , this model allows several important physical effects to be included in a 1 + 1 evolution code , requiring much less computational effort than more realistic 3 + 1 simulations .",
    "paper i presents results for the behavior of differentially rotating cylinders in three physical situations : zero viscosity with a vacuum exterior , nonzero viscosity with a vacuum exterior , and zero viscosity with a tenuous ambient plasma atmosphere . in the first case ,",
    "for which the solution is analytic , the magnetic field gains a toroidal component which oscillates back and forth in a standing alfvn wave pattern .",
    "the angular velocity profile oscillates around a state of uniform rotation , with uniform rotation occurring at times when the azimuthal magnetic field is at its maximum magnitude . at these times",
    ", a significant amount of the rotational energy has been converted to magnetic energy . in the absence of a dissipation mechanism ,",
    "these oscillations continue indefinitely . in the second case ( vacuum exterior with nonzero viscosity ) ,",
    "the oscillations are damped and the cylinder is driven to a permanent state of uniform rotation with a significant fraction of its initial rotational energy having been converted into magnetic energy and finally into heat . in the final case ( zero viscosity with a plasma atmosphere ) ,",
    "alfvn waves are partially transmitted at the surface and carry away significant fractions of the angular momentum and energy of the cylinder . in all of these situations , only the timescale , and not the qualitative outcome , of the dynamical behavior depends on the strength of the initial magnetic field .",
    "thus , even for a small initial seed field , magnetic braking and viscosity eventually drive the cylinders toward uniform  rotation .",
    "the braking of differential rotation by magnetic fields is also currently being studied in a spherical , incompressible neutron star model ( liu & shapiro , in preparation ) .",
    "this calculation treats the slow - rotation , weak - magnetic field case in which @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total magnetic energy .",
    "consequently , the star is spherical to a good approximation and poloidal velocities in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions can be neglected on the timescales of interest .",
    "liu & shapiro solve the mhd equations for the coupled evolution of the angular velocity @xmath9 and the azimuthal magnetic field @xmath10 in both newtonian gravity and general relativity .",
    "the resulting angular velocity and poloidal field profiles often develop rich small - scale structure due to the fact that the eigenfrequencies of @xmath10 vary with location inside the  star .    in many cases ,",
    "the loss of differential rotation support due to magnetic braking is expected to lead to interesting dynamical behavior . in hypermassive stars , magnetic braking",
    "may lead to catastrophic gravitational collapse .",
    "in general , however , one expects a range of radial motions , including oscillations , quasistatic contraction , and ejection of winds .",
    "these behaviors are not present in the results of paper i because of the assumptions of homogeneity and incompressibility . in that case ,",
    "no radial velocities occur as the system evolves away from equilibrium . in the present paper , we explore the effects of compressibility by generalizing the calculations of paper i to newtonian cylindrical polytropes . though other aspects of the present model are again highly idealized , allowing for compressible matter results in a much more realistic spectrum of dynamical behavior , including radial contraction , mass ejection , and shocks . by formulating the problem in 1 + 1 dimensions and working in lagrangian",
    "coordinates , we are able to solve the mhd equations essentially to arbitrary precision . our simulations again serve to identify most of the key physical and numerical parameters , scaling behavior , and competing timescales associated with magnetic braking and differential rotation .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  [ basicmodel ] describes our basic model . in section  [ eqbm ]",
    ", we discuss the structure of equilibrium cylindrical polytropes which serve as initial data for our evolution calculations . in section  [ mhdeqns ]",
    ", we set out the fundamental mhd evolution equations and put them in a convenient nondimensional form .",
    "section  [ results ] describes the results of mhd evolution calculations for several choices of the parameters which serve to illustrate the effects of compressibility and differential rotation .",
    "we discuss the significance of these calculations in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "as discussed in paper i , differential rotation in a spinning star twists up a frozen - in , poloidal magnetic field , creating a very strong toroidal field",
    ". this process will generate alfvn waves , which can redistribute the angular momentum of a star on timescales less than @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the characteristic initial poloidal field .",
    "shear viscosity also redistributes angular momentum . however , molecular viscosity in neutron star matter operates on a typical timescale of @xmath13 in a star of @xmath14 , so it alone is much less effective in bringing the star into uniform rotation than magnetic braking , unless the initial magnetic field is particularly weak .",
    "turbulent viscosity , if it arises , can act more  quickly .",
    "we wish to track the evolution of differential rotation and follow the competition between magnetic braking and viscous damping .",
    "following paper i , we model a spinning star as an infinite , axisymmetric cylinder with a vacuum exterior .",
    "we adopt cylindrical coordinates @xmath15 , with the @xmath16 axis aligned with the rotation axis of the star , and assume translational symmetry in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "we take the magnetic field to have components only in the @xmath8 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "the fluid is assumed to be perfectly conducting everywhere ( the ideal mhd regime ) . in some of our models , we allow for the presence of a constant shear viscosity .",
    "for protoneutron stars with @xmath18 , the coefficient of bulk viscosity , due to the time lag for reestablishing beta equilibrium following a change in density , becomes comparable to the shear viscosity coefficient ( sawyer 1989 ) .",
    "we do not account for bulk viscosity , however , since our models are strongly differentially rotating ( and hence have large amounts of shear ) , while large scale density changes in our evolution calculations occur quasistatically ( see section  [ results ] ) .    to construct initial data for our dynamical simulations ,",
    "we assume a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) : @xmath19 . the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium are then solved with an assumed form for the initial differential rotation law ( discussed in section  [ eqbm ] ) .",
    "we take the @xmath17 component of the magnetic field to be zero initially .",
    "we then evolve the system by numerically integrating the full set of coupled mhd equations .",
    "we allow for heating due to shocks and viscous dissipation during the evolution , and assume a @xmath20law eos , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the specific internal  energy .",
    "here we discuss the initial data for our simulations . we derive the equations for the static case , and then generalize to include rotation and radial magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we derive a virial relation for equilibrium infinite cylindrical stars , discuss the stability of these models to radial perturbations , and construct some numerical  models .",
    "the fundamental equations for a static polytrope are the polytropic  eos @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density , @xmath25 is the pressure , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants , and @xmath28 is the polytropic index , and the equation of hydrostatic  equilibrium @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the newtonian gravitational potential , which satisfies poisson s  equation , @xmath31 note that we will work in units such that @xmath32 . to find @xmath33 , we first define @xmath34 to be the mass per unit length interior to radius @xmath4 .",
    "this  gives @xmath35 integrating equation ( [ poisson ] ) and imposing regularity at the origin  yields @xmath36 differentiating equation  ( [ hydroeq ] ) in cylindrical radius @xmath4 and combining with equation  ( [ poisson ] )  yields @xmath37 this equation can be generalized for infinite planar or spherical geometries through similar arguments .",
    "the result  is @xmath38 where @xmath39 corresponds to planar , cylindrical , and spherical geometry  respectively .",
    "we will make use of a common nondimensionalization of equation ( [ genhydro ] ) to facilitate numerical solutions .",
    "we define nondimensional quantities according  to @xmath40^{1/2 } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the central density .",
    "equation ( [ genhydro ] ) then becomes a _",
    "generalized _ lane - emden  equation , @xmath42 hereafter we will treat @xmath43 ( cylindrical geometry ) .",
    "spherical polytropes were described extensively by chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) ; planar polytropes were constructed by shapiro ( 1980 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions on equation ( [ lane ] ) are easily obtained from physical arguments . from equation ( [ lenondim ] ) , it is evident that @xmath44 .",
    "the condition on @xmath45 is obtained by using the fact that @xmath46 so that equation ( [ mudef ] ) implies @xmath47 as @xmath48 , hence equations ( [ poly ] ) , ( [ hydroeq ] ) , and ( [ gradphi ] ) yield @xmath49 , and hence @xmath50 .",
    "the equations should be integrated from the origin out until @xmath51 , which implies @xmath52 .",
    "this point is the surface of the star and will be denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "this gives the pressure and density profiles for equilibrium configurations .",
    "some analytic solutions to equation ( [ lane ] ) are , for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the bessel function of order  zero .      we will now extend the cylindrical polytrope model to include the effects of rotation .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is modified by a term accounting for centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the result  is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the angular velocity at radius @xmath4 ( the @xmath4-dependence allows for differential rotation ) . performing the same manipulations used to get equation  ( [ hydrofinal ] )",

    "there are two analytic solutions for uniform rotation ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the analytic solutions are for @xmath54 , @xmath65 and for @xmath56 , @xmath66 . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will adopt the following @xmath9  profile @xmath67 , \\label{rotlaw}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the radius of the  star .",

    "\\label{nonrot}\\ ] ] though this rotation law was chosen arbitrarily , it satisfies the boundary condition given below ( eq . [ [ domegabound ] ] ) and has the expected property that @xmath9 decreases monotonically with @xmath4 .",
    "shibata and ury ( 2000 ) found that hypermassive binary merger remnants typically have @xmath71 . slightly modifying our rotation law to satisfy this condition resulted in a set of models qualitatively similar to those discussed below , usually with slightly larger allowed values of @xmath0 . to solve equation ( [ rotle ] ) for rotation profile of equation ( [ nonrot ] ) , we must iterate our solutions to equation ( [ rotle ] ) to identify @xmath53 , the surface radius of our star .",
    "as will be shown later , these equilibrium solutions are also valid for cylinders with radial magnetic fields , so we will use these solutions as initial data for our dynamical evolutions .",
    "we remark how simple it is to construct differentially rotating , infinite cylindrical polytropes , described by ordinary differential equations in one dimension , in comparison to finite rotating stars , which are defined by partial differential equations in two dimensions ( see _ e.g. _ tassoul  1978 ) .",
    "we will use the virial theorem to check the results of our equilibrium calculations and , later on , to test whether a configuration has reached a new equilibrium state following dynamical evolution . with the definitions @xmath72 the virial theorem for an infinite cylindrical equilibrium star  is @xmath73 notice that the numerical coefficients in this equation differ from the analogue for bounded configurations .",
    "( for a derivation , see appendix  [ virial ] . )",
    "also note that as shown in appendix [ virial ] , even if magnetic fields are present , this equation still holds unmodified for equilibrium stars . in our case",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is an arbitrary length in the @xmath76-direction .",
    "we divide each quantity in equation ( [ ints ] ) by @xmath75 to obtain quantities per unit length ( we will continue to use the symbols @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath77 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to all extensive quantities as quantities per unit length in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "these definitions give an identical virial theorem to equation ( [ vir ] ) .",
    "using equations ( [ mudef ] ) and ( [ gradphi ] ) , the definition of @xmath2 can be integrated analytically to  give @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total mass per unit length of the  star .",
    "the virial theorem can be used to find an upper limit on @xmath0 for any equilibrium cylindrical star .",
    "since the pressure is always positive , @xmath77 is positive definite .",
    "similarly , @xmath80 is positive definite , so @xmath2 is negative or @xmath81 . using these facts in equation  ( [ vir ] ) implies that for any equilibrium  star @xmath82    we require our equilibrium solutions to be initially stable to radial perturbations to ensure that we are seeing the secular effects of magnetic fields in the evolution and not a hydrodynamical radial instability . for cylinders ,",
    "the critical @xmath27 for stability is @xmath83 , permitting any @xmath84 ( see appendix [ stability ] ) . for spheres",
    ", however , one needs @xmath85 , which in turn requires @xmath86 .",
    "note that rotation lowers the critical @xmath27 , which does not change the limit on @xmath28 , since any realistic eos allows us to restrict ourselves to @xmath84 .",
    "also note that the presence of a radial magnetic field does not affect this stability analysis , as shown in appendix  [ stability ] .",
    "here we present the results of our equilibrium model calculations .",
    "we write equation ( [ rotle ] ) as a system of two coupled first order ode s and integrate using a fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "below we discuss the comparison with an _ analytic _ roche model for centrally condensed rotating cylinders and give a table of data for cylindrical  polytropes .",
    "the roche model holds for uniformly rotating , centrally condensed , polytropic cylinders .",
    "our discussion is patterned after shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) .",
    "we will show below that this approximate model improves with increasing @xmath28 , as expected .",
    "equation ( [ hydrostead ] ) may be written  as @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "because of the central condensation , near the surface @xmath89  and @xmath90 the specific enthalpy of a polytrope is given  by @xmath91 equation ( [ hydroroche ] ) can now be integrated to  obtain @xmath92 where @xmath26 is an integration constant . since the star is very centrally condensed and equation ( [ moment ] ) holds throughout the envelope , @xmath26 is assumed to be the same as in the nonrotating case .",
    "let @xmath93 be the radius of the nonrotating star . then",
    ", since the enthalpy vanishes at the  surface , @xmath94    a stable rotating star ( _ i.e. _  not shedding mass ) must have a radius @xmath95 such that @xmath96 .",
    "let the effective potential be defined as @xmath97 and let the maximum of the effective potential be @xmath98 .",
    "then using equation ( [ moment ] ) and the fact that @xmath99 has a zero , this stability condition  becomes @xmath100 where @xmath98 is determined by setting @xmath101 ,  giving @xmath102 inserting this value into @xmath98 gives the rotational stability  condition @xmath103 this implies that to avoid mass shedding , the star must  satisfy @xmath104 then in terms of nondimensional variables of the nonrotating star , the stability criterion in the roche approximation  becomes @xmath105 employing equations ( [ gradphi ] ) , ( [ zetadef ] ) , and ( [ omegacond ] ) .",
    "now , we use our code to find the maximum @xmath106 for solutions to equation ( [ rotle ] ) and compare to the roche model results .",

    "poloidal seed magnetic fields and viscosity have important dynamical effects on differentially rotating neutron stars . even for a small seed magnetic field , differential rotation generates toroidal alfvn waves which amplify and drive the star toward uniform rotation .",
    "this magnetic braking process can remove a significant amount of rotational energy from the star and store it in the azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "though it acts on a longer timescale , shear viscosity also drives the star toward uniform rotation . for a hypermassive star supported against collapse by differential rotation , magnetic braking and viscosity can lead ultimately to catastrophic  collapse .",
    "the strength of the differential rotation , the degree of compressibility , and the amount of shear viscosity all affect the response of differentially rotating cylinders to the initial magnetic field .",
    "our calculations have shown very different behavior when @xmath0 is below the upper limit for uniform rotation , @xmath115 , than when it is above this limit .",
    "simulations for @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 show that the cylinders oscillate and either expand or contract slightly to accommodate the effects of magnetic braking and viscous damping .",
    "large changes in the structure are not seen for these cases . for @xmath119 ,",
    "on the other hand , the outer layers are ejected to large radii , while most of the star contracts quasistatically . in a simulation of a relativistic hypermassive star with more realistic geometry",
    ", this behavior would likely correspond to quasistatic contraction leading to catastrophic collapse and escape of some ejected material .",
    "the dynamical behavior is more extreme for models with greater compressibility .",
    "this result is reasonable since softer equations of state allow stronger radial motions .",
    "inclusion of a shear viscosity often moderates the behavior of an evolving model , pacing angular momentum transport and damping the toroidal alfvn waves which arise due to differential rotation .",
    "in particular , the numerical simulations in the rapidly rotating @xmath116 and @xmath117 cases show that the contraction of the core and ejection of the outer shells is milder when a significant shear viscosity is present . our results are summarized in table  3 .",
    "though our model for differentially rotating neutron stars is highly idealized , it accommodates magnetic fields , differential rotation , viscosity , and shocks in a simple , one - dimensional lagrangian mhd scheme .",
    "in addition , we are able to handle the wide disparity between the dynamical timescale and the alfvn and viscous timescales . this disparity will likely prove taxing for relativistic mhd evolution codes since it will be necessary to evolve the system for many dynamical timescales in order to see the effects of the magnetic fields . because the cylindrical geometry of the present calculation greatly simplifies the computational problem ,",
    "this class of numerical models is useful in developing intuition for the physical effects which almost certainly play an important role in nascent neutron stars .",
    "more realistic evolutionary calculations of magnetic braking in neutron stars will serve to further crystallize our understanding of the evolution of differentially rotating neutron stars , including hypermassive stars that may arise through binary merger or core collapse , and may shed light on the physical origins of gravitational wave sources and gamma ray bursts .",
    "several additional physical effects are expected to be important .",
    "for example , shapiro ( paper i ) showed that the presence of an atmosphere outside of the star allows efficient angular momentum loss by partial transmission of alfvn waves at the surface .",
    "this will have important effects on the dynamical behavior of a neutron star relaxing to uniform rotation .",
    "in addition , our treatment does not account for evolution of the magnetic field due to turbulence and convection .",
    "however , even without these additional physical processes , our calculations reveal qualitatively important features of the effects of magnetic braking on the stability of neutron stars .",
    "we hope to continue to pursue these questions through more realistic computational investigations , including the effects of general  relativity .",

    "in this appendix , we closely follow the derivation of the virial theorem in shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) section 7.1 .",
    "we will discuss the inviscid case , because we do not expect viscosity to play a dominant role in equilibrium stars .",
    "we start by dotting the position vector @xmath120 into equation ( [ navier ] ) .",
    "we then multiply through by @xmath24 , integrate over a cylindrical volume of length @xmath75 and radius @xmath68 , and divide by @xmath75 ( we will work with quantities per unit length as we did in section 3.3 ) .",
    "define @xmath1 , @xmath77 , and @xmath2 as in section 3.3 and the moment of inertia per unit length  as @xmath121 the left hand side of equation ( [ navier ] ) then  becomes @xmath122 the gravitational term is @xmath2 .",

    "collecting these results  gives @xmath125 assuming steady - state ( @xmath126 ) gives the virial theorem quoted in equation  ( [ vir ] ) .",
    "in this section , we derive by means of an energy variational calculation the critical polytropic parameter @xmath127 for the stability of a slowly rotating cylinder against radial perturbations , adapting the treatment of stability for ordinary stars given in shapiro and teukolsky ( 1983 ) . because we are considering equilibrium models",

    "the equilibrium mass per unit length @xmath130 is determined by the condition @xmath131 .",
