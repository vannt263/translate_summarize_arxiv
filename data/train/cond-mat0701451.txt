    "the physical phenomenon behind the spin - hall effect ( she)@xcite in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems is the flow of a pure spin current , spin - polarized in a transverse direction , driven by a perpendicular electric field .",
    "its existence is conditioned by the presence of a spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , such as rashba - dresselhaus @xcite in n - type two dimensional systems or the spin - split band structure in @xmath1-type gaas.@xcite    if in clean samples the spin - hall conductivity , @xmath2 , was predicted to have a universal , constant value of @xmath3 , in the presence of disorder the resulting picture was less clear .",
    "it was pointed out that , in 2d infinite systems , in the presence of short range scatterers , the vertex corrections provided the exact compensation to cancel the effect@xcite . moreover",
    ", an argument was made that this cancellation occurs even for infinitesimal disorder potentials@xcite .",
    "these conclusions were challenged by analytic@xcite and numerical calculations@xcite of the spin - hall conductivity in one and two - dimensional finite - size mesoscopic samples , performed within the landauer - b \" uttiker formalism , where it was shown that the effect survives up to a critical disorder strength .    even though the robustness of the spin - hall effect in the presence of disorder seems to have been definitively confirmed by the angle - resolved optical detection of spin polarization at opposite edges of a two dimensional hole layer @xcite , a better understanding of the mechanism by which disorder and system size affect spin transport in systems with spin - orbit interaction warrants further investigation .",
    "we focus therefore on a study of the interplay between the disorder strength , embodied in the electron mean free path @xmath4 , and the spin precession length @xmath0 proportional to the spin - orbit interaction , in determining the spin - transport regime in finite size samples .",
    "such an analysis is especially relevant in two dimensions where , in the absence of any additional interactions , the two lengths are independent of each and along with the fermi energy are the only relevant physical parameters of the system .",
    "the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath0 and the system size , @xmath5 , determines the existence of four distinctive transport regimes .",
    "a semi - classical approximation is appropriate for @xmath6 , when the spin coherence is lost over the length of the sample , while @xmath7 corresponds to a mesoscopic regime . when @xmath8 the electron propagation is ballistic , while for @xmath9 multiple scattering events are assumed and the diffusive regime is present .    in the following analysis",
    ", we use the kubo formula to estimate @xmath2 as a function of system size and disorder in a two - dimensional electron system .",
    "the numerical formalism adopted here represents an extension to the spin - hall problem of the particle - source method , developed by tanaka@xcite .",
    "this algorithm is based on the direct integration of the time dependent schr \" odinger equation and allows the calculation of the matrix elements of the green s functions , linear response functions , or any combinations of green s function and quantum operators in a very efficient way .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the delimitation between the mesoscopic and semiclassical regimes , as reflected by the rapid decline of the spin - hall conductivity , is established by @xmath0 . for system sizes smaller than @xmath0 the spin hall conductivity increases monotonically with the system size , while being weakly affected by disorder .",
    "when @xmath10 , @xmath2 decreases exponentially for any amount of disorder in the system .",
    "this result supports the conclusions of two previous reports by sheng _ et _",
    "@xcite and nomura _ et _ al .",
    "@xcite where it was found that @xmath2 remains finite up to an , unspecified , characteristic length scale and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit for any small amounts of disorder in the system . here",
    ", we identify this length as being determined by the spin - precession length .",
    "our results reflect no qualitative modification of the overall behavior when the system evolves from the ballistic to the diffusive regimes , crossover controlled by the mean free path characteristic lengthscale . for a fixed fermi energy and @xmath0 , the spin - hall conductivity decrease monotonically with disorder for any system size , as the system evolves from diffusive to ballistic regime .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of an electron of momentum @xmath11 and effective mass @xmath12 , is written , in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath13 and the rashba coupling constant @xmath14 , as : @xmath15 the exact diagonalization procedure that can be performed on the hamiltonian in the case of a clean system@xcite , becomes impossible when disorder is included in the form of an additional random scattering term .",
    "it is therefore more convenient , for a numerical analysis , to adopt the tight - binding approximation for the many - body hamiltonian , by employing a local orbital basis associated with a virtual square @xmath16 lattice , of constant @xmath17 . in this model , the many - body hamiltonian ,",

    "since the purpose of this investigation is an analysis of the spin - hall conductivity dependence on system size and disorder , we will apply the kubo formula to large size systems for different values of the disorder potential w. the numerical algorithm that underlies this calculation has been introduced in ref . and represents an extension of the particle - source method combined with tight - binding formalism .",

    "one is interested in finding whether the variation of @xmath2 is dramatically changed by disorder and what is the length scale at which this change occurs . for this ,",
    "the two relevant parameters are the electronic mean free path @xmath4 and the spin - precession length @xmath0 . in a quasi - classical approximation @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the fermi velocity , while @xmath77 is the density of states at the fermi energy measured from the bottom of the band .",
    "the spin - precession length is defined in terms of the rasba coupling constant by @xmath78 .    the electronic mean free path is the lengthscale that separates the ballistic from the diffusive regimes , with a ballistic behavior for system sizes smaller than @xmath4 and diffusive otherwise .",
    "we found that the crossover between these two regime is smooth , without any dramatic changes in the overall behavior of the spin - hall conductivity .",
    "the only observable effect is a decrease of the spin - hall conductivity when disorder increases . for example , when @xmath79 , @xmath80 , while for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , whereas , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_linear_size_all_range ] , the behavior of the spin - hall conductivity remains unchanged .",
    "at the same time , for system sizes below @xmath0 , @xmath2 is always monotonically increasing , reaches a plateau between @xmath0 and @xmath83 , and then decreases for large system sizes , being expected to vanish in the thermodynamic limit , as in refs.@xcite .",
    "the spin - precession length , therefore , is the characteristic lengthscale at which a crossover between the different regimes of the spin - hall conductivity is expected .     for fermi energy @xmath84 and spin - orbit interaction strength @xmath85.,width=288 ]    in the semiclassical regime , a scaling analysis is appropriate .",
    "we find that , for a given fermi energy , the size dependence of the spin - hall conductivity can be very well fitted with a exponential function @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a characteristic length that depends on the disorder strength , being divergent in a clean system . in fig . [",
    "fig : coefficient ] we present the dependence of this characteristic length as function of disorder which follows a power law @xmath88 behavior , with the best fit @xmath89 .",
    "we remark again that the system size where @xmath2 starts to decrease is strongly conditioned by @xmath0 , rather than @xmath4 as can be inferred from the similarities between the behaviors drawn for different values of the disorder for the same @xmath0 . in all our calculations",
    "the decrease in the spin - hall conductivity starts for system sizes @xmath90 regardless of the value of the electronic mean free path .",
    "in this work we study the effect of the spin - precession length scale and of the electronic mean free path on the the spin - hall conductivity in different regimes , by adapting the particle - source algorithm to spin transport in systems with soi in the framework of the the tight - binding approximation . the dependence of @xmath2 on the fermi energy is also investigated .",
    "our main finding is that the spin precession length is the critical length scale for the spin - hall behavior . for a system size",
    "smaller that @xmath0 , the spin - hall conductivity increases even in the presence of disorder , reaches a plateau between @xmath0 and @xmath91 and then in the semiclassical limit , when @xmath10 decreases exponentially . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", @xmath2 is zero for any amount of disorder present in the system .",
