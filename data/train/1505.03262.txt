    "radio spectral lines of @xmath2c isotopic species of various molecules are now detectable with a reasonable observation time , thanks to recent developments of receiver and backend technologies .",
    "so far , spectral lines of @xmath2c isotopic species of abundant molecules , whose main isotopologue ( normal species ) lines are optically thick , have widely been observed to derive the column density of the normal species accurately . in this case , the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio of each species is usually assumed to be the same as the elemental @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio , which is 6070 in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "however , anomalies of the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio for carbon - chain molecules have recently been recognized in nearby cold and dense molecular clouds .",
    "the anomalies include different @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios for different carbon atoms in a single molecular species and significantly high @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios for several carbon - chain molecules in comparison with the elemental @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio .    as for the former anomaly",
    ", @xcite reported the non - equivalent abundances of the three @xmath2c species of hc@xmath0n toward the cold dark cloud tmc-1 ( cyanopolyyne peak ; cp ) .",
    "the abundance of the hcc@xmath2cn is higher than that of h@xmath2cccn and hc@xmath2ccn by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "@xcite also reported a large difference between the @xmath2ccs and c@xmath2cs abundances toward tmc-1 ( cp ) , the ratio of c@xmath2cs/@xmath2ccs being 4.2 .",
    "a similar non - equivalence of the @xmath2c isotopologues of a single molecular species is reported for cch , c@xmath0s , and c@xmath16h @xcite .",
    "it is proposed that these non - equivalent abundances of the @xmath2c species reflect production pathways of each molecule and/or originate from gas phase reactions interchanging the @xmath2c position within a molecule @xcite .",
    "the second anomaly is that the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios of some carbon - chain molecules are significantly higher than the elemental @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio ( 6070 ) in the solar neighborhood , indicating that the @xmath2c isotope is diluted in these molecules .",
    "the most striking result is reported for cch @xcite .",
    "the cch/@xmath2cch and cch / c@xmath2ch ratios are higher than 250 and 170 toward tmc-1 ( cp ) , respectively .",
    "high @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios are also seen in ccs , c@xmath0s , and c@xmath16h .",
    "such a dilution of the @xmath2c isotopic species was theoretically predicted by @xcite , and it was confirmed for some carbon - chain molecules by the above observations . on the other hand , @xcite reported the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios of cs , hnc , and h@xmath1cs to be in the range from 43 to 79 toward tmc-1 ( cp ) , which is close to the elemental @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio . hence , the degree of the @xmath2c dilution seems dependent on molecular species , although its origin is still controversial .",
    "it is therefore important to explore whether the @xmath2c isotope anomalies are seen in other molecules .",
    "furthermore , the above observations were mostly carried out toward tmc-1 ( cp ) , although the anomaly was reported for ccs toward the cold dark cloud l1521e and for cch toward the low - mass star - forming region l1527 . with these in mind , we here report on the observations of the @xmath2c isotopic species of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 toward the low - mass star - forming region l1527 .",
    "c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 is a carbon - chain related molecule , and is known to exist widely in interstellar clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has two kinds of @xmath2c isotopic species , as shown in figure [ structure ] .",
    "the off - axis @xmath2c species ( referred to hereafter as c-@xmath5 ) is statistically favored by a factor of 2 , because there are two equivalent carbon atoms in c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 for @xmath2c substitution for this species .",
    "it was detected in tmc-1 and other sources @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , detection of the on - axis @xmath2c species ( referred to hereafter as c-@xmath17 ) has not been reported in cold clouds as far as we know , although detection of one line was claimed by @xcite toward the galactic center cloud sgr b2 . during the spectral line surveys of l1527 with nobeyama 45 m telescope ( a legacy program of nobeyama radio observatory ) and iram 30 m telescope ( the iram large program asai )",
    ", we detected many spectral lines of the off - axis and on - axis @xmath2c isotopic species as well as those of the main isotopologue .",
    "on the basis of these extensive datasets , we have explored the @xmath2c abundance anomaly of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 in l1527 .",
    "the spectral line survey of the 3 mm band ( 80 ghz to 116 ghz ) was carried out with nobeyama 45 m telescope ( referred to hereafter as nro 45 m ) toward l1527 from 2006 to 2011 , as the legacy project of the nobeyama radio observatory .",
    "transition frequencies and quantum numbers of the observed lines for c-@xmath18 and its @xmath19 species are listed in tables 13 .",
    "the observed position was @xmath20 . in this observation , we used two sis mixer receivers , s80 and s100 , simultaneously in 20062008 and the dual - polarization sideband - separating sis receiver t100h / v @xcite in 20092011 .",
    "the system temperatures varied from 250 to 350 k in 20062008 and from 150 to 250 k in 20092011 .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was checked every @xmath21 hours by observing nearby sio maser sources ( nml - tau , ori - kl ) , and was maintained to be better than 6 .",
    "the intensity scale was calibrated by the chopper - wheel method , and is estimated to be accurate within 20% .",
    "the main - beam efficiency is 0.43 in 20062008 , 0.49 in 2009 , 0.42 in 20102011 , as reported in the nro website .",
    "the beam size is 19   at 86 ghz . in 20062011",
    ", we used a bank of acousto - optical radio spectrometers ( aoss ) whose bandwidth , resolution , and channel spacing are 250 mhz , 250 khz , and 125 khz , respectively . in 2012",
    ", we used a bank of autocorrelators , sam45 , whose bandwidth , resolution , and channel spacing were set to be 500 mhz , 244 khz , and 244 khz , respectively .",
    "the frequency resolution corresponds to @xmath22 km s@xmath23 at 90 ghz .",
    "this resolution is not sufficient , because the typical line width toward this source is from @xmath24 to 0.8 km s@xmath23 .",
    "however , we chose this resolution to cover the whole 3 mm band within the limited observation time .",
    "although the lines are partly frequency - diluted , the integrated intensity is reliable .",
    "a position switching mode with the off - position , @xmath25 , was employed in all the observations .",
    "observations with iram 30 m telescope ( referred to hereafter as iram 30 m ) at pico veleta were performed in several runs between 2012 and 2013 , as part of the asai ( astrochemical surveys at iram ) large program .",
    "the survey covers the spectral bands at 3 mm ( 80112 ghz ) , 2 mm ( 130173 ghz ) , and 1 mm ( 200276 ghz ) .",
    "the beam size is 29 , 17 , and 12   at 86 , 145 , and 210 ghz , respectively , as reported in the iram website .",
    "the wobbler switching mode was employed with a beam throw of 180 .",
    "this amount of the beam throw is enough , because most of the emission comes from the 1520  diameter area around the protostar according to the interferometer observations combined with single - dish observations @xcite .",
    "the frontends were the broad - band emir receivers , and the backends were the fts spectrometers in their 195 khz resolution mode , corresponding to velocity resolutions of 0.210.73 km s@xmath23 .",
    "the antenna temperature ( @xmath26 ) was converted to the main - beam brightness temperature ( @xmath27 ) by dividing by @xmath28 . here ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are beam efficiency and forward efficiency , respectively .",
    "the @xmath28 value is 0.85 , 0.80 , and 0.67 at 86 , 145 , and 210 ghz , respectively .",
    "in the nobeyama observations , we detected 7 lines of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 in the 3 mm band ( table [ n_of_lines ] ) .",
    "later , we further detected 8 , 9 , and 17 lines in the 3 mm , 2 mm , and 1 mm bands in the asai observations .",
    "examples of the observed spectra are shown in figure [ lines ] , along with the best gaussian fit to their profiles . in total ,",
    "41 lines of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 were detected , among which 7 transitions were observed both in the nobeyama and asai observations .",
    "even high excitation lines of @xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath31 , whose upper state energies are as high as 77 k ( 53 cm@xmath23 ) , were detected .",
    "the detected lines are summarized in tables [ normal ] and [ n_of_lines ] , and are also shown in the energy level diagram ( figure [ diagram ] ) .",
    "since c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 has a pair of equivalent h nuclei , the rotational levels are classified into the ortho and para species .",
    "radiative and collisional interconversion between the ortho and the para species is strongly forbidden , and hence , the ortho and the para species behave as different molecular species . in our observations ,",
    "19 and 18 lines are detected for the ortho and para species , respectively , while the remaining 4 lines detected in the 1 mm band are blended lines of the ortho and para species .",
    "in addition to the lines of normal species , we also detected the lines of the @xmath2c isotopic species .",
    "the line parameters of c-@xmath5 and c-@xmath3 species ( figure [ structure ] ) are summarized in tables [ off ] and [ on ] , respectively . for c-@xmath5",
    ", we detected 6 lines in the 3 mm band in the nobeyama observations , and 2 , 4 , and 7 lines in the 3 mm , 2 mm , 1 mm bands , respectively , in the asai observations . in total",
    ", we detected 19 lines for c-@xmath5 , as summarized in tables [ off ] and [ n_of_lines ] .",
    "in contrast to the normal species , c-@xmath5 does not have the ortho and para classification , because the two hydrogen nuclei are no longer equivalent .",
    "for c-@xmath3 , we detected 3 lines in the 3 mm band in the nobeyama observations , and 2 , 1 , and 3 lines in the 3 mm , 2 mm , 1 mm bands , respectively , in the asai observations , as summarized in tables [ on ] and [ n_of_lines ] .",
    "hence , c-@xmath3 is definitively detected , as shown in figure [ lines ] .",
    "this species has the ortho and para states as in the case of the normal species .",
    "it should be noted that c-@xmath5 is statistically favored by a factor of 2 in comparison with c-@xmath3 , because two equivalent carbon atoms are available in c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 for @xmath2c substitution for c - cc@xmath35ch@xmath1 while only one for c-@xmath35ccch@xmath1 ( figure [ structure ] ) .      assuming the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) condition",
    ", we determine the rotation temperatures and the beam - averaged column densities of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 and its @xmath2c species by using the least - squares analysis with the following equations : @xmath36(1-e^{-\\tau}),\\ ] ] and @xmath37\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{e_\\mathrm{u}}{kt_\\mathrm{rot } } \\right)n,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the brightness temperature , @xmath39 the planck constant , @xmath40 the transition frequency , @xmath41 the boltzmann constant , @xmath42 the rotation temperature , @xmath43 the cosmic microwave background temperature , @xmath44 the optical depth , @xmath45 the line strength , @xmath46 the dipole moment , @xmath47 the line width , @xmath48 the partition function , @xmath49 the upper state energy , and @xmath50 the total column density .",
    "the partition function is numerically calculated from energies and degeneracies of the rotational levels , which are taken from the spectroscopy database , cdms @xcite ( see also original spectroscopy references : @xcite . ) .    because the size of the emitting region is comparable to or smaller than the telescope beam size",
    ", the effect of beam dilution has to be taken into account .",
    "this correction for the beam dilution is particularly important in this analysis , because the 1 , 2 and 3 mm data , which result in different beam sizes , are used simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the correction is also necessary for the 3 mm data taken with the two different telescopes .",
    "the correction for the beam dilution is made by dividing the observed intensity by the beam dilution factor @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the source diameter and the antenna beam width ( fwhm ) , respectively .",
    "this correction factor assumes a gaussian beam and a gaussian distribution of the source emission .",
    "the fwhm beam widths are assumed to be @xmath54(ghz ) and @xmath55(ghz ) in arcseconds for nro 45 m and iram 30 m , respectively , on the basis of the beam sizes mentioned in sections 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "@xcite reported that c-@xmath18 is distributed within a diameter of 20003000 au from the protostar , which corresponds to the size of 1520 .",
    "thus , the size of the emitting region is assumed to be 20 .",
    "the intensities of the high excitation lines ( @xmath56 k ) in the 3 mm band observed with nro 45 m are brighter by a factor of 1.32.4 than those observed with iram 30 m , which further supports such a compact distribution . in the least - squares analysis ,",
    "the ortho and para species are treated as different molecules , and the ortho - to - para ratio is taken as a fitting parameter .",
    "this analysis is possible owing to the large dataset of the observed line intensities .",
    "relative weights of the data are determined by the errors of the line parameters including the uncertainty of the intensity calibration ( 20% ) .",
    "the total ( ortho plus para ) column density is derived to be @xmath57 @xmath58 . the ortho - to - para ratio is evaluated to be @xmath59 , which is comparable to the statistical weight of 3 .",
    "this ratio is consistent with the previous report by @xcite ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the rotation temperature is ( @xmath61 ) k , which is lower than that reported for c@xmath16h@xmath1 in l1527 of 12.3 k @xcite .",
    "the errors denote the standard deviation of the fit .",
    "we also estimated the column densities of the two @xmath2c species , c-@xmath3 and c-@xmath5 , by assuming lte condition . the column density and the rotation temperature of c-@xmath3",
    "are evaluated to be @xmath62 @xmath58 and @xmath63 k , respectively , by assuming the same ortho - to - para ratio as the normal species . on the other hand ,",
    "the column density and the excitation temperature of c-@xmath5 are determined to be @xmath64 @xmath58 and @xmath65 k , respectively . the abundance ratio of [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c-@xmath3 ] is thus determined to be @xmath9 , whereas that of [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c-@xmath5 ] is @xmath11 .",
    "[ c-@xmath5 ] represents the total abundance of the c-@xmath5 species without any correction for the statistical factor of 2 ( figure [ structure ] ; section 3.1 ) .",
    "these results are higher than the ratios expected for the condition that @xmath2c is randomly distributed among the three carbon atoms and the elemental abundance ratio of @xmath12c/@xmath2c is 6070 , as shown in table [ ratios ] .",
    "figure [ cmp1 ] shows the residuals in the least - squares fit divided by the uncertainty @xmath66 of each line , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the observed intensity and the best - fit value , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of the intensity @xmath66 for each line is estimated by taking into account the gaussian fitting error of the line profile and the calibration uncertainty .",
    "figure [ cmp1 ] shows a slight systematic residuals in the fit .",
    "intensities of the lines with high and low upper state energies systematically show positive residuals , while those of the lines with moderate upper state energies tend to have negative residuals .",
    "such a systematic trend can also be seen , even if the different source sizes of 15  and 30  are assumed .",
    "this may indicate that the source includes two components having different rotation temperatures .",
    "the physical structure of the source ( i.e. the gradient in the density and the temperature ) may also play a role .",
    "however , the systematic residuals are eliminated by a non - lte analysis described below , and we therefore consider that the systematic residuals mainly originate from imperfection of the lte assumption .",
    "we employ a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) analysis based on the non - lte radiative transfer code radex @xcite for the analysis of the normal species .",
    "if the gas kinetic temperature is assumed to be 25 k @xcite , the h@xmath1 density and the total column density of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 are determined to be @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "even if the gas kinetic temperature is assumed to be 10 k for reference , the total column density of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 does not change very much ( @xmath73 @xmath58 ) .",
    "figure [ cmp2 ] shows the residuals of the fit for the gas kinetic temperature of 25 k , calculated in the same way as in figure [ cmp1 ] .",
    "the systematic errors seen in figure [ cmp1 ] are now eliminated in figure [ cmp2 ] .",
    "although the non - lte analysis is favorable as seen here , the collisional cross sections are not reported for the @xmath2c isotopic species .",
    "hence , we can not determine the abundance ratios of the @xmath2c isotopic species relative to the normal species by using the non - lte analysis .",
    "since the total column density derived from the non - lte analysis only differs from that derived from the lte analysis by 20% , we employ the lte results for discussions of the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 derived from the column densities are summarized in table [ ratios ] .",
    "the averaged @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 is calculated as @xmath74}{[\\mathrm{c\\mathchar`-^{13}ccch_2}]+[\\mathrm{c\\mathchar`-cc^{13}ch_2}]}.\\ ] ] the numerical factor 3 is introduced because three carbon atoms are available for the @xmath2c substitution .",
    "the @xmath75 values are evaluated to be @xmath76 under the lte condition . as shown in table [ ratios ] , the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratios of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 are thus found to be higher than those expected from the interstellar elemental abundance ratio of 6070 @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we have also derived the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio in l1527 by using the @xmath77@xmath78 line data of c@xmath79o and @xmath2c@xmath79o obtained in the asai and nobeyama observations to be @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath75 value obtained above is also higher than this ratio .    in dense molecular clouds ,",
    "the main reservoir of @xmath2c is @xmath2co , which is the most abundant carbon - bearing molecule .",
    "as carbon - chain molecules are produced by reactions starting from c@xmath81 , their @xmath2c species are formed by the reaction from @xmath2c@xmath81 .",
    "although the @xmath2c@xmath81 ion is produced from @xmath2co with the reactions of he@xmath13 , as @xmath82c@xmath81 from @xmath82co , @xmath2c@xmath81 will go back to @xmath2co by the following isotope exchange reaction @xcite : @xmath83 this is the most important reaction for @xmath2c@xmath81 , because the reaction with h@xmath1 is a very slow radiative association .",
    "the electron recombination is also much slower than the reaction with @xmath12co .",
    "this exchange reaction is exothermic , and hence , its backward reaction is slow in cold clouds . then , the @xmath12c@xmath81/@xmath2c@xmath81 ratio tends to be higher in cold clouds .",
    "the @xmath2c species of various molecules produced from @xmath2c@xmath81 thus become less abundant .",
    "this mechanism was initially proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite confirmed this trend by chemical model calculations .",
    "it should be noted that the isotope selective photodissociation , which could cause the @xmath12c/@xmath2c isotope anomaly in photodissociation regions , is not important in our observations , because we are observing a dense part near the protostar .",
    "such a dilution process can occur even in the protostellar envelope of l1527 , whose gas kinetic temperature is 25 k @xcite . in order to verify this , we consider the following relation under the steady - state approximation : @xmath84}{[\\mathrm{^{12}c^{+}}]}=\\frac{k_\\mathrm{b}[\\mathrm{^{13}co}]}{k_\\mathrm{f}[\\mathrm{{}^{12}co}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the rate coefficients of the forward and backward reactions of ( [ exchange ] ) , respectively , and @xmath87 $ ] denotes the abundance of @xmath88 .",
    "these rate coefficients fulfill the following relation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 represents the free energy difference between the right and left hand sides of the reaction ( [ exchange ] ) .",
    "since @xmath91 is evaluated to be 0.2 at 25 k , the dilution process of @xmath2c@xmath81 is barely possible in the warm region of l1527 .",
    "l1527 is a warm - carbon - chain - chemistry source , where ch@xmath16 evaporated from dust grains in the warm ( @xmath92 k ) and the dense part near the protostar triggers efficient production of carbon - chain molecules including c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "ch@xmath16 is thought to be formed by hydrogenation from the neutral carbon atoms depleted onto dust grains in the cold starless core phase and/or the less dense phase .",
    "the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio of the carbon atom is also expected to be larger than the elemental ratio as the @xmath12c@xmath13/@xmath2c@xmath13 ratio , because the neutral carbon atom ( c ) is formed from electron recombination of the carbon ion ( c@xmath13 ) . hence , the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio of ch@xmath16 formed on dust grains would also be higher .",
    "this may also contribute to the dilution of the @xmath2c species of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "as described in the introduction , it is reported that several carbon - chain molecules show the abundance anomaly of the @xmath2c species . for cch , ccs , c@xmath0s , c@xmath16h , and hc@xmath0n ,",
    "the @xmath2c abundances for different carbon atoms in a single molecular species are different from one another . in order to compare the abundance of the two @xmath2c species ( section 3.1 ) , we calculate the @xmath93/[\\mathrm{c\\mathchar`-cc^{13}ch_2}]$ ] ratio",
    "to be @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath2c were randomly substituted for the three carbon atoms , the [ c-@xmath3]/[c-@xmath5 ] ratio would be 0.5 .",
    "hence , the observed ratio indicates that c-@xmath5 exists more favorably than c-@xmath3 .",
    "it has been thought that the main production pathway for c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 is the electron recombination of @xmath94 .",
    "this is because the cyclopropenyl cation @xmath94 is a major ionic species , which is produced by the gas - phase reactions starting from ch@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath94 has three equivalent carbon atoms , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 produced from @xmath94 can not contribute to the abundance anomaly of @xmath2c species .",
    "hence , other reactions have to be considered as the dominant production pathway ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) .",
    "another possible reason for the abundance anomaly of the two @xmath2c species is the exchange reaction between c-@xmath3 and c-@xmath5 , although it is uncertain whether this reaction happens for the closed shell molecule , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "the zero - point vibrational energies of c-@xmath3 and c-@xmath5 are evaluated to be lower than the normal species by 8.74 k and 53.2 k , respectively , by using the molecular constants by @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be possible that c-@xmath5 is enhanced relative to c-@xmath3 , if the exchange reaction is possible . in case of @xmath2cch and c@xmath35ch , the reaction such as @xmath96",
    "is proposed @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to explore whether a similar process is possible for c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that the isotopologue with the lowest zero - point vibrational energy tends to have higher abundances for cch , ccs , and c@xmath0s , although this trend is uncertain for c@xmath16h @xcite . this fact may suggest possible contribution of the position exchange reactions @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies of these reactions as well as chemical model calculations for the @xmath2c species in molecular clouds are awaited .",
    "in this study , we accurately determined the [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c-@xmath3 ] and [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c-@xmath5 ] ratios on the basis of the extensive data of the nobeyama and asai observations .",
    "we found a significant dilution of the @xmath2c species , and a significant difference between the [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c-@xmath3 ] and [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c-@xmath5 ] ratios , even when the statistical factor of 2 for the c-@xmath5 species is taken into account .",
    "this further confirms that the @xmath2c anomaly is an important phenomenon in astrochemistry .",
    "it should be noted that determination of the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio requires accurate determination of the column density of the normal species .",
    "this was indeed possible in this study , where a large number of lines can be used to conduct a fine analysis .",
    "however , this is not always the case . on the other hand",
    ", the anomaly in the @xmath12c/@xmath2c ratio among the different carbon atoms in a single molecule can be studied only by observations of the @xmath2c species , which often emit optically thin lines .",
    "if the cause of the @xmath12c/@xmath2c anomaly in a single molecule is established , it could be a new tracer to understand chemical processes and physical conditions of molecular clouds .",
    "the anomalies of the @xmath2c species found for c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 and other carbon - chain molecules might be related to the @xmath2c anomaly in meteorites @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath12c/@xmath2c anomaly in dust forming regions of agb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mainly contributes to the anomaly in meteorites , the @xmath12c/@xmath2c anomaly in cold molecular clouds may also be responsible .",
    "hence , understanding the abundance anomaly of the @xmath2c species and its evolution in star - forming regions is of particular importance to trace back from our planetary system to its interstellar origins .",
