    "although the jets may be weak during most of the mass build - up ( e.g. martinez - sansgre et al . , 2005 ) , powerful episodes of jet emission may cast their influence beyond the agn s immediate environment ( e.g. rawlings & jarvis , 2004 ) . understanding the relationship between",
    "the star - formation and accretion activity is essential to our understanding of massive galaxy evolution and requires observations of distant radio sources .",
    "high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) have generally been the most useful class of source , since their favourable orientation close to the plane of the sky means the host galaxy s stellar population is not swamped by the strong non - stellar continuum at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths , and ensures the overall spectral energy distribution is not affected by doppler boosting of the synchrotron emission .",

    "unlike the profiles of the heii and civ emission lines , which are consistent with a single gaussian component at @xmath35 , it is clear that the ly@xmath10 emission line profiles measured in our data cubes consist of two components . to investigate this further , we fit the ly@xmath10 emission in 4c  + 72.26  with two gaussian profiles and the results are shown in fig .",

    "the increased redshift to the ne of the continuum peak is due to an increased contribution from the redder velocity component , while the increased velocity dispersion is due to the bluer component ( which dominates the total flux , and is also broader ) being broadest at this location .",

    "the luminosity of the qso component is well constrained by the 1020-@xmath52 m photometry ( observed frame ) , since this wavelength range is redward of the peak of stellar emission , and blueward of the thermal emission from the starburst - heated dust .",
    "demanding that the model qso component ( a median radio - loud qso model from elvis et al . , 1994 ) alone fits the photometry in this region also provides strong constraints on the amount by which it can be extinguished .",
    "the f702w photometry requires @xmath81 or else the qso emission alone will exceed the total flux .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width of the broad h@xmath60 line is 86 , and for this to be consistent ( at the 2@xmath16 level ) with the distribution of local , bright qsos from miller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) requires that at least 41per cent of the @xmath1-band continuum light is from the qso , and this in turn demands @xmath82 .",
    "this relatively narrow window of acceptable extinction values is even smaller if an lmc or milky way extinction law is used , since they are shallower in the ultraviolet and hence a larger visual extinction is needed to produce the required uv attenuation .    with these constraints",
    ", the reddened qso still contributes to the rest - frame ultraviolet emission , and explains why the spectrum is much redder than would be expected for a young stellar population ( section  [ subsec : abslines ] ) .",
    "dey et al .",
    "( 1999 ) noted that the ultraviolet continuum emission in 4c  + 72.26  was unpolarised , consistent with our sed analysis in excluding a dominating scattered qso component at these wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the young stellar population ( which we model with a 30-myr - old simple stellar population from the bc03 models of bruzual & charlot 2003 ) must be unreddened for the overall spectral shape to remain consistent with our gmos observations .",
    "the luminosity of the young stellar component is therefore tightly constrained by the f702w photometry .    as the qso must contribute between 4070per cent of the @xmath1-band continuum light , and the young stellar population only contributes @xmath83per cent , there must be a further component which provides 2050per cent of the continuum light .",
    "since this component must peak at @xmath84 m , we assume it is stellar in origin , and a natural interpretation is a more evolved population of stars .    however , we note that this component alone must have @xmath85 , which places it between 1.1 and 2.1 magnitudes brighter than the polynomial fit to the @xmath1@xmath86 relation of willott et al .",
    "however , we note that this is consistent with the distribution of @xmath87band magnitudes at @xmath88 in jarvis et al .",
    "( 2001 , and more recently those in bryant et al . ,",
    "2009 ) where there appears to be a slight turnover in the @xmath1@xmath86 relation .",
    "furthermore , the typical scatter of 0.6 magnitudes across the whole of the @xmath1@xmath86 diagram and the correlation between host galaxy mass and radio luminosity previously discussed means that it is not unreasonable to observe such a magnitude for this particularly powerful high - redshift radio source .",
    "as the @xmath1@xmath86 relation closely follows the passive evolution of a present - day 3@xmath89 galaxy that formed at a redshift @xmath90 , this stellar component would evolve into a very luminous ( 820@xmath89 ) galaxy by the present epoch , unless it formed more recently .",
    "we , somewhat arbitrarily , use an unreddened 1-gyr - old population , whose age corresponds to @xmath91 .",
    "the mass of these stars required to fit the sed is @xmath92 ( assuming a initial mass function from chabrier , 2003 , and solar metallicity ) , although this is not very sensitive to the assumed age , since younger populations , although they possess an intrinsically smaller mass - to - light ratio , must be reddened in order to maintain the overall shape of the sed .",
    "unfortunately , we lack the detailed spectral coverage in the 12@xmath52 m range to remove the degeneracy between age and extinction for this population , and we can obtain acceptable fits with a range of values , although all require a mass of @xmath93 .",
    "populations with exponentially - declining star formation rates can also fit this population , provided the @xmath94-folding time is less than the age and they are reddened ; an additional unreddened young population is also required , however .    in summary ,",
    "our best - fit spectral energy distribution consists of five components :    * a 30-myr - old simple stellar population from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , with a mass of @xmath95 , * a 1-gyr simple stellar population , also from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , with a mass of @xmath92 , * a median radio - loud qso template from elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) which suffers 1.2 magnitudes of extinction , according to the small magellanic cloud law of pei et al .",
    "( 1992 ) * a warm dust component described by a power - law with an index of two and exponential cutoffs at high and low frequency , * a modified black body with a temperature of 50k and emissivity index @xmath96 ( following the results of seymour et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] that the overall sed is readily split into the ultraviolet / optical / near - infrared regime ( fit by the first three components listed above ) , and the far - infrared region ( fit by the last two components ) , with effectively no cross - talk between these two regimes .",
    "our fit to the far - infrared region is very similar to that of seymour et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , while our fit over the two decades in wavelength from 0.110@xmath52 m is constrained by nine photometric measurements , plus information from our spectroscopy .",
    "we note that our fit significantly underestimates the 16-@xmath52 m flux measured by _",
    "spitzer _ , but the irs spectrum of 4c  + 72.26  clearly shows strong pah emission which is not included in the qso sed ( seymour et al .",
    "the need to include warm dust emission in addition to the qso sed ( whose far - infrared continuum is also produced by thermal dust emission ) indicates a substantial extra heating source , consistent with the massive starburst observed in our gmos spectrum .",
    "finally , we note the good agreement between our estimates of the foreground extinction to the qso derived from the h@xmath60 emission ( @xmath97 ) and the sed ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "redshifts and those of the fourier cross - correlation analysis between the continuum region of 4c  + 72.26  and the ngc1741 template are shown on respective rows , and the locations of the emission lines from our subaru spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : kspec ] are also shown , compared with the co@xmath99 redshift from papadopoulos et al . ,",
    "the error bars correspond to the 1@xmath16 uncertainties based on our data . ]",
    "a comparison of the results of our ly@xmath10 fitting and our fourier cross - correlation of the continuum properties of 4c  + 72.26  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : redshiftcomparison ] .",
    "the redshift of the broad h@xmath60 component is consistent with the redshift of the redder ( background ) starburst , at @xmath100 , and we identify this as the redshift of the radio - loud agn . although both ly@xmath10 emission - line systems are formally consistent with this redshift ( due to the large uncertainties associated with the continuum and broad - line redshifts ) , we identify them as the approaching sides of two bidirectional outflows , with the receding sides hidden by the large - scale dust disc described in section 3.3 .",
    "this asymmetric obscuration can also explain the lack of spatial coincidence between the peaks of the ly@xmath10 and continuum emission .",
    "the more blueshifted of the lyman- components ( @xmath101 ) has a redshift consistent with that measured from the narrow h@xmath10 and [ o  iii ] lines , and also the c  iv and he  ii emission , and the richness of this emission - line spectrum indicates that it is associated with the agn activity .",
    "the less strongly blueshifted ( and narrower ) ly@xmath10 emission - line system ( @xmath102 ) is not associated with any other emission lines and we infer that this is an outflow being driven at a line - of - sight velocity of @xmath103kms@xmath4 by the starburst in the radio galaxy host .",
    "the lower - redshift ( foreground ) starbust ( @xmath104 ) has no detectable line emission associated with it , although we note that around 25%  of starbursting galaxies are not associated with an extended ly@xmath10 halo ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 ) , so this is not especially surprising .",
    "it is clear that the supermassive black hole and most vigorous star - forming region both lie at @xmath105 , while the co(4 - 3 ) emission has a redshift @xmath106 ( papodopoulos et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is formally consistent with the higher redshift starburst . however , it is reasonably common for the molecular gas to end up between two galaxies undergoing collisons ( e.g. zhu et al . , 2007 , and also ivison et al . , 2008 ) , which may explain the slight discrepency",
    "the commonly - proposed scenario of radio jet - induced star formation , which has been proposed for rapidly star - forming radio galaxies , does not appear to be appropriate for 4c  + 72.26 .",
    "we note the lack of similarity between this source and 4c  41.17 , which has been proposed as a jet - induced starburst ( dey et al .",
    "1997 ; bicknell et al .",
    "2000 ) ; that source displays extended ultraviolet emission with morphological similarities to the radio structure , whereas 4c  + 72.26  has a very compact uv continuum ; and the velocity field of 4c  41.17 is disturbed whereas that of 4c  + 72.26  is smooth .",
    "in addition , the analysis in section  [ subsec : abslines ] has clearly demonstrated the presence of two star - forming systems aligned closely to the line of sight , yet the radio jet is not pointing along this axis ; the geometry therefore does not favour the foreground system being influenced by the radio jet and there is no need to demand that the background system is affected in this way .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the jet - induced starburst scenario in the manner of bicknell et al .",
    "we first constrain the velocity of the shock from the fwhm of the emission lines in the high - excitation ( @xmath107 ) spectrum ( 400500kms@xmath4 ) and their blueshift with respect to the assumed systemic velocity ( 460kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "this argues for a much lower velocity shock than in 4c  41.17 , and is supported by the lack of c  iv emission at the nucleus , since such shocks produce very little emission from the precursor ( allen et al .",
    "2008 ) , and almost all the c  iv flux comes from the post - shock region where it can be absorbed by the starburst - driven outflow .",
    "a shock velocity of @xmath108kms@xmath4 produces roughly equal fluxes of c  iv and he  ii , as observed in the halo , and c  iv / c  iii]@xmath23.5 , consistent with the weakness of the c  iii]@xmath109 line ( although this lies in a region strongly affected by night sky lines and therefore we can not measure a reliable flux for it ) . with the caveat about the night sky lines , we can assume with confidence that c  iv / c  iii]@xmath332.0 , and compare these values with the results of bryant et al .",
    "( 2009  their figure 13 ) .",
    "these emission line ratios may readily be explained by photoionisation according to their simple model , and this conclusion is not altered by assuming even considerably weaker c  iii ] emission than our deliberately conservative upper limit .",
    "the absence of vigorous star formation in the halo region could be explained by a much lower gas density , since the time - scale for gravitational instability increases with decreasing density ( equation  9 of bicknell et al .",
    "2000 ; after elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ) , and there may have been insufficient time for them to collapse since the passage of the radio jet .    using the results of allen et al",
    "( 2008 ) and the scaling of dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) , we infer that the total h@xmath60 luminosity of a shock with velocity @xmath110 propagating through a medium of density @xmath111 is @xmath112 . for the specific case of a 300kms@xmath4 shock ,",
    "this produces a he  ii luminosity @xmath113 .    integrating the he  ii flux over a @xmath114arcsec@xmath115 ( @xmath116kpc@xmath115 ) region of the halo",
    "produces a value of @xmath117 .",
    "we note that we are likely to have missed some flux but do not apply any correction to account for this .",
    "the luminosity of this line is @xmath118w , which requires @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the area of the shock in kpc@xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath121 is needed to prevent star - formation on short time - scales , this result is inconsistent with the area over which we have measured the line flux .",
    "similarly , we can consider the situation in 4c  + 72.26 s compact core , where the bulk of the star formation occurs . here",
    ", the observed he  ii luminosity is @xmath122w , although it is certain that significant emission has been lost due to the poor positioning of the ifu .",
    "since the core is @xmath24pc in size , we require a pre - shock density @xmath123@xmath124 .",
    "this would result in a recombination density @xmath125@xmath124 and hence significant suppression of the [ o  iii ] doublet through collisional de - excitation , for which we see no evidence . in truth",
    ", the core density would need to be much higher , since the unresolved core must also include the transition region where the density drops from the high core value to the much lower value in the halo which prevents the collapse of clouds ( and hence star formation ) in the halo region , and the density is unlikely to vary discontinuously",
    ". further analysis would require assumptions about a density profile in the neighbourhood of the core , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "considering these facts , we therefore conclude that jet - induced star formation does not provide a realistic explanation for 4c  + 72.26 .",
    "instead , the kinematics of the two galaxies suggests that there has been a collision , such as that proposed for the @xmath126 source 3c  356 ( simpson & rawlings 2002 ) , that has triggered the agn activity and the star formation .",
    "we finally note that , despite the extreme starburst we are witnessing in 4c  + 72.26 , the rest - frame uv / optical / near - ir spectral energy distribution requires a massive stellar population with an age of a few hundred myr to already be in place .",
    "the massive starbursts found in high - redshift radio galaxies might therefore not be directly related to the major assembly of their stellar mass , but instead due to the presence of a large gas reservoir , absent in lower - redshift systems , within which star formation is induced by a mutual trigger , although jet - induced effects may be important in individual cases such as 4c  41.17 ( bicknell et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "we have analysed new spectroscopy of the @xmath11 ` broad absorption - line radio galaxy ' 4c  + 72.26 , and found it to be associated with a system of two vigorously star - forming galaxies , separated from one another by 1300 @xmath3 200 km  s@xmath4 , and the more active of which hosts the supermassive black hole responsible for the extended radio source .",
    "both galaxies display p  cygni - like absorption line profiles , while the agn host also shows ly@xmath10 emission indicative of a galaxy - wide ` superwind ' ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "2000 ; taniguchi & shioya 2001 ; matsuda et al .  2004 ; smith & jarvis 2007 , smith et al . ,",
    "the agn host is also the source of a luminous , highly - ionized outflow .",
    "we have found tentative evidence for a 40-kpc dust disc , whose size and mass are consistent with being the site of the co emission observed by papadopoulos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . from several lines of argument ,",
    "we have ruled out a jet - induced star - formation scenario for 4c  + 72.26 , and instead proposed that the star formation is caused by a collision between the two galaxies .",
    "the need for an old stellar population suggests that even at @xmath127 we are not witnessing the initial episode of star formation in massive elliptical galaxies .",
