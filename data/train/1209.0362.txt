    "<S> this result invalidates claims that there is no general bound valid for all possible ( unitary and nonunitary ) quantum evolutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that our general bound depends on the quantum fisher information of the system , rather than the initial variance of the hamiltonian of the system alone .    for situations when the general bound is too hard to evaluate , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a more tractable bound , based on a purification procedure that leads to attainable upper bounds for the quantum fisher information .    </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of this bound is exemplified by considering typical nonunitary quantum channels . for the amplitude channel </S>",
    "<S> , it leads to a tight bound , which evidences that the evolution between the initial and final orthogonal pure states is along a geodesic path though mixed states . for a dephasing channel , </S>",
    "<S> it yields very good lower bounds for the minimal evolution time between two non - orthogonal states . for @xmath108-qubit dephasing , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution speed - up due to entanglement of its subsystems , previously demonstrated for unitary evolution , is shown to hold , in the nonunitary case , also for separable states .    </S>",
    "<S> our general result allows the estimation of the impact of the environment on the speed of quantum computation and information processing . </S>",
    "<S> it is also relevant for the estimation of thermalization and decoherence times .    </S>",
