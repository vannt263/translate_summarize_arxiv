    "the notion of the intrinsic charm ( ic ) content of the proton has been introduced about 30 years ago in works @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in the light - cone fock space picture , it is natural to expect a five - quark state contribution of the type @xmath3 to the proton wave function @xcite .",
    "this component can be generated by @xmath4 fluctuations inside the proton where the gluons are coupled to different valence quarks .",
    "the original concept of the charm density in the proton @xcite has nonperturbative nature because the five - quark contribution @xmath3 scales as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-quark mass @xcite .    in the middle of nineties , another point of view on the charm content of the proton",
    "has been proposed in the framework of the variable - flavor - number scheme ( vfns ) of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the vfns is an approach alternative to the traditional fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) of qcd where only light degrees of freedom ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are considered as active . within the vfns",
    ", the mass logarithms of the type @xmath2 are resummed through the all orders in perturbation theory into a heavy quark density which evolves with @xmath10 according to the standard dglap @xcite evolution equation .",
    "hence this approach introduces the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the heavy quarks and changes the number of active flavors by one unit when a heavy quark threshold is crossed . note also that the charm density arises within the vfns perturbatively via the @xmath11 evolution .",
    "some recent developments concerning the vfns are presented in @xcite .",
    "so , the vfns was introduced to resum the mass logarithms and to improve thus the convergence of perturbative qcd series .    at the present time , both nonperturbative and perturbative charm densities are widely used for a phenomenological description of available data .",
    "( a detailed review of the theory and experimental constraints on the charm quark distribution may be found in @xcite ) . in particular , practically all the recent versions of the cteq @xcite and mrst @xcite sets of pdfs are based on the vfn schemes and contain a charm density . at the same time , the key question remains open : how to measure the charm content of the proton ?",
    "the basic theoretical problem is that radiative corrections to the heavy - flavor production cross sections are large : they increase the leading order ( lo ) results by approximately a factor of two .",
    "moreover , soft - gluon resummation of the threshold sudakov logarithms indicates that higher - order contributions can also be substantial ( for reviews , see @xcite . ) on the other hand , perturbative instability leads to a high sensitivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters : the heavy - quark mass , @xmath6 , factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and pdfs .",
    "for this reason , one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for charm production cross sections in the entire energy range from the fixed - target experiments @xcite to the rhic collider @xcite .",
    "since production cross sections are not perturbatively stable within qcd , they can not be a good probe of the charm density in the proton .",
    "for this reason , it is of special interest to study those observables that are well - defined in qcd .",
    "nontrivial examples of such observables were proposed in @xcite , where the azimuthal @xmath1 asymmetry and callan - gross ratio @xmath0 in heavy quark leptoproduction were analyzed ( note also the paper @xcite where the perturbative stability of the qcd predictions for the charge asymmetry in @xmath15-quark hadroproduction has been observed ) .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the production cross sections , the azimuthal asymmetry @xcite and the callan - gross ratio @xcite in heavy flavor leptoproduction are stable within the ffns , both parametrically and perturbatively .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss resummation of the mass logarithms of the type @xmath2 in heavy quark leptoproduction : @xmath16(p_{x } ) .",
    "\\label{1}\\ ] ] the cross section of the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) may be written as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , while the quantity @xmath19 measures the degree of longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon in the breit frame : @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the usual bjorken kinematic variables while the azimuth @xmath24 is defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in next sections",
    ", we will consider resummation of the mass logarithms for the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined as @xmath27",
    "in our analysis , the acot(@xmath30 ) vfns proposed in @xcite is used . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we present the lo and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ffns predictions for the structure function @xmath31 and callan - gross ratio @xmath0 in charm leptoproduction , and compare them with the corresponding acot(@xmath30 ) vfns results . in our calculations ,",
    "the cteq6 m parameterization for pdfs and @xmath32  gev for @xmath7-quark mass is used @xcite .",
    "we convolve the nlo cteq6 m distribution functions with both the lo and nlo partonic cross sections @xcite that makes it possible to estimate directly the degree of stability of the ffns predictions under radiative corrections .",
    "the default common value for the factorization and renormalization scales is @xmath33 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that both the radiative corrections and charm - initiated acot(@xmath30 ) contributions to @xmath31 are large : they increase the lo ffns results by approximately a factor of two at @xmath34 for all @xmath23 . at the same time , the relative difference between the nlo ffns and acot(@xmath30 ) predictions in not large : it does not exceed @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "we conclude that it will be very difficult to determine the charm content of the proton using only data on @xmath37 due to large radiative corrections ( with corresponding theoretical uncertainties ) to this quantity .",
    "considering the corresponding predictions for the ratio @xmath25 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we see that in this case the nlo and charm - initiated acot(@xmath30 ) contributions are strongly different .",
    "in particular , the nlo corrections to @xmath25 are small , less than @xmath38 , for @xmath39@xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that large radiative contributions to the structure functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 cancel each other in the ratio @xmath29 with a good accuracy .    on the other hand , the charm content of the proton",
    "is predicted to be sizeable within the acot(@xmath30 ) scheme which decreases the lo ffns results by about @xmath44 practically for all values of @xmath45 .",
    "the reason for decreasing of @xmath25 within the vfns is that resummation of the mass logarithms has different effects on the structure functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , contrary to the transverse structure function , @xmath46 , the longitudinal one , @xmath47 , does not contain leading mass logarithms of the type @xmath2 at both lo and nlo @xcite .",
    "for this reason , resummation of the @xmath2 logarithms within the acot(@xmath30 ) scheme leads to increasing of the quantity @xmath46 but does not affect the function @xmath47 .",
    "we conclude that , contrary to the the production cross sections , the callan - gross ratio @xmath0 in deep - inelastic leptoproduction of @xmath7-quark could be a good probe of the charm density in the proton .",
    "note that this observation is practically independent of the pdfs we use .",
    "we have verified that the cteq versions @xcite of the pdfs lead to sizeable reduction of the lo ffns predictions for the ratio @xmath25 .    as to the low @xmath48 behavior of the callan - gross ratio , this problem requires resummation of the bfkl @xcite logarithms of the type @xmath49 and will be considered in a forthcoming publication .",
    "fig .  [ fig4 ] shows the acot(@xmath30 ) predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath50 at the following values of variable @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 . for comparison , we plot",
    "also the lo ffns predictions ( solid curves ) .",
    "again , we use the cteq6 m parametrization of pdfs , @xmath55  gev , and @xmath33 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the following properties of the azimuthal asymmetry : the mass logarithms resummation leads to a sizeable decreasing of the lo ffns predictions for the @xmath1-asymmetry . within the acot(@xmath30 ) scheme",
    ", the charm - initiated contribution reduces the ffns results for @xmath56 by about @xmath57@xmath58 at @xmath59@xmath40 .",
    "the origin of this reduction is the same as in the case of @xmath25 : contrary to @xmath60 , the azimuth - dependent structure function @xmath61 is safe in the limit @xmath62 at least at lo .",
    "presently , the exact nlo predictions for the azimuth - dependent structure function @xmath61 are not available",
    ". however , in @xcite the nlo corrections to the @xmath1-asymmetry have been estimated within the so - called soft - gluon approximation at @xmath63 .",
    "( note that soft - gluon approximation is unreliable for high @xmath64 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that soft - gluon corrections to both @xmath61 and @xmath60 are large but cancel each other in their ratio @xmath65 with a good accuracy .",
    "for this reason , it is natural to expect that the azimuthal @xmath1-asymmetry is also a perturbatively stable quantity in wide kinematic range of variables @xmath21 and @xmath10 within the ffns .",
    "we have also analyzed how the vfns predictions for @xmath56 depend on the choice of subtraction prescription .",
    "in particular , the schemes proposed in @xcite have been considered .",
    "we have found that , sufficiently above the production threshold , these subtraction prescriptions also reduce the lo ffns results for the asymmetry by approximately @xmath57@xmath66 .    thus , it is shown that impact of the mass logarithms resummation on the @xmath1-asymmetry is essential at @xmath59@xmath40 and therefore can be tested experimentally .",
    "in the present paper , we compare the structure function @xmath60 , callan - gross ratio @xmath67 , and azimuthal asymmetry @xmath68 in charm leptoproduction as probes of the charm content of the proton .",
    "to estimate the charm - initiated contributions , we used the acot(@xmath30 ) vfns @xcite and several cteq sets of pdfs @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the radiative and charm - initiated corrections indicates that , in a wide kinematic range , both contributions to the structure function @xmath31 have similar @xmath21 and @xmath23 behaviors .",
    "for this reason , will be difficult to estimate the charm content of the proton using only data on @xmath31 .",
    "the situation with using the callan - gross ratio and azimuthal asymmetry looks more promising .",
    "our analysis shows that resummation of the mass logarithms leads to reduction of the born predictions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath57@xmath66 at @xmath59@xmath40 and @xmath64 .",
    "taking into account the perturbative stability of the callan - gross ratio and azimuthal asymmetry within the ffns established in @xcite , we conclude that the charm density in the proton can , in principle , be determined from high-@xmath23 data on @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "concerning the experimental aspects , the quantities @xmath69 and @xmath56 in charm leptoproduction can be measured in future studies at the proposed eic @xcite and lhec @xcite colliders .",
