    "fe - ni alloys show a rich structural phase diagram as a function of composition and temperature and a pronounced magneto - structural coupling .",
    "the latter is most evident in the properties of the invar alloy ( at near 35  at.%  ni ) , which has a near zero thermal expansion coefficient due to magnetic interactions .",
    "@xcite another example of the interplay between structure and magnetism is the divergence of the magnetic spin reorientation transition thickness in fe@xmath4ni@xmath5 thin films on w(110 ) with @xmath6 approaching 0.3 .",

    "therefore , understanding the phase decomposition behaviour of fe - ni alloy films on w(110 ) is important in order to clarify the structural factors contributing to the peculiar magnetic spin reorientation transition ( srt ) of this system .    in general",
    ", it has been difficult to experimentally observe the structural phase separation in bulk fe@xmath4ni@xmath5 near @xmath7 into spatially distinct regions of different composition .",
    "several months of aging at temperatures in the range @xmath8c results in a heterogeneity at a length scale of about 10  nm .",
    "@xcite samples collected from meteorites with a natural treatment at high temperatures and astronomical times show the same phenomenon at the macroscopic scale .",
    "@xcite to speed up the phase separation process , vacancies were introduced via ion bombardment in order to enhance diffusion and rearrangement in the bulk ,  @xcite with direct consequences for the magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite    even in the absence of such conditions that favor phase separation , the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in the invar alloy after annealing and a subsequent increase in the curie temperature have been reported .",
    "@xcite similarly , the in - plane to in - plane srt in fe@xmath4ni@xmath5 thin films on w(110 ) has been previously discussed in the context of a homogeneous strain within the fe lattice induced by randomly distributed ni atoms ,  @xcite which does not give any explanation for the observed divergence of the reorientation thickness at @xmath7 . along these lines , understanding the formation and energetics of heterogeneities in fe - ni alloys and alloy films is a prerequisite in discussing the physics involved both in the invar effect and in the fe - ni / w(110 ) srt .    at the limit of ultrathin films , the presence and the nature of phase separation",
    "was addressed in a recent work on a fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 monolayer on w(110 ) .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the alloy monolayer decomposes into bcc ( pseudomorphic ) and fcc - like ( hexagonal ) monolayer regions .",
    "the ni content in the bcc and fcc - like regions were measured to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these compositions are similar to the bulk phase boundaries of fe - ni , though somewhat shifted towards higher fe content . nevertheless , the observation of the fcc - like hexagonal layer on the bcc(110 ) substrate even at the monolayer limit is important given that the srt in fe films on w(110 ) is reported to originate at the interface layer .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we focus on the fcc - bcc coexistence in thicker fe@xmath4ni@xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) films on w(110 ) at a thickness range closer to the spin reorientation transition .",
    "we show that the phase separation occurs upon annealing a few - nanometers thick alloy film to about 300@xmath11c , and the micron - sized structural domains feature different compositions in agreement with the boundaries of the metastability region in the bulk phase diagram .",
    "the observed crystal restructuring requires defect formation ( vacancy or interstitial ) , whereas the chemical heterogeneity calls for the diffusion of the alloy species .",
    "the high interstitial formation energy above 3  ev for bcc fe  @xcite makes it unlikely at the temperatures considered , which leaves vacancy formation as the more likely driving factor of the observed restructuring . based on this",

    "it will be demonstrated that the experimentally - determined energy barrier of 1.59@xmath30.09  ev associated to the phase separation kinetics matches well with the calculations on the vacancy formation .    in the following sections , we begin by describing the experimental details and theoretical methods .",
    "we then present the experimental results on the phase separation in fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 films at high temperature and the chemical and structural characterization of the resulting heterogeneous surface .",
    "the results of our dft calculations on the vacancy formation energy and surface diffusion barrier are reported in section iv , followed by a discussion of the energetics involved in the phase separation process .",

    ", the photon energy was varied from 250  ev to 650  ev in order to tune the inelastic mean free path of electrons and thus to evaluate the variation of the composition along the surface normal . in the latter , the probing depth is several nanometers due to the large mean free path of the secondary photoelectrons .",
    "the w(110 ) substrate was cleaned with cycles of annealing in oxygen ( typically 1100  @xmath16c at @xmath17  mbar o@xmath18 for about 15  minutes in a preparation chamber attached to the microscope ) followed by high temperature flashes ( to above 2000  @xmath16c ) in uhv to remove surface oxygen .",

    "the surface remains homogeneous with a uniform change in electron reflectivity due to a progressive flattening / ordering of the surface .",

    "these grow slowly at low temperature and faster at higher temperature . experiments for different film stoichiometries",

    "however , the measured aspect ratio of the islands is near 2 , which describes a more anisotropic shape than what is expected from surface diffusion alone .",
    "we tentatively attribute the island shape to ( at least in part ) the boundary energy between the fcc and bcc domains .",
    "the leed pattern of such a heterogeneous surface is the superposition of two ( @xmath42 ) unit cells as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : characterize]a .",
    "one of the two corresponds to the symmetry of a bcc(110 ) surface , with the lattice constant very close to that of a fe(110 ) surface . using the w substrate lattice as a reference ,",
    "the lattice constant of this bcc pattern is very slightly smaller ( by 0.5% ) than that of fe(110 ) .",
    "the other leed pattern represents a hexagonal structure and has a lattice vector expanded by 2.2%   with respect to the ni fcc(111 ) unit cell .",
    "dark - field leem images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : characterize]b ) indicate that the hexagonal pattern originates from the islands whereas the rest of the film has the bcc(110 ) structure . in order to better understand the structure of the islands , the energy dependent electron reflectivity curves for the two regions",

    "[ fig : characterize]c .",
    "the islands show a characteristic double peak i(v ) spectrum at around the first bragg energy , which is very similar to the i(v ) curve of the clean ni(111 ) surface .",
    "@xcite therefore , based on the hexagonal kinematic leed pattern and the energy dependence of electron reflectivity , we conclude that the islands have the fcc structure .        a careful inspection of the leem i(v ) data reveals that thickness - dependent intensity oscillations are not uniform over the surface .",
    "[ fig : characterize]d displays the intensity derivative versus out - of - plane momentum transfer , in which the regular quantum oscillations are evident .",
    "the film thickness is directly related to these oscillations ,  @xcite with thicker films resulting in a shorter period and a smaller amplitude due to reflectivity attenuation effects induced by the limited electron mean free path .",
    "thus , the thickness can be laterally mapped from the local i(v ) spectra , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : characterize]e .",
    "the large fcc islands are thicker than the bcc regions by about 15%  on average , although they also feature regions with reduced thickness .",

    "importantly , the variations in the thickness point to a mechanism involving mass transport over distances above a micron .",
    "moreover , the well - defined quantum oscillations in electron reflectivity show that the structure is homogeneous along the entire film depth both in the bcc and fcc regions .",
    "the question arises to the chemical composition of the structurally heterogeneous surface as revealed by leem .",
    "laterally resolved fe and ni distributions are displayed in the xas - peem images in fig .",
    "[ fig : xpeem]a and b , respectively .",
    "the chemical maps are given by the secondary photoelectron images obtained at photon energies around the l@xmath44 x - ray absorption threshold of the respective element .",
    "more precisely , the image acquired with a photon energy at the center of resonance ( resonant image ) is normalized to that acquired at a photon energy several ev below the resonance ( baseline image ) .",
    "in such a normalized xas - peem image , a value of unity corresponds to the absence of the respective element . using the average composition ( @xmath40 ) and the area coverage of the two phases as input",
    ", the lateral map of the fe@xmath4ni@xmath5 alloy stoichiometry ( @xmath6 ) can be obtained from the x - ray intensity images , as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : xpeem]c shows that i ) there is a clear composition difference between the two phases , and ii ) the composition is nearly independent of the thickness variations .",
    "quantitatively , we can assign @xmath45 and @xmath46 to the bcc and fcc phases , respectively .",
    "the pronounced variation in the composition is a direct proof that the bcc - fcc phase separation is not due to a local or martensitic structural transformation but instead it involves considerable mass transport .    beyond determining the compositions ,",
    "the xpeem images show a qualitative difference between fe and ni distributions .",
    "apart from the variations correlated to film thickness , the fe signal is rather uniform everywhere on the surface . instead , the fcc islands have more than a twice stronger ni signal compared to the bcc film .",
    "we note that the xas data displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : xpeem]a and [ fig : xpeem]b reflect the total fe and ni amounts , respectively , along the film normal due to the relatively long mean free path of the secondary photoelectrons .",
    "therefore , these observations suggest that the chemical heterogeneity is formed by ni mass transport laterally across the film , whereas fe mostly remains in place .",
    "the fact that the fcc islands are thicker than the nominal film thickness confirm this statement .",
    "however , the quantitative difference in thickness between the fcc and bcc regions is not sufficient to rule out lateral fe diffusion .",
    "we have also acquired x - ray photoemission spectra at the fe 3p and ni 3p core levels for a different nominal alloy composition ( shown in the supplementary material ) .",
    "importantly , the compositions extracted from the laterally - resolved xps data are dependent on the photon energy .",
    "in particular , both phases appear more ni rich at energies with shorter electron inelastic mean free path , indicating that the surface is enriched in ni .",
    "finally , we note that the fcc - bcc coexistence was observed in the entire composition range under study ( @xmath38 to @xmath47 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the same behaviour was observed in all experiments .",
    "importantly , at the highest ni content considered ( @xmath39 ) the fcc structure was present already after the room temperature growth and before annealing .",
    "moreover , the length scale at which the fcc - bcc separation takes place was observed to be considerably shorter . at compositions below @xmath38 ,",
    "the bcc phase was stable up to the dewetting temperature of the film , which is at around 400@xmath11c for the thicknesses considered .",

    "[ fig : kinetics ] .",
    "firstly , we observe that the island coverage tends to a certain value for the given nominal composition , and that there is a variation in the growth of individual islands .",
    "the latter is evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]a , in which the growth of the fcc island labeled ` 2 ' seems impeded by the growth of the larger islands nearby .",
    "this is consistent with material exchange over long distances , which causes a competition between nearby islands in capturing material .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]b shows a plot of the fractional fcc island coverage as a function of time at constant temperature ( 340@xmath11c ) .",
    "notably , the time dependence is reproduced reasonably well with a single exponential function .",
    "similar experiments at different temperatures show that the time constant has an arrhenius behaviour .",
    "in other words , the temperature - dependence of the dynamics suggests the presence of an energy barrier of @xmath48  ev .",
    "the final fcc coverage is 25%  for the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics ] .",
    "other measurements qualitatively indicate that this value depends on the nominal composition , with higher ni content favoring the abundance of the fcc structure .",
    ", the temperature is increased from below 200@xmath11c to 340@xmath11c and is kept constant afterwards .",
    "the inset shows the time constant of the exponential fit vs inverse temperature obtained from a series of similar experiments at varying temperatures .",
    "the small abrupt variations in the measured island coverage is due to readjustments of the objective focus , which slowly drifts at high temperature.,width=302 ]    although the single exponential function approximately represents the entire time scale , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]b show a faster rise immediately after nucleation and a longer tail at later stages of island growth .",
    "this is an indication that there is more than one energy barrier contributing to the relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "therefore , we consider the more general case , in which there is a distribution of barriers .",
    "the excellent fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]b shows that the time evolution can be represented by a stretched exponential function ,  @xcite which is often applied to relaxation in disordered systems .",
    "the stretched exponential is described by a time dependence in the form @xmath49 .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 is found to be 0.70 for the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics]b .    the unitless quantity @xmath50 carries information on the distribution of energy barriers .",
    "@xcite in particular , the width of the barrier distribution scales as @xmath51 . taking a gaussian barrier distribution , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is found to be about 0.17  ev for @xmath52 . in order to give a physical sense to this energy barrier distribution , in the following section we will present the results of dft calculations for the energy parameters associated with the bcc @xmath35 alloy .",
    "in figure  [ fig : vac_en]a we show an example of the calculated vacancy formation energy ( vfe ) for the fe@xmath53ni@xmath54 alloy . it is given as a function of the chemical potential difference between the alloy and the elemental bulk phases , shown for fe and ni respectively on the bottom and top horizontal axes .",
    "the maximum range of the chemical potential differences are derived from the calculated formation enthalpy , which is @xmath55  ev / atom for the particular supercell in figure  [ fig : vac_en]a . as can be seen",
    ", the vacancy formation energy depends only weakly on the chemical potential .",
    "moreover , this dependence is identical for all the calculations performed ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , in the following we will use the values of vacancy formation energies for the fe chemical potential equal to the bulk fe chemical potential .        in order to account for a possible influence of the immediate environment of the vacancy",
    ", we have performed calculations keeping track of the number of ni atoms near the vacancy . in particular , the stoichiometry and the randomness of the vacancy and ni positions are taken into account in dividing the total of 14 calculations according to the number of first ni neighbours into groups of 5 calculated configurations with 2 first ni neighbors , 4 with 3 , 3 with 4 , and 2 with a single first ni neighbor .",
    "this choice roughly corresponds to the weights  @xcite each number of neighbors has in a random fe@xmath53ni@xmath54 alloy .",
    "note that we have not considered vacancy configurations with 5 to 8 ni neighbours , as they have a negligible contribution at this stoichiometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : vac_en]b presents a histogram of the resulting vacancy formation energies .",
    "the histogram can be roughly described by a gaussian distribution centered around 1.71  ev with a fwhm deviation of 0.37  ev .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the very recent results obtained using kinetic monte carlo calculations , which reported a range of vacancy formation energies between 1.2  ev and 2.15  ev for fe@xmath56ni@xmath56 .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ fig : vac_en]c shows the vacancy formation energy as a function of the total number of ni neighbors in the first two shells . from the clear correlation , it can be inferred that the vacancy formation energy is reduced for configurations with increasing number of ni neighbors .",
    "this is in line with our observation that the ni atoms , constrained in the bcc environment , relax significantly more than the fe atoms around the vacancy , and , in consequence , tend to reduce the vacancy formation energy .",
    "we note that the strongest ni relaxations occur when more ni atoms are grouped together rather than sitting on scattered sites around the vacancy .",
    "the tendency towards a value somewhat above 2  ev / vacancy in the absence of ni neighbours can be seen in figure  [ fig : vac_en]c .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical vacancy formation energy of 2.2  ev in pure fe .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , we also encounter differences in the vacancy energy for equivalent configurations of ni neighbours near the vacancy within different supercells .",
    "we attribute such differences to long range elastic interactions , which depend on the entire supercell configuration .",
    "lastly , we also calculate the diffusion barrier for a ni adatom on the bcc alloy surface .",
    "we focus on the surface diffusion of ni adatoms because of the experimental observation that the surface is enriched in ni , as reported in the previous section .",
    "the lowest energy path is found to be along the direction connecting the long - bridge site ( the global energy minimum ) and the short - bridge site , i.e. along the @xmath57 $ ] direction .",
    "the diffusion barrier is calculated to be 0.34  ev .",
    "this value compares well with the calculation of a fe / fe(110 ) diffusion barrier of 0.36  ev ,  @xcite and is considerably lower than the barrier of 0.65  ev for ni / ni(111 ) .",
    "the experimental results reported in the preceding sections showed that there is a structural and chemical rearrangement at the micron scale of the fe@xmath4ni@xmath5 alloy film close to @xmath40 . vacancy formation and surface diffusion are the two important ingredients in the restructuring of the film .",
    "it has been known that the surface of fe - ni alloys has a tendency to be enriched in ni .",
    "@xcite by varying the probing depth via the inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons in photon energy dependent xps ( in addition to the xas spectra acquired with the secondary photoelectrons ) we found that ( i ) there is no surface segregation in the room - temperature grown films , ( ii ) upon annealing , the surface is enriched in ni both in the fcc and bcc phases . in short ,",
    "we attribute the chemical heterogeneity predominantly to the surface diffusion of ni , with the calculated diffusion barrier of 0.34  ev as reported in the previous section .",
    "the calculated average vacancy formation energy of 1.71  ev / vacancy is in good agreement with the experimental energy barrier of @xmath58  ev found from the phase separation kinetics .",
    "moreover , the experimental kinetics indicates the presence of a barrier distribution with a fwhm of 0.17  ev .",
    "this is also reproduced in the calculated distribution of vacancy formation energies , although with a larger spread of 0.37  ev .",
    "therefore , considering the much lower surface diffusion barrier , we conclude that the rate limiting step in the phase separation in ultrathin alloy films is vacancy formation .",
    "the difference between the theoretical vacancy formation energy and the experimentally evaluated barrier lies in the temperature dependence of the vacancy formation _",
    "free _ energy .",
    "it has been recently reported that there is a pronounced change in the energy parameters associated with mono - vacancies in bcc fe as a function of temperature .",
    "@xcite in particular , the reported decrease in the vacancy formation free energy from 0  k to 600  k is about 10% which quantitatively agrees with the difference between our zero - temperature dft calculations and our experimental result at 600  k for the bcc fe - ni alloy .    as opposed to time dependence ,",
    "the length scale at which the phase separation takes place reflects the pronounced surface diffusion at around 300@xmath11c .",
    "moreover , the fcc island shapes are elongated along the @xmath43 $ ] direction , which is the faster diffusion direction on the bcc(110 ) surface .",
    "therefore , we attribute the mesoscopic morphology of the phase - separated film to surface diffusion , while the entire phase - separation and the atomic restructuring process is limited by vacancy formation .",
    "importantly , these results clarify the main distinction between an alloy film ( or the alloy surface ) and a bulk fe - ni alloy .",
    "although the surface appears crucial in determining the microscale morphology , interstitial diffusion barriers in the bcc fe and its alloys are just as low as the surface diffusion barriers .",
    "@xcite instead , the interstitial formation energy is considerably larger than that of vacancies , and our study singles out vacancy formation as the limiting step in the phase separation process . thus , the principal role of the surface in facilitating the phase separation is the creation of vacancies without forming interstitials .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally shown that the fe@xmath1ni@xmath2/w(110 ) film of thickness close to 20 atomic layers separates into micron - sized fcc and bcc regions at around 300@xmath11c .",
    "the two structural regions have distinctly different compositions and the composition difference originates from a difference in the ni amount .",
    "in addition , the energy barrier associated with the kinetics of phase separation matches the theoretically calculated vacancy formation energy .",
    "moreover , the calculated vacancy formation energy is slightly different for each vacancy configuration , giving a distribution of energy barriers in agreement with experimental observation . in the phase separation process",
    ", the surface facilitates the creation of vacancies , as well as helping ni diffusion with surface ni enrichment and the pronounced diffusion length .",
    "we expect that the observed fcc - bcc phase separation in fe - ni thin films at the mesoscopic scale will provide a model for studying the effect of chemical and structural heterogeneity on the alloy magnetic properties near the invar composition ."
