    "<S> if a client , alice , wants to communicate with another client , bob , an internet protocol determines the path that the data follows to travel across multiple networks from alice to bob . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , in the future , according to a request for performing quantum communication between alice and bob , a quantum internet protocol will supply the resources for quantum communication , such as unconditionally secure key and quantum entanglement , to alice and bob by utilizing proper intermediate nodes connected by optical fibres with each other @xcite [ c.f . fig .  [ fig:1 ]  ( a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> to such an optical network , photon loss in optical fibres is the dominant impediment in general @xcite . nonetheless , as long as alice and bob are not too far away from each other , say over a couple hundred kilometres , the intermediate nodes would not be necessary , because the current point - to - point quantum communication has already been very efficient as well as ready for practical use @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , in terms of the communication efficiency for the distance , known schemes @xcite for the point - to - point links have no scaling gap with a general upper bound on quantum communication capacity and secret key agreement capacity of any memoryless lossy channel ( which may or may not be noisy ) under the use of unlimited forward and backward classical communication , called takeoka - guha - wilde ( tgw ) bound @xcite ( see also subsequent important improvements @xcite to the tgw bound ) . hence , there remains not much room to improve those schemes for point - to - point links further . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the point - to - point communication is not efficient enough to achieve the quantum internet . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the point - to - point quantum communication over 1,000  km needs to take almost one century to provide just one bit of secure key or one ebit for them under the use of a typical standard telecom optical fibre with loss of about 0.2  db / km @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the request from far distant alice and bob , the quantum internet necessitates long - distance quantum communication schemes utilizing intermediate nodes , such as intercity qkd protocols @xcite and quantum repeaters @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , these schemes would be in greater demand for the quantum internet than the point - to - point quantum communication , analogously to the current internet where a client communicates with a far distant client via repeater nodes commonly and even unconsciously . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , besides the tgw bound for the point - to - point links , it is important to find out a similarly fundamental and general limitation on the long - distance quantum communication schemes , which results in understanding the full potential of the future quantum internet . however , it remained open to determine this limitation due to the complex nature of those schemes coming from the use of many intermediate nodes as well as a large variety of combinations of different elements such as quantum memories and quantum error correction and of different primitives such as entanglement generation , entanglement swapping and entanglement purification .    </S>",
    "<S> the main point of this paper is to present a fundamental and practical limitation on the quantum internet . in particular , we derive rate - loss tradeoffs for any two - party quantum communication  composed of the use of optical fibres connecting nodes as well as arbitrary local operations and unlimited forward and backward ( public ) classical communication ( locc)over the quantum internet , by tailoring the tgw bound to being applicable to any network topology . the key insight is reduction . given any quantum network ( which might be a subnetwork of a quantum internet ) , alice s node @xmath0 and bob s node @xmath1 , we can consider any bipartition of the nodes in the quantum network , @xmath2 including node @xmath0 and @xmath3 containing node @xmath1 [ c.f .  </S>",

    "<S> therefore , an upper bound on the key rate or distillable entanglement for a point - to - point link automatically carries over to an upper bound to the quantum network . as this upper bound for point - to - point links </S>",
    "<S> , we simply use the tgw bound @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our reduction idea is a simple observation . </S>",

    "<S> this class of qkd protocols leads to a square root improvement in the secret key rate over conventional qkd schemes ( without quantum repeaters ) bounded by the tgw bound . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it can be obtained without the need of matter quantum memories or quantum error correction @xcite , which is in a striking contrast to quantum repeaters @xcite . in particular , those protocols are modifications of the measurement - device - independent qkd ( mdiqkd ) @xcite and all of them use a single untrusted intermediate node @xmath105 in the middle of communicators alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> node @xmath105 shares optical channels with alice and bob , whose transmittance is described by @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then , using matter quantum memories at node @xmath105 @xcite or using only optical devices at node @xmath105 @xcite , the protocols present a secret bit per about @xmath107 uses of optical channels between alice and node @xmath105 and between bob and node @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the average secret bits of these protocols per channel use are in the order of @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is exactly the same scaling of the bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) , because the bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) is proportional to @xmath108 for @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath104 . </S>",

    "<S> let us compare the bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) with the performance of achievable quantum repeater protocols . </S>",
    "<S> actually , there are many quantum repeater schemes @xcite , depending on the assumed devices of the repeater nodes @xmath111 . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , a protocol assumes repeater nodes equipped with atomic - ensemble quantum memories as well as optical devices @xcite . to obtain better scaling , instead of the atomic - ensemble quantum memories , another protocols @xcite use matter qubits satisfying not only divincenzo s five criteria for a universal quantum computation but also his extra criterion on the efficient coupling with single photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , recently , there is even an all - photonic scheme @xcite that does not use matter quantum memories at all and works by using only optical devices . </S>",
    "<S> however , since our aim here is to show the existence of a quantum repeater protocol that has the same scaling with the bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) in principle , let us introduce an idealized qubit - based protocol which uses a noiseless quantum computer with the function of the perfect coupling with single photons at each repeater node </S>",
    "<S> .    in the idealized qubit - based protocol , ( i ) a node @xmath112 except for @xmath1 begins by producing a single photon which is in maximally entangled state @xmath113 with a qubit of the local quantum computer , where @xmath114 is an orthonormal basis for the polarization degrees of freedom of the single photon and @xmath115 is a computational basis of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) then , the node @xmath116 except for @xmath1 sends its right - hand - side adjacent node the single photon through the optical fibre with transmittance @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) on receiving the photon from the left - hand - side adjacent node , the node @xmath116 except for @xmath0 performs a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement to confirm the successful arrival of the single photon , and announces the measurement outcome via a heralding signal . if this qnd measurement proves the successful arrival of the single photon , the node @xmath116 transfers the quantum state of the photon into a qubit of the local quantum computer faithfully , establishing a maximally entangled state between the node @xmath116 and the left - hand - side adjacent node . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) if the node @xmath116 except for @xmath1 is informed of the loss of the sent photon in the transmission by the heralding signal from the right - hand - side adjacent node , the node @xmath116 and its right - hand - side adjacent node repeat steps ( i)-(iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) if every node shares a maximally entangled state with the adjacent nodes , all the repeater nodes @xmath117 apply the bell measurement to a pair of local qubits that have been entangled with qubits in the adjacent repeater nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this gives alice and bob a pair of qubits in a maximally entangled state .     with @xmath118 , for protocols based on a linear network with total distance @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the protocols use intermediate nodes @xmath119 connected by optical fibres each other and located at regular intervals , say @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves represent achievable performance , while the dashed curves are our general upper bounds ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) for the linear network , @xmath101 $ ] , for various @xmath121 . in panel </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) , we provide the performance of mdiqkd protocols @xcite using only a single intermediate node ( @xmath109 ) equipped with feasible optical devices . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite for the details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the key rate scales linearly with @xmath122 ( i.e. , the transmittance over distance @xmath68 ) for the mdiqkd @xcite , but it scales linearly with the square root of @xmath122 for the all - photonic intercity qkd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show our general bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) for @xmath109 as line ( i ) and the tgw bound @xcite ( corresponding to our bound with @xmath123 ) as line ( iii ) . comparing lines ( i ) and ( ii ) , we can see that the all - photonic intercity qkd protocol has the same scaling with our general bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) for @xmath109 . in panel ( b ) , for various @xmath121 , we provide the performance of the idealized qubit - based quantum repeater protocol introduced in the main text , @xmath124 , as solid lines and our bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) as dashed curves . </S>",

    "<S> since the entanglement generation process ( i)-(iii ) is repeated until a single photon sent in step ( ii ) survives over the fibre transmission with transmittance @xmath73 , the average of the number @xmath125 of the channel uses to obtain the entanglement between adjacent nodes in step ( iii ) is @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> if we regard the entanglement generation process ( i)-(iii ) as a single round of the protocol and the process is executed between adjacent repeater nodes in parallel independently , the idealized qubit - based protocol should present a pair of qubits in a maximally entangled state for the total number @xmath23 of the rounds with @xmath127 in a manner arbitrary close to a deterministic process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the average secret bits or ebits of the idealized qubit - based protocol per channel use is @xmath128 , which is exactly the same scaling of the bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is also easily confirmed by seeing fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ]  ( b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the existing quantum repeater protocols @xcite are based on more practical devices than the idealized qubit - based protocol , they must be less efficient than the idealized qubit - based protocol , owing to more imperfections caused by the practical devices . however , there are schemes @xcite whose performance is essentially determined by distance @xmath129 even under the use of such more practical devices similarly to the idealized qubit - based protocol as well as our bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) . in other words , the quantum repeater protocols @xcite have no scaling gap with our bound ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that our bound ( [ eq : mc ] ) is simple but powerful enough to derive rate - loss tradeoffs ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) with the same scaling with existing intercity qkd protocols and quantum repeaters . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have assumed that the intermediate nodes @xmath117 are located at regular intervals , but this assumption is unnecessary . in particular , similarly to the derivation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : qr-3 ] ) , from our bound ( [ eq : mc ] ) , it is not difficult to obtain rate - loss tradeoffs for any linear optical network where the intermediate nodes are not necessarily positioned at regular intervals , and the existing intercity qkd protocols and quantum repeater protocols are still shown to have the same scaling with the tradeoffs . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the future quantum internet protocol was programmed to always find out a linear network as the subnetwork @xmath24 over the quantum internet by using an algorithm for the shortest path problem , our bound for the linear network would help to run the algorithm via determining the weights for all the edges associated with optical channels . </S>",
    "<S> this application will also hold even if the quantum internet protocol uses tree networks as the subnetwork @xmath24 instead of linear networks . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the quantum internet protocol prefers to use a more general network topology as the subnetwork @xmath24 . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> , our bound is useful to determine the obtainable secret bits or ebits because they are always upper bounded by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mc ] ) for the minimum bipartition given by choosing @xmath2 and @xmath3 properly .    </S>",
    "<S> although we have just considered only the lossy channels as the examples of the applications of our bound ( [ eq : mc ] ) , this is , of course , not only the case as long as the squashed entanglement of the channel in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mc ] ) can be estimated for given channels . </S>",
    "<S> even though in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , we have plotted only the results for a linear chain of pure - loss channels , it should be noted that the tgw bound is very general and applies to any memoryless lossy channels ( which may or may not be noisy ) and , with the observation made in the present paper , to any network topology . while we have employed mainly the tgw bound in our paper , it should be noted that our reduction idea may be useful to derive a good bound for a general network topology from a bound for point - to - point quantum communication generally . </S>",
    "<S> we have just begun to grasp full implications of our bound : for instance , its applications to the many - body physics regarded as a quantum network and to a more complicated quantum communication protocol  such as a multi - party protocol like ref .  </S>",
