    ", we quantify the improvements in luminosity and signal efficiency necessary for the tevatron to place exclusion limits on the higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "we begin in section 2 by reviewing briefly the mssm higgs spectrum and the coupling strengths relative to the standard model .",
    "then , in section 3 we discuss the translation of standard model exclusion limits into limits on the mssm . we examine four benchmark scenarios in the mssm parameter space and analyze the limit - setting potential of the tevatron according to a range of increases in luminosity and efficiencies projected by the experimental collaborations .",

    "the plots produced by cdf and d@xmath4 ( @xcite,@xcite ) provide upper limits at 95% c.l . on the parameter @xmath49 , which is the higgs signal in the decay channel @xmath50 , normalized to the signal in that channel predicted by the standard model : @xmath51 nave estimates for the limits",

    "[ figcombcdfd0 ] , we combine the results from cdf and d@xmath4 , again comparing with the overall combined curve given by the collaborations  @xcite .",
    "note that with these curves , the mass range @xmath62 gev is not excluded .",
    "this is because we are combining the _ expected _ limits from each channel , rather than the experimentally observed limits .",
    "a downward fluctuation was observed in the analysis of the @xmath7 channel , leading to the exclusion .",
    "the reason we take the expected limits is so that we can rescale them by projected increases in luminosity and signal efficiency .",
    "the overall sm higgs limits corresponding to three such improvement scenarios are also presented in fig .",
    "[ figcombcdfd0 ] .",
    "the first assumes an increase in luminosity up to 10  fb@xmath63 per experiment in all channels .",
    "such an increase in luminosity is expected , if the tevatron continues running until mid-2011 .",
    "the second assumes the same luminosity increase , as well as 25% efficiency improvements in the detection of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 higgs decay channels .",
    "the final scenario increases the efficiency improvements further to 50% .",
    "it is important to note that each of these efficiency improvements scale down the previous upper bound by about 20% .",
    "this is approximately the same reduction achieved by increasing the luminosity from 7  fb@xmath63 to 10  fb@xmath63 , or by decreasing the statistical significance from 95% to 90% .",
    "therefore , our results can be reinterpreted in this context : if the luminosity only reaches 7  fb@xmath63 , an efficiency improvement of 50% in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 channels will be necessary to reach the exclusion limit achieved with 10  fb@xmath63 and a 25% increase in efficiency .",
    "if only 25% is gained in efficiency and 7  fb@xmath63 in luminosity , the same exclusions will apply at 90% c.l .",
    "we emphasize that our nave combination leads to a conservative upper limit on the @xmath48 parameter , up to about 10% larger than that presented by the experimental collaborations in some ranges of higgs mass .",
    "furthermore , it does not include the possible effects of new search channels .",
    "for example , one channel not included in our analysis is the @xmath66 from d@xmath4 , which , from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , would improve the nave combined bound on @xmath48 by up to 1.5% in the @xmath67 gev mass range .",
    "therefore , our improvement factors imply upper bounds on those required for large coverage of the sm higgs mass range .    it is clear from figs .",
    "[ figcombcdf]-  [ figcombcdfd0 ] that higgs masses near @xmath68 gev will be the most difficult to probe .",
    "it is essential in this region to include constraints from both @xmath64 and @xmath65 decay channels . as a test of the strength of the @xmath65 limit in the low mass region , in fig .",
    "[ fignobb ] we plot the limit in the sm and in a modification of the sm where the higgs coupling to down - type fermions is highly suppressed , leading to an enhancement of the branching ratio to @xmath65 .",
    "this scenario arises in a certain window of mssm parameters .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fignobb ] that the bound is quite strong ( @xmath69 for @xmath70gev@xmath71gev ) even without any improvements in efficiency or luminosity .",
    "the combined constraint can not be used immediately to place limits on the mssm , because as mentioned previously it is a constraint on models that differ from the sm by a single constant rescaling of @xmath72 for all channels . in the mssm",
    ", different channels will be related to the sm channels by different rescalings .",
    "therefore , each channel should be individually scaled so that the @xmath73 constraint bounds the higgs signal normalized to the expected signal from the mssm :    @xmath74    then , the @xmath75 can be combined as in eq .  ( [ 2 ] ) above to give a net constraint on the mssm .",
    "we include both the light and the heavy @xmath10-even mssm higgs bosons as intermediate states for each channel .",
    "the most sensitive tevatron searches for sm - like higgs bosons have been in the @xmath64 channel with associated production of the higgs , and the @xmath65 channel with higgs production via gluon fusion .",
    "these channels require sizeable higgs gauge couplings , and therefore have been primarily relevant for the light higgs @xmath11 , which has sm - like gauge couplings in most of parameter space .",
    "however , as @xmath15 decreases the mixing angle becomes larger and @xmath76 becomes smaller , so @xmath12 becomes increasingly sm - like and consequently plays a bigger role in the constraints inferred from these searches .",
    "in contrast to @xmath64 , the @xmath5 channel search is inclusive  @xcite , and therefore conservative limits can be inferred for both sm - like and nonstandard higgs searches . as an upper limit on the associated production channel",
    ", it can be interpreted as a constraint from an sm - like search .",
    "this constraint is typically quite weak compared to the limit from the @xmath64 channels , as can be seen from fig .",

    "( [ 3 ] ) is @xmath42 . in the following",
    "we will always lump this sm - like @xmath5 constraint together with the @xmath64 constraint . on the other hand , when the @xmath5 data is taken as a limit on the gluon fusion production channel , the constraint from the cp - odd and nonstandard cp - even higgs bosons can be quite strong  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these particles have @xmath77 enhanced production rates through loops of bottom quarks , and so the rescaling factor relative to the sm can be significant if they are sufficiently light . in the following ,",
    "when we refer to the @xmath5 constraint , we mean this constraint coming from the nonstandard higgs search .",
    "our strategy will be as follows : we pick benchmark scenarios for all the mssm parameters except for @xmath16 and @xmath15 , which are the dominant parameters affecting the higgs signal .",
    "we scan over the @xmath0 plane , calculating the spectrum and the scaling factors @xmath78 for all channels .",
    "the masses and branching ratios are computed numerically using hdecay @xcite , and in particular the numerator is calculated at the standard model higgs mass equal to the mass of the @xmath10-even mssm higgs in the intermediate state ( we checked that similar results are obtained by using cpsuperh  @xcite ) .",
    "finally we read off the expected @xmath79 from the cdf and d@xmath4 plots and use eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) to compute the value of @xmath73 at each point in the parameter space .",

    "this will demonstrate the capabilities of the separate searches in covering the mssm parameter space . at the end",
    "we will combine the constraints to see the complementarity of the coverage .",
    "we consider four benchmark sets of soft parameters @xcite , which enter in the dominant loop corrections to the higgs mass matrix .",
    "all soft sfermion masses are set to a common value @xmath81 and the top quark mass is set to the current central value of @xmath82 gev  @xcite .",
    "we scan over @xmath15 from @xmath83 gev to @xmath84 gev in 100 steps , and @xmath16 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 also in 100 steps .",
    "the first benchmark point is the case of maximal mixing , with @xmath87 as mentioned previously , this choice of parameters leads to the largest radiative addition to the lightest higgs mass .",
    "the second point is the opposite scenario of minimal stop mixing , @xmath88 here the mass of the lightest higgs is lower , @xmath89 gev , and the constraint will be stronger , as can be seen from the standard model combined curve . the soft supersymmetry - breaking mass scale is increased in this scenario in order to avoid lep bounds  @xcite .",
    "we chose a value of @xmath31 of order @xmath90 . a larger value of @xmath31 , of the order of the stop masses , would lead to a decrease in the lightest cp - even higgs mass of about 2  gev in most of the parameter space , without affecting the quality of higgs searches in the analyzed channels .",
    "the third benchmark lies in the  gluophobic \" region , where the gluon fusion mechanism for production of the sm - like higgs is suppressed by a cancellation between the top quark loop and the stop loop  @xcite .",
