    "strongly correlated materials exhibit a wealth of fascinating physical phenomena associated with complex single - electron and many - electron interactions .",
    "transition metal oxides , for example , tend to have partially filled shells of highly correlated @xmath0 electrons , surrounded by complicated lattice geometries , with many atoms and electrons per unit cell .",
    "the theoretical description of the electronic properties of these materials is a challenging topic in condensed matter physics .",
    "significant advances were achieved during recent years via the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite which provides a treatment of single - electron and many - electron interactions on the same footing .    for realistic materials , dmft has been used extensively in combination with the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it can be readily applied to systems consisting of two or more subbands .",
    "it has the drawback , however , that , to avoid sign problems at low temperatures , it includes only ising - like exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "improvements of the qmc method to include the full hund s coupling are so far limited to @xmath1 or rather high temperatures @xcite . in view of this limitation",
    "there is clearly a need to explore alternative methods that are applicable to multi - band materials and complete onsite exchange interactions .",
    "the aim of the present work is two - fold : first , exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite is proposed as a potentially highly useful impurity solver for finite-@xmath2 dmft studies of realistic systems .",
    "the attractive feature of this approach is that , in contrast to finite-@xmath2 qmc , onsite coulomb and exchange interactions are treated on the same basis .",
    "second , we apply finite-@xmath2 ed / dmft to a highly nontrivial system which has recently received considerable attention , namely , the two - band hubbard model consisting of subbands of different widths @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of this system was recently evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we focus on the electronic properties of the so - called orbital - selective phase in which the narrow band is insulating while the wide band is still metallic . to examine the influence of finite - size effects in the ed approach , and to investigate the electronic properties in the limit of low temperatures , we have also performed numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) dmft calculations for a simplified two - band model which is particularly suited for the intermediate phase .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the two - band ed / dmft calculations provide a correct picture of the electronic properties of the hubbard model involving nonequivalent subbands , including the unusual non - fermi - liquid properties of the orbital - selective phase .",
    "this outcome is remarkable since , for computational reasons , the number of bath levels per impurity orbital is necessarily smaller than in analogous one - band models . nevertheless , despite this limitation , the ed results are in good qualitative or , in some cases , quantitative agreement with the nrg results . in the ising case",
    "they also agree very well with previous qmc / dmft results @xcite .",
    "the overall consistency with the nrg and qmc calculations suggests that finite-@xmath2 ed / dmft might indeed be very useful in the future to analyze realistic materials , especially , if full diagonalization is replaced by finite-@xmath2 lanczos methods @xcite in order to be able to deal with larger cluster sizes .",
    "hubbard models involving nonequivalent subbands are relevant for compounds such as ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 and na@xmath4coo@xmath6 , where , as a result of the nearly two - dimensional lattice structure , coexisting narrow and wide bands arise naturally .",
    "thus , onsite coulomb energies can be simultaneously large and small relative to the widths of important subbands . as a function of doping concentration , both materials give rise to a remarkably rich sequence of phases , including superconductivity and mott insulating behavior @xcite .",
    "evidently , the competition between multiple kinetic energy scales and local coulomb and exchange energies is an important feature of these strongly correlated systems .",
    "a consistent treatment of coulomb and exchange interactions in materials of this kind is important since it has recently become clear that the hund s coupling has a decisive influence on the nature of the mott transition @xcite .",
    "in fact , the different treatments of exchange terms in earlier finite-@xmath2 qmc @xcite and zero-@xmath2 ed @xcite calculations have given rise to some confusion , with apparently contradictory results . as was clarified in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 and in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath7 , however , the qmc and ed results are in agreement provided that exchange interactions are treated in the same manner .",
    "thus , for full hund s coupling the two - band hubbard model exhibits successive first - order transitions . in striking contrast , in the absence of spin - flip and pair - exchange only the lower transition remains first - order @xcite .",
    "moreover , as will be discussed in detail below , the nature of the intermediate phase depends in a subtle manner on the treatment of exchange interactions . in this regard",
    "the ed and nrg results yield the following picture : for full hund s coupling , the wide band has infinite lifetime at @xmath8 but does not satisfy fermi - liquid criteria at finite frequencies .",
    "this finding is consistent with recent results obtained by biermann _",
    "@xcite in @xmath1 two - band ed / dmft calculations . for ising exchange , instead",
    ", correlations are significantly enhanced and the lifetime becomes finite even at @xmath8 , in agreement with qmc calculations @xcite .",
    "_ thus , the mott transition in the hubbard model involving different subbands does not consist of equivalent sequential transitions .",
    "instead , when the narrow band becomes insulating , the wide band is forced into a bad - metallic state whose deviations from fermi - liquid behavior depend in a qualitative manner on the treatment of exchange interactions . _    in the past , finite-@xmath2 ed / dmft methods have been applied mainly to single - band cases , where the incorporation of an appropriate cluster of bath levels is feasible . throughout this paper",
    "we consider two impurity levels , each surrounded by either 2 or 3 bath levels , giving total cluster sizes @xmath9 or @xmath10 per spin .",
    "below we demonstrate that even a cluster size of @xmath9 provides qualitatively correct subband self - energies .",
    "for instance , at @xmath11  mev the critical coulomb energies of the orbital - selective mott transitions for @xmath9 differ by only about 0.1  0.2  ev from those derived for @xmath10 .",
    "this finding is interesting since it suggests that finite-@xmath2 ed / dmft calculations for more realistic three - band models using a cluster size of @xmath12 ( three impurity levels , each coupled to two bath levels ) should be useful .",
    "this would allow one to re - examine the mott transition in systems that have been studied previously using qmc / dmft for ising exchange interactions .",
    "a more accurate representation of low - frequency properties at low temperatures requires three bath levels per impurity orbital : one near the fermi level to provide adequate metallicity , and two for the upper and lower hubbard bands , giving @xmath10 per spin .",
    "this extension leads to a significant reduction of finite - size effects .",
    "several comparisons of results for @xmath9 and @xmath10 are provided below to illustrate the range of applicability of the two - band ed / dmft approach .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 the multiband hubbard model is specified and its numerical solution via the finite-@xmath2 exact diagonalization method is discussed .",
    "section 3 describes the effective one - band model used in the nrg approach to evaluate the electronic properties of the wide band in the intermediate phase when the narrow band is insulating . in section 4 the ed / dmft",
    "is applied to the purely metallic phase just below the first mott transition .",
    "section 5 deals with the intermediate phase in the presence of full hund s coupling , where wide band exhibits infinite lifetime at @xmath8 , combined with non - fermi - liquid behavior at finite frequencies . in section 6",
    "this intermediate phase is considered in the absence of spin - flip and pair - exchange terms , giving rise to finite lifetime even at @xmath8 . in section 7",
    "the two - band ed approach is applied to the case studied previously within qmc / dmft @xcite .",
