    "the accretion flow geometry in stellar - mass black holes may change considerably with the mass accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "characteristic periods of correlated intensity , energy spectral hardness , and fast variability in the x - ray band are identified as `` states '' ( for a review , see tanaka & lewin 1995 ; see also homan et al .",
    "these states are observed in all stellar - mass black holes , and are thought to be driven primarily by changes in @xmath3 .",
    "of five common states , the `` very high '' state is perhaps the least - understood .",
    "often the first state observed in a transient outburst and usually very luminous , a variety of phenomena are observed that indicate a unique inner accretion flow environment .",
    "fast quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ; 30450  hz )  if tied to the keplerian frequency of the inner accretion disk  indicate accretion disks which extend close to the marginally stable circular orbit for a schwarzschild black hole , and may even indicate black hole spin ( e. g. , strohmayer 2001 , miller et al .",
    "discrete jet ejections are sometimes observed in the radio band with velocities that approach @xmath4 ( for a review , see fender 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray energy spectra observed in the very high state are a mix of thermal and non - thermal components .",
    "the spectra suggest a disk which may extend close to the black hole , and a corona ( the assumed non - thermal source ) which irradiates the disk and produces a `` reflection '' spectrum ( george & fabian 1991 ; see also gierlinski et al .",
    "1999 ) .    with adequate spectral resolution ,",
    "fe  k@xmath1 line profiles may provide effective tools for constraining the nature of accretion flows ( e.  g.  miller et al .",
    "2002 ) in stellar - mass black holes .",
    "such profiles have been used to infer black hole spin and rotational energy extraction via magnetic fields in active galactic nuclei ( agns ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 , wilms et al .",
    "evidence for spin , based on fe  k@xmath1 line profiles , has also been reported in stellar - mass black holes , but with gas proportional counters offering lower resolution and inhibiting stronger conclusions ( balucinska - church & church 2000 , miller et al .",
    "2001b , campana et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the high effective area of _ xmm - newton _ and short frame times available with the epic - pn camera are well - suited to capturing high resolution spectra of bright sources .",
    "we were granted a target - of - opportunity observation to study the galactic black hole candidate xte  j1650@xmath0500 ( remillard 2001 ) early in its fall , 2001 outburst . although a neutron star primary can only be ruled - out by optical radial velocity measurements , there is strong evidence in x - rays that xte  j1650@xmath0500 harbors a black hole .",
    "based on the spectrum we obtained with _ xmm - newton _ and timing properties ( wijnands , miller , & lewin 2001 ) , we observed xte  j1650@xmath0500 in the very high state  the first pile - up - free ccd spectrum of a stellar - mass black hole in this state . herein , we report the detection of a broad fe  k@xmath1 line .",
    "we discuss the implications of this line for the accretion flow geometry in this source , and explore connections to the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the seyfert - i agn mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "we observed xte  j1650@xmath0500 with _ xmm - newton _ on 13 september , 2001 , from 15:45:2521:41:04 ( ut ) for a total exposure of 21.4  ks .",
    "we did not operate the epic - mos2 camera or the optical monitor to preserve telemetry .",
    "the epic - mos1 camera was operated in timing mode but suffered a full scientific buffer nearly continuously due to the high flux .",
    "full spectral results from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs , 0.332.5  kev ) will be reported in a separate paper . to prevent photon pile - up ,",
    "the epic - pn camera was operated in `` burst '' mode with the `` thin '' optical filter in place ( for more information on the pn camera , see stder et al .",
    "only one ccd of the pn camera is active in burst mode , and spatial information is only recorded in one dimension .",
    "burst mode has a time resolution of 7  @xmath5s , but a duty cycle of approximately 3% .",
    "we extracted source counts using a box region centered on the source position ( with x an y half - widths of 1694 and 28 , respectively , in det units ) .",
    "two background regions adjacent to the source position were selected .",
    "single and double events were included for analysis .",
    "standard pn filtering was accomplished with the procedure xmmea_ep , assuming a source position of @xmath6 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "2001 ; groot et al .",
    "we measured a source count rate of @xmath7  counts  s@xmath8 , and a background count rate of @xmath9  counts  s@xmath8 . calibrated event lists were custom - made at mpe using sas5.3@xmath1 .",
    "the source and background spectra were created with sas5.2.0 .",
    "spectra were grouped based both on a requirement for counts per channel ( 20 ) and on the maximum number of spectral channels sampling the pn energy resolution ( 3 ) .",
    "this is the first spectral analysis to be reported from an observation which employed burst mode . despite the peculiarities of this mode , the instrumental effective area and the energy response , and charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) correction",
    "do not differ from more standard modes ( kirsch et al .",
    "therefore , `` full frame '' mode response matrices were created to model the instrument response using sas5.2.0 .",
    "the spectral fits reported herein were made using xspec version 11.1.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "quoted errors correspond to @xmath10 .",
    "below 0.5  kev and above 10.0  kev , deviations were seen in the residuals regardless of the spectral model used .",
    "we therefore restricted our analysis to the 0.510.0  kev band .",
    "we note a feature at 2.34  kev which appears as an emission line .",
    "the detector effective area changes sharply at this energy and the line is well - fit by a zero - width gaussian , suggesting that the feature is instrumental .",
    "in examining the epic - pn and rgs data of xte  j1650@xmath0500 , we find oxygen to be @xmath11% under - abundant , neon to be @xmath12% over - abundant , and iron to be @xmath13% under - abundant relative to solar values along this line of sight ( assuming abundances as measured by anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the rgs spectrum reveals that the oxygen edge location is more consistent with 0.536  kev than the expected 0.532  kev ; this has also been noted in fits to chandra data of cygnus  x-1 ( schulz et al .",
    "2001 , miller et al .",
    "we therefore fixed the oxygen edge to be at 0.536  kev in all fits .",
    "all other elements are found to have abundances consistent with solar values .",
    "absorption in the ism was modeled using the `` vphabs '' model in xspec ( with the abundance of oxygen set to zero ,       and an additional edge to model the oxygen absorption at 0.536  kev ) .",

    ".    fits with the standard multicolor accretion disk black body ( hereafter , mcd ; mitusda et al .",
    "1984 ) plus power - law model to the 0.510.0  kev spectrum were statistically unacceptable ( @xmath16 for 233 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the data / model ratio for this model is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the emission line profile in this data / model ratio is similar to that observed in cygnus x-1 with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( miller et al .",
    "2002 ) , and similar to line profiles seen in some agns with _ asca _",
    "( see , e. g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ; weaver , gelbord , & yaqoob 2001 ) .",
    "gaussian emission line and smeared edge ( see ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) components were added to the model .",
    "the addition of these components improved the fit significantly ( @xmath17 for 225 d.o.f . ) . using this model , we measure an inner disk color temperature of @xmath18  kev , and an mcd normalization of @xmath19 .",
    "the measured power - law index is @xmath20 ; the normalization of this component is measured to be @xmath21 ph  @xmath15  s@xmath8  kev@xmath8 at 1  kev .",
    "the 0.510.0  kev flux of the mcd component is @xmath22  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath8 , and that for the power - law component is @xmath23  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath8 .",
    "the best - fit gaussian indicates a broad line , shifted from the neutral fe  k@xmath1 line energy of 6.40  kev : e@xmath24  kev , fwhm@xmath25  kev , and w@xmath26  ev . the edge is measured to be at e@xmath27  kev , with a depth of @xmath28 .",
    "however , significant residuals remain in the fe  k@xmath1 line region with this fit , due in part to the non - gaussian nature of the line profile ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , on a broader energy range ( one that includes the 2030  kev `` compton hump '' seen in many sources ) , a reflection model is often required to fit the spectra of stellar - mass black holes ( see , e.g. , gierlinski et al .",
    "broad gaussian and smeared edge components are merely an approximation to a full reflection model in the 0.510.0  kev band . therefore , we now focus on the results of fitting more sophisticated , physically - motivated reflection models .",
    "these replace the hard power - law , gaussian , and smeared edge components discussed above .    anticipating a highly - ionized accretion disk",
    ", we made fits with the `` constant density ionized disk '' reflection model ( hereafter , cdid ; ross , fabian , & young 1999 ) .",
    "this model measures the relative strengths of the directly - observed and reflected flux , the accretion disk ionization parameter ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the x - ray luminosity , @xmath31 is the hydrogen number density , and @xmath32 is radius ) , and the photon index of the illuminating power - law flux .",
    "fe  k@xmath1 line emission and line broadening due to comptonization in an ionized disk surface layer are included in this model .",
    "the fit obtained with this model is shown in the top panel of figure  2 .",
    "the photon index of the irradiating power law is measured to be @xmath33 .",
    "the ionization parameter is high : @xmath34  erg  cm  s@xmath8 , and the relative strength of reflected flux is measured to be @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 ) . while the shape of the fe  k edge is reproduced by this model , the width and shape of the fe  k@xmath1 line is not , and a statistically - poor fit is obtained ( @xmath37 for 231 d.o.f . ) .",
    "the ionization parameter obtained with this model corresponds to a mixture of helium - like and hydrogenic ion species of fe ( kallman and mccray 1982 ) .",
    "as doppler shifts and general relativistic smearing may be expected for lines produced in an accretion disk close to the black hole , we next made fits after convolving ( or , `` blurring '' ) the cdid model with the line element expected near a kerr black hole .",
    "we assumed an inner disk radius of 1.24  @xmath38 , an outer line production radius of 400  @xmath38 , and an inclination of @xmath39 ( in fits with this and other models , intermediate inclinations were marginally preferred in terms of @xmath40 ) . with this blurred model",
    ", we obtained parameter constraints which differed marginally from the previous fit : @xmath41  erg  cm  s@xmath8 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the shape and strength of the fe  k@xmath1 line are not fit adequately ; the fit is slightly worse than the un - blurred model ( @xmath44 , 231 d.o.f . ) .    finally , we constructed a model which allows the fe  k@xmath1 line and reflection components to be treated separately .",
    "we fit the line with the `` laor '' line model ( laor 1991 ) , and the power - law and reflection continuum ( minus the line ) with the `` pexriv '' model ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) . with pexriv , @xmath45 corresponds to a disk which intercepts half of the incident power - law flux .",
    "it should be noted that this model was also used by wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in fits to the _ xmm - newton_/epic spectrum of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 , allowing for a direct comparison . for the laor line",
    ", we initially fixed the inner disk edge at 1.24  @xmath38 , the outer line production region at 400  @xmath38 , and the inclination at @xmath39 .",
    "the line energy , emissivity profile ( @xmath46 ; we fit for @xmath47 ) , and intensity were allowed to vary .",
    "the mcd and pexriv reflection components were blurred as before .",
    "we found that the data could not simultaneously constrain @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the disk surface temperature with pexriv ( an additional          parameter for this model ) .",
    "we therefore fixed the ionization parameter at @xmath50  erg  cm  s@xmath8 , and the disk surface temperature at @xmath51kev  ( as per ross , fabian , & young 1999 in fits to cygnus x-1 , wherein a similarly low mcd disk temperature but similarly high values of @xmath49 are reported ) .",
    "the fit obtained with this model is shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 . statistically , this model represents a significant improvement ( @xmath52 for 229 d.o.f . ) .",
    "a power - law index of @xmath53 is obtained .",
    "we measure the fe  k@xmath1 line to be centered at e@xmath54  kev , likely due to a blend of fe  xxv and fe  xxvi ( helium - like and hydrogenic fe ) and consistent with the high ionization parameters previously measured .",
    "the line is strong , with an equivalent width of w@xmath55  ev and a flux of @xmath56  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath8  ( @xmath57  ph  @xmath15  s@xmath8 ) . when the inner disk edge is allowed to vary , an inner radius of 1.24  @xmath38  ( the limit of the laor model , corresponding to @xmath58 ) is preferred over an inner radius of 6.0  @xmath38  ( the marginally stable circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole ) at the 6@xmath59 level of confidence .",
    "a steep emissivity is suggested via the laor line model : @xmath60 .",
    "this emissivity is preferred over that for a standard accretion disk ( @xmath61 ) at the 5.6@xmath59 level of confidence .",
    "the pexriv reflection `` fraction '' is @xmath62 .",
    "this is consistent with the reflection fractions measured in the high state of cygnus  x-1 ( gierlinski et al .",
    "1999 ) , wherein the disk may extend to the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "it is not likely that these results can be explained in terms of an anomalous fe abundance . allowing @xmath47 and @xmath63 ( in pexriv ) to vary ,",
    "the abundance is poorly constrained : @xmath64 , and the emissivity drops only slightly to @xmath65 . fixing the emissivity at @xmath61 and allowing the fe abundance to vary yields a significantly worse fit ( @xmath66 for 229 d.o.f . ) and fe must be more than 30 times over - abundant .",
    "we note that the line strength and reflection fraction in our final fit are not strictly congruent , and that @xmath67 is below the reflection fraction measured in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath68 , wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) using a similar model .",
    "if we fix the @xmath69 in our final model , @xmath40 increases only slightly ( @xmath70 for 230 d.o.f . ) , and the other fit parameters only change within their 1@xmath59 confidence intervals .",
    "thus , more congruent values of @xmath48 are allowed by the data .",
    "the high @xmath40 value associated with our final model could be due to unmodeled narrow spectral features , approximations in the model , and calibration issues .",
    "we note a feature at approximately 7.0  kev , which may be a narrow edge due to neutral fe or an fe  xxvi absorption line .",
    "alternatively , there may be an fe  k@xmath47 emission line near 7.4  kev due to ionized fe species , which is superimposed upon the broader smeared edge fit by the reflection models .",
    "there is also weak evidence for a narrow absorption edge feature near 9.3  kev , consistent with fe  xxvi .",
    "modeling these features and the addition of 0.5% systematic errors below 1  kev are sufficient to make the fit acceptable .",
    "we have observed a broad fe  k@xmath1 line profile in the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn spectrum of the galactic black hole candidate xte  j1650@xmath0500 in the very high state . a comparison with the broad line profile observed with _",
    "chandra _ in cygnus x-1 is shown in figure  1 . that such profiles are observed in very different systems ,",
    "strongly suggests that broad fe  k@xmath1 lines in stellar - mass black holes stem from a common process . like the broad lines observed in some seyfert agns , these lines are likely produced by irradiation of the inner disk .",
    "the fe  k@xmath1 line we have observed in xte  j1650@xmath0500 suggests a kerr black hole with near - maximal angular momentum ( @xmath58 ) . the accretion disk emissivity profile measured with the laor line model is inconsistent with the energy dissipation expected for standard disks .",
    "these results are very similar to those reported by wilms et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using the same line and reflection models for the broad fe  k@xmath1 line observed in an _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn spectrum of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( e@xmath71  kev , w@xmath72400  ev , @xmath73 , @xmath745.0 ) .",
    "those authors suggest that rotational energy extraction from the spinning black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) or material in the plunging region ( agol & krolik 2000 ) may infuse the inner accretion disk with extra energy via magnetic connections , creating the steep emissivity profile indicated by the fe  k@xmath1 line .",
    "it is possible that rotational energy extraction may be at work in xte  j1650@xmath0500 as well .",
    "if so , a fundamental general relativistic prediction may be confirmed across a factor of roughly @xmath2 in black hole mass .",
    "this observation suggests a connection between the accretion geometry of stellar - mass black holes in the very high state , and that inferred in some seyfert galaxies .",
    "this is an important step towards understanding the nature of the very high state , and the variety of exotic phenomena observed in this state .",
    "the blandford ",
    "znajek process is also often invoked as a means of launching jets ( blandford 2001a , 2001b ; see also fender 2001 ) .",
    "that we have found an emissivity which might be explained by magnetic connections to the black hole or to matter in the plunging region in the very high state of xte  j1650@xmath0500 ( detected at 7.5  mjy at 0.8  ghz with most in this state with a spectrum indicative of jets ; s. tingay , priv . comm . ) , suggests that the discrete radio ejections observed in some sources in this state ( see fender 2001 ) may be driven by rotational energy extraction .",
    "martocchia , matt , & karas ( 2002 ) have shown that a `` lamp - post '' reflection model may explain the steep disk emissivity implied in fits to the fe  k@xmath1 line in mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "this model assumes a source of power - law flux which illuminates the accretion disk from a location directly above the black hole . to explain @xmath75",
    ", this model requires @xmath76  well above the values we measure .",
    "therefore , the lamp - post model may not adequately describe the accretion geometry of xte  j1650@xmath0500 .",
