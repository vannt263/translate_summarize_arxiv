    "another interesting feature is that the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition is always accompanied by a structural transition either before the afm transition or at the same temperature ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the 122-type aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( ae = ba , sr , ca , eu ) parent compounds and the 11-type fe@xmath3te systems , the structural and afm transitions occur simultaneously . for the rare - earth based 1111-type refeaso ( re = la , ce , pr , nd , etc . )",
    "materials and the 111-type afeas ( a = li , na ) compounds , the structural transition precedes the afm transition by about 10@xmath020k .",
    "till now , the relationship between the structural and magnetic phase transition has been an open question though it has been suggested that the structural transition may be driven magnetically @xcite .",
    "but there is angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) evidence @xcite that structural and afm transitions may share the same origin and could both be driven by the electronic structure reconstruction in nafeas . actually , the nature of the afm order itself is still under debate , with some favoring a localized picture and others supporting an itinerant nature .    to understand the interplay between structural , magnetic , and electronic properties , a microscopic investigation by mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite may be very helpful . in the present work ,",
    "we report detailed mssbauer spectroscopy measurements and first - principles calculations of srfeasf . the srfeasf parent compound , which has the largest reported temperature interval ( @xmath050k ) between the two phase transitions @xcite , offers an ideal opportunity to address what happens between the structural and afm transitions .",
    "our results show strong evidence of charge redistribution at the afm phase transition in the srfeasf compound .",
    "srfeasf was synthesized using a two - step solid - state reaction method , which is similar to that described earlier @xcite .",
    "first , sras / feas was prepared by reacting sr / fe flakes / powders and as powders sealed in an evacuated quartz tube at 773k for 10h and then at 1000k for 20h .",
    "the resultant precursors , sras , feas , srf@xmath2 and fe powders , were mixed and thoroughly ground at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:1 .",
    "all the weighing and mixing procedures were performed in a glove box with protective argon atmosphere . then the mixture was pressed into a pellet , sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and heated up to 1273k at a rate of 60k / h , kept at this temperature for 40h , and cooled down to room temperature .",
    "the product was homogenized in an agate mortar , pressed into a pellet , and sintered at 1273k for 40h again to obtain the final sample .",
    "phase purity was checked by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) on a philips xpert diffractometer with cu k@xmath4 radiation .",
    "rietveld refinement of the srfeasf was performed with the gsas package @xcite to obtain the lattice parameters .",

    "the wave functions are described by atomic like functions inside the atomic spheres , while in the interstitial region plane waves are used .",
    "the maximum angular momenta @xmath9 for the expansion of the wave functions in the spherical harmonics inside the spheres is confined to @xmath10 .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath11 for limiting the number of the plane waves is set as 7.0 .",
    "the magnitude of the largest vector in the fourier expansion of the electron density ( @xmath12 ) is set to 14.0 .",
    "states lying more than 6ry below the fermi level are treated as the core states .",
    "the brillouin zone integration is done with a modified tetrahedron method using 648 special @xmath13-points in the irreducible wedge .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) suggested by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe gga ) @xcite is employed for the exchange - correlation effects .",
    "once the electron ( spin- ) densities are calculated self - consistently with high accuracy , hyperfine parameters can be deduced directly @xcite .",
    "the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor can be obtained from an integral over the nonspherical electron density .",
    "the most interesting principal component @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the second - order legendre polynomial and @xmath17 is the electron density . in the lapw method , @xmath17 is expressed by lattice harmonics , i.e. under an @xmath18 form , @xmath19 .",
    "it turns out , only the component @xmath20 is important to @xmath14 . and when @xmath21 and @xmath22 , only @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( and to a minor extent @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) give non - zero gaunt numbers , which correspond to @xmath29-@xmath29 and @xmath30-@xmath30 contributions to the efg , respectively .",

    "[ moss ] . clearly , the spectra change from the paramagnetic ( pm ) state ( singlet or unresolved doublet ) to the magnetically split state ( sextet ) upon lowering of the temperature .",
    "the hamiltonian for the hyperfine coupling in the principal axis system of the efg can be expressed as @xcite @xmath32 \\\\ \\nonumber & & - g\\mu_nb[(\\hat{i}_x\\cos\\phi + \\hat{i}_y\\sin\\phi)\\sin\\theta + \\hat{i}_z\\cos\\theta],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 refer to the nuclear spin operator and operators of the nuclear spin projections onto the principal axes and @xmath35 denotes the quadrupole moment of the nucleus ( for excited @xmath6fe @xmath36b @xcite ) . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the azimuthal and polar angles of the hyperfine magnetic field in the efg coordinate system , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 represents the asymmetry parameter of the efg at the nucleus . in the present case ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the efg has axial symmetry around the @xmath40-axis @xcite .",
    "therefore , above the afm transition temperature , one has a doublet with quadrupole splitting @xmath41 .",
    "below the afm transition temperature , due to the smallness of the quadrupole interaction in comparison with the magnetic dipole interaction , the assumption of first - order perturbation can be made .",
    "hence , eigenvalues of the magnetic hamiltonian are perturbed ( shifted ) by the term @xmath42 @xcite . considering the established magnetic structure , @xmath43 , the sign of @xmath14 and the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant ( nqcc ) , @xmath44 , can be obtained subsequently .",
    "as can be seen , the spectra can be well fitted by only one doublet/(sextet ) above/(below ) the transition region , indicating that the local environment of the fe ion is unique .",
    "this means that there is no fe containing impurity phase in our sample , coincident with the xrpd results . at room temperature",
    "the best fit of the spectra gives an isomer shift of @xmath450.44mm / s and a quadrupole splitting of @xmath460.12mm / s , which compares well with reported values for srfeasf @xcite and other 1111-type iron - pnictides @xcite . at temperatures in the transition region ( 100k-125k ) the ms",

    "these values agree very well with those derived from fitting the upper precession frequency of the @xmath53sr data @xcite and prove the two - dimensional magnetism @xcite in the srfeasf compound . to find out the order of the magnetic phase transition , we fit the @xmath47 data according to the bean - rodbell model ( blue solid line ) @xcite for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the transition temperature if the lattice is not compressible , @xmath57 is the sublattice magnetization , and @xmath58 is a fitting parameter ( @xmath59 for a second order transition , @xmath60 for a first order transition and for @xmath61 the equation reduces to a brillouin function ) .",
    "the fitted values for @xmath58 , @xmath56 and @xmath47 are found to be 0.8 , 125k and 4.82 t , respectively . obviously , @xmath58 is a little smaller than 1 , which is different from that obtained for cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath62 ) , indicating that the afm transition for srfeasf is more second - order - like than that for cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 , which is in agreement with previous reports @xcite .",

    "the space group of the low - temperature phase ( cmma ) is a subgroup of that of the high - temperature phase ( p4/nmm ) and therefore a relatively continuous structural transition is usually the case @xcite .",
    "considering the small change in volume after the transition @xcite , it is likely that the charge density at the iron nucleus and the spatial distribution symmetry of the charges exhibit negligible changes .",
    "therefore , one may not expect distinct changes in @xmath63 and nqcc near the structural transition temperature range .",
    "interestingly , upon cooling through the afm transition , the nqcc jumps to a much smaller value for the afm phase while the temperature dependence of @xmath63 still follows the debye model without any evident jump .",
    "the isomer shift changes rather smoothly with decreasing temperature through the afm transition was also observed in the gdfeaso compound @xcite in contrast to that for the 122-type cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 material where a small jump was detected @xcite .",
    "this could be understood as due to some charge redistribution effect , which changes the efg at the iron nucleus while has little effect on the absolute charge density at the iron nucleus .",
    "in fact , charge redistribution effect have also been observed in 122-type aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite and 111-type nafeas @xcite systems and high - t@xmath68 cuprates materials @xcite .    to get a better understanding of the charge redistribution effect , we calculate the efg and the electronic properties of the srfeasf compound . for tetragonal ( p4/nmm ) srfeasf ,",

    "the experimental and numerical results are shown in table i. the sign of @xmath14 for nm - p4/nmm and nm - cmma phases can not be determined experimentally and the absolute values are given .",
    "for the magnetically split afm state , the sign of @xmath14 can be established directly in this case to be negative , which agrees well with first - principles calculations .",
    "this is different with other iron - based superconductors , where the sign of @xmath14 is obtained to be positive @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference certainly deserves future investigations .",
    "as can be seen , if we consider the absolute values of @xmath14 , the tendency of the calculated results match reasonably well with the experimental results .",
    "the @xmath72 values are almost the same for nm - p4/nmm phase and the nm - cmma phase . while the @xmath72 value for the afm - cmma phase is significantly smaller than the value for the other two phases .",
    "generally , the efg is sensitive to structural changes and is taken as a good probe for structural transitions .",
    "our observations , however , indicate that the structural transition from the p4/nmm phase to the cmma phase in srfeasf has no obvious effect on the efg , but the introduction of long - range magnetic order unambiguously reduces the @xmath72 value of srfeasf .",

    "we calculated the nonspherical numbers of @xmath29 and @xmath30 charges inside the @xmath79 of the fe atom , denoted as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . @xmath75 and @xmath76 quantify the deviations of the charge distribution from spherical symmetry and are calculated as : @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 with the state of energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ calc1 ] ( b ) .",
    "obviously , the fluctuation of @xmath76 is much more pronounced than that of @xmath75 , indicating stronger anisotropic spatial distribution of fe-3@xmath30 electrons compared with that of the fe-3@xmath29 electrons .",
    "this can be explained by the strong hybridization between fe-3@xmath29 and as-4@xmath82 orbits , which reduces the spatial anisotropy of the fe-3@xmath29 charges .",
    "the decrease of @xmath76 in the afm phase can be understood from the calculated density of states ( dos ) of the iron atom for the three structures .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ calc2 ] , the partial dos of fe-@xmath83 sub - orbitals for the two nm phases almost has the same graphics features in the energy range from -5.0ev to the fermi level .",

    "the differences in the dos of the afm state are quite distinct .",
    "obviously , the @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 orbitals control the symmetry of the fermi surface in nm phases , yet the dos is much reduced in the afm phase , resulting in a much smaller fermi surface @xcite . besides , the gravity centers of all five @xmath30 orbitals are closer to each other in energy , yielding more isotropic spatial distribution of @xmath30 electrons .",

    "it is well known that the magnetic moment of the afm - cmma phase mainly comes from the spin polarization of fe-@xmath83 electrons .",

    "<S> the relationship between spin , electron , and crystal structure has been one of the foremost issues in understanding the superconducting mechanism since the discovery of iron - based high temperature superconductors . here , we report mssbauer and first - principles calculations studies of the parent compound srfeasf with the largest temperature gap ( @xmath050k ) between the structural and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transitions . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that the structural transition has little effect on the electronic structure of the compound srfeasf while the development of the afm order induces a redistribution of the charges near the fermi level .    </S>",
