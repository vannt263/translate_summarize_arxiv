    "communications and network coding ( nc ) have recently emerged as strong candidate technologies for many future wireless applications , such as relay  aided cellular networks @xcite , @xcite . since their inception in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", they have been extensively studied to improve performance and throughput of wireless networks , respectively . in particular , theory and experiments",
    "have shown that they can be extremely useful for wireless networks with disruptive channel and connectivity conditions @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , similar to many other technologies , multi ",
    "hop / cooperative communications and nc are not without limitations @xcite , @xcite . due to practical hardware limitations , _",
    "e.g. _ , the half  duplex constraint , relay transmissions consume extra bandwidth , which implies that using cooperative diversity typically results in a loss of system throughput @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", nc is very susceptible to transmission errors caused by noise , fading , and interference .",
    "in fact , the algebraic operations performed at the network nodes introduce some packet dependencies in a way that the injection of even a single erroneous packet has the potential to corrupt every packet received at the destination @xcite , @xcite . due to their complementary merits and limitations",
    ", it seems very natural to synergically exploit cooperation and nc to take advantage of their key benefits while overcoming their limitations .",
    "for example , nc can be an effective enabler to recover the throughput loss experienced by multi ",
    "hop / cooperative networking , while the redundancy inherently provided by cooperation might significantly help to alleviate the error propagation problem that arises when mixing the packets @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "multi  source multi  relay networks , which exploit cooperation and nc for performance and throughput improvement , are receiving an always increasing interest for their inherent flexibility to achieving excellent performance and diversity / multiplexing tradeoffs @xcite@xcite . more specifically ,",
    "considerable attention is currently devoted to understanding the achievable performance of such networks when both cooperation and nc operations are pushed down to the physical layer , and their joint design and optimization are closely tied to conventional physical layer functionalities , such as modulation , channel coding , and receiver design @xcite , @xcite . in particular , how to tackle the error propagation problem to guaranteeing a given quality  of  service requirement , _",
    "e.g. _ , a distributed diversity order , plays a crucial role when these networks are deployed in error ",
    "prone environments , _",
    "e.g. _ , in a wireless context .",
    "for example , simple case studies in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that a diversity loss occurs if cooperative protocols or detection algorithms are not adequately designed . to counteract this issue ,",
    "many solutions have been proposed in the literature , which can be divided in two main categories : i ) adaptive ( or dynamic ) solutions , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which avoid unnecessary error propagation that can be caused when encoding and forwarding erroneous data packets ; and ii ) non  adaptive solutions _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which allow erroneous packets to propagate through the network but exploit optimal detection mechanisms at the destination to counteract the error propagation .",
    "each category has its own merits and limitations .",
    "adaptive solutions rely , in general , on the following assumptions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : a ) network code and cooperative strategy are adapted to the channel conditions and to the outcome / reliability of the detection process at the relay nodes .",
    "this requires some overhead , since the network code must be communicated to the destination for correct detection ; b ) powerful enough channel codes at the physical later are assumed to guaranteeing that the error performance is dominated by outage events ( according to the shannon definition of outage capacity ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii ) ; and c ) the adoption of ideal cyclic redundancy check ( crc ) mechanisms for error detection , which guarantees that a packet is either dropped or injected into the network without errors ( _ i.e. _ , erasure channel model ) .",
    "however , recent results have shown that , in addition to be highly spectral inefficient as an entire packet is blocked if just one bit is in error , relaying based on crc might not be very effective in block  fading channels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an interesting link  adaptive solution , which does not require crc for error detection and avoids full  csi ( channel state information ) information at the relays , has been proposed in @xcite . therein , the achievable diversity ( using the singleton bound ) is studied under the assumption that _ ad hoc _ interleavers are used , while no analysis of the coding gain is conducted .",
    "non  adaptive solutions rely , in general , on the following assumptions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : a ) neither error correction nor error detection mechanisms are needed at the physical layer , but the relays just regenerate the incoming packets and forward them to the final destination ( _ i.e. _ , error channel model ) .",
    "this results in a simple design of the relay nodes , as well as in a spectral efficient transmission scheme as the received packets are never blocked ; and b ) the possibility to receive packets with errors needs powerful detection mechanisms at the destination , which require csi of the whole network to counteract the error propagation problem and to achieve full  diversity .",
    "similar to adaptive solutions , this requires some overhead .",
    "as far as adaptive solutions are concerned , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have recently provided a comprehensive study of the diversity / multiplexing tradeoff for general multi  source multi  relay networks , and have shown that the design of diversity  achieving network codes is equivalent to the design of systematic maximum distance separable ( mds ) codes for erasure channels .",
    "thus , well  established and general methods for the design of network codes exist , which can be borrowed from classical coding theory . on the other hand , as far as non  adaptive solutions are concerned ,",
    "theoretical analysis and guidelines for system optimization are available only for specific network topologies and network codes . to the best of the authors knowledge , a general framework for performance analysis and code design over fading channels is still missing .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we focus our attention on non  adaptive solutions with a threefold objective : i ) to develop a general analytical framework to compute the average bit error probability ( abep ) of multi  source multi  relay cooperative networks with arbitrary binary encoding vectors and realistic channel conditions over all the wireless links ; ii ) to provide guidelines for network code design to achieve a given diversity and coding gain tradeoff ; and iii ) to understand the impact of the error propagation problem and the role played by csi at the destination on the achievable diversity order and coding gain .    more specifically , by carefully looking at recent literature related to the performance analysis and code design for non  adaptive solutions , the following contributions are worth being mentioned : i ) in @xcite , the authors study a simple three ",
    "node network without nc ( a simple repetition code is considered ) and they show that instantaneous csi is needed at the destination to achieve full  diversity .",
    "no closed  form expression of the coding gain is given ; ii ) in @xcite and @xcite , the authors introduce and study complex field network coding ( cfnc ) , which does not rely on galois field operations and exploit interference and multi  user detection to increase throughput and diversity .",
    "the analysis is valid for arbitrary network topologies .",
    "however , only the diversity order is computed analytically , while the coding gain is studied by simulation ; iii ) in @xcite , the authors study a simple three ",
    "node network with binary nc . unlike other papers , channel coding is considered in the analysis . however ,",
    "the error performance is mainly estimated through monte carlo simulations ; iv ) in @xcite , the author considers multiple relay nodes but a simple repetition code is used ( no nc ) .",
    "main contribution is the study of the impact of channel estimation errors on the achievable diversity ; v ) in @xcite , the authors study a network topology with multiple sources but with just one relay .",
    "also , a very specific network code is analyzed .",
    "this paper provides a simple and effective method to accurately computing the coding gain of error  prone cooperative networks with nc ;",
    "vi ) in @xcite , the authors analyze generic multi  source multi  relay networks with binary nc , but error  free source  to  relay links are considered , and the performance ( coding gain ) is computed by using monte carlo simulations ; vii ) in @xcite and @xcite , we have studied the performance of network  coded cooperative networks with realistic source  to  relay wireless channels . however , the analysis is useful only for two  source two  relay networks and for a very specific binary network code ; viii ) in @xcite , a general framework to study the abep for arbitrary modulation schemes is provided , but a simple three  node network without nc is considered ; and ix ) in @xcite , the authors study a three  node network with a simple repetition code .",
    "exact results are provided for coding gain and diversity order .",
    "finally , in @xcite and @xcite , nc with error ",
    "prone source  to  relay links is studied , but the analysis is applicable only to noisy channels , while channel fading and distributed diversity issues are not investigated .",
    "according to this up  to  date analysis of the state  of  the  art , it follows that no general framework for performance analysis and design of non  adaptive solutions exists in the literature , which is useful for generic network topologies , for arbitrary encoding vectors , and which provides an accurate characterization of diversity order and coding gain as a function of the csi available at the destination .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we focus our attention on a general multi  source multi  relay network with realistic and error  prone channels over all the wireless links . for analytical tractability ( and to keep the implementation complexity of relays at a low level @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "we consider a binary network code , a binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) modulation , and the demodulate  and  forward ( demf ) relay protocol . with these assumptions ,",
    "the main contributions and outcomes of this paper are as follows : i ) a maximum  likelihood ( ml ) optimum demodulator is proposed , which allows the destination to exploit the distributed diversity inherently provided by cooperation and nc .",
    "the demodulator takes into account demodulation errors that might occur at the relay nodes , as well as forwarding and nc operations .",
    "it is shown that the demodulator resembles a chase combiner @xcite with hard ",
    "decision decoding at the physical layer ; ii ) a simple but accurate framework to compute the end  to  end abep of each source is proposed .",
    "the framework provides a closed  form expression of diversity order and coding gain , and it clearly highlights the impact of error propagation and nc on the end  to  end performance ; iii ) it is proved that each source node can achieve a diversity order that is equal to the separation vector @xcite , @xcite of the network code . in particular , it is shown that the optimization of network codes is equivalent to the design of systematic linear block codes for fully  interleaved fading channels , and that equal and unequal error protection ( eep / uep ) properties are preserved @xcite ; and iv ) the impact of csi at the destination is studied , and it is shown that half of the diversity order is lost if the destination is unable to account for possible demodulation errors at the relays .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ systemmodel ] , network topology and system model are introduced . in section [ receiverdesign ] , the ml  optimum demodulator that accounts for demodulation errors at the relays is proposed . in section [ frameworkabep ] , a closed  form expression of the end  to  end abep is given . in section [ diversitycodinggain ] , diversity order and coding gain are studied for arbitrary binary network codes and network topologies . in section",
    "[ results ] , numerical results are presented to substantiate analysis and findings .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "we consider a generic multi ",
    "source multi  relay network with @xmath0 sources ( @xmath1 for @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 relays ( @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) , and , without loss of generality , a single destination @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the baseline time division multiple access ( tdma ) protocol , where each transmission takes place in a different time ",
    "slot , and multiple  access interference can be neglected @xcite .",
    "we assume that direct links between sources and destination exist , and that the relays help the sources to deliver the information packets to the final destination .",
    "the cooperative protocol is composed of two main phases : i ) the broadcasting phase ; and ii ) the relaying phase . during the first phase ,",
    "the source @xmath1 transmits the information packet intended to the destination in time  slot @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "these @xmath0 packets are overheard by the @xmath3 relays too , which store them in their buffers for further processing .",
    "this phase lasts @xmath0 time  slots . during the second phase ,",
    "the relay @xmath4 forwards a linear combination , _",
    "i.e. _ , nc is applied @xcite , of some received packets to the destination in time ",
    "slot @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a non  adaptive demf relay protocol , which means that each relay demodulates the received packets , but perform nc and forward them regardless of their reliability . as a result",
    ", packets with erroneous bits can be injected into the network",
    ". however , these packets can be adequately used at the destination , by exploiting advanced detection and signal processing algorithms at the physical layer , to improve the system performance @xcite . according to the working operation of the protocol , broadcasting and relaying phases last @xmath11 time",
    " slots . since",
    "@xmath0 information packets are transmitted by the sources , the protocol offers a fixed rate , @xmath12 , that is equal to @xmath13 . in this paper , we are interested in understanding how the operations , _",
    "i.e. _ , nc , performed at the relays affect the end  to  end performance for this given rate .",
    "main objective is understanding the performance of cooperative networks with nc when physical layer terminologies are exploited to counteract the error propagation problem @xcite , and , more specifically , when demodulation and network decoding are jointly performed at the destination ( _ i.e. _ , cross  layer decoding ) . for analytical tractability and simplicity ,",
    "we retain three main reasonable assumptions : i ) uncoded transmissions with no channel coding are considered .",
    "accordingly , there is no loss of generality in considering symbol  by  symbol transmission .",
    "some preliminary results with channel coding are available in @xcite ; ii ) bpsk modulation is assumed to keep the analytical complexity at a low level ; and iii ) binary nc at the relays is investigated .",
    "however , unlike many current papers in the literature , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein , no assumption about the encoding vectors is made .",
    "these assumptions are widespread used in related literature _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .      according to the assumptions above , the generic source @xmath1 broadcasts , in time ",
    "slot @xmath7 , a bpsk  modulated signal , @xmath14 , with average energy @xmath15 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the bit emitted by @xmath1 .",
    "then , the signals received at relays @xmath4 for @xmath10 and destination @xmath6 are : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fading coefficient from node @xmath20 to node @xmath21 , which is a circular symmetric complex gaussian random variable ( rv ) with zero mean and variance @xmath22 per dimension ( rayleigh fading , we provide some comments on how to extend the analysis to other fading distributions . ] ) . owing to the distributed nature of the network , independent but non  identically identically distributed ( i.n.i.d . ) fading is considered .",
    "in particular , let @xmath23 be the distance between nodes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath24 be the path  loss exponent , we have @xmath25 @xcite , @xcite . also , @xmath26 is the complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the input of node @xmath21 and related to the transmission from node @xmath20 to node @xmath21 .",
    "the awgn in different time slots is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with zero mean and variance @xmath27 per dimension .    upon reception of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in time ",
    "slot @xmath7 , the relay @xmath4 for @xmath10 and the destination @xmath6 demodulate these received signals by using the ml  optimum criterion , as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the demodulated bit and @xmath32 denotes the trial bit used in the hypothesis  testing problem .",
    "more specifically , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the estimates of @xmath35 at relay @xmath4 for @xmath10 , and at destination @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we note that ( [ eq_2 ] ) needs csi about the source  to  relay and the relay  to  destination channels at relay and destination nodes , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we assume that csi is perfectly known at the receiver while it is not known at the transmitter .",
    "this is obtained through adequate training @xcite .    after estimating @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", the destination @xmath6 keeps the demodulated bit for further processing , as described in section [ receiverdesign ] , while the relays initiate the relaying phase .",
    "more specifically , the generic relay , @xmath4 , performs the following three operations : i ) it applies binary nc on the set of demodulated bits @xmath33 for @xmath2 ; ii ) it remodulates the network ",
    "coded bit by using bpsk modulation ; and iii ) it transmits the modulated bit to the destination @xmath6 during time ",
    "slot @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "once again , we emphasize that all the demodulated bits are considered in this phase , even though they are wrongly detected , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath36 .",
    "as far as nc is concerned , we denote the network ",
    "coded bit at relay @xmath4 by @xmath37 , where : i ) @xmath38 denotes the encoding function at relay @xmath4 ; ii ) @xmath39 denotes exclusive or ( xor ) operations ; and iii ) @xmath40^t$ ] is the binary encoding vector at relay @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath41 for @xmath2 . from this notation , it follows that only a sub  set of received bits are actually network  coded at relay @xmath4 , _ i.e. _ , only those bits for which @xmath42 for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , our system setup is very general : no assumptions are made on @xmath43 for @xmath10 , and the encoding functions @xmath44 can be different at each relay .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand how a given choice of these functions affect the end  to  end performance , as well as to provide guidelines for their design and optimization .",
    "thus , the signal received at destination @xmath6 in time ",
    "slot @xmath9 after nc and modulation is ( @xmath10 ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "let us note that the average transmit energy of each relay node is the same as the average transmit energy of each source node , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath15 . this uniform energy ",
    "allocation scheme stems from the assumption of no csi at the transmitter .",
    "the impact of optimal energy allocation is postponed to future research @xcite .",
    "thus , the total average transmit energy for broadcasting and relaying phases is @xmath47 , while the average transmit energy per network node is @xmath48 .",
    "in this section , we develop a demodulator at the destination @xmath6 which is robust to the error propagation problem caused by forwarding wrong detected bits from the relays .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the main goal is to improve the end  to  end performance by jointly performing demodulation and network decoding . to this end",
    ", we exploit the ml  optimum approach , which is composed of two main steps .",
    "[ [ step-1 ] ] step 1 + + + + + +    upon reception of @xmath49 in time  slot @xmath9 , the destination @xmath6 computes : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the estimate of @xmath52 .",
    "two important comments are worth being made .",
    "1 ) at the end of broadcasting and relaying phases , the destination @xmath6 has @xmath11 estimated bits , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 for @xmath2 from ( [ eq_2 ] ) and @xmath51 for @xmath10 from ( [ eq_4 ] ) , which can be seen as hard  decision estimates of all the bits transmitted in the network .",
    "these estimates are exploited in _ step 2 _ , as described below , to retrieve the information bits emitted by the sources and by taking into account nc operations performed at the relays .",
    "2 ) hard  decision demodulation is performed before network decoding , but , as we will better show in _ step 2 _ below , the demodulator will take into account the reliability of these estimates when performing network decoding .",
    "similar to @xcite , we will show that this is instrumental to achieve full  diversity .",
    "[ [ step-2 ] ] step 2 + + + + + +    in this step we take advantage of physical layer methods to develop network demodulation schemes that are robust to the error propagation problem @xcite , @xcite , and , thus , to the injection into the network , according to ( [ eq_2 ] ) and ( [ eq_3 ] ) , of wrong demodulated bits .",
    "this demodulator can be seen as a generalization of diversity  achieving demodulators for cooperative networks without nc @xcite .",
    "the reader can notice that the proposed approach belong to the family of channel  aware detectors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "to the best of the authors knowledge , the only notable paper which has recently extended these decoders to cooperative networks with nc is @xcite .",
    "however , a single relay node and a fixed network code are considered in @xcite .    using the ml criterion",

    "two fundamental differences exist between the original chase combiner and ( [ eq_6 ] ) : i ) the chase combiner does not consider dual  hop networks , which means that all the packets reach the destination through direct links ; and ii ) the effect of error propagation caused by relaying and nc is not considered in the chase combiner .",
    "these two differences are very important for two reasons : i ) the detector in ( [ eq_6 ] ) needs more csi to work properly ; and ii ) the end  to  end performance of ( [ eq_6 ] ) is affected by relaying and nc operations .",

    "as suggested in @xcite , this issue can be mitigated by using near ",
    "optimum demodulation methods ( _ e.g. _ , sphere decoding @xcite ) , which attain ml optimality with an affordable complexity .",
    "3 ) the demodulator in ( [ eq_6 ] ) needs closed  form expressions of the cross  over probabilities @xmath78 , which , in section [ crossoverprobability ] , is shown to depend on the csi of the source  to  relay links , and on the nc operations performed at the relay nodes .",

    "in fact , by comparing ( [ eq_7 ] ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 9 ) ) , we notice that the cumulative error due to performing nc on wrong demodulated bits at the relay is equivalent to the error propagation problem in multi ",

    "coded data is the same as a multi  hop network with @xmath102 hops having fading channels given by the source  to  relay links .",
    "when adding the relay  to  destination link , the end  to  end network behaves like a @xmath103 multi  hop network . in other words , _",
    "proposition [ crossprob ] _ clearly states that the larger the number of network ",
    "coded sources is ( _ i.e. _ , the larger the number of non ",

    "in this section , we provide closed  form expressions of the abep for each source of the network .",
    "the framework takes into account the demf relay protocol and the characteristics of the network code .",
    "the departing point of our analysis consists in recognizing that , according to section [ systemmodel ] , the network code can be seen as a @xmath104long distributed linear block code , whose first @xmath0 bits can be seen as systematic information bits , and the last @xmath3 bits can be seen as the parity ( redundant ) bits .",
    "however , there are two fundamental differences between the system model under analysis and classical linear block codes @xcite , @xcite : i ) the system model in section [ systemmodel ] encompasses a dual  hop network , while state  of  the  art analysis of classical codes usually considers single  hop transmission ; and ii ) coding is not performed at the source nodes , but it is performed at the relay nodes . due to the distributed nature of the network code and the assumption of realistic fading channels , encoding operations at the relays are inherently error  prone , as shown in _ proposition [ crossprob]_. accordingly , new frameworks are needed to characterize the end  to  end performance of dual  hop networks with nc , similar to the many frameworks that have been developed for cooperative / multi  hop networks without nc @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that the frameworks proposed in @xcite and @xcite are not applicable to our setup since fading is neglected and no diversity  achieving demodulators are investigated .    owing to the inherent similarly between the system model in section [ systemmodel ] and",
    "distributed linear block codes , we use union  bound methods to compute the abep ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 12.44 ) ) .",
    "the main difference with respect to state  of  the  art frameworks is the computation of each individual average pairwise error probability ( apep ) , which must account for the demf protocol and for the error propagation introduced by nc .",
    "furthermore , in this paper we are interested in computing the abep of each source of the network instead of considering frame or codeword error probabilities , as it is usually done for linear block codes @xcite , @xcite .",

    "this explains the presence of all the other summations in ( [ eq_17 ] ) , along with the upper limit of each of them .",
    "the reason why the upper limit of the last summation is @xmath214 is due to the equality @xmath215 } , \\prod\\nolimits_{k \\in \\bar { \\rm \\mathcal{a } } } { { \\bf{p}}\\left [ { \\bar m_{\\left ( { { \\bf{c}},{\\bf{\\bar c } } } \\right)}^{\\left ( k \\right ) } } \\right ] } } \\right\\ } = \\min \\left\\ { { \\prod\\nolimits_{k \\in \\bar { \\rm \\mathcal{a } } } { { \\bf{p}}\\left [ { \\bar m_{\\left ( { { \\bf{c}},{\\bf{\\bar c } } } \\right)}^{\\left ( k \\right ) } } \\right ] } , \\prod\\nolimits_{k \\in { \\rm \\mathcal{a } } } { { \\bf{p}}\\left [ { \\bar m_{\\left ( { { \\bf{c}},{\\bf{\\bar c } } } \\right)}^{\\left ( k \\right ) } } \\right ] } } \\right\\}$ ] , and because only one of these latter terms is explicitly present in ( [ eq_16 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the need to compute all possible combinations of the indexes @xmath216 clearly explains the definition of @xmath171 in ( [ eq_17 ] ) .",
    "the only thing left is to understand why in each summation the index @xmath176 must belong to the set @xmath169 .",
    "the motivation is as follows . when computing the convolution in ( [ eq_16 ] ) , the total number of addends in the final result is @xmath217 .",
    "in fact , the convolution of @xmath218 pdfs is computed , each one given by the summation of two terms . among all these @xmath218 terms ,",

    "the remaining @xmath223 are grouped in pairs of two addends , as shown in ( [ eq_19 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , each pair reduces to only one addend as shown in ( [ eq_21 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the number of terms in ( [ eq_17 ] ) can not be larger than @xmath224 . in other words , when the cumulative inequality in @xmath169 is no longer satisfied , we can stop computing the summations in ( [ eq_17 ] ) .",

    "the reason is that at the network  layer we take into account the reliability of each bit through a demodulator that resembles the chase combiner @xcite ( see also section [ msd_decoder ] ) .",
    "_ comparison with adaptive nc solutions_. in section [ introduction ] , we have mentioned that another class of network code designs aims at guaranteeing a given end  to  end diversity order without injecting erroneous packets into the network . in these solutions ,",
    "the network code changes according to the detection outcome at each relay node .",
    "results and analysis in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have established a strong connection between the design of diversity  achieving network codes and linear block codes for erasure channels .",
    "more specifically , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that mds codes can be used as network codes to achieve distributed diversity for erasure channels .",
    "the analysis conducted in the present paper complements design and optimization of network codes for _ erasure channels _ to the performance analysis and design of such codes for _ error channels _ , where all the bits are forwarded to the destination regardless of their reliability .    _",
    "end  to  end coding gain_. as far as the coding gain in _ proposition [ codingdiversitygain ] _ is concerned , and unlike the analysis of the diversity order , there are differences between single and dual  hop networks with and without nc . in fact , in _ corollary [ apep_idealsr ] _ , we have shown that both demodulation errors at the relays and dual  hop relaying introduce a coding gain loss if compared to single ",
    "hop transmissions .",
    "thus , even though nc and relaying , via a proper receiver design , do not reduce the diversity order inherently provided by the distributed network code , they do reduce the coding gain , which results in a performance degradation that depends on the quality of the source  to  relay channels .",
    "however , this performance degradation might be reduced , and even completely compensated , through adequate network code optimization and design .",
    "in fact , _ proposition [ codingdiversitygain ] _ and _ corollary [ apep_idealsr ] _ provide closed  form expressions of the coding gain for both scenarios where we account for realistic and ideal source  to  relay channels . a good criterion to design the network code , _",
    "i.e. _ , to exploit the inherent redundancy introduced by nc , might be to choose the generator matrix of the network code such that the following condition , for each source node , is satisfied : @xmath325 it is worth being mentioned that , in general , the most important criterion to satisfy is the diversity order requirement , as it has a more pronounced effect on the system performance .",
    "the optimization condition in ( [ eq_37 ] ) can be taken into consideration if there is no reduction on the achievable diversity order for a given rate .",
    "finally , we emphasize that both diversity order and coding gain can be adjusted by adding or removing relay nodes from the network , which , however , has an effect on the achievable rate as shown in section [ systemmodel ] .",
    "the framework proposed in this paper can be exploited for many network optimizations , such as : i ) designing the network code to achieve the best diversity order and coding gain for a given number of sources and relays ( _ i.e. _ , for a given rate ) ; or ii ) designing the network code to have the minimum number of source and relay nodes ( _ i.e. _ , to maximize the rate ) , for a given diversity order and coding gain .    _ eep / uep capabilities_. the diversity analysis in _ proposition [ codingdiversitygain ] _ has pointed out that each source of the network can achieve a diversity order that is given by the separation vector of the network code . in other words , each source can achieve a different diversity order . in coding theory ,",
    "this class of codes is known as uep codes @xcite , and it can be very useful when different sources have to transmit data with a different quality  of  service requirement or priority .",
    "in other words , the network code might be designed to take into account the individual requirement of each source , instead of being designed by looking at the worst ",
    "case scenario only .",
    "for example , let us consider a network with three sources , with one of them having data to be transmitted with very low abep",
    ". looking at the worst case scenario , we should optimize the system , and , thus , the network code as well , such that this source has , for a fixed transmit  power , a very high diversity order .",
    "if we can not tune the diversity order of each source individually , we are forced to adopt a network code that provides the same high diversity order for all the sources of the network , which might have an impact on the achievable rate ( see section [ systemmodel ] ) .",

    "in particular , from @xcite we can recognize that the argument of the q  function in @xmath375 is the end  to  end snr of an af relay network , which takes into account the relay  to  destination link and the cumulative error due to combining , at the most , @xmath0 source .",
    "the number of sources that are actually network  coded depends on the number of non  zero nc coefficients @xmath376 .",

    "thus , @xmath256 simplifies : @xmath380 where : i ) the approximation in @xmath331 is proved in _",

    "the last expression in ( [ eq_4__lemma2 ] ) has a convenient structure that can be averaged over fading channel statistics .",
    "to this end , the following considerations can be made : i ) @xmath256 can be seen as the abep of a dual  branch selection combining ( sc ) scheme , where the equivalent snr of first and second branch is @xcite @xmath384 and @xmath385 , respectively ; ii ) both @xmath386 and @xmath387 can be seen as the equivalent snr of a maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) scheme with a number of branches given by @xmath388 and @xmath389 , respectively ; and iii ) the `` virtual '' sc and mrc branches contain independent rvs , as it can be verified via direct inspection .",
    "thus , a closed  form and high  snr approximation of @xmath256 in ( [ eq_4__lemma2 ] ) can be obtained by using the method in @xcite .",

    "_ proof _ : from the chernoff bound , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath399 , which is accurate for @xmath400 that in our case implies high  snr ( @xmath401 ) , the following approximation holds : @xmath402 where @xmath403 is a constant correction term , which is introduced to recover the coding gain inaccuracy that might arise when using the chernoff bound @xcite . the high  snr approximation in ( [ eq_3__lemma3 ] ) can be explained as follows . by direct inspection",
    ", left and right  hand side terms can be shown to have both diversity order equal to @xmath404 .",

    "the right  hand side term is the error probability of a mrc scheme @xcite with @xmath337 diversity branches at the receiver , which is known to have diversity @xmath337",
    "the constant ( correction ) factor @xmath405 is introduced only to avoid coding gain inaccuracies , which are always present when using the chernoff bound . since the goal of this paper is to accurately estimate both coding gain and diversity order , the accurate evaluation of @xmath405 is instrumental to estimate the end  to  end performance of the system .    to get an accurate , but simple and useful for further analysis , approximation we use first  order moment matching to estimate @xmath405 in ( [ eq_3__lemma3 ] ) .",
    "the motivation is that , as we will better substantiate at the end of this proof , it allows us to have a closed ",

    "<S> in this paper , a multi  source multi  relay cooperative wireless network with binary modulation and binary network coding is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the system model encompasses : i ) a demodulate  and  forward protocol at the relays , where the received packets are forwarded regardless of their reliability ; and ii ) a maximum  likelihood optimum demodulator at the destination , which accounts for possible demodulations errors at the relays . </S>",
    "<S> an asymptotically  tight and closed  form expression of the end - to - end error probability is derived , which clearly showcases diversity order and coding gain of each source . unlike other papers available in the literature </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed framework has three main distinguishable features : i ) it is useful for general network topologies and arbitrary binary encoding vectors ; ii ) it shows how network code and two  hop forwarding protocol affect diversity order and coding gain ; and ii ) it accounts for realistic fading channels and demodulation errors at the relays . </S>",
    "<S> the framework provides three main conclusions : i ) each source achieves a diversity order equal to the separation vector of the network code ; ii ) the coding gain of each source decreases with the number of mixed packets at the relays ; and iii ) if the destination can not take into account demodulation errors at the relays , it loses approximately half of the diversity order .    </S>",
