    "`` materials by design '' , the ability to design and create a material with specified correlated electron properties , is a long - standing goal of condensed matter physics .",
    "superlattices , in which one or more component is a transition metal oxide with a partially filled @xmath0-shell , are of great current interest in this regard because they offer the possibility of enhancing and controlling the correlated electron phenomena known @xcite to occur in bulk materials as well as the possibility of creating electronic phases not observed in bulk.@xcite following the pioneering work of ohtomo and hwang,@xcite heterostructures and heterointerfaces of transition metal oxides have been studied extensively .",
    "experimental findings include metal - insulator transitions,@xcite superconductivity , @xcite magnetism @xcite and coexistence of ferromagnetic and superconducting phases.@xcite     solid solution in plane of carrier concentration ( changed by sr concentration ) and tilt angle in @xmath1 structure but with all three glazer s angles nearly equal .",

    "our work is partly motivated by a recent report@xcite of room - temperature ferromagnetism in superlattices composed of some number @xmath2 of layers of lavo@xmath3 ( lvo ) separated by one layer of srvo@xmath3 ( svo ) , even though ferromagnetism is not found at any @xmath4 in the bulk solid solution la@xmath5sr@xmath6vo@xmath3 .",
    "our study is based on a previous analysis@xcite of the possibility of obtaining ferromagnetism in variants of the crystal structure of bulk solid solutions of the form la@xmath5sr@xmath6vo@xmath3 .",
    "a key result of the previous work was that ferromagnetism is favored by a combination of large octahedral rotations and large doping away from the mott insulating lavo@xmath3 composition . a schematic phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkpd ] .",
    "however , as indicated by the dashed line in the figure , in the physical bulk solid solution , doping away from the mott insulating concentration reduces the amplitude of the octahedral rotations so that the physical materials remain far from the magnetic phase boundary .",
    "the motivating idea of this paper is that in the superlattice geometry , octahedral rotation amplitude may be decoupled from carrier concentration .",
    "the rotations can be controlled by choice of substrate while the carrier concentration can be controlled by choice of chemical composition and may vary from layer to layer of a superlattice . in effect , an appropriately designed superlattice could enable the exploration of different paths in fig .

    "octahedral rotations in perovskites can be described using glazer s notation.@xcite in the coordinate system defined by the three v - o bond directions of the original cubic perovskite , there are 3 tilt angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 with corresponding rotation axes @xmath10,[010]$ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .",

    "@xcite the v - o bond lengths have not been determined but , as discussed in more detail in the appendix , our studies indicate that all v - o bonds have essentially the same length .",
    "further we show that a few percent differences have no significant effect on our study of ferromagnetism .",
    "in the rest of the paper we therefore ignore these distortions , setting all v - o bond lengths to be equal .",

    "we believe that this difference is responsible for the difference in phase boundary .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the possibility of ferromagnetism in superlattice structures of vanadium oxides derived from lavo@xmath3 and srvo@xmath3 .",
    "our investigation was based on the idea that ferromagnetism depends on an interplay between carrier density and octahedral rotation , and while these are coupled in bulk ( see the solid solution curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) they may be decoupled in the superlattice . in particular",
    ", the charge density varies across the superlattice , being lowest near the sro planes , while the rotation angle is controlled by the substrate .",
    "thus in an appropriately designed superlattice at least some portions of the system might be moved closer to ( or perhaps into ) the ferromagnetic region . in several important aspects",
    "this idea is consistent with calculations .",
    "we find that the local carrier density determines the local magnetic susceptibility ( see section  [ sec : cubicsuperlattice ] ) and the density / tilt angle relationship may be significantly altered ( see solid line and square points in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .    however , we find that the @xmath128 octahedral rotation pattern characteristic of experimentally discovered superlattices is in fact less favorable to ferromagnetism than the @xmath1 pattern characteristic of bulk materials ( compare the phase boundaries in fig . [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "thus while the general idea that an appropriately designed superlattice might provide conditions favorable for ferromagnetism thereby providing a potential explanation for the remarkable experimental report of room - temperature ferromagnetism in ( lavo@xmath3)@xmath38(srvo@xmath3)@xmath39 superlattices with @xmath166 by lders et .",
    "al.,@xcite ( even though there is no ferromagnetism in the bulk solid solution ) , our detailed findings are not consistent with the experimental result .",
    "our results indicate that designing ferromagnetism into a vanadate superlattice will require both large amplitude rotations about the growth axis and also substantial rotations about the other two axes .",
    "rotations about the growth axis arise from substrate - induced strain , so choosing substrates with smaller lattice parameter would be desirable .",
    "introduction of rotations about the orthogonal axes may be done by replacing the la with a smaller counterion such as y.    our study has certain limitations .",
    "the calculations employ a frontier orbital model which includes only the @xmath33-derived antibonding bands .",
    "dft+dmft calculations based on correlated atomic - like @xmath0-states embedded in the manifold of non - correlated oxygen states provide a more fundamental description .",
    "our previous work@xcite indicates that the two models give very similar results if both calculations are tuned so that bulk lavo@xmath3 is a mott insulator , but the implications of the full ( but computationally very heavy ) dft+dmft procedure for the superlattice problem remain an open problem for future research .",
    "further , our calculations are based on the single - site dmft approximation , which includes all local effects but misses inter - site correlations . while it is generally accepted that these calculations give the correct trends and qualitative behavior , the quantitative accuracy of the methods",
