    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been accumulating data since 2009 with no observation of new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) so far , placing strong limits on new coloured states in extensions of the standard model .",
    "for example , in supersymmetric ( susy ) models there are strong experimental limits on the first and second generation squark and gluino masses @xcite which imply that they must be at least an order of magnitude larger than the electroweak ( ew ) scale . within constrained versions of susy , where the stop masses are linked to first and second generation",
    "squarks masses , this can considerably increase fine tuning since the ew scale is very sensitive to stop masses , through the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions .    at the same time atlas and cms",
    "have recently observed a new state consistent with a standard - model - like higgs boson at @xmath17 gev @xcite , which is within the range for it to be consistent with the lightest higgs in supersymmetric models . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "this introduces further tension with naturalness since the light higgs mass at tree - level is bounded from above by the @xmath18 boson mass ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the large radiative contributions from stops needed to raise it to the observed value typically imply very large fine tuning .",
    "for example the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) @xcite has been shown to require fine tuning of @xmath20 if it is to contain a 125 gev higgs mass @xcite .",
    "here we consider fine tuning in an alternative class of constrained susy models which involves both an extra singlet field , denoted @xmath21 , and an extra @xmath22 gauge symmetry at low energy ( tev scale ) . as",
    "the singlet acquires a vev , denoted @xmath23 , it produces a @xmath24 term , denoted @xmath25 , and it breaks the extra @xmath22 gauge symmetry , giving rise to a massive @xmath6 boson .",
    "such models can increase the tree - level physical higgs boson mass above the @xmath19 limit of the mssm , due to both f - term contributions of the singlet and the d - term contributions associated with the @xmath26 , allowing lighter stop masses and hence reducing fine tuning due to stop loops . the exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath2ssm )",
    "@xcite is an example of such a model , inspired by the @xmath1 group . at tree - level ,",
    "the light higgs mass is given as , @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is the ratio between the two higgs doublets vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , @xmath29 is the yukawa coupling of the singlet field to the higgs doublets , and @xmath30 represents loop corrections .",
    "indeed , eq .  [ mh ] shows that the e@xmath2ssm allows larger tree - level higgs masses than the nmssm @xcite , which in turn allows larger tree - level higgs masses than the mssm .",
    "this means that the e@xmath2ssm does not rely on such a large a contribution from the radiative correction term @xmath31 in order to reproduce the higgs mass . as a result",
    "the e@xmath2ssm permits lower stop masses than either the nmssm or the mssm .",
    "in addition the @xmath29 coupling in the e@xmath2ssm can be larger at low energies , while still remaining perturbative all the way up to the gut scale , than is the case in the nmssm .",
    "one might conclude that this should lead to lower fine tuning in the e@xmath2ssm than either the nmssm or mssm , since the large stop masses are usually the main source of fine tuning in susy models .",
    "however , the origin of the extra term in eq .  [ mh ] is due to d - terms arising from the coupling of the higgs doublets to the extra @xmath22 gauge symmetry , and such d - terms also contribute to the minimisation conditions of the higgs doublets . indeed , as we shall discuss , one of the minimisation conditions of the e@xmath2ssm can be written in the form , [ mz0 ] c = -_^2 + + d , where @xmath32 are functions of @xmath33 which are of order @xmath34 , @xmath35 are soft higgs mass squared parameters and @xmath25 arises from the singlet vev .",
    "written in this form it is clear that the d - terms are a double edged sword since they also introduce a new source of tree - level fine tuning , due to the @xmath26 mass squared term in eq .",
    "[ mz0 ] , which will increase quadratically as @xmath36 , eventually coming to dominate the fine tuning for large enough values of @xmath8 .",
    "this tree - level fine tuning can be compared to that due to @xmath37 which typically requires this parameter to be not much more than 200 gev , and similar limits also apply to @xmath8 . with the current cms experimental mass limit for the @xmath26 in the e@xmath2ssm of @xmath38 tev",
    "@xcite it is clear that there is already a significant , perhaps dominant , amount of fine tuning due to the @xmath26 mass limit . in this paper",
    "we investigate this new and important source of fine tuning , namely that due to the @xmath8 limit , and compare it to the usual other sources of fine tuning in the framework of the constrained e@xmath2ssm ( ce@xmath2ssm ) @xcite . although the impact of a sm - like higgs with @xmath3 gev on the parameters has recently been considered in @xcite , fine tuning was not considered .",
    "in fact the present study here is the first time that fine tuning has been considered in any supersymmetric @xmath1 model with a low energy @xmath26 . to obtain the required higgs mass in the ce@xmath2ssm",
    ", it turns out that the sm singlet field , @xmath21 , must have a vev @xmath39 tev as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of the @xmath26 boson predicted by the model of 1.9 tev , which almost reaches the experimental bound of 2 tev @xcite .",
    "thus , all the parameter space we study respects the experimental limit on @xmath40 fixing @xmath4 , and taking specific values of the mass of the @xmath0 boson , @xmath8 , ranging from 1.9 to 3.8 tev we find that the current minimum fine tuning in the ce@xmath2ssm , consistent with a higgs mass @xmath3 gev , varies from @xmath41 , and is already dominated by the @xmath8 limit .",
    "however , this is significantly lower than the fine tuning in the cmssm of @xmath20 arising from the large stop masses required to achieve the higgs mass .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : section two provides a short overview of the e@xmath2ssm . then",
    ", the scalar higgs potential and the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions are discussed in section three . in section four",
    "we discuss the fine tuning measure we use , and derive a fine tuning master formula for the e@xmath2ssm with a brief description of our semi - numerical procedure of calculating fine tuning .",
    "section five is where we present our results and discussion , then we conclude the study in section six .",
    "the exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath2ssm ) is a non - minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm , which provides a low energy alternative to the mssm and nmssm .",
    "it is well motivated both from more fundamental theories due to its connection to @xmath1 guts , heterotic and f- string theory @xcite and at the same time as a low energy effective model , providing solutions to phenomenological problems .",
    "for instance , as mentioned in the introduction , the e@xmath2ssm allows a larger higgs mass at tree - level than in both the mssm and the nmssm , thereby requiring smaller contributions from loops .",
    "in addition it also solves the @xmath24 problem associated with the mssm by dynamically producing the @xmath24-term at the tev scale , without introducing the domain walls or tadpole problems that can appear in the nmssm .",
    "the e@xmath2ssm is based on the exceptional lie group @xmath1 .",
    "this contains both of @xmath42 and @xmath43 as subgroups , @xmath44 and hence also contains the standard model gauge group , which is a subgroup @xmath43 . a linear combination of the two extra @xmath45 and @xmath46 groups can survive to low energies , where it is spontaneously broken by a sm singlet field , @xmath21",
    "this generates the mass of the associated @xmath6 boson and the exotic quarks , as well as dynamically producing a @xmath47 term .",
    "the model allows right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos to have majorana masses at some scale between the gut and low scales .",
    "this is achieved by choosing this linear combination to be , @xmath48 such that the rh neutrinos are not charged under @xmath49 , hence it is possible to explain the tiny neutrino masses via seesaw mechanisms .    at low energies , the group structure of the model",
    "is that of the sm , along with the additional @xmath49 symmetry ,    @xmath50    the matter content of the model is contained in the complete 27-dimensional representation which decomposes under @xmath51 to ,    @xmath52    ordinary quarks and leptons are contained in the representations : @xmath53 and @xmath54 the higgs doublets and exotic quarks are contained in @xmath55 and @xmath56 the singlets are contained in @xmath57 , and finally the right handed neutrinos are included in @xmath58    moreover , the model requires three 27 representations , hence @xmath59 , in order to ensure anomaly cancellation .",
    "this means that there are three copies of each field present in the model .",
    "however , only the third generation ( by choice ) of the two higgs doublets , and the sm singlet acquire vevs .",
    "the other two generations are called inert . furthermore , in order to keep gauge coupling unification , non - higgs fields that come from extra incomplete @xmath60 representations are added to the model . as a result , a @xmath61 term , which is not necessary related to the weak scale , is present in the model .",
    "the full superpotential consistent with the low energy gauge structure of the e@xmath2ssm contains includes both @xmath1 invariant invariant terms and @xmath1 breaking terms , full details of which are given in @xcite .",
    "however as in the mssm it is necessary to forbid proton decay and therefore a generalsation of r - parity should be imposed , and additionally because the e@xmath2ssm includes three generations of every chiral superfield , there needs to be a suppression of new terms which can induce flavour changing neutral currents . to achieve this",
    "we impose either a @xmath62 symmetry ( model i ) or a @xmath63 symmetry ( model ii ) along with an approximate @xmath64 symmetry , under which all fields are odd except for the third generation higgs superfields , which may arise from a family symmetry@xcite .",
    "the @xmath64 invariant superpotential then reads , @xmath65 & & + \\dfrac{1}{2}m_{ij}\\hat{n}^c_i\\hat{n}^c_j+\\mu'(\\hat{h}'\\hat{\\overline{h'}})+ h^{e}_{4j}(\\hat{h}_d \\hat{h}')\\hat{e}^c_j+h_{4j}^n ( \\hat{h}_{u } \\hat{h}')\\hat{n}_j^c   \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & & + w_{\\rm{mssm}}(\\mu=0 ) , \\label{eq : suppot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the generations .",
    "@xmath21 is the sm singlet field , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the higgs doublet fields corresponding to the up and down types .",
    "exotic quarks and the additional non - higgs fields are denoted by @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .    finally to ensure that only third generation higgs like fields get vevs a certain hierarchy between the yukawa couplings must exist .",
    "defining @xmath72 , we impose @xmath73 . moreover",
    ", we do not impose any unification of the yukawa couplings at the gut scale .",
    "the scalar higgs potential is , @xmath74 + \\delta_{\\text{loops } } } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the gauge couplings of @xmath78 ( gut normalized ) , and the additional @xmath49 , respectively . @xmath79 and @xmath80 are effective @xmath49 charges of @xmath81 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "@xmath82 is the mass of the singlet field , and @xmath83 .",
    "the higgs field and the sm singlet acquire vevs at the physical minimum of this potential ,    @xmath84     + it is reasonable exploit the fact that @xmath85 , which will help in simplifying our master formula for fine tuning as will be seen in section 4 .",
    "then , from the minimisation conditions ,    @xmath86    the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions are ,    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    ".  [ mz ] can be written in the form , [ mz2 ] c = -_^2 + + d , where @xmath32 are functions of @xmath33 which are of order @xmath34 and we have written @xmath92 .",
    "written in this form it is clear that fine tuning will increase as @xmath8 increases .",
    "another source of fine tuning is the large @xmath93 term as mentioned in the introduction since satisfying eq .",
    "[ mz2 ] will require this term to compensate for any increase in either the second term ( term 2 : @xmath94 ) or the last term ( term 3 : @xmath95 ) .",
    "the increasing experimental limits on @xmath96 results in constraining the parameter space of the e@xmath2ssm such that only relatively large values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 result in successful solutions to the ewsb conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s5]-  [ fig : s10 ] ) .",
    "moreover , imposing universal boundary conditions , which is what characterises the ce@xmath2ssm , means that all low energy susy parameters can be expanded in terms of a few gut - scale universal and fundamental input parameters , namely ,    @xmath99    where , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are a universal scalar mass , a universal gaugino mass , and a universal trilinear coupling , respectively , and @xmath102 means taking the parameter at the gut scale ( in the results section , we refer to @xmath103 and @xmath104 as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively ) .",
    "this is accomplished by using the one - loop rges of the scalar masses , so that one can express @xmath107 at the susy scale , @xmath108 , as ,    @xmath109    then , it is possible to write ,    @xmath110    where , @xmath111 denotes the fundamental parameters , @xmath112 is the coefficient corresponding to each parameter , and is calculated numerically .",
    "@xmath113 is some factor , possibly , involving @xmath33 .",
    "whence , one can calculate ( analytically or numerically ) the sensitivity of @xmath19 to each fundamental parameter , and this leads us to fine tuning .",
    "to study the degree of fine tuning , a quantitative measure needs to be applied . here",
    "we use the conventional fine tuning measure @xcite , where the fractional change in the observable is calculated for a given fractional change in the input parameter ,    @xmath114    where @xmath19 is the mass of the @xmath18 boson instead of @xmath19 .",
    "both measures can be easily linked since @xmath115 .",
    "our choice was made to enable straightforward comparisons with the results in  @xcite . ] and @xmath111 is one of the fundamental parameter in the set @xmath116    for example , @xmath117 and @xmath118 correspond to a @xmath119 and @xmath120 tuning in the parameter @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "moreover , for a given point in the parameter space , fine tuning is the maximum value of fine tuning in the set @xmath121 , and is denoted @xmath122 ( or simply @xmath123 ) .",
    "this measure has been used extensively within the literature e.g. @xcite .",
    "some concerns have been raised in the literature regarding the use of this measure and its use is not universal with a number of alternative measures having been introduced and applied @xcite . the @xmath124 measure the sensitivity of the parameters to the observable and as such are very dependent on the parametrization chosen . in particular whether one takes @xmath125 to be the parameter or instead chooses @xmath126 introduces a factor two difference , and this factor two will then appear for every point in the parameter space . to remove this _ global sensitivity _ one can choose some normalisation @xcite on the @xmath127 , however this then introduces questions about the bounds on the parameters and the probability is not clearly defined or understood .    additionally the overall tuning is chosen by taking @xmath123 as the maximum of the individual sensitivities @xmath124 , but a proposed alternative is to combine them in quadrature , like uncorrelated errors@xcite .",
    "clearly these measures can differ substantially , but it is not obvious which should be chosen .",
    "a new measure@xcite defined tuning as the ratio of the parameter space volume ( defined by fixed dimensionless variations in the parameters ) to the same volume with the additional constraint that the dimensional variations of the observable are no greater than those of the parameters . as such this measure automatically combined the tuning from each parameter into a single tuning defined in terms of parameter space volume . for simple cases studied it was shown that this new measure was in greater agreement with the conventional measure than the alternative where the sensitivities are combined in quadrature , which might be understood as being due to large correlations between the individual sensitivities .",
    "finally all the measures described so far define tuning as a theoretical feature of a point in parameter space , measuring how natural a point is . as such these measures",
    "quantify how natural phenomenologically acceptable points are once experimental limits have ruled out points which were initially favoured as being natural ( or more natural ) . instead within bayesian analyses",
    "natural expectations for parameter space points , given by the prior distribution , are combined with experimental data to determine the probability defined as a degree of belief .",
    "if one must fine tune the parameters to get the measured values of observables correct , then this will correspond to only a tiny fraction of the total integrated prior volume , and therefore fine tuned scenarios should be automatically penalised .",
    "however in practice in mssm studies @xmath19 is often fixed to it s experimental value at the outset , reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space and missing the fine tuning . to fix",
    "this one can start off with a full set of parameters with the chosen prior distribution , unconstrained by ewsb requirements and then perform a jacobian transformation@xcite .",
    "the jacobian factor accounts for the missed fine tuning and introduces similar derivatives as those appearing the sensitivity criterion , so it then appears as an effective  fine tuning prior  .    in the mssm",
    "the conventional measure of fine tuning is numerically very close to this effective fine tuning prior ( see e.g. @xcite ) and has sometimes been used directly as a fine tuning prior @xcite , without directly calculating the jacobian factor .",
    "nonetheless the conventional tuning remains a very simple and useful measure and has continued to be used widely with the literature .",
    "we will employ it here for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "it is the most widely used tuning measure with which one can compare ; 2 .",
    "it gives a good approximation of the effective fine tuning prior ; 3 .",
    "it is simple to understand and apply ; 4 .",
    "it provides a better match to the more complicated multi - parameter measure @xcite than combining sensitivities in quadrature .",
    "in particular please note that the simplicity and wide use is very important since this is the first quantitative investigation into tuning in this model and therefore comparison to what has been done in other models is of greater significance . applying this measure",
    "provides a quantification of the severity of tuning in the model , shows which regions have the least fine tuning and could be used as an `` effective fine tuning prior '' in future bayesian studies of the model .",
    "having concluded the discussion on the motivation and suitability of this measure we now proceed to apply it in a quantitative analysis of fine tuning .",
    "to do so we first derive and present the master formula which gives the explicit expression from which the fine tuning is calculated .",
    "using equations  [ mz ] ,  [ sin2b ] ,  [ ms ] and  [ delta ] , we derive this master formula for fine tuning in the e@xmath2ssm written in terms of derivatives of @xmath128 and @xmath129 with respect to @xmath111 . substituting for soft masses here would unnecessarily clutter the expression and we note that these terms are numerically negligible since their contribution to fine tuning is very small ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that they will be multiplied by an overall factor of order @xmath131 ,    @xmath132 \\times   \\\\ & \\times \\left[\\sqrt{2 } \\frac{\\partial ( \\lambda a_{\\lambda } s ) } { \\partial a } - \\sin 2\\beta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a } ( m_d^2 + m_u^2 + \\lambda^2 s^2 +   \\frac{g_1'^2}{2 } q_s ( q_1 + q_2 ) s^2 ) \\right ] \\bigg\\rbrace , \\end{split } \\label{eq : master - formula}\\ ] ]    where c = , and @xmath133 for @xmath134 ; @xmath135    the aim is to expand the low energy parameters , including @xmath23 , in terms of the gut - scale universal input parameters using the e@xmath2ssm rges as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "next , the formula is implemented into a private ce@xmath2ssm spectrum generator ( described in @xcite ) and fine tuning at each point in the scanned parameter space is calculated . in order to ensure accuracy of the results ,",
    "the derivatives in the master formula for @xmath136 and @xmath137 are calculated numerically . and",
    "in order to calculate , @xmath138 we use @xmath139 where , as usual , @xmath140 is expanded in terms of the gut parameters .    finally ,",
    "throughout our study , we fix @xmath141 since larger and smaller values restrict the availability of @xmath3 gev , and the parameter space @xcite .",
    "the scans are taken for fixed @xmath142 tev corresponding to @xmath143 tev .",
    "we scan over -3 _ 3 ( 0 ) 0   0 _ 1(0 ) = _ 2(0 ) = _ 3(0 ) 3 while fixing @xmath144 and @xmath141 .",
    "the sign of @xmath145 is a free parameter in our convention since we are setting @xmath23 and @xmath146 .",
    "however as with previous studies @xcite we found that most of the parameter space is covered with @xmath147 , while @xmath148 covers a much smaller region of the parameter space .",
    "therefore we focused on @xmath147 in our study .",
    "the other gut parameters : @xmath149 and @xmath150 are obtained as an output so that the ewsb conditions are satisfied to one - loop order .",
    "then we plot both @xmath151 and @xmath122 in the @xmath152 plane .",
    "the key at the top - left of all plots corresponding to @xmath151 shows the central value in a bin of width @xmath153 gev , while that corresponding to @xmath123 shows the central value in a bin of width @xmath154 .",
    "moreover , we select a benchmark point corresponding to each value of @xmath155 these points possess the smallest fine tuning in the @xmath152 plane consistent with a higgs mass within the @xmath156 gev range , and @xmath157 gev .",
    "they are denoted as a black dot in figures  [ fig : s5]-  [ fig : s10t2t3 ] .",
    "these points and the relevant physical masses are summarised in table  [ table : benchmarks ] in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "cc    cc    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s5 ] the results for @xmath158 tev , corresponding to @xmath159 tev , are shown with fine tuning contours , ranging from @xmath160 to above @xmath161 for the highest @xmath97 . for each value of @xmath97 and @xmath98 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath162 , and @xmath101 take different values .",
    "since the higgs mass strongly depends both on stop corrections and @xmath29 , it will also take different values denoted by the higgs mass contours displayed in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s5 ] . since both fine tuning and the higgs mass vary over the @xmath152 plane the mass of the higgs discovered at the lhc plays a crucial rule in fixing the level of tuning , though this dependence is significantly more complicated than in the mssm .",
    "thus , although for @xmath158 tev the tuning can in principle be as low as 100 , in order to obtain @xmath163 gev the fine tuning must be more than twice as large as this .",
    "a benchmark representing points with the lowest tuning compatible with data shown as black dot in fig .",
    "[ fig : s5 ] having @xmath164 with @xmath165 gev .",
    "note that @xmath3 gev is almost impossible to achieve for @xmath158 tev ( represented by the very small green region in the right panel ) .",
    "in addition , the value @xmath159 tev slightly violates the cms limit @xmath38 tev @xcite , although this limit does not take into account the presence of lighter singlet states which increase the @xmath26 width and reduce the leptonic branching ratio , weakening this limit as discussed in @xcite .",
    "one also needs to take into account lhc constraints from squark and gluino searches which rule out @xmath166 tev corresponding to a gluino mass @xmath167 gev @xcite .    in appendix",
    "[ a ] we provide a set on benchmark points corresponding to @xmath168 tev and these benchmark points are denoted by small black dots on the figures .",
    "we emphasise that the ce@xmath2ssm has not been studied by any of the lhc experiments , and that the gluino mass limits in the e@xmath2ssm may differ from those of the mssm as discussed recently @xcite . therefore , in choosing our minimum tuning benchmarks , the limits we assumed are quite conservative . from the results in @xcite",
    ", we find that in the ce@xmath2ssm the gluino mass is approximately given by @xmath169 and the first and second generation squark masses are given by @xmath170 , depending on @xmath98 . in the future ( for example when the full 8 tev data set is analysed ) the allowed values of @xmath97 and",
    "@xmath98 are expected to increase according to these approximate relations .",
    "therefore , we show in appendix  [ b ] ( table  [ table : mgluinoft ] ) the minimum allowed fine tuning associated with gluino mass in the @xmath171 tev range , and the usual range for the singlet vev @xmath172 tev . clearly , the fine tuning in the ce@xmath2ssm is not as large as that in the cmssm , where increasing @xmath173 to 1.5 tev leads to minimum fine tuning @xmath174 as found in  @xcite , while it varies between @xmath175 in the ce@xmath2ssm .    at first sight , the distribution of fine tuning in the @xmath152 plane could seem counter intuitive since one might expect the region of smaller values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 to possess lower fine tuning",
    ". however , the variation of @xmath122 can be understood by studying which parameter contributes the maximum fine tuning at each point in the parameter space .",
    "we show this in fig .",
    "[ fig : s5t2t3 ] ( left panel ) where it is clear that the region of small @xmath97 and @xmath98 is dominated by large fine tuning in the parameter @xmath105 , resulting from a large @xmath93 term in this region .",
    "in addition , @xmath106 can contribute to @xmath176 since @xmath177 and @xmath82 are strongly dependent on this parameter .",
    "the physical origin of the fine tuning in @xmath106 is due to the loops of exotic d - particles which serve to radiatively drive the singlet mass squared negative which triggers electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , @xmath97 can be the source of fine tuning for very large values of @xmath97 which is the region extending beyond what we show in the plots .",
    "the relative fine tuning in the input parameters @xmath178 does not directly tell us any information about the relative importance of the second and third terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ mz2 ] , both of which can independently be large and hence lead to a large @xmath93 which is manifested as large fine tuning in @xmath105 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to directly compare the magnitudes of the second and third terms of eq .",
    "[ mz2 ] , where the former is proportional to @xmath179 and @xmath180 , hence sfermions , and the latter is proportional to @xmath181 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s5t2t3 ] ( right panel ) we scan the parameter space for @xmath158 tev , and for each point we show which of the two terms is larger .",
    "the larger of the two would be responsible for the fine tuning at the corresponding point .",
    "it is clear , then , that @xmath182 ( blue region ) not only controls the minimum fine tuning allowed , but also is the dominating source of fine tuning over large regions of the parameter space .",
    "this is true for all the other values of @xmath23 .",
    "however , some substantial contribution to fine tuning comes from sfermions as seen in the yellow region .",
    "cc    cc    as we increase @xmath23 to 6 tev ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s6 ] ) , we simultaneously satisfy the cms mass limit on the @xmath26 mass , with @xmath183 tev , and we obtain more points with the heavier higgs mass @xmath184 gev .",
    "interestingly , the benchmark point in this case has a fine tuning @xmath185 for @xmath165 gev which is slightly smaller than for the previous case with @xmath158 tev .",

    "supersymmetric unified models in which the singlet vev is responsible simultaneously both for @xmath25 and for the @xmath0 mass , as in the @xmath1 class of models for example , have relatively large fine tuning which is typically dominated by the experimental mass limit on the @xmath0 . to illustrate this",
    ", we have investigated the degree of fine tuning throughout the parameter space of the ce@xmath2ssm .",
    "in fact this is the first time that fine tuning has been studied in any @xmath1 model containing a tev scale @xmath0 .    to quantify fine tuning",
    "we have derived a fine tuning master formula for the e@xmath2ssm and implemented it in a spectrum generator for the constrained version of the model . using this we scanned the parameter space of the ce@xmath2ssm .",
    "the results are presented in the @xmath152 plane for fixed @xmath210 and various @xmath23 values corresponding to @xmath5 tev .",
    "this value of @xmath210 is the optimum choice for achieving a large enough higgs mass in the ce@xmath2ssm and",
    "so we have exclusively focussed on it here .",
    "we selected benchmark points corresponding to each value of @xmath23 which possess the smallest fine tuning while allowing a higgs mass within the @xmath156 gev range , and @xmath157 gev .",
    "they are the black dot points in figures  [ fig : s5]-  [ fig : s10t2t3 ] . these benchmark points and the relevant physical masses are summarised in table  [ table : benchmarks ] for a gluino mass of about @xmath211 gev . table  [ table : mgluinoft ] shows how the minimum fine tuning changes as the gluino mass limit increases up to @xmath212 tev . as remarked earlier , the fine tuning in the ce@xmath2ssm is always significantly smaller than that in the cmssm , for all gluino masses .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0 mass ( determined by the @xmath23 vev value ) has a significant effect on the naturalness of the ce@xmath2ssm model , with higher values leading to increased fine tuning .",
    "therefore future improved direct mass limits on the @xmath0 mass from the lhc will imply higher fine tuning .",
    "we have also seen an indirect relation between the higgs boson mass and the @xmath0 mass .",
    "for example if the higgs mass turns out to be @xmath213 gev then we are driven to @xmath214 tev corresponding to @xmath215 tev requiring higher fine tuning . conversely if the higgs mass turns out to be @xmath216 gev then @xmath217 tev corresponding to @xmath218 tev allowing lower fine tuning .",
    "given present limits , the results in figures  [ fig : s5]-  [ fig : s10t2t3 ] and table  [ table : benchmarks ] show that the present lowest value of fine tuning in the ce@xmath2ssm , consistent with a higgs mass @xmath3 gev , varies from @xmath219 where the allowed lowest fine tuning values , taking into account the relevant experimental bounds , are dominated by @xmath8 rather than the other sources of fine tuning .",
    "this is presently significantly lower than the fine tuning in the cmssm of @xmath220 arising from the large stop masses required to achieve the higgs mass .    in the future ,",
    "the lhc lower limits on gluino and squark masses will improve , along with the @xmath0 mass limit ( or else a discovery will be made ) and the higgs boson mass will be more accurately specified .",
    "it is not completely clear where the dominant source of fine tuning in the ce@xmath2ssm will originate from in future .",
    "however the results in this paper allow this question to be addressed .",
    "the future @xmath0 mass limit will determine the minimum @xmath23 value permitted , while the higgs mass and gluino and squark mass limits will determine the allowed regions of the @xmath152 plane , from which the fine tuning may be read off from the contour plots we provide .",

    "table  [ table : benchmarks ] lists the details on the masses and parameters associated with each benchmark ( bm ) point that was chosen .",
    "we can see that @xmath97 increases significantly as @xmath23 ( @xmath8 ) becomes larger , while @xmath98 is roughly constant . upon choosing a bm point",
    ", we imposed the limit @xmath221 tev to have gluino mass @xmath222 gev .",
    "the gluino masses for our benchmark points are about 900 gev or close to it , hence if the experimental limits on @xmath173 are to be increased for constrained models , then fine tuning will increase as well .",
    "the lightest stop , @xmath223 , masses range from 1.7 tev to 2.4 tev for the range of @xmath23 we studied , and thereby is above the experimental limits .",
    "as the lower limits on the gluino mass are expected to rise , table  [ table : mgluinoft ] shows the minimum amount of the fine tuning corresponding to different values of gluino mass within @xmath224 tev , and for @xmath225 tev .",
