    "let us focus on the main aspects of tunneling under nonstationary conditions .",
    "when the electric field @xmath0 acts on a tunneling particle of the initial energy @xmath1 , it can absorb the quantum @xmath2 ( with the probability proportional to the small parameter @xmath3 ) and tunnel after that in a more transparent part of the barrier with the higher energy @xmath4 .",
    "the pay in the absorption probability may be compensated by the probability gain in tunneling . in this case",
    "the system tends to absorb further quanta to increase the total probability of passing the barrier .",
    "this mechanism of barrier penetration is called photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "if @xmath2 is not big , the process of tunneling , with the simultaneous multi quanta absorption , can be described in a semiclassical way by the method of classical trajectories in the complex time @xcite .",
    "when a tunneling particle of the energy @xmath1 is acted by a short - time pulse , the tunneling probability is associated with the particle density carrying away in the outgoing wave packet .",
    "the particle energy after escape is @xmath5 , where the energy gain @xmath6 , should be extremized with respect to the number of absorbed quanta @xmath7 and the energy @xmath8 of each quantum @xcite .",
    "this mechanism relates to semiclassical method for nonstationary potentials .",
    "the semiclassical method in quantum mechanics is very elegant and constructive . on the other hand , this method is based on the delicate mathematical issue called stokes phenomenon when a solution is not expected to appear but it appears @xcite .",
    "this makes a use of the semiclassical method to be not trivial even in the case of a static potential .",
    "in this situation the role of exactly solvable problems in quantum mechanics is very important .",

    "is it possible to find an exactly solvable problem for a nonstationary potential ( excepting not interesting parabolic one , where the effect is trivial @xcite ) to see how the exact solution is reduced to complex classical trajectories under semiclassical conditions ?",
    "an exactly solvable problems would be extremely useful since the method of classical trajectories in nonstationary problems is still challenged and an exact analytical solution would place classical trajectories in the rank of mathematical theorem .",
    "such exactly solvable nonstationary problem exists .",
    "this is an inter - band tunneling ( zener breakdown ) in a semiconductor @xcite in a nonstationary electric field which is a constant in space .",
    "the latter condition makes the problem to be exactly solvable since in the momentum representation the schrdinger equation is reduced to the first order which can be solved by the method of characteristics . in this paper",
    "it is studied how the exact solution turns over into one corresponding to classical trajectories and under which conditions this is possible .",
    "the goal of the paper is not to investigate zener effect in real semiconductors but to use this situation to mathematically justify the method of classical trajectories .",
    "another issue of this paper is that a new mechanism of _ enhanced _ tunneling through static non - one - dimensional barriers is proposed in addition to well known _",
    "normal _ tunneling solely described by a trajectory in imaginary time . as shown in the paper , under certain conditions on the barrier shape and the particle energy , the probability of enhanced tunneling",

    ", this type of treatment of nonstationary tunneling is reasonable since a maximum of the outgoing packet should relate to some extreme condition .",
    "nevertheless , the approach ( [ 5 ] ) is schematic since a quantum interference between absorption and tunneling is neglected .",
    "what is a `` scientific '' way to account precisely a nonstationary field in tunneling ?",
    "we go towards this in [ sec : traj ] .",
    "according to feynman @xcite , when the phase of a wave function is big , it can be expressed through classical trajectories of the particle .",

    "at the point @xmath41 , besides an almost constant background , there is a wave packet of the outgoing particles shown in fig .",

    "the same relates to the field ( [ 4 ] ) which is singular in imaginary time .",
    "this means , formally , that arbitrary weak amplitude @xmath23 of a nonstationary field may produce a big effect .",
    "the arguments in [ sec : ph - as ] also show an increase of an effective @xmath23 in tunneling , but it is clear physically that an effect of an extremely small nonstationary field is negligible and the method of classical trajectories should not work in this case . as one can see , the method of classical trajectories is delicate and requires an accurate justification .    in the papers @xcite for the certain particular potential well and nonstationary pulses the wave function has been found in the form of expansion with respect to powers of @xmath11 @xmath65\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\hspace{0.1cm}s(x , t)\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the classical action .",

    "( [ 37 ] ) .",
    "as soon as normal tunneling is described solely by a classical trajectory ( [ 32])-([33 ] ) , enhanced tunneling , according to eq .  ( [ 38 ] ) , requires more complicated description .",

    "there are two issues in this paper .",
    "the first one is that the problem of inter - band tunneling in a semiconductor ( zener breakdown ) in a nonstationary and homogeneous electric field is solved exactly . on the basis of the exact analytical solution the formation of an approximation of classical trajectories",
    "is studied .",
    "this semiclassical formalism is very effective in tunneling under nonstationary conditions since it allows to reduce the problem to a solution of the newton equation in complex time .",
    "the semiclassical approach , obtained from the exact solution , is of the same type as in other problems of nonstationary tunneling which do not allow exact solutions , for example , decay of a metastable state , penetration through a potential barrier , and over - barrier reflection .",
    "the second issue relates to different types of tunneling through a static potential barrier if dimensionality of the problem is bigger than one .",
    "a multi - dimensional case has an essential feature which differs it from one - dimensional problem .",
    "namely , a tunneling coordinate @xmath177 can be influenced by non - tunneling one @xmath178 resulting in a different condition of interference of emitted partial waves during tunneling through the potential @xmath179 .",
    "a multi - dimensional tunneling can be interpreted as one - dimensional but in the nonstationary potential @xmath180 $ ] , where @xmath146 is the classical non - tunneling motion .",
    "this mapping onto dynamical problem enables to establish different types of tunneling .",
    "as well known , there is _ normal _ tunneling through a multi - dimensional barrier related simply to a classical trajectory in imaginary time and connected two classically allowed regions .",
    "this mechanism was always employed by authors in consideration of multi - dimensional tunneling .",
    "normal tunneling corresponds to the case when the tunneling particle does not absorb quanta of the nonstationary field .",
    "there is also a process when particle absorbs quanta ( photons ) from the nonstationary potential @xmath180 $ ] .",
    "this is a photon - assisted tunneling with an enhanced probability . in the language of the static potential barrier",
    ", this process corresponds to _ enhanced _ tunneling .",
    "this is a new mechanism of quantum tunneling through a static multi - dimensional barrier .",
    "depending on shape , sign , and value of the potential @xmath179 , two types of enhanced tunneling are possible : ( i ) with absorption of energy by the tunneling motion ( positive assistance ) or ( ii ) with emisssion of energy ( negative assistance ) .",
    "the positive assistance was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper for zener breakdown .",
    "the negative assistance was considered in ref .",
    "it is remarkable that the method of calculation of probability of enhanced tunneling , proposed in this paper , is applicable equally to both positive and negative assistance .    as it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for tunneling through a nonstationary barrier , the enhanced tunneling probability may be not exponentially small under conditions of negative assistance .",
    "this phenomenon is called euclidean resonance which results from influence of nonstationary field on interference of emitted partial waves during tunneling .",
    "euclidean resonance can also take place in tunneling through a static non - one - dimensional barrier . to get this phenomenon",
    ", one should adapt barrier parameters and the particle energy to reach the condition @xmath181 in eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) , as in the case of a nonstationary barrier @xcite .",
    "the above theory is valid if @xmath182 and when this condition breaks down one should use a formalism generic with the multi - instanton approach .",
    "nevertheless , the presented theory , as any other approach , can be approximately extended up to the limit of its validity @xmath183 wich relates to euclidean resonance .",
    "enhanced tunneling may result in a dramatic increase of a tunneling rate .",
    "for example , for an almost classical barrier , according to the normal mechanism , the tunneling probability is calculated to be @xmath184 , but enhanced tunneling , under conditions of euclidean resonance , results in the probability of @xmath185 .",
    "euclidean resonance is a phase phenomenon and any effect of dephasing ( friction , for example ) may destroy it . to avoid this destruction ,",
    "the attenuation time due to friction should be bigger compared to the under - barrier time .    in conclusion , a new mechanism of enhanced tunneling through static non - one - dimensional barriers",
    "is established in addition to well known normal tunneling . under certain conditions on shape of an almost classical barrier and particle energy , the probability of quantum tunneling through it",
    "may be not exponentially small .",
