    "while the nn interaction is traditionally acknowledged as a key building block in nuclear physics , the possibility of describing it using chiral symmetry and effective field theory methods has been a fascinating pasttime for nuclear theoreticians for more than 20 years as it offers a link to the underlying quark and gluon dynamics of qcd  ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "a crucial feature is the correct determination of the chiral constants @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 which appear both in @xmath3 as well as in @xmath4 scattering as a tpe contributions  @xcite",
    ". our purpuse is to extract them with errors from the analysis of the about 8000 scattering data collected from 1950 till 2013 .",
    "this is based in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : nn - abundance ] we show the abundance plots for a total number of 7709 pp and np data ( the total number of 8124 fitting data includes 415 normalization data provided by experimentalists ) , in the lab energy - angle plane .",
    "most high quality fits  @xcite which have historically been capable of fitting their contemporary nn scattering data with @xmath5 require about 40 parameters for the unknown part of the interaction . to understand the rationale of this ,",
    "the anatomy of the nn interaction below pion production threshold is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : nn - anatomy ] . the maximal cm momentum corresponding to the inelastic process @xmath6 , which is roughly @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a de broglie wavelength , which we identify with the shortest resolution scale @xmath8 . for comparison",
    "we also depict a free spherical wave , @xmath9 with @xmath10 relevant for nuclear matter .",
    "the idea is to coarse grain the interaction down to that scale . on the other hand ,",
    "nucleons are composite and extended particles made of three quarks , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , thus we must distinguish between the overlapping and non - overlapping regions as measured by the interaction .",
    "for instance , the classical electrostatic interaction the pp potential at a distance @xmath13 would be @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the proton electric form factor ( we take a dipole ) .",
    "thus , regarding em interaction the proton behaves as a point - like particle for @xmath16 since @xmath17 to be compared to the point - like value @xmath18 . for np one",
    "has @xmath19 compared to a vanishing point - like electric interaction .",
    "a similar situation happens for the strong part of the interaction .",
    "using cluster chiral quark model calculation  @xcite in the born - oppenheimer approximation with finite nucleon and @xmath20 transition form factors , one sees point - like spin - flavour van der waals interactions with ope and tpe _ above _ @xmath21 .",
    "likewise , one can also check that _ above _ @xmath22 the main contribution is just ope .",
    "this is consistent with the regularization used for ope in high quality potentials  @xcite .",
    "if we switch off this _ known _ piece , we are left with a _",
    "unknown _ potential with a finite range @xmath23 .",
    "for such a truncated potential , the maximal angular momentum needed for convergence of the partial wave expansion is @xmath24 . on the other hand , the minimal distance where the centrifugal barrier dominates corresponds to @xmath25 , which is @xmath26 for @xmath27 respectively .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath28 we can count the number of points between @xmath29 and @xmath30 sampled at a resolution @xmath31 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : nn - anatomy ] , which means @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "we count partial waves according to their threshold behaviour in coupled channels  @xcite , namely @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the tensor mixing waves .",
    "the number of parameters for an unknown interaction below @xmath37 and momentum @xmath38 becomes @xmath39 this counting argument does not consider that some parameters may be either accidentally small or turn out to be compatible with zero . a polynomial counting to order @xmath40 in momentum , gives a hermitian real potential @xmath41 with @xmath42 total number of @xmath43 parameters for @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the expansion has a convergence radius of @xmath45 , which is extended to @xmath46 after additive inclusion of @xmath47 exchange .",
    "thus for @xmath48 one needs @xmath49 exchange and just 9 coefficients  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to take @xmath50 and or @xmath51 .",
    "there remains the question on _ how _ to encode the _ unknown _ part of the interaction which should be sampled , or coarse grained , at least with @xmath52 resolution  @xcite .",
    "following a remarkable and forgotten paper by aviles  @xcite we have used delta - shell potentials for the inner _ unknown part _ to undertake a simultaneous partial wave analysis ( pwa ) to proton - proton and neutron - proton scattering data from @xmath53 to @xmath54 below pion production threshold up to lab energies of @xmath55 mev  @xcite following the pattern of fig .  [",
    "fig : nn - anatomy ] and taking a charge dependent one pion exchange ( ope ) potential above @xmath30 together with electromagnetic effects , vacuum polarization , magnetic moment effects @xcite .",
    "the delta - shell potential reduces the numerical effort tremendously and enables a fast determination of the covariance matrix whence errors can be determined and propagated for phase - shifts or nuclear matrix elements . with a total of @xmath56 fitting parameters we obtain @xmath57 .",
    "the consistent database selected in @xcite uses the improved @xmath58 criterion proposed by gross and stadler  @xcite which allows to rescue data which would otherwise have been discarded , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nn - abundance ] . data and other amusements can be found at the nn provider android app , available at google play store , see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nn - anatomy ] .    [ tab:1 ]    .complete nn database from pwa without rejection . @xmath59 . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we have also explored the role of chiral two pion exchange ( @xmath60tpe ) interactions at intermediate and long distances  @xcite .",
    "comparison of ope and tpe results are given in tables [ tab:1],[tab:2 ] and [ tab:3 ] . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we show the @xmath61 values corresponding to a direct fit to all the data . these large values prevent error propagation . in table [ tab:2 ] we show the @xmath61 values corresponding to a dynamical data base fit to all the data subjected to the @xmath58 criterion , so that the selection of the data depends on the potential .",
    "as we see , there is some improvement but data differ .",
    "finally , in table [ tab:3 ] we use the fixed and consistent data from the ope @xmath62 analysis .",
    "an acceptable @xmath63 with 30 parameters , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : npar ] ) , allows to propagate errors . in @xmath64 units we obtain  @xcite @xmath65 and a correlation @xmath66",
    "this result depends crucially on making the fit up to @xmath67 .",
    "one may wonder why should one determine nn interactions by fitting to higher energies than actually resolved in light nuclei .",
    "for instance , one can fit the @xmath68 and @xmath69-waves scattering length and effective ranges with just one attractive delta - shell  @xcite , yielding a triton and @xmath70-particle binding energies of @xmath71 .",
    "variational mean field shell model calculations yield binding energies for @xmath72he , @xmath73o and @xmath74ca at @xmath75 level when phases are fitted below lab energy , @xmath76 .",
    "this is so because the interaction becomes soft and short distance correlations become marginal . when the full amplitude is fitted in that energy range errors grow dramatically making for instance @xmath60tpe statistically invisible vs ope  @xcite .",
    "the binding of light nuclei does not depend explicitly on the high nn scattering data , but the _ accuracy _ of the interaction does .",
    "predictive power can still be achieved by solving the many body problem to this accuracy  @xcite .",
