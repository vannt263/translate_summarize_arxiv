    "as they traverse their orbits about the sun , comets slowly evaporate and fragment , leaving small bits of cometary debris along their orbital tracks .",
    "some comet orbits intersect the earth s path , and the planet sweeps up a portion of these particulates each year . generally , these particles are drawn into the atmosphere , where they burn up at high altitudes , producing the yearly meteor showers .",
    "a sample of the meteor showers expected on a regular basis for earth - bound observers is given in table [ earthshowers ] .",
    "a very detailed list of meteor streams encountered by the earth has been composed based on ground - based observations of amateur astronomers around the world @xcite .",
    "given the large number of meteor showers seen on the earth , it seems natural to ask about the possibility of meteor showers on other planets .",
    "it may be impractical for a sky - observer of the future to view meteor showers from some worlds : mercury has no atmosphere , the clouds of venus are so thick most meteors will likely burn up before a planetbound observer could see them , jupiter has no solid surface to sit on while viewing the shower , and so forth .",
    "never - the - less , predicting regular meteor showers on other worlds may be important for protecting explorers and spacecraft from incoming particles , and could be useful for planning expeditions and experiments to collect cometary material .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that future mars landers may be able to detect meteors from the surface of mars .",
    "a great deal of modern research has been devoted to analysis of the evolution of meteor streams in the solar system , particularly those that intersect the earth s orbit ( for example , detailed analyses of the evolution of the quadrantid stream can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; the geminid stream is analyzed in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses take into account perturbations to the orbits of the parent bodies , as well as the subsequent evolution of the debris trail after the comet or minor body has continued on in its orbit . over time",
    ", streams may wander into a planet s path causing new meteor storms , or may wander out the planet s path quenching a shower which has been periodic for decades or centuries ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite estimates that the quadrantid shower will vanish by the year 2100 ) .    to a first approximation , however , meteor showers will occur if the orbit of a planet and the orbit of a minor body intersect ( or pass close to one another ) . one way to determine",
    "if this occurs is to evolve the two orbits on a computer and watch for an intersection .",
    "a generalized method for finding the minimum separation between two orbits has been described by murray , hughes and williams ( 1980 ) , but the method reduces to a coupled set of equations for the orbital anomalies which requires numerical solution .",
    "alternatively , the methods described in this paper approach the problem of determining the intersection of orbital planes in a completely analytical fashion , requiring only geometrical methods and matrix algebra .    section [ sec : orbits ] describes the basic parameters and coordinate systems used to characterize orbits in this paper .",
    "section [ sec : rotation ] describes the rotations used to correctly orient two orbits with respect to each other , and applies the rotations to essential vectors needed for the analysis .",
    "section [ sec : intersection ] uses the rotated vectors to determine the intersection between two orbital planes , and computes the distance between the orbital paths when the planes intersect .",
    "section [ sec : shower ] proposes a criteria for the existence of a meteor shower based on the distance between the orbits at intersection .",
    "the `` time '' of showers meeting the criterion is determined .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] applies the condition of section [ sec : shower ] to 250 known comets , summarizes the results , and discusses the limitations of determining meteor showers using this method .    throughout this paper ,",
    "si ( _ systme internationale _ ) units are employed , except where the size of the units makes it convenient to work in standard units employed in astronomy ( _ e.g. _ , on large scales , astronomical units ( au ) will be used , rather than meters ) .",
    "as is well known , one of the great discoveries of johannes kepler was that the planets travel on elliptical paths , with the sun at one focus of the ellipse ( kepler s first law of planetary motion , published in 1609 ) .",
    "since then , an enormous body of knowledge has been developed regarding the analysis of orbital motion ( see , for example @xcite ) , allowing the determination of the position of virtually any object in the solar system at any moment in time .",
    "for the work presented here , a time dependent analysis of the orbital motion is not necessary .",
    "the only information which is required is a knowledge of the trajectory of the orbit through space .",
    "the distance of the orbital path from the sun may be written for elliptical orbits as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , @xmath3 is the eccentricity , and @xmath4 is the angle ( the anomaly ) between the body and the axis defined by perihelion , as measured in the orbital plane .",
    "the perihelion distance for the object can be found from eq .",
    "( [ rdistance ] ) by taking @xmath5 , yielding @xmath6    the distance expressed in eq .",
    "( [ rdistance ] ) describes the correct size and shape of an elliptical orbit for any object around the sun , but more information is needed to correctly orient the orbit in three - dimensional space .",
    "this information is typically collected in the orbital ephemeris , which expresses orbital parameters with respect to the plane which is coincident with the orbital plane of the earth ( the ecliptic ) .",
    "this paper will use a ( cartesian ) reference coordinate system defined in the ecliptic plane as shown in figure [ coordinatesystem ] .",
    "the @xmath7 axis is defined perpendicular to the ecliptic and in the right handed sense with respect to the earth s orbital motion ( _ i.e. _ , when viewed looking down the @xmath7 axis , the earth s motion is counter - clockwise in the @xmath8-plane ) .",
    "the @xmath9 axis is defined along the direction of the earth s perihelion .",
    "the orbital ephemeris of any body describes its orbit relative to the ecliptic plane , and locates the object along its orbital path as a function of time .",
    "for the problem of determining the possible intersection of two orbital paths , only three elements of the full ephemeris for a body will be needed : @xmath10 ( a _ modified _ longitude of the ascending node ) , @xmath11 ( inclination ) , and @xmath12 ( argument of perihelion ) .",
    "each of these parameters is described below , and shown in figure [ anglesdefine ] .",
    "the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath13 , is the angle in the ecliptic plane between the vernal equinox ( the first point of aries ) and the point at which the orbit crosses the ecliptic towards the @xmath7 direction ( `` northward '' across the ecliptic ) .",
    "the parameter , @xmath10 , used in this paper , is an offset longitude measured from the perihelion of earth , rather than the first point of aries ( see figure [ omegadefine ] ) .",
    "the inclination , @xmath11 , is the angle between the normal vector of the orbit and the normal vector of the ecliptic .",
    "lastly , the argument of perihelion , @xmath12 , is the angle between the position of the body as it crosses the ascending node and the position at perihelion , as measured _ in the orbital plane of the body_.    in addition to these three angles , it will be useful to define two vectors for each orbit of interest : @xmath14 , the unit normal vector to the plane of the orbit , and @xmath15 , the vector pointing to perihelion in the plane of the orbit .",
    "in order to correctly orient an orbit with respect to the ecliptic , assume ( initially ) that the orbit of interest is in the plane of the ecliptic , with the perihelion of the orbit aligned along the @xmath9 axis ( _ i.e. _ , the orbit is co - aligned with the earth s orbit ) .",
    "a series of three rotations , based on the angles @xmath16 from the orbital ephemeris will produce the correct orientation .",
    "the first rotation will set the value of the ascending node with respect to perihelion , the second rotation will set the inclination to the ecliptic , and the third rotation will move the ascending node to the correct location in the ecliptic plane .",
    "a useful method for describing rotations is in terms of matrices . while it is possible to construct a rotation matrix for rotations about a general axis , it is more convenient to conduct rotations about the coordinate axes shown in figure [ coordinatesystem ] .",
    "the matrices describing rotations about the @xmath17- , @xmath18- , and @xmath19-axes will be denoted @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .    to demonstrate the rotations needed to orient the orbit , consider a general vector , @xmath23 , which is rigidly attached to the orbital plane , maintaining its orientation as the plane is rotated .",
    "the first rotation locates the ascending node with respect to perihelion ; the rotation depends on the value of the argument of perihelion , @xmath12 .",
    "this is done by rotating around the @xmath19-axis by @xmath24 . in terms of rotating a general vector @xmath23 ,",
    "this can be written @xmath25 when this operation is applied to the orbit , the ascending node will be located on the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the orbit is inclined around an axis which passes through the ascending node and through the sun ( at one focus of the orbit ) .",
    "since the first rotation placed the ascending node on the @xmath9 axis , and the sun lies at the origin of coordinates , a rotation around the @xmath17-axis by the inclination angle , @xmath26 , will correctly incline the orbit . in terms of the vector @xmath27 ( resulting from eq .",
    "( [ firstrotation ] ) ) , this yields @xmath28    before the final rotation , it will be convenient to offset the longitude of the ascending node such that it is measured from the perihelion of the earth , rather than the vernal equinox ( this makes the @xmath17-axis the origin for measuring the longitude of the ascending node ) .",
    "the angle between the vernal equinox and perihelion of earth is simply the argument of perihelion for earth , @xmath29 , giving ( see figure [ omegadefine ] ) @xmath30    after the second rotation , the ascending node is still located on the @xmath9 axis .",
