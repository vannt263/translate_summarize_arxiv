    "the decades - old challenge of understanding the physical nature of laboratory spin glasses and the mathematical nature of spin glass models at low temperature continues .",
    "it is a paradigm of the wider effort to analyze the many novel features that occur in disordered systems generally .",
    "one can only hope that this effort will achieve some fraction of the successes that have been reached in understanding homogeneous systems  in and out of equilibrium  and that are epitomized by the work of joel lebowitz and his many collaborators .",
    "it is indeed an honor to contribute to this celebration of joel s first @xmath2 years ; may he live to @xmath3 .",
    "our focus here is entirely on the edwards - anderson ( ea )  @xcite model on @xmath4 , simplest of the short - ranged ising spin glasses , with hamiltonian @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes a specific realization of the couplings @xmath7 , the spins @xmath8 and the sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath9 only , with the sites @xmath10 on the square lattice @xmath4 . the @xmath11 s",
    "are independently chosen from a symmetric , continuous distribution with unbounded support , such as gaussian with mean zero ; we denote by @xmath12 the overall disorder distribution for @xmath6 .    in this paper , we restrict attention entirely to ground states , and further , to the lowest interesting dimension , @xmath13 . of course , for @xmath14 , and assuming as we do that the @xmath11 s are continuously distributed , it is easy to see that the multiplicity of infinite - volume ground states is exactly two  i.e. , a single ground state pair ( gsp ) of spin configurations related to each other by a global spin flip  since , in the absence of frustration , every bond can be satisfied in a ground state .",
    "we are interested in the question of whether there are infinitely many _ observable _ gsp s . by `` observable '' we mean that these states can be generated without using special @xmath6-dependent boundary conditions .",
    "this means that by using , say , periodic boundary conditions on the @xmath15 squares @xmath16 centered at the origin , for a sequence of @xmath17 s tending to infinity , also chosen in a @xmath6-independent way , the corresponding sequence of finite - volume gsp s for the finite - volume hamiltonians @xmath18 ( when restricted to a fixed , but arbitrarily large window about the origin ) will generate an empirical distribution , i.e. , a histogram , that in the limit is dispersed over many gsp s .",
    "to state a precise theorem about the gsp s that arise in this way , we need to explain the notion of a metastate  @xcite in this zero - temperature context .",
    "we will do this in the briefest possible way here , using empirical distributions , while delaying to later sections of the paper a discussion of the fact that there are alternative definitions giving rise to the same mathematical object .",
    "first , we note that for a given @xmath6 , with all couplings nonzero , a gsp @xmath19 may be identified with the collection of unsatisfied bonds , which we regard as edges in the dual lattice .",
    "now suppose that @xmath20 is a sequence of scale sizes , not depending on @xmath6 , such that for @xmath12-almost every @xmath6 , there is a probability measure ( called a metastate ) @xmath21 , defined on the configurations @xmath19 of gsp s on all of @xmath1 , which is the limit of the empirical distributions of the finite volume gsp s @xmath22 along the sequence @xmath23 as follows : let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be disjoint _ finite _ sets of dual edges , let @xmath26 denote the event that every edge in @xmath24 is unsatisfied and every edge in @xmath25 is satisfied ; let @xmath27 denote the _ fraction _ of the indices @xmath28 such that all the edges of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are within the square @xmath29 and such that the gsp @xmath30 obeys all the requirements of @xmath26 ; then for every such @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath31    thus a metastate for @xmath32 is an ensemble of infinite - volume gsp s that describes the asymptotic fractions of squares , along a subsequence @xmath23 , for which the various gsp s are observed ( when restricted to windows of fixed , but arbitrarily large , size ) within the finite - volume systems .",
    "it can be shown by compactness arguments  @xcite that such subsequences @xmath23 exist ; in fact every subsequence has such an @xmath23 as a further sub - subsequence . although it is a reasonable conjecture that any two metastates are in fact the same for almost every @xmath6 , no general result has been proved .",
    "however , this would be an immediate corollary of the following conjecture , at least for @xmath13 , which would also imply that _ the _ metastate is supported on a _ single _",
    "gsp for almost every @xmath6 .",
    "we note that recent numerical results are consistent with the existence of only a single gsp in two dimensions @xcite .    * conjecture 1 .",
    "* let @xmath6 be chosen from the disorder distribution @xmath12 and let @xmath19 and @xmath33 be gsp s chosen independently from @xmath13 periodic boundary condition metastates , @xmath21 and @xmath34 ( coming from subsequences @xmath23 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "then , with probability one , @xmath36 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the proof of the following theorem , which we regard as partial verification of the above conjecture  see the remark below .",
    "equality of two gsp s , @xmath19 and @xmath33 , is of course equivalent to the vanishing of the symmetric difference @xmath37 , the collection of bonds that are satisfied in one of the two gsp s and unsatisfied in the other .",
    "it is not hard to show ( see proposition 1 below ) that , at least for periodic boundary conditions , the symmetric difference must consist either of a single domain wall ( i.e. , a doubly - infinite self - avoiding path in the dual lattice ) with strictly positive density or else multiple nonintersecting domain walls which have altogether strictly positive density , but may have zero density individually . a priori , we felt ( and still feel ) that on a heuristic level , the former scenario for gsp multiplicity is the less plausible of the two .",

    "* remark . *",
    "although theorem  1 does not eliminate the scenario of multiple gsp s whose symmetric differences are _ single _ positive density domain walls , we suspect that such domain walls do not in fact occur .",
    "the proof of theorem  1 is based on showing that the presence of two or more @xmath38 domain walls would create an instability for both @xmath19 and @xmath33 with respect to the flip of a large droplet whose boundary consists of two long segments from adjacent domain walls , connected by two short `` rungs '' between the walls .",
    "the stability of @xmath19 and @xmath33 to such flips is controlled by the infimum @xmath39 of the necessarily positive rung energies  see equation  ( [ eq : rungenergy ] ) .",
    "proposition  3 of sect .",
    "4 proves instability by showing that @xmath40 , while proposition  2 there shows that such unstable gsp s can not actually occur with nonzero probability .",
    "if there were a single domain wall , it would be natural to expect that , like the rungs in proposition  3 , the `` pseudo - rungs '' that connect sections of the domain wall that are close in euclidean distance , but greatly separated in distance along the domain wall , could also have arbitrarily low positive energies .",
    "if these pseudo - rungs connected long pieces of the domain wall containing some fixed bond ( and we emphasize that these properties have not been proved ) , then single domain walls would be ruled out by an analogue of proposition  2 . the consequence would be that the periodic boundary condition  metastate in the @xmath0 ea ising spin glass would be unique and supported on a single gsp .",
    "the restriction to periodic boundary conditions in theorem",
    "1 can in fact be relaxed to allow other boundary conditions that _ do not depend on @xmath41_. for boundary conditions such as antiperiodic that are flip - related to periodic ones , nothing needs to be done , since they yield the same metastate  see section iv of @xcite .    to explain how other boundary conditions can be handled , we begin by noting that the significance of periodic boundary conditions is that they yield translation - invariance of various infinite - volume objects , which in turn is a crucial ingredient in the propositions of the next section . with periodic boundary conditions , translation - invariance is already valid for finite volume .",
    "for example , from the random pair @xmath42 , the finite dimensional distributions of finitely many coupling values and finitely many bond satisfaction variables are unchanged under translation by @xmath43 , as long as @xmath43 does not translate any of the finitely many bonds in question beyond @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , in the spirit of the empirical distribution construction of the metastate described above , one could rather consider the random pair @xmath44 , with @xmath45 chosen , uniformly at random , from @xmath46 . in that case",
    ", there is in a certain sense only _ approximate _ translation invariance for finite @xmath47 , since the bonds typically do get translated out of @xmath29 for small @xmath48 .",
    "but full translation - invariance is restored in the limit @xmath49 .    for non - periodic , but still @xmath41-independent , boundary conditions",
    ", one can somewhat similarly obtain infinite - volume translation - invariance , as follows .",
    "for each @xmath17 and @xmath50 , let @xmath51 denote the gsp in the translated square @xmath52 with some @xmath41-independent boundary condition , such as free or plus .",
    "next , let @xmath53 denote a uniformly random site in @xmath54 , where the deterministic @xmath55 with , say , @xmath56 ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) .",
    "then the random pair @xmath58 or , alternatively , @xmath59 , has approximate translation - invariance , which becomes exact as @xmath60 , or , alternatively , @xmath49 .",
    "using such an `` average over translates '' construction , one can obtain metastates coming from , e.g. , free or plus boundary conditions , for which the analogue of theorem  1 will be valid .",
    "such averaging over translates can also be used to obtain translation - invariance for the extended notions of metastates we describe next .",
    "an important part of the proof of theorem  1 is based on extending the notion of metastates so as to describe how a given gsp changes as the couplings in @xmath6 vary . of course ,",
    "if conjecture 1 were true , then , at least for @xmath13 , there would be , for almost every @xmath6 , a gsp @xmath61 , uniquely determined as being the one on which the periodic boundary condition metastate is supported ; thus one would know how @xmath61 changes even when _ infinitely _ many of the couplings in @xmath6 vary . but in general , since there might be many gsp s and perhaps even many metastates , it is not so obvious how to formulate the dependence of a given gsp in the support of a metastate even on _ finitely _ many couplings .",
    "neither the _ statement _ of theorem 1 nor that of our three main propositions requires this extension of metastates , but it will be needed for the proofs of the latter two of the main propositions . this extension will be presented in detail in section  5 of the paper , but we present a short exposition here , since it seems to be of independent interest . roughly speaking , the extension requires that we keep track of not only the gsp itself , but also of all its excitations in which finitely many spins are forced to take specified values , modulo a global flip .",
    "we note that recent numerical studies of spin glasses have analyzed excitations induced in this way @xcite and in more novel ways @xcite .",
    "there are two types of information about our excitations that one might wish to keep track of : ( a ) the minimum energy cost required to force the spins , and ( b ) the pair of spin configurations that does the minimizing  i.e. , the excited state .",
    "it actually suffices to keep track only of ( a ) , but it is perhaps conceptually simpler to keep track of ( b ) as well , and we will take that tack .",
    "suppose @xmath62 is a finite subset of @xmath1 ( in this discussion , we only take @xmath13 for convenience ) , @xmath63 is a spin configuration on @xmath62 and @xmath17 is sufficiently large so that @xmath64 .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the pair of periodic boundary condition spin configurations on @xmath16 with minimum energy _",
    "subject to the constraint that they equal @xmath66 on @xmath62_. if @xmath62 is empty or a singleton site , this is just the ordinary finite - volume ground state @xmath67 .",
    "we also define the excitation energy @xmath68 to be the energy of @xmath65 minus the ground state energy of @xmath67 .",

    "in this section , we present the three central propositions leading immediately to theorem  1 .",

    "the proof of the second and third propositions will be given in sect .",
    "we begin with a somewhat more detailed discussion of ground metastates than given in the last section . for simplicity , we continue to restrict the discussion to periodic boundary condition metastates , as in sect .  2 .",

    "that is , it must satisfy the constraint @xmath103 along any closed loop @xmath104 in the dual lattice .",
    "infinite - volume ground states are always the limits of finite volume ground states , but , in general , the finite - volume boundary conditions may need to be carefully chosen , depending on @xmath41 and/or the limiting ground state . in a disordered sytem ,",
    "if there are many distinct gsp s for typical fixed @xmath105 , then in general , as noted in @xcite , the limit @xmath106 does nt exist , if the @xmath17 s are chosen in a coupling - independent way .",
    "this phenomenon was called _ chaotic size dependence _ @xcite .",
    "the ground metastate , a probability measure @xmath21 on the infinite - volume ground states @xmath61 , was proposed in @xcite as a means of analyzing the way in which @xmath67 samples from its various possible limits as @xmath60 .",
    "( the metastate was introduced and defined for both zero and positive temperatures , but we confine the discussion here to zero temperature . )",
    "the same metastate can be constructed by at least two distinct approaches .",
    "the first , introduced earlier by aizenman and wehr ( aw ) @xcite , directly employs the randomness of the @xmath6 s , while the `` empirical distribution '' approach of @xcite and subsequent papers was motivated by , but does nt require , the potential presence of chaotic size dependence for fixed @xmath6 .",
    "the empirical distribution point of view ( and its natural extension to excitation metastates ) will be the primary one used throughout this paper .",
    "however , we briefly describe the aw construction , since it is the one that directly gives , for , e.g. , periodic boundary conditions , the translation invariance that will be crucial in our first proposition ; for more details see @xcite .",
    "here one considers , for each @xmath17 , the random pair @xmath42 ( where @xmath67 is the finite - volume periodic boundary condition gsp obtained using the restriction @xmath107 of @xmath6 to @xmath16 ) , and takes the limit of the finite - dimensional distributions along a @xmath6-independent subsequence of @xmath17 s , using compactness .",
    "this yields a probability distribution @xmath108 on infinite - volume @xmath109 s which is translation invariant , under simultaneous lattice translations of @xmath41 and @xmath19 , because of the periodic boundary conditions , and is such that the conditional distribution @xmath110 of @xmath19 given @xmath41 is supported entirely on gsp s for that @xmath41 .",

    "it is easy to show that there is sequential compactness leading to convergence for @xmath6-independent subsequences of @xmath17 s , as described above .",
    "we have conjectured @xcite that all subsequence limits are the same ; i.e. , that existence of a limit does not require taking a subsequence . proving",
    "this conjecture remains an open problem .    the empirical distribution approach of @xcite , as described in sect .",
    "2 , takes a fixed @xmath6 and , roughly speaking , replaces the `` @xmath6-randomness '' used in the aw construction of @xmath110 with `` @xmath17-randomness ''  i.e. , with chaotic size dependence .",
    "the empirical distributions along a subsequence @xmath112 are the measures @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the dirac delta measure at the state @xmath19 and where for convenience we regard the finite - volume gsp @xmath67 as defined in infinite volume by , e.g. , taking all bonds outside @xmath16 as satisfied .",
    "we say that @xmath115 has a limit @xmath21 if the probability of any event @xmath26 ( that every edge in @xmath24 is unsatisfied and every edge in @xmath25 is satisfied , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are disjoint _",

    "see @xcite .",
    "also see @xcite for additional properties of the metastate , particularly invariance with respect to gauge - related boundary conditions .    before we state proposition  1 , some additional definitions are needed .",
    "consider a periodic boundary condition  metastate @xmath21 ( in some fixed dimension , not necessarily two ) and two gsp s @xmath19 and @xmath33 chosen from @xmath21 .",
    "then their _ symmetric difference _",

    "the translation - invariance of @xmath122 in turn implies by the ergodic theorem with respect to @xmath129-translations that any `` geometrically defined event '' , such as a bond belonging to a domain wall , occurs either nowhere or else with strictly positive density .",
    "this proves the first claim .    to prove property ( i ) , we note that a domain wall taken from @xmath116 separates regions in which the spins of @xmath19 and @xmath33 agree from regions where they disagree .",

    "( we note , although it s not needed for the proof , that the number of branches emanating from @xmath131 must be even , again because domain walls separate regions of spin configuration agreement from regions of disagreement . hence the minimal",

    "none of these branches may intersect somewhere else , by property ( i ) . by the translation - invariance of @xmath122",

    "the energy @xmath141 of @xmath140 is defined to be @xmath142 with @xmath143 taken from @xmath19 or equivalently @xmath33 .",
    "it must be that @xmath144 with probability one for the following reasons , which we sketch here and make precise later in the proof of proposition 2 .",
    "suppose that a rung could be found with negative energy ( there is zero probability of a zero - energy rung ) ; by translation - invariance there would need to be many such rungs between some fixed pair of adjacent domain walls .",
    "consider the `` rectangle '' formed by two such negative - energy rungs and the connecting segments of the two adjacent domain walls .",
    "the sum of @xmath145 along the couplings in the domain wall segments would be positive in one gsp ( say , @xmath19 ) , and would therefore be negative in the other ( say , @xmath33 ) . therefore , the loop formed by the boundary of this rectangle would violate eq .",
    "( [ eq : loop ] ) in gsp @xmath33 .",
    "it is then natural to ask the deeper question of whether rung energies along any strip are strictly bounded away from zero , or whether their infimum is exactly zero .",
    "propositions  2 and 3 address this question .",
    "* proposition 2 . *",
    "the rung energies @xmath146 between two fixed ( adjacent ) domain walls can not be arbitrarily small ; i.e. , there is zero probability that @xmath147 .",
    "* proposition 3 .",
    "* there is zero probability that @xmath148 .",
    "the contradiction between propositions 2 and 3 leads directly to theorem  1 .",
    "these propositions will be proved in section  [ sec : proofof23 ] .",
    "in this section , we present two auxiliary propositions .",
    "they will be used in the next section to prove propositions 2 and  3 .",
    "these auxiliary propositions involve two notions , transition value and flexibility , that arise in the analysis of how a gsp changes when a _",
    "coupling , @xmath72 , varies . since this is a restricted case of the dependence of @xmath95}$ ] on a finite collection @xmath71 of couplings , we begin the section by providing a more detailed exposition of the excitation metastate than that given in sect .  3 above .",
    "along with an empirical distribution construction of the excitation metastate @xmath92 as a probability measure , defined for @xmath12-almost every @xmath41 , on configurations @xmath149 of excitation energies and states for the given @xmath41 , there is an alternative aw - type construction , as follows . for each @xmath17 , consider @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 denote the excitation energies and states in @xmath16 , with periodic boundary conditions , when the spin configuration on @xmath64 is constrained to be @xmath66 ( for all allowed @xmath62 s and @xmath63 s ) . as in the aw ground",
    "metastate construction , one has sequential compactness of the corresponding probability measures , @xmath153 , leading to convergence of the finite dimensional distributions ( involving finitely many couplings , finitely many finite @xmath62 s and finitely many @xmath63 s ) to those of a limiting translation - invariant measure @xmath154 on infinite - volume configurations @xmath155 along deterministic subsequences of @xmath17 s .",
    "the marginal distribution of @xmath41 from this @xmath154 is of course just @xmath12 and the conditional distribution of @xmath93 given @xmath41 is then an excitation metastate @xmath156 , which , like in the ground metastate case , can be shown for @xmath12-almost every @xmath41 to equal the @xmath92 constructed via empirical distributions , as the limit along a subsubsequence of @xmath157 the translation - invariance of @xmath154 follows , as usual , from the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the relative compactness ( tightness ) for @xmath158 follows from the two - valuedness of spin variables .",
    "finally , the relative compactness ( tightness ) for @xmath159 follows from the trivial bound , @xmath160 denotes the sum over bonds @xmath9 with either @xmath50 or @xmath43 or both in @xmath62 , together with the fact that the distribution of the @xmath11 s does not change with @xmath17 .    as explained in sect .  3 , for a given @xmath41 , we can extract from @xmath93 not only the gsp @xmath19 , but also @xmath95}$ ] , which describes how the gsp changes when the couplings in a fixed finite set @xmath69 of bonds vary .",
    "when @xmath69 consists of a single bond @xmath161 , we write @xmath162 for the ground state that results when @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath163 with all other couplings of @xmath41 left unchanged .",
    "it should be clear from equations ( [ eq : partengyiv ] ) and ( [ eq : gdstdepiv ] ) that as @xmath163 varies in @xmath164 , the gsp @xmath162 changes exactly once ( this is particularly easy to see in finite volume and the property is preserved in the excitation metastate ) , from its original configuration @xmath19 when @xmath165 to a new configuration @xmath166 where @xmath167 is one of the two spin configurations on @xmath168 of opposite parity to the original gsp @xmath19 ( so that @xmath169 is @xmath170 in one of @xmath19 and @xmath171 and @xmath172 in the other , or equivalently @xmath72 is satisfied in one and unsatisfied in the other ) .",
    "we call the value of @xmath163 where this change happens the transition value and denote it by @xmath173 .    for",
    "a given @xmath174 , the transition value @xmath173 and the _ unordered _ set of two gsp s @xmath175 do _ not _ depend on the value of @xmath72 , with all other couplings held fixed ( again , this is clear for finite volume , and is preserved in the limit ) .",
    "this means that with respect to the probability measure @xmath154 on infinite - volume configurations @xmath155 , _ the random variables @xmath173 and @xmath72 are independent_. the next proposition is an immediate consequence of this independence .",
    "* proposition 4 . * with probability one ,",
    "no coupling @xmath72 is exactly at its transition value @xmath173 .",
    "* proof of proposition 4 .",
    "* from the independence of @xmath72 and @xmath173 , and the continuity of the distribution of @xmath72 , it follows that there is probability zero that @xmath176 .",
    "as in the proof of the last proposition , we continue to work on the probability space of @xmath155 configurations with probability measure @xmath154 .",
    "when the value of @xmath72 is moved from its original value past the transition value @xmath173 , the change from the original ground state of @xmath19 to the new ground state , and originally excited state , of @xmath171 may involve the flipping of a finite droplet ( region of @xmath1 ) or one or more infinite droplets . thus the symmetric difference @xmath177 , representing the dual bonds which change from satisfied to unsatisfied or vice - versa , may consist of a single finite loop or else of one or more infinite disconnected paths , but in all cases some part must pass through @xmath174 since its satisfaction status clearly changes . to help analyze what other bonds @xmath177 may or may not pass through , we introduce the notion of flexibility .",
    "the flexibility of a bond @xmath178 is defined as @xmath179 and thus is proportional to the excitation energy needed to flip the relative sign of the spins at @xmath50 and @xmath43 ; it is a measure of the stability of the ground state @xmath19 with respect to fluctuations of the single coupling @xmath72 .",
    "* proposition 5 .",
    "* for two bonds @xmath180 and @xmath174 , there is zero probability that @xmath181 and simultaneously @xmath182 passes through @xmath174 .",
    "* proof of proposition 5 . * for finite @xmath17 , and a bond @xmath183 in @xmath16 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath184 the finite - volume flexibility .",
    "now @xmath185 is clearly the minimum , over all droplets in @xmath16 , with periodic boundary conditions , whose boundary passes through @xmath183 , of ( half the ) droplet flip energy cost in the gsp @xmath186 . since this is the case for both @xmath187 and @xmath188 , it is an immediate consequence that the finite - volume droplet boundary @xmath189 can not pass through @xmath174 if @xmath190 .",
    "after @xmath87 , the characterization of @xmath191 as a minimum over finite droplets may be lost , but we claim that the conclusion of the proposition still holds .",
    "this is because , although the convergence of @xmath153 along a subsequence to @xmath154 is not sufficient to imply , e.g. , that the probability of @xmath190 converges along the subsequence to the limiting probability of @xmath181 , it is sufficent to imply that the probability of the event in the proposition is less than or equal to the the lim  inf of the ( zero ) probability of the corresponding finite - volume events .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .",
    "* proof of proposition 2 . *",
    "suppose that there are two adjacent domain walls from the gsp s @xmath19 and @xmath33 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , with @xmath192 passing through the origin of the dual lattice , and suppose further that the infimum @xmath39 of rung energies @xmath146 for rungs @xmath194 between @xmath192 and @xmath193 is zero .",
    "our object is to prove that this event has zero probability .",
    "if the probability is nonzero , then for every @xmath195 there is some @xmath196 so that , with nonzero probability , there is a rung @xmath194 between @xmath192 and @xmath193 , with the property @xmath197 , that its length , defined as the number of bonds , is below @xmath198 and its energy @xmath146 is below @xmath199 .",
    "but then , by translation - invariance and the lemma given right after this proof , there must , with nonzero probability , be infinitely many such rungs with property @xmath197 with starting points on @xmath192 in _ both _ directions from the origin along @xmath192 .",
    "thus we can find two such rungs @xmath140 and @xmath194 , one in each direction , and sufficiently far apart that they do not touch each other .",
    "consider the `` rectangular '' region of @xmath1 whose boundary is the union of these two rungs and the connecting segments , @xmath200 and @xmath201 of @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the energy cost of flipping the spins in this region in @xmath19 ( respectively , in @xmath33 ) is @xmath202 ( respectively , @xmath203 ) .",
    "both these quantities must be positive since both @xmath19 and @xmath33 are gsp s ; hence @xmath204 is bounded by @xmath205 and the energy costs in both ground states are bounded by @xmath206 .",
    "this implies that every bond @xmath174 that @xmath192 ( or @xmath193 ) passes through has flexibility less than @xmath207 .",
    "since @xmath199 is arbitrary , the flexibilities must be zero , but that would contradict proposition  4 .",
    "this , together with the following lemma , completes the proof .",
    "* lemma 1 .",
    "* suppose @xmath208 is a translation - invariant property of rungs , e.g. , the property that the rung energy is below a certain value and/or the rung length is below a certain value .",
    "there is zero probability that there exist two adjacent domain walls , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , such that the set of starting points on @xmath192 of rungs between @xmath192 and @xmath193 that satisfy @xmath208 is nonempty without being doubly infinite , i.e. , along _ both _ directions of @xmath192 .",
    "* proof of lemma 1 . *",
    "the proof is based entirely on the translation invariance of the measure @xmath154 .",
    "suppose the claim of the lemma is false .",
    "then for each site @xmath50 in the dual lattice , there is nonzero probability for the event @xmath209 that there is a domain wall @xmath210 passing through @xmath50 and an adjacent wall @xmath211 such that @xmath50 is the _",
    "last _ site in one of the two directions along @xmath210 such that there is a rung from that site to @xmath211 satisfying @xmath208 .",
    "since every domain wall has two directions and at most two adjacent domain walls , _ there can be at most four sites on any domain wall for which this event occurs_. every domain wall that intersects the square @xmath16 , sitting inside the infinite lattice , much touch the boundary of the square and thus there are at most @xmath212 such domain walls for some constant @xmath213 , and consequently at most @xmath214 sites @xmath50 in @xmath16 for which @xmath209 occurs .",
    "but by the ergodic theorem for spatial translations , there is nonzero probability that the number of such sites exceeds @xmath215 for some constant @xmath216 .",
    "this contradiction completes the proof .      for the proof ,",
    "we need the notion of a `` super - satisfied '' bond @xmath217 .",
    "it is easy to see , for a given @xmath41 , that @xmath174 is satisfied in every ground state if @xmath218min@xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the sum of the three other coupling magnitudes @xmath221 touching @xmath50 , and @xmath222 is defined similarly .",
    "such a bond or its dual , called super - satisfied , clearly can not be part of a domain wall between any two gsp s .    as in the proof of proposition  1 , but using the excitation metastates @xmath92 and @xmath223 that extend the ground metastates from which @xmath19 and @xmath33 are chosen , we work in the probability space with the coupled measure @xmath224 . on this space , we can consider the modified ground states @xmath95}$ ] and @xmath225}$ ] as any finitely many couplings are varied as well as the transition values and flexibilities for both @xmath19 and @xmath33 for all bonds @xmath174 .",
    "now suppose that the rung energy infimum @xmath39 between some pair @xmath226 of domain walls satisfies @xmath148 with positive probability ; we show this leads to a contradiction .",
    "first we find , as in fig .  1",
    ", a rung @xmath140 and two dual bonds @xmath227 whose locations on @xmath192 are respectively in opposite directions from the starting site of @xmath140 , and such that @xmath228 , which we denote by @xmath229 , is strictly less than the flexibility values for both @xmath19 and @xmath33 of both @xmath227 . the existence with positive probability of such an @xmath140 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 follows from the non - vanishing of flexibilities given by proposition  4 and translation - invariance ( e.g. , lemma  1 ) .",
    "but we also want a situation , as in fig .  1 , where all the dual lattice non - domain - wall bonds that touch @xmath192 between @xmath230 and @xmath231 , other than the first bond @xmath180 in @xmath140 , are super - satisfied , and remain so regardless of changes of @xmath232 ( by a bounded amount )",
    ". we will call these bonds , numbering ten in fig .  1 , the `` special '' bonds .",
    "how do we know that such a situation will occur with nonzero probability ? if necessary , we can first adjust the signs and then increase the magnitudes ( in an appropriate order ) of the couplings of the special bonds , so that they first become satisfied and then super - satisfied .",
    "this can be done in an `` allowed '' way because of our assumption that the distribution of individual couplings has unbounded support .",
    "also , this can be done so that @xmath233}$ ] and @xmath234}$ ] remain unchanged from @xmath19 or @xmath33 , and without changing @xmath141 , without decreasing any other @xmath146 ( and thus without changing @xmath39 or @xmath235 ) and without decreasing the flexibilities of @xmath230 or @xmath231 .",
    "starting from a nonzero probability event , such an allowed change of finitely many couplings in @xmath6 yields an event which still has nonzero probability .",
    "next , suppose we move @xmath232 toward its transition value @xmath236 by an amount slightly greater than @xmath229 .",
    "the geometry  see , e.g. , fig .  1  and proposition  5",
    "forbid the replacement of either @xmath19 or @xmath33 by @xmath237 or @xmath238 , because it is impossible , under the conditions given , for @xmath182 or @xmath239 to connect to the end of bond @xmath180 touching @xmath192 .",
    "but this change of @xmath232 reduces @xmath141 below @xmath146 for any @xmath194 not containing @xmath180 , yielding a nonzero probability event that contradicts translation - invariance ( i.e. , lemma  1 ) .",
