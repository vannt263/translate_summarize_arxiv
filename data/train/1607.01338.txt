    "we end the paper by discussing some open problems . moreover , we present some final comments and remarks to supplement our work .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , nonlinear evolution processes give birth to a wide variety of phenomena .",
    "indeed we have seen that solutions of problem exhibit a travelling wave behaviour for large times when @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 , while infinite speed of propagation when @xmath29 .",
    "it is natural to ask ourselves what happens in the range of parameters @xmath764 that we call `` very fast diffusion assumption '' .",
    "however , respect to the porous medium and the @xmath6-laplacian case , we have to face the problem of lack of literature and previous works related to the doubly nonlinear operator ( in this range of parameters ) .",
    "for this reason , in the next paragraphs we will briefly discuss what is known for the porous medium and the @xmath6-laplacian case , trying to guess what could happen in the presence of the doubly nonlinear operator .",
    "we stress that our approach is quite _ formal _ , but can be interesting since it gives a more complete vision of the fast diffusion range , and allows us to explain what are ( or could be ) the main differences respect to the range @xmath29 .",
    "this critical case was firstly studied by king @xcite and later in @xcite for the porous medium setting , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath766 , with @xmath767 .",
    "when @xmath768 it follows @xmath769 , choice of parameter which goes out of our range and we avoid it .",
    "king studied the asymptotic behaviour of radial solutions of the pure diffusive equation @xmath770 with @xmath13 , @xmath771 , and @xmath767 .",
    "actually , he considered a slightly different equation absorbing a factor @xmath153 in the time varible and he studied the cases @xmath18 and @xmath772 , too .",
    "note that the choice @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath773 when @xmath62 .",
    "in @xcite , the author described the asymptotic behaviour of radial solutions of equation , given by the formula @xmath774 where @xmath775 is a constant depending on @xmath271 and on the initial datum ( see formula ( 2.34 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it follows that the solutions of have spacial power like decay @xmath776 `` corrected '' by a logarithmic term for @xmath156 .",
    "we are interested in seeing that an analogue decay holds when @xmath5 and @xmath67 in the doubly nonlinear setting .",
    "we proceed as in @xcite , see section 2 .",

    "_ let s take for a moment @xmath29 .",

    "note that it corresponds to fix @xmath661 and take the limit as @xmath172 in the formula of the barenblatt solutions , see subsection [ preliminariesintro ] .",
    "now , motivated by the previous analysis , we fix @xmath779 ( in order to remain in the ranges @xmath780 and @xmath5 ) , @xmath67 , and we look for solutions of equation in the form @xmath781 for some correction function @xmath782 as @xmath172 and some constant @xmath109 . in what follows",

    "hence , it is simple to see that @xmath566 solves if and only if @xmath786 now , it is clear that a possible choice is @xmath787 , for some @xmath552 , and a straightforward computation shows that the previous equation is satisfied by taking @xmath788 so that for all @xmath661 , we obtain @xmath789 which generalizes the case @xmath13 and @xmath773 .",

    "in particular , they are eternal , i.e. defined for all @xmath793 and they do not converge to a dirac delta as @xmath741 ( see also @xcite ) . finally , for all fixed @xmath793 , these self - similar solutions are _ not integrable _ respect with to the spacial variable and show the spacial decay @xmath794 taking into account these facts , when @xmath67 it seems reasonable to study problem with nontrivial initial datum satisfying @xmath795 for some constant @xmath149 , and trying to extend the techniques used for the range @xmath29 , to the this critical case .",
    "first of all , we can define @xmath796 by continuity .",
    "thus , it is possible to repeat the proof of theorem [ convergencetozerofastdiffusion ] by using `` pseudo - barenblatt '' solutions instead of the usual ones . in this way , for all @xmath32",
    ", we show the convergence of the solutions to 0 in the `` outer sets '' @xmath34 , as @xmath191 .",
    "however , it is clear that the methods employed for showing proposition [ expanpansionofminimallevelsets ] can not be used in this case too .",
    "indeed , in the range @xmath29 , this crucial proposition has been proved by constructing barriers from below with barenblatt solutions .",
    "this has been possible since the initial datum @xmath387 in shares the same spacial decay of these self - similar solutions . in the critical case",
    "@xmath67 , this property would not be preserved as suggests . in particular , `` pseudo - barenblatt '' solutionscannot be placed under an initial datum satisfying and so the validity of proposition [ expanpansionofminimallevelsets ] in this critical case remains an open problem .      before discussing the doubly nonlinear diffusion , let us recall what is known in the porous medium setting in the corresponding range of parameters , @xmath802 , @xmath62 , and @xmath767 . consider the porous medium equation @xmath803 where @xmath804 .",
    "it has been proved that the corresponding solution @xmath222 extinguishes in finite time ( see for instance @xcite and the references therein ) . in other words , there exists a critical `` extinction time '' @xmath805 such that @xmath806 , for all @xmath807 .",
    "again , the cases @xmath769 , @xmath72 and @xmath769 , @xmath808 are critical and we refer to @xcite , chapters 5 to 8 .    _ barenblatt solutions for @xmath68",
    "_ so , even though there is not literature on the subject ( at least to our knowledge ) , it seems reasonable to conjecture that the doubly nonlinear diffusion shows a similar property in the range @xmath68 , with @xmath779 . in particular , also in this case we have `` pseudo - barenblatt '' solutions written in the form @xmath809^{-\\frac{p-1}{\\widehat{\\gamma}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath810 and , with a strong departure from , @xmath811^{-\\frac{|\\alpha|}{n}},\\ ] ] where @xmath812 is fixed and stands for the `` extinction time''(cfr . with @xcite pag . 194 or @xcite for the case @xmath62 , and with formula for the range @xmath29 ) .",
