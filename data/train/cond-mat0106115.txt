    "the cubic complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) is one of the most - studied nonlinear equations in the physics community .",
    "it describes on a qualitative , and often even on a quantitative level a vast variety of phenomena from nonlinear waves to second - order phase transitions , from superconductivity , superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation to liquid crystals and strings in field theory ( kuramoto , 1984 , cross and hohenberg , 1993 , newell _ et al _ , 1993 , pismen , 1999 , bohr _",
    "et al _ , 1998 , dangelmayr and kramer , 1998 ) .",
    "our goal is to give an overview of various phenomena described by the cgle from the point of view of condensed matter physicists .",
    "our approach is to study the relevant solutions to get insight into nonequilibrium phenomena in spatially extended systems .",
    "more elementary and detailed introductions into the concepts underlying the equation can be found in manneville ( 1990 ) , van saarloos ( 1993 ) , van hecke _",
    "et al _ ( 1994 ) , nicolis ( 1995 ) and walgraaf ( 1997 ) .",
    "the equation is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex function of ( scaled ) time @xmath2 and space @xmath3 ( often in reduced dimension @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) and the real parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 characterize linear and nonlinear dispersion .",
    "the equation arises in physics in particular as a `` modulational '' ( or `` envelope '' or `` amplitude '' ) equation .",
    "it provides a reduced , universal description of `` weakly nonlinear '' spatio - temporal phenomena in extended ( in @xmath3 ) continuous media whose linear dispersion is of a very general type ( see below ) and which are invariant under a global change of gauge ( multiplication of @xmath1 by @xmath8 ) .",
    "this symmetry typically arises when @xmath1 is the ( slowly varying ) amplitude of a phenomenon that is periodic in at least one variable ( space and/or time ) as a consequence of translational invariance of the system .",
    "the assumptions of slow variation and weak nonlinearity are valid in particular near the instability of a homogeneous ( in @xmath3 ) basic state and eq .",
    "( [ cgle ] ) can be viewed as a ( generalized ) normal form of the resulting `` primary '' bifurcation .",
    "then , in analogy with phase transitions , @xmath1 is often called an order parameter .    to see more clearly the analogy with the order parameter concept we write the equation in the unscaled form , as derived for example from the underlying set of basic ( e.g. hydrodynamic ) equations for a definite physical situation @xmath9 equation ( [ cgle ] )",
    "is obtained from ( [ agle ] ) by the transformations @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the case @xmath13 and @xmath14 was assumed .",
    "otherwise the signs in front of the first and/or last term on the right - hand side of ( [ cgle ] ) have to be reversed .",
    "the physical quantities @xmath15 ( temperature , velocities , densities , electric field etc . ) are given in the form @xmath16 ( c.c.@xmath17 complex conjugate , h.o.t.@xmath17 higher - order terms ) .",
    "if the phenomena occur in ( thin ) layers , on surfaces , or in ( narrow ) channels , then @xmath18 , derived from the linear problem , describes the spatial dependence of the physical quantities in the transverse @xmath19 direction(s ) .",
    "@xmath18 is a linear eigenvector and @xmath20 the corresponding eigenvalues . in the case of periodically driven systems",
    ", @xmath18 would include a periodic time dependence .    in order to identify the character of the various terms in the linear part of ( [ agle ] ) one",
    "may also consider the dispersion relation obtained from ( [ agle ] ) and ( [ physical ] ) for small harmonic perturbations of the basic state @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the wavevector in the physical system and @xmath24 is the complex growth rate of the perturbation .",
    "@xmath25 is a characteristic time , @xmath26 is the coherence length , @xmath27 a linear group velocity , and @xmath28 a correction to the hopf frequency @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 measures in a dimensionless scale the distance from threshold of the instability , i.e. @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the control parameter that carries the system through the threshold at @xmath33 . note that there is an arbitrary overall factor in eqs .",
    "( [ agle ] ) and ( [ dispersion1 ] ) which is fixed by the ultimately arbitrary choice of the definition of @xmath30 . the value of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ agle ] ) depends on the choice of the normalization of the linear eigenvector @xmath18 .",
    "now we can proceed to summarize the conditions for validity of the cgle .",
    "the following four points are to some extent interrelated .",
    "\\a ) correct choice of order parameter space ,",
    "i.e. a single complex scalar : first of all this necessitates that @xmath29 and/or @xmath35 are nonzero , because otherwise one would expect a real order parameter as in simple phase transitions .",
    "an exception is the transition to superconductivity and superfluidity where the order parameter is complex for quantum mechanical reasons ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath36 , one may run into problems with conservation laws which frequently exclude a homogeneous change of the system . in this case of long - wavelength instabilities often",
    "somewhat different order - parameter equations arise ( see e.g. nepomnyashchii , 1995a ) .",
    "secondly , a discrete degeneracy ( or near degeneracy ) of neutral modes is excluded , which may arise by symmetry ( see below for an example ) or by accident .",
    "if the eigenvectors of the different modes are different one would need several order parameters and a set of coupled equations .",
    "if the eigenvectors coincide ( or nearly coincide ) , which may happen at ( or near ) a co - dimension-2 point , one can again use one equation , which would now contain higher space or time derivatives .",
    "\\b ) validity of the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion1 ] ) : since there is no real contribution linear in @xmath37 and since @xmath38 is a positive quantity the real growth rate @xmath39 has a minimum at @xmath40 . in more than 1d",
    "this excludes an important class of systems , namely isotropic ones with @xmath41 like rayleigh - bnard convection in simple 2d fluid layers .",
    "there one has a continuous degeneracy of neutral linear modes .",
    "the neglect of terms of higher order in @xmath30 and in @xmath37 is usually justified near the bifurcation .",
    "\\c ) symmetries : translation invariance in @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "actually the cgle incorporates translational invariance with respect to space and/or time on two levels .",
    "one is expressed by the global gauge invariance , which in the cgle can be absorbed in a shift of @xmath3 and/or time @xmath2 .",
    "note that this invariance excludes terms that are quadratic in @xmath1 .",
    "the other is expressed by the autonomy of the cgle ( no explicit dependence on space and time ) .",
    "the two invariances reflect the fact that the fast and the slow space and time scales are not coupled in this description .",
    "this is an approximation which can not be overcome by going to higher order in the expansion in terms of amplitude and gradients .",
    "the coupling effects are in fact nonanalytic in @xmath30 ( `` non - adiabatic effects '' , see , e.g. pomeau ( 1984 ) , kramer and zimmermann ( 1985 ) , bensimon _ et al _ ( 1988 ) ) .",
    "\\d ) validity of the ( lowest - order ) weakly nonlinear approximation : we will deal mostly with the case of a supercritical ( `` forward '' , or `` normal '' ) bifurcation where @xmath14 and then higher - order nonlinearities in eq .",
    "( [ cgl ] ) can be neglected sufficiently near threshold . if the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ cgl ] ) has the opposite sign , which corresponds to a subcritical ( `` backward '' or `` inverse '' ) bifurcation , higher - order nonlinear terms are usually essential .",
    "however , even in this case , there exist for sufficiently large values of @xmath42 relevant solutions that bifurcate supercritically , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ smampsol ] .    from the linear theory",
    "we can now distinguish three classes of primary bifurcations where eq .",
    "( [ cgle ] ) arises :    \\i ) @xmath43 : for such _ stationary periodic _",
    "instabilities @xmath44 is real , and in fact all the imaginary coefficients ( including the group velocity @xmath45 ) vanish .",
    "generically , reflection symmetry is needed ( see below ) .",
    "equation ( [ cgle ] ) then reduces to the `` real '' ginzburg - landau equation ( gle ) @xmath46 which one might also call the `` complex nonlinear diffusion equation '' in some analogy with the nonlinear schroedinger equation ( see below ) .",
    "examples that display such an instability are rayleigh - bnard convection in simple and complex fluids , taylor - couette flow , electroconvection in liquid crystals and many others . in more than 1d there is the restriction mentioned under b ) .",
    "thus in isotropic 2d systems the dispersion relation is changed and the laplacian in eq.([gle ] ) has to be substituted by a different differential operator .",
    "the corresponding equation derived by newell and whitehead ( 1969 ) and by segel ( 1969 ) was in fact the first amplitude equation that included spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "it is applicable only for situations with nearly parallel rolls , which is in isotropic systems an important restriction .",
    "so in more than one dimension the system must be anisotropic , which is the case in particular for convective instabilities in liquid crystals ( kramer and pesch , 1995 ) , but holds also for rayleigh - bnard convection in an inclined layer ( daniels _ et al _ , 2000 ) or in a conducting fluid in the presence of a magnetic field with an axial component ( eltayeb , 1971 ) .",
    "also the taylor - couette instability in the small gap limit can be viewed as an anisotropic quasi-2d system . in 2d eq .",
    "( [ gle ] ) was first considered in the context of electrohydrodynamic convection in a planarly aligned nematic liquid crystal layer ( pesch and kramer , 1986 , bodenschatz _ et al _ , 1988a ,",
    "kramer and pesch , 1995 , for review see also buka and kramer , 1996 ) the laplacian in eq .",
    "( [ agle ] ) is obtained after a linear coordinate transformation .",
    "\\ii ) @xmath47 : the prime example for such _ oscillatory uniform _ instabilities are oscillatory chemical reactions ( see e.g. de wit , 1999 ) . in lasers ( or passive nonlinear optical systems ) this type may also arise ( newell and moloney , 1992 ) . in hydrodynamic systems such instabilities are often suppressed by mass conservation ( see , however , brzsnyi _ et al _ , 2000 ) .",
    "isotropy does not cause any problems here and the laplacian applies directly . in the presence of reflection symmetry the group velocity term in eq .",
    "( [ agle ] ) is absent .",
    "the spatial patterns obtained from @xmath1 reflect directly those of the physical system .",
    "the imaginary parts proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 pertain to linear and nonlinear frequency change ( renormalization ) of the oscillations , respectively . in most systems",
    "the nonlinear frequency change is negative ( frequency decreases with amplitude ) , so that @xmath48 with our choice of signs .",
    "coefficients for the cgle have been determined e.g. from experiments on the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction ( hynne _ et al _ , 1993 , kramer _",
    "et al _ , 1994 ) .",
    "\\iii ) @xmath49 : this _ oscillatory periodic _",
    "instability occurs in hydrodynamic and optical systems .",
    "the best - studied example is rayleigh - bnard convection in binary mixtures , although here the bifurcation is in the accessible parameter range mostly subcritical ( schpf and zimmermann , 1990 , lcke _ et al _ , 1992 ) . also , in 2d , the system is isotropic , so that the simple cgle ( [ agle ] ) is not applicable .",
    "other 1d examples are the oscillatory instability in rayleigh - bnard convection in low prandtl number fluids , which in 2d occurs as a secondary instability of stationary rolls . in a 1d geometry with just one longitudinal roll",
    "it can be treated as a primary bifurcation ( janiaud _ et al _ , 1992 ) .",
    "other examples include the wall instability in rotating rayleigh - bnard convection ( tu and cross , 1992 , van hecke and van saarloos , 1997 , yuanming and ecke , 1999 ) and hydrothermal waves , where the coefficients of the cgle were determined from experiment ( burguette _ et al _ , 1999 ) . in 2d",
    "the prime example is the electrohydrodynamic instability in nematic liquid crystals in thin and clean cells ( otherwise one has the more common stationary rolls ) ( treiber and kramer , 1998 ) .",
    "actually in such an anisotropic 2d system one is lead to a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ cgle ] ) where the term @xmath50 is replaced by a more general bilinear form @xmath51 , see sec .",
    "[ subsec : aniso ] .",
    "most of the oscillatory periodic systems just mentioned have reflection symmetry and then one has to allow for the possibility of counter - propagating waves which makes a description in terms of two coupled cgles necessary ( see cross and hohenberg , 1993 ) .",
    "the degeneracy between left and right traveling waves can be lifted by breaking the reflection symmetry by applying additional fields or an additional flow .",
    "in this situation one roll system is favored over the other and , if the effect is strong enough , a single cgle can be used .",
    "breaking reflection symmetry in stationary periodic instabilities ( case i ) ) the rolls will generically start to travel and one indeed arrives at an oscillatory periodic instability ( case iii ) ) .",
    "this has been studied experimentally by applying a through flow in thermal convection ( pocheau and croquette , 1984 ) or in the taylor - couette system ( tsameret and steinberg , 1994 ; babcock , ahlers , and cannell , 1991 ) or by non - symmetric surface alignment in electroconvection of nematics ( pretilt or hybrid alignment , see e.g. krekhov and kramer , 1996 ) .    since the drift introduces a frequency , for sufficiently strongly broken reflection symmetry the distinction between cases i ) and iii )",
    "is lost , as is obvious in open - flow systems ( leweke and provansal , 1994 , 1995 ; roussopoulos and monkewitz , 1996 ) .",
    "the cgle may also be viewed as a dissipative extension of the conservative nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xmath52 which describes weakly nonlinear wave phenomena ( newell , 1974 ) .",
    "the prime examples are waves on deep water , ( dias and kharif , 1999 ) and nonlinear optics ( newell and moloney , 1992 ) . the conservative limit of eq .",
    "( [ cgle ] ) is obtained by letting in eq .",
    "( [ agle ] ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 remaining nonzero , so that @xmath55 , and rescaling space and the amplitude .",
    "four key concepts come together in the cgle philosophy :    * _ weak nonlinearity _ , which amounts to an expansion in terms of the order parameter @xmath56 .",
    "this concept goes back to landau s theory of second - order phase transitions ( landau , 1937a ) .",
    "landau also employed this type of expansion in his attempt to explain the transition to turbulence ( landau , 1944 ) . in the context of stationary ,",
    "pattern - forming , hydrodynamic instabilities the weakly nonlinear expansion leading to a solvability condition at third order was introduced by gorkov ( 1957 ) and malkus and veronis ( 1958 ) .",
    "one should also mention the work of abrikosov in 1957 ( for review see abrikosov ( 1988 ) ) where he presents the theory of the mixed state of type ii superconductors in a magnetic field based on the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity .",
    "the mixed state is a periodic array of flux lines ( or vortices ) corresponding to topological defects ( see below ) .",
    "abrikosov introduced a weakly nonlinear expansion to describe this state valid near the upper critical field . * _ slow relaxative time dependence _ was first used by landau in the above - mentioned paper on turbulence in 1944 . in the context of pattern - forming instabilities it goes back to stuart ( 1960 ) . *",
    "_ slow nonrelaxative time dependence _ with nonlinear frequency renormalization in the complex - amplitude formulation was introduced by stuart in 1960 using multi - scale analysis .",
    "of course perturbation theory for periodic orbits ( in particular conservative hamiltonian systems ) is a classical subject that was treated by bogoliubov , krylov and mitropolskii in 1937 ( for review , see bogoliubov and mitropolskii , 1961 ) . * _ slow spatial dependence _",
    "was included already by landau ( 1937b ) in the context of @xmath57-ray scattering by crystals in the neighborhood of the curie point .",
    "however , the concept became known with the success of the ( stationary ) phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity [ ginzburg and landau ( 1950 ) ] .",
    "the stationary gl theory for superconductivity has a particular resemblance to the modulational theories of pattern - forming systems because the order parameter is complex , although for a very different reason .",
    "superconductivity being a macroscopic quantum state requires an order parameter that has the symmetries of a wave function . in spite of the different origin",
    "one has many analogies .",
    "however , in superconductors the time dependence is rendered nonvariational primarily through the coupling to the electric field due to local gauge invariance ( see , e.g. abrikosov , 1988 ) , a mechanism that has no analog in pattern - forming systems .",
    "the time - dependent gl theory for superconductors was presented ( phenomenologically ) only in 1968 by schmid , ( derived from microscopic theory shortly afterwards by gorkov and eliashberg ( 1968 ) ) , when the first modulational theory was derived in the context of rayleigh - bnard convection by newell and whitehead ( 1969 ) and segel ( 1969 ) .",
    "( [ gle ] ) with additional noise term has been studied intensively as a model of phase transitions in equilibrium systems , see e.g. hohenberg and halperin ( 1977 ) .",
    "the full cgle was introduced phenomenologically by newell and whitehead ( 1971 ) .",
    "it was derived by stewartson and stuart ( 1971 ) and diprima , eckhaus and segel ( 1971 ) in the context of the destabilization of plane shear flow , where its applicability is limited by the fact that one deals with a strongly subcritical bifurcation . in the context of chemical systems",
    "the cgle was introduced by kuramoto and tsuzuki ( 1974 ) .",
    "there exists an extended mathematical literature on the cgle , which we will touch rather little , see e.g. doering _ et al _ ( 1987 , 1988 ) , levermore and stark ( 1997 ) , doelman ( 1995 ) , van harten ( 1991 ) , milke and schneider ( 1996 ) , schneider ( 1994 ) , melbourne ( 1998 ) , milke ( 1998 ) .",
    "clearly the cgle ( [ cgle ] ) may be viewed as a very general normal - form type equation for a large class of bifurcations and nonlinear wave phenomena in spatially extended systems , so a detailed investigation of its properties is well justified .",
    "the equation `` interpolates '' between the two opposing limits of the conservative nlse and the purely relaxative gle .",
    "the cgle world lies between these limits where new phenomena and scenarios arise , like sink and source solutions ( spirals in 2d and filaments in 3d ) , various core and wave instabilities , nonlinear convective versus absolute instability , screening of interaction and competition between sources , various types of spatio - temporal chaos and glassy states .",
    "in this section we will study general properties of eq .",
    "( [ cgle ] ) relevant in all dimensions .      for the case of @xmath58",
    "it is useful to transform into a  rotating ",
    "frame @xmath59 .",

    "( [ rgle1 ] ) can be obtained by variation of the functional @xmath61 leading to @xmath62 and @xmath63 one sees that for all non - infinite @xmath6 the value of @xmath64 decreases , so the functional ( [ potential2 ] ) plays the role of a global lyapunov functional or generalized free energy ( @xmath64 is bounded from below ) .",
    "the system then relaxes towards local minima of the functional .",
    "in particular the stationary solutions @xmath65 of the gle ( b=0 ) correspond in the more general case to @xmath66 with corresponding stability properties .    in the nlse limit",
    "@xmath67 the functional becomes a hamiltonian , which is conserved .",
    "more generally , the nlse is obtained from the cgle by taking the limit @xmath68 without further restrictions .",
    "after rescaling one obtains eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) .",
    "one sees that the equation comes in two variants , the focusing ( @xmath69 sign ) and defocusing ( @xmath70sign ) case ( the notation comes from nonlinear optics . in 1d",
    "it is completely integrable ( zakharov and shabat , 1971 ) . in the focusing case",
    "it has a two - parameter family of `` bright '' solitons ( irrespective of space translations and gauge transformation ) . in d@xmath71 solutions",
    "typically exhibit finite - time singularities ( collapse ) ( zakharov , 1984 , for recent review see robinson , 1997 ) . in the defocusing case one",
    "has in 1d a three - parameter family of `` dark solitons '' that connect asymptotically to plane waves and vortices in 2 and 3d .",
    "we will here not discuss the equation since there exists a vast literature on it ( see e.g. proceedings of conference on the nonlinear schrdinger equation,1994 ) .",
    "it is useful to treat the cgle in the limit of large @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the point of view of a perturbed nlse .",

    "[ corins ] .",
    "although these features were obtained in the stable range @xmath503 ( @xmath504 ) , the external forces created by the inhomogeneity can excite the weakly damped core mode .",

    "spiral motion in a slowly varying ( on the scale of the coherence length ) inhomogeneity was considered by hedrey _",

    "a related problem is the motion of the spiral in the presence of small thermal noise . as was shown by aranson _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) , the spiral core has finite mobility and performs brownian motion .",
    "symmetric bound states of spirals are not necessary stable .",
    "there is numerical evidence that symmetric bound states , after a sufficiently long evolution , spontaneously break the symmetry such that one spiral begins to dominate , pushing away other spirals  ( lega , 1990 ; weber _ et al _ ,",
    "1991a , b ; aranson _ et al _ , 1993b ) .",
    "symmetry - broken states are often produced directly from random initial conditions ( aranson _ et al _ , 1993b ) .",
    "to understand the symmetry - breaking instability one must consider the perturbation of the relative phase , or the frequency @xmath84 of the waves emitted by each spiral , caused by the interaction with the other spiral .",
    "indeed , from the analysis of cgle it is known , that the shock ( or sink ) where two waves with different frequencies @xmath505 collide moves in the direction of smaller frequency , due to conservation of phase .",
    "this means that after sufficiently long time only the larger frequency ( or equivalently the larger wavenumber @xmath171 , because of the dispersion relation @xmath506 ) dominates in a bounded system .",
    "the velocity of the motion is given by @xmath507 where @xmath508 is the group velocity of a plane - wave state .",
    "if due to the interaction the frequencies of the spirals become different , one can expect a drastic breaking of the symmetry of the system .",
    "this effect appears to be very important for the generic long - time evolution of large systems containing spirals ( vortex glass ) .",
    "the symmetry breaking instability of spiral pairs can be understood from the dynamics of the relative phase of the spirals @xmath509 .",
    "et al _ ( 1993b ) derived an equation governing the phase difference between two spirals separated by the distance @xmath510 @xmath511 where @xmath512 are the constants obtained from the linearized cgle .",
    "the last term represents the lowest - order term of an expansion in @xmath210 .",
    "the constant @xmath513 determined numerically from eq .",
    "( [ freq1 ] ) turns out to be positive for the ( first ) symmetric bound state ( see fig . [ fig7_b ] ) , so that the state is unstable with respect to @xmath210 .",
    "according to aranson _",
    "( 1993b ) , bound states are unstable with respect to symmetry breaking in the whole oscillatory range .",
    "due to the fact that @xmath513 is very small , the symmetric bound state is rather long lived . as a result of the symmetry breaking only one  free  spiral",
    "will remain , whereas the other spiral is pushed away to the boundary . depending on the boundary conditions the second spiral will finally either annihilate at the boundary ( non - flux boundary conditions , i.e. zero normal derivative on the boundary ) , or , with periodic boundary conditions the defect will persist for topological reasons , but reduced to a sink and enslaved in the corner of the shock structure of the free spiral ( edge vortex ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this leads to an asymmetric lattice of topological defects , which appears to be stable in the oscillatory case .",
    "the absence of symmetry breaking in the limit @xmath514 and @xmath515 can be extracted already from the paper of hagan ( 1982 ) . from this work",
    "one finds that decreasing the radius increases the spiral wavenumber , which ultimately means stability of the shocks .",
    "the stability of symmetric states together with the repulsion of the spirals indicates the possibility for the existence of symmetric ( `` antiferromagnetic '' ) lattices of spirals ( or `` wigner crystal '' ) , i.e. lattices made up of developed spirals with alternating topological charge .",

    "there is no guarantee that similar lattices are stable in arbitrary large systems . ]",
    "since for large separation @xmath57 the properties of like - charged spirals are analogous to those of oppositely - charged spirals , one expects the same mechanism of symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed for @xmath516 above the critical value such a breaking was observed in numerical simulations .",
    "certain aspects of the spiral pair dynamics were studied numerically by komineas _",
    "et al _ ( 2001 ) .",
    "it was shown that for @xmath517 ( symmetry breaking range ) the spirals interchange partners and form new pairs . for @xmath494 ( monotonic range )",
    "symmetric spiral states were found .",
    "a fascinating problem concerns the effect of the symmetry breaking on the long - time behavior of large systems that evolve from random initial conditions in the parameter range where one has the oscillatory interaction and spirals .",
    "numerical simulations , carried out by huber _ et al _ ( 1992 ) , chat and manneville ( 1996 ) , have shown a remarkable phenomenon : from an initially strongly turbulent state eventually spirals with a developed far field evolve .",
    "the spirals grow until the entire space is filled ( see figure [ fig_gr ] ) , each spiral occupying a certain domain .",
    "the domains have various sizes and typically have a four or five - sided near polygon structure .",
    "locally each domain boundary , represented by a shock , is nearly hyperbolic .",
    "the shocks often contain `` enslaved '' , or edge vortices .",
    "this state appears to persist indefinitely , although sometimes domain boundaries break and edge vortices annihilate .",
    "the state was called `` vortex glass '' by huber _",
    "et al _ ( 1992 ) .",
    "some aspects of relaxation to the vortex glass were considered by braun and feudel ( 1996 ) .",
    "the existence of the `` vortex glass '' is connected with the nonmonotonic dependence of the spiral frequency on the domain size .",
    "as one sees from figure [ fig_om ] the spiral frequency oscillates as the radius of the domain increases and approaches the asymptotic value for @xmath395 .",
    "( the computations were done for a radially symmetric domain , but we expect the result to be qualitatively correct for domains with arbitrary convex shape . ) as a result , one has sets of domain radii @xmath518 corresponding to the same frequency .",
    "neighboring domains can only coexist without ( further ) `` symmetry breaking '' if they correspond to the same spiral frequency .",
    "ultimately one can conceive of a network of fully synchronized domains of various shapes and sizes .",
    "these are likely the ingredients necessary to explains the variability of the domain sizes observed in the quasi - stationary vortex glass .",
    "the vortex glass is presumably the global attractor also in the full convectively stable oscillatory range .",
    "bohr _ et al _ ( 1996 ) , ( 1997 ) considered the shapes of spiral domains in the vortex glass .",
    "they found that they differ from voronoi polygons and obtained the form of the domain boundaries from the condition of phase continuity across the shocks .",
    "in particular , far away from the center of an unperturbed spiral , the phase is given by @xmath519 , where @xmath520 are the polar coordinates measured from the center of the spiral and @xmath521 is the phase constant of the spiral .",
    "if one assumes that the distance between two neighboring spirals is much larger than the wavelength @xmath522 , one obtains simply a hyperbola describing the shock shape : @xmath523 .",
    "this simple formula reproduces the structure of the spiral domains with high accuracy ( see figure [ fig3_bohr ] ) .      on a rough scale ,",
    "two types of turbulent behaviors can be identified in 2d : phase and defect turbulence .",
    "defect turbulence is characterized by persistent creation and annihilation of point defects . by contrast , in phase turbulence no defects occur . in the system with periodic boundary conditions the total phase gradient across the system ( the `` winding number '' )",
    "is conserved .",
    "the simulations of manneville and chat ( 1996 ) provide some evidence that phase turbulence breaks down in the infinite size , infinite time limit . however , it could be that the transition is characterized by a `` sharp '' bifurcation scenario similar to the situation in 1d ( see [ stc_1da ] ) .",
    "the most detailed survey of various regimes occurring in 2d is given by chat and manneville ( 1996 ) and manneville and chat ( 1996 ) . according to chat and manneville ( 1996 )",
    ", the transition from vortex glass to defect turbulence starting from random initial conditions occurs at the numerically determined line `` t '' , see fig .",
    "[ fig_stab ] .",
    "the transition occurs somewhat _ prior _ to the absolute instability limit given from the linear stability analysis of plane waves emitted by spirals .",
    "however , starting from carefully prepared initial conditions in the form of large spirals one can approach the absolute instability limit .    before the line `` t''one finds transient defect turbulence which finally exhibits spontaneous nucleation of spirals from the `` turbulent sea '' . at the line `` t ''",
    "the nucleation time presumably diverges .",
    "before the line `` t '' the entire space will finally be filled by `` large spirals '' separated by shocks , forming a vortex glass state .    as in 1d",
    ", persistent phase turbulence exists also in 2d between the benjamin - feir - newell line and the line `` l '' ( chat and manneville , 1996 ; manneville and chat , 1996 ) .",
    "the range is somewhat smaller than in 1d . beyond the line",
    "`` l '' defects are created spontaneously leading to defect chaos . actually , in 2d , phase turbulence is always metastable with respect to defect turbulence or vortex glass .",
    "spiral break - up was observed in experiments on chemical oscillatory media by ouyang and flesselles ( 1996 ) , zhou and ouyang ( 2000 ) , in simulations of cgle by chat and manneville ( 1996 ) and model reaction - diffusion systems by br and or - guil ( 1999 ) .",
    "the instability likely originates from the outer region of the spiral and thus is expected to occur beyond the line `` t '' . quenching a large spiral to this domain will usually trigger a breakup scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "a careful adiabatic procedure allows , in principle , to avoid breakup and to preserve one large spiral up to the ( linear ) _ absolute instability threshold_. ( in the presence of noise , the convective instability actually imposes a maximal noise - dependent radius @xmath524 . )",
    "not too far from the absolute instability limit one is left with a smaller spiral surrounded by strong chaos ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gr ] , left ) whose well - defined radius @xmath32 _ does not _",
    "depend on system size and/or distance to the boundaries but vanishes as one approaches the absolute instability threshold .    in the experiments and in some model systems , a spiral need",
    "not be introduced initially , as the chaotic phase is only metastable to the spontaneous nucleation of spirals whose radius grows up to @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic configuration on a long time scale is actually a quasi - frozen cellular state ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gr ] , right ) .",
    "the above concept of spiral break - up in large systems is in contrast to arguments by tobias and knobloch ( 1998 ) , who stated that the spiral wave breakup occurs in the regime of _ absolute _ eckhaus instability via `` a globally unstable wall - mode confined to the outer boundary '' whose front structure is at the origin of the stable `` laminar '' spirals immersed in a turbulent sea . whereas a stationary front",
    "can indeed be associated with the absolute stability limit ( see sec.[abs ] ) it can only give an upper limit to the existence of the convectively unstable state .    in the break - up scenario studied by zhou and ouyang ( 2000 ) spirals emitting modulated waves in the presence of stable meandering of the core were observed .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of spatial amplification of periodic perturbations due to core meandering in the regime of convective instability of the background waves ( brusch _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "although the saturated meandering does not occur in the framework of the cgle , a properly perturbed cgle may exhibit both , saturated meandering and convective instability , see aranson , hochheiser and moloney ( 1997 ) .",
    "defect turbulence is the most chaotic state in 2d .",
    "it is characterized by exponential decay of correlations , with short correlation lengths and times .",
    "the density of defects varies with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , it can be argued that , at least in the most studied region with @xmath128 of order one , the defects do not play the role of `` particle - like '' excitations in this case .",
    "indeed , the defects in the defect turbulence are very different from spiral waves since they do nt emit waves .",
    "they behave as passive objects and are merely advected by the surrounding chaotic fluctuations . according to chat and manneville ( 1996 ) `` amplitude turbulence ''",
    "is a more appropriate name for such spatio - temporally chaotic state .",
    "one may argue that the stationary distribution for the number of defects is described by @xmath525 $ ] where @xmath526 is the average number of defects .",
    "the formula follows in the limit @xmath527 from treating defect pairs as statistical independent entities ( gil _ et al _ , 1990 ) .",
    "note that this assumption is strictly valid only for large domains .",
    "otherwise the statistics is influenced by defects entering / leaving the subsystem .",
    "when these processes dominate the exponent acquires a factor @xmath528 .",
    "egolf ( 1998 ) extracted the degrees of freedom associated with defects from those of phase fluctuations by using the concept of finite - time lyapunov dimension .",
    "he found that each defect `` carries '' from one to two degrees of freedom .",
    "although one may argue that the number of defects can be a convenient characterization of some types of spatio - temporal chaos , the method of separation does not appear fully convincing because the relation between the finite - time dimension and number of defects is not examined for different system sizes and duration intervals .",
    "it is interesting to mention that a similar analysis performed by strain and greenside ( 1998 ) for a reaction diffusion system results in a much higher dimension per / defect , namely between 3 and 7 .",
    "mazenko ( 2001 ) studied defect statistics in the cgle in the `` defect - coarsening regime '' ( presumably the region of small @xmath6 and @xmath7 and mean distance between defects smaller than the screening length @xmath529 ) using an expression for the defect velocity similar to that of rica and tirapegui ( 1990),(1991a ) , which is not applicable for defects separated by more than the core size of o(1 ) .",
    "one expects that in the full core - unstable range @xmath530 , a state with persistent defects should be typically spatio - temporally chaotic .    in the monotonic range ( fig .",

    "the vector cgle ( vcgle ) can be viewed as a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ coupled ] ) for @xmath673 : @xmath674 the problem of nonlinear dynamics of a complex vector field arises most naturally in the context of nonlinear optics , where the order parameter is the electric field envelope in the plane normal to the direction of propagation ; the fields @xmath675 can be identified with the two circularly polarized waves of opposite sense ( gil , 1993 ; pismen , 1994a , b , haelterman and sheppard , 1994 , san miguel , 1995 , hernandez - garcia _ et al _ , 1999 , hoyuelos _ et al _ , 1999 , byryak _ et al _ , 1999 ) .    a distinguished feature of the vgle is the possibility of a transition between two `` phases '' , which can be characterized by either `` mixing '' or `` separation '' of two `` superfluids '' . defects ( vortices ) can exist in both `` superfluids '' , and transitions between alternative core structures are possible ( pismen , 1994 , 1999 ) ; in this sense the real case ( vgle ) could be viewed as a toy model for the 9-component description of superfluid @xmath575he , dressed down to two components .",
    "pismen ( 1994)a , b introduced the notation of `` vector '' and `` scalar '' defects in the vgle .",
    "vector defects have topological charge ( and , therefore , zeros of @xmath675 ) in both fields , whereas scalar defects have non - zero charge only in one of the fields @xmath675 .    simulations of the vcgle by hernndez - garca _ et al _ ( 1999,2000 ) have shown spiral wave patterns with an exceptionally rich structure where both separated ( but closely packed ) `` scalar '' defects in the two fields and `` vector '' defects with a common core could be seen .    a particularly intriguing possibility , suggested by pismen ( 1994)a , is the formation of a bound pair of defects in the two fields , i.e. a vortex `` molecule '' with dipole structure . aranson and pismen ( 2000 ) , have shown that such a `` molecule '' requires complex coefficients .",
    "analytical calculations were conducted in the limit of small coupling @xmath34 between two complex fields . as was shown , the interaction between a well - separated pair of defects in two different fields is always long - range ( power - like ) , in contrast to the interaction between defects in the same field which falls off exponentially as in a single cgle ( aranson , kramer , weber , 1993a ) . in a certain region of parameters of the vcgle stable",
    "rotating bound states of two defects  a `` vortex molecule '' - are found .",
    "two - dimensional oscillatory media exhibit a wide variety of wave phenomena , including spiral waves , phase and defect turbulence etc .",
    "the cgle describes the dynamics of oscillatory media in the vicinity of a primary hopf bifurcation .",
    "et al _ ( 1994 ) , goryachev and kapral ( 1996 ) have shown that spiral waves may also exist in systems with more complex local dynamics , e.g. period - doubling bifurcations or chaos .",
    "in this situation the rotational symmetry of spiral waves may be broken by line synchronization defects .",
    "goryachev _ et al _ ( 1999 ) studied transitions to line defect turbulence in complex oscillatory media supporting spiral waves .",
    "several types of line defect turbulence were found in a system where the local dynamics is described by a chaotic rssler oscillator .",
    "such complex periodic spirals and line - defect turbulence were observed experimentally in chemical systems by park and lee ( 1999 ) .",
    "in this work we attempted to overview a wide variety of dynamic phenomena described by the cgle in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "the cgle exhibits in many respects similar behavior in all dimensions , e.g. active and passive defects , distinct chaotic states , convective and absolute instabilities etc . surprisingly , quantitative aspects of instabilities and transitions are different",
    ". in particular , the core ( acceleration ) instability of 1d nozaki - bekki holes , 2d spirals and 3d vortex filaments has different manifestations : nozaki - bekki holes undergo a stationary instability , spirals exhibit unsaturated hopf bifurcations and 3d vortex filaments show a supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "one observes a general trend in the region of occurrence : 1d defects have the smallest stability domain , 2d spirals are stable in a much wider range of parameters and the stability domain again decreases for 3d vortex filaments .",
    "the unique combination of all these features in one equation stimulates continuous interest in this topic in a broad scientific community .",
    "the insights obtained from the cgle over the last decades had an enormous impact on the physics of non - equilibrium systems , pattern formation , biophysics etc . and will be usefull for further progress in the physics of complex systems .",
    "let us discuss briefly some open problems in the cgle world .",
    "* description of turbulent states in all dimensions .",
    "although considerable work was done to identify the stability limits and transition lines between various turbulent states in the cgle , surprisingly little is known on the statistical properties of these states .",
    "the main obstacle is the lack of appropriate analytical tools , since the traditional methods of statistical physics are not suitable for the description of spatio - temporal chaos . *",
    "the structure and statistical properties of the vortex glass .",
    "the `` glassy '' properties of this state ( such as power - like decay of correlations , hierarchy of the relaxation times etc . ) are not exposed yet .",
    "* the revolutionary development in computers will make possible detailed investigation of the dynamics in 3d cgle .",
    "hopefully , the last two question will be elaborated on during the next decade .",
    "however , the problem of spatio - temporal chaos and turbulence will possibly require considerable time and effort .",

    "<S> the cubic complex ginzburg - landau equation is one of the most - studied nonlinear equations in the physics community . </S>",
    "<S> it describes a vast variety of phenomena from nonlinear waves to second - order phase transitions , from superconductivity , superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation to liquid crystals and strings in field theory . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to give an overview of various phenomena described the complex ginzburg - landau equation in one , two and three dimensions from the point of view of condensed matter physicists . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to study the relevant solutions to get an insight into nonequilibrium phenomena in spatially extended systems .    </S>",
