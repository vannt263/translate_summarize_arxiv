    "roughly , for solar metallicities , the bursts mostly burn helium and have a fast rise when @xmath4 is about 110@xmath2 of the eddington limit ( @xmath5 ) . at higher or lower @xmath4 , they burn mixed hydrogen and helium and have a slower rise and decay . if the accreted matter is dominated by helium , the bursts mostly burn helium , and their properties vary little with the accretion rate . the accreted matter is expected to burn stably at @xmath4 close to or above @xmath5 ( although bursts are seen in some z sources , see below ) . in bright bursts",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the source in the soft state has relatively much weaker emission above 20 kev and is believed to be dominated by emission from the accretion disk and the boundary layer where the accreted matter impacts the ns surface .",

    "the evolution of the color tracks shown in @xcite and @xcite suggests that the atoll - source upper banana branch and the z - source fb as defined by @xcite describe a similar phenomenon , albeit at different luminosities . in this paper",

    "the flux is estimated using a model of a multi - color disk plus a single - temperature blackbody ( bb ) @xcite , with both 2.525 kev and bolometric values given ( unabsorbed ) .",
    "the bolometric flux is obtained analytically as our model consists of two thermal components .",
    "the conversion of flux to luminosity is complicated by uncertainties in several important parameters , such as the source distance , the disk inclination and the occultation factor of the bb , and is therefore not carried out here . instead , we give in table  [ tbl-1 ] the dimensionless flux ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , the ratio of the bolometric persistent flux to the eddington flux inferred from the radius expansion bursts ( see below ) . based on this parameter , the @xmath4 when the bursts are detected is roughly @xmath34 of @xmath5 .",
    "we used a standard procedure to do spectral fits of the three bursts : create time - resolved spectra , use the persistent emission around the burst as background , and fit the spectra with a bb model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we used a 15-s interval that ended 35 s before the burst to define the persistent emission .",
    "event mode data with 64 channels and 125-@xmath35 time resolution were used . only pcus 0 and 2 were on during the observations in which the above three bursts were detected . considering that the spectral calibration of pcu 0 has been bad at energies lower than 10 kev since the loss of the propane layer in 2000 , we only used data from pcu 2 .",
    "we note that @xcite used data from both pcus .",
    "the peak count rates of these bursts are quite high ( @xmath03500 counts / s / pcu ) , but by comparing with the count rates from `` standard1 '' mode data , we found no telemetry saturation in the event mode data .",
    "the integration time of the spectra was set to be 0.5 s around the peak and increased as the count rate decreased to maintain sufficient statistics to constrain the spectral parameters .",
    "an energy range of 3.520 kev was used , and @xmath36 systematic errors were applied .",
    "deadtime corrections , which were as large as 5@xmath2 , were also made as suggested by team .",
    "the response files were created using heasoft version 6.4 .",
    "a hydrogen column density @xmath37 @xmath38 was assumed ; it was inferred from spectral fitting of the persistent emission using simultaneous observations of rxte and swift / xrt @xcite , and is consistent with the value inferred from fitting of quiescence spectra @xcite .",
    "the results of our spectral fits are shown in figure  [ fig : finalplot ] .",
    "there are five panels for each burst ( all with persistent emission background subtracted ) ; pca intensity , bolometric luminosity , bb temperature @xmath39 , bb radius @xmath40 , and reduced @xmath41 are all shown versus time .",
    "the luminosity and radius were calculated at a distance of 8.8 kpc ( see below ) .",
    "the low values of reduced @xmath41 suggest that the net burst spectra are well fit by a bb . the fast rise and slow cooling decay confirm that these bursts are bona fide type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the most important feature that figure  [ fig : finalplot ] shows is that the two brightest bursts ( ii and iii ) show photospheric radius expansion , as indicated by the anti - correlation between the temperature and radius when the luminosity reaches its peak : the temperature decreases from @xmath02.5 kev to @xmath01.8 kev while the radius increases from @xmath010 km to @xmath020 km .",
    "radius expansion bursts are also often studied in terms of the bb luminosity versus the temperature , as shown in figure  [ fig : lumrt ] . in this figure ,",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of the temporal evolution . as shown in the panels for bursts ii and iii",
    ", the source tends to evolve along a horizontal line ( constant luminosity ) during the radius expansion / contraction phase but along a ( dashed ) diagonal line ( constant radius ) during the cooling decay phase .",
    "we use these radius expansion bursts to estimate the distance to . the peak flux in bursts ii and iii are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] with an average value of 41.1@xmath42 erg@xmath9s@xmath7 .",
    "using the empirically determined eddington luminosity @xmath43 ergs@xmath7 for bursts showing photospheric radius expansion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* with uncertainty @xmath44 ) , we derive a distance of 8.8 kpc . using a theoretical expression for the eddington limit ( see equation 8 in @xcite ) and assuming a 1.4 solar - mass ns with a radius of 10 km",
    ", we obtain a distance of 7.3@xmath100.1 kpc for h - poor case ( h - fraction @xmath45 ) and 5.6@xmath100.1 kpc for h - rich case ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we assumed that the peak luminosity is reached when the photosphere has settled back on the ns surface @xcite , which is roughly true in this case ( figure  [ fig : finalplot ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we use the value derived by the empirical method , i.e. , 8.8 kpc .",
    "the other properties of the bursts are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the start time was defined to be the time when the burst flux first exceeded @xmath47 of the peak flux , and the rise time is the interval that it takes for the burst flux to increase from @xmath47 to @xmath48 of the peak value @xcite .",
    "we see that all three bursts rise very rapidly , i.e. , within @xmath01 s. such bursts are probably due to helium burning , which is consistent with the @xmath4 ( @xmath010@xmath2 of @xmath5 ) during these bursts (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the bursts show exponential decays but can not be fit with a single exponential curve .",
    "thus , as in @xcite , we divide the decay ( using the bolometric flux curve ) into two parts and fit each with an exponential curve with independent decay constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these bursts decay rapidly , on time scales of several seconds .",
    "the fluence in table  [ tbl-1 ] is estimated by summing the fluxes over the burst and integrating the final exponential curve to account for the additional flux beyond the data window .",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath14 is the fluence divided by the peak flux .",
    "it is @xmath06 s for all bursts .    as the bursts decay",
    ", the radius tends to remain at an asymptotic value , as also shown in figure  [ fig : lumrt ] , and this is a signal of unstable nuclear burning in the bursts spreading over the whole ns surface @xcite .",
    "we calculate the asymptotic radius in the burst tails using data when the burst flux decays from @xmath49 to @xmath50 of the peak value . the asymtotic radius for each burst is also listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] with an average of 8@xmath101 km at a distance of 8.8 kpc ( corresponding to the dashed line in figure  [ fig : lumrt ] ) .",
    "we note that there is a slight increase in emission area in burst iii as the decay progresses , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : lumrt ] , the cause of which is unknown .",
    "the effects of redshift and spectral hardening should be corrected for in order to obtain the actual size of the ns @xcite .",
    "if a 1.4 solar - mass ns and a hardening factor of 1.4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are assumed , then the actual size of the ns is @xmath51 km .",
    "we searched each burst for coherent pulsations in the frequency range 30 to 4000 hz using fourier techniques .",
    "we computed power spectra throughout each burst using sliding 1 , 2 , 3 and 4-s windows with a step of 0.125 s. the investigated energy bands were 260 , 210 , and 1030 kev .",
    "we found no significant signal . to estimate the upper limits",
    ", we used the set of leahy - normalized power spectra @xcite with a 1-s window so as to take into account possible frequency drifts .",
    "the upper limit for each burst was then determined as follows ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( 1 ) we searched for the largest observed power @xmath52 in the 260 kev band ; ( 2 ) we fit the noise powers of the power spectrum in which we found @xmath52 with a constant plus power law model ; ( 3 ) we divided by the continuum model and multiplied by 2 to re - normalize the power spectrum ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( 4 ) we estimated the upper limits at a 99% confidence level using the groth distribution @xcite .",
    "the pulsed fraction upper limits are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "they are relatively high and not very constraining , compared with the typically observed amplitudes of oscillations of a few ten percent @xcite .",
    "we find three type i x - ray bursts from the 866 pointed observations ( @xmath03 ms ) of the ns transient during its 2006 - 2007 outburst .",
    "these bursts are detected during the decay of the outburst .",
    "the persistent emission of the observations containing these three bursts is weak , with fluxes @xmath1 of the eddington limit .",
    "based on the source state / branch classifications by @xcite , the first burst is detected in the z - source flaring branch ; the second in the flaring / normal branch vertex ; and the third in the atoll - source soft state .",
    "detailed spectral fits confirm these bursts as type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the last two of the three bursts show strong photospheric radius expansion with a peak flux of 41.1@xmath53 erg@xmath9s@xmath7 . assuming an eddington luminosity of @xmath43 ergs@xmath7 @xcite",
    ", we estimate a distance of 8.8 kpc for with @xmath44 systematic uncertainty .",
    "we find no significant burst oscillations between 304000 hz .",
    "the distance to was initially estimated by @xcite .",
    "they gave a distance of @xmath54 kpc by comparing the flux in the nb / fb vertex in a sco - like z - source interval with that of ( which has a distance of @xmath55 kpc , as determined by radio parallax measurements ) .",
    "this value is higher than that derived here using radius expansion bursts .",
    "a possible explanation for such a discrepancy is a difference in the inclination of these two systems .",
    "the orbital inclination of is @xmath0@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the above discrepancy can be explained if has orbital inclination of @xmath57 , as roughly estimated by @xcite based on the weak iron emission lines detected , assuming that the flux is dominated by the disk emission .",
    "the occurrence of the burst near the end of the outburst is consistent with the behavior of changing to that typical of an atoll source .",
    "atoll sources are known to be much more prolific bursters than z sources . among the six classical z sources ,",
    "only has exhibited type i x - ray bursts (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "these sources accrete at high @xmath4 , close to or above @xmath5 , as inferred from its radius expansion bursts . has both short ( @xmath58 s ) and long ( @xmath59 s ) bursts .",
    "burst - like events from are very short ( @xmath60 s ) , and many of them do not show cooling during burst decay . thus their thermonuclear origin is inconclusive @xcite .",
    "is different in that its bursts are detected when it accretes at low @xmath4 , @xmath010@xmath2 of @xmath5 and that all bursts are short ( @xmath61 s ) . from the @xmath4 and the burst profiles ( fast rise and short duration ) ,",
    "these bursts are consistent with helium burning .",
    "such bursts are often seen in the atoll sources in their banana branch @xcite .",
    "thus the unstable nuclear burning in these bursts should fall under the framework of the classical burst theory , indicating that z sources can have regular bursts .",
    "the results that these bursts are consistent with helium burning can also be explained if the ns is accreting h - poor material , as is often seen in ultra - compact x - ray binaries , which have orbital periods of an hour or less and have helium accreted from a degenerate donor .",
    "there is no optical spectrum of the mass donor in to determine whether it is h - poor .",
    "however , the 20062007 outburst is very long ( @xmath020 months ) , while ultra - compact x - ray binaries have never displayed such long outbursts when their light curves can be associated with the class of soft x - ray transients .",
    "thus the mass donor in xte j1701 - 462 is probably a normal star transferring h - rich material .",
    "so far no bursts have been detected in the fb ( except in the nb / fb vertex ) from @xcite , while the thermonuclear origin of the burst - like events from is inconclusive ( see references above ) .",
    "while the detection of burst i from in a low luminosity fb might not be unique , given the abundance of burst in the atoll upper banana branch @xcite , it does cast doubt on the speculation that the z - source fb is caused by unstable nuclear burning @xcite . in  [ sec : reduction ] , we show that burst i does not interfere with the fb behavior , in that no jump in the hardness - intensity diagram is seen before and after the burst . in  [ sec : spectralfit ] , we also show that burst i should have spread over the whole ns surface , since there is constant emission area during the decay .",
    "thus , considering that the fb and bursts are different ( e.g. , bursts rise in seconds , but the fb rises in minutes or longer ) , if the fb is caused by unstable nuclear burning , it must be a different type of nuclear burning from that for bursts , and it can coexist when burst i burns nuclear material globally in .",
    "although we can not simply exclude a complex environment allowing the above scenario , current theoretic studies do not favor coexistence of two types of unstable nuclear burning ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the explanation of unstable nuclear burning for the fb is quite uncertain .",
    "@xcite offered an additional argument that the fb can not be due to unstable nuclear burning , as the energy released to produce the fb would require a much higher @xmath4 than is observed .",
    "@xcite propose an alternative explanation for the fb , in which the inner disk radius contracts temporarily from an eddington - expanded value toward the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "the burst rate depends on @xmath4 and is expected to be zero at @xmath4 close to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "while this is consistent with the fact that we do not observe bursts during the bright phase of the outburst for and in most of z sources , it does raise the question of why the z source gx 17 + 2 shows type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "one possible explanation could be that bursts are possible at high @xmath4 , but only in the narrow @xmath4-range occupied by gx 17 + 2 .",
    "we test this hypothesis by estimating the expected number of bursts from , for the duration when it was similar to .",
    "we estimate that has @xmath00.5-ms of exposure when it resembles , i.e. , with all three sco - like z branches traced out , and thus has a similar @xmath4 as well",
    ". however , has no burst detected in this @xmath00.5-ms interval , while we would have expected to see @xmath06 bursts , based on the burst rate of ( 12 bursts observed in 1 ms with @xcite ) .",
    "thus the burst rate in is much higher than at similar @xmath4 .",
    "it suggests that bursts in are not only due to its specific @xmath4 , but might also depend on other factors such as the ns parameters or the chemical composition of the accreted matter .",
    "the three bursts are detected at @xmath4 @xmath1 @xmath62 , with the burst rate about one per ten hours , considering that the source is observed for several tens of hours around such @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the average value , @xmath012 hours from @xcite or @xmath06 hours from @xcite , corresponding to the above @xmath4 .",

    "<S> they occurred as the source was in transition from the typical z - source behavior to the typical atoll - source behavior , at @xmath1 of the eddington luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the first burst was detected in the z - source flaring branch ; the second in the vertex between the flaring and normal branches ; and the third in the atoll - source soft state . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of the burst in the flaring branch cast doubts on earlier speculations that the flaring branch is due to unstable nuclear burning of accreted matter . </S>",
    "<S> the last two of the three bursts show photospheric radius expansion , from which we estimate the distance to the source to be 8.8 kpc with a 15@xmath2 uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> no significant burst oscillations in the range 30 to 4000 hz were found during these three bursts . </S>"
