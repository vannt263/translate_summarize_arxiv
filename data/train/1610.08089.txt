    "precise optical field measurements including the phase are a prerequisite in many advanced optical systems such as adaptive optics , metrology , 3d imaging , diffractive tomography or super resolution microscopy  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the ideally needed quantity is the complex amplitude of the optical field on a grid of well defined space points . in the case of time",
    "dependent light fields , the complex amplitude becomes a function of frequency .",
    "these data completely characterize optical fields representing the maximum available information for an imaging system .",
    "quantum optical effects can also be included ( section [ qd_optics ] ) .",
    "technologies potentially suitable for such measurements are for instance holography , shack hartmann detectors and sri self referencing interferometers .    in classical holography , a reference beam is needed to generate the hologram .",
    "a hologram contains the information about the complex field amplitude .",
    "however , this holographic step is somewhat arbitrary since the physical optical properties of the light field exist independently of any reference beams .",
    "hence , it should be preferred to extract the holographic information or phase information without referring to a reference beam .",
    "thereby , all external perturbations in the reference path e.g. vibrations , light path disturbances etc . are eliminated .",
    "such a measurement would measure the pure unbiased information of the incoming field .",
    "avoiding the burdensome reference beam is particularly necessary for advanced measurement situations where in principle no good reference beam exists .",
    "this is likely the case for non linear optical effects , for measurements over long macroscopic distances ( field measurements ) or non - classical light ( quantum optics ) .    in conclusion",
    ", it would be very advantageous to measure complex optical amplitudes without depending on the arbitrariness of a reference beam .",
    "shack hartmann detectors  @xcite are well established wavefront detectors . the actually measured quantity is the locally averaged angle of incidence of the incoming light .",
    "the average is taken over the diameter of the individual micro lens .",
    "the angle of incidence is synonymous to the averaged phase derivative over the micro lens aperture .",
    "each lens represents an individual measurement system .",
    "no field comparison is made for light properties between different micro lenses . as a result",
    ", no @xmath1 phase jumps can be detected .",
    "@xmath1 phase jumps can occur in spatial light fields at points where the amplitude of the field becomes zero , for instance in a standing wave .",
    "the detector behind the micro lens might measure two overlapping spots or no light at all . in any case",
    ", the micro lens does not give a valuable signal which can be associated with the @xmath1 phase jump .    in sri self",
    "referencing interferometers the attempt is often undertaken to locally generate a flat zero mode optical field , which serves as a reference beam  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by a spatial band pass such as an illuminated pin hole or single mode fiber leading to a loss of light though .",
    "furthermore , the reference generating process involves some intensity arbitrariness of the reference field .",
    "this introduces noise sources in the overall process .",
    "thus , this kind of sri is not a really satisfying solution yet .",
    "another approach is to measure shearing interferograms and disentangle the electrical fields by solving the associated non linear equation  @xcite .",
    "the method is mainly developed for shearing interferometers and uses an iterative approach which evidently must be damped by a smoothing term  @xcite . in general , convergence and stability is a big challenge in phase reconstruction .",
    "a new method is introduced here which overcomes many limitations of the methods mentioned above .",
    "the associated new device is technically called holocam , an artificial word created from holography and camera . the device is holographic since it uses a holographic type evaluation of holograms or interferograms and it measures something holographic , the complex amplitude .",
    "the device is also a camera such as a ccd camera which registers the locally resolved light intensity on a flat detector .",
    "the holocam does something similar but the registered quantity is the complex amplitude field .",
    "both the ccd and the holocam do not need a reference beam .",
    "the phase is obtained by solving a linear equation .",
    "the solution space of linear equations can be completely characterized .",
    "hence , there is no convergence problem . besides",
    ", it will be shown in section [ sensitivity ] to [ num_res ] that the solution is stable against noise .",
    "this is a remarkable result for phase retrieval which otherwise is often unstable .",
    "as will be shown in section [ ref_bex ] the holocam can directly resolve arbitrary fields including fields with @xmath1 phase jumps .",
    "the holocam method has been experimentally tested using a lateral shearing interferometer .",
    "the holocam in a beam expander setup .",
    "the light enters by the left side and is splitted at beam splitter 1 in two beams .",
    "one beam ( @xmath2 ) passes straightly through the interferometer and hits an imaging plane at the right .",
    "the second beam passes by branch 2 .",
    "branch 2 contains 2 lenses which can be arranged such as to form a beam expander . ]",
    "figure [ bex_setup ] shows an exemplary holocam device .",
    "it consists of a mach zehnder type interferometer with two unequal branches .",
    "the upper branch ( branch 2 ) is longer and contains , in this example , two lenses .",
    "the light enters from the left , is then splitted into two beams and these two beams subsequently come to interference on a screen on the right .",
    "the two lightfields are called @xmath3 , @xmath4 being propagated by branch 1,2 respectively .",
    "the intensity @xmath5 that is measured on the screen can be expressed as    @xmath6    here and in the following @xmath7 denotes the scalar product of the field vectors on every pixel . in equation ( [ eq : basic_if ] )",
    "it is the scalar product between the 3d e - vectors .",
    "@xmath8,@xmath9 are the vectorial first and second electric field , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the location where the field is measured , s being some index of location , such as an index of a pixel . in figure [ bex_setup ]",
    "the pixel is part of the plane where the fields @xmath2 and @xmath11 overlap on the right . to simplify the notation ,",
    "the time variable @xmath12 ( respectively @xmath13 ) is supressed .",
    "the particular meaning should be clear by context . in the following",
    ", @xmath14 stands for a quasi monochromatic field with angular frequence @xmath13 , yielding @xmath15 .",
    "equation [ eq : basic_if ] is actually independent of the factor @xmath16 .",
    "dropping the vector notation and using the abbreviation @xmath17 equation [ eq : basic_if ] becomes    @xmath18    or    @xmath19    or further    @xmath20    here and in the following @xmath21 denotes a point wise multiplication , for instance two pixel vectors @xmath22,@xmath23 are @xmath21 multiplied to yield a new vector @xmath24 of the same dimension with @xmath25 for all pixel indices @xmath26 .",
    "* is essentially different from a scalar product such as @xmath27 since it does not include summation . in most cases , the indices @xmath26 enumerate the pixels of the detector . in some cases ( such as in equation ( [ eq : basic_if2 ] ) )",
    "the running pixel index s is still kept but * is used .",
    "this is actually a redundant expression for the fact that the multiplication is individually performed on every pixel without summation",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : basic_if3 ] ) is the well known interference expression .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 are the amplitudes of the electric field from branch 1,2 respectively .",
    "these quantities can be measured by conventional methods .",
    "subtracting this background in equation ( [ eq : basic_if3 ] ) shows that @xmath30 can be measured .",
    "using known technologies such as phase shifting or carrier phase not only @xmath30 but the full complex interference term can be measured . this quantity is called if .    @xmath31    @xmath32 is a complex field given for all index positions @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath32 will be called a hologram in contrast to @xmath33 which is called the inferogram .    in the following",
    ", it will be assumed that an appropriately designed interferometer is used .",
    "the interferometer should have the property that the set of @xmath34 for all indices @xmath26 is determined by @xmath35 for all indices t. a simple example for such an interferomter is given in section [ ref_bex ] .",
    "furthermore , the index for polarization will be suppressed .",
    "therefore , polarization effects will be neglected . in many cases",
    "this is justified .",
    "if needed all equations can be generalized straightforwardly to include explicit polarization .",
    "the assumption about the polarization is particularly correct if @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same polarization .",
    "then @xmath3 becomes a scalar quantity and the @xmath27 operation in equation ( [ eq : basic_if ] ) can be suppressed .",
    "subsequently , a mapping u from fields in branch 1 to fields in branch 2 will be defined.the mapping is defined on the pixels @xmath36 of the detector .",
    "@xmath37    for matrices a , b the term a b ( without @xmath27 or @xmath21 ) stands , as usual , for the matrix multiplication of two matrices .",
    "b might be a vector ( such as e1 ) in which case a b stands for the matrix multiplication between a b yielding a new vector . in this case , a stands for a linear mapping ( such as u ) .",
    "the linear mapping u : @xmath38 in equation ( [ eq : basic_u ] ) is actually a field propagation .",
    "it can be calculated by solving maxwell s equations . in the simplest case of a mach - zehnder interferometer it represents a back propagation of field e1 from the detection plane given by the locations @xmath39 to a plane before the first beam splitter and thereafter a forward propagation from this plane to the detection plane given again by the locations @xmath40 .",
    "the back propagation is along the first branch of the interferometer and the forward propagation is along the second branch of the interferometer .",
    "hence , u is in fact composed of two propagations .",
    "the propagation could obviously show diffraction effects .",
    "moreover , it is possible to choose appropriate focal lengths @xmath41 , @xmath42 in figure ( [ bex_setup ] ) so that u becomes a point mapping .",
    "the mapping u can only be well defined if the nyquist shannon criterium is respected .",
    "this means that the @xmath1 phase variations of e1 , e2 must not be narrower than the @xmath36 spacing on the detector .",
    "care must also be attributed to signal run off through the borders of the representation space @xmath40 .",
    "the run off of signal strength through the borders might well happen in realistic situations .",
    "this signal strength does not affect the result though as it is not reflected .",
    "the run off of signal strength can be treated physically and numerically exactly . in many cases , it is not too difficult to choose an appropriate design for which u is a well defined physical map .",
    "u is usually injective but not necessarily unitary .",
    "examples for u will be given in section [ ref_bex ] .",
    "for the following section , it is important to state that u represents the physical relationship between e1 and e2 and that u is a property of the measuring device",
    ". it does not depend on the incoming field .",
    "having sufficient knowledge of the used interferometer u can be calculated even though this might involve some calibration steps . once these calibration steps have been properly performed",
    "the matrix u is determined and fixed for subsequent measurements of unknown fields .    for completeness",
    ", it is mentioned that the introduced device is conceived for a certain group of incoming fields .",
    "the allowed group of incoming fields is given by an accepted optical field of view and an allowed incoming field diameter .",
    "these are characteristics well known from other optical measuring devices .",
    "therefore , the restrictions in the applicability of u are not particular but usual for optical devices .    under these circumstances the following equation holds",
    "@xmath43    whenever needed @xmath11 can be expressed by @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "equations ( [ eq : basic_if4 ] ) and ( [ eq : if_1 ] ) are nonlinear equations for the complex field @xmath2 .",
    "this is normally expressed as an e1 optimization problem  @xcite :    @xmath44    equation ( [ eq : opti ] ) is non linear and probably unstable in the general case .    a new approach is proposed in the following which avoids the convergence problem . for this equation ( [ eq : if_1 ] )",
    "is multiplied by @xmath45 yielding    @xmath46    @xmath47    in equation ( [ eq : if_2 ] ) the term @xmath48 can be determined by a conventional intensity measurement . in the following , it is assumed that @xmath48 is already known . having this pre - knowledge in @xmath48 equation [ eq : if_2 ] becomes a linear equation in the unknown complex field @xmath49 .",
    "taking the conjugate complex of equation ( [ eq : if_2 ] ) this can be reformulated as an equation for @xmath2 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fund_eq ] ) is a compact formulation in matrix notation called the fundamental equation in this context . to the best available knowledge",
    "this reformulation of the phase problem has remained unnoticed up to now .",
    "the fundamental equation ( [ eq : if_2 ] , [ eq : fund_eq ] ) represents an exact , simple and linear equation for the complex amplitude of field @xmath50 .",
    "the measured quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 enter the equation as coefficients .",
    "the solution space of linear equations is well known .",
    "hence , the difficulties arising from equation ( [ eq : opti ] ) are avoided . in the subsequent sections ( sections [ sensitivity ] , [ ref_bex ] , [ preconditioning ] )",
    ", the uniqueness and stability of equation ( [ eq : fund_eq ] ) will be analyzed for properly designed devices .",
    "for stability analysis a calculation of the functional derivative would be adequate .",
    "this is a high dimensional object equivalent to a perturbation expansion as known from quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the notation of messiah will be used in the following .",
    "the approach allows us to understand the mechanisms responsible for the perturbation ( error ) propagation .",
    "a perturbation term is introduced in equation ( [ eq : if_2 ] ) and the new solution is expanded as a function of the perturbation term .",
    "the linear operator @xmath53 of the unperturbed problem is introduced :    @xmath54    the exact solution of the unperturbed problem corresponds to a zero eigenvalue .",
    "secondly , a perturbed operator h is defined    @xmath55    p stands for perturbed .",
    "@xmath56 can no longer be expected to be an eigenvector to the eigenvalue zero .",
    "in fact , some decision has to be made concerning how to define a solution for the perturbed problem .",
    "the option chosen here is to look for the adiabatic eigenvector as a function of the perturbation .",
    "this is equivalent to looking for the lowest eigenvalue of the perturbed problem equation ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) .",
    "another possible approach would be to find a least square solution of ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the lowest singular value solution of ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath57 represents measurement errors in the determination of the hologram @xmath58 . as @xmath58 also @xmath57 is an array of complex numbers .",
    "@xmath2 denotes an eigenvector of the unperturbed system for the eigenvalue zero .",
    "contrary to quantum mechanics , neither @xmath53 nor @xmath57 are self adjunct operators . however , without too much loss of generality we assume a non degenerate spectrum of @xmath53 and consequently a complete set @xmath59 , @xmath60 of left and right hand eigenvectors , defined as    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    respectively .",
    "normalization is chosen such as    @xmath63    and    @xmath64    holds .",
    "@xmath65 are the complex eigenvalues of @xmath53 .",
    "all vectors are tupels in @xmath26 - index space of pixels .",
    "the bra - vectors @xmath59 are not normalized with respect to the complex scalar product @xmath66 but with respect to the kronecker product equation ( [ eq : hdef3 ] ) .    using this notation the perturbation theory known from quantum mechanics",
    "can be used  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an expansion parameter @xmath67 is introduced which will be set to @xmath68 later .",
    "@xmath69    and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors become    @xmath70    @xmath71 is the eigenvalue which evolves from the lowest eigenvalue @xmath72 of the unperturbed system . if no other perturbations are present @xmath73 and @xmath74 equal zero ( for the fundamental equation ) .",
    "@xmath75    by definition the relation @xmath76 holds .",
    "@xmath77 is the eigenvector to the eigenvalue @xmath78 of the perturbed problem .    according to messiah@xcite the operator @xmath79 is introduced    @xmath80    this yields the following iterative solution    @xmath81    @xmath82\\ ] ]    in the first order the following formula holds    @xmath83\\ ] ]    since @xmath84 by definition this",
    "can be further simplified to    @xmath85    equation ( [ eq:1st_order_compact ] ) is the desired simple small scale formula describing error propagation in the fundamental equation ( [ eq : fund_eq ] ) .    in the next two sections ( sections [ ref_bex ] to [ num_res ] )",
    "this formalism will be used to study a simple reference case .",
    "the error propagation matrix in formula ( [ eq:1st_order_compact ] ) is still a high dimensional object .",
    "therefore , it is favorable to condense the result to a single key number further .",
    "@xmath86 expresses how much the solution of the perturbed problem deviates from the exact ( or correct ) solution .",
    "hence , it is appropriate to calculate the standard deviation for @xmath86 .",
    "this is the vector norm of @xmath86 divided by @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the number of detection points .",
    "the standard deviation is    @xmath89    the result still depends on the scaling of e1 .",
    "the reference for the signal strength is the average of e1 .",
    "thus , as usual in signal - to - noise figures the expression for the standard deviation ( the noise ) is divided by the mean signal strength @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91    this yields the following quality ( or s / n ) parameter called @xmath92 :    @xmath93    for @xmath57 a similar measure can be found :    @xmath94    the following characteristic number for the error propagation in the system can be defined :    @xmath95    this ratio is called the error amplification factor .",
    "for the phase error a normalized standard deviation can also be defined :    @xmath96    no reference to the signal size is necessary since the variation of the phase error is always limited by @xmath97 .",
    "there are two possible origins of @xmath98 , either a , for instance , gaussian random noise source or a projection of the signal if on a discrete integer space given by the bit space of the detector .",
    "the difference to the unprojected value is the error caused by the detector quantization . for the calculation of the error amplification factor the origin of @xmath98 is not of primary importance since every noise source is condensed to a @xmath99 .",
    "nevertheless , the process of error generation slightly influences the value @xmath100 . in the following",
    ", the type of noise generation will be noted for numerical results yielding two cases , either gaussian noise or quantization noise .",
    "the following quantity @xmath101 for quantization noise is particularly interesting because it is independent of any normalization :    @xmath102    @xmath103 is the bit number of the signal if , i.e. @xmath104 means that the signal if is projected on a 10 bit number .",
    "the difference between the exact value if and the projected value is just @xmath57 .    in the subsequent section [ ref_bex ] ,",
    "a simple holocam system will be designed ( the beam expander holocam ) . in the section [ num_res ]",
    "the error amplification factor @xmath105 and the lowest eigenvalue separation @xmath106 will be calculated for the the beam expander holocam .",
    "one of the simplest systems to study is a one dimensional system with a mach zehnder interferometer ( figure [ bex_setup ] ) .",
    "the system could for instance be built using a linear detector array .",
    "hence , the terminus one - dimensional only concerns the detector . in the second branch ,",
    "a lens system is installed in such a way that the detector plane self mapped by u becomes a conjugate plane .",
    "this means a field point in the detector plane back propagated by branch one and then forward propagated by branch two ( including the mapping by the lens system ) becomes again a point image in the detector plane .",
    "the mapping u is thus a point mapping .",
    "an ideal system is assumed neglecting any aberrations in the optical system .",
    "if this was not the case the aberrations could be included in u. this is without relevance for the stability analysis though .",
    "the expansion ratio of the beam expander is called @xmath107 and if not otherwise stated @xmath108 is used .",
    "@xmath108 means that the image of the detection plane is expanded by a factor of two .",
    "the point mapping u applied in the discrete pixel space implies some interpolation since the mapping @xmath109 to @xmath110 needs to be accomplished by field values of @xmath11 at intermediate pixels at @xmath111 .",
    "this does not imply any loss of information .",
    "interpolation will be further discussed in section [ discretization ] .",
    "a simplification is made by assuming a one dimensional detector array .",
    "this systems can actually be built .",
    "the detector space not the propagation space is one dimensional .",
    "this assumption does not affect the results .",
    "besides , general 2d problems will be studied later on in section [ num_res ] .    in the case of 50 detector points and for a selected pixel range from 20 to 30",
    "this could be representetd by the following u matrix :    @xmath112\\ ] ]    this is called geometric interpolation , @xmath113 .",
    "the same kind of interpolation can also be made in fourier space .",

    ", the fourier representation of the field , which is a continuous function , is evaluated at intermediate points .",
    "this interpolation will be called fourier interpolation yielding @xmath114 .    from the preceding ,",
    "it is obvious that some points are , as a consequence of discretization , calculated by interpolation . even in this simple case u",
    "can not be represented by a strict point mapping .",
    "the latter would be necessary if one wished to take a pointwise logartithm of equation ( [ eq : basic_if5 ] ) as done in reference @xcite .",
    "the error becomes small for very smooth fields with little or no amplitude variation which is not the case for general fields though .",
    "logartithm of equation ( [ eq : basic_if5 ] ) is consequently no option for solving the non linear equation ( [ eq : opti ] ) .    in the following",

    "no further random quantity is needed .",
    "otherwise , @xmath57 must be defined explicitly by another random field .",
    "for this , a gaussian random field with a standard deviation @xmath99 is chosen .    in brief ,",

    "e1 is an eigenvector of the exact fundamental equation , expressed as @xmath53 . due to measurement errors ( perturbations )",
    "not @xmath53 but some @xmath125 is measured or known .",
    "the question is what kind of property of @xmath125 has to be determined to recover the best approximation of e1 ?    in section [ sensitivity ] this has been done by looking for the eigenvector of the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "although this is a valuable strategy it is not necessarily the best one .",
    "apart from that , equation ( [ eq : fund_eq ] ) can also be solved by minimizing the residual ( least square solution ) .",

    "the problem of finding a solution of a general homogeneous vector equation @xmath126 is invariant under left side multiplication by any matrix f , yielding    @xmath127    of course this invariance does not hold for non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : gen_homo ] ) yields different solutions for different preconditioning matrices f. in particular for a perturbed problem ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) the solutions are no longer equivalent .",
    "thus , in case of noise influences different starting points for the solution strategy can be chosen .",
    "some of the different strategies are mentioned below :    1 .",
