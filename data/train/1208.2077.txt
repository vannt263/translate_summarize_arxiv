    "strong field physics has been an active research field since the invention of the technique chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) in 1985 @xcite , which draws the intensity of tabletop laser from gigwatt to erawatt @xcite and makes it possible to test the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory in laboratories @xcite . the stanford linac acceleration ( slac )",
    "experiment in 1997 @xcite have observed electrons - positrons ( @xmath0 ) pair production and revealed nonlinear qed effects , which have resurrected research interests in pair creation in strong fields . the forthcoming extreme - light - infrastructure ( eli )",
    "@xcite will surely boost breakthrough in strong field physics research .",
    "this will be the strongest field in the world , though its intensity is approximately about @xmath1 and still 4 orders less than the schwinger s critical field intensity @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "several methods in both of theory and numeric calculation have been proposed to analyze pair production in external fields since 1930s @xcite .",
    "one of the most important approaches is the perturbation method in which the corresponding volkov states are used as bases .",
    "it was pioneered by volkov @xcite , and developed by reiss @xcite , nikishov @xcite , mller @xcite , keitel @xcite and so on .",
    "but all of the above studies are based on particular polarized laser fields with either circular or linear polarization @xcite .",
    "most studies have manifested that the pair production rates are larger in linearly polarized fields compared than that in circular ones @xcite in some conditions . albeit these progresses which have been achieved ,",
    "no complete analytical or numerical studies have been performed to reveal the influence of laser fields with arbitrary polarization on pair creation , especially in the framework of perturbation method even though this method seems simple and valid for the problem .",
    "the reason may be that relatively tedious derivation of scattering amplitude and cross section is involved in that case of elliptic polarization where the scattering partial waves have many coupled terms .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to fill this research gap by exploring the relation between the elliptically polarized laser fields and pair production , which will give more insight into the slac experiment .",
    "our study will show that a better pair production by elliptically polarized laser field can occur possibly .",
    "if we have got more information and recognition , it will be helpful not only to uncover more phenomena but also to regulate involved parameters in future experiments .    in the present paper",
    ", we will deal with one of these problems , through difficult theoretical and computing calculations .",
    "the case of head - on collision , occurring between a high - energy gamma photon and multiple photons of the laser fields , is considered .",
    "this process is called multi - photon reaction . fortunately , we get the strict result in the framework of first order perturbation theory , and give thoroughly numerical calculations of some fixed parameters",
    ". there is , in fact , a surprising result that the pair creation relies strongly on the parameters of the laser fields , especially @xmath3 ( describing the elliptical polarization ) in the condition that @xmath4 ( the lorentz - invariant dimensionless strength parameter @xcite ) could be compared with @xmath5 ( the collision energy ) .",
    "the optimal filed is not the linearly polarized field , but in some cases it is elliptically polarized and sometimes even the circularly polarized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , in sec.ii , we give a concrete theoretical derivation of the total cross section in the first order perturbation theory using the volkov states wave functions . in sec .",
    "iii , we present some demonstrations of numerical results which show clearly and vividly how pair creation is influenced by a few important parameters such as the polarization @xmath3 , the lorentz - invariant normalized field strength @xmath6 , and the collision energy @xmath5 .",
    "the main results will be summarized and some insights and discussions are given briefly in the final section .",
    "in this section , we give a detailed derivation of the total pair production in the interaction between strong laser field and high energy photon .",
    "some techniques used here are employed and developed from ref .",

    "surprisingly , neither linear nor circular but the elliptically polarized field corresponds to the optimal pair creation cross section in some cases shown in table [ table2 ] and table [ table3 ] .",
    "our numerical results have also demonstrated that the leading contribution in the pair production comes from the first term subject to @xmath182 , when the polarization is nearly linear ; moreover , things begin to change as larger @xmath92 is considered , since @xmath91 for larger @xmath92 is prone to the circular one .",
