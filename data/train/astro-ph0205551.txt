    "the suggestion of an association of the type ib / c sn1998bw with the @xmath0-ray burst grb980425 may provide evidence for another new phenomenon generated by sne  at least some types of grbs may originate in some types of sn explosions . because sn1998bw / grb980425 is by far the nearest and best studied of the @xmath0-ray bursters , it is worthwhile to examine its radio emission in detail before proceeding to the discussion of the radio emission from other grbs .",
    "while generally accepted that most grbs are extremely distant and energetic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the discovery of grb980425 @xcite on 1998 april 25.90915 and its possible association with a bright supernova , sn1998bw at ra(j2000 ) = @xmath2 , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath3 @xcite , in the relatively nearby spiral galaxy eso  184-g82 at @xmath4 ( distance @xmath5 mpc for @xmath6 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 ) @xcite , has introduced the possibility of a sn origin for at least some types of grbs . the estimated explosion date of sn1998bw in 1998 between april 21  27 @xcite corresponds rather well with the time of the grb980425 outburst .",
    "iwamoto et al.@xcite felt that they could restrict the core collapse date for sn1998bw even more from hydrodynamical modeling of exploding c + o stars and , assuming that the sn1998bw optical light curve is energized by @xmath8ni decay as in type ia sne , they then placed the coincidence between the core collapse of sn1998bw to within @xmath9/@xmath10 days of the outburst detection of grb980425 .",
    "classified initially as an sn optical type ib @xcite , then type ic @xcite , then peculiar type ic @xcite , then later , at an age of  300 - 400 days , again as a type ib @xcite , sn1998bw presents a number of optical spectral peculiarities that strengthen the suspicion that it may be the counterpart of the @xmath0-ray burst .    when the more precise nfi was pointed at the error box 10 hours after the detection of grb980425 , two x - ray sources were present @xcite .",
    "one of these , named s1 by pian et al.@xcite , was coincident with the position of sn 1998bw and declined slowly between 1998 april and 1998 november . the second x - ray source , s2 , that was @xmath11 from the position of sn 1998bw , was not ( or at best only marginally with a @xmath12 possible detection six days after the initial detection ) detectable again in follow up observations in 1998 april , may , and november @xcite .",
    "however , although concern remains that the pian et al.@xcite x - ray source , s2 , might have been the brief afterglow from grb980425 rather than the pian source s1 associated with sn1998bw , pian et al.@xcite concluded that s1 has a `` high probability '' of being associated with grb980425 and that s2 is more likely a variable field source .",
    "the radio emission from sn 1998bw reached an unusually high 6 cm spectral luminosity at peak of @xmath13 erg s@xmath7 hz@xmath7 , i.e. ,  @xmath14 times higher than either of the well studied , very radio luminous type iin sne sn 1986j and sn 1988z , and @xmath5 times higher than the average peak 6 cm",
    "spectral luminosity of type ib / c sne .",
    "it also reached this 6 cm peak rather quickly , only @xmath15 days after explosion .",
    "sn 1998bw is unusual in its radio emission , but not extreme .",
    "for example , the time from explosion to peak 6 cm luminosity for both sn 1987a and sn 1983n was shorter and , in spite of the fact that sn1998bw has been called `` the most luminous radio supernova ever observed , '' its 6 cm spectral luminosity at peak is exceeded by that of sn 1982aa @xcite .",
    "however , sn 1998bw is certainly the most radio luminous type ib / c radio supernova ( rsn ) observed so far by a factor of @xmath16 and it reached this higher radio luminosity very early .",
    "although unique in neither the speed of radio light curve evolution nor in peak 6 cm radio luminosity , sn1998bw is certainly unusual in the combination of these two factors  very radio luminous very soon after explosion .",
    "kulkarni et al.@xcite have used these observed qualities , together with the lack of interstellar scintillation ( iss ) at early times , brightness temperature estimates , and physical arguments to conclude that the blastwave from sn1998bw that gives rise to the radio emission must have been expanding relativistically . on the other hand ,",
    "waxman & loeb @xcite argued that a sub - relativistic blastwave can generate the observed radio emission .",
    "however , both sets of authors agree that a very high expansion velocity ( @xmath17 ) is required for the radio emitting region under a spherical geometry .",
    "simple arguments confirm this high velocity . to avoid the well known compton catastrophe , kellermann & pauliny - toth @xcite",
    "have shown that the brightness temperature @xmath18 k must hold and readhead @xcite has better defined this limit to @xmath19 k. from geometrical arguments , such a limit requires the radiosphere of sn1998bw to have expanded at an apparent speed @xmath20 km  s@xmath7  , at least during the first few days after explosion .",
    "although such a value is only mildly relativistic ( @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ) , it is still unusually high . however , measurements by gaensler et al.@xcite and manchester et al.@xcite have demonstrated that the radio emitting regions of the type ii sn1987a expanded at an average speed of @xmath23 km  s@xmath7  ( @xmath24 ) over the 3 years from 1987 february to mid-1990 so that , in a very low density environment , such as one finds around type ib / c sne , very high blastwave velocities appear to be possible .      an obvious comparison of sn1998bw with other radio supernovae ( rsne ) is the evolution of its radio flux density at multiple frequencies and its description by known rsn models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the radio data available at http://www.narrabri .",
    "atnf.csiro.au/@xmath25mwiering/grb/grb980425/ are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1-kw ] .",
    "sn1998bw shows an early peak that reaches a maximum as early as day 10  12 at 8.64 ghz , a minimum almost simultaneously for the higher frequencies ( @xmath26 2.5 ghz ) at day @xmath25 20  24 , then a secondary , somewhat lower peak after the first dip .",
    "an interesting characteristic of this `` double humped '' structure is that it dies out at lower frequencies and is relatively inconspicuous in the 1.38 ghz radio measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1-kw ] ) .",
    "such a `` double humped '' structure of the radio light curves can be reproduced by a single energy blastwave encountering differing csm density regimes as it travels rapidly outward .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because complex density structure in the csm surrounding sne , giving rise to structure in the radio light curves , is very well known in such objects as sn1979c @xcite , sn1980k @xcite , and , particularly , sn1987a @xcite .",
    "weiler et al.@xcite pointed out what has not been previously recognized , that there is a sharp drop in the radio emission near day @xmath27 and a single measurement epoch at day 192 that is significantly ( @xmath28 ) higher at all frequencies than expected from the preceding data on day 149 and the following data on day 249 .",
    "weiler et al .  were able to explain both of these temporary increases in radio emission by the sn blastwave encountering physically similar shells of enhanced density .",
    "the first enhancement or `` bump '' after the initial outburst peak is estimated to start on day 25 and end on day 75 , i.e. ,  having a duration of @xmath29 days and turn - on and turn - off times of about 12 days , where the radio emission ( @xmath30 ) increased by a factor of 1.6 and absorption ( @xmath31 ) increased by a factor of 2.0 implying a density enhancement of @xmath32 for no change in clump size .",
    "exactly the same density enhancement factor and length of enhancement is compatible with the `` bump '' observed in the radio emission at day 192 ( i.e. ,  the single measurement within the 100 day gap between measurements on day 149 and day 249 ) , even though the logarithmic time scale of fig .",
    "[ fig1-kw ] makes the time interval look much shorter .",
    "the decreased sampling interval has only one set of measurements altered by the proposed day 192 enhancement , so weiler et al.@xcite could not determine its length more precisely than @xmath33 days .",
    "li & chevalier @xcite proposed an initially synchrotron self - absorbed , rapidly expanding blastwave in a @xmath34 circumstellar wind model to describe the radio light curve for sn 1998bw .",
    "this is in many ways similar to the chevalier @xcite model for type ib / c sne , that also included synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) . to produce the first bump in the radio light curves of sn1998bw ,",
    "li & chevalier postulated a boost of blastwave energy by a factor of @xmath35 on day @xmath2522 in the observer s time frame .",
    "they did not discuss the second bump .",
    "modeling of the radio data for sn 1998bw with the well established formalism for rsne presented by weiler et al.@xcite shows that such an energy boost is not needed .",
    "a fast blastwave interacting with a dense , slow , stellar wind - established , ionized csm , that is modulated in density over time scales similar to those seen for rsne , can produce a superior fit to the data .",
    "no blastwave re - acceleration is required and no ssa at early times is apparent .",

    "all of the rgrbs except for grb980425/sn1998bw have similar observed peak 6 cm radio spectral luminosities of @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that grbs are rare objects for which one must survey very large volumes of space in order to detect examples .",
    "such examples are , therefore , generally at very large distances and we detect only the brightest members of the luminosity distribution .",
    "grb980425/sn1998bw is the only known nearby , lower luminosity exception .",
    "the prevalence of interstellar scintillation ( iss ) in the early radio emission from many of these objects implies that the rgrbs are initially very small in angular size although they expand rapidly .",
    "although many useful conclusions can be drawn from the light curve parameterizations , one should keep in mind that a more detailed study of radio grbs will have to take into account several physical effects that are not seen in rsne , and that have not been included in this brief overview , but need further consideration .      because their high radio luminosity and low absorption allows detection at great distance and quite early when they are still of very small angular size , grb radio afterglows appear to be so compact as to exhibit iss during the first few days or weeks of detectability .",
    "this possibility was proposed by goodman @xcite for grb970508 based on earlier work by rickett @xcite for pulsars .",
    "after consideration of the several regimes of strong , weak , refractive , and diffractive scattering , goodman @xcite concluded that both diffractive and refractive scintillation are possible for radio afterglows and that observation of the effects of scintillation can place limits on their @xmath68as ( micro - arcsecond ) sizes at levels far too small to be resolved with vlbi .",
    "* grb970508 * shows strong flux density fluctuations at both 8.46 and 4.86 ghz until age @xmath254 weeks after explosion , that waxman et al .",
    "@xcite attributed to diffractive scintillation .",
    "after @xmath251 month , they found that the modulation amplitude decreased , which is consistent with the diffractive scintillation being quenched by the increased size of the radio emitting region .",
    "they also took this increasing source size to be consistent with , and supportive of , the `` fireball '' model predictions ( see @xmath40 [ fireball ] ) . from their 4.86 and 8.46 ghz results ,",
    "waxman et al.@xcite concluded that the quenching of diffractive scintillation at @xmath254 weeks implies a size at that epoch of @xmath100 cm and an expansion speed comparable to that of light .",
    "in contrast to the conclusion of waxman et al.@xcite that grb970508 is undergoing strong diffractive scintillation during the first 30 days after explosion , smirnova & shishov @xcite concluded that the radio afterglow is , in fact , undergoing only weak scintillation at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz at early times with refractive scintillation dominating at 1.43 ghz .",
    "* grb980329 * shows rapid flux density fluctuations at 4.9 and 8.3 ghz that are extinguished by age @xmath253 weeks .",
    "although they did not analyze the scintillation data in detail , taylor et al.@xcite pointed out a similarity to the better studied scintillations of grb970508 and suggested that the early - time angular size of grb980329 may be even smaller than the @xmath25 3 @xmath68as inferred for grb970508 by goodman @xcite and waxman et al.@xcite because grb980329 is at a lower galactic latitude , that should more quickly quench iss .",
    "* grb980519 * shows strong modulation of the flux density at 4.86 and 8.46 ghz during the first @xmath2520 days after the grb burst , that frail et al.@xcite interpreted as being due to diffractive iss .",
    "they derived a resulting maximum radio source size of @xmath101 0.4 @xmath68as , an extremely compact object .",
    "as was seen for grb970508 , the 1.4 ghz emission from grb980519 seems to be suppressed , in this case below their detectability limit because their three measurements at 1.4 ghz are all upper limits .",
    "frail et al.@xcite attributed this suppression to synchrotron selfabsorption ( ssa ) with a turn - over frequency between 1.43 and 4.86 ghz .      because the grbs are at cosmological distances ( @xmath102 ) , there are two effects that must be taken into account :    1 .",
    "there is a time dilation that slows the light curve evolution in the observer s frame with respect to the time evolution in the emission frame .",
    "this is a straightforward correction and has been elaborated by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the time dilation results in a true emitted time to 6 cm peak flux density [ @xmath103 shorter than that actually observed [ @xmath104 .",
    "the correction takes the form + @xmath105 + and must be applied to the measured times from explosion to 6 cm peak flux density to obtain true times .",
    "2 .   there is a correction of the observed flux density , @xmath106 , owing to the redshift making the observed frequency different from that emitted , @xmath107 , for sources with non - zero spectral indices .",
    "the correction normally takes the form , for @xmath108 , + @xmath109 + however , chevalier & li @xcite have proposed an `` equality of peaks '' on theoretical grounds so that such a correction may be less important than expected .      essentially all researchers agree that the grb phenomenon involves relativistic motion of the emitting region . whether the motion involves a spherical , relativistic fireball or a directed relativistic jet is probably not of concern from the radio observer s standpoint because the emission from the csm interaction is probably not highly directed .    for relativistic corrections",
    "there are two factors  the relativistic motion factor @xmath110 [ @xmath22 ] and , if the motion is directed , the viewing angle @xmath112 .",
    "if , as expected , the radio emission is not highly directed , then taking @xmath113 leaves only the relativistic motion factor @xmath110 to be determined .",
    "the factor @xmath110 is difficult to estimate from observations .",
    "theoretical modeling predicts @xmath110 of several hundred very early in the expansion phase @xcite declining to subrelativistic motion after only a few days to a few weeks @xcite .",
    "however , although highly speculative , there is , perhaps , one method for estimating @xmath110 .",
    "weiler et al.@xcite pointed out that by assuming a relation between type ib sn1998bw and grb980425 , they could obtain estimates of @xmath114 1.6  2.0 for the radio afterglow .",
    "they obtained one estimate by postulating that sn1998bw was expanding at @xmath25230,000 km  s@xmath7  if its brightness temperature at 6 cm peak flux density was @xmath115 k , as required by the inverse compton limit",
    ". the second estimate was obtained by assuming that the true 6 cm peak spectral luminosity was the same as that for the average of all known type ib / c rsne .",
    "then , if one assumes : ( a ) all grb radio afterglows arise in type ib / c sne and ( b ) the postulate of weiler et al.@xcite that all type ib / c sne may be approximate standard radio candles with an @xmath116 , and ( c ) any increase in the observed flux density is solely due to relativistic boosting , then one can estimate a relativistic @xmath110 factor for each grb radio afterglow .",
    "applying these assumptions to the peak 6 cm radio luminosity ( @xmath117 ) values obtained for the grbs and listed in table  [ tab2-kw ] , we obtain @xmath110 values @xmath118 .",
    "such @xmath110s are similar to those found for vlbi `` superluminal '' sources ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and for the galactic micro - qso superluminal sources @xcite .",
    "the origin of @xmath0-ray bursts is a long standing problem dating back to the 1960s . with little actual data to constrain them ,",
    "many theories were developed .",
    "ruderman @xcite first summarized these in the mid-1970s .",
    "cavallo & rees @xcite were probably the first to use the term `` fireball '' in an article discussing several possibilities for the conversion of massive amounts of injection energy into @xmath0-rays , including the possibility of relativistic expansion and the conversion of kinetic energy into @xmath0-ray luminosity through the impact on an external medium .",
    "the 1980s brought the more detailed calculations of paczynski @xcite and goodman @xcite that suggested that the grbs might be at cosmological distances of @xmath102 or more and that the energies involved were at least comparable to that expected from an sn ( @xmath119 ergs ) . in the 1990s , of course , the field finally came of age with the to provide almost daily detections of grbs and to provide rapid followup for many bursts and accurate position determination for x - ray afterglows .",
    "this increased data flow refined the model studies for the origin of grbs so that there are basically only two models presently under serious consideration ",
    "relativistic fireball and relativistic jet .",
    "because of the observational ( particularly radio ) orientation of this review , we shall not discuss the mechanisms for the source of the energy release , whether neutron star or black hole formation in sne , coalescence of compact objects , or more exotic phenomena .",
    "we shall be more concerned with the observable consequences of this great energy release and , where possible , similarities to known phenomena .",
    "many workers have concluded that the relativistic fireball model is the most likely scenario for grb creation and most prefer conversion of the blastwave energy into emission through blastwave interaction with an external medium .",

    "he felt that such a scenario can better solve the `` energy problem '' ( where some estimates of relativistic fireball energies can range up to a rather high @xmath128 ergs ) , the short time variability of many grbs , and other apparent deviations from the relativistic fireball models .",
    "a somewhat different variant on the fireball model has been proposed by paczynski @xcite who suggested that a `` hypernova '' explosion produces a `` dirty '' fireball from the violent death of a massive star .",
    "livio & waxman @xcite took the broader stance that the grbs with afterglows , although probably not originating in neutron star ",
    "neutron star ( ns - ns ) mergers , could well have several possible origins including the collapse of massive stars as in sne ( grb980519 and grb980326 ) or could be produced by black hole - he star mergers ( grb990123 and grb990510 ) , with a third group such as grb970228 and grb970508 being possibly produced by black hole - he star mergers but without collimated jets being formed by the collapse .",
    "they disagreed with other workers that the transition from relativistic expansion to non - relativistic expansion of a spherical fireball will produce a detectable break in the afterglow decline rate .",
    "they also felt that the grbs creating detectable afterglows are diverse with only some producing highly collimated jets , but with all originating from massive stars and all interacting with a stellar wind environment .",
    "perhaps the broadest summary and comparison of models with radio data for several grbs previous to this review is that given by chevalier & li @xcite ( see also , @xcite ) who were able to describe rather well the radio light curves of several grb radio afterglows as arising from blastwave interaction with an external medium .",
    "they also suggested that there is evidence for two groupings : ( a ) grbs arising from the explosion of a massive star , possibly a wolf - rayet star , embedded in a dense @xmath34 stellar wind - formed csm and accompanied by a supernova , and ( b ) grbs arising from the explosion caused by a compact binary merger that occur in a constant density ism and are not accompanied by a supernova .",
    "we have assembled an overview of the radio emission from grbs and have shown that there are many similarities to the much better understood radio emission from rsne . in particular , we have shown that the formalism described by weiler et al.@xcite can be applied to the radio and oir emission from a number of grbs and provides a satisfactory description of their light curves over extremely broad frequency and time ranges .",

    "<S> since 1997 the afterglow of @xmath0-ray bursting sources ( grbs ) has occasionally been detected in the radio , as well in other wavelengths bands . in particular , the interesting and unusual @xmath0-ray burst grb980425 , thought to be related to the radio supernova sn1998bw , is a possible link between the two classes of objects . analyzing the extensive radio emission data available for sn1998bw </S>",
    "<S> , one can describe its time evolution within the well established framework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> this then allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical properties of the object . </S>",
    "<S> the radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of a mildly relativistic ( @xmath1 ) shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind - established circumstellar medium ( csm ) that is highly structured both azimuthally , in clumps or filaments , and radially , with observed density enhancements . </S>",
    "<S> because of its unusual characteristics for a type ib / c supernova , the relation of sn1998bw to grb980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes of grbs originate in supernova ( sn ) massive star explosions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , employing the formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae ( sne ) and following the link through sn1998bw / grb980425 , it is possible to model the gross properties of the radio and optical / infrared ( oir ) emission from the half - dozen grbs with extensive radio observations . from this </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that at least some members of the `` slow - soft '' class of grbs can be attributed to the explosion of a massive star in a dense , highly structured csm that was presumably established by the preexplosion stellar system . </S>"
