    "the line broadening of several ten kms@xmath0 is dominated by the velocity distribution of the escaping gas . for comparison , the rotational velocity of the dust torus @xmath175  kms@xmath0 for the inner parts , and the thermal doppler broadening from eq .",
    "( [ eq : doppler ] ) at @xmath176  k is @xmath177  kms@xmath0 for h@xmath130 and @xmath178  kms@xmath0 for oiii .",
    "figures  [ fig : lines3 ] and [ fig : lines4 ] show the line profiles for the models a ( no scattering of h - ionizing photons ) and c ( calculated assuming non - negligible uv scattering during the hydrodynamical evolution ) from paper  ii .",
    "uv scattering leads to stronger illumination of the neutral torus by ionizing radiation and thus to a higher photoevaporation rate in model c ( by a factor of @xmath179 ) compared to model a. due to the higher density in the regions filled with photoevaporated gas , the lines for model c are generally more intense . in the case of the line [ oii ]",
    "3726 one notices that the difference between the fluxes for different angles is the smallest of all transitions . not only is the density of the outflowing ionized gas higher for case  c , but the charge exchange reactions discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : chargeex ] lead to the establishment of a non - negligible oii - abundance even in the `` shadow '' regions not accessible to direct stellar illumination .",
    "these regions dominate the line spectra for all angles .",
    "figures  [ fig : lines1 ] and [ fig : lines2 ] show the calculated line profiles for the models g2 , g3 and g4 , which only differ by the assumed stellar wind velocity @xmath136 , increasing from 400  kms@xmath0 ( g2 ) to 1000  kms@xmath0 ( g4 ) . comparing the results we find two features :    1 .",
    "the intensity and overall structure of the line profiles considered are almost independent of the stellar wind velocity @xmath136 .",
    "no high - velocity component appears in the lines due to the stellar wind .",
    "both features can be explained by the fact that the density of material contained in the stellar wind is much lower than the density in the photoionized outflow .",
    "remembering that @xmath180 in a steady - state outflow and that the line emissivity @xmath181 , we can understand why the low expansion velocities of about @xmath182  kms@xmath0 ( i.e. material close to the torus ) dominate the spectra .",
    "the overall evaporation rates as well as the expansion velocities are almost equal for all three models , leading to very similar line profiles .",
    "it would be necessary to consider transitions which predominate in hot winds in order to detect this high velocity component and to find significant differences between these models .    in spite of our assumption of optically thin line transfer ,",
    "the profiles for @xmath183 are not symmetric .",
    "this is due to the dust extinction within the hii - region .",
    "the receding material is on average further away from the observer than the approaching .",
    "the longer light paths result in stronger extinction of the redshifted components .",
    "we are aware of the fact that the neglection of scattering by dust in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rte ] ) may lead to serious errors in the calculated line profiles .",
    "we expect non - negligible contributions especially in the red - shifted parts of the lines due to light scattered by the dense , dusty surface of the neutral torus .",
    "this light was originally emitted by gas receding from the torus .",
    "the resulting redshift `` seen '' by the torus remains unchanged during the scattering process and will thus lead to enhancement of the red - shifted wings of the lines .",
    "nevertheless , we expect our qualitative results still to hold since the arguments mentioned above referring to the geometry of the underlying models are still applicable .",
    "although the cases presented here describe the situation of an intermediate mass ionizing source ( 8.4 m@xmath184 ) with a circumstellar disk , many of the basic spectral features can be generalized .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare and contrast our results with observed uchiis , even though many of the central sources are presumably much more massive .    the collections of photometry data in the catalogues of wood & churchwell  ( @xcite ) and kurtz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that the seds of almost all uchii - regions possess roughly the same structure as the ones of the models discussed here : a flat spectrum in the radio and mm regime following a @xmath185-law due to free - free emission and an ir excess originating from heated dust exceeding the free - free emission by @xmath186 orders of magnitude .",
    "a closer inspection shows that the dust temperatures are by an order of magnitude lower in most of the observed sources when compared to our models .",
    "this may be an indication that the disks are being photoionized by a close companion in a multiple system rather than the central source .",
    "alternatively , the emitting dust could be distributed in a shell swept up by the expanding hii - region and thus further away from the exciting star than for the cases discussed here .",
    "the large beam width of iras and the tendency of massive stars to form in clusters also make it likely that the ir fluxes belong to dust emission caused by more than one heating star .",
    "objects of this type would appear as `` unresolved '' in the maps presented by wood &  churchwell  ( @xcite ) for distances larger than @xmath54  300  pc .",
    "due to the cooler dust , the `` unresolved '' objects can not be explained by the models of circumstellar disks around uv luminous sources specifically discussed in this paper .",
    "certainly the cometary shaped uchiis can be explained by a disk being evaporated by the ionizing radiation of an external star and interaction with its stellar wind .",
    "numerical models dealing with this scenario will be presented in the next paper of this series .",
    "[ [ a ] ]  a ~~    a commonly accepted candidate for an evaporating disk around a young massive star is  a. its radio continuum flux obeys the @xmath147-law up to @xmath187  cm ( see collection of photometry results in thum &  martn - pintado  @xcite ) .",
    "radio maps obtained by cohen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and white &  becker  ( @xcite ) show an extended ionized bipolar outflow with a peculiar x - shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mwcvla ] ) . in the center",
    "leinert  ( @xcite ) finds an elongated , dense clump with @xmath188k , with optically thick ir emission , which makes  a one of the brightest iras sources .",
    "the elongated structure shows an almost keplerian velocity profile along its major axis , perpendicular to the outflow axis ( thum &  martn - pintado  @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the assumption of a neutral dust torus around the central star with a small outer radius @xmath189au .",
    "kelly et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated the extinction towards this early - type star to be @xmath190 .",
    "the sed of  a shows all the features which we find for our models .",
    "the extinction and the geometry of the outflow , as well as the lack of a high - velocity component in the line profiles ( hartmann et al .",
    "@xcite , hamann &  simon  @xcite ) , could be explained by a model with fast stellar wind presented in this paper , assuming a viewing angle @xmath191 . on the other hand , the high dust temperatures in the torus , @xmath192k , and the extremely high mass loss rate in the outflow , @xmath193m@xmath184yr@xmath0 ( cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ) remain puzzling and need clarification by a numerical model after the method described in this series but especially `` tailored '' to suit the needs of  a.",
    "in this paper we showed that the models of photoevaporating disks around intermediate mass stars can not explain the large number of `` unresolved '' uchii s observed by wood & churchwell  ( @xcite ) and kurtz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , because the inferred dust temperatures of these objects are in most cases an order of magnitude lower than those obtained in the numerical models . but",
    "the question remains whether the disks of more massive stars than considered here could be responsible for the high abundance of the `` unresolved '' uchii s .",
    "disks around close companions of massive stars should be treated in greater detail .",
    "if we assume that circumstellar disks are the rule in the process of star formation , the simplicity and straightforwardness of the model make it favorable compared to alternative suggestions .",
    "the extremely high radiation pressure in the vicinity of massive stars could lead to a larger distance between star and disk and thus to smaller dust temperatures .",
    "another important result of this work is that the profiles of forbidden lines in the optical for the models g2 , g3 and g4 with wind velocities of @xmath194 kms@xmath0 are almost independent of @xmath136 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mass loss rate and velocity of the evaporated disk material is not affected by its interaction with the stellar wind , but by the rate of ionizing photons and the peculiar shock structure which is very similar in the numerical models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gmodels ] ) .",
    "since the total mass loss rate is dominated by the evaporated component with low velocity , and the emission is proportional to @xmath195 , the intensity in the lines does not depend on details of the stellar wind and their profiles show the same low - velocity components .",
    "treatment of optically thick line emission and scattering effects is not possible with the method presented above . in order to compare non - lte - effects like masing lines , which are observed in various objects related with the formation of massive stars",
    ", one has to refer to different methods , e.g. the monte - carlo method presented by juvela  ( @xcite ) .",
