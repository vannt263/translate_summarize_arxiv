    "one of the key obstructions of an effective implementation of quantum algorithms is related to the ubiquitous problem of decoherence in real quantum objects @xcite .",
    "quantum decoherence is generic as it results from the imperfect isolation of the quantum system from its environment .",
    "decoherence can be diminished under very special conditions such as e.g. the presence of the decoherence free subspaces @xcite or via the application of tailored , external control schemes @xcite .",
    "a promising novel direction in quantum information relates to so called holonomic or topological quantum computations @xcite allowing for a substantial reduction of decoherence @xcite .",
    "the essence of this method consists in encoding the information in the holonomy related to the geometric phase of the quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "the geometric phase can be expressed as a path integral and via the stokes theorem , can be converted into a surface integral .",
    "therefore , it behaves like a geometric area . a quantity like an area is less dependent on the details of time evolution and therefore is less affected by changes of environmental conditions or an imperfect control , and hence , is typically more robust .",
    "this is the key attribute that makes geometric phases attractive for the implementations of fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "some suggestions have been presented to realize this objective , e.g. in nmr experiments @xcite , ion traps @xcite , neutral atoms in cavity qed @xcite , quantum dots @xcite or josephson junction devices @xcite .",
    "the performance of holonomic quantum gates under various conditions has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "the quantum evolution in the presence of decoherence is generically non  unitary .",
    "therefore , the notion of geometric phase needs to be extended .",
    "there are several extensions of the geometric phase concept for systems which are either in a mixed state or / and undergo a non  unitary evolution .",
    "the first attempt towards this goal is given in @xcite , being rather of mathematical character .",
    "the other are based on quantum trajectories @xcite , quantum interferometry @xcite and the state purification ( kinematic approach ) @xcite . for non  unitary quantum evolution",
    "there is no commonly accepted scheme of defining the geometric phase in open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "here we use the approach based on state purification as proposed in ref .",
    "this so defined geometric phase has been extensively studied in various contexts @xcite .",
    "one of the appealing advantages of studying the phase defined in @xcite is that it can be measured with a carefully prepared interferometric experiment @xcite .",
    "our reasoning is thus guided by its potential for experimental implementation .",
    "there is no unique method of describing the time evolution of open quantum systems and there are several schemes to treat such systems which however typically give rise to non - equivalent dynamics @xcite .",
    "one scheme consists in the derivation of a reduced system dynamics , via tracing over the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "except some few exactly solvable models @xcite it is not clear how to relate the reduced dynamics to the microscopically first principles dynamics based upon the hamiltonian structure of quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "the exactly solvable model of pure dephasing has been applied for studying quantum channels @xcite or in exploring the dynamics of quantum entanglement @xcite . despite its simplicity the highly non  trivial properties of geometric phase of qubits",
    "has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful examples of constructing reduced dynamics is the davies approximation scheme @xcite . within this approach , starting with the general system  bath ",
    "interaction hamiltonian , one obtains , in a mathematically rigorous way , a markovian master equation form of a quantum system weakly coupled to the environment which preserves positivity and yields the correct equilibrium gibbs state @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to various problems of statistical physics , quantum optics , solid state physics and quantum information , e. g. for studying entanglement dynamics in bipartite systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the davies master equation to study the geometric phase of the qubit coupled to the bosonic bath .",
    "various families of a coupling and different coupling strength are shown to result in a qualitative and quantitative modification of the geometric phase .",
    "this behavior could suggest a method to resolve the nature of the qubit - bath coupling : in particular , the dephasing coupling presents not only a mere theoretical construction but can be realized in experiments within tailored regimes @xcite . in order to keep this study self  contained ,",
    "we briefly review the notion of the geometric phase for a non  unitarily evolving qubit and then present the qubit master equation derived from the davies theory .",
    "generally , the time evolution of the qubit reduced density matrix @xmath0 is neither unitary nor markovian @xcite .",
    "it is constructed as the mapping @xmath1 obeying some properties depending on the specific circumstances and approximations such as e.g. the celebrated complete positivity condition @xcite . in order to exploit the approach to the geometric phase based on state purification",
    "@xcite we have to present the reduced density matrix ( [ general ] ) in the spectral - decomposition form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "we assume the initial time being @xmath10 . for the sake of completeness we sketch here , following ref .",

    "this is known as a purification of the density matrix @xmath0 in the sense that @xmath0 is a partial trace of the density matrix @xmath13 over the ancilla hilbert space . with the time evolution of the purified system one can associate the pancharatnam relative phase @xmath14 which contains both the gauge  dependent part ( a dynamical phase ) and a gauge  independent part .",
    "the central result of @xcite is to extract from eq.([panch ] ) , by a proper choice of the parallel transport condition , the purification ",
    "independent part which can be termed a geometric phase because it is gauge invariant and reduces to the known results in the limit of an unitary evolution @xcite . the final result is then given by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this phase  contrary to other attempts of extending the notion of geometric phase for a non  unitary evolving quantum system  has a direct physical meaning as it can be measured via interferometric experiments @xcite , i.e. one can construct the purification of the quantum system such that the relative phase ( [ panch ] ) reduces to the geometric phase ( [ phi ] ) after suitably defined compensating unitary cutting of the dynamical part of the relative phase @xcite .",

    "next , it decreases as @xmath74 . in comparison to the dephasing coupling , in this case we can find at least three distinguishing features of the geometric phase .",
    "firstly , we note breaking of antisymmetry of @xmath84 , being in distinct contrast to the case of pure dephasing ( @xmath93 ) , cf . fig .",
    "1 . secondly , the dependence of the phase on the initial state parameterized by @xmath59 is non - monotonic , exhibiting a local maximum and a minimum .",
    "thirdly , the geometric phase @xmath81 vanishes for @xmath94 ( i.e. for the ground state ) but not necessary so for @xmath73 ( i.e. for the excited state ) .",
    "one can observe that for a fixed @xmath25 , the dephasing process controlled by @xmath26 does not change the qualitative properties of the geometric phase @xmath81 , see figs . 1 and 3 .",
    "pure dephasing affects only the off  diagonal elements of the density matrix , becoming closer to the maximally mixed qubit state . the geometric phase in a quantum evolution of such states vanishes . in a general energy  exchanging process the time dependence of the density matrix is more complex and the geometric phase @xmath81 seemingly quantifies this fact .",
    "moreover , the stability of geometric phase with respect to decoherence is crucial for effectiveness of holonomic quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the stability of phase can be significantly improved via a proper choice of the initial state determined by @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ init1 ] ) .     on the geometric phase @xmath95 _ vs. _",
    "initial state preparation @xmath59 is depicted for a dissipative qubit with @xmath79 and zero dephasing , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in fig .",

    "secondly , the main properties remain similar : in all presented cases a minimum and a maximum exist .",
    "however , the maximum diminishes with increasing temperature .",
    "no realistic physical quantum system is in perfect isolation from its environment .",
    "at best one can achieve a weak coupling between the system and the environment . in this weak coupling regime",
    "it is possible to extract the reduced dynamics of the open quantum system in a mathematically satisfactory and controlled way by using a markovian reduced dynamics following the davies scheme . in this work",
    "we have analyzed the geometric phase of a qubit in the presence of a weak coupling to a bosonic environment .",
    "we have investigated the relation between the geometric phase @xmath81 and the mechanism for decoherence of the qubit for either the case of pure dephasing with @xmath93 or in presence of dissipative energy relaxation , i.e. @xmath80 . the latter situation allows for a significant variation of the emerging geometric phase upon varying the coupling strength @xmath25 .",
    "a variation of the pure dephasing coupling , i.e. @xmath97 with @xmath61 , between qubit and environment barely affects the geometric phase .",
    "this feature is distinct from other set - ups , such as the emergence of quantum entanglement in open systems , where this dephasing - coupling mechanism can play a dominant or a similar role as an energy relaxation - coupling .",
    "nowadays , the geometric phase plays a crucial role in a variety of physical problems and has observable consequences in a wide range of systems . under various aspects ,",
    "this concept occurs in geometry , astronomy , classical mechanics , and quantum theory .",
    "the impressive recent progress in nanotechnology and experimental techniques allows one to test the fundamentals of quantum dynamics and details of interactions modeled by hamiltonians .",
    "the geometric phase is not a quantum mechanical observable , i.e. it is not represented by a hermitian operator .",
    "however , it can be experimentally measured , cf .",
    "it can be used to encode information on systems .",
    "e.g. it has been proposed as an order parameter for quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the results obtained here suggest that one can also exploit the geometric phase as a quantifier characterizing a nature of the system - environment coupling .",
    "indeed , three features of the geometric phase @xmath69 allow one to distinguish the character of qubit - environment coupling ( i.e. pure dephasing _ vs. _",
    "dissipation ) : ( i ) rotation symmetry around some points on the @xmath98 plane or equivalently antisymmetric dependence of @xmath81 upon @xmath59 about some points , ( ii ) non - monotonic behavior of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath59 and ( iii ) the behavior of @xmath81 for @xmath73 ( i.e. for the qubit prepared in the excited state ) .",
    "we have verified that all these three features are manifest also at times @xmath99 for the measurable quantifier @xmath100 .",

    "<S> we investigate the qubit geometric phase and its properties in dependence on the mechanism for decoherence of a qubit weakly coupled to its environment . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two sources of decoherence : dephasing coupling ( without exchange of energy with environment ) and dissipative coupling ( with exchange of energy ) . reduced dynamics of the qubit is studied in terms of the rigorous davies markovian quantum master equation , both at zero and non  zero temperature . for pure dephasing coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the geometric phase varies monotonically with respect to the polar angle ( in the bloch sphere representation ) parameterizing an initial state of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is antisymmetric about some points on the geometric phase - polar angle plane . </S>",
    "<S> this is in distinct contrast to the case of dissipative coupling for which the variation of the geometric phase with respect to the polar angle typically is non - monotonic , displaying local extrema and is not antisymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity of the geometric phase to details of the decoherence source can make it a tool for testing the nature of the qubit  environment interaction . </S>"
