    "an important study to explore the star formation history and imf of young open clusters was by phelps & janes ( 1994 ) , who observed 23 open clusters in the cassiopeia region and estimated imfs for eight young clusters ( phelps & janes 1993 ) .",

    "1986 ) and sagar & richtler ( 1991 ) also made similar conclusions .",
    "high - mass stars have strong influence on their nearby surroundings and can significantly affect the formation of low mass stars .",
    "recently a relatively large number of low mass stars have been detected in a few ob associations , e.g. upper scorpios , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ori regions ( preibisch & zinnecker 1999 , dolan & mathieu 2002 ) . since this realization",
    ", surveys have demonstrated that the imfs must be essentially the same in all star forming regions ( e.g. preibisch & zinneker 1999 , hillenbrand 1997 , massey et al .",
    "the apparent difference is due mainly to the inherent low percentage of high mass stars and the incomplete survey of low mass stars in high - mass star forming regions .",

    "a few nir excess stars are visible towards the direction of the clump .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the region towards the clump a seems to be in process of emerging out from the parental cloud , so many more ysos may still be embedded in the cloud .",
    "the contribution of uibs due to pahs to the mid - infrared emissions in the four msx bands has been studied using the scheme developed by ghosh & ojha ( 2002 ) .",
    "the emission from each pixel is assumed to be a combination of two components , namely the thermal continuum from dust grains ( gray body ) and the emission from the uib features in the msx bands .",

    "the distribution is centrally dense with optical depth peak and lower temperature at the center .",
    "the region is showing cometary appearance .",
    "such a morphology can result if a massive star(s ) is formed away from the center of a molecular cloud .",
    "this will cause the hii region to expand into an asymmetric density distribution and so becomes cometary ( israel 1978 ) .",
    "from the orientation of the two emission nebulae and the arc shaped ring around the cluster center it is suggested that the central o type star(s ) is ( are ) most likely responsible for the cometary morphology and the trigger of star formation .",
    "a comparison is also made between the @xmath93 maps generated from the higher angular resolution msx maps ( fig .",
    "25 : bottom left ) and that based on the iras hires maps at 12 and 25 @xmath94 m ( fig .",
    "26 : left ) .",
    "the msx @xmath93 map is brought to the same angular resolution as of hires for the comparison .",
    "the peak optical depth is 8.54 @xmath98 for the map based on msx .",
    "the corresponding value from the iras - hires map is 1.36 @xmath98 .",
    "these derived values are in reasonable agreement considering that they are based on instruments with very different angular resolutions .",
    "the difference in the peak values of @xmath93 may be a result of the following effects : beam dilution , clumpy interstellar medium and the contribution of uib emission .",
    "in particular in our study the contribution of the uibs emission has been removed in generating the optical depth in the modeling of the mir emission from the msx bands , however the iras - hires maps represent the emission from dust and uib carriers ( e.g. the emission from the uib features falls within the iras 12 @xmath94 m band ( @xmath70 8 - 15 @xmath94 m ) ) .    the distribution of reddening ( cf . sec .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive multi - wavelength study of the star - forming region ngc 1893 to explore the effects of massive stars on low - mass star formation . using near - infrared colours , slitless spectroscopy and narrow - band @xmath0 photometry in the cluster region we have identified candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ) distributed in a pattern from the cluster to one of the nearby nebulae sim 129 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 colour - magnitude diagram of the ysos indicates that majority of these objects have ages between 1 to 5 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the spread in the ages of the ysos may indicate a non - coeval star formation in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the klf for the cluster is estimated to be @xmath2 , which agrees well with the average value ( @xmath3 ) reported for young clusters . </S>",
    "<S> for the entire observed mass range @xmath4 the value of the slope of the initial mass function , @xmath5 , comes out to be @xmath6 , which is in agreement with the salpeter value of -1.35 in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> however , the value of @xmath5 for pms phase stars ( mass range @xmath7 ) is found to be @xmath8 which is shallower than the value ( @xmath9 ) obtained for ms stars having mass range @xmath10 indicating a break in the slope of the mass function at @xmath11 . estimated </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 values indicate an effect of mass segregation for main - sequence stars , in the sense that massive stars are preferentially located towards the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated dynamical evolution time is found to be greater than the age of the cluster , therefore the observed mass segregation in the cluster may be the imprint of the star formation process . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence for triggered star formation in the region , which seems to govern initial morphology of the cluster .    </S>",
