    "classical novae are the result of a thermonuclear runaway taking place on the surface of a white dwarf and are fueled by matter accreted on to the white dwarf from a companion star .",
    "these outbursts give rise to an increase in luminosity and eject between @xmath2 of material at velocities @xmath3 @xmath4  .",
    "nova outbursts have also been detected in the gev gamma - ray regime with _ fermi gamma ray space telescope _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of gamma - rays imply that there are relativistic particles being generated in the nova event .",
    "there are two potential processes for producing gamma - rays from relativistic particles : the leptonic process and the hadronic process . in the leptonic process electrons",
    "are accelerated up to relativistic speeds , and the gamma - rays are produced when photons inverse - compton scatter off of the non - thermal electrons  @xcite . in the hadronic process",
    ", it is ions that are being accelerated to relativistic speeds ; these non - thermal protons then collide with a dense medium to produce @xmath5 mesons , which then decay to gamma - rays  .",
    "the likely source of the accelerated particles is strong shocks , which can generate relativistic particles via the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the details of particle acceleration in novae still remains a poorly understood issue , despite the potential for insight into the broader topic of high - energy astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "the first nova detected by _",
    "fermi _ was v407 cyg , and it received considerable attention  . given that v407 cyg has a mira giant secondary with a dense wind ( a member of the symbiotic class of systems ) , a model to explain the gamma - rays was proposed wherein a shock was generated as the nova ejecta interacted with the dense ambient medium .",
    "this model , however , failed to explain subsequent novae detected by _",
    "fermi _ : v1324 sco , v959 mon , v339 del  @xcite , v1369 cen  @xcite , and v5668 sgr  @xcite , almost all of which do not have a detectable red - giant companion ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ; the progenitor of v5589 sgr has yet to be determined ) .",
    "while it is theoretically possible for these novae to have high density circumstellar material despite not having a red - giant companion  @xcite , no evidence has yet been found for dusty circumstellar material around cataclysmic variables  @xcite .",
    "thus the fact that red - giant companions were not detected implies that these novae have main - sequence companions with low - density circumstellar material .",
    "it is in fact much more likely that the shocks are being produced within the ejecta , due to different components of the ejecta colliding with one another ( internal shocks ) .",
    "there has already been long standing evidence for internal shocks in classical novae from x - ray observations  @xcite . however , some asymmetry in the mass ejection mechanism is necessary in order to generate internal shocks .",
    "one idea put forward by  @xcite is that there is a common envelope phase during the mass ejection , resulting in a density enhancement in the binary orbital plane .",
    "a separate , fast , and diffuse wind propagates in the polar direction ( e.g. perpendicular to the orbital plane ) . when these two outflows  dense equatorial and diffuse polar ",
    "collide with one another , they produce shocks .",
    "progress has been made on the theoretical front , by constraining the conditions necessary for both the thermal emission  @xcite and non - thermal emission  @xcite observed in gamma - ray detected novae .",
    "work done in  @xcite found that a significant fraction ( @xmath6 ) of the bolometric light should be coming from shock emission .",
    "however , there has been little in the way of in - depth , multi - wavelength , analysis of these gamma - ray novae on the observational side , to constrain the properties of the shock .",
    "it is critical that a multi - wavelength analysis is used , as each of the different spectral regimes provides a different piece of the puzzle . from the x - rays we can constrain the shock environment ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ; from the optical and",
    "ir we gain information about the energetics and structure of the ejecta ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; from the radio , we can determine bulk ejecta properties such as mass and velocity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we must also construct a model that can produce non - thermal particle acceleration , to facilitate gamma - ray production .",
    "it is only possible to disentangle the complexity of nova events by leveraging the information gained from each wavelength regime .",
    "here we present the first such multi - wavelength analysis of the most gamma - ray luminous nova , v1324 sco .",
    "we present the results from our analysis of v1324 sco using data from the optical / near - ir , radio , and x - ray ( limits ) .",
    "this paper begins by presenting the complete multi - wavelength dataset we have gathered for v1324 sco : in section  [ sec : opticalphotometry ] we discuss the optical / near - ir photometry ; in section  [ sec : opticalspectra ] we discuss the optical spectra ; in section  [ sec : xray ] we detail the x - ray limits ; and in section  [ sec : radiosection ] we discuss our radio data . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we show that v1324 sco is  in all non - gamma - ray observations  a normal nova ; we discuss how a normal nova can also be the most luminous gamma - ray nova observed to date ; we present a model that explains this seemingly paradoxical situation ; and we also present a means of testing said model .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] by summarizing our findings for v1324 sco and lessons learned for future observations of gamma - ray novae .",

    "it should be noted that , during the dust event , we expect some fraction of the nova ejecta to cool , recombine , and become neutral .",
    "since neutral particles wo nt emit free - free emission  or , at least for atoms with significant dipole moments , they will emit significantly less free - free emission than ionized particles ",
    "we do nt expect this mass to show up in the radio emission .",
    "however , we know from previous studies ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references within ) that the dust mass usually makes up no more than @xmath214 of the total ejecta mass , so this discrepancy is negligible .    from the physical properties of the nova event derived above we find that v1324 sco is very typical ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .      in the x - ray regime , again , v1324 sco is normal for a _ d _ class nova .",
    "although the three novae we were previously using as examples all went into outburst before there was consistent x - ray monitoring of novae , we know from more recent _ d _ class novae that it is the norm  rather than the exception  for dusty novae to go undetected in x - rays .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , only one _ d _ class nova has been detected in hard x - rays : v1280 sco , although this detection was @xmath215 days after the beginning of the nova event .",
    "note : although not considered a _ d _ class nova ,  @xcite makes the case that v2362 cyg is another dusty nova that has been x - ray detected .",
    "a further two marginally dusty novae have been detected as super - soft - sources ( v2467 cyg and v574 pup , see  @xcite and references within ) .",
    "note that these two sources showed little to no change in their optical light ; the presence of dust was only determined due to a modest increase in ir flux . on the other hand , six other dusty novae  including v1324 sco  were observed but not detected in x - rays ( v1324 sco , v2676 oph , v2361 cyg , v1065 cen , v2615 oph , and v5579 sgr ; again , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this lack of x - ray emission in dusty novae could be explained by the cool dense dust forming material absorbing the majority of the x - rays before they can escape .",
    "we find that , based on the x - ray observations , v1324 sco is still a normal nova .",
    "a luminous red nova ( lrn ) , observationally , appear brighter and with redder colors than a classical nova ( see , e.g. ,  ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of these observational characteristics is that a lrn is the result of a merger of a close binary .",
    "v1309 sco is one of the canonical lrns , and its optical emission is very similar to v1324 sco .",
    "both have an initial , slow , monotonic rise , both have a flattening of the optical light curve near peak , and both have a significant dust event .",
    "we find , however , that a luminous red nova does not fit with the observations of v1324 sco .",
    "specifically ,    @xmath216 the most generous estimate of the ejecta mass is still two orders of magnitude smaller than what is expected for lrn events ,  @xcite .",
    "@xmath216 there is still a detectable period during the power law decline phase of the light curve .",
    "this was determined using the moa data set , which had the best sampling , as well as the highest cadence .",
    "the period was measured using the lomb - scargle algorithm in the python scientific library _",
    "scipy_. we limited the data set to @xmath217 detections .",
    "some facets of the lrn model , however , could explain features seen in v1324 sco .",
    "for instance , in v1309 sco , the physical explanation for the light - curve flattening near maximum is that the photosphere does not grow  or grows very slowly  in eulerian coordinates ( and is shrinking in lagrangian coordinates ) , due to the fact that the ejecta envelope is cooling , recombining , and becoming optically thin very rapidly .",
    "this could also explain the flattening of the optical light curve in v1324 sco .",
    "another connection is that the early - slow rise phase of v1309 sco ( see  ) is somewhat similar to that in the rise seen in v1324 sco . in v1309",
    "sco the rise was interpreted by  @xcite as being due to mass loss from l2 .",
    "likewise ,  @xcite interprets the  initial \" ejecta phase as being due to a `` common - envelope '' like ejection , which very well could manifest in its early stage also as l2 mass loss .",
    "having established in the previous section that v1324 sco is  in all non gamma - ray observations  a normal nova , we now discuss what about this nova could cause it to have such an extremely high gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "there is extremely strong observational evidence for a shock interaction , both from the gamma - rays and from the radio .",
    "we discuss here the observational evidence tied to the shock , as well as the physical properties of the nova event ",
    "velocity , density , etc.that could give rise to differences the in gamma - ray luminosity .",

    "bottom panel : evolution of the velocities of both h@xmath95 and h@xmath124 .",
    "both velocities are found by taking the half - width at half maximum hwhm of the spectral feature .",
    "the gray shaded region indicates the period of gamma - ray emission  @xcite .",
    "this increase in velocity  coincident with the gamma - ray emission  is interpreted as being a signature of the shock interaction . ]      looking at figure  [ fig : halphaevol ] it is clear that the inferred balmer line velocities change as a function of time .",
    "the spectroscopic velocities for h@xmath95 and h@xmath124 are plotted in figure  [ fig : balmerlinevelocities ] , along with the photometric light curve for comparison purposes .",
    "all velocities quoted are half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) measured for each line .",
    "a number of the spectra taken by walter were either blue ( @xmath218 ) or red ( @xmath219 ) ; given that h@xmath95 and h@xmath124 were were consistently strong in all the spectrum we analyzed , we chose to use these two features for our measurements in order to maximize the number of velocity measurements .",
    "the hwhm was measured by fitting a gaussian profile to the emission lines using the iraf routine _",
    "splot_. the uncertainties were found by adding in quadrature both the uncertainty in the line measurement  found by measuring the line multiple times in _",
    "splot_and the ( average ) dispersion of the spectrum .",
    "note that the velocity rises approximately concurrent with the gamma - ray emission ( day @xmath220 to @xmath146 , marked as a grey shaded region in figure  [ fig : balmerlinevelocities ] ) .",
    "there are three potential explanations for the observed increase in the balmer line radial velocity .",
    "@xmath216 an increase in the ejecta speed .",
    "this is what is usually thought to be the case in novae when an increase in doppler velocity is observed  @xcite .",
    "the best argument against this interpretation is that  along with the increase in velocity  we also see a change in the structure of the spectral profile .",
    "specifically , we see a double horned profile that is characteristic of bipolar ejected material ( see figure  [ fig : balmerlinevelocities ] , between days @xmath221 to @xmath222 ) .",
    "@xmath216 a recombination wave passing through the outer envelope of the ejecta .",
    "this type of model has been proposed to explain flattening of the optical light curves observed in sne - ii p and luminous red novae , wherein expansion cools the ejecta to the point where hydrogen recombines ( see section  [ sec : luminousrednova ] for further details ) .",
    "the now neutral hydrogen can no longer radiate via free - free emission .",
    "this process is referred to as a recombination wave , and it would have a significant effect on the structure of the emission lines .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that a recombination wave is causing the changes in the balmer emission lines .",
    "however , it is unclear if this would necessarily increase the line velocity or just change the shape of the line profile .",
    "@xmath216 a different , faster , ejecta component_behind _ the previously observed h@xmath95 emitting region ",
    "slams into the previously observed slower region of material , becoming visible .",
    "we find this to be the most likely explanation , as it can explain both the increase in velocity and change in shape of the spectral feature .",
    "it should be noted that this derivation of the velocity is an oversimplification .",
    "it is well known that there are multiple velocity components in novae spectra that need to be disentangled ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it does serve to put at least some kind of bound on the velocities .",
    "the initial radio bump  seen in figure  [ fig : radiolc ] starting on day @xmath158 and going until day @xmath223is a strong indicator of a shock .",
    "the bump was too early to be the thermal emission normally seen in novae . to illustrate the non - thermal nature of the initial radio bump we can use the brightness temperature , which is a the temperature necessary for the observed flux to be purely thermal ( assuming some distance and velocity ) .",
    "the equation for brightness temperature is given by @xmath224 where @xmath194 is the observed flux , @xmath186 is the distance , @xmath225 is the time , and @xmath226 is a fiducial ejecta velocity .",
    "we use the brightness temperature as a measure of the deviation from what we would expect from a thermally emitting gas at @xmath204 k. figure  [ fig : brightnesstemperature ] shows the maximum brightness temperature as a function of time ( using the distance lower limit of @xmath227 kpc from  @xcite and a velocity of 1,000 km s@xmath97 ) .",
    "note that two observation epochs ( days @xmath228 and @xmath229 ) were removed due to the lack of low - frequency observations , which usually set the maximum brightness temperature .",
    "the early time radio bump ( day @xmath160 to @xmath161 ) has maximum brightness temperatures far exceeding that of the canonical @xmath204 k thermally emitting ejecta  which can be seen as the dashed black line .",
    "the first radio observation , on day @xmath158 , occurred while the source was still gamma - ray bright .",
    "note that the observation epochs taken on days @xmath230 and @xmath229 were omitted due to a lack of low - frequency observations . ]",
    "this type of initial radio bump has been seen in several other nova , including qu vul  , v1723 aql  @xcite , and v5589 sgr  @xcite and we are beginning to develop theories to explain such behavior . in  ,  @xcite , and  @xcite it is postulated that the initial radio bumps could be thermal free - free or synchrotron emission  although  @xcite come down strongly in favor of the non - thermal model .    to get such high thermal emission at early times , both and  @xcite invoke a strong shock as a means for generating hot , free - free emitting gas .",
    "such high temperature gas would also produce significant x - ray emission , which was not observed in v1324 sco .",
    "this can be explained if there is a high column density of material adjacent to the x - ray emitting region ( see section  [ sec : xray ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , and  @xcite acknowledge that the emission could be coming from synchrotron emission . in the case of qu vul ,",
    "invoke the razin - tsytovich effect to explain the high spectral - index ( @xmath231 ) during the initial radio bump .",
    "@xcite find that you can also achieve a spectral index @xmath232 when you account for the fact that the expanding ejecta are not isothermal , but have some temperature structure .",
    "this is not needed in the case of v1324 sco , as the spectral index remains at or below 2 throughout the entire initial radio bump .",
    "@xcite found that , for low - velocity shocks ( @xmath233 ) , line emission dominates the cooling and is very efficient , driving the gas temperature to @xmath234 k. this makes it very difficult to achieve the @xmath235 k gas necessary for the initial radio emission to be explained by thermal emission .",
    "the radio data favor a shock velocity @xmath236 , as we show in section  [ sec : radiofitting ] .",
    "this means that the shock is likely very radiatively efficient , making the thermal emission model for the early radio bump less likely than the non - thermal emission model .      in order to determine what could cause the extreme gamma - ray luminosity , we first determine  in an analytical fashion",
    " the physical quantities that affect the gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "we present here a very simplified model of the ejecta that can explain the gamma - ray emission .",
    "we can imagine the ejecta as being composed of two parts : a slow initial component and a fast secondary component .",
    "when these two components meet , there will be both a forward and reverse shock , and it is these shocks that will power the gamma - ray emission .",
    "we further assume that these shocks are radiative , so we expect there to be a layer of cold material between the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "most of this analysis is based on the models of  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that the slow component has a density profile given by @xmath237,\\ ] ] where @xmath238 is the slow component mass loss rate , @xmath239 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath240 is the solid angle fraction that is subtended by the slow component , @xmath241 is the velocity of the slow component , and @xmath242 is the radius of the slow component ( @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is the time since the slow component was ejected ) .",
    "likewise , the fast component has a density profile given by @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the fast component mass loss rate , @xmath247 is the velocity of the fast component .    assuming that the shocks are radiative",
    ", there will be a cold layer of material between the forward and reverse shocks ( note that this is also the region where dust will eventually form  @xcite ) .",
    "we will denote the mass of this shell as @xmath248 , which grows in time as @xmath249 while the momentum grows as @xmath250 a steady state solution ( i.e. @xmath251 ) will be reached quickly , wherein the cool shell reaches a final `` terminal '' velocity . to make this problem more tractable , we assume that @xmath252 and @xmath253 . in this limit",
    "we find that @xmath254    the power dissipated by the shocks is determined by the number of thermal particles swept up by the shock , which can be expressed as @xmath255 since usually @xmath256 , the shock power will be dominated by the reverse shock ,    @xmath257    to determine the amount of time that the gamma - ray emission will persist",
    " hereafter referred to as @xmath258we need to find the amount of time it will take for the shock to cross the initial slow component , i.e. @xmath259 . rewriting this using our expression for the shock velocity , we find @xmath260 in the case where @xmath261 ( where @xmath244 is the amount of time since the slow initial component was ejected ) . in such a situation @xmath258 can be simplified to @xmath262 we can see that increasing either @xmath246 or @xmath247 will increase @xmath263 while decreasing @xmath258 .",
    "this inverse relationship between the gamma - ray luminosity and the duration of the gamma - ray emission has been observed by  @xcite .",
    "we posit that it is the fast secondary component that is key in determining the total gamma - ray luminosity , and it is this component that made v1324 sco the most gamma - ray luminous nova detected to date .",
    "it is unclear whether it is the fast component s velocity , mass , or a combination of the two that sets v1324 sco apart from the other gamma - ray detected novae .",
    "this theory can be tested by comparing both the velocity evolution of the ejecta ( similar to the analysis of section  [ sec : velocityvariations ] ) and ejecta mass ( similar to the analysis of section  [ sec : radiofitting ] ) for multiple gamma - ray detected novae .",
    "we present here multi - wavelength observations for the most gamma - ray luminous classical nova , v1324 sco .",
    "we demonstrated that this nova was , in all non - gamma - ray observations , a normal nova .",
    "taking a closer look at this normal nova , though , we also see strong evidence for powerful and complex shocks .    using the optical photometry and spectra we were able to classify v1324 sco as a @xmath186 ( dusty ) photometric class and an fe ii spectral class nova , both of which are common among classical novae . by fitting the evolution of the thermal radio emission we derived a relatively normal ejecta mass of @xmath1and a similarly normal ejecta velocity @xmath0 .    in spite of this seeming normalcy ,",
    "we also see strong evidence for shocks , including gamma - ray emission , early time velocity variations coincident with the gamma - ray emission , and early time non - thermal radio emission .",
    "to explain this , we presented a simple model that invokes an ejecta composed of two components : an initial slow component , and a fast secondary component . using this model , we find that the likely key variables for setting the gamma - ray luminosity are the mass loss rate and velocity of the fast secondary ejecta component .",
    "this theory can be put to the test by comparing the velocity variations and ejecta mass of v1324 sco to other gamma - ray detected novae .",

    "the o i line at 6300    can also be used as a density diagnostic .",

    "we can also calculate the total mass that this density implies . assuming a velocity of @xmath314 @xmath4 , a mean molecular weight of @xmath315 grams / particle , and a uniform density",
    ", this density would correspond to a total ejecta mass of @xmath316 ; such a high ejecta mass is at odds with the mass derived from the radio light curve ( discussed in section  [ sec : radiofitting ] ) .",
    "a plausible resolution to this discrepancy is if the line emitting region is the cooling region behind a radiative shock , where we would expect the density to be substantially higher  @xcite .",
