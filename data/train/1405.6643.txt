    "the search for particles beyond the standard model ( sm ) is one of the key issues of the atlas and cms experiments at lhc . in particular",
    ", these experiments can test the theories with extra dimensions , which aim to solve the hierarchy problem by bringing the gravity scale closer to the electroweak scale ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . over",
    "a decade ago , arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite proposed a scenario whereby the sm is constrained to the common 3 + 1 space - time dimensions ( brane ) , while the gravity is free to propagate throughout a larger multidimensional space ( bulk ) . in this large extra dimensions ( led ) scenario , @xmath3 extra spatial dimensions are compactified on a torus with common circumference @xmath4 .",
    "then the four dimensional planck scale @xmath5 is no longer the relevant scale but is related to the fundamental scale @xmath6 as follows @xmath7 where @xmath6 is @xmath8(tev ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9 dimensional graviton corresponds to a tower of massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes in four dimensions .",
    "the interactions of these spin-2 kk gravitons with the sm matter can be described by an effective theory with the lagrangian given by  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , the massive kk gravitons are labelled by a @xmath12-dimensional vector of positive integers and @xmath13 denotes the energy - momentum tensor of the sm . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath14 the feynman rules that follow from eq .",
    "( [ lagrangiano ] ) can be found in refs .",
    "the individual kk resonances have masses equal to @xmath15 and thus the mass gap between the neighbouring modes @xmath16 is small for @xmath3 not too large , which allow us to approximate the discrete mass spectrum by a continuum .",
    "the individual kk mode couples with a strength @xmath17 to the sm fields .",
    "however , since there are many kk modes , the total coupling strength is of the order of @xmath18 after summing up all of them .",
    "moreover , the excited gravitons preferentially decay into two gauge bosons rather than into two leptons , because the graviton has spin 2 , and so fermions can not be produced in an @xmath19 wave .",
    "searches for the large extra dimensions scenario via virtual - graviton effects were performed at hera , lep , the tevatron , and the lhc ( for a recent review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent experimental results from the atlas and cms collaborations sets lower limits on @xmath6 , being about 3.5 tev ( 2.7 tev ) for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) @xcite . from the theoretical side , many studies on the virtual kk graviton effects up to the nlo exist  @xcite .",
    "these include the processes of fermion - pair , multijet , and diboson production .",
    "in general the contribution associated to the graviton exchange is mostly undetectable because of the much larger standard model background .",
    "the lower sm background occurs in the production of @xmath0 pairs which have the smallest cross section of all the diboson processes .",
    "in contrast , this process have tree - level contributions in the led scenario , which motivated the study of the @xmath0 boson pair production mediated by the kaluza - klein graviton in large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "these studies consider inclusive processes , where the hadrons colliding dissociate after the interaction . in this paper",
    "we extend these previous studies for _ diffractive _ processes , in which the hadrons colliding lose only a small fraction of their initial energy and escape the central detectors  @xcite . in the diffractive interaction",
    "the hadron can dissociate ( inclusive diffractive process ) or remain intact ( exclusive diffractive process ) . in what follows",
    "we consider the @xmath0 boson pair production in central exclusive processes ( cep ) , @xmath22 , which are characterized by empty regions in pseudo - rapidity , called rapidity gaps ( denoted by @xmath23 ) , that separate the intact very forward hadron from the @xmath24 final state produced in the interaction [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] . exclusivity means that nothing else is produced except the leading hadrons and the central object .",
    "moreover , we consider central inclusive processes ( cip ) , @xmath25 , which also exhibit rapidity gaps but the incident hadrons dissociates in the products @xmath26 and @xmath27 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] . in general the rapidity gaps present in inclusive processes",
    "are smaller than in the exclusive case .",
    "a qcd mechanism for the central inclusive and exclusive diffractive production of a heavy central system has been proposed by khoze , martin and ryskin  @xcite , denoted durham model hereafter , with its predictions in broad agreement with the observed rates measured by cdf collaboration  @xcite ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "the durham model is applied , for the first time , for the @xmath0 boson pair production considering the kk graviton exchange .",
    "our main motivation is associated to the fact that in the standard model the @xmath0 boson pair is not produced at leading order by the gluon fusion .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 boson pair can not be produced at leading order in diffractive processes . at next - to - leading - order the @xmath28 subprocess via the quark loop contributes @xcite .",
    "however , as will be demonstrated below for the case of central inclusive processes , the resulting cross section is one order of magnitude smaller than the led prediction .",
    "it implies a very low qcd background , making its observation a signature of large extra dimensions .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]        @xmath2 ( @xmath29{tev}$ ] ) & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + @xmath32 ( @xmath33{tev}$ ] ) & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + & @xmath36 & 0.02 + @xmath37 ( @xmath38{tev}$ ] ) & @xmath39 & @xmath40 +    finally , now we compute the production rates for lhc energies considering the distinct mechanisms .",
    "we assume @xmath41 , @xmath42{tev}$ ] and @xmath43 = 2 .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tabzz ] . at lhc",
    "we assume the design luminosities @xmath44{mb^{-1}s^{-1}}$ ] for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath45{tev}$ ] and a run time of @xmath46{s}$ ] for collisions with protons ( ions ) .",
    "moreover , we also consider the upgraded @xmath32 scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which analyse a potential path to improve the @xmath32 luminosity and the running time .",
    "these authors proposed the following scenario for @xmath32 collisions : @xmath47{mb^{-1}s^{-1}}$ ] and a run time of @xmath48{s}$ ] .",
    "the corresponding event rates are presented in the third line of the table  [ tabzz ] .",
    "our results indicate that for the default settings and running times , the statistics are marginal for @xmath37 collisions . consequently , the possibility to carry out a measurement of the double @xmath0 production in diffractive interactions is virtually null in these collisions . on the other hand , in @xmath2 collisions the event rates for the central inclusive production predicted by",
    "the led scenario is reasonable , with the sm background being one order of magnitude smaller . in comparison to the results for the inclusive double @xmath0 production presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and ref .",
    "@xcite , our predictions for diffractive production are a factor @xmath49 smaller . despite their much smaller cross sections ,",
    "the clean topology of the diffractive production implies a larger signal to background ratio . therefore , the experimental detection is in principle feasible .",
    "however , the signal is expected to be reduced due to the event pileup which eliminates one of the main advantages of the diffractive processes .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath50 collisions it is expected to trigger on and carry out the measurement with almost no pileup  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the upgraded @xmath50 scenario also provides one possibility to detect the double @xmath0 production in central inclusive processes .",
    "the search for new physics at the tev - scale is one of the major tasks for the current and future high - energy physics experiments . in particular , models with extra spatial dimensions and tev scale gravity",
    "are expected to provide a plethora of new and interesting signals . in this paper the double @xmath0 production in diffractive processes was considered for the first time . as in the standard model",
    "the @xmath0 boson pair is not produced at leading order by the gluon fusion , this final state can not be produced at leading order in diffractive processes , which implies that a very low qcd background is expected .",
    "we have estimated the cross sections and event rates for the double @xmath0 production in central exclusive and central inclusive processes considering @xmath1 collisions .",
    "both processes are characterized by the presence of two rapidity gaps in the final state , differing by the dissociation or not of the incident hadrons .",
    "our results indicate that the led predictions for the central inclusive production are larger than the sm one and that the experimental analysis of this process in @xmath2 collisions is feasible at cern lhc .",
    "this conclusion motivates a more detailed analysis of the gap survival probability for the double @xmath0 production , which is one of the main sources of uncertainty in our calculations , as well as to implement our calculations in a monte carlo simulation for diffractive processes .",
    "both subjects will be addressed in the future .",
