    "smart grid concepts are being developed to cope with the turbulent nature of wind power , that involve e.g. energy storage or smart control strategies .",
    "the challenge is on the one hand technical , as the current grid structure must evolve from a strongly polarized source / load configuration with few large power sources towards a delocalized distribution of small renewable sources @xcite .",
    "new grid concepts must be designed to handle the increasing amount of fluctuating wind power , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an example on active wind power regulation . on the other hand ,",
    "a fundamental understanding of the wind resource still lacks .",
    "wind energy planing still focuses mostly on large - scale meteorological wind dynamics .",
    "dynamics at faster time scales in minutes are typically simplified to a gaussian wind field @xcite , bypassing the complex dynamics of turbulence @xcite .",
    "yet it is observed on measured data that fast wind fluctuations deviate from gaussianity @xcite , and are instead intermittent multifractals @xcite .",
    "this observation must be coupled with the fact that modern wind turbine designs optimize power performance @xcite by following these fast , intermittent wind fluctuations . besides the obvious impact on the mechanical loads acting on the turbine machinery @xcite",
    ", such performance - oriented control strategy implies feeding intermittent gusts into the power grid @xcite .",
    "our increasing dependence on wind energy stresses the necessity to reliably predict first the wind dynamics , and second the resulting wind power production .",
    "the first aspect is a fundamental challenge that traditionally involves both fields of meteorology for large - scale dynamics and turbulence for fast fluctuations .",
    "the central problem is that wind dynamics involve a wide range of spatio - temporal scales that are entangled in an energy cascade .",
    "the standard picture involves a three - dimensional downward cascade at small scales and a two - dimensional inverse cascade at mesoscales . in between , a hypothetical spectral gap @xcite would separate the two regimes .",
    "some recent studies contradict this hypothesis and propose a universal cascade model instead @xcite . besides solving directly navier - stokes equation including all external influences such as thermal transfers or topography ( that is far from achievable ) ,",
    "no simpler alternative is recognized as a valid method to describe the entire wind dynamics .",
    "instead various meteorological models parametrize all the influencing effects , but they are limited in their resolution due to their high computational cost , nowadays resolving spatial and temporal scales of typically @xmath5 km@xmath6 and @xmath5 hour . the smaller structures ( that remain quite large ) are usually not modeled using cfd , but with a statistical model of turbulence , e.g. a gaussian correlated field @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that high - frequency wind models have been developed for decades @xcite , and the turbulence community has proposed several approaches in recent years @xcite .    the second aspect consists in modeling the conversion process operated by the wind installation , seen here as the conversion of a wind speed @xmath7 conditioned on the wind direction @xmath8 into an electrical power output @xmath9 .",
    "the complete conversion process is commonly simplified to an average power curve @xcite in the case of a single wind turbine .",
    "being an average curve , this approach is a good description of the long - term behavior , but naturally fails to describe the dynamics in the faster time scales of minutes @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a prediction model for the low - frequency ( 30-minute ) trend of a wind farm power output from weather data using a mixed statistical / cfd approach .",
    "it has been recently shown that the cumulative power output of a wind farm @xcite or a 300-km large wind installation @xcite contain intermittent fluctuations at time scales of minutes and even seconds that are typical of a multifractal process .",
    "the standard power curve method overlooks such effects , so it is impossible to predict precisely how stable the power grid will be at the short time scales at which it is operated .    for the optimal exploitation of wind energy , it is also important to minimize downtimes",
    ". servicing and spare parts were found to account for one fourth of operation and maintenance costs for onshore installations , i.e. about @xmath10 of the total investment @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a 15-year - long study and showed that the 1500 onshore wind turbines studied had an average availability of @xmath11 ( downtimes occurred during @xmath12 of the time ) .",
    "about half of the recorded failures were attributed to electrical and control systems , the other half coming from mechanical systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that failure rates were especially high for wind turbines of 1mw and more .",
    "recent results @xcite show that the availability of offshore installations is much lower , in the order of @xmath13 .",
    "this makes the development of procedures for early warning , identification and reparation of damages essential , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview of various detection methods .",
    "in particular , methods for the early prediction of emerging failures are very valuable in order to react optimally .",
    "there are strong indications that the turbulent nature of wind flows affects the mechanical fatigue of wind turbines @xcite .",
    "this underlines the necessity to include the fast dynamics of turbulence in wind energy methods in order to further improve the reliability of wind energy systems .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative approach that describes and remodels the conversion process of a wind farm at a frequency of @xmath5 hz .",
    "our analysis is performed on a wind farm that is described in section [ sec : wf ] .",
    "we present a stochastic model for the conversion process in section [ sec : model ] , where the dynamics are intuitively characterized through a set of stochastic estimates .",
    "we show in section [ sec : monitor ] that these estimates are highly reactive to dynamical changes , and we promote them as well for condition monitoring of the power performance for a wind farm .",
    "also , a probabilistic description of the power production is presented in appendix [ sec : proba ] .",
    "all results presented in this paper were extracted from measurement data for one wind farm . the wind farm is installed onshore over an area covering roughly @xmath14 , and is surrounded by flat rural terrain .",
    "it consists of 12 identical variable - speed , pitch - regulated wind turbines .",
    "the rated power of each turbine is in the order of @xmath15mw .",
    "its exact value can not be published following an agreement with the farm manager .",
    "for this reason , all values of power output will be normalized to the rated power of the entire wind farm @xmath16mw .",
    "measurements were conducted synchronously at each wind turbine .",
    "the measured signals are the net electrical power output generated by each wind turbine , and the wind speed and direction measured on each nacelle by a cup anemometer and a wind vane .",
    "the operational status of each wind turbine was also provided , so that the data was rejected when one or more turbines were not operating in normal conditions .",

    "some new observables were defined from the data measured on all single wind turbines . ref .",
    "@xcite observes that the average of all single wind speed and direction measurements is a more precise measure for power curve modeling than an eventual met mast measurement .",
    "following this observation , we define three observables for the wind farm .",
    "the average wind speed over the entire wind farm is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wind speed measured at @xmath5hz by the cup anemometer on the nacelle of turbine @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , the average wind direction over the entire wind farm is defined following @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wind direction measured at @xmath5hz by the wind vane on the nacelle of turbine @xmath25 . finally , the total power output fed by the wind farm into the electric grid is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the net electrical power output of turbine @xmath25 at @xmath5hz .",

    "the ten - minute analysis gives a coarse picture of the wind farm dynamics .",
    "within each ten - minute time period , the average wind speed @xmath34 is calculated from the 600 samples @xmath0 following @xmath35 similarly , the ten - minute average wind direction @xmath1 and power output @xmath36 are calculated from @xmath33 and @xmath2 .",

    "this is an indication that averaging over all turbine anemometers following equation ( [ eq : u ] ) conserves the wind speed histogram .",
    "the histogram of power output shows that power values below @xmath37 are most probable , and that the probability of measuring a higher power value decays rapidly .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that power values up to @xmath38 of the farm rated power are measured , in which case all turbines deliver slightly above their rated power .     with a resolution @xmath39 % .",

    "we define the iec - like power curve for the wind farm by adapting the norm iec 61400 - 12 - 1 @xcite originally designed for a single wind turbine . for each wind sector @xmath41 of size @xmath43 ,",
    "we sort the ten - minute averages of wind speed @xmath34 and power output @xmath36 .",
    "we then average the ten - minute averages in each wind speed bin @xmath44 of size @xmath45 m / s .",
    "this yields an iec power curve @xmath46 for each wind sector , as presented in figure [ fig : iec_sectors ] .",
    "the power curves look similar to the typical iec power curve of a wind turbine @xcite . a cut - in wind speed is found at around @xmath47 m / s , and the rated farm power is reached at roughly @xmath48 m / s , as specified for the single wind turbines in the farm . we observe some deviations in power performance of up to @xmath49 depending on the wind direction .",
    "this is due to the various wake effects ( reduced wind speed and power downstream of wind turbines ) that change with the inflow direction .",
    "this implies that the global performance of the farm depends on the inflow direction , and modeling or monitoring applications must be direction - dependent .     with corresponding error bars for the wind sectors @xmath50 . ]     with corresponding error bars for the wind sectors @xmath50 . ]",
    "we focus in this paper on wind farm dynamics at @xmath5hz .",

    "the effective wind speed @xmath0 and power output @xmath2 display fast fluctuations at @xmath5hz .",
    "while the ten - minute averages @xmath34 and @xmath36 give a rough estimate , the actual dynamics of the wind farm happen on a faster time scale .",
    "the wind farm filters the fastest wind fluctuations in time scales of few seconds due to its inertia . however , wind speed changes happening within seconds and minutes are converted into power output changes .",
    "the high frequency data also shows wind gusts that are underestimated by ten - minute averages .",
    "it is the case in figure [ fig : series8b ] e.g. at time @xmath51 min @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath52 @xmath54 min , where the wind speed @xmath0 drops by @xmath55 m/s ( while @xmath34 only drops by @xmath15 m/s ) . in the same time , the power output @xmath2 drops by @xmath56 ( while @xmath36 only drops by @xmath57 ) .",
    "this indicates first that rapid and large changes are measured for the wind speed and power output , and second that ten - minutes averages obviously underestimate the amplitude of these rapid changes .",
    "the @xmath58 space is common for power curve methods because it is the phase space representing the input / output variables @xmath59 for a wind turbine .",
    "we use this representation for the wind farm in figure [ fig : up_1hz ] .",
    "the fast 1hz data fluctuates around the iec power curve with deviations in power output of up to @xmath60 .",
    "this shows that large errors up to @xmath37 can be generated by using an iec power curve for power estimation / modeling .",
    "the 2h sample shown in figure [ fig : series8b ] is overlaid in figure [ fig : up_1hz ] , illustrating the volatility of the conversion process .",

    "the four anomalies cover different time periods , such that each scenario affects the power performance at different locations in the @xmath65 space .",

    "is compared to the power output measured ( gray line in background ) .",
    "the period of the anomaly is marked by the gray area ( except for ( c ) where the anomaly happens intermittently all over the 14-day period ) . ]",
    "we compare in figure [ fig : compare_monitoring_iec ] the impact of each anomaly on the ten - minute means of power output @xmath36 and on the corresponding iec power curve @xmath67 .",
    "we observe that for scenario ( a ) , most ten - minute means lie around the power curve of the normal case , and the resulting iec power curve in figure [ fig : compare_monitoring_iec](a2 ) does not deviate noticeably from the normal case .",
    "the anomaly only lasts @xmath68 of the total time , which is not enough for the iec procedure to detect it . for scenario ( b ) , enough ten - minute means deviate from the normal power curve , such that the iec power curve is changed significantly by a step - like structure at wind speeds higher than @xmath69 m / s .",
    "we found that this is the minimal anomaly duration , i.e. @xmath70 of the time for the iec method to detect an anomaly . in scenario ( c )",
    ", the anomaly also lasts 4 days but intermittently . in this case",
    "the ten - minute means deviate only slightly from the normal case , and no outliers are observed .",
    "the resulting iec power curve does deviate slightly from the normal case , but less so than for the equally long but uninterrupted anomaly in scenario ( b ) .",
    "this is expected from a ten - minute averaging that mixes 9 minutes of normal operation with 1 minute of anomaly .",

    "it is a good candidate to detect fine changes in the farm dynamics .",
    "additionally , its potential @xmath73 gives a more intuitive representation of the attractors of the system , that define the langevin power curve @xmath74 .",
    "we compare the impact of each scenario on the drift coefficient , potential and langevin power curve in figure [ fig : compare_monitoring_drift ] .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : drift_potential ] , the measured normal case ( full gray line ) corresponds to a linear drift towards the langevin power value .",
    "the extreme case of a full anomaly ( dashed gray line ) also displays a fairly linear drift towards a new , reduced power value .",
    "shutting down some turbines reduces the power production , and the farm naturally drifts towards a lower power value .",
    "in the four scenarios , the normal and anomaly situations coexist , and the drift coefficient systematically records these two states .",
    "the anomaly duration acts as a weighting factor that determines how much the drift is distorted close to the reduced , anomalous power value . for scenario ( a ) , @xmath68 anomaly time is sufficient to modify the drift coefficient and potential noticeably at power values @xmath75 .",
    "we observe for scenario ( b ) that a longer anomaly time of @xmath70 brings new fixed points at @xmath76 in the rated power region .",
    "the drift coefficient displays multiple stable fixed points , and the potential has several local minima .",
    "the intermittent anomaly in scenario ( c ) is also detected in the drift coefficient and potential .",
    "less fixed points are created in the langevin power curve , due to the fact that the anomaly scatters over the entire state space @xmath65 .",
    "it is not as localized in the state space as the continuous anomaly in scenario ( b ) , so that it affects a larger region of the state space , but to a lesser extent . finally for scenario ( d ) , both dynamical states are recorded by the drift coefficient that clearly detects the anomaly superposed to the normal operation .     and ; ( middle ) drift potential @xmath73 for the wind speed bin @xmath77 ( @xmath78 m/s ) ; ( bottom ) langevin power curve @xmath74 for the wind sector @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) for scenarios ( a - d ) ( left to right ) . in each plot , the anomaly case ( bold black line / black crosses ) is compared to the normal case ( gray line / full gray dots ) and to the full anomaly case ( dashed gray line / open gray dots ) .",
    "the drift potential is arbitrarily shifted upwards for comparison ( minimum set to zero ) . in the ( lower ) figures ,",
    "the dotted vertical line indicates the wind speed bin @xmath77 . ]    at last , the intermittent anomaly is considered again , yet this time the duration of the anomaly is varied , see figure [ fig : compare_potential_intermittent ] .",
    "one sees that when the intermittent anomaly only takes place 6 hours ( @xmath79 ) or less , the potential does not change . yet",
    "if the intermittent anomaly occurs over a duration of 12 hours ( @xmath68 ) or longer , the potential clearly deviates from the normal case .",
    "the deviation increases with increasing duration , as the potential approaches the full anomaly case .",
    "this type of dynamical behavior is reminiscent of phases transitions .",
    "it is similar to the cusp catastrophe described in catastrophe theory , see e.g. ref .",
    "thus , the potential follows the generic law of the form @xmath80 , where @xmath81 causes the bistability of the system . for a bistable system , the slope of the drift coefficient changes from negative to positive to negative again ( instead of being only negative in the presence of only one attractive fixed point ) . in our case ,",
    "we see how the parameter @xmath82 causes the phase transition by shifting @xmath83 along the @xmath84axis and also causes the transition from one to two stable fixed points .",
    "this kind of bifurcation caused by the weighted mixing of two phases was also observed , e.g. for the differential resistance of some nonequilibrium semi- and super - conductor systems @xcite .     for the wind speed bin @xmath77 ( @xmath78 m/s ) and wind sector @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) for an intermittent anomaly of varying duration ( see legend ) .",
    "the drift potentials are given for the measured normal case ( full red line ) and the case when the anomaly lasts during the total 14-day period ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the curves are arbitrarily shifted upwards ( minimum set to zero ) for comparison . ]      in summary , we conclude from the sensitivity analysis that the drift coefficient is a better estimate than the iec power curve to monitor the power performance of the wind farm . it reacts faster to a change in the farm dynamics than a procedure based on ten - minute averaging .",
    "this comes from the fact that the iec method gives an average result that deviates slowly .",
    "in contrast to this the drift estimate can detect the bistable dynamics , which provides much more insight onto the cause of the anomaly , as an emerging bistability clearly indicates that something does not function properly .",
    "we observe in scenario ( a ) that the drift coefficient of the entire farm changes significantly when one of the twelve turbines is shut down during @xmath68 of the time .",
    "scenario ( b ) illustrates that the same turbine must be shut down during at least @xmath70 of the time for the iec method to detect it .",
    "additionally , scenario ( c ) shows that if the anomaly switches the turbine on and off intermittently , the iec power curve can no longer detect it affirmatively .",
    "the drift coefficient detects the intermittent anomalies as well as the continuous ones , in both cases the anomaly needs only last @xmath68 of the time to be detected .",
    "for this reason , we promote the drift coefficient and the corresponding langevin power curve as improved macroscopic estimates for wind farm performance monitoring .",
    "the conversion process of an onshore wind farm is analyzed at a sampling frequency of 1hz .",
    "clear dynamics appear when considering the effective wind speed @xmath7 and ten - minute average direction @xmath1 averaged over all wind turbines , as well as their cumulative power production @xmath9 .",
    "fast power fluctuations of up to @xmath60 around the power curve are measured continuously , stressing the need for a more evolved description .",
    "feature - rich dynamics are observed at the time scales of few seconds where the wind farm reacts to wind fluctuations .",
    "we propose a new approach where this conversion process @xmath85 is modeled as a stochastic langevin process .",
    "two model coefficients are estimated from the data set measured , and describe intuitively the wind farm dynamics : the drift coefficient describes the attraction towards an attractive power curve , and the diffusion coefficient represents additional turbulent fluctuations .",
    "in addition , we introduce an additional pre - model of wind speed fluctuations , such that only ten - minute wind data is needed to model the power output at 1hz .",
    "a statistical analysis confirms that the langevin model reproduces the complex properties of the measurement well , including its intermittent features .",
    "such high - frequency dynamics can not be modeled correctly using a power curve method , that only describes the long - term dynamics . beyond predicting the trend of the wind power production ,",
    "our model predicts realistic power fluctuations at 1hz , so that the impact of wind fluctuations on the grid stability can be forecast .",
    "also , the added insight helps understand the dynamical response of large wind installations to wind fluctuations , such that smart grid concepts can be further refined .",
    "thanks to their general flexible structure , such stochastic methods can be upscaled easily in order to understand and model the large wind installations that will populate future electric networks .    as a second application , we show that the drift coefficient is a compact measure of the global performance of a wind installation , making it a powerful tool to monitor the power performance of a wind farm .",
    "it captures more information about the dynamical behavior of the wind farm than the iec power curve .",
    "for example , the drift coefficient detects a significant change in the global wind farm dynamics if one of twelve turbines is shut down during @xmath4 of the time , whereas an anomaly time of almost @xmath57 is needed for the iec power curve to detect it .",
    "the iec power curve is also at a disadvantage when in presence of anomalies that intermittently switch off a turbine during a short time , because the time averaging it applies strongly reduces the sensitivity to dynamical changes faster than ten minutes . on the contrary ,",
    "the drift coefficient is equally reactive to intermittent and continuous anomalies .",
    "such stochastic analysis can be useful for the real - time monitoring of wind farms .",
    "it can be applied in addition to existing tools to give some first information about the entire farm .",
    "if a potential anomaly is detected , the stochastic analysis can then be performed in greater detail for single wind turbines .",
    "if an anomaly still appears then , a full ( microscopic ) analysis of all the turbine sensors is justified . also here",
    ", a stochastic analysis may be helpful too for damage detection , see ref .",
    "our approach is fruitful as a first tool to alert of an occurring anomaly .",
    "we thank the land of lower saxony , the german ministry for environment and the german ministry for education and research for funding this research project .",
    "we also thank deutsche windtechnik ag bremen for providing us with wind turbine data .",
    "we would also like to thank philip rinn , mehrnaz anvari , david bastine , benjamin wahl , mohammad reza rahimi tabar , allan morales , tanja mcke and michael hlling for the many fruitful discussions .",
    "a stochastic approach was presented in section [ sec : model ] to generate time series of power output for the wind farm .",
    "the stochastic signals are generated by solving a langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) in time .",
    "the langevin process generated is a stochastic drift / diffusion process .",
    "the drift coefficient @xmath86 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath87 approximate to a first and second order how the wind farm converts a wind field @xmath88 into a power output @xmath2 .",
    "the langevin equation being by nature stochastic , the process simulated @xmath2 has a random character .",
    "this means that if the same langevin equation is solved @xmath30 times with identical wind conditions , the new signal simulated each time will always be different to some degree , owing to the random nature of the langevin noise @xmath89 in equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) ( but its statistics wo nt change ) . while the value of @xmath2 at a given time @xmath53 is random , the probability @xmath90 of having a power value @xmath9 at time @xmath53 is fixed .",
    "the probability density function of the langevin process @xmath2 at any given time @xmath53 is uniquely defined as the solution of the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath91 where the kramers - moyal coefficients are estimated following equation ( [ eq : kmc ] ) .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is the equivalent in the probability domain of the langevin equation in the time domain .",
    "if the probability @xmath90 is desired instead of simply one sample value @xmath2 , the fokker - planck equation should be solved over time . , we calculate @xmath92 by repeatedly solving the equation @xmath93 over an infinitesimal time step @xmath94 , where the conditional probability @xmath95 is completely described by @xmath83 and @xmath96 .",
    "one can visualize how the drift and diffusion coefficients concurrently contract and stretch the pdf over time . ]",
    "an example is presented in figure [ fig : l_fp ] where the fokker - planck equation is solved at 1hz using as initial condition a dirac distribution @xmath97 .",
    "we see at six exemplary times @xmath53 what the measured power value @xmath2 is , and the probability @xmath90 estimated by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the difference @xmath98 between the most probable power value given by the fokker - planck equation @xmath99 and the measurement @xmath2 is calculated for 36000 samples , and its histogram is presented in figure [ fig : fp_deviation ] .",
    "@xmath98 is rather centered around zero , has a mean value @xmath100 and a standard deviation @xmath101 .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath2 is equal to @xmath102 , that is 9 times as large as the standard deviation of the difference .",
    "this means that the most probable power value predicted by the fokker - planck equation @xmath99 deviates from the measurement by only @xmath103 on average .",
    "this concludes that the pdf simulated by the fokker - planck equation follows the measurement faithfully .",
    "the drift coefficient @xmath86 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath87 are defined in each bin of the three - dimensional phase space @xmath106 .",
    "a parametric form is presented in subsection [ sec : model2 ] where in each sub - domain @xmath107 , the drift is simplified to a linear function @xmath108 and the diffusion to a constant @xmath109 .",
    "the two parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 are fitted from the drift and diffusion coefficients estimated . however , some artifacts such as low data sampling or the presence of measurement noise within the data affect the estimated kramers - moyal coefficients , which then deviate from the true coefficients of the system .",
    "we propose an optimization procedure that corrects this discrepancy by refining the estimation of @xmath83 and @xmath96 .    as long as the system stays inside the given sub - domain @xmath107 ,",
    "the local dynamics are dictated by the local values of drift and diffusion . during that period of time , the dynamics do not change and the system fluctuates around the power curve value @xmath112 .",
    "this corresponds to the pdf @xmath90 relaxing to a stationary form @xmath104 that is given by @xmath113 giving @xmath114 where @xmath30 is a normalization constant such that @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath104 is the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation , that corresponds to the stationary case where @xmath83 and @xmath96 do not change in time . in the limit of a system that reacts infinitely fast to the changing wind condition",
    ", one can consider that between two changes of the wind condition , the system has time to relax to its stationary state and wait for the next change .",
    "we assume that our system is reasonably close to this limit , owing to the low dispersion of the data around the power curve ( see figure [ fig : up_1hz ] ) .",
    "this means that all the data @xmath116 contained in the sub - domain @xmath107 is assumed to have relaxed towards its local power curve value @xmath112 , and its pdf is @xmath117 the two pdfs @xmath118 and @xmath104 are presented in figure [ fig : power_histo_model2 ] for various wind speed bins .",
    "we observe a reasonably good agreement between the two pdfs , which can be improved .",
    "the optimization is based on the fact that the pdfs are reasonably close to a gaussian distribution @xmath119 with @xmath36 and @xmath120 the mean and standard deviation of @xmath116 . observing the analogy between equations ( [ eq : fp_stat_opt ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : fp_stat_opt_gauss ] ) , we optimize the drift and diffusion coefficients following @xmath121 the stationary pdf calculated from the optimized coefficients is presented in figure [ fig : power_histo_model2 ] .",
    "we observe a better agreement to the measured pdfs , validating the optimization procedure . over all wind speed bins @xmath44 , we find for the average @xmath122 that the optimization reduces the value by a factor @xmath123 . ] to summarize , we relate the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation to the pdf of the measured power data , in each wind speed / direction sub - domain .",
    "this way we can fine - tune the parametric form of the drift and diffusion coefficients to reproduce exactly the distribution of the measured data .",

    "<S> these stochastic coefficients are inserted into a langevin equation that , once properly adapted to our particular system , models a synthetic signal of power output for any given wind speed / direction signals , see section [ sec : model ] . when combined with a pre - model for turbulent wind fluctuations , the stochastic approach models the power output of the wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1hz using only ten - minute average values of wind speed and directions . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic signals generated are compared to the measured signal , and show a good statistical agreement , including a proper reproduction of the intermittent , gusty features measured . in parallel , a second application for performance monitoring is introduced in section [ sec : monitor ] . </S>",
    "<S> the drift coefficient can be used as a sensitive measure of the global wind farm performance . when monitoring the wind farm as a whole , the drift coefficient registers some significant deviation from normal operation if one of twelve wind turbines is shut down during less than @xmath4 of the time . </S>",
    "<S> also , intermittent anomalies can be detected more rapidly than when using ten - minute averaging methods . </S>",
