    "we analyze several point processes having similar power - law shapes at small scales , but different visual aspect .",
    "the differences are encapsulated in the behavior of the correlation function at large scales as well as in other statistical measures ( [ 3 ] ) .",

    "a segment cox process has been produced by randomly scattering segments of length @xmath3 with a density @xmath4 within a cube of side 100 , and then randomly distributing points on the segments with density @xmath5 per unit length .",

    "the differences of the clustering properties of the three point processes are better appreciated at large scale . for the cox process @xmath10 for @xmath11 whereas @xmath0 for the n - body simulation @xmath0 approaches zero more gradually , taking place the first zero crossing at @xmath12 . for the voronoi vertices model",
