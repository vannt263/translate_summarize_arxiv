    "graphitic systems are used for a wide variety of industrial applications , ranging from lubricant and refractory materials to neutron moderators in nuclear fission reactors@xcite and plasma shields in the next generation of fusion reactors@xcite .",
    "the recent realization of graphene@xcite ( single graphitic layer ) and the discovery of its unusual electronic properties@xcite have raised the interest on flake graphitic systems as a route to produce graphene samples of high quality and in large scale@xcite .    despite the technological and scientific importance of graphitic systems ,",
    "the knowledge of their elastic properties is unexpectedly poor and new insights are needed .",

    ", they are even more important for the thermodynamic properties due to a low - lying branch of acoustic vibrations , the bending modes , predicted by lifshitz@xcite over fifty years ago . here we show that the shear elastic constant @xmath0 affects the mechanism of exfoliation that is relevant for the production of graphene",
    ".    the most reliable experimental studies of the elastic constants have been obtained by inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite and ultrasonic , sonic resonance , and static test methods@xcite .",
    "the sample used in the first study@xcite was single - crystalline kish graphite , characterized by an extraordinary high degree of ordering , the closest approximation to the perfect ab stacking graphite ( hex - g ) .",
    "the second study@xcite was done using highly oriented pyrolitic graphite , the closest approximation to turbostratic graphite ( turbo - g ) where the graphitic layers are randomly oriented around the c - axis .",
    "except for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both studies are in agreement within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath1 value in turbo - g was determined only by the less accurate static test method and it may be affected by errors .",
    "conversely , @xmath0 in turbo - g was determined from the sound velocity and its value ranges between 0.18 - 0.35 gpa@xcite , one order of magnitude lower than 5.03 gpa found in hex - g@xcite .",
    "the discrepancy on @xmath0 is attributed to the existence of mobile basal dislocations@xcite .",
    "after neutron irradiation , the elastic constant @xmath0 increases by up to an order of magnitude@xcite , suggesting that interstitial defects@xcite could pin the dislocation motions , whence the intrinsic value of @xmath0 is measured .",
    "a principal difficulty with this explanation is that interstitial atoms inevitably increase the shear resistance between graphitic layers and therefore they may increase the @xmath0 value by themselves .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate from first principles the elastic constants of graphitic systems with respect to the stacking misorientations between layers , and to describe the key role of the shear elastic constant @xmath0 on the bending modes ( thermal property ) and mechanical stability .",
    "we show that stacking misorientations greatly affect @xmath0 and that graphitic systems with perfect ( hex - g ) and random ( turbo - g ) stacking should be considered as two distinct materials described by their own elastic and thermodynamic properties .",

    "the k - point mesh was chosen so that the average density corresponds approximately to a 32x32x16 mesh for hex - g .",
    "energies were converged within 0.05 mev / atom , and elastic constants within 0.5% . for large supercells ( turbo - g with more than 50 atoms )",
    "we have used localized basis - set composed of gaussian orbitals ( aimpro code)@xcite .",
    "the elastic constants calculated by the two lda codes are in agreement within 3% or better .",
    "the choice of lda is not fortuitous@xcite and it was dictated by test calculations using the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof scheme@xcite . according to gga , the distance between graphitic layers is far too large ( 4.2  ) , resulting in a negligible interlayer binding energy and almost vanishing out - of - plane elastic constants ( @xmath0 , @xmath3 ) . for these reasons",
    "we have dismissed the use of gga from this study@xcite .",
    "even though lda yields accurate equilibrium distances , due to energetical error compensations , the long - range van der waals ( vdw ) and more generally the weak contribution to the out - of - plane interactions is not well described@xcite . in order to check the importance of these effects on @xmath0 and @xmath3 ,",
    "we have used the lcao - s@xmath2+vdw formalism to include these specific interactions within lda@xcite ( using fireball code)@xcite .",
    "this formalism takes into account two major contributions . the first one , which we call weak chemical interaction , is a repulsive energy originating from the overlaps of electronic densities between the weakly interacting subsystems .",
    "even though the overlaps are rather small , this energy is not negligible .",
    "this contribution is evaluated proceeding to a second order expansion of the electronic wavefunctions with respect to the overlaps .",
    "the second contribution , which is the vdw itself , originating from charge fluctuations , can be seen as the interaction between electronic dipoles . in the frame of the dipolar approximation",

    "this method has originally been tested with success on standard graphene - graphene interaction , and more recently on a wide range of graphitic materials@xcite . in its current stage ,",
    "the analysis of the internal stresses is not implemented yet , thus the elastic constants that change the in - plane bond lengths ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath1 ) are overestimated by up to 15% . however , for @xmath0 and @xmath3 that describe the weak interaction between layers , the internal stresses are negligible , and the calculated values are expected to be very accurate .",
    "the elastic constants are determined using two different approaches .",
    "the first one uses the response - function , implemented in the abinit code , to calculate the second derivative of the total energy with respect to the strains .",
    "the second approach uses the elastic energy density@xcite . for each elastic constant we have applied 21 strain components @xmath6 to the equilibrium crystal structures ( @xmath6 were typically ranging between 0.01 with increments 0.001 ) .",
