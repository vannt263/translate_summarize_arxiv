    "a very successful series of experiments @xcite - @xcite was performed at slac during last years . in these experiments",
    "the cross section of bremsstrahlung of soft photons with energy from 200  kev to 500  mev from electrons with energy 8  gev and 25  gev is measured with an accuracy of the order of a few percent . both lpm ( the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , i.e. suppression of the bremsstrahlung from high energy electron due to a multiple scattering of an emitting electron in dense media @xcite- @xcite ) and dielectric suppression ( the effects of the polarization of a medium , @xcite ) are observed and investigated .",
    "these experiments were the challenge for the theory since in all the previous papers calculations ( cited in @xcite ) are performed to logarithmic accuracy which is not enough for description of the new experiment .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb corrections ( at least for heavy elements ) is larger then experimental errors and these corrections should be taken into account .",
    "very recently authors developed the new approach to the theory of lpm effect @xcite , where the cross section of bremsstrahlung process in the photon energies region where the influence of the lpm is very strong was calculated with term @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is characteristic logarithm of the problem , and with the coulomb corrections taken into account . in the photon energy region , where the lpm effect is `` turned off ''",
    ", the obtained cross section gives the exact bethe - heitler cross section ( within power accuracy ) with coulomb corrections .",
    "this important feature was absent in the previous calculations .",
    "the contribution of an inelastic scattering of a projectile on atomic electrons is also included .",
    "the polarization of a medium is incorporated into this approach . the considerable contribution into the soft part of the measured spectrum of radiation",
    "gives a photon emission on the boundaries of a target .",
    "we calculated this contribution taking into account the multiple scattering and polarization of a medium for the case when a target is much thicker than the formation length of the radiation .",
    "we considered also a case when a target is much thinner than the formation length .",
    "a case of an intermediate thickness of a target ( between cases of a thick and a thin target ) is analyzed later in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in the experiments @xcite-@xcite the summary energy of all photons radiated by a single electron is measured .",
    "this means that besides mentioned above effects there is an additional `` calorimetric '' effect due to the multiple photon radiation .",
    "this effect is especially important in relatively thick used targets . since the energy losses spectrum of an electron is actually measured , which is not coincide in this case with the spectrum of photons radiated in a single interaction , one have to consider the distribution function of electrons over energy after passage of a target .",
    "as it is known , this distribution function is the solution of the corresponding kinetic equation .",
    "however , the problem can be simplified essentially if one is interested in the soft part of the energy losses spectrum .",
    "just this situation was in the experiments @xcite-@xcite , since the measurements were performed in the region of the photon energies of one to five orders of magnitude lower than the electron energy .    in sec .",
    "2 of the present paper the general approach to the consideration of the soft part of the energy losses spectrum due to of many photons emission from a single electron is formulated without limitation of the target thickness .",
    "the case when the formation length is larger than the target thickness is analyzed also . using this approach we calculated corrections ( in a form of the reduction factor ) to the spectrum of energy losses for the bethe - heitler case as well as for the situation when the lpm effect is strong and when the transition radiation is essential . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze basic properties of the phenomenon and apply the theory developed in @xcite with multiphoton corrections to discussion of data @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the theory is in a perfect agreement with data . in appendix",
    "we calculate the radiation probability of arbitrary number of hard photons .",
    "the probability of the successive radiation of @xmath2 soft photons with energies @xmath3 by a particle with energy @xmath4 on the length @xmath5 in the energy intervals @xmath6 is given by expression ( in this paper , we employ units such that @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the normalization constant , @xmath10 is the differential probability of the photon radiation per unit length , @xmath11 is the differential probability of the photon radiation per length @xmath5 . if the probability @xmath12 does nt depend on the particle energy @xmath13 then integrating ( [ 1 ] ) over all photon energies we obtain @xmath14 the value @xmath9 is defined by the condition that probability of all the possible events with radiation of any number of photons or without photon radiation is equal to unit .",
    "@xmath15 using ( [ 1]),([3 ] )",
    "we can write the expression for the differential distribution of the energy losses in the form @xmath16 here on on the right - hand side we have the sum of the probabilities of radiation of @xmath2 photons with summary energy @xmath17 .    using standard parametrization of @xmath18-function @xmath19 we obtain @xmath20 d\\omega_1\\right\\}ds \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\frac{1}{\\pi}~{\\rm re } \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\exp\\left(ix \\right ) \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{dw}{d\\omega_1 } \\left[1-\\exp\\left(-ix\\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega}\\right)\\right ] d\\omega_1\\right\\}dx \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the formula ( [ 5 ] ) was derived by landau @xcite as solution of the kinetic equation under assumption that energy losses are much smaller than particle s energy ( the paper @xcite was devoted to the ionization losses ) .",
    "let us notice the following .",
    "the energy losses are defined by the hard part of the radiation spectrum . in the soft part of the energy losses spectrum ( [ 5 ] ) the probability of radiation of one hard photon",
    "only is taken into account accurately . to calculate the probability of the emission of two and more hard photons one has to take into account step by step the recoil in previous acts of the photon emission .",
    "the probability of radiation of two and more hard photons is of the order @xmath21 and so on .",
    "thus , the formula ( [ 5 ] ) is applicable for the thin targets and has accuracy @xmath22 . if we want to improve accuracy of the formula ( [ 5 ] ) and for the case of thick targets @xmath23 one has to consider radiation of an arbitrary number of hard photons .",
    "this problem is solved in appendix for the case when hard part of the radiation spectrum is described by the bethe - heitler formula . in this case",
    "the formula ( [ 5 ] ) acquires the additional factor . as a result we extend this formula on the case thick targets .",
    "we will analyze first the interval of photon energies where bethe - heitler formula is valid .",
    "we write it in the form @xmath24",
    "\\vartheta(\\varepsilon-\\omega)= \\beta\\left(1-x_1 + \\frac{3}{4}x_1 ^ 2 \\right)\\vartheta(1-x_1 ) , \\label{7}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the thickness of the target , @xmath25 is the radiation length , @xmath26 the integral in the curly brackets in ( [ 5 ] ) we split into two integrals with integration intervals @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where we choose @xmath29 such that @xmath30 ( note , that the radiation probability vanishes for @xmath31 ) .",
    "we will begin with consideration of rather thin targets such that @xmath32 ( the case @xmath33 will be discussed below ) . in this case in the integral over @xmath34 in ( [ 5 ] ) contributes mainly @xmath35 and the integral over the second interval is @xmath36 d\\omega_1 \\simeq \\int_{\\omega'}^{\\varepsilon}\\frac{dw}{d\\omega_1}d\\omega_1 = \\beta \\left(\\ln \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\omega ' } -\\frac{5}{8 } \\right ) ,   \\label{8}\\ ] ] the integral containing @xmath37 vanishes because of the fast oscillations of the integrand .",
    "the integration over the first interval gives @xmath38d\\omega_1 \\simeq \\beta \\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\omega'}{\\omega}x \\right)+c+ i\\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\right ] , \\label{9}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the euler constant .",
    "so , the total integral over @xmath40 in ( [ 5 ] ) is @xmath41 substituting this result into ( [ 5 ] ) we have @xmath42 dx \\label{11}\\ ] ] in this integral we turn the integration contour over @xmath34 by angle @xmath43 and substitute @xmath44 . as a result",
    "we find @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the euler gamma function .",
    "if we consider radiation of the one soft photon , we have from ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath47 .",
    "thus , formula ( [ 12 ] ) gives additional `` reduction factor '' @xmath48 which characterizes the distortion of the soft bethe - heitler spectrum due to multiple photons radiation . with regard for factor @xmath49 ( see appendix eqs.([a.15 ] ) , ( [ a.16 ] ) we obtain the reduction factor valid for @xmath50 while eq.([12 ] ) is true for @xmath51 ) @xmath52 in fig.1 the function @xmath53 is given for electron with the energy @xmath13 = 25  gev .",
    "one can see that for @xmath17 = 100  mev the value @xmath53 differs from unit in 5 - 6 times greater than value @xmath54 .",
    "let us discuss this circumstance .",
    "the emission of accompanying photons with energy much lesser or of the order of @xmath17 ( we consider in this figure the situation connected with slac experiment @xcite-@xcite where @xmath55 ) changes the spectral distribution on quantity order of @xmath54 .",
    "however , if one photon with energy @xmath56 is emitted , at least , then photon with energy @xmath17 is not registered at all in the corresponding chanel of the calorimeter . since mean number of photons with energy larger than @xmath17 is determined by the expression ( see ( [ 1])-([5 ] ) ) @xmath57 the probability of the event when no photon with energy @xmath56 is radiated is defined by @xmath58 .",
    "this is just the main factor in the expression for the reduction factor @xmath48 ( [ 13 ] ) while the difference begins with the terms @xmath59 . in the case ,",
    "when radiation is described by the bethe - heitler formula the value @xmath60 increases as a logarithm with @xmath17 decrease ( @xmath61 ) and for large ratio @xmath62 the value @xmath60 is much larger than @xmath54 .",
    "thus , amplification of the effect is connected with large interval of the integration at evaluation of the radiation probability of a hard photon .",
    "the bethe - heitler formula becomes inapplicable for the photon energies @xmath63 , where lpm effect starts to manifest itself ( see @xcite ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the expression for the photon spectrum for this case can be obtained from @xcite , sec.2 @xmath66 in this expression the terms @xmath67 ( see @xcite ) are not taken into account , since the terms of this type can be neglected at calculation of the reduction factor ( the terms of the order @xmath68 ) . using ( [ 15 ] ) we calculate now the total probability of radiation @xmath69 . as it was done above",
    ", we divide the integration interval into two parts @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath70 . in the interval",
    "@xmath28 the bethe - heitler formula is valid and we have for @xmath71 formula ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the integral over the second interval is @xmath72 performing integration by parts in the expression for @xmath73 we have @xmath74 into the integral over @xmath75 in ( [ 16 ] ) the interval @xmath76 contributes , so that @xmath77 .",
    "because of this we can expand the first term on the right - hand side of formula ( [ 17 ] ) and put the lower limit of integration equal to zero in the second term and than turn the integration contour by angle @xmath78 .",
    "we find @xmath79 using the integrals @xmath80 we have @xmath81 adding to this result the probability of radiation @xmath71 we obtain for the total probability of radiation @xmath82    we consider now the spectral distribution of the energy losses in the conditions of the strong lpm effect @xmath83 . in this case the contribution into the integral defining the function @xmath84 in ( [ 15 ] ) gives an interval @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 .",
    "we have as a result @xmath87 let us use this result in the integral in formula ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath88 substituting ( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) into formula ( [ 5 ] ) and taking into account the factor @xmath49 ( [ a.15 ] ) we obtain for the energy losses @xmath89 the main contribution to the last integral gives @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath90 and one can expand the integrand in ( [ 24 ] ) in powers of @xmath91 . conserving the two first term of the expansion we have integrals @xmath92 using this integrals we find for the distribution of the spectral energy losses @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the reduction factor in the photon energy range where the lpm effect is essential . in fig.2 the function @xmath95",
    "is shown for @xmath96100  mev ( @xmath13 = 25  gev , @xmath97 = 228  mev ) .",
    "taking in consideration that @xmath98 and using eq.([22 ] ) we find ( see also discussion after ( [ 13 ] ) ) @xmath99 in the last expression the coefficient 3@xmath100 entering into the term @xmath101 differs from exact value in ( [ 26 ] ) on factor @xmath102=1.27 only .",
    "it is seen in fig.2 that the reduction factor @xmath94 changes appreciably in the region of high photon energies solely .",
    "this is due to the fact that here the total probability of photon radiation is finite ( in contract to the bethe - heitler formula ) and the integral which defines this probability converges at @xmath103 .    in the above analysis we neglected an influence of the polarization of a medium on the bremsstrahlung",
    "this is correct if @xmath104 ( see ( [ 15 ] ) and @xcite , sec.3 ) where @xmath105 where @xmath2 is the electron density .",
    "we assume , for definiteness , that @xmath106 .",
    "this is true in any case for a dense matter if electron energy @xmath107 . in the opposite case",
    "when @xmath108 there is an additional suppression of the bremsstrahlung ( see @xcite , sec.3 ) : @xmath109 and this contribution into reduction factor ( [ 26 ] ) can be neglected .    the main contribution into effect considered for the photon energies such that @xmath110 gives the transition radiation the differential probability of the transition radiation on the boundary of the vacuum and a medium is ( neglecting interference between nearby edges ,",

    "however , for application of formula ( [ 5 ] ) it is enough that acts of radiation of soft photons are statistically independent .",
