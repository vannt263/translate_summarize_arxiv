    "the role of starbursts in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is an issue which permeates the history of agn literature .",
    "theoretical scenarios for a `` starburst - agn connection '' vary from those in which starbursts are a key piece of the agn machinery , either through symbiotic or evolutionary processes ( e.g. , perry & dyson 1985 ; sanders 1988 ; norman & scoville 1988 ; rees 1989 ; daly 1990 ; terlevich 1992 ; williams , baker & perry 1999 ) , to those in which these are fundamentally decoupled phenomena , but which are likely to coexist merely because both are triggered by and live on gas fueling ( e.g. , byrd 1986 ; byrd , sundeluis & valtonen 1987 ; lin , pringle & rees 1988 ; heller & shlosman 1994 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "given the enormous breadth of possibilities in between these extremes , it is likely that progress in understanding this connection will be driven more by input from observations than from theoretical considerations .",
    "observational work during the past decade has indeed substantially advanced our ability to recognize starbursts in the complex inner environment of agn .",
    "optical and uv studies of seyfert 2 galaxies have been particularly enlightening in this respect . in a series of papers ( heckman 1997 ; cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann & schmitt 1998 ; gonzlez delgado 1998 ; storchi - bergmann , cid fernandes & schmitt 1998 ; schmitt , storchi - bergmann & cid fernandes 1999 ; storchi - bergmann 2000 ; gonzlez delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ) we have detected unambiguous signatures of young massive stars within @xmath9 pc of the nucleus in 30 to 50% of seyfert 2 s by means of high quality optical and , whenever possible , uv spectroscopy .",
    "this result fits well with the near ir studies of oliva ( 1995 , 1999 ) , which find a comparable incidence of starbursts in seyfert 2 s through measurements of the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the starbursts in these composite starburst@xmath0agn systems can make a significant contribution to the total luminosity output .",
    "in fact , studies specifically aimed at candidate composite galaxies , as selected by emission line ratios intermediate between hii regions and agn on classical diagnostic diagrams , demonstrate that their far ir and radio properties are dominated by star - forming activity at the 90% level ( hill 2001 , 1999 ) .",
    "even the presence of compact radio cores , a more classical indicator of agn activity ( condon 1991 ; sramek & weedman 1986 ; norris 1990 ) , can be accounted for by star - formation ( hill 2001 ; kewley 2000 ; smith 1998a , b ; lonsdale , smith & lonsdale 1993 ) .",
    "other recent results are covered in the review by veilleux ( 2001 ) and the volume edited by aretxaga , kunth & mugica ( 2001 ) .",
    "evidence is also steadily accumulating that associates agn with star - formation on galactic scales .",
    "the ubiquity of super - massive black holes in the nuclei of normal galaxies in the local universe ( ho 1999 ) , the proportionality between bulge and black - hole masses ( magorrian 1998 ; gebhart 2000 ; ferrarese & merrit 2000 ) , the link between @xmath10 and the age of the last major star - formation episode in the spheroid ( merrifield , forbes & terlevich 2000 ) , all imply that the creation of these black holes and the ensuing qso activity were an integral part of the formation of ellipticals and galactic bulges .",
    "this fossil evidence indirectly traces a much more active past , in which both copious star - formation and nuclear activity coexisted .",
    "since the technology to directly study this high redshift era in detail is not available , we must guide our study of the starburst - agn connection by data gathered on nearby objects in which traces of this connection are caught _ in fraganti_. this means refining our knowledge of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert galaxies . in the optical - uv range , as hinted above , this is best accomplished studying type 2 seyferts . their favorable geometry , in which the blinding glare of the nucleus is blocked away by a dusty torus , facilitates the detection of features from circum - nuclear starbursts , thus making them the best - suited local laboratories to study the starburst - agn connection .",
    "advancing our empirical understanding of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert galaxies can be described as a 3-stage process : ( i ) identifying starbursts in these systems ; ( ii ) characterizing the properties of the starburst ( age and mass , or star - formation rate ) and the agn ( black - hole mass , accretion rate ) ; and ( iii ) investigating possible connections between these properties .",
    "once we get to this third stage fundamental questions can start to be addressed .",
    "for instance : is star - formation inextricably associated with agn activity ?",
    "are the starburst and agn powers related , say , by a @xmath11 proportionality between their masses ? or , analogously , is the star - formation rate connected to the rate of accretion onto the nuclear super - massive black - hole ? does the central engine evolve in parallel to the starburst around it ?",
    "much work remains to be done before tackling these key questions .",
    "the work on seyfert 2 s reviewed above pertains mostly to stage i of this process , as it essentially demonstrates how certain spectral features of massive stars can be used as sign - posts of starburst activity .",
    "estimates of the recent history of star - formation in the circum - nuclear regions were also presented , thus touching the domain of stage ii .",
    "these estimates come associated with known difficulties in accurately retrieving the detailed star - formation history of stellar systems ( e.g. , leitherer 1999 ; cid fernandes 2001 ; kennicutt 1998 ) , but they represent the current state - of - the - art regarding the characterization of the basic starburst properties .",
    "this paper deals mainly with stage i , that is , the identification of starbursts in seyfert 2 s , using the data sets of cid fernandes ( 1998 ) and gonzlez delgado ( 2001 , hereafter gd01 ) as a training set .",
    "this is probably the largest sample whose optical spectra have been systematically and carefully screened for starburst features , so it represents a good starting point .",
    "the analysis is geared towards verifying whether composite seyfert 2/starburst systems , those in which stellar features produced by young populations have been directly detected , exhibit other properties which differentiate them from systems not showing signs of starburst activity ( `` pure '' seyfert 2 s ) . unlike the detailed analysis reported by the previous work on these data , we here limit ourselves to easily measurable quantities .",
    "specifically , we will use equivalent widths of strong absorption bands and continuum colors in the near uv , emission line equivalent widths , fluxes and line ratios , far ir luminosities and near uv surface brightness .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is two - fold :    * to verify whether the optical continuum and emission line properties of composite systems are consistent with the expected impact of starbursts upon these observables . * to investigate alternative ways to infer the presence of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s that may provide more straightforward diagnostics applicable to larger and/or more distant samples .",
    "the first of these points serves both as a consistency check and to give a sense of the role played by starbursts in the phenomenology and energetics of agn .",
    "the relevance of the second point is that increasing the statistics is crucial to improve upon the still sketchy overall census of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s , to extend these studies to higher redshifts and to provide the raw material for further stage ii and iii studies .    in  [ sec : sample ] we describe the data for the seyfert 2 s and comparison samples used in this study . in  [ sec : synthesis ] we deal with the problem of estimating the `` featureless continuum '' ( fc ) strength .",
    "we apply a method based on population synthesis , but which can be parameterized in terms of a few easily measurable quantities . essentially , we are able to estimate the fc contribution to the optical light with little more than the equivalent width of the caii k absorption line , a method which may be of wide applicability in seyfert 2 studies . in  [ sec : emission_lines ] we present an analysis of the emission line equivalent widths , line ratios and profiles , and discuss how they are affected by the presence of circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "emission line - fc correlations are also presented and discussed . in  [ sec : iras ] we investigate how the composite systems behave in terms of far ir luminosity and how they fare in comparison to normal and interacting galaxies . in  [",
    "sec : surfbrightness ] we compare the near uv surface brightness of seyfert 2 s in our sample to that of normal and starburst galaxies . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we collect the results obtained in a set of empirical criteria which may be used to diagnose the presence of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s .",
    "we also discuss the meaning of the composite/``pure '' seyfert 2 classification and present tentative evidence of evolutionary effects in our sample .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this study we merge the seyfert 2 s in the southern sample studied by cid fernandes ( 1998 ) with those in the northern sample of gd01 , totaling 35 galaxies .",
    "details of the observations , sample selection and previous analysis of these data can be found in the original papers and heckman ( 1997 ) , gonzlez delgado ( 1998 ) , storchi - bergmann ( 1998 ) , schmitt ( 1999 ) and storchi - bergmann ( 2000 , hereafter sb00 ) .",
    "we concentrate our analysis on the nuclear spectra , extracted through @xmath12 apertures for the northern sample and @xmath13 for the southern one . at the distances of our galaxies",
    "this covers a region 60860 pc in radius , with a median of 300 pc ( @xmath14 km@xmath15s@xmath16mpc@xmath17 is adopted throughout this paper ) .",
    "we will also focus on the near uv to optical region of the spectrum , between 3500 and 5100  .",
    "these 35 galaxies will hereafter be referred to as the `` seyfert 2 sample '' .",
    "they constitute a good data set to investigate the starburst - agn connection because the above papers have scrutinized these sources in search for signs of a starburst component .",
    "specifically , the following signatures of a starburst were examined : ( 1 ) the presence of far - uv stellar wind lines ( nv @xmath181240 , siiv@xmath181397 and civ@xmath181549 ) due to o stars ; ( 2 ) high order balmer absorption lines of hi and hei in the near uv ; ( 3 ) the wr bump underneath heii@xmath184686 .",
    "the far - uv features are the cleanest signatures of recent star formation , but , unfortunately , there are only a handful of seyfert 2 s for which hst far - uv spectroscopy is feasible .",
    "all four galaxies in the sample for which we acquired such data ( mrk 477 , ngc 5135 , ngc 7130 and ic",
    "3639 ) have their far - uv spectrum dominated by young stars . for the remaining galaxies ,",
    "detection of a starburst component relies on either high order balmer lines , which originate in the photosphere of o , b and a stars , or the wr bump , a tracer of very recent ( 36 myr ) star formation .",
    "although more subtle than the far - uv features , these are reliable and more easily accessible indicators of the presence of a starburst .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that either of these two features is also detected in the galaxies for which we have identified stellar wind lines in the far - uv .",
    "the least certain of these diagnostics is the wr bump , because independent evidence of the presence of wr stars is hard to obtain ( gd01 ; shaerer 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this is the simplest interpretation of this feature , given the similarity to the feature sometimes seen in star - forming galaxies ( `` wr galaxies '' ) , the lack of convincing alternatives and the simultaneous detection of other starburst features in some of the sources .",
    "the information to be used in this paper comprises fluxes and equivalent widths ( @xmath19 ) of the [ oii]@xmath203726,3729 , heii@xmath184686 , h@xmath3 and [ oiii]@xmath185007 emission lines ; the @xmath19 s of caiik@xmath183933 ( @xmath21 ) , cn@xmath184200 ( @xmath22 ) and g - band@xmath184301 ( @xmath23 ) absorption bands , the continuum fluxes at 3660 , 4020 and 4510  , as well as the 12 @xmath24 m and far ir luminosities as measured by iras .",
    "these are listed in tables  [ tab : tabelao1 ] and [ tab : tabelao2 ] , along with heliocentric velocities extracted from ned .",
    "table  [ tab : tabelao2 ] also lists the h@xmath25/h@xmath3 ratio for the seyfert 2 sample , mostly compiled from the literature , since the kitt peak spectra do not cover the h@xmath25 region .",
    "these measurements come from spectra obtained with apertures larger than those used in our observations . for this reason , and also because of the intrinsic uncertainties associated with reddening corrections , we will concentrate on reddening insensitive diagnostics inasmuch as possible .",
    "galaxies which had hidden seyfert 1 nuclei revealed through spectropolarimetry are indicated by the corresponding reference in the last column of table  [ tab : tabelao2 ] .    all absorption line @xmath19 s and continuum fluxes used in this paper were measured according to the system explained in cid fernandes ( 1998 ) .",
    "emission line and continuum fluxes were corrected for galactic extinction following the extinction law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 , with @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 values from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) as listed in ned .",

    "these are eso 362-g8 , ic 3639 , mrk 1 , mrk 78 , mrk 273 , mrk 477 , mrk 463e , mrk 533 , mrk 1066 , mrk 1073 , mrk 1210 , ngc 5135 , ngc 5643 , ngc 7130 and ngc 7582 ( observed prior to the type transition reported in aretxaga 1999 ) , which will henceforth be tagged _ composite _ systems .",
    "the circum - nuclear starbursts in these galaxies cover a wide range of properties , from very young bursts still in the wr phase ( e.g. , mrk 477 , mrk 1 ) to more mature systems in a `` post - starburst '' phase with deep high order balmer absorption lines ( e.g. , mrk 78 , eso 362-g8 ) , and systems which have a mixture of both young and intermediate age stars ( e.g. , ngc 5135 , ngc 7130 ) .",
    "the remaining 20 sources will be labeled `` _ pure _ '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "this denomination is used simply to indicate that no clear signs of starburst activity have been detected in our previous studies .",
    "the spectra among our `` pure '' seyfert 2 s vary from galaxies whose optical light is entirely dominated by an old , red stellar population ( e.g. , ngc 1358 and ngc 5929 ) to galaxies which show clear signs of an uv - excess ( e.g. , mrk 3 and mrk 348 ) .",
    "it is nearly impossible to tell on the basis of optical spectra alone whether this fc is associated with scattered light , a starburst or a combination of both .",
    "this point was discussed at length by sb00 , who argue that as many as 30% of seyfert 2 s can fall in this ambiguous category .",
    "gd01 also finds that several galaxies are equally well described in terms of a scattered power - law or a starburst component , depending basically on what is chosen to represent the underlying old stellar population .",
    "far - uv spectroscopy offers the best hope to break this degeneracy , but this is not practical with currently available instrumentation , so we will have to live with this ambiguity for some time . indeed , this ambiguity pervades all discussions in this paper .",
    "we emphasize that the composite and `` pure '' categories are _ not _ meant as new elements in the agn taxonomy .",
    "it is clear that this classification reflects a _",
    "effect , since we define composites as systems in which stars with ages of @xmath32 yr have been conclusively detected .",
    "this definition therefore introduces an inevitable bias towards starbursts that are powerful in contrast with the other components of seyfert 2 spectra , a bias which will become evident in several of the results presented in this paper . while it is likely that some `` pure '' sources eventually be `` up - graded '' to composites with deeper or different observations ( e.g. , when far - uv spectra are obtained , or when near - ir mass to light ratios are measured ) , it is unlikely that any of the composites will ever be reclassified as a `` pure '' seyfert 2 . until such further notice",
    ", all galaxies not in the list of 15 composites above will be designated `` pure '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "the composite/``pure '' classification will be used throughout this paper as a guide to interpret our results , even though we shall _ not _ make explicit use of any of the properties on which this classification is based .",
    "instead , we seek to find where composite sources fit into more general and easily accessible properties of seyfert 2 s .      as comparison samples we draw data from three different observational studies .",
    "the first is the spectroscopy of 61 starburst and narrow line active galaxies ( nlagn ) by storchi - bergmann , kinney & challis ( 1995 ) and mcquade , kinney & calzetti ( 1995 , hereafter collectively referred to as sbmq95 ) .",
    "the starburst galaxies in their study will be referred to as the `` starburst sample '' , which will be extensively used as a benchmark when gauging the results for our seyfert 2 s .",
    "ugca410 was removed from our analysis because of apparently incompatible values of @xmath21 and @xmath23 , leaving a total of 36 starburst galaxies .",
    "the remaining 24 sources in sbmq95 contain a mixture of seyfert 2 s , liners and starburst / agn composites , so we give them a generic denomination of `` nlagn sample '' . in principle",
    "these galaxies serve as a test - bed to evaluate the efficacy of the diagnostics of compositeness developed from our seyfert 2 sample . in practice , we will make limited use of this sample because of the mixed nature of its sources , which complicates the interpretation .",
    "galaxies in the starburst and nlagn samples were observed with very large @xmath33 apertures to match the iue observations , sampling physical scales of typically @xmath341 kpc in radius at the distances of the sources .",
    "a third comparison sample used here is the `` merger sample '' from the study of liu & kennicutt ( 1995a , b , hereafter lk95 ) .",
    "this sample comprises 28 nuclear optical spectra integrated over a region corresponding to @xmath352 kpc in radius .",
    "the emission line properties of these galaxies are quite heterogeneous , comprising 5 seyfert 2 s , 9 hii nuclei and 14 liners .",
    "lutz , veilleux & genzel ( 1999 ) have used iso data to show that ir - luminous galaxies with hii or liner classifications are predominantly powered by starbursts , while dusty agn are energetically significant in those classified as seyfert 2 s .",
    "thus , we will use the merger sample to empirically define the properties of powerful merger - induced dusty starbursts .    the data which will be used from these samples consists of fluxes and @xmath19 s of [ oii ] , h@xmath3 and [ oiii ] ; @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , plus the continuum fluxes at 3660 , 4020 , and 4510   and iras fluxes .",
    "both the sbmq95 and lk95 data offer more information than this , but we shall limit our analysis to the properties above for consistency with the seyfert 2 sample .    fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture_x_wk ] shows the projected aperture radii , defined as @xmath36slit area@xmath37 , against @xmath21 for the seyfert 2 , nlagn , starburst and merger samples .",
    "though the physical region sampled in the comparison samples extend well beyond that covered by the nuclear spectra of the seyfert 2 sample , there is some overlap at small @xmath38 which guarantees the fairness of the comparisons presented in this paper , and in any case aperture effects will be discussed whenever relevant .",
    "[ fig : aperture_x_wk]a also shows that the composite classification is _ not _ related to the physical size of the region sampled by our spectra . in principle",
    "one would expect that systems observed through larger apertures are more prone to exihibit starburst features due to the inclusion of light from off - nuclear star - forming regions .",
    "this effect has been quantified by heckman ( 1995 ) in their analysis of the aperture dependent properties of ngc 1068 , whose 1 kpc ring of hii regions dominates the light for observations taken through kpc - scale apertures .",
    "such rings are in fact rather common ( e.g. , pogge 1989 ; wilson 1991 ; storchi - bergmann , wilson & baldwin 1996 ; colina 1997 ) , and thus can play a role in defining a composite nature for more distant objects , as also discussed by heckman etal ( 1995 ) . if such aperture effects were pronounced in the seyfert 2 sample we would expect composites to be concentrated towards large @xmath38 , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture_x_wk]a shows that composites and `` pure '' seyfert 2 s are similarly distributed as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , most of the apertures for the seyfert 2 sample are much smaller than the 1 kpc typical of star - forming rings .",
    "this effect does not affect the seyfert 2 sample , as our circum - nuclear starbursts are relatively compact ( @xmath34 few hundred pc ) .",
    "these dimensions have in fact been confirmed by hst uv imaging for mrk 477 ( heckman 1997 ) , ngc 5135 , ngc 7130 and ic 3639 ( gonzlez delgado 1998 ) , and are comparable to the inner star - forming structures identified in the circinus galaxy ( wilson 2000 ) .",
    "a further example of how compact circum - nuclear starbursts around agn can be is given in shields ( 2000 ) .",
    "another dataset that will be used in this paper is that of jansen ( 2000 ) .",
    "this sample contains multicolor surface photometry for 198 galaxies , most of which classified as normal .",
    "we used their data to calculate the 3660   surface brightness of these galaxies inside radii of 250 and 500 pc , similar to the apertures used for our galaxies .",
    "these values are used to compare the uv surface brightness of seyfert and normal galaxies .",
    "the 4 seyfert 1 and 1 bl lac in their sample were excluded from our analysis .",
    "determining the fc contribution to the optical spectrum of seyfert 2 s is an important but difficult task , for which there is no definitive recipe .",
    "the traditional and still most widely employed method , which dates back to at least koski ( 1978 ) , is to remove the contribution of the old red stars from the host s bulge by adopting an elliptical or early type spiral normal galaxy as a spectral template .",
    "the spectral decomposition is accomplished by assuming a @xmath39 power - law for the `` non - stellar '' fc , whose strength is then adjusted to minimize the residuals , yielding typically @xmath402 . naturally , this procedure precludes the detection of young stellar populations , whose most conspicuous optical absorption features are masked by emission lines even in starburst galaxies . furthermore , there is no simple way to tell apart a power law fc from that produced by a reddened starburst ( e.g. , cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) . only upon careful scrutiny of high quality spectra",
    "is it possible to discern the presence of a starburst from its high order balmer lines or , sometimes , the wr bump ( see discussion in gd01 ) .",
    "therefore , _ the fc strength will in general include a contribution from young stars as well as a _",
    "bona fide non - stellar fc _ _ , composed of scattered light from the hidden nucleus plus nebular continuum .",
    "`` featureless '' is of course a misnomer for a spectral component at least partly associated with starlight .",
    "we nonetheless retain this terminology both for historical reasons and because to first order a young stellar population does produce weak spectral features in the optical range .",
    "when referring to scattered light from the hidden nucleus we will use the term ` fc1 ' introduced by tran ( 1995c ) . as argued by cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1995 ) , heckman ( 1995 ) and tran ( 1995c ) , strong fc seyfert 2 s must also contain another source of fc photons , ` fc2 ' in tran s notation , to account for the absence of conspicuous broad lines and the larger polarizations observed in the reflected broad lines than in the reflected nuclear continuum .",
    "at least for the composite systems , there is little doubt that fc2 is associated with circum - nuclear starbursts ( see gd01 ) .",
    "nebular continuum and emission from the scattering region itself ( tran 1995c ) are other possible contributors to fc2 .    in this paper",
    "we explore a different way to determine the fc strength .",
    "we decompose the total light into a base of 12 simple stellar population components represented by star clusters spanning the @xmath41 to @xmath42 yr age range and different metallicities ( schmidt 1991 ; bica 1988 ) , plus a @xmath43 power - law to represent fc1 and any other agn component .",
    "this is done by means of a population synthesis analysis similar to that employed by schmitt ( 1999 ) , but performed with the probabilistic formalism described in cid fernandes ( 2001 ) , extended to include the power - law component .",
    "note that this method is analogous , but not technically equivalent to a full spectral decomposition as only a few @xmath19 s and colors are actually synthesized . as input data we use the @xmath19 s of caii",
    "k , cn and g - band , plus the @xmath44 and @xmath45 colors .",
    "the errors on these quantities were set to 0.5   for @xmath21 and @xmath23 , 1   for @xmath22 and 0.05 for the colors ; these errors are consistent with the quality of the spectra , and in any case they do not affect our conclusions . the output is a 13-d population vector @xmath46 which contains the expected values of the fractional contribution of each component to the total light at a reference normalization wavelength . in",
    "what follows we shall use 4861   as our reference wavelength unless noted otherwise .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath46 are also provided by the code .",
    "it is clear from the outset that with so little input information we will not be able to recover all 13 components of @xmath46 accurately , but , as discussed by cid fernandes ( 2001 ) , we may rightfully hope to achieve a coarse yet useful description of the population mixture by grouping similar elements of the population vector . in what follows",
    "we shall make use of only three grouped @xmath46 components : @xmath47 , made up from the sum of all base components with age @xmath48 gyr , @xmath49 , corresponding to the `` post - starburst '' @xmath50 yr intermediate age bin , and , most importantly for our purposes , @xmath51 , containing the total contribution of @xmath52 yr stars plus the power - law component .",
    "these quantities are linked by the @xmath53 normalization constraint , so in practice our method characterizes the spectral mixture in terms of _ 2 parameters_. this bi - parametric description of the data is in many ways analogous to a principal component analysis ( sodr & cuevas 1997 ; rodrigues - lacerda 2001 ) , except that by construction we have _ a priori _ knowledge of the physical meaning of our components .",
    "note that _ we do not attempt to disentangle the starburst and power - law components _ explicitly ; these are merged in @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 stand for the light fractions due to young ( @xmath52 yr ) stars and the power - law respectively . as shown below ,",

    "we have applied it to the spectra in the comparisons samples , which , for consistency , were processed in exactly the same way as our seyfert 2 s .",

    "second , it demonstrates an excellent _ consistency _ between the two techniques , which are based on different observables .",
    "the synthesis process did _ not _ use any of the information used in the original identification of starbursts in these composites , namely , far - uv stellar wind features , high order balmer lines , and/or the wr bump , all of which are much more subtle or hard to obtain than the observables used as input for the synthesis code .",
    "the separation between composites and `` pure '' seyfert 2 s in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_xfc_x_xint]a strongly suggests that , as anticipated in  [ sec : compositesandpureseyfert2s ] , the composite/``pure '' classification is mostly driven by a _ contrast _ effect : systems with circum - nuclear starbursts residing in galaxies where the old stellar population dominates the spectrum would simply not be recognized as composite systems .",
    "this contrast effect is nicely quantified by the value of @xmath47 , which can therefore be read as a measure of the difficulty to detect any non - trivial spectral component and to interpret its origin .",
    "[ fig : fig_xfc_x_xint ] shows that our current techniques establish a threshold of @xmath69 , beyond which we are not able to recognize circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "for instance , if we scale down the circum - nuclear starburst in ic 3639 by a factor @xmath70 , it would move from @xmath71 to more than 82% , where , judging by fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_xfc_x_xint ] , we would classify it as a `` pure '' seyfert 2 .",
    "it is therefore likely that at least some `` pure '' seyfert 2 s are just that : composites with weak starbursts .",
    "the presence of strong hi emission lines introduces another contrast effect , since they dilute the high order balmer absorption lines , thus hindering the use of this diagnostic of starbursts .",
    "therefore _ the combination of strong emission lines and a large @xmath47 is highly unfavorable to the detection of circum - nuclear - starbursts_. we will return to this issue in  [ sec : difficulty_to_detect_starbursts ] , after we analyze the emission line data .    besides the contrast between the starburst and the underlying old stellar population , _ evolution _ is the main property defining the location of a source in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_xfc_x_xint ] .",
    "one can easily imagine an evolutionary sequence which starts at some large value of @xmath51 in the bottom right part of the diagram , with massive young starts dominating the spectrum and no intermediate age population , and gradually moves towards large @xmath72 ( i.e. , to the top left of the diagram ) on @xmath67 yr time scales .",
    "the exact shape of evolutionary tracks in our @xmath62 diagram is dictated by the detailed star - formation history , but for the purposes of the qualitative discussion below one can imagine that such tracks broadly follow the dotted lines traced in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig_xfc_x_xint]a ) .",
    "these are precisely the 4 systems where we have identified wr stars ( heckman 1997 ; storchi - bergmann 1998 ; gd01 ) , signposts of very recent star - formation .",
    "they therefore rank as the youngest circum - nuclear starbursts among our composites , in agreement with their location in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_xfc_x_xint]a . at the other extreme ,",
    "the three composites with @xmath74 are ngc 5643 , mrk 78 and eso 362-g8 , all of which present spectroscopic signatures of a dominant ` post - starburst ' population ( schmitt 1999 ; sb00 ; gd01 ) , and rank as our oldest composites , in agreement with the large @xmath49 but small @xmath51 we obtain . given this agreement at the young and old ends of a starburst evolutionary sequence",
    ", we would expect that systems located at @xmath73 values in between these extremes present a mixture of young and intermediate age stars .",
    "this is indeed the case . the cluster of 4 composites towards the top right in fig .",

    "what makes this agreement remarkable is the fact that while the characterization of the starburst component in our earlier work involved a detailed spectroscopic analysis , the synthesis performed here used just three @xmath19 s of metallic absorption bands plus a couple of near - uv colors .",
    "our quicker and cheaper method is therefore not only able to recognize composite systems from a handful of easily measured observables , but it allows us to go one step further to provide a rough description of evolutionary state of the starburst component .",
    "we will return to the issue of evolution in  [ sec : discussion ] . before that",
    ", we have to deal with the contribution of the non - stellar fc in @xmath51 .",
    "this issue was deliberately omitted from the discussion above because we do _ not _ have a recipe to separate the stellar and non - stellar parts of the fc , neither do we know how or whether the non - stellar fc evolves on time - scales comparable to the starburst lifetime .",
    "these difficulties limit considerations about evolution to composites alone , for which we know that the starburst component is the dominant contributor to the fc .",
    "our inability to disentangle the starburst and non - stellar components of the fc is currently the major obstacle to a full characterization of the starburst - agn connection in seyfert 2 s .",
    "unfortunately , these are also the most relevant spectral components in seyfert 2 s . the starburst portion of @xmath51 traces the ongoing star - formation , being therefore associated with young massive stars which may have a significant impact on the ionization of the gas in the circum - nuclear environment . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - stellar component ( which is presumably mainly scattered light , i.e. , fc1 ) is the only continuum feature associated with the agn in these galaxies . for these reasons we concentrate on the fc component throughout most of the rest of this paper .",
    "whereas little can be said about the starburst and agn shares of @xmath51 in `` pure '' seyfert 2 s , composite systems have their fc dominated by the starburst ( gd01 ; sb00 ) , and hence provide a useful guide as to what can be deduced from the fc strength alone .",
    "table  [ tab : synthesis ] shows that strong fc sources ( @xmath75 ) are likely to be composite systems . within the context of the unified model",
    ", it is not surprising to find that a starburst component dominates over fc1 whenever the total fc is strong , since scattered light can not exceed a fraction of @xmath76 , otherwise reflected broad lines should become easily discernible in the direct spectrum and the galaxy would no longer be classified as a type 2 seyfert . for a typical @xmath19 of @xmath77   for broad h@xmath3 in seyfert 1 s",
    "( goodrich 1989 ; binette , fosbury & parker 1993 ) , more than @xmath78 scattered light would imply a broad h@xmath3 stronger than 30   in the direct total spectrum .",
    "cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1995 ) argue that broad lines should be seen even for smaller @xmath79 , but we figure 30% is a reasonable limit in practice because ngc 1068 has @xmath80 , and broad lines have not been conclusively detected there without the hindsight of spectropolarimetry to guide the eye ( miller & goodrich 1990 ; tran 1995b ; malkan & filippenko 1983 ) .    in support of this conclusion , we note that several cases of strong fc sources reported in the literature turned out to harbor starbursts not accounted for in the classical starlight template decomposition .",
    "for instance , miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) find @xmath81 in mrk 463e , while gd01 suggest it actually contains a powerful starburst in the wr phase .",
    "the same can be said about mrk 477 , for which tran ( 1995a , b ) finds @xmath82 at 5500  , and mrk 1066 , for which miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) find a 72% fc at 5300  . even in cygnus",
    "a , whose blue fc has remained a mystery for more than a decade ( e.g. , goodrich & miller 1989 ; tadhunter , scarrott & rolph 1990 ) , there now seems to be evidence for young stars ( fosbury 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , inspection of the keck spectrum in ogle ( 1997 ) even indicates the presence of a possible wr bump ! this is consistent with our conclusion , since estimates of the fc strength for cygnus a place it above the 30% level ( osterbrock 1983 ) .",
    "this high `` success''-rate suggests that one can _ predict _ the existence of circum - nuclear starbursts based only on the fc strength . despite the non uniformity of fc estimation methods , one can be fairly confident that a search for sources with @xmath83 reported in the literature should identify other composite systems .",
    "kay ( 1994 ) , for instance , reports the following seyfert 2 s with an fc stronger than 30% at 4400  : mrk 266sw ( 30% ) , mrk 1388 ( 45% ) , ngc 591 ( 46% ) , ngc 1410 ( 38% ) , ngc 1685 ( 38% ) , ngc 4922b ( 53% ) , ngc 7319 ( 35% ) , ngc 7682 ( 30% ) .",
    "koski ( 1978 ) finds a 34% fc at 4861   for 3c184.1 and 35% for mrk 198 .",
    "evidence for young and intermediate age stars in the spectra of mrk266sw was reported by wang ( 1997 ) . according to gonalves , vron - cetty & vron ( 1999 )",
    ", this galaxy also has a composite emission line spectrum , with emission line ratios intermediate between those of seyferts and starbursts .",
    "the same description is given for the interacting galaxy ngc 4922b by alonso - herrero ( 1999 ) .",
    "we could not find information regarding the compositeness or otherwise of the remaining galaxies .",
    "our prediction is that most of them should present detectable signatures of circum - nuclear starburst activity .",
    "while all @xmath84 sources are composites , _ the converse is not true_. for ic 3639 , a galaxy whose composite nature has been conclusively established by both optical and uv spectroscopy , we find a 16% fc .",
    "the range between 15 and 30% also contains 4 `` pure '' seyfert 2 nuclei : ngc 1068 , mrk 3 , ngc 7212 and mrk 34 .",
    "ngc 1068 is sometimes listed as an example of a starburst - agn link because of its bright ring of hii regions at @xmath85 kpc from the nucleus , which contributes roughly half of the bolometric ( ir ) luminosity of this prototype seyfert 2 ( telesco 1984 ; lester 1987 ) .",
    "if observed from further away , the ring would dominate the optical spectrum , imprinting signatures which would cast distant ngc 1068 s in the composite category ( heckman 1995 ; colina 1997 ) , but , as argued in  [ sec : sample ] , this is not the effect behind the starburst features identified in our composites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture_x_wk ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 1068 analyzed here pertains to a much smaller region , corresponding to @xmath86 pc .",
    "the only indications of star - formation within this central region are the strong caii triplet at @xmath87   ( terlevich , daz & terlevich 1990 ) and the small @xmath88 ratio at 1.6@xmath24 m ( oliva 1995 , 1999 ) , both of which point to an intermediate - age population , qualitatively consistent with the @xmath89 found in our synthesis",
    ". there does not seem to be substantial ongoing star - formation associated with this `` post - starburst '' population , since neither far - uv ( caganof 1991 ) nor optical ( gd01 ; miller & antonucci 1983 ) spectroscopy reveal signs of young stars close to the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , from the work of antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) , miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) and tran ( 1995c ) we know that ngc 1068 does _ not _ suffer from the `` fc2-syndrome '' ( lower polarization in the continuum than in the broad lines ) , so most , if not all , of its nuclear fc is indeed fc1 . since our @xmath51 estimate is in fair agreement with previous determinations ( e.g. , the 22 % at 4600 found by miller & antonucci 1983 and the 16% at 5500   derived by tran 1995 ) , there is little doubt that @xmath90 in the central region of ngc 1068 . we therefore keep ngc 1068 in the `` pure '' seyfert 2 category .",
    "the nature of the fc is not so clear for the 3 other moderate fc `` pure '' seyfert 2 s in our sample : mrk 3 , ngc 7212 and mrk 34 . in their detailed analysis of the same data used here",
    ", gd01 find that the dilution of the metal absorption lines in these galaxies is better modeled by an elliptical galaxy plus power - law spectral decomposition than using an off - nuclear template , which , together with the lack of starburst features , lead them to favor a scattered light origin for their fc .",
    "the extended blue continuum aligned with the radio axis and ionization cone in mrk 3 ( pogge & de robertis 1993 ) supports this idea .",
    "kotilainen & ward ( 1997 ) find a similar feature in ngc 7212 , though not aligned along the [ oiii ] emission .",
    "these indications of a fc1 component are confirmed by the spectropolarimetry observations of tran ( 1995a , b , c ) , which revealed their hidden seyfert 1 nuclei .",
    "however , tran also finds that mrk 3 and ngc 7212 suffer from acute `` fc2-itus '' ! according to his analysis , only 4% ( mrk 3 ) and 2% ( ngc 7212 ) of the flux at 5500   is attributable to fc1 ; the rest of their fc is ` fc2 ' !",
    "the total fc = fc1 + fc2 fractions at 5500 found by tran are 12% for mrk 3 and 17% for ngc 7212 , which are in very good agreement with our estimates of @xmath51 when translated to the same wavelength .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of their polarization spectra , most of their fc still have to be explained .",
    "below @xmath91 we therefore enter a `` gray zone '' : the power - law / starburst degeneracy sets in and the identity of the fc becomes ambiguous .",
    "extra information ( spectropolarimetry , uv spectroscopy , imaging ) may help disentangling these two components in a few sources , but the situation becomes even fuzzier for weak fc sources ( @xmath92 ) .",

    "in fact , the excitation of the broad component ( mean [ oiii]/h@xmath169 , standard deviation @xmath170 ) is very similar to the excitation of `` pure '' seyfert 2 s .",

    "meanwhile , the excitation in mrk 1066 , mrk 1073 , ngc 5135 , ngc 7130 and ic 3639 is similar to the excitation in prototypical nuclear starbursts ( e.g.  ngc 7714 , gonzlez - delgado 1995 ) , while in mrk 1 , mrk 463e , mrk 477 and mrk 533 the excitation is higher and similar to the excitation in young and very highly excited hii regions ( e.g.  ngc 2363 , gonzlez - delgado 1994 ) .",
    "the difference in excitation between these two sub - groups within the composites is suggestive of evolutionary effects , where the youngest systems are the ones with highest excitation .",
    "this is consistent with other properties of composites , such as @xmath102 , the fraction of total optical light provided by intermediate and young stars ( @xmath72 ) , and the detection of wolf - rayet features ( see  [ sec : evolution ] ) .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , i.e. , the narrow and broad emission line components are produced by the starburst and agn respectively , the ratio of the narrow to total line flux gives an estimate of the starburst contribution to the ionization of the gas .",

    "we do this by contrasting two extreme views on the origin of the fc in `` pure '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "since we have established that circum - nuclear starbursts make substantial contributions both to the fc and h@xmath3 emission , and given that these two quantities are causally linked in starburst systems , _ the presence of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s naturally leads to a h@xmath3-fc correlation_. even if the agn components of @xmath116 and @xmath114 are uncorrelated , the starburst portions should suffice to maintain a h@xmath3-fc correlation in the combined agn @xmath0 starburst data .    one extreme interpretation of fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_and_o2_x_fc]a is thus that the h@xmath3-fc correlation is essentially driven by the presence of circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "if this is to apply to _ all _ sources , the fc must be dominated by the starburst _ even in `` pure '' seyfert 2s_. varying proportions of starburst to agn ionizing power can be invoked to account for the few `` pure '' seyfert 2 s whose h@xmath3/fc ratios exceed the maximum @xmath172   reached by composites .",
    "this can be explained either by scaling up the nuclear ionizing source , thus increasing @xmath114 while keeping @xmath116 constant , or by scaling down the starburst , which also increases @xmath102 since @xmath116 would be more affected than @xmath114 .",
    "such adjustments can even be dispensed with if one allows for differential extinction to the line and fc , since we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_x_fc_reddening]b that this alone substantially reduces the @xmath102 differences between composite and `` pure '' systems .    but how do the [ oiii ] ( fig .",

    "such a scatter is in fact expected in a starburst dominated fc model , since the [ oiii ] and ( especially ) the heii line fluxes trace the agn power , whereas @xmath116 is a measure of the starburst power , so that @xmath104}$ ] and @xmath174 are indicators of the varying contrast between these components .",

    ", i.e. , that more powerful starbursts occur in more powerful agn ! further evidence for this scaling is presented in  [ sec : iras ] ,  [ sec : luminosity_connection ] and gd01 .",
    "an opposite model would be to postulate that the fc is dominated by starbursts _ only _ in composites , while in `` pure '' seyfert 2 s the fc is dominated by scattered light , so these two classes should not be mixed when discussing line - fc relations .",
    "this interpretation would lead us to the intriguing conclusion that the scattering efficiency , @xmath175 , which links the observed fc1 to the intrinsic nuclear fc via @xmath176 , does not vary substantially among seyfert 2 s .",
    "the surprise comes from the fact that @xmath175 depends on the geometry of the mirror and the optical depth of scattering particles ( miller , goodrich & mathews 1991 ; cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "since there is no _ a priori _ reason why @xmath175 should be similar for all seyfert 2 s , we would expect a _ wide spread _ of @xmath105 s , contrary to the relatively narrow ranges observed , particularly if composites are excluded .",
    "this argument has in fact been pursued by mulchaey ( 1994 ) to explain the _ absence _ of line - fc correlations in their data , from which they claim a consistency with the unified model . as acknowledged by mulchaey etal .",
    ", however , it is possible that , just as we find here , a substantial part of the scatter in their line - fc plots is associated with contamination by starburst activity . that this is more than a possibility is illustrated by the fact that the seyfert 2 list of mulchaey ( 1994 ) includes 12 of our 15 composites !",
    "it also includes other prime composite suspects , most notably ngc 6221 , a source for which levenson ( 2001b ) find a complete dominance of the starburst , with the agn shining through only in hard x - rays . as a whole ,",
    "their sample is similar to the nlagn sample of sbmq95 in terms of the mixed types of sources . indeed , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : hb_and_o2_x_fc]b , d and [ fig : he2_and_o3_x_fc]b , no line - fc correlations are present for this heterogeneous sample . furthermore , contamination by starbursts is certainly larger in the mulchaey data than in ours , since they trace the fc by the far - uv flux collected through the large aperture of the iue spectrometer , a procedure which follows the premise that starlight contamination is irrelevant in the uv .",
    "this premise was proven wrong by heckman ( 1995 ) , who have demonstrated that , on the contrary , scattered light from a hidden seyfert 1 is a minor contributor to the iue spectra of seyfert 2 s , which are more typical of reddened starbursts .    at least in relative terms",
    ", it is clear that our observations are better suited to investigate line - fc relations .",
    "our results essentially recover the classic yee ( 1980 ) and shuder ( 1981 ) correlation between line and fc luminosity , which extends over more than 5 decades in luminosity from seyfert 2 s to qsos .",
    "looking at their original plots one sees that seyfert 2 s show a larger scatter around the correlations than type 1 sources , but they still broadly follow the correlations . while it is true that the interpretation of their line - fc correlations was left orphan with the advent of the unified model , their reality has not been convincingly challenged as yet .",
    "similarly , barring unidentified selection effects , it is hard to deny the reality of the line - fc correlations seen in figs .",

    "observationally , the narrow h@xmath3 in seyfert 1 s roughly spans the range between @xmath180 to 75   ( goodrich 1989 ; rodrguez - ardila , pastoriza & donzelli 2000 ) .",
    "this spread is already comparable to the @xmath181   interval span by `` pure '' seyfert 2 s in our sample , which does not leave much room for a spread in @xmath175 . combining these intervals we obtain an acceptable range for @xmath175 of roughly 0.010.1 .",

    "a `` well behaved ''",
    "@xmath175 is thus required in order to explain the h@xmath3-fc correlation for `` pure '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "this interpretation is analogous to , and just as puzzling as , the interpretation of the constancy of the @xmath19 of broad h@xmath3 among type 1 seyferts and qsos as due to a roughly constant covering fraction of broad line clouds in all sources ( yee 1980 ; shuder 1981 ; osterbrock 1989 ; binette 1993 ) . while viable , this model obviously requires some fine tuning .",
    "yet another possibility is that the fc carries a sizable _ nebular _ component in `` pure '' seyfert 2 s , which would naturally produce line - fc correlations .",
    "a purely nebular fc , however , would produce @xmath102 of order 2000   for electron temperatures between 10000 and 20000 k , much larger than the values we find .",
    "a hotter plasma , however , can enhance the continuum emission and lower the @xmath105 s .",
    "this is the essence of tran s ( 1995c ) model for fc2 : emission from the @xmath183 k electron - scattering mirror . if this emission is somehow tied to the line emission  which is reasonable since both arise in circum - nuclear gas heated by the active nucleus  then a line - fc correlation follows .",
    "while our personal prejudices tend to favor a starburst - dominated fc interpretation , we are not in a position to rule out a role for a non - stellar fc for `` pure '' seyfert 2 s . indeed ,",
    "the fact that ngc 1068 mingles so well among composite starburst / seyfert 2 s is a clear demonstration that our analysis can not resolve the ambiguous nature of the fc in `` pure '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "since we know that several composites have a scattered component ( table  [ tab : tabelao2 ] ) , the correct interpretation of the line - fc relation will certainly involve a mixture of the extreme possibilities discussed above .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : hb_and_o2_x_fc][fig : hb_x_fc_reddening ] we have seen that , besides having smaller emission line @xmath105 s , the tendency of composites to live preferentially among luminous sources allows them to be more clearly separated from `` pure '' seyfert2 s in line - fc diagrams . to evaluate this tendency in a reddening independent fashion , fig .",

    "ir luminous galaxies have a well know preference to be interacting systems ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "[ fig : iras]a therefore suggests that interactions and the associated gas fueling of the nuclear regions may be a key ingredient in triggering circum - nuclear starbursts in agn .",
    "indeed , a substantial fraction of our composites ( 9 of 15 ) are associated with interacting systems or groups ( gd01 ; levenson 2001a ; sb00 ) : ngc 7130 , mrk 1 , mrk 273 , mrk 463e , mrk 477 , mrk 533 and ic 3639 are all in interacting systems , while ngc 5135 and ngc 7582 belong to groups .",

    "comparison of the top and bottom panels shows that seyfert 2 s have @xmath190 ratios larger than galaxies in the starburst sample , but compatible with the lk95 mergers . despite the mixed emission line properties of the sources in the merger sample , it is reasonable to attribute most of their fir and fc emission to star - formation in a dusty environment ( lutz 1999 ; 1998 ) .",
    "this similarity is thus suggestive of the presence of powerful dusty circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s , consistent with our knowledge of composites .",
    "a usual caveat when dealing with iras fluxes is that one has to allow for the fact that a substantial fraction of the far ir light originates well outside the nuclear region .",
    "aperture effects may therefore be partially responsible for the larger @xmath190 found for objects in the seyfert 2 than in the starburst sample .",
    "this effect was detected for sources in common between the seyfert 2 and nlagn samples , the latter having systematically larger @xmath187 and thus smaller @xmath190 . at any rate",

    "indeed , the hst imaging survey by malkan , gorjian & tam ( 1998 ) reveals a significant number of seyfert 2 s ( including some of our composites ) in which the hst - based hubble type is much later than that assigned from earlier ground - based images ( storchi - bergmann 2001 )",
    ". could it be that the seyfert 2 composites are simply otherwise normal late - type galaxies containing an agn ? the abnormally large far - ir luminosities of the composites argues against this . in this section",
    "we also show that the observed uv surface - brightnesses of the seyfert 2 composite nuclei are much larger than the nuclei of normal galaxies ( of any hubble type ) , but rather similar to typical starbursts .",
    "we have compared the surface brightnesses in the near uv ( @xmath191  ) of all our seyfert 2 s with those of normal galactic nuclei based on the imaging data published by jansen ( 2000 ) . for the normal nuclei ( spanning the full range of hubble types )",

    "the seyfert 2 composites have tend to have higher central uv surface - brightness than the `` pure '' seyfert 2 s ( by an average factor of about 2 ) . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbu2 ] , the difference between the two classes is larger ( factor of @xmath34 4 ) when an extinction correction is made .",
    "fourth , the `` pure '' seyfert 2 s overlap with the normal galactic nuclei having the highest uv surface brightnesses .",
    "these latter tend to be the nuclei of normal early - type ( sb and earlier ) galaxies whose high uv surface brightness is due to their prominent bulge component .",
    "this is consistent with `` pure '' seyfert 2 s being otherwise normal early - type galaxies with only a modest contribution of light from an agn or young stars ( as shown by our spectral synthesis ) .",
    "note that the outlying seyfert 2 with extremely high surface brightness is the nucleus of ngc 1068 ( due to the small physical size of the spectroscopic aperture and the strong contribution by scattered agn light ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : sbu2 ] also shows the expected trend between increasing uv surface brightness and an increasing relative contribution to the near - uv light by young and intermediate - age stars ( as parameterized by @xmath21 ) .",

    "the following empirical criteria can be used to characterize a seyfert 2 nucleus as composite :    1",
    ".   weak ca ii k : @xmath1  . or , equivalently , a small contribution of old stars : @xmath192 .",
    "2 .   weak emission lines with respect to the fc : @xmath193  , @xmath104 } < 2500 $ ]  , @xmath112 } < 600 $ ]  . 3 .",

    "large far - ir luminosity : @xmath194 l@xmath5 .",
    "5 .   composite line profiles , with a narrow component typical of hii - nuclei and a broader one with nlr - like excitation . 6 .",
    "high near - uv surface - brightnesses on circum - nuclear scales : @xmath195 l@xmath7 pc@xmath8 uncorrected for extinction and @xmath196 l@xmath7 pc@xmath8 after extinction correction .",
    "these criteria are laid roughly in order of importance , the ca ii k ( or @xmath47 ) limit being by far the most useful . the upper limits for the @xmath105 s and emission line - ratios quoted above were chosen as to encompass all composites in our sample , most of which have substantially smaller values than those listed above .",
    "as argued above , one can not base a classification on these properties alone , but they are useful to confirm the compositeness for sources satisfying the first criterion .",
    "taken together , these empirical rules separate composite from `` pure '' systems very efficiently .    naturally , there are border line cases .",
    "the moderate fc ( @xmath197 ) galaxies mrk 3 , mrk 34 and ngc 7212 , which we discussed in  [ sec : moderate_and_weak_fc_sources ] , lie either within or close to the limits outlined above .",

    "note , however , that these high @xmath105 s , coupled with the dominant contribution of old stars ( @xmath199 ) are precisely the conditions under which the identification of starburst features are most difficult (  [ sec : difficulty_to_detect_starbursts ] ) , so we can not rule out the possibility that their fc is dominated by relatively weak circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "the other moderate fc source in our sample is ngc 1068 , for which there is overwhelming evidence that the nuclear optical fc is predominantly scattered agn light .",
    "the similarities between this prototype seyfert 2 and our composites , whose fc are dominated by starbursts , is a reminder of how similar starbursts and agn can be , and a demonstration of the limitations of our diagnostics for border line cases .",
    "overall , the empirical criteria listed above fulfill our objective of delineating a region in a space of easily obtained observables which can be used to indirectly infer the presence of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s .",
    "we therefore anticipate that their application to large samples of near - uv spectra will reveal many more composite systems .",
    "in fact , since these criteria mix several kinds of properties , it is not at all obvious whether they will hold for larger samples . future applications of these diagnostics will therefore not only serve as a means of identifying composite candidates but to verify the consistency of the scheme as a whole .",
    "it will also be interesting to incorporate other multi - wavelength data in order to help disentagling the starburst and agn components .",
    "valuable tools in this sense were developed for the ir part of the spectrum by miley , neugebauer & soifer ( 1985 ) , lutz ( 1998 ) , genzel & cesarsky ( 2000 ) , laurent ( 2000 ) and hill ( 1999 , 2001 ) , among others . in the radio part of the spectrum ,",

    "we have shown that starburst / seyfert 2 composites have large h@xmath3 , fc and far ir luminosities within our sample .",
    "these are all quantities which may carry a significant , even dominant contribution from the starburst itself . in order to investigate whether these powerful starbursts are associated with correspondingly powerful agn",
    "we compared the [ oiii ] , heii and 12 @xmath24 m luminosities of composites and pure seyfert 2 s .",
    "these properties are less affected by the starburst component and thus provide an empirical measure of the agn intensity .",
    "we find that composites are also skewed towards large luminosities in all these properties .",
    "for instance , 53% of the sources above but just 31% of those below the median reddening - corrected @xmath201}$ ] of @xmath202 erg@xmath15s@xmath17 are composites .",
    "nearly identical numbers apply to @xmath203 , while for @xmath204 , which arguably measures the hot dust heated by the agn ( pier & krolik 1992 ; spinoglio & malkan 1989 ) , the composite percentages are 65 and 25% above and below the median respectively .",

    "the corresponding numbers for @xmath185 are 71 and 19% .",
    "circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s , at least those we can detect , are therefore powerful ( bolometric luminosities of @xmath206 l@xmath7 , judging by @xmath185 ) , and surround correspondingly powerful agn .",

    "perhaps the starburst activity stirs up the ism in a way which induces a large rate of gas accretion by the central super - massive black - hole ( colina & wada 2000 ) , while less powerful agn can be feed with more modest accretion rates , dispensing the helping hand of a circum - nuclear starburst . while feasible ,",
    "this does not seem to be the only mechanism to produce powerful agn , since there are also some high luminosity `` pure '' seyfert 2 s in our sample . or perhaps the `` @xmath207 '' relation extends all over the @xmath208 spectrum , but is only detected for the most luminous agn because of our difficulties to identify weak circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "whatever the correct interpretation , our results strongly suggest that powerful seyfert 2 s have at least a 1 in 2 chance of harboring detectable circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "prediction _ can be readily tested by applying the diagnostics developed in this and our previous work to near - uv spectra of such systems , some of which have luminosities rivaling those of quasars ( de grijp 1992 ) .",
    "extending the starburst - agn connection studies towards the low luminosity end , on the other hand , will require alternative techniques .",
    "high spatial resolution ( i.e. , hst ) near - uv spectroscopy offers the best hope of maximizing the contribution of circum - nuclear star - forming regions with respect to the old stellar population background . this technique was recently applied to the liner ngc 3507 by shields ( 2000 ) , where young stars previously undetected from the ground were clearly revealed with hst .",
    "the composite _ vs.",
    "_ `` pure '' seyfert 2 classification which runs throughout this paper does not necessarily reflect an intrinsic dichotomy among type 2 seyferts . in the spirit of unification , one would rather prefer to look at these two classes as representing extremes of a continuous distribution of some underlying physical parameter .",
    "this view is warranted by the continuity and overlap in observed properties between composites and `` pure '' seyfert 2 s found in this and other studies ( levenson 2001a ; veilleux 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "at least two ingredients must be involved in any physical description of a starburst - agn connection , one of which is some measure of the relative starburst to agn intensities , such as the ratio of star - formation to accretion rate , or the black - hole to stellar mass ratio . of the properties investigated in this paper the @xmath105 s , mainly of [ oiii ] and heii , and the excitation ratios [ oiii]/h@xmath3 and heii / h@xmath3 are in principle the ones",
    "more closely associated with this `` starburst - to - agn ratio '' .",
    "the fact that as a whole `` pure '' seyfert 2 s behave more like agn in terms of these indicators than composites is thus consistent with them having a smaller starburst - to - agn ratio . the strongest contrast effect , however , is between the starburst and old stellar population , as deduced from the fact that _ all _ composites but only one `` pure '' seyfert 2 have @xmath192 , a limit which can be expressed in a more empirical way by @xmath1  .",
    "the ca ii k line originates in bulge stars , being neither a tracer of starburst nor agn activity , so this threshold is clearly an observational limitation which prevents us from identifying circum - nuclear starbursts not powerful enough to dilute @xmath21 below 10  .",
    "the `` pure '' category ought to contain at least some such systems , and in fact several `` pure '' seyfert 2 s in our sample , particularly the less luminous ones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_and_o2_x_fc ] ) , have @xmath105 s and excitation ratios within the range spanned by composites .",
    "the other ingredient is _",
    "evolution_. the combination of starburst - to - agn ratios and evolution can in principle account for the whole range between composite and `` pure '' systems . while our coarse , 3-component population synthesis analysis does not provide a detailed description of the evolutionary history of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s , in  [ sec : constrast_and_evolution ] we have seen that the relative strengths of @xmath51 and @xmath49 in composites bear a very good correspondence with the evolutionary status deduced from a much more detailed spectral analysis ( sb00 ; gd01 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath209 can thus be used as an empirical measure of the time elapsed since the onset of star - formation , allowing us to broadly assess evolutionary trends in the data .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] shows that younger systems have stronger h@xmath3 , heii and [ oiii ] emission lines , which we tentatively interpret as evidence for evolutionary effects .",
    "only composites are plotted , since only for them we can safely interpret the fc component as due to young stars and hence read @xmath73 as an age indicator .",
    "also , note that @xmath19 s in this figure are measured with respect to the whole `` starburst flux '' @xmath210 .",
    "this choice of normalization facilitates the comparison with spectral evolution models such as starburst99 ( leitherer 1999 ) , particularly for systems undergoing star - formation over a period of order @xmath50 yr . since h@xmath3 contains a strong contribution from gas ionized by the starburst , fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution]a roughly traces the evolution of the starburst .",
    "the heii and [ oiii ] to @xmath187 ratios , on the other hand , are measures of the relative power of the agn and the starburst , and so fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution]b and c can be used to assess the evolution of the agn with respect to that of the starburst .    as two extremes , we consider both an instantaneous burst and constant star - formation to describe the starburst . in the former case ,",
    "the optical continuum due to the young stars peaks in luminosity about 3 myr after the burst , and then fades by a factor of 3 by 10 myr and by another factor of 10 by 50 myr .",
    "the systematic decrease in @xmath211 and @xmath212}$ ] in the more evolved starbursts would therefore require that the agn fades more rapidly than this . in this instantaneous burst scenario",
    ", the agn lifetime must be very short in the composite seyfert 2 s ( @xmath213 few @xmath214 years ) . since the agn should disappear before the intermediate - age stars",
    ", the descendants of the seyfert 2 nuclei would be part of the post - starburst population ( the `` e+a '' galaxies ) .",
    "thus , the only plausible evolutionary link between the composite and `` pure '' seyfert 2 s would seemingly require that latter are the evolutionary _ precursors _ to the former .",
    "this does not seem physically appealing , among other reasons , because the agn s in the `` pure '' seyfert 2 s are significantly less powerful on - average than in their supposed descendants ( the youngest composites ) .",
    "moreover , an instantaneous burst description is clearly not appropriate for sources like ngc 5135 and ngc 7130 , which contain a mix of young and intermediate age stars .",
    "alternatively , we can consider a more long - lived ( @xmath215 years ) event in which the star - formation remains roughly constant .",
    "the @xmath157 values predicted by starburst 99 for constant star formation vary from 150450 to 1060   between 0 and @xmath50 yr for different initial mass functions and solar metallicity .",
    "this range covers the values in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution]a .",
    "the @xmath216-fold decrease in @xmath157 during this period is also in agreement with the data . in this model",
    ", the luminosity of the optical continuum steadily grows with time ( e.g. by a factor of 3 to 4 between 10 and 300 myr after the start of the burst ) . the systematic decrease in @xmath211 and @xmath217 in the more evolved starbursts",
    "would therefore imply that the agn s luminosity remains relatively constant over this time - scale .",
    "long time - scale bursts are indeed seen in pure starburst galaxies , where ground based spectra usually integrate over regions containing several young , but non - coeval , super - associations ( meurer 1995 ; gonzlez delgado 1999 ; lanon 2001 ) .",
    "individual starburst knots have been identified in some of our composites ( gonzlez delgado 1998 ) , so we expect this averaging effect to happen in seyfert 2 s too . in this scenario ,",
    "both the starburst and agn are relatively long - lived , and the agn could well outlive the starburst . as the star - formation ceases , the starburst will fade first in h@xmath3 , then in the optical continuum , eventually reaching the point where only scattered fc and agn - powered lines survive . with the drop in the starburst - continuum",
    "the fc becomes weaker and @xmath21 less diluted .",
    "galaxies like eso 362-g8 , ngc 5643 and mrk 78 , with their weak fc but pronounced post - starburst populations may represent this intermediate stage .",
    "[ oiii ] and heii will be much less affected than h@xmath3 by the death of massive stars , so excitation ratios will go up .",
    "starburst - heated dust emission will subside , decreasing @xmath185 .",
    "all these suggest that composites will end up as `` pure '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "clearly , the above is quite speculative . eventually , it may be possible to test these ideas empirically with improved age dating techniques which will allow us to evolve detected starbursts back and forth in time and thus to evaluate whether the age of circum - nuclear starbursts may be used as a clock for nuclear activity . as in any other astrophysical context where evolution is important ,",
    "statistically significant samples will be necessary to trace all relevant stages .",
    "we have examined a sample of 35 galaxies previously studied in a series of papers which addressed the occurrence of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s and implications for the `` starburst - agn connection '' . the detailed spectral analysis performed in these previous papers",
    "was used to classify the nuclei into 15 composite and 20 `` pure '' seyfert 2 s , with composites defined as nuclei in which large populations of stars with ages of @xmath41@xmath50 yr have been conclusively detected either through uv stellar winds features , high order balmer absorption lines in the near uv or the wr bump . using this classification as a guide",
    ", we investigated continuum colors , absorption line equivalent widths , emission line properties , far - ir luminosities and near - uv surface brightnesses for the sample galaxies and comparison samples of normal and starburst galaxies , with the primary goal of verifying whether these properties reflect the presence or otherwise of circum - nuclear starbursts . since this consistency was verified , these properties , all of which are more easily measured than those originally used to detect these starbursts , offer alternative empirical diagnostics of compositeness which can be applied to larger and more distant samples .",
    "* we have applied a semi - empirical population synthesis method which effectively provides a bi - parametric description of each galaxy in terms of old ( @xmath218 yr ) , post - starburst ( @xmath50 yr ) populations and a `` featureless continuum '' which represent the combined contribution of @xmath52 yr stars and a non - stellar fc .",
    "in practice , this representation requires little more than the equivalent width of the ca ii k line , and empirical calibrations were presented which allow an estimation of the ( @xmath219 ) vector from @xmath21 and the @xmath220 color , both easy to measure observables .",
    "this very simple scheme proved instrumental in unveiling a number of properties and gives results which are consistent with a more detailed spectral analysis of the stellar population mixture . * _ all _ starburst / seyfert 2 composites but _ only one _ `` pure '' seyfert 2 ( ngc 1068 ) have @xmath61 at 4861  .",
    "this threshold can be expressed in a more empirical way by @xmath1  . given that our operational definition of composite/``pure '' systems is based on the detection or otherwise of stellar features from massive stars ,",
    "the most natural interpretation for this result is that it is due to a _ contrast _ effect : seyfert 2 s whose circum - nuclear starbursts are overwhelmed by the light from the old stars in the host galaxy are not recognized as composite systems .",
    "at least some `` pure '' seyfert 2 s must fit this description , i.e. , composites with weak starbursts .",
    "this may in fact apply to most , if not all , `` pure '' seyfert 2 s , since we can not determine the nature of their weak uv - excess with the data discussed here . *",
    "a related result is that strong fc sources , those with @xmath84 , are invariably associated with certified starburst / seyfert 2 composites .",
    "we have argued that this is expected , since if scattered light was dominant in such sources then reflected broad lines would render them classified as type 1 seyferts . *",
    "the equivalent widths of emission lines ( h@xmath3 , [ oiii ] , [ oii ] ) , when measured with respect to the fc , are larger in `` pure '' seyfert 2 s than in starburst galaxies .",
    "composites have @xmath105 s intermediate between these two extremes .",
    "this fits with the idea that circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s contribute proportionately more to the fc than to the line flux , since , while the agn - powered line emission is seen directly , only a small fraction of the corresponding non - stellar fc reaches the observer after scattering . * part of the separation in @xmath102 between `` pure '' seyfert 2 s and composites may be due to another contrast effect , in which the high order balmer lines , the main diagnostic of massive stars in the optical , are diluted and eventually filled by nebular emission in strong lined sources , preventing them from being recognized as composites .",
    "* composite systems tend to be less excited in terms of the heii / h@xmath3 and [ oiii]/h@xmath3 ratios .",
    "this indicates that the circum - nuclear starbursts have a direct impact on the emission line properties of seyfert 2 s , with typically @xmath2 of h@xmath3 being powered by ob stars .",
    "* the dual nature of the ionizing source in composites also leaves a kinematical imprint on the emission line profiles , which can be described in terms of a broad component with nlr - like line ratios and a narrower and ( usually ) less excited one .",
    "these components are presumably associated with the gas ionized by the agn and starburst respectively . *",
    "composite galaxies are luminous in the far - ir , with @xmath221 to @xmath222 l@xmath5 and are more luminous than `` pure '' seyfert 2 s and normal galaxies . as a whole , composites are rather similar to merger systems in terms of their far - ir properties . about 50% of the composites , but only 20% of `` pure '' seyfert 2 s are in interacting systems , suggesting that galaxy interactions spur circum - nuclear starbursts . *",
    "composite galaxies have near - uv surface - brightnesses in their central - most few hundred pc that are on - average an order - of - magnitude higher than in normal galaxies of any hubble type .",
    "these high surface brightnesses are similar to those in pure starburst galaxies .",
    "they are also several times higher on - average than in the `` pure '' seyfert 2 s ( whose central surface brightnesses in most cases overlap those of normal early - type galaxies ) . *",
    "these properties were condensed into a set of empirical criteria which separate composite from `` pure '' systems .",
    "most of the diagnostic power resides in the @xmath1   limit .",
    "other properties ( small emission line @xmath105 , low excitation and large @xmath185 ) serve to confirm the @xmath21-based diagnostic of compositeness and to judge border line cases .",
    "we predict that many more starburst / seyfert 2 composites will be uncovered by applying these diagnostics to large samples of near uv spectra . *",
    "the tendency of composites with older starbursts to have smaller h@xmath3 , heii and [ oiii ] emission - line equivalent widths was tentatively interpreted as a sign of the evolution of circum - nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2 s .",
    "circum - nuclear starbursts which are powerful today may fade away and , barring evolution of the active nucleus , appear as `` pure '' seyfert 2 s . by improving the dating techniques and enlarging the databases we hope to trace this evolutionary sequence and thereby put strong constraints on physical scenarios for the starburst - agn connection .",
