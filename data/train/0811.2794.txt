    "lyman alpha ( ly@xmath2 ) galaxies have been studied in detail for nearly a decade now , and we are only just beginning to learn about the properties of individual objects .",
    "most initial narrow - band studies ( e.g. , hu et al . 1998 ; rhoads et al . 2000 ) observed blank fields with two filters : a narrow - band filter ( to capture the ly@xmath2  emission line ) , and a broad - band filter encompassing this narrow - band ( used to measure a narrow - band excess ) .",
    "learning the detailed properties of individual ly@xmath2  galaxies would be difficult with these data",
    ". however , these early studies were able to measure the equivalent widths ( ews ) of their objects , calculated from the ratio of narrow - band flux to broad - band flux ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "some of these initial results were surprising , as in many cases the ly@xmath2  ew distribution was higher than one might have expected from stellar population models , as many objects exhibited rest - frame ly@xmath2  ews over 200   ( e.g. , kudritzki et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) ; dawson et al . ( 2004 ; 2007 ) ; shimasaku et al . ( 2006 ) ; finkelstein et al . ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "a normal stellar population ( defined as having a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , solar metallicity , and a constant star formation rate ) has a maximum ly@xmath2  ew of 260   at 1 myr , falling to a constant value of 95   at 100 myr .",
    "thus , while objects with ews @xmath0 200   are possible with a normal stellar population , they would all have to be extremely young .",
    "looking at a random sample of ly@xmath2  galaxies , it would be extraordinarily rare if they all had ages of only a few myr , thus something is likely happening to skew the ews higher than they should be .",
    "there are many possible reasons why this could be occurring , and the easiest area to examine is the assumption of a normal stellar population . for example , if a stellar population had sub - solar metallicity , it would form stars with hotter stellar photospheres .",
    "these stars would then pour out more ionizing photons , which , after interacting with the local interstellar medium ( ism ) , would in turn create more ly@xmath2  photons .",
    "another possibility exists , whereby if a galaxy had a top - heavy initial mass function , it would create more massive stars than a salpeter imf , again resulting in more ionizing photons , and thus more ly@xmath2  photons .",
    "both of these scenarios are possible in primitive , dust - free galaxies .",
    "strong ly@xmath2  lines also come from the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) components of some galaxies , but previous work has shown that most ly@xmath2  galaxies detected via narrow - band selection are not agn ( malhotra et al .",
    "2003 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "ly@xmath2  photons are resonantly scattered by any neutral hydrogen present , thus in a homogeneous ism , they will have to travel much further to escape the galaxy , dramatically increasing the chance of absorption by dust ( meier & terlevich 1981 ) .",
    "however , if the dust is in an inhomogeneous distribution , it is possible that a galaxy could appear to have a strong ly@xmath2  ew at later ages .    in this scenario",
    ", ly@xmath2  can escape unaffected by dust if it is somehow screened from interacting with the dust grains .",
    "this can happen if the dust resides in cold , neutral clumps embedded in an ionized inter - clump medium .",
    "this scenario was first proposed by neufeld ( 1991 ) and examined in detail more recently by hansen & oh ( 2006 ) . in this ism geometry",
    ", the ly@xmath2  photons get scattered by neutral hydrogen at the surface of these clumps , and thus never see the dust which is embedded deeper inside .",
    "however , the continuum photons suffer no such restriction , so they pass un - obstructed into the interior of the clump , with many continuum photons being absorbed ( extincted ) and scattered ( resulting in reddening of the continuum colour ) .",
    "the ly@xmath2  photons proceed to bounce around from clump to clump , eventually escaping the galaxy .",
    "the net result of this is an increase in the ly@xmath2   continuum flux ratio over that intrinsic to the stellar population .",
    "we would thus detect this galaxy with a higher ew , irrespective of its stellar population characteristics .",
    "we believe that this scenario may be responsible for some of the high - ew objects seen in narrow - band studies , and in our previous work ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2009 ; hereafter f09 ) , we found ten objects out of a sample of 14 laes where this scenario appears to be in effect ( one of which was also studied in finkelstein et al .",
    "two of these objects are evolved galaxies with large ly@xmath2  ews due to this dust enhancement scenario ( the other eight are still young , but have their ly@xmath2  ews enhanced to be larger than their already large value due to dust ) .",
    "the first of these two evolved galaxies was best fit by a 450 myr , 3.8 x 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 stellar population with a rest - frame ew of @xmath5 100  .",
    "this relatively high ew at old age was due to dust , as the best - fit model had 0.3 magnitudes of dust extinction at 1200  , but this dust was in a geometry such that it did not attenuate ly@xmath2  measurably .",
    "this resulted in a @xmath5 35% increase in the ly@xmath2  ew over a similar stellar population with no dust .",
    "the second of these objects had a most likely age ( see f09 for derivation of most likely age ) of 500 myr , a mass of 5 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath4 , and 3.5 mag of dust extinction in a very clumpy geometry , greatly enhancing the ly@xmath2  ew .    while these objects are very interesting , and could go a long way towards explaining the apparent discrepancy in ew distributions , the rest of the objects in the sample had their own surprises .",
    "they were all young and lower - mass , with ages from 3  15 myr , and masses from 1.6 @xmath6 10@xmath8  6.1 @xmath6 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "these ages and masses are indicative of the traditional belief of ly@xmath2  galaxies , where they are very young , and possibly primordial in nature .",
    "however , all of these twelve laes were best fit by stellar populations with considerably non - primordial amounts of dust , with a@xmath9 = 0.5  4.50 , with many galaxies showing indications of a clumpy ism .    by fitting their observations to stellar population synthesis models ,",
    "many other recent studies have derived dust extinction in their ly@xmath2  galaxies as well ( e.g. , chary et al .",
    "2005 ; pirzkal et al . 2007 ; lai et al .",
    "2007 ; pentericci et al . 2008 ) . however , these model parameters can be degenerate , as at rest - frame uv and optical wavelengths the reddening of the continuum colour could be due to both dust _ and _ old stars . while observing these objects in the rest - frame optical with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ helps reduce this degeneracy , data at longer wavelengths could provide much tighter constraints .",
    "when uv and optical photons are absorbed by dust , they are re - emitted in the far - infrared ( fir ) , resulting in a second observed peak in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . observing these galaxies in the sub - millimeter and millimeter ( mm ) regimes would detect this dust emission directly , which could resolve this red - colour degeneracy .",
    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will be a uniquely sensitive tool to detect these high - redshift galaxies if they have dust , given its excellent observing conditions and large baseline .",
    "thus , obtaining alma observations ( even non - detections ) , will provide a much tighter constraint on the amount of dust in these objects than rest - frame uv - optical observations alone .",
    "we use alma as a measure of future observatory capabilities of detecting dust emission from laes .",
    "if we can confirm that many ly@xmath2  galaxies do in fact have dust , then it will help show that they are not the primitive galaxies that they were once thought to be .",
    "on the other hand , if we do not find evidence for dust , it may indicate that a top - heavy imf or population iii stars are responsible for the strong ly@xmath2  ews .",
    "where applicable , we assume benchmark model cosmology , where @xmath10 = 0.3 , @xmath11 = 0.7 and h@xmath12 = 0.7 ( c.f .",

    "2005 ; rhoads et al .",
    "there are 49 lbgs in the catalog , but for objects at redshifts greater than 4.5 , we require j and h band measurements to derive their fir fluxes , thus we were restricted to using only 21 of the 49 lbgs .      while we know that photons absorbed by dust are re - emitted in the far - infrared , the stellar population models used in both f08ab and p07 ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) , while computing fluxes as red as 160 @xmath21 m rest - frame , do not compute dust emission . in order to predict the fir dust emission from the objects in our sample , we exploit a relation between the uv spectral slope ( @xmath22 ; defined as f@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 by calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) and the infrared excess ( defined as the ratio of fir flux to uv flux ) detailed in meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter m97 ) .",
    "this relation is shown in figure 1 of m97 , with the infrared excess increasing exponentially with the spectral slope .",
    "this relation is due to dust reddening of the spectral slope ( @xmath22 becoming less negative ) .",
    "larger quantities of dust will increase the amount of uv extinction , increasing the amount of flux re - emitted in the fir .",

    "we aim to predict fir fluxes independent of stellar population modeling results , with the goal that our method can be applied to objects which only have detections in the optical or nir .    to use the m97 relation , we first require the uv spectral slope for all objects in our sample , which usually requires spectra .",
    "however , in m97 , the authors detail a method of obtaining @xmath22 from the broad - band v and r magnitudes .",

    "table 1 details the relevant parameters for each object in our sample , including the uv spectral slopes calculated with the above method .",
    "once @xmath22 is calculated , we use the relation from m97 to compute the fir flux from the uv flux ( defined in m97 as the flux at 2320  ) .",

    "we used equation 10 from m97 , which details how the fir flux is composed of the flux densities at 60 @xmath21 m and 100 @xmath21 m ( in jy ) : @xmath35    to independently calculate f@xmath36 and f@xmath37 , we require second equation relating these two parameters .",

    "modified blackbody function up to the value of the 60 @xmath21 m flux for each object ( redshifted to the redshift of the object ) , so that we could see how their fluxes behaved at all wavelengths in the range of interest .",
    "we can then compare the flux densities of these objects at any fir wavelength to the sensitivities of sub - mm instruments to see if an object will be detected .",

    "these seven objects , cha-4 , ch8 - 1 , cs2 - 2 , cs2 - 3 , cs2 - 4 and cs2 - 6 , contain dust in a range a@xmath9 = 1.0  4.5 mag .",

    "cha-1 , cha-3 , ch8 - 2 , cs2 - 5 and cs2 - 8 have @xmath22 @xmath34 -2.5 , thus we did not calculate their fir fluxes .",
    "objects cha-2 , cs2 - 1 and cs2 - 7 do have measurable 60 @xmath21 m fluxes ( 0.2  4.7 @xmath21jy ) , but these are likely much too faint to be detectable .",
    "it is of note that cs2 - 4 is only detectable in the 730 @xmath21 m band .",
    "three of the grapes laes which we analyzed appear to be bright enough in the fir to be seen with alma , although only in the 730 @xmath21 m band .",
    "these objects are 5183 , 6139 and 9040 . in pirzkal",
    "( 2007 ) , object 5183 has a maximum dust extinction of a@xmath41 = 0.6 magnitudes ( equivalent to a@xmath9 @xmath5 2.4 ) , and object 6139 is best fit by 0.4 magnitudes of dust extinction .",
    "this is consistent with our results , which imply that the uv light absorbed by this dust is being re - radiated in the fir .",
    "while object 9040 was not best - fit by any dust , the authors do acknowledge that its best - fit model was still a poor fit , although they are confident that it is a lae at its measured redshift .",
    "an important point is that the cdf - s laes have a higher detection fraction than the grapes laes .",
    "this is likely due to differences in the sample selection method .",
    "the cdf - s sample was selected via ground - based narrowband imaging ( with space - based broadband photometry ) .",
    "however , the grapes sample was selected via space - based grism spectroscopy over a much smaller area ( only the hudf vs. the whole cdf - s ) , thus probing much deeper into the faint end of the luminosity function . as the detectability of an object scales not only with its color , but with its continuum brightness as well , fainter objects will be more difficult to detect .",
    "figure 1 also plots the derived fir seds of the sample of 21 lbgs .",
    "dust emission from 11 of the lbgs are detectable at 450 , 610 @xmath21 m and 730 @xmath21 m , with two additional lbgs being detectable at only 730 @xmath21 m . in a rough comparison between lbgs and laes ,",
    "39% of the 23 laes are detectable with alma , compared with 62% for lbgs .",
    "while these numbers may be consistent given the relatively small sample sizes , it could be indicative of a larger difference between the types of objects .",
    "traditionally , lbgs are thought to harbor more evolved and more massive stellar populations than those in laes .",
    "however , from this result , we now see that lbgs may also have a higher dust content than laes .",
    "this is confirmed by the average @xmath22 of the two samples , which indicates that lbgs have a redder uv slope with @xmath42 = -1.62 , compared with @xmath43 = -2.03 .",

    "( 2007 ) , who found that lbgs were dustier than laes .",
    "this is interesting , given that in f09 we found that our sample of laes had much higher dust extinction rates than we would have thought .",
    "thus , while laes appear to have some amount of processed ism , the ism of lbgs appears to be much more enriched , resulting in higher dust emission in the fir .      we have chosen a value of f@xmath37/f@xmath36 = 3.64 from bendo et al .",

    "larger values of f@xmath37/f@xmath36 imply a cooler ism ( thus a cooler dust temperature ) , while smaller values imply a warm ism , more consistent with compact star formation ( dale et al .",
    "dale et al . ( 2001 ) and dale and helou ( 2002 ) compute model fir seds assuming a large range in fir color , from 0.8 @xmath34 f@xmath37/f@xmath36 @xmath34 3.3 . since laes are expected to be undergoing significant bouts of star formation , and they are quite compact ( e.g. , pirzkal et al . 2007 ) , it is interesting to see how our derived fir seds would change if we assume a warmer value of f@xmath37/f@xmath36 .",
    "the observations presented in dale & helou ( 2002 ) show that the number of objects drops off considerably below f@xmath37/f@xmath36 = 1 , so we assumed f@xmath37 = f@xmath36 , and redid our calculations . figure 2 shows these results for cs2 - 2 , which was one of the fainter laes detected in all alma bands .",
    "since warmer fir seds will result in fainter fluxes in the alma observable range , this plot can give us an idea of the limits on our predicted fluxes .",
    "we find that although the shape of the sed has changed as expected , this particular object would still be detected .",

    "all filled circles lie above the alma 4 hour sensitivity contour ( black line ) showing that figures 1 and 3 & 4 are mutually consistent , although the three detectable hudf laes do lie less than 1@xmath44 above the alma 4 hour sensitivity contour . using these figures",
    ", one could then take the colour , magnitude and rough redshift of any object , and determine if the dust emission could be detected by seeing if the points lie above the alma sensitivity contour .",
    "figures 3 & 4 allow us to examine the robustness of our results , as we have visualized the 1@xmath44 errors on our objects fluxes .",
    "we can thus see how close our objects are to the alma sensitivity limit as a function of their photometric errors .",
    "while 39% of the laes will have their dust emission detectable , only 17% ( 4/23 ) of them lie more than 1@xmath44 from the alma sensitivity contour .",

    "they find that galaxies with derived ages @xmath34 100 myr exhibit a smaller fir excess than that predicted by the m97 relation , indicating that these young galaxies have redder uv colors for a given amount of dust extinction that older galaxies .",
    "this is of concern as most of our laes have very young derived stellar population ages . in addition ,",
    "baker et al . ( 2006 ) find that the m97 relation also over - predicts the fir flux for the gravitationally lensed lbg cb58 . however , there are differences between these objects and laes , as they are at a lower redshift , and they are continuum selected .",
    "we thus can not know if the same age dependence will apply to laes until we obtain a statistical sample of rest - frame fir detections of laes .",
    "in addition , the reddy et al .",
    "figure which illustrates the age discrepancy does not have error estimates on their young object points , thus it is hard to discern how significant this effect is .",
    "baker et al .",
    "do show error bars , and these errors imply that their observations are only off the m97 relation by @xmath5 1 @xmath44 .    if young objects do have systematically lower f@xmath31/f@xmath32 ratios , it would be worrying , as it could imply that we are over - predicting the fir fluxes of our laes by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "it is thus prudent to apply our results to any relevant observations to see if our fir flux predictions are accurate .",
    "although very few galaxies with ly@xmath2  emission have been detected in their rest - frame fir , capak et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have recently published a study of a spectroscopically confirmed millimeter starburst galaxy , which does exhibit ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "they publish the observed sed of this galaxy from x - rays to radio wavelengths . using the published optical magnitudes , we can compute @xmath22 , and predict the fir flux . doing this , we calculate a predicted 554 ( rest 100 ) @xmath21 m flux of 2637@xmath48 @xmath21jy . however , the closest point in the observed sed is at 1.1 mm , at 4800 @xmath1 1500 @xmath21jy .",
    "the flux of our derived sed at 1.1 mm is 2054@xmath49 @xmath21jy , thus they are consistent within 1 @xmath44 .",
    "these observations give evidence that our predictions do match observations .",
    "we show the sed from capak et al . along with our predictions for this object in figure 5 .",
    "additionally , we also show the v , i , z and 3.6 @xmath21 m fluxes for ch8 - 1 , which was one of our redder laes .",
    "these points have been scaled to match the i flux of the capak et al .",
    "we can see that the i - z color is somewhat redder than the capak et al .",
    "object ( 0.3 versus 0.15 ) , which indicates that ch8 - 1 is dustier , explaining its higher expected fir flux .",
    "however , as it is intrinsically fainter ( the scaling factor was @xmath5 17 ) , it would be much harder to detect with current instrumentation .    although we have assumed a reasonable sed shape , it is possible that the fir sed could be much different .",
    "houck et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discuss the low metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxy sbs 0335 - 052 , which has a fir spectrum much different than typical starburst galaxies , peaking at @xmath5 28 @xmath21 m , indicating much warmer dust , possibly due to the lower metallicity .",
    "high - redshift laes may be expected to have a very low metallicity , thus it is worth mentioning that if any of our objects had this type of sed , we could be vastly overestimating their fir flux .",
    "we have thus investigated the dependence of our results on these derived fir fluxes . to do this",
    ", we reduced our fir flux to be 50% of its derived value , and computed the alma detection fraction of both types of objects .",
    "we calculated a detection fraction of 26% for laes and 62% for lbgs ( 57% and 76% for laes and lbgs respectively within 1@xmath44 of the alma contour ) .",
    "thus , while we believe that the m97 relation is applicable to our objects , we find that our conclusions are robust to a factor of two variation in the fir flux .",
    "directly observing dust emission from ly@xmath2  galaxies will provide undeniable proof that these earliest of galaxies have undergone some enrichment of their ism . while these observations are currently difficult , we have been able to predict whether a sample of 23 laes would be detected with a future sub - mm observatory such as alma based on their optical and nir fluxes . exploiting a relation from meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which relates the far - infrared excess to the uv continuum slope , we have derived the fir fluxes from these laes , which will be primarily due to dust emission . by comparing these fluxes to the sensitivity of alma at 450 , 610 and 730 @xmath21 m ,",
    "we have determined that 39% ( 9/23 ) of our sample of laes should be detectable based on their dust emission .",
    "we perform the same analysis on a sample of 21 lyman break galaxies , finding that 62% ( 13/21 ) of the lbgs are detectable with alma , @xmath5 60% higher than the detection fraction of laes .",
    "this may be a function of our small sample size , or it may be the result of a true dichotomy in the dust contents of laes and lbgs , providing further proof that lbgs are a more evolved class of high - z galaxy . in order to generalize our results , we computed the fir fluxes for a wide range of continuum magnitudes and colours , comparing these fluxes to the alma 4 hour sensitivity limit .",
    "thus , knowing the continuum magnitude and colour of any object , one can then predict whether its dust emission will be detectable .",
    "while stellar population modeling gives some insight on the amount of dust in high - redshift galaxies , future sub - mm instruments will allow us to directly observe the dust emission from these objects , providing a more complete census of dust . from our analysis of laes and lbgs in the hudf",
    ", we calculate a number density of alma detectable laes and lbgs of 0.26 arcmin@xmath50 , and 1.13 arcmin@xmath50 respectively .",
    "thus , even in a small survey area , one could expect to detect a number of high - redshift objects with alma in a reasonable amount of time . in our previous analysis of laes ,",
    "the addition of the clumpiness parameter allows strong ly@xmath2  flux to an arbitrarily old and dusty galaxy , thus these alma observations will help to constrain the amount of dust , and thus the level of clumpiness .",
    "these results will have considerable impact on several areas of galaxy evolution , specifically on the star formation rate ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 ) , which , being derived from uv observations , is critically dependent on accurate measurements of the dust content . combining alma with uv observations",
    ", we will have a complete map of star formation in high - redshift galaxies ( i.e. gao 2008 ) .",
    "studying the sub - millimeter emission of these objects will also allow calculation of the total dust mass , which is something one can not calculate from uv - optical data alone .",
    "along with learning about the total amount of dust in these objects , alma will give us the opportunity to investigate the distribution of dust due to its excellent resolution . at 730 ghz",
    ", alma can achieve resolutions down to 001 pix@xmath17 . combining alma observations with high resolution _",
    "hst _ data will allow us to investigate dust on local scales at high - redshift for the first time .",
    "strong sub - millimeter detections combined with strong ly@xmath2  emission could indicate that dust enhancement of the ly@xmath2  ew is widespread .",
