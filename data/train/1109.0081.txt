    "black - hole - binary mergers are both key sources of gravitational waves @xcite and two - body systems in general relativity of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "it is common to describe the dynamics and the waveform of a quasicircular black - hole binary as passing through three different stages : inspiral , merger , and ringdown ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for comparable - mass black holes ,",
    "the three stages correspond to the times one can use different approximation schemes . during the first stage , inspiral , the two black holes can be modeled by the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation as two point particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review of pn theory ) .",
    "as the speeds of the two holes increase while their separation shrinks , the pn expansion becomes less accurate ( particularly as the two objects begin to merge to form a single body ) . in this stage , merger , gravity becomes strongly nonlinear ( and therefore less accessible to approximation techniques ) .",
    "after the merger , there is the ringdown , during which the spacetime closely resembles a stationary black hole with small perturbations [ and one can treat the problem using black - hole perturbation ( bhp ) theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review of bhp theory ) ] .    because the merger phase of comparable - mass black holes has been so challenging to understand analytically , there have been many attempts to study it with a variety of analytical tools .",
    "one approach has been to develop pn and bhp theories to high orders in the different approximations . since neither approximation can yet describe the complete merger of black - hole binaries , several groups worked on developing methods that aim to get the most out of a given approximation technique .",
    "the close - limit approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite for early work and @xcite for more recent work ) and the lazarus project ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) both try to push the validity of bhp to early times ; the effective - one - body ( eob ) approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the formative work , and @xcite for further developments that allow the method to replicate numerical - relativity waveforms ) aims to extend the validity of the pn approximation to later times .",
    "there also have been several methods that do not easily fit into the characterization of extensions of pn or bhp theories .",
    "for example , the `` particle - membrane '' approach of anninos et al.@xcite computes the waveform from head - on collisions by extrapolating results from the point - particle limit to the comparable - mass case ( and taking into account changes to the horizons computed within the membrane paradigm @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , white - hole fission was used in approximate models of black - hole mergers @xcite , and quite recently , jaramillo and collaborators @xcite used robinson - trautman spacetimes as an approximate analytical model of binary mergers ( as part of a larger project correlating geometrical quantities on black - hole horizons with similar quantities at future null infinity ) .",
    "analytical approximations are not limited to comparable - mass black - hole binaries , and recently there has been a large body of work on developing techniques to study intermediate- and extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( imris and emris , respectively ) .",
    "most of these methods aim to produce gravitational waves in ways that are less computationally expensive than computing the exact numerical solution or computing the leading - order gravitational self - force are ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review of the self - force ) .",
    "the majority of the approaches rely heavily on bhp techniques combined with some prescription for taking radiative effects into account , though not all approximate methods fall into this classification ( barack and cutler @xcite , for example , model emris by instantaneously newtonian orbits whose orbital parameters vary slowly over the orbital time scale because of higher - order pn effects ) .",
    "a well - known example is that of hughes @xcite , glampedakis @xcite , drasco @xcite , sundararajan @xcite and their collaborators whose semi - analytical approaches are often called teukolsky - based models .",
    "these methods describe the small black hole as moving along a sequence of geodesics whose energy , angular momentum , and carter constant change from the influence of emitted gravitational waves .",
    "they usually involve some additional prescription to treat the transition from the inspiral to the plunge , when the motion is no longer adiabatic .",
    "the eob formalism in the emri limit , however , does not require an assumption of adiabatic motion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by choosing the dynamics of the emri to follow the eob hamiltonian and a resummed multipolar pn radiation - reaction force @xcite",
    ", these authors can calculate an approximate waveform without any assumption on relative time scales of orbital and radiative effects .",
    "one can also make an adiabatic approximation with eob methods , as yunes et al .",
    "@xcite recently did in their calibration of the eob method to a set of teukolsky - based waveforms .",
    "lousto and collaborators @xcite took a different approach to the emri problem in their recent work .",
    "they used trajectories from numerical - relativity simulations of imris as a way to calibrate pn expressions for the motion of the small black hole .",
    "they then performed approximate calculations of the gravitational waves using the pn trajectories in a black - hole perturbation calculation , and found good agreement with their numerical results .    in a previous article @xcite",
    "( hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we showed that for head - on collisions , one can match pn and bhp theories on a timelike world tube that passes through the centers of the pn theory s point particles .",
    "the positions of the points particles as a function of time ( and , consequently , the world tube ) were chosen before evolving the waveform . moreover ,",
    "they were selected in such a way that both pn and bhp theories were sufficiently accurate descriptions of the spacetime on the world tube or the errors in the theories did not enter into the waveform .",
    "( a plunging geodesic in the schwarzschild spacetime worked in paper i. ) this allowed us compute a complete waveform for all three phases of black - hole - binary coalescence and gave us a way to interpret the different portions of the waveform .",
    "moreover , when we compared the waveform from the hybrid method with that of a full numerical simulation of plunging equal - mass black holes with transverse , antialigned spins , we found very good agreement between the two .",
    "there is no reason , _ a priori _ , why the same procedure of paper i ( namely , specifying the position of the point particles as a function of time and matching the metrics on a surface passing through their positions ) should not work for inspiralling black holes as well .",
    "the principal difficulty arises from trying to find a way of specifying the positions of the particles for inspiralling black holes ( and thus a location at which to match the pn and bhp metrics ) that does not introduce errors into any of the three stages of the inspiral , merger , or ringdown portions of the waveform .",
    "the most important development that we introduce in this paper , therefore , is a way of achieving this goal by including a radiation - reaction force into the formalism . in the hybrid method , we compute a radiation - reaction force by using the outgoing waves in the exterior bhp spacetime to modify the pn dynamics in the interior through a radiation - reaction potential @xcite .",
    "we show , in this formalism , that introducing a radiation - reaction potential is equivalent to solving a self - consistent set of coupled equations that describe the evolution of the point particles reduced - mass motion and the outgoing gravitational radiation , where the particles generate the metric perturbations of the gravitational waves and the waves carry away energy and angular momentum from the particles ( thereby changing their motion ) .",
    "our principal goal in the paper is to explore this coupled set of evolution equations and show , numerically , that it gives rise to convergent and reasonable results .",
    "we will use these results to make a refinement of our interpretation of the waveform from paper i , and we will also compare the waveform generated by the hybrid method to that from a numerical - relativity simulation of an equal - mass , nonspinning inspiral of black holes .",
    "the two waveforms agree well during the inspiral phase , but less well during merger and ringdown .",
    "the discrepancy at late times is well understood : we continue to model the final black hole produced from the merger as nonspinning , although , in fact , numerical simulations have shown the final hole to be spinning relatively rapidly ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . adapting the hybrid approach to treat",
    "the final black hole as rotating is beyond the scope of this work , but is something that we will investigate in the future .    as an application of the hybrid method for inspirals",
    ", we explore the large kicks produced from black - hole binaries with antialigned spins in the orbital plane ( the superkick configuration @xcite ) . as noted by schnittman et al .",
    "@xcite and emphasized to us by thorne @xcite , the spins must precess at the orbital frequency during the final stage of the merger . while brgmann et al .",
    "@xcite were able to replicate this effect using a combination of pn and numerical - relativity results , we will need to take a different approach , by using geodetic precession in the exterior schwarzschild bhp spacetime , to have the spins lock to the orbital motion at the merger .",
    "when we include the geodetic effect , we are able to recover the correct qualitative profile of the kick , although the magnitude does not match precisely .",

    "we assumed that this tube would be spherically symmetric , and we found its radius by first assuming the reduced - mass motion of the system followed a radial geodesic of a plunging test mass in the background schwarzschild spacetime and then setting the radius of the world tube to be half this distance at each time .",

    "in this paper , while much of the procedure we use for matching the metrics is identical to that set forth above , there are several important differences that we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : radrxn ]",
    ". the most important difference between the first paper and the current one arises in how we find the trajectory of the system s reduced mass ( and then the timelike tube on which we match the metrics ) . before , we chose a region , prior to evolving the regge - wheeler and zerilli equations , that would not introduce spurious effects into the results ; here we determine the position of timelike world tube through evolving the position of the reduced mass of the binary subject to a radiation - reaction force .",
    "we will discuss the details of this procedure in the next section .",
    "in this section , we introduce a radiation - reaction potential into the hybrid method , and we show that it leads to a set of evolution equations that simultaneously evolve both the outgoing radiation and dynamics of the reduced mass of the system .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to produce a full inspiral - merger - ringdown waveform .",
    "we first qualitatively discuss how our method works and how it compares to other analytical methods .",
    "we then discuss the hybrid method in further detail , and we close this section by showing , analytically , that the procedure recovers the correct burke - thorne radiation - reaction potential @xcite in the weak - field limit .      ) , and thereby tie the motion of the matching region through the black - hole effective potential to portions of the waveform .",
    "this gives an interpretation of inspiral , merger , and ringdown phases in terms of the direct and scattered parts of the waves .",
    "further discussion of this figure is given in the text of sec.[sec : radrxn ] . ]",
    "it is easiest to discuss our method with the aid of the spacetime diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "we describe the region within the solid black timelike curve with the near - zone pn metric , and outside this curve , we use a perturbed schwarzschild region .",
    "the black line , which passes through the pn point particles , is where we match the two metrics .",
    "we suppress both angular coordinates , so that each point on the curve represents the matching shell that we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] .",
    "the shaded region represents the black - hole potential ; the yellow ( light gray ) shade depicts the strong - field portion of the black - hole potential ( the strong - field near zone ) and the green ( gray ) shade shows the region where centrifugal potential is significant ( the weak - field near zone ) .",
    "there is a wave zone near the horizon ( large @xmath50 ) , and , consequently , the region where there is a large black - hole potential is confined to a small space in this diagram .    to have fig .",
    "[ diagram ] be an effective description of the spacetime of a black - hole binary , both pn and bhp theories both must be sufficiently accurate at the pn point particles ( the black line where we match the metrics ) , or the pn approximation could break down if the point particles are well - hidden within the black - hole effective potential . for the errors to stay within the potential , the particles must rapidly fall to the horizon ; thus one can see in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] that the black curve approaches an ingoing null ray asymptotically .",
    "( recall that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the light - cone coordinates of the bhp spacetime . ) following this trajectory , the perturbations induced by the pn spacetime will become strongly redshifted , and they will not escape the black - hole potential ( as price had found in his description of stellar collapse @xcite ) , because the potential reflects low frequency perturbations .    as in paper i , we will again be able to interpret different portions of the waveform by connecting a region of the waveform with the position of the pn binary s point particles in the near zone ( via constant values of the light - cone coordinate , @xmath50 ) . in the figure these are the thick red ( gray )",
    "dashed lines of constant @xmath50 .",
    "the inspiral part of the waveform , which propagates directly along the light cone , comes from the part of the trajectory within the weak - field near zone .",
    "once the trajectory reaches within the strong - field near zone , the waves scatter off of the potential and propagate within the light cone ( often referred to as the pn tail part of the wave ) in addition to propagating out directly .",
    "we view this mixed wave as characteristic of the merger phase .",
    "finally , as the trajectory falls within the effective potential , for a schwarzschild black hole the direct part vanishes and only the scattered waves emerge ; this part is the quasinormal ringing of the final black hole and should be associated with the ringdown phase .",
    "we distinguish between schwarzschild and kerr black holes for the ringdown phase , because mino and brink @xcite and , subsequently , zimmerman and chen @xcite found that for kerr black holes , frame dragging generates a part of the waveform at the horizon frequency ( that decays at a rate proportional to the horizon s surface gravity ) .",
    "this piece of the waveform looks like a source , and , thus , only when the final black hole is not spinning do we consider the spacetime to appear to be source free . for this reason ( and since the matching surface asymptotes to a line of constant @xmath51 ) , we call the values of @xmath51 greater than this limiting value the homogeneous region , and the values of @xmath51 less than this the source region .    an important development in this paper",
    "is that we no longer prescribe the evolution of the reduced mass of the system ( and thereby a matching region ) before evolving the regge - wheeler or zerilli equations ; rather , we specify a set of evolution equations for the conservative dynamics of the binary , and let the outgoing waves provide back reaction onto the dynamics .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a self - consistent system of equations including radiation reaction .",
    "more concretely , we continue to match the pn and perturbed schwarzschild metrics at the centers of the pn theory s point particles .",
    "moreover , we will again let the reduced - mass motion of the binary system follow that of a point particle in a schwarzschild background ; in this paper , however , we will use the fact that there are no ingoing waves to specify a radiation - reaction potential that acts as a dissipative force on the hamiltonian dynamics of the reduced mass .",
    "this follows the spirit of the burke - thorne radiation - reaction potential , but the radiation propagates within a bhp spacetime , and , therefore , also takes the effects of the background curvature into account .",
    "furthermore , adding a radiation - reaction force to the hybrid method leads to a set of equations that simultaneously evolve the zerilli equation ( the waveform ) and the reduced - mass motion of the binary . in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] we represent schematically how this occurs .",
    "we start at a given @xmath51 [ a dark blue ( dark gray ) dashed line given in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ] and assume that there is a no - ingoing - wave boundary condition along the line @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , we suppose that we have determined the black - hole - perturbation functions for all smaller values of @xmath51 , up to the timelike matching surface . by evolving the zerilli equation , eq .",
    "( [ wave_eq ] ) , one can find the zerilli function at @xmath53 up to the time @xmath54 [ within the dark blue ( dark gray ) shaded region ] .",
    "the no - ingoing - wave condition combined with the boundary condition on the matching surface , however , fixes how the zerilli function will evolve to larger values of @xmath50 .",
    "when solved simultaneously with the hamiltonian dynamics describing the binary s motion , this lets one find the position of the reduced mass of the binary at @xmath53 , denoted by @xmath55 in the figure , and the new value of the zerilli function there .",
    "one can evolve the system for all @xmath51 in such a manner .    including a radiation - reaction force does not greatly change the hybrid method as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] .",
    "the matching procedure works the same ; one modification that comes about is that we must include both the newtonian potential and the radiation - reaction potential in the pn metric ( and , therefore , gain an additional term in the zerilli function ) .",
    "the evolution system is now quite different , because it is a coupled system of hamiltonian ordinary differential equations and a one - dimensional partial differential equation .",
    "we will discuss the system of evolution equations in greater detail after we compare our method with other analytical methods in the next subsection .      in this section",
    ", we will compare the similarities and differences between the hybrid method described above and the most closely related methods mentioned in the introduction : the close - limit approximation , the lazarus program , the comparable - mass eob methods , the teukolsky - based approach , the eob description of emris , and the imri calculation calibrated to numerical - relativity data .",
    "the comparison between the hybrid method and the other methods will be descriptive , but we will compare the waveform from the hybrid method with a numerical - relativity waveform in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ]    to compare with the lazarus project or the close - limit approximation , we again refer to fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , where we show two spacelike hypersurfaces ( the horizontal dashed lines labeled by @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . in the close - limit and lazarus methods ,",
    "initial data is posed on these surfaces at a time near the merger of the black holes . while these approaches have been successful , posing initial data at late times",
    "makes it more difficult to smoothly connect the initial inspiral of the binary to the merger and ringdown later .",
    "moreover , because the initial data extends inside the black - hole potential , if it contains high - frequency perturbations , these could escape the potential barrier and enter into the waveform .",
    "the hybrid approach escapes this problem by setting boundary data on a timelike world tube rather than on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "this also lets the method connect the inspiral , merger , and ringdown portions of the dynamics and waveform more directly .",
    "the eob approach , for comparable - mass ratio binaries , only describes times prior to the merger ( the hypersurfaces @xmath56 and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) . to create a full inspiral - merger - ringdown waveform ,",
    "the eob method must fit a sequence of quasinormal modes to the end of the insprial - plunge waveform .",
    "this procedure makes a very accurate waveform , but it makes connecting the behavior of the spacetime before and after the merger more difficult .",
    "the hybrid method , with its interior pn region that falls toward the horizon at late times , allows one to make a more clear connection between the dynamics of the spacetime during inspiral and merger to that during ringdown . in its current implementation , however , it does not produce a waveform nearly as accurate as that of the eob .",
    "although the hybrid method is designed for describing comparable - mass black - hole binaries , it shares a few similarities and has several significant differences from various approximate techniques that model emris .",
    "it is possible to draw a few general comparisons between the hybrid method and the procedures for studying emris , before moving to more specific comparisons .",
    "while the hybrid method evolves perturbations on a black - hole background ( as most emri methods do ) , emri methods assume a source term as the generator of the perturbations in the background .",
    "the hybrid approach , however , does not have a source term ; rather , the perturbations of the background come from boundary data that correspond to the multipolar structure of a comparable - mass pn binary . because the hybrid approach is a boundary - value problem , the details of the implementation will be different from those methods that use a point mass as a source term .    moving to specific emri models ,",
    "we first compare the hybrid approach with the teukolsky - based methods of sundararajan and collaborators @xcite ( for example ) .",
    "the hybrid approach is similar to that of @xcite , in that both use time domain codes and are capable of producing smooth inspiral - merger - ringdown waveforms .",
    "an important difference is that the hybrid method calculates the waveform simultaneously with the evolution of the matching region , whereas the emri method of sundararajan computes the trajectory before the evolution ( using an adiabatic frequency - domain code during insprial , and a prescription for the plunge and merger ) and then finds the waveform from this trajectory .",
    "moreover , we compute the radiation - reaction force in the hybrid method by matching the near - zone pn solution to an outgoing solution in the exterior bhp spacetime , whereas the teukolsky - based methods include radiative effects by evolving the orbital parameters of geodesics from averaged fluxes at infinity .    the eob model of yunes et al .",
    "@xcite , is a calibration of the eob method to teukolsky - based waveforms for emris ; it , therefore , shares the same similarities and differences as the eob and the teukolsky - based methods discussed above .",
    "han and cao @xcite develop an eob model that uses the a teukolsky - based energy flux ( in the frequency domain ) to treat radiative effects . in comparing with the hybrid model , therefore",
    ", it also falls somewhere between an eob model and a teukolsky - based method .",
    "the recent eob work of bernuzzi and collaborators @xcite shares more similarity with the hybrid method , because they evolve the regge - wheeler - zerilli equations in the time domain .",
    "the most notable specific difference ( as opposed to the general differences between the hybrid - method and all analytical approaches to emris noted above ) is in the radiation - reaction force .",
    "the eob model uses a high - pn - order , resummed energy flux , whereas ( as also noted above ) the hybrid method determines radiative effects from directly matching a near - zone pn solution to an outgoing bhp solution .",
    "we conclude this section by comparing the hybrid method with the recent analytical work of lousto et al .",
    "they take two approaches to calculating waveforms for imris perturbatively . in their initial work",
    ", they transform the trajectory of the small black hole from their numerical - relativity simulations into the schwarzschild gauge , and they compute the waveform using this numerical trajectory in a bhp calculation . to be able to study a wider range of mass ratios , they use pn expressions for the change in frequency and the radial trajectory , but use the numerical - relativity values of the frequency to calibrate the pn functions .",
    "the hybrid method differs from this , because it calculates the matching region simultaneously with the waveform , and it does not use numerical - relativity data to calibrate results . consequently , the hybrid method does not agree as well with exact results as well as the other methods discussed here , but it does present a distinct way of calculating the approximate spacetime and gravitational waveform .      in this section , we will discuss the details of radiation reaction in the hybrid method",
    ". the end result will be the set of evolution equations described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : full1 ] )  ( [ eq : full2 ] ) , and the majority of this section will be devoted to deriving this system of equations .",

    "( [ eqn : pnmetric ] ) of sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] , though without the gravitomagnetic terms . here",
    ", however , we write the newtonian potential ( expanded to quadrupole order ) as @xmath59 the first term is the monopole piece ( @xmath17 is the total mass of the binary ) and the first term in the sum is the quadrupole part ( and @xmath60 are the quadrupole moments of the binary ) .",
    "these two terms above are identical to those of paper i , but the second term in the sum ( the polynomial in @xmath26 with coefficients @xmath61 ) is different .",
    "one can include the terms proportional to @xmath61 , because like the newtonian potential , they are solutions to poisson s equation .",
    "these terms diverge at infinity ( which restricts their use to the near zone ) , but they can not be determined from the near - zone dynamics alone , however .",
    "burke showed @xcite , using the technique of matched asymptotic expansions , that the terms with coefficients @xmath61 could represent the reaction of the binary in the near - zone to radiation losses to infinity .",
    "the portion of the potential due to the moments @xmath61 , therefore , is called the burke - thorne radiation - reaction potential .    in the hybrid method , we will find a similar quantity in the interior pn spacetime by matching the pn near - zone solution to a solution in the schwarzschild exterior with no ingoing waves .",

    "in the next section , we will put forward an equation of spin precession based on geodetic precession in the external schwarzschild spacetime , which will have the desired spin - precession behavior .    before turning to the next section",
    ", we address the question of why pn spin precession worked so successfully for brgmann et al .",
    "their initial data begins in a gauge that is identical to the 2pn admtt gauge , and they assume that it continues to stay in that gauge throughout their evolution . as a result , they use the puncture trajectories as the positions of the black holes , and the 2pn admtt gauge expressions to relate the momenta of the black holes to their velocities .",
    "although the pn equations of spin precession are written in harmonic gauge , they use the puncture results to calculate these expressions .",
    "this is reasonable , because the harmonic and admtt gauge positions do not differ much until separations of roughly @xmath215 .",
    "their puncture separations do reach small values of @xmath216 prior to merger , and they continue to use the harmonic - gauge spin - precession formula in this regime ( even as the pn approximation starts becoming less accurate ) .",
    "this works remarkably well , nevertheless , and , as one can see from eq.([eq : spin_prec_simp ] ) , when @xmath217 , the spins will precess at the orbital frequency .",
    "thus , the work of brgmann et al .  helps to confirm that the locking of the orbital and spin - precession frequencies is important in the superkick merger , but to replicate this effect in the hybrid method will require a different approach , described below .",
    "our approach to spin precession relies on geodetic precession in the schwarzschild spacetime , which we review below .",
    "the problem of geodetic precession of a spin on a circular orbit in the schwarzschild spacetime is well understood ; its derivation appears in the introductory text by hartle @xcite , for example .",
    "we will reproduce some of the important elements of the derivation here , using our notation , however .",

    "nevertheless , the hybrid method does produce a waveform that is quite similar to that of numerical relativity .",
    "we also studied spinning black holes , particularly the superkick configuration ( antialigned spins in the orbital plane ) .",
    "we discussed a method to incorporate spin precession , based on the geodetic precession of a spinning point particle in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this caused the spins to lock to the orbital motion during the merger and ringdown , which , in turn , helped to replicate the pattern of the momentum flux and the sinusoidal dependence of the merged black hole s kick velocity seen in numerical simulations .",
    "again , because the amplitude of the emitted gravitational waves does not match that of numerical - relativity simulations , the magnitude of the kick does not completely agree .",
    "nevertheless , because the approximate method was able to capture the pattern of the momentum flux , it gives credence to the idea the locking of the spin - precession frequency to the orbital frequency contributes to large black - hole kicks .",
    "it would be of interest to extend this approach to see if it can recover the results of numerical relativity more precisely . to do this",
    "would involve a two - pronged approach : on the one hand , we would need to include higher pn terms in the metric in the interior while using a more accurate hamiltonian to describe the conservative dynamics of the binary ( such as the eob hamiltonian ) ; on the other hand , we would need to evolve the perturbations in a kerr background",
    ". it would be simpler to choose the kerr background to have the spin of the final , merged black hole , but one could also envision evolving perturbations in an adiabatically changing kerr - like background with a slowly varying mass and angular momentum parameter that change in response to the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "it would be of interest to see if such an approach leads to an estimate of the spin of the final black hole similar to that proposed by buonanno , kidder , and lehner @xcite .",
    "incorporating the pn corrections and a new hamiltonian would be the most straightforward improvement , while those involving the kerr background are technically more challenging , and computationally more expensive .",
