    "rather than being an anomalous side - effect in one or two cuprate systems , broken - symmetry states are now thought to be widespread in strongly correlated electron systems and other complex materials .",
    "extensive study of the manganites  @xcite , cuprates  @xcite , iron pnictides  @xcite , and a variety of other systems has made it increasingly evident that local and global symmetry - breaking in the charge , orbital , lattice , and spin degrees of freedom are associated with the appearance of emergent phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance and high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) , but the exact relationship is not understood .",
    "historically , the study of such broken - symmetry states has been very challenging .",
    "taking the cuprates as an example , eight years elapsed from the initial discovery of superconductivity to the first observation of symmetry - broken charge order ( stripes ) in one system  @xcite , another seven years passed before hints were found in others  @xcite , and only within the last three years has charge order begun to emerge as a possibly ubiquitous feature of the cuprates  @xcite .",
    "several possibilities arise when considering the symmetries that can be broken by these states .",
    "most charge / spin - density - waves ( c / sdws ) break the translational symmetry of the lattice , folding the brillouin zone and resulting in superlattice diffraction peaks . on the other hand , orbital ordering , where charge transfers between orbitals centered at the same site , can break the metric rotational symmetry without lowering the translational symmetry .",
    "examples are charge - nematic  @xcite and loop - current  @xcite orders in the doped cuprates . in this context",
    ", nematic order is defined as one that breaks the rotational point group symmetry while preserving the lattice translational symmetry .",
    "the fact that nematic symmetry - broken states have recently been discovered experimentally in both the cuprate  @xcite and iron - based  @xcite superconductors raises the importance and relevance of this observation to htsc .",
    "it is therefore critically important to understand the role and ubiquity of symmetry breaking , including intra - unit - cell nematicity , to the superconducting phenomenon .",
    "standard theoretical treatments of htsc , such as the effective single - band @xmath1 model , have typically ignored the possibility of intra - unit - cell orders  @xcite . when multiple atoms per unit cell are explicitly included in the theory ,",
    "qualitatively different ground - state solutions may be found  @xcite , underscoring the subtlety and importance of accounting correctly for this phenomenon .",
    "hence , finding related but distinct systems that exhibit this phenomenon is expected to shed new light on this critical question .",
    "very recently , superconductivity was discovered  @xcite in titanium - oxypnictide compounds such as @xmath2ti@xmath3o ( @xmath4na@xmath5 , ba , ( srf)@xmath5 , ( smo)@xmath5 ; @xmath6as , sb , bi ) , which are close structural and chemical cousins to the cuprates and iron - pnictides  @xcite . in particular , in isovalent bati@xmath5(sb@xmath7bi@xmath8)@xmath5o and aliovalent ba@xmath7na@xmath8ti@xmath5sb@xmath5o ,  @xcite muon spin rotation and heat capacity measurements point to fully - gapped @xmath9-wave superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a number of compounds in this family also show strong anomalies in resistivity and/or magnetic susceptibility that are thought to be signatures of symmetry - breaking charge- or spin - ordered ground states  @xcite , suggesting that these materials are excellent candidates for studying the interplay between broken - symmetry states and superconductivity . in light of these strong transport anomalies ,",
    "it is then quite surprising that subsequent experiments have failed to uncover any direct evidence for a conventional spin- or charge - density wave ground state  @xcite , leaving open the question of whether these materials do possess symmetry - broken ground states .",
    "here we show that superconducting , and its non - superconducting parent compound , do indeed undergo a tetragonal - orthorhombic phase transition , corresponding to a @xmath10 symmetry lowering , that occurs at the temperature of the transport anomaly . on the other hand",
    ", high - sensitivity electron diffraction measurements failed to detect any superlattice peaks in the bulk at low temperature , indicating that this transition does not break translational symmetry .",
    "the low - temperature phase therefore constitutes a nematic state . in light of the pronounced upturn in resistivity accompanying this nematic transition , together with the absence of any ordered sdw  @xcite , we attribute the nematicity to an intra - unit - cell charge order with @xmath0-wave symmetry by charge transfer between neighboring ti sites  similar to that between neighboring oxygen sites in cuprate superconductors  and find that it naturally explains the temperature dependence of the lattice constants .",
    "these results establish this family of materials as another playground for studying symmetry - breaking electronic phases and their relationship to superconductivity .",

    "[ fig : planes ] , the square net is shown by solid lines along the nearest neighbor bonds , with dashed lines showing the net joining second neighbor ions .",
    "this second - nearest - neighbor square net connects oxygen ions in the cuprates , but metal ions in the titanate compounds and also in the iron - based superconductors [ fig .",
    "[ fig : planes](c ) ] . thus , in terms of chemistry and structure , the titanate compounds bridge between the ferrous and cuprate superconductors .",
    "the ti 3@xmath0 orbitals are occupied by one electron per ti atom , which is found to reside in a nominally 1/4-filled band formed via hybridization of the @xmath11 and @xmath12/@xmath13 orbitals for the ti(1)/ti(2 ) ions ( defined in fig .

    "these observations demonstrate that  undergoes a long - range - ordered structural phase change at @xmath17 , lowering its symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic .    to investigate the structural transition in greater detail , we performed lebail  @xcite refinements at all temperatures .",
    "we used the parent m model for @xmath24  k. the simplest possible symmetry - breaking distortion mode of the parent m structure consistent with the observed peak splitting is a mode that breaks the degeneracy of the @xmath25- and @xmath26-axes without otherwise shifting atoms within the unit cell , resulting in a space - group symmetry of @xmath22 , which was used for @xmath27  k. we also explored other candidate orthorhombic structures with lower symmetry , but since these structures do not improve the fit quality within the resolution limitations of the current data , @xmath22 is the most appropriate choice .",

    "additional details regarding rietveld refinement of  can be found in supplementary note 1 .",
    "the superconducting  shows qualitatively the same behavior , albeit with an amplitude decreased by a factor of approximately 5 , with an orthorhombic splitting ( 0.05% ) and a small but observable @xmath28-axis upturn appearing on cooling through @xmath33  50  k. the undistorted m model can be used with moderate success at all temperatures , but the @xmath22 model yields a better fit below 50  k ( see supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "pair distribution function analysis is consistent with these observations for both compounds and can be found in supplementary note 3 .",
    "these results offer compelling evidence that the observed structural response is intimately related to the transport anomaly and may be driven by a broken symmetry of the electronic system forming at that temperature .",
    "the small distortion amplitude in  explains why this long - range structural phase change escaped notice in previous neutron diffraction measurements  @xcite .",

    "the original study on the antimony endmember failed to observe superlattice peaks  @xcite .",
    "here we concentrated on the arsenic endmember where the structural distortion is five times larger , and the ed patterns were heavily overexposed to search for any weak response at intensities close to background . despite these efforts , the ed patterns taken along the [ 001 ] and [ 011 ] directions revealed no superlattice peaks in the bulk at low temperature , as shown in fig .

    "no superlattice peaks are observed at low temperature even after heavy overexposure.,width=302 ]    however , in a very small fraction of the sample in the immediate vicinity of grain boundaries , weak superlattice peaks with @xmath34 are observed at low temperature .",
    "this non - bulk behaviour is explored further in supplementary note 4 .",
    "a picture emerges of a @xmath10 symmetry breaking occurring with an accompanying strong upturn in resistivity , but with no corresponding cdw superlattice peaks appearing . the resistivity upturn is larger than would be expected as a passive response of the electronic system to the structural transition , borne out by a standard dft calculation with the observed orthorhombicity parameter @xmath35 which showed that merely 0.0003 electrons are transferred from ti(1 ) to ti(2 ) .",
    "therefore , in common with earlier discussion  @xcite , we propose that the structural transition is a response to an instability of the electronic system .",
    "the earlier muon spin relaxation results  @xcite , together with the ed measurements , allow us to rule out the existing proposals of sdw formation  @xcite or a phonon - driven cdw  @xcite . instead , an intra - unit - cell charge - nematic electronic symmetry breaking is implicated , similar to that proposed for doped cuprates  @xcite .    in the current case , a charge redistribution between the on - site orbital states at the fermi level , @xmath13/@xmath12 to @xmath11 , does not break the rotational symmetry so can be ruled out .",
    "instead , a simple but novel intra - unit - cell charge order ( iuc - co ) naturally explains the observed phenomenology . a transfer of charge from ti(1 ) to ti(2 )",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : planes](b ) ] lowers the rotational symmetry of the ti@xmath5o plaquette locally from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , with the effect on the overall lattice symmetry depending on the ordering pattern of the distinct ti ions in neighboring unit cells . repeating the symmetry - lowered plaquette uniformly along the @xmath25- and @xmath26-directions results in no change of the unit cell , but breaks the metric symmetry from @xmath36 in m to @xmath37 in @xmath22 , as observed experimentally .",
    "this arrangement of charges can accordingly be described as a nematic iuc - co .",
    "our data are therefore consistent with the formation of this type of charge order on cooling through @xmath17 .",
    "such a model is also consistent with the breaking of @xmath36 symmetry at the @xmath14 site that has been observed from @xmath21sb nuclear resonance measurements  @xcite .",
    "this nematic iuc - co is energetically favored on coulombic grounds if the onsite hubbard energy @xmath38 is sufficiently small , which is a reasonable assumption since the system is a metal rather than a mott insulator .",
    "the small hubbard @xmath38 arises from significant screening due to the solvation effect of the high polarizabilities of the as@xmath39 and sb@xmath39 anions , which are an order of magnitude larger than that of o@xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the as and sb ions reside on a lower symmetry site in the @xmath22 structure , which enhances the effects of their polarizabilities . this physics was proposed in an earlier study of the iron - pnictide superconductors  @xcite .",
    "returning to the present system , the transfer of a charge of @xmath41 from ti(1 ) to ti(2 ) will result in a lowering of the electrostatic energy , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the screened coulomb interaction between ti sites and is positive .",
    "the result is charge order with a @xmath0-wave symmetry  @xcite with the sign of the modulated charge density varying as @xmath44 around the plaquette .",
    "from plaquette to plaquette , the orientation of the axis of the distortion can be parallel or perpendicular , forming a ferro- or anti - ferro- type ordering which would preserve or break translational symmetry , respectively .",
    "the former is consistent with the experimental observations in this material .",
    "we suggest that the rather rigid face - shared octahedral topology in each layer favors the uniform ferro- over the anti - ferro- ordering .",
    "it is noteworthy that this @xmath43 is the counterpart of the coulumb repulsion @xmath45 between neighboring oxygen atoms in the cuo@xmath5 plane , which was shown to drive iuc nematic order in nonstoichiometric doped cuprates  @xcite .",
    "hence , the present results obtained on these stoichiometric materials ( thus having less ambiguity such as disorder effects ) yield insight into the origin of iuc nematic order in the cuprates .",
    "this nematic iuc - co naturally explains the observed changes in the @xmath25- and @xmath28-lattice parameters .",
    "the transfer of charge from the ti(1 ) @xmath12 orbital to ti(2 ) @xmath13 results in increased electrostatic repulsion between the charge - rich @xmath13 orbitals extending along the @xmath25-axis , breaking the tetragonal degeneracy of the @xmath25- and @xmath26-axes and leading to the observed orthorhombic distortion .",
    "furthermore , a uniform stacking of the iuc - co in each layer can also explain the response of the @xmath28-lattice parameter , which expands upon entering the charge - ordered state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fitresultbtao](a ) ] .",
    "this lattice expansion may be attributed in part to increased electrostatic repulsion between inter - layer ti ions from the transferred charge .",
    "the net energy contribution is @xmath46=v'(2 + 2\\delta ^2)$ ] , where @xmath47 is the inter - layer screened coulomb interaction .",
    "this acts in addition to other elastic energy contributions .",
    "the structural effects observed on cooling are much smaller in  than , suggesting that the iuc - co is relatively suppressed both in amplitude and temperature .",
    "this may be a result of the larger unit cell in the sb compound , due to its larger sb@xmath39 ionic diameter ( 2.25    vs. 1.98    for as@xmath39 )  @xcite , resulting in a smaller @xmath43 .",
    "to identify the microscopic driving force of this nematic instability , we present a symmetry - based zero - order analysis in which only the leading energy scales are retained .",
    "ti atoms reside at the center of a distorted octahedron with oxygen at the apices and pnictide atoms around the equatorial plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : planes](d ) for ti(1 ) .",
    "the ti @xmath48-energy levels are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : planes](e ) , similar to the case of nearly isostructural ( lao)@xmath5cose@xmath5o .",
    "@xcite the nominal electron occupation is one electron per ti atom , which would have been assigned to the locally lowest lying @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals on the ti(1 ) and ti(2 ) ions , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath49-bonding between the ti(1 ) and ti(2 ) @xmath11 orbitals forms a relatively wide band that overlaps the locally lowest level .",
    "therefore , the minimum model for the titanium oxypnictides involves the two orbitals : @xmath12 and @xmath11 on ti(1 ) and @xmath13 and @xmath11 on ti(2 ) .",
    "since the @xmath11 orbital has the same impact on both the @xmath25 and @xmath26 direction , the @xmath10 symmetry lowering around the central oxygen atom is mainly determined by the charge imbalance between the quasi - one - dimensional @xmath12 band on ti(1 ) and @xmath13 on ti(2 ) as a result of the stoner instability  @xcite .",
