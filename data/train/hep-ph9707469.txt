    "<S> we compute the @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution at large transverse momentum at fixed next - to - leading order ( i.e. @xmath1 ) and find good agreement with the preliminary measurements reported by d . </S>",

    "<S> the data appears to indicate larger values of @xmath6 than those obtained in next - to - leading order qcd predictions for the same quantity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there have already been several suggested explanations for this excess . </S>",
    "<S> for example , balzs and yuan @xcite have considered the effect of soft gluon resummation on the related quantity @xmath7 , @xmath16 new physics effects are also possible and choudhury _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have considered the effect that a massive vector boson with the quantum numbers of both a @xmath0 boson and a gluon would have on the observed value of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a more mundane explanation is that an increase in the gluon parton distribution at medium bjorken @xmath17 values would boost the @xmath0 +  1 jet rate , which receives contributions from @xmath18 scattering , while having little effect on the zero jet rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss the relationship between the large transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0 boson , for which the d collaboration recently reported a preliminary measurement @xcite , and the @xmath6 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the extent to which we can accurately theoretically predict each of these quantities .    at leading order in perturbative qcd the large @xmath19 distribution of the @xmath0 boson </S>",
    "<S> is given by the @xmath0 recoiling against a single parton . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the parton will hadronize into an observed jet , with the jet @xmath20 balancing the @xmath0 transverse momentum , so that , @xmath21 beyond lowest order this relationship is no longer strictly true at the parton level , however it makes the quantity @xmath7 worth studying in the context of the measured d excess in @xmath6 . at the moment d make no direct measurement of the @xmath7 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a different analysis @xcite they have made a preliminary measurement of the normalised transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0,@xmath22 , and from this measurement we can construct @xmath7 , @xmath23     +    the first question we wish to address is the following . does the measured d @xmath0 @xmath19 distribution show a similar excess to @xmath24 when compared with perturbative qcd predictions ? in figure [ fig : ptw ] we show the measured d @xmath2 distribution @xcite for @xmath25 as well as the fixed next - to - leading order ( i.e. @xmath26 ) theoretical predictions using the parton level monte carlo program dyrad @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the @xmath0 is tagged in its decay into an electron and neutrino , where the neutrino is detected though the presence of a significant amount of missing @xmath20 . to match onto the experimental analysis , we apply the cuts , @xmath27 to trigger on the event . </S>",
    "<S> jets are defined with a conesize @xmath28 and may lie in the rapidity range , @xmath29 @xcite . to simulate the experimental jet algorithm , we cluster all pairs of partons that lie within @xmath30 of each other to form a proto jet , then test that all clustered partons lie within @xmath31 of the proto jet @xcite . as a default parameter , we set @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the jet direction and transverse energy is constructed using the d recombination procedure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron must also be isolated from significant amounts of hadronic energy and we simulate the isolation criteria by imposing , @xmath33 throughout we use the cteq4 m parton densities @xcite with @xmath34 unless stated otherwise and set the renormalisation scale , at which @xmath35 is evaluated , equal to the factorisation scale , at which the parton densities are evaluated . for this joint scale </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath36 for the three choices @xmath37 and @xmath2 corresponding to a medium , hard and soft scale , at next - to - leading order ( i.e. @xmath38 ) and with a scale @xmath39 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the theoretical prediction is only mildly sensitive to the choice of scale , which gives us confidence in the prediction for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is clear that the @xmath1 prediction gives an adequate description of the preliminary d data . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the effect of smearing either the jet @xmath20 or @xmath2 is not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> such smearing can either arise from multiple soft gluon emission @xcite @xcite , which is much less than the bin width ( @xmath41 ) used in the theoretical calculation . ] , or from experimental mismeasurement of the energy of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> second , given the excess of the observed @xmath6 ratio over the dyrad predictions , we would naively have expected the theoretical predictions to fall short for the @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution as well .    </S>",
    "<S> of course , the @xmath6 ratio is directly related to the one - jet exclusive @xmath20 distribution rather than the @xmath0 boson transverse momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we show both of these quantities in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dsdx ] . </S>",
    "<S> for illustrative purposes , we also show the one - jet inclusive and second - jet @xmath20 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> as we might expect , we see that the inclusive one - jet transverse energy distribution is very similar to the inclusive @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution . at leading order , </S>",
    "<S> these two distributions are identical and this relationship is largely preserved at next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> the one - jet exclusive distribution is suppressed relative to the one - jet inclusive rate because in some events the second parton is identified as a jet . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is described by the @xmath20 distribution of the second jet ( short dashed line ) . from this plot </S>",
    "<S> , we anticipate that from the theoretical point of view , the @xmath24 ratio constructed from the single jet exclusive distribution will be somewhat smaller than the @xmath7 ratio determined from the @xmath0 boson @xmath19 distribution for given @xmath42 values less than around 120  gev . as mentioned earlier , in the theoretical dyrad prediction the effect of soft gluon radiation or hadron mismeasurements on either the jet @xmath20 or the @xmath0 @xmath2 is not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> such smearing will generally lead to an increase in the jet @xmath20 and @xmath0 @xmath2 and hence on both the @xmath43 and @xmath6 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> however because @xmath7 is sensitive to measurements on all hadrons / gluons in the scattering , whilst @xmath6 is only affected by hadrons / gluons that lie within the jet , we might expect the effect of smearing to increase the @xmath7 distribution more than the @xmath6 distribution .    in order to make the difference between the preliminary d measurements for @xmath6 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 more transparent , we convert the measured transverse momentum distribution into @xmath7 using equation [ eq : ptwtorw ] . to estimate the experimental errors on @xmath7 we make the assumption that there are no common systematic errors and merely add the errors in the @xmath36 distribution in quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> we show the extracted @xmath7 data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rwvsr10 ] , as well as the d measurement for @xmath6 and the next - to - leading order predictions for both quantities . </S>",
    "<S> note that in extracting @xmath24 , events may only contribute to the @xmath0 + 1 jet cross section when there is exactly one jet observed with @xmath20 above @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath0 + 0 jet cross section is constructed from events with no jets observed with an @xmath20 greater than @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the denominators for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are identical at next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from our discussion of the raw @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution , the theoretical prediction for @xmath7 is consistent with the extracted experimental value , although possibly slightly low because of the cumulative effect of events at higher @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that , for a given @xmath44 , the measured @xmath6 value lies above the experimental @xmath7 value . on the other hand , the corresponding next - to - leading order prediction for @xmath6 systematically lies below the @xmath7 value . </S>",
    "<S> this is the observed discrepancy between the measured @xmath6 value and the dyrad prediction . in the case of the theoretical prediction </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be traced back to the fact that the numerator of @xmath6 in the d definition @xcite is the one - jet exclusive rate . </S>",
    "<S> while the experimental uncertainties in @xmath6 and @xmath7 are somewhat different , the exclusive nature of @xmath6 ensures that the next - to - leading order predictions will lie beneath those of @xmath7 for @xmath45  gev . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the gluonic content of the proton or adding new heavy objects @xcite will affect both @xmath6 and @xmath7 but will not change this hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that if the numerator of @xmath6 is replaced with the @xmath0 +  1 jet inclusive rate , then the dyrad predictions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are almost identical .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the question of how reliable the predictions for @xmath24 and @xmath7 are under variations of the renormalisation / factorisation scale . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : r10scale ] we show the relative change compared to @xmath46 for a soft scale , @xmath47 or @xmath48 respectively , a hard scale , @xmath49 and simple multiples of moderate scales @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that changes of @xmath52 are possible which are clearly not enough to account for the difference between the dyrad prediction for @xmath6 and the d measurement . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 have a similar behaviour under these scale changes , and the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath7 is relatively insensitive to the changes of scales .    </S>",
    "<S> given that the prediction for @xmath7 does fit the experimental measurement so well , we should search for the ways in which the @xmath24 measurement differs from the @xmath7 measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the only major difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is that for the @xmath6 measurement experimental jets must be formed , whereas this is not necessary for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> as dyrad gives a next - to - leading order prediction for @xmath6 it includes configurations where two partons get clustered into a single jet , and this gives it a non trivial dependence on the jet definition . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally jets are formed from many hadrons , whereas inside dyrad jets are made from at most two partons , and the difference between these can lead to a mismatch between jet algorithms at the hadron and parton levels . </S>",
    "<S> for example an experiment might choose to cluster all hadrons within some @xmath53-@xmath54 distance @xmath31 from the centre of a jet . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we theoretically only cluster partons that lie within an @xmath53-@xmath54 distance of @xmath31 of each other then the theoretical jet will never contain partons up to a distance @xmath31 away from the centre of the jet . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we could cluster _ all _ pairs of partons to form a proto jet , and then test if the partons clustered lie inside a distance of @xmath31 of the proto jet direction for the proto jet to remain a genuine jet . </S>",
    "<S> this again is far from the experimental procedure , as there is no `` seed tower '' in the direction around which the proto jet is first formed . in order to understand this difference between the experimental and theoretical definition of a jet we use two extreme jet clustering algorithms in addition to the default algorithm described earlier with @xmath32 .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> * narrow : * cluster two partons if they lie within some @xmath31 of each other corresponding to @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   * </S>",
    "<S> wide : * cluster all pairs of partons to form a proto jet and then test that all clustered partons lie within some @xmath31 of the proto jet direction corresponding to @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the narrow and wide jet clustering definitions correspond to the narrowest and widest theoretical implementation of the experimental jet definition . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : r10clus - as ] we show the dependence of the @xmath6 prediction on the parton level jet clustering . </S>",
    "<S> different jet clusterings vary the theoretical prediction by only a few percent which is certainly not enough to be able to explain the measured @xmath6 excess . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 ratio shows very little dependence on the type of jet clustering chosen , arising only from the isolation cut on the observed electron .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we show the dependence of the @xmath6 ratio on the value of @xmath35 used in figure [ fig : r10clus - as ] . </S>",
    "<S> as d have noted @xcite the dependence is less than expected due to a cancellation between the @xmath35 dependence of the parton distributions and the hard scattering . </S>",
    "<S> here we only note in addition that the uncertainty coming from the experimental definition of a jet is typically similar to the variation in the rate coming from @xmath35 , and so without an accurate understanding of exactly how to model jet clustering we do not expect measurements of @xmath6 to be useful in constraining @xmath35 . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> we feel that measurements of @xmath7 ( or better still the analogous ratio from @xmath57 boson events ) would be a more reliable theoretical method for measuring @xmath35 as it is largely free from the ambiguities of defining jets .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have found good agreement between the @xmath0 boson @xmath19 distribution as reported by d and fixed order perturbative calculations . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we find no way to reconcile the @xmath6 ratio measured by the d collaboration with the same theoretical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , because the @xmath24 ratio is exclusive in the number of jets , we see that for a given value of @xmath58 , the predicted value for @xmath6 always lies beneath that for @xmath7 in the currently measured range . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be in contradiction with the preliminary experimental results . </S>"
