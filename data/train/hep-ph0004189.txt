    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is nowadays well established as the theory of strong interaction within the standard model of elementary particle physics . in recent years",
    "there has been a wealth of theoretical results ( for a review see  @xcite ) . at the same time perturbative qcd",
    "has been extremely successful in describing the experimental data with high precision .",
    "the fundamental quantity of qcd is the so - called beta function which connects the value of the strong coupling constant , @xmath6 , at different energy scales @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus particularly important to know the beta function as precise as possible . in",
    "@xcite the four - loop corrections were evaluated allowing for a consistent running at order @xmath7 . in the majority of all computations performed in qcd",

    ", four - loop running must go along with the three - loop decoupling relation which was evaluated in  @xcite .",
    "similar considerations are also valid for quark masses . also here",
