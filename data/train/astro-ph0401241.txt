    "the interacting pair of galaxies ngc  4038/39 ( the antennae ) , at a distance of 19  mpc ( @xmath2 ) , has been studied intensely at all wavelengths as the nearest example of galaxies undergoing a major merger ( e.g. , whitmore et al .  1999 ; hibbard et al .  2001 ; neff & ulvestad 2000 ; wilson et al .",
    "2000 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "the antennae provide a local laboratory where astronomers can easily observe phenomena that occur in the deeper universe .",
    "there , merging is common and may be an important step in the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) .",
    "the antennae have been studied in x - rays since their first observation with _ einstein _",
    "( fabbiano & trinchieri 1983 ) .",
    "the first _ chandra _",
    "acis - s ( weisskopf et al.2000 ) observation of this system in december 1999 revealed both a population of exceptionally luminous point - like sources and complex hot diffuse emission with temperatures in the range @xmath3 0.30.8  kev .",
    "this hot gaseous emission is particularly luminous in the regions with the most active star formation ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2001 ; zezas et al .",
    "2002a , b ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2003c ) . based on these results ,",
    "our team was awarded a deep monitoring campaign of the antennae with _",
    "chandra _ , which took place in 20012002 , and yielded a total 114  hr exposure , including the original 1999 december data .",
    "preliminary reports of spectral and flux variability of the most luminous x - ray sources in the antennae are given in fabbiano et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) .    in this letter",
    "we present the entire deep data set and give a first report on the spectral analysis of the diffuse emission , made possible by the exceptional signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra .",
    "the main result is the discovery of large spatial variations and enhancements of the metal abundances .",
    "previous attempts at measuring the metallicity of the hot ism with the december 1999 data were inconclusive ( fabbiano et al .",
    "we also report on the large - scale properties of the diffuse emission : while the first _",
    "observations already suggested gaseous diffuse emission south of the system ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2001 ) , the new deep image reveals complex large - scale features .",
    "together with the original observation , the total _ chandra _",
    "acis - s exposure on the antennae is 411  ks , after background flare screening . the standard level 2 event files obtained by the standard data processing ( sdp ) were used .",
    "the data set consists of seven observations ( @xmath4 : 315 , 3040 , 3041 , 3042 , 3043 , 3044 , 3718 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the astrometry - corrected and co - added ` raw ' data .",
    "details of the data reduction procedures are given in fabbiano et al .",

    "( 2003 , in preparation ) and baldi et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "ciao v3.0.1 and xspec were used for the data analysis .",
    "the latest acis gain calibration was applied .",
    "figure  2 shows an adaptively - smoothed true - color image , obtained from data in the 0.30.65 , 0.651.5 and 1.56.0  kev energy bands .",
    "this spectacular image shows both a population of point - like sources and diffuse emission with a variety of spatial scales and spectral colors .",
    "we will discuss elsewhere our detailed results on the point - source population ( zezas et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) . in summary ,",
    "we detect 120 sources ( @xmath5 ) , with 0.310.0  kev luminosities in the range @xmath6@xmath7   for an assumed power - law spectrum with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( galactic ) . of the sources more luminous than the eddington luminosity of a neutron star ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath170% are variable .",
    "below , we concentrate on the most striking features of the diffuse soft emission , which is detected mostly below 1.5  kev .",
    "because of its spectrum , this emission is likely to be thermal emission from hot plasmas ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2001 , 2003c ) .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show that this emission is most intense in those areas within the optical bodies of the galaxies that coincide with the most actively star - forming regions .",
    "figure  2 illustrates that this hot ism is rich in features , both spatially and spectrally , as suggested by the varied range of x - ray colors .",
    "larger - scale , more diffuse emission is also present , and includes two 10  kpc - size ( 110  at d=19  mpc ) loop - like structures extending to the south of the main body of emission .",
    "the x - ray spectra extracted from different regions of the hot ism show a variety of continuum shapes and line - emission strengths ( see baldi et al .",
    "2003 for a complete study ) .",
    "in particular , besides the fe - l complex ( @xmath10.651.15  kev ) , lines of ne x ( 0.92  kev ) , mg xi - xii ( 1.341.47  kev ) , and si xiii - xiv ( 1.852.01  kev ) are visible in some of the spectra .",
    "figure  3 shows a _ metallicity map _ of the hot ism .",
    "the abundance of the above elements varies widely in different regions , exceeding in places that of our local solar neighborhood .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc  1569 have led to the detection of large - scale metal - enriched hot winds ( martin et al.2002 ) . our deep _",
    "data allow for the first time the detailed correlation of metal abundances with different galaxian regions and the stellar populations .",
    "table  1 summarizes the spectral properties of three regions ( out of 21 regions studied in baldi et al .",
    "2003 ) , representative of the range of abundances .",
    "they are marked in figure  3 with ` 1 ' , ` 5 ' and ` 7 ' .",
    "we follow the numbering convention of baldi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for these regions , and we name them with r1 , r5 and r7 in this paper . we fitted the spectra using the most complete thermal model available to us , the apec model ( smith et al .  2001 ) .",
    "an intrinsic variable n@xmath11 was fitted , in addition to the fixed line - of - sight galactic n@xmath11 .",
    "a power - law was also included in the fits to represent harder sources such as undetected x - ray binaries or young supernova remnants ( snr ) , and yielded best - fit @xmath12 in the range 1.82 .",
    "table  1 also lists mean stellar ages of the regions , estimated via a number - weighted average of the mean ages of highly reddened , extremely young clusters ( 4 myr ; zhang , fall , & whitmore 2001 ) and young blue clusters ( 15 myr ; whitmore et al .  1999 ) , and the relative strength of the star formation rate ( sfr ) as measured by the index ( u+h@xmath0)/(v+i ) .",
    "r1 consists of two metal - poor regions in the northern loop of the disk of ngc  4038 .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show a plume extending out of ngc  4038 near the western region , suggesting possible outflows .",
    "r5 , within the disk of ngc  4038 , is a half - shell feature of the hot ism and has the most impressive emission lines .",
    "the spectrum and best - fit model ( with residuals ) are shown in figure  4 .",
    "this region is also the one with the highest relative sfr and , given its small area , the largest sfr per unit area .",
    "r7 is the absorbed region corresponding to the co - rich `` overlap region , '' where the most recent , intense star formation is occurring ( wilson et al .",
    "2000 ; see fabbiano et al .",
    "2003c ) . the mean age of this region is based on optically detected clusters , so it may represent an upper limit on the stellar age of the inner obscured regions .",
    "the relative sfr is large , but not as high as that of r5 .    in both r5 and r7",
    "the @xmath0-elements are relatively more prominent than iron , consistent with enrichment by the sne of type ii expected in a young stellar population .",
    "while we can not draw any strong conclusions based on only three points , table  1 may suggest a trend between relative sfr and @xmath0-element abundances .",
    "the low abundances of r1 may also in part be due to the presence of outflows , which may disperse the element - enriched hot ism outside of the galaxy .    while the presence of metals in the hot ism is certain , the values of the abundances are somewhat model - dependent . for",
    "the static model , the radiative cooling time ( @xmath13 years ) is longer than the relevant recombination time ( @xmath14 years ) , and it is self - consistent to assume ionization equilibrium . if the x - rays come from a collection of snrs , there could be some departure from equilibrium , but overionized and underionized regions will tend to cancel out . if there is a wind , there could be significant adiabatic cooling , so the ionization state would be that appropriate for a higher temperature and abundances could be overestimated ( e.g. , breitschwerdt 2003 ) . that might affect the derived abundances for the low - temperature regions far out in the halo , but high density regions such as r5 should not be greatly affected .",
    "r5 is remarkable for its high concentration of young star clusters .",
    "it is possible that the young clusters are still injecting kinetic energy predominantly by means of stellar winds in this region , and that the temperature will increase as the sn rate increases ( gilbert 2002 ) .",
    "it seems equally likely that the heated gas has entrained a large amount of cooler material , and that as the region evolves the mean temperature will increase as the cool material is blown away .",
    "at larger radii , fig .",
    "2 shows soft diffuse emission without any obvious stellar / optical counterparts ( ponman et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "we can identify two components of this emission : ( i ) two spectacular extended structures , suggesting giant loops or bubbles of hot plasma ( the loops , hereafter ) , @xmath110  kpc across , extending south of ngc  4039 , and ( ii ) a low - surface - brightness soft halo in the region surrounding the stellar disks of the merging galaxies , extending out to at least 18  kpc ( @xmath1200 ) from the nucleus of ngc  4039 .",
    "the latter is not clearly shown in figure  2 , but is revealed at high significance by comparisons of the radial distribution of the x - ray counts , with those expected from a field background ( fig .",
    "5 ) .    the spectra of the loops can be fitted with a thermal plasma with kt varying between 0.29 kev and 0.34 kev ( @xmath15 errors of typically 0.01 to 0.03  kev ) and metallicities apparently sub - solar ( typically 0.10.2 solar ) .",
    "the extent and spectral parameters of the low - surface - brightness halo are uncertain because of the uncertainties of the background subtraction at these large radii .",
    "however , the spectra are soft , with nominal @xmath16  ( 1@xmath17 )  kev , so this larger - scale emission may be cooler than that of the loops .",
    "the best - fit metallicity is only 0.04 solar , and is @xmath18 at 90% confidence in the outer annulus .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio of the data is lower than for the hot ism , and the fits include data from large regions . while we have no reason to believe that the intrinsic spectral parameters vary significantly at these radii , we can not exclude it either .",
    "hence , these abundances are uncertain",
    ". taken at face value , there is a trend of decreasing abundances going from the hot ism of the star - forming regions to the loops , and to the larger - scale emission .",
    "this trend may be consistent with a picture in which the hot gas in the large - scale halo may have been diluted with metal - poor ambient ism .",
    "the temperature also seems to decrease at large radii , which may be due to adiabatic expansion .    what causes these large - scale features ?",
    "the extended halo may be the aftermath of superwinds from the antennae , perhaps resulting from a starburst at the first - encounter epoch @xmath1(25)@xmath19yr ago ( barnes 1988 ; mihos et al .",
    "1993 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) and the prolonged elevated star - formation rate ( 46 /yr ) of the past @xmath1150 myr ( mihos , bothun , & richstone 1993 , esp .",
    "the cooling times in these diffuse regions are @xmath11  gyr .",
    "the thermal energy content of both halo and loops is @xmath110@xmath20  erg , comparable to the energy of @xmath21 sne . given the age of the starburst of @xmath110@xmath22yr , a sn rate of 0.001 per year could have provided this energy .",
    "this is a small fraction of the current sn rate of the antennae ( 0.20.3  yr@xmath23 ; neff & ulvestad 2000 ) and , likely , of the average rate during the past @xmath1150 myr .    a simple order - of - magnitude estimate of the expansion velocity of the loops , assuming a 10  kpc extent and constant velocity over a period of @xmath24@xmath25 yr , yields a velocity of 1000100  km / s .",
    "at least velocities @xmath26300  km / s are likely to exceed the escape velocity of the system and correspond , in fact , to about the mean expansion velocity observed in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( rupke , veilleux , & sanders 2002 )",
    ". moreover , these velocities are comparable to or exceed the sound speed of @xmath1200  km  s@xmath23 we derive for this hot gas .",
    "therefore , the loops could be shocked swept - up ism . if they are superbubbles blown by a violent localized starburst ( e.g. , at the nucleus of ngc  4039 ) , as , e.g. , in the tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1988 ) model , one would expect more of a bipolar outflow morphology .",
    "they could correspond to two separate events , with perhaps the receding sides of the outflows obscured by the main body of the emission from the merger .",
    "another possibility that will need to be explored with hydrodynamical simulations , is that the loops are somehow connected with the merging process , as suggested in the case of arp  220 , where similar structures are observed with _",
    "( mcdowell et al .  2003 ) .",
    "we note that a large - scale ring of hot gaseous emission is present in ngc  5128 , a likely merger remnant ( karovska et al .",
    "2002 ) .    given the long cooling times of both loops and halo in the antennae , it seems possible that  if these features are bound by a dark massive halo ",
    "they may persist after the completion of the merger and the formation of the resulting elliptical galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the total mass of hot gas in these extended features is @xmath1@xmath27 .",
    "this mass is comparable with that reported from x - ray observations of relatively x - ray faint elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. , roberts et al .",
    "the above results demonstrate the power of sensitive , high - resolution x - ray observations .",
    "thanks to a deep 411  ks observation of the antennae , we now have a first picture of the varying chemical enrichment of the ism , and we can see this hot medium expanding into the intergalactic space and possibly enriching the intergalactic medium with metals . given the long cooling time of the extended halo , these observations may also show the formation of the hot halo of the elliptical galaxy that will be created by the merger .",
    "these data provide a new , welcome opportunity to witness the chemical evolution of galaxies in action , and offer a nearby glimpse of the distant evolving universe .",
