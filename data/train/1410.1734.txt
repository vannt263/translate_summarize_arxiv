    "the existence of the majoranas at boundaries can be shown to be related to the topology of the bulk bandstructure.@xcite there now exists a large variety of theoretical models which possess majorana states in 1d , quasi 1d , and 2d systems.@xcite    in the experimental systems spin - orbit coupling is crucial for the existence of the topologically non - trivial regime . however , it is also possible to create the necessary physics with a nonuniform magnetic field . in the reference frame of the magnetic field",
    "this inhomogeneity is naturally very similar to a spin - orbit interaction .",
    "one proposal to realize such inhomogenous field configurations is to deposit magnetic atoms on a superconducting substrate,@xcite which has also been checked experimentally.@xcite the bound states that form at the magnetic impurities , called shiba states , then form a lattice of non - uniform magnetic moments.@xcite helical magnetism gives rise to similar phenomena.@xcite instead of focusing on a particular origin for the inhomogeneous magnetic fields we consider the magnetic inhomogeneity as a free parameter and explore the phase space as a function of possible forms of inhomogeneity .",
    "this allows one to locate the phases in which majorana bound states can form .",
    "we are interested in 2d superconducting systems in the d and bdi class in the usual classification .",
    "a gapped superconductor in the topological class d can be in either a topologically trivial or non - trivial phase described in 2d by a @xmath0 invariant@xcite . without closing the gap it is impossible to change from one phase to the other .",
    "it can be demonstrated that a topologically non - trivial system has edge states at the boundaries.@xcite in our case these are zero energy majorana states and always come in pairs .",
    "a bdi system on the other hand has , strictly speaking , no topological ground state in 2d .",
    "in this case we can map particular configurations to a set of effective 1d bdi wires each of which is characterised by a @xmath0 invariant .",
    "the topological ground state is protected only in so far as the effective wires remain independent . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to consider the parity of the relevant @xmath0 invariant , which is itself a @xmath1 invariant which takes the values @xmath2 or @xmath3 in the topologically trivial and non - trivial phases respectively .",
    "the existence of multiple edge states can be understood through the concept of ` weak ' topology .",
    "if the system has translational invariance along one direction , with boundaries parallel to this direction , then by performing a 1-d fourier transform the 2-d system can be decomposed into a set of independent 1-d systems .",
    "each one labelled by the appropriate quantum number .",
    "each of these independent 1-d systems can in principle be either topologically trivial or non - trivial labelled by its own invariant @xmath4 , and thus , via the bulk - boundary correspondence , either host edge states or not as appropriate . by calculating the bulk topological invariant for each 1-d hamiltonian",
    "we can find the total number of edge states for a 2-d lattice with specific boundaries .",
    "the existence of many such edge states , which are not fully protected , we refer to as weak topology .",
    "the resulting plots which show the number of majorana edge states we refer to as weak topological phase diagrams , though strictly speaking it is of course not a phase diagram for the full system .",
    "multiple majorana bound states have already been predicted in several systems .",
    "quasi 1-d many - band wires can host a small number of majorana states at the ends of the wire.@xcite ladders and coupled chains also allow one to build up models with multiple majoranas by combining the edge states existing for wires.@xcite flat bands of andreev bound states@xcite have been predicted to occur at the edge of 2-d topological superconductors , and dispersionless bands of majorana states will occur in the edge of 2-d square lattices provided the spin orbit coupling parallel to the edge can be neglected.@xcite flat bands have been predicted in several alternative systems such as ( @xmath5+@xmath6)-wave topological superconductors,@xcite and ( @xmath7 ) superconductors.@xcite flat bands of majoranas in systems with s - wave coupling have been studied in spin - orbit coupled systems.@xcite the set - up we consider here , where spin - orbit coupling is played by the magnetic inhomogeneity of shiba states has received only limited attention@xcite and no detailed examination of the stability of the flat bands or their topology exists . in this paper",
    "we address these issues for a range of magnetic inhomogeneity and lattice structures .",
    "the systems we consider have two possible realizations : magnetic adatoms on a surface , or a 2-d lattice with an externally created inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "magnetic adatoms on a superconducting substrate will have a very low hopping parameter and thus a small bandwidth .",
    "this allows one to access what would otherwise be very high magnetic fields and chemical potentials , measured in units of the hopping . in general we show results for a large range of parameters to make the structure of the phase diagrams clear . in the case of real solid state lattices",
    "only a small portion would be experimentally accessible .",
    "the superconducting gap would also then be orders of magnitude smaller than that used in the figures here .",
    "we have chosen the values to aid numerical computation and visualization , but the choice makes no difference to the underlying physics . in comparison to lattices with rashba coupling",
    ", one advantage of the model used here is that majoranas can be found for much smaller dopings ( chemical potentials ) and magnetic field strengths .",
    "we find flat bands of majorana edge states for a wide range of magnetic fields and parameters , in both square and hexagonal lattices .",

    "note here that for @xmath24 then the square lattice has a bandwidth of @xmath25 , while the hexagonal lattice has a bandwidth of @xmath26 and a van - hove singularity at @xmath27 .",
    "crucially the hamiltonians we consider anti - commute with the particle hole operator @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is complex conjugation and @xmath30 is an arbitrary phase : @xmath31 .",
    "this ensures that any pair of zero energy states in the system can be written as a pair of majorana states .",
    "in addition we normally have the property @xmath32 where @xmath33 , though its exact form will depend on the magnetic field used .",
    "this particular @xmath34 is valid for a magnetic field confined to the @xmath35 spin plane .",
    "this additional property means that majoranas on a single edge of the system do not hybridize and destroy each other.@xcite as we shall see in sec .  [ sec_stab ] breaking this symmetry , by using a non - planar magnetic field , has consequences for the stability of the majorana states .",
    "the first step is to remove the magnetic inhomogeneity by an appropriate gauge transformation@xcite which will introduce an effective spin - orbit coupling into the lattice . if we parameterize the orientation as @xmath36 then a rotation @xmath37 which diagonalizes the magnetic field term such that @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 we begin by assuming that the magnetic field is rotating in a single plane in spin space and along a single orientation in real space , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "as neither @xmath42 nor @xmath43 make any difference to the physics under investigation we make the further simplification @xmath44 and @xmath45 , such that the magnetic field is in - plane .",
    "the condition @xmath46 will be relaxed later . for the most part we focus on the effects of changing the real space direction given by @xmath47 and we use the phrase ` orientation of the magnetic field ' to refer to this real space direction .",
    "this gauge transformation results in the hamiltonian @xmath48 , where the last term is generated from the kinetic energy : @xmath49 .",

    "this is due to the diagonal and spin symmetric component of scattering from the inhomogeneous zeeman field .",
    "although it is possible to write an effective low - energy theory which can capture most features of the majorana states , the full topological phase diagram information can only be gained by treating the band structure correctly at the appropriate points .",
    "the effective spin - orbit interaction has some different properties from the intrinsic rashba spin - orbit interaction which is present when inversion symmetry is broken . a rashba coupling of strength @xmath57 , @xmath58 preserves , up to an appropriate spin rotation , the underlying rotational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "however , the effective coupling given in eq .  , because of the form of the rotating field , automatically breaks this symmetry .",
    "one consequence of this is that it is possible to construct edges which are parallel to the direction along which the effective spin - orbit acts .",
    "this is impossible for a real rashba interaction . conversely it is also possible for it to act exactly perpendicular to an edge ,",
    "again this is not possible for rashba . as we shall see in secs .",
    "[ sec_square ] and [ sec_hexagonal ] this has consequences for the weak topological phases of the systems . due to the different underlying symmetry",
    "it is not possible to map the kind of inhomogeneous field we consider to rashba coupling in 2-d .",
