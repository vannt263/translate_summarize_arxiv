    "recently two of the authors have proposed  @xcite a scenario for a cyclic universe based on a dark energy component with constant equation of state satisfying @xmath9 where @xmath10 and hence @xmath2 .",
    "the model involves two key ideas : ( i ) that the universe deflate just prior to the turnaround from expansion to contraction by disintegrating into a very large number @xmath0 of causal patches . in the notation of @xcite , note that @xmath11 ; ( ii ) that the contracting universe be empty , meaning that one causal patch at turnaround must contain no matter or black holes , only dark energy",
    "this is called the cbe condition ( _ comes back empty _ ) .",
    "implementation of cbe requires , as we shall explain , a lower bound on @xmath12 which depends on the length scale @xmath13 characterising the smallest bound system .",
    "we shall consider both @xmath14 m for a nucleon then @xmath15 m for a ppp ( _ presently point particle _ ) meaning a particle which at present is considered to be pointlike , like a quark or a lepton , but which actually has a characteristic size at least a few orders of magnitude smaller than a nucleon but greater than or equal to the planck scale .    in the foreseeable future , it is expected that the equation of state of the dark energy @xmath16 , and hence @xmath3 , will be measured with higher accuracy by , for example , the planck surveyor satellite  @xcite .",
    "what we shall show is that this measurement can , within this model , constrain for a given @xmath16 the number @xmath0 of causal patches at turnaround by imposing a lower bound thereon .",
    "the plan of the paper is that in section 2 we discuss the times at which unbinding , causal disconnection and turnaround occur . in section 3 ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 from measurement of @xmath3 are derived .",
    "finally , section 4 is a discussion . in the appendices is technical material to supplement the main text .",
    "in this section we analyze four relationships between cosmic times in the cyclic model expansion era : i ) @xmath17 ( at which a bound system will become unbound due to the large dark energy force with @xmath18 ) ; ii ) @xmath19 ( at which a previously bound system becomes casually disconnected , meaning that no light signal could exchange before the would - be big rip ; this is how we estimate @xmath0 ) ; iii ) @xmath20 ( time when the turnaround occurs ) ; iv ) @xmath21 ( at which a  would - be \" big rip takes place ) , in addition to the present time @xmath22 .    in the baum - frampton ( bf ) model  @xcite , there are three parameters ; @xmath16 ( equation of state of dark energy ) ; @xmath23 ( critical density which the total density in the system @xmath24 reached at @xmath25 ) ; @xmath26 ( the deflation fraction parameter related to the number of causal patches by @xmath27 )",
    ". we will analyze the model taking the value of @xmath16 lying in a range , @xmath28 and for @xmath23 choosing the following range , @xmath29 the choice of the range of @xmath16 is motivated by the current lower bound from observations  @xcite and the upper bound , by the cosmic variance uncertainty in this measurement .    reserving details of the derivation of four formulas to appendix a",
    ", we shall here refer to the resultant expressions :    * @xmath30 + @xmath31 * @xmath32 + @xmath33 + where  @xcite @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the period associated with the binding force which had been constraining objects into a certain bound system before @xmath36",

    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis for these relationships is presented in appendices a and b. as a result , we find the lower bound for @xmath23 , @xmath46 which is obtained by imposing that the time for a presently point particle ( ppp ) , with the size @xmath47",
    "m = l , satisfy @xmath48 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this result is almost independent of a choice of @xmath16 in the range of interest .    for a nucleon with @xmath49 m ,",
    "the corresponding lower bound is @xmath50",
    "in @xcite , as in @xcite , various bound systems were discussed including galaxies , the earth - sun system , the hydrogen atom and a nucleon .",
    "each may be charaterised by a present length scale @xmath51 .    for the cbe condition we must insist that the smallest bound systems are disintegrated before turnaround which means that the size of a generic causal patch @xmath52 ( to be defined below ) is smaller than the size @xmath53 at turnaround of the bound system whose present length scale is @xmath54 , namely    @xmath55    we remind the reader that the cbe condition is mandatory because if the contracting universe contains matter it will not generally contract sufficiently but will undergo a premature bounce .",
    "even if a causal patch contains only one very infra - red photon , this can blue - shift to an energy sufficient to create @xmath56 pairs before the bounce , again disallowing sufficient contraction for infinite cyclicity .",
    "this was the motivation for @xcite where it was shown that the mean number of low - energy photons per causal patch is much less than one and is essentially zero .",
    "there will always be a vanishing but strictly non - zero number of patches which fail to cycle but it was shown in @xcite that the probability of a successful universe is equal to one ; it was noted that the total number of universes has always been , and always will be constantly infinite and equal to @xmath57 ( aleph - zero ) .",
    "@xmath57 is a countable infinity , exemplified by the number of primes , of integers or of rational numbers .    to enable infinite cyclicity",
    "we must have the cbe condition , eq.([cbe ] ) , for the smallest bound systems .",
    "the smallest bound systems we know about are nucleons with @xmath58 m .    to be general , we consider ppps ( _ presently point particles _ ) meaning particles which are presently regarded as pointlike but may not be .",
    "we allow a bound state scale for ppps to be anywhere between the present upper limit of about @xmath59 m and the planck scale of @xmath8 m . as we shall see shortly , the lower bound on @xmath0 is so sensitive to where @xmath51 is chosen within these twenty orders of magnitude that its presentation requires us to plot @xmath60 against the equation of state of the dark energy .     and",
    "@xmath0 coming from the cbe condition ( comes back empty ) , corresponding to inequality ( [ cbe ] ) .",
    "the black band in this figure has been created by varying the length of smaller bound systems from @xmath61 m to @xmath62 m ; the bottom edge corresponds to the lower value of @xmath63 .",

    "the black band in this figure has been created by varying the length of smaller bound systems from @xmath61 m to @xmath62 m ; the bottom edge corresponds to the lower value of @xmath63 .",

    "is instead defined by @xmath68 and therefore eq.([cbe ] ) can be calculated for different values of @xmath51 , see appendix c. the results are illustrated in figure 1 where we plot @xmath60 versus @xmath69 .    from this figure",
    "we see that a measurement of @xmath16 in the range anticipated for the planck surveyor will provide a lower bound on @xmath0 . for example",
    "@xmath70 implies @xmath71 for disintegration of nucleons and @xmath72 for disintegration of ppps with bound scale at the planck length .",
    "since we know the entropy of the present universe is at least @xmath73 @xcite one must impose @xmath74 and , by requiring only the dissociation of nucleons we see from figure 2 that this implies    @xmath75    of course , wmap data  @xcite already guarantee this condition but it is interesting that the cyclic model of @xcite would be impossible if eq.([w2 ] ) had been violated .",
    "what we have deduced is that the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath0 in cyclic cosmology are already constrained by existing data .",
    "for example one requires @xmath77 for the cbe aspect to work .",
    "this constraint is already known to be respected in nature but as better and more accurate cosmological data become available it will shed further light on the viability of the theory .    in particular , the accurate measurement of the equation of state @xmath69 is of special interest .",
    "fortunately the planck surveyor  @xcite is anticipated to acquire improved accuracy on @xmath16 in the near future .",
    "as we have discussed , this will provide a lower bound on the number @xmath0 of causal patches necessary to dissociate the smallest bound systems at turnaround and hence to solve the entropy problem and , via cbe , enable the possibility of infinite cyclicity .",
    "it is amusing that the physical conditions at the approach of deflation are so extraordinary that it is natural to ask whether the systems presently regarded as point particles may be composite because the phantom dark energy density grows to unimaginably large values and can disintegrate bound systems down to arbitrarily small scales .",
    "we have conservatively limited our attention to systems bigger than the planck length . however , although this requirement seems dictated by considerations of quantum gravity , it is possible that the dark energy will dissociate even smaller systems if they exist .",
    "the advantage of cyclic cosmology is that it removes the initial singularity associated with the big bang , about 13.7 billion years ago , and allows that time never began .",
    "the previous attempts to create a consistent infinite cyclicity were stymied between about 1934  @xcite and 2002  @xcite primarily because of the entropy problem and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion rate of the universe and the concomitant necessity of dark energy has permitted more optimism that the cyclic cosmology is , after all , on the right track .",
