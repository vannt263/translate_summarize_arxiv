    "inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) has become an important tool for investigating the elementary excitations of nanoscale systems  @xcite .",
    "an excitation manifests itself as an abrupt change in the differential conductance of a two - probe device as the voltage sweeps across the excitation energy .",
    "this is the result of the opening of a new inelastic transport channel for the electron tunneling . as the energy of the probed excitation sets the critical voltage and the temperature range where to observe iets",
    ", it is not surprising that the first experiments were all related to molecular vibrations of relatively high energy @xcite .",
    "more recently the continuous advances in low - temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) have enabled the detection of excitations of different origin , namely those related to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "this different type of spectroscopy is usually named spin - flip iets ( sf - iets ) .",
    "the first measurements of sf - iets were for single atoms randomly deposited on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "however , stm techniques also open the possibility of assembling and manipulating entire nano - structures  @xcite and of positioning magnetic ions on a surface at a desired position .",
    "this enables the construction of atomic magnetic nano - structures and the study of the complex magnetic excitations , resulting from the exchange interaction between the magnetic ions and the substrate , and also between the magnetic atoms themselves .",
    "such a novel fabrication capability has produced a surge of experimental studies on the spin excitations of magnetic nanostructures .",
    "these comprise the investigation of the conductance spectra of individual atomic spins  @xcite , of kondo screened magnetic dimers  @xcite and of multiple chains of mn atoms  @xcite .",
    "interestingly similar investigations have now been extended to molecular chains composed of co - phthalocyanines @xcite .",
    "the recent rapid growth in the experimental activity has been matched by an equally fast explosion of theoretical works .",
    "a general and now standard approach to calculating the conductance spectra of the various possible magnetic nanostructures is that of combining a master equation solver for the quantum transport problem with model hamiltonian describing the magnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "this is an intrinsic many - body approach , which in principle contains all the ingredients needed for solving the problem , once the various transfer rates are known . as such it usually requires a large number of parameters to be predictive .",
    "an alternative strategy consists in treating the problem at the single particle level , by using a tunnel hamiltonian and/or the standard tersoff - hamann description @xcite for the stm current  @xcite .",
    "this second class of computational scheme appears more amenable to be implemented together with first principles electron transport methods .",
    "however it still remains a hybrid theory , where the dynamic part of the problem needs to be approached at the model hamiltonian level , although the level of sophistication may include effects related to current generated non - equilibrium spin populations  @xcite .",
    "a standard theoretical approach to quantum transport is represented by the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism  @xcite , whose mean - field version can be combined with state of the art electronic structure theories to produce efficient and predictive algorithms @xcite .",
    "this is to date the only fully quantitative quantum transport approach capable of scaling to large systems  @xcite , i.e. it is the only one capable of performing simulations for materials set of current technological relevance .",
    "importantly for this discussion inelastic contributions to the elastic current can also be included within the negf formalism . in the case of scattering",
    "to phonons the problem is usually treated perturbatively by constructing an appropriate self - energy at the level of either the first ( 1ba ) or the self - consistent born approximation ( scba )  @xcite",
    ". a similar approach to the case of spin excitations is currently not available .",
    "there are two main reasons for this gap . on the one hand , the adiabatic separation between the electronic degrees of freedom and those responsible for the inelastic excitations are well defined in the case of nuclear motion ( phonons ) but less clear in the case of spins , since even extremely localized spins have full electronic origin @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is also unclear whether the perturbative approach is valid for spins , i.e. whether a suitable expansion parameter can be found . as such , as far as we know , an expression for a self - energy describing inelastic spin - flip events has not been derived so far .    in the present work",
    "we undertake this challenge and formulate a perturbative theory of spin - flip spectroscopy based on the negf formalism for electron transport .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on a tight - binding hamiltonian for the transport electrons , which are locally exchange coupled to quantum spins .",
    "this is essentially the @xmath2-@xmath3 model for magnetism  @xcite .",
    "we then proceed in constructing an appropriate self - energy for the spin - degrees of freedom at the 1ba level ( note that for this particular problem little differences are introduced by extending the treatment to the scba ) and use this in the standard negf scheme for transport .",
    "our methodology is then applied to describing sf - iets in atoms and atomic chains and results are favorably compared with experiments .",
    "the typical experimental setup considered in this work is that of an stm measurement , i.e. it comprises an stm tip positioned above one of the atoms of a magnetic nanostructure , which in turn is weakly coupled to a metallic substrate across an insulating barrier .",
    "we model this system by using a pair of non - interacting semi - infinite leads that are separated by a scattering region as outlined in fig .",
    "the left - hand side lead , the scattering region and the right - hand side lead represent respectively the stm tip , the spin - coupled nanostructure and the substrate and they are described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for simplicity",
    "we assume an identical electronic structure for both the leads ( i.e. they are made of the same material ) , which we describe by a one orbital per site tight - binding hamiltonian with nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "the scattering region consists of a one - dimensional chain of @xmath7 atoms .",
    "each @xmath8th atom carries a quantum mechanical spin @xmath9 and it is characterized by an on - site energy @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the tip and substrate can only couple to one atom at the time in the scattering region and we describe such a coupling by the hopping integrals @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "this means that the electronic states of the scattering region are broadened by the interaction with the electrode by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is hopping parameter in the leads .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 leading to a constant density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the electronic effect of the other atoms in the scattering region ( i.e. creation of bonding and anti - bonding levels ) can be neglected since these levels will also be far enough from the fermi energy to ensure a constant density of states .",
    "the hamiltonian of the scattering region contains three parts @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the tight - binding electronic part , @xmath18 is the spin part and @xmath19 describes the electron - spin interaction .",
    "more explicitly these three components write respectively as @xmath20\\big\\},\\\\ \\label{eq:3 } & { h}_\\mathrm{e - sp}=j_\\mathrm{sd}\\sum_{i\\:\\alpha,\\alpha'}(c_{i\\alpha}^{\\dagger}[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_i]_{{\\alpha}{\\alpha'}}c_{i\\alpha'})\\cdot\\mathbf{s}_i\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the electronic part consists only in an on - site potential , i.e. we neglect electron hopping between the sites [ the electron ladder operators @xmath21 create / annihilate an electron at site @xmath8 with spin @xmath22 ( = @xmath23 ) ] .",
    "we model the spin - spin interaction between the localized spins @xmath24 by a nearest neighbour heisenberg hamiltonian with coupling strength @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore we include interaction with an external magnetic field @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the bohr magneton and @xmath28 the gyromagnetic ratio ) and both uni - axial and transverse anisotropy of magnitude @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively  @xcite .",
    "the electron - spin interaction hamiltonian is constructed within the @xmath2-@xmath3 model  @xcite where the transport electron , @xmath2 , are locally exchanged coupled to quantum spins , @xmath24 ( @xmath3 indicates that the local moments originate from the atomic @xmath3 shell ) . in this case the interaction strength is @xmath31 and in equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) @xmath32 is a vector of pauli matrices .",
    "we now proceed to deriving the perturbation theory in the electron - spin interaction ( note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 independently can be easily diagonalized ) .",
    "our strategy is that of first constructing the many - body green s function at the level of 1ba  @xcite and then , by dyson s equation , to evaluate the interacting self - energy .",
    "in particular we follow closely the procedure laid out in reference  [ ] . since we consider a non - equilibrium situation at zero temperature our starting point is the keldysh  @xcite contour - ordered single - body green s function in the many - body ground state , @xmath35_{\\sigma\\sigma'}=-i{\\langle}|t_c\\{c_{\\sigma}(\\tau)c^{\\dagger}_{\\sigma'}(\\tau')\\}|{\\rangle}\\:,\\ ] ] where the time - average is performed over the full interacting ground state @xmath36 ( note that for clarity we have dropped the site index @xmath8 , which will be explicitly included only where necessary ) . equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be expanded up to the @xmath37-th order in the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath38 , as @xmath39_{\\sigma\\sigma'}=\\sum_n\\frac{(-i)^{n+1}}{n!}\\int\\limits_c{d}\\tau_1\\dots\\int\\limits_c{d}\\tau_n\\ \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & \\frac{{\\langle}0|t_c\\{{h}_\\mathrm{e - sp}(\\tau_1)\\dots{h}_\\mathrm{e - sp}(\\tau_n)c_{k\\sigma}(\\tau)c_{k'\\sigma'}^{\\dagger}(\\tau')\\}|0{\\rangle}}{u(-\\infty,-\\infty)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the time - evolution unitary operator and the time - averages are now over the known non - interacting @xmath41 ground state @xmath42 .",

    "if the expansion is truncated to the first order one obtains a zeeman - like term which can be neglected as long as @xmath47 .",
    "the first contribution of interest then appears at the second order .",

    "the electron bracket has six different time - ordering combinations , which are explicitly listed in the equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) below @xmath54 the last two combinations can be eliminated since they represent unconnected feynman diagrams which vanish in the averaging process  @xcite .",
    "the first and the second term are equal under the exchange of the indexes , and so are the third and the fourth ones .",
    "this leaves us with a simplified expression which , when compared to eq .

    "this is achieved by constructing the full basis @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting eigenvectors , @xmath59 , and eigenvalues , @xmath60 , satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath61 and they can be used to re - write the operators @xmath62 as @xmath63 here @xmath64 is a desctruction operator for a quasi - particle of the spin system .",

    "this usually describes polaronic effects and it is known to cause the breakdown of the born approximation for strong electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "additional quantities of interest , which enter in the definition of the electron current , are the lesser and greater green s functions ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",

    "this is equivalent to replacing the energy in the leads with @xmath121 ( @xmath122 is the electron charge ) .",

    "the entire procedure outlined in the previous two sections is now implemented numerically in order to calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics and the conductance spectra ( @xmath124-@xmath1 ) of some selected magnetic nanostructures .",
    "in particular we aim at reproducing the @xmath124-@xmath1 curve observed through mn monoatomic chains deposited on thin cun insulating atomic layers , as described in reference [ ] .",
    "clearly our 1d model does not include all the details involved in the actual sf - iets stm experiments , but we argue here that it contains already all the ingredients to reproduce the main experimental features .",
    "in table i we list all the parameters used in our simulations and their assigned values .",
    "these have been either inferred from the experiments ( exp )  @xcite or have been estimated from density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the local mn spin is set to be @xmath125 , as proposed in the original experimental works  @xcite , confirmed by dft calculations  @xcite and expected from the nominal mn valence .",
    "the spin - spin coupling parameter @xmath25 corresponds to an antiferromagnetic order between the neighbouring mn spins , a feature verified in the experimental conductance spectra .",
    "the lead on - site energy is suitably set to zero and simply defines the reference potential .",
    "we also note that the value for @xmath31 is determined from theory to be of the order of 500mev  @xcite .",
    "although we employ a zero - temperature formalism we nevertheless evaluate the fermi functions of the leads at the small temperature of 0.6  k. this allows us to include minor thermal smearing of the electron gas in the leads and consequently of the conductance profile .",
    "finally we notice that the scattering region is expected to be significantly more strongly coupled to the substrate than to the tip .",
    "this essentially means that the spin population in the scattering region remains effectively in equilibrium  @xcite with the substrate , i.e. there is no accumulation of spin excitations between two inelastic tunneling events .",
    "figure  [ 3 ] shows the calculated conductance spectra ( normalised against the elastic contribution to the conductance @xmath56 ) for @xmath7-atom long mn chains ( @xmath126 ) in no external magnetic field . in the case of @xmath7=3 and",
    "@xmath7=4 the spectrum is calculated for the stm tip placed above the second atom in the chain . from the figure it is clear that all the qualitative experimental findings are correctly reproduced .",
    "in particular we notice the strong dependence of the conductance profile over the parity of the chains , with chains comprising an odd number of atoms ( odd chains ) exhibiting a conductance dip at around @xmath1=@xmath127 , which is absent for even chains .",
    "the ground state of each odd chain has a net total spin @xmath128 .",
    "this is affected by the transverse and axial anisotropy , which lift the ground state degeneracy and allow a transition between the ground state and the first spin - flip excited state to occur .",
    "the excitation of such a transition results in a conductance step at a voltage corresponding to the transition energy . since the anisotropy energies are small ( see table i ) , the excitation energy is small as well and the feature in the conductance profile appears near @xmath1=0 .",
    "in contrast the even chains do not show any zero - bias excitation , since the ground state is a singlet and does not carry a magnetic moment .",
    "this is a direct proof that the magnetic interaction between mn ions is antiferromagnetic .",
    "should this have been ferromagnetic , even chains would also have shown zero - bias anomalies .    as mentioned above the conductance steps encountered at around @xmath1=0",
    "correspond to spin - flip events , i.e. to electron scattering processes that produce the transition @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is the magnetic quantum number ) but that also preserve the total spin @xmath128 .",
    "the first net spin changing transition occurs for @xmath131 and corresponds to the large conductance step found at @xmath132  mv .",
    "this is investigated in more detail in figure  [ 4 ] , where we also include the dimer s spectrum calculated when a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath53-direction .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field is that of splitting the single excitation line into three distinct conductance steps . in this case in fact the antiferromagnetic dimer has a singlet ( @xmath133=0 ) ground state and a triplet ( @xmath133=1 ) first excited state .",
    "therefore , an excitation from the ground state to the first excited state changes the net spin of the dimer . when a magnetic field is applied the degeneracy of the triplet excited state is lifted and excitations having the three zeeman - splitted levels as final states are possible .",
    "this produces the three - fold splitting of the conductance steps as seen to agree well with experiment in figure  [ 4 ] .",
    "figure  [ 5 ] shows the conductance spectrum for the trimer ( @xmath7=3 ) .",
    "this chain exhibits similar trends as those found for the dimer as a magnetic field is applied , i.e. there is a zeeman split of the zero - field conductance steps . from the figure",
    "one may notice that for both the theoretical ( a ) and experimental ( b ) data there is a shift of the principle step to lower voltages as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "we remark here that in order to recreate the conductance profile of the trimer , additional ferromagnetic second - nearest - neighbour interaction between the local spins at the edge of the chain must be included in the model  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this additional exchange parameter is approximately half of that of @xmath25 .",
    "the inclusion of such a second - nearest - neighbour coupling constant changes the position of the conductance step from a second excited state at 27  mv to a first excited state at 16  mv .",
    "this correction is also included in the calculations for @xmath7=4 ( see fig . [ 3 ] ) , again giving good agreement with experiments .    in all of the spectra investigated the most striking agreement with the experiments",
    "concerns the correct prediction of the sf - iets excitation voltages .",
    "in particular not all the possible spin excitations feature in the @xmath134 curve as a result of spin - selection rules .",
    "a careful analysis of the inelastic process , as outlined in the first section , reveals why some excitations occur and why some other do not .",
    "in particular we note that the proper selection rules for transitions are governed by the prefactor in the self - energy @xmath135 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) ] .",
    "this effectively selects which excitations are more probable to occur .",
    "for example , the full energy spectrum of the trimer has @xmath136 eigenvalues but only a small portion of these eigenvalues will contribute significantly to the scattering self - energy .",
    "consequently only a few transitions will have influence on the conductance spectrum .",
    "this for instance explains why the first conductance step of the dimer is considerably larger than that of other chains of different lengths .",
    "in fact our calculations show that a transition from the singlet ground state ( @xmath137=0 ) to any of the triplet excited states ( @xmath137=1 ; @xmath130= -1 , 0 , + 1 ) has equal probability .",
    "this results in a conductance step which is approximately three times larger than any single spin - flip event that occurs in an odd chain .",
    "in conclusion we have formulated a theory of electron transport through magnetic nanostructures based on the negf formalism and including inelastic spin - scattering .",
    "we have first explicitly derived an expression for the interacting self - energy at the level of the first born approximation in the electron - spin interaction .",
    "this has been used to calculate the current - voltage and the conductance - voltage curves for a 1d system of magnetically coupled spins at finite bias and in a magnetic field .",
    "our results reproduce well the features of recent sf - iets experiments for 1d mn chains .",
    "most notably the severe dependence of the conductance spectra on the chain parity and the selection - rule suppression of certain transitions is a direct outcome of the theory .",
    "our negf approach is therefore a valid alternative to master equation based schemes , with the advantage that it can be scaled up to larger systems and combined with more sophisticated electronic structure theories .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of the spin transport properties of mono - atomic magnetic chains with a focus on the spectroscopical features of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve associated to spin - flip processes . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on the @xmath2-@xmath3 model for magnetism with the electron transport treated at the level of the non - equilibrium green s function formalism . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic spin - flip scattering processes are introduced perturbatively via the first born approximation and an expression for the associated self - energy is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the computational method is then applied to describe the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics and its derivatives of one dimensional chains of mn atoms and the results are then compared to available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we find a qualitative and quantitative agreement between the calculated and the experimental conductance spectra . </S>",
    "<S> significantly we are able to describe the relative intensities of the spin excitation features in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve , by means of a careful analysis of the spin transition selection rules associated to the atomic chains . </S>"
