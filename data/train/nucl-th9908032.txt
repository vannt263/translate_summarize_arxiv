    "the formation of deuterons is the simplest multichannel reaction process in a heavy ion collision . within a systematic quantum statistical approach",
    "the formation is driven by the boltzmann collision integral that in turn requires the proper break - up cross sections .",
    "besides electromagnetic disintegration / formation of the deuteron ( @xmath0 ) that is a generic two - body process , the treatment of three - body collision ( @xmath1 ) is more involved , and requires a solution of the three - body dynamics in medium .",
    "collision rates are a central input into modern microscopic simulations of heavy ion collisions such as the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu )  @xcite or the quantum molecular dynamics approach ( qmd )  @xcite .",
    "for the latest developments and recent applications to multifragmentation in heavy ion collisions see ref .",
    "danielewicz and bertsch  @xcite started the numerical solution of coupled buu equations including the deuteron formation .",
    "later this model has been enlarged to include the production of three - particle clusters  @xcite .",
    "so far these approaches are fed with experimental cross sections , e.g. @xmath2 for the deuteron break - up , and the medium effect is taken into account by the pauli - blocking of final states . however , in principle , as shown earlier those cross sections are changed substantially , when medium effects are consistently included  @xcite .",
    "besides including these medium dependent cross sections in the respective simulations that is currently on its way , it is an interesting and important question to analyze the change of time scales induced by medium dependent reaction cross sections .",
    "the correlated many - particle system is treated within the cluster mean field approach  @xcite that goes beyond the quasiparticle picture and in turn has been applied to a wide variety of many - particle physics problems .",
    "this approach is intimately related to the dyson equation approach to many - body green functions  @xcite .",
    "both approaches lead to a systematic decoupling of the equation hierarchy and thus to effective few - body equations .",
    "for the two - particle case these are known as feynman - galitskii or bethe - goldstone equations .",
    "recently , we have derived a corresponding equation for the three - body system for finite temperatures  @xcite based on the formulation of alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags )  @xcite . for _ zero _ temperatures three - body in - medium equations",

    "@xcite for the related 2p-1h problem .",
    "the respective one- , two- , and three - body equations are derived in an independent particle basis .",
    "that means we do not consider correlations in the surrounding matter that would eventually lead to a self - consistent treatment .",
    "however , such a treatment is technically involved and only very recently progress has been achieved towards this direction by including _",
    "two_-body correlations into the one - body spectral function  @xcite . since presently our aim is different , i.e. to extract the formation and equilibration time scales , and the densities considered are rather low compared to the ones that require a self - consistent treatment , and since many technical problems still need to be tackled we presently do not consider a such an approach for the _ three_-body case .",
    "the life time and the relaxation time are determined by linearizing the boltzmann equation or the corresponding rate equations . therefore the respective integrals can be evaluated in thermal and chemical equilibrium . to this end",
    "we assume only small fluctuations , i.e. linear response of the system .",
