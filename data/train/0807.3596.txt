    "possible new physics beyond the standard model is being intensively searched via the measurements of time - dependent @xmath2 asymmetries in neutral @xmath3 meson decays into final @xmath2 eigenstates defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass difference of the two neutral @xmath3 eigenstates , @xmath6 monitors mixing - induced @xmath2 asymmetry and @xmath7 measures direct @xmath2 violation .",
    "the @xmath2-violating parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10     from @xmath11 penguin decays  @xcite.,width=302 ]    in the standard model @xmath12 for @xmath11 penguin - dominated or pure penguin modes with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for final @xmath2-even ( odd ) states and @xmath15or @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , it is expected in the standard model that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mixing - induced @xmath2 violation in @xmath3 decays has already been observed in the golden mode @xmath19 for several years .",
    "the current world average the mixing - induced asymmetry from tree @xmath20 transition is  @xcite @xmath21 results of the time - dependent _ cp_-asymmetries in the @xmath22 induced two - body decays such as @xmath23 are shown in fig .  1 and 2  @xcite .",
    "in the sm , cp asymmetry in all above - mentioned modes should be equal to @xmath24 with a small deviation _ at most _",
    "@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this may originate from the @xmath26 truncation and from the subdominant ( color - suppressed ) tree contribution to these processes .",
    "since the penguin loop contributions are sensitive to high virtuality , new physics beyond the sm may contribute to @xmath8 through the heavy particles in the loops . in order to detect the signal of new physics unambiguously in the penguin @xmath11 modes , it is of great importance to examine how much of the deviation of @xmath6 from @xmath24 , @xmath27 is allowed in the sm  @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath7 from @xmath11 penguin decays  @xcite.,width=302 ]    the decay amplitude for the pure penguin or penguin - dominated charmless @xmath3 decay in general has the form @xmath28 unitarity of the ckm matrix elements leads to @xmath29 where we use @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the first term in the above expression is suppressed by a factor of @xmath33 relative to the second term . for a pure penguin decay such as @xmath34",
    ", it is naively expected that @xmath35 is in general comparable to @xmath36 in magnitude .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation we have @xmath37 . for penguin - dominated modes , such as @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath35 also receives tree contributions from the @xmath39 tree operators . since the wilson coefficient for the penguin operator is smaller than the one for the tree operator , it is possible that @xmath35 is larger than @xmath36 .",
    "as the @xmath40 term carries a weak phase @xmath41 , @xmath6 may be subjected to a significant  tree pollution \" .    to quantify the deviation ,",
    "it is known that  @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 and only terms up to the first order in @xmath45 are shown .",
    "hence , the magnitude of the @xmath2 asymmetry difference @xmath46 and direct @xmath2 violation are both governed by the size of @xmath47 . for the aforementioned penguin - dominated modes ,",
    "the tree contribution is color suppressed and , hence , in practice , the deviation of @xmath8 is expected to be small  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath48 is proportional to the real part of @xmath49 as shown in the above equation .",
    "below i will briefly review the results of the sm expectations on @xmath48 from the su(3@xmath50 approach , short - distance and long - distance calculations .",
    "i briefly review the underlying reasoning of the su(3@xmath50 approach ( using @xcite as an example ) and summarize the present results .",
    "recent reviews of results obtained from the su(3@xmath50 approach can be found in  @xcite .    for a @xmath52 decay , such as @xmath53 decay ,",
    "the decay amplitude is given by @xmath54 note that comparing with the @xmath55 amplitude , we have @xmath56 replaced by @xmath57 in the ckm matrices , resulting an opposite hierarchy of tree and penguin amplitudes .",
    "hence , ratio of ( tree dominated ) @xmath52 and ( penguin dominated ) @xmath55 amplitudes may provide information on @xmath45 .    through su(3@xmath50 symmetry , one can obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 are some su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "consequently , a suitable sum of @xmath53 amplitudes gives @xmath60 which is identical to @xmath61 , except with @xmath62 replaced by @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 is not a @xmath55 decay amplitude , but a sum of several @xmath52 amplitudes .",
    "the absolute value of the ratio of @xmath65 and @xmath61 with a suitable ckm factor , gives @xmath66 which can be used to constrain @xmath45 .",
    "there are two comments : ( i ) from the above expression , we see that the bound on @xmath45 can not be better than @xmath67 .",
    "( ii ) if no assumption on phases of @xmath53 amplitudes is made , the above ratio is bounded by @xmath68 which is , however , a rather conservative bound .",
    "the bounds work better for modes with less ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53 modes involved in the sum .",
    "present results on the bounds are briefly summarized , while more detail discussions can be found in recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "bounds on various @xmath69 are found to be : @xmath70  @xcite , @xmath71 and @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "other results on @xmath73 and @xmath74 modes can be found in @xcite .",
    "these bounds can be improved by measuring relevant @xmath52 modes as much as possible .",
    "for example , measurements of @xmath75 and @xmath76 rates can improve the @xmath77 bound ( see @xcite for recent update on the data ) .",
    "there are several qcd - based approaches in calculating hadronic @xmath3 decays  @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 from calculations of qcdf  @xcite , pqcd  @xcite , scet  @xcite are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the qcdf calculations on @xmath78 , @xmath79 modes are from @xcite  , while those in @xmath80 modes are from @xcite .",
    "the scet calculations on @xmath78 modes are from  @xcite , while those on @xmath79 modes are from  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that ( i )  @xmath48 are predicted to be small and positive in most cases , while experimental central values for @xmath48 are all negative , except the one from @xmath81 ; ( ii )  in most cases , qcdf and pqcd results agree with each other , since the main difference of these two approach is the ( penguin ) annihilation contribution , which hardly affects @xmath6 ; ( iii )  the scet results involve some non - perturbative contributions fitted from data .",
    "these contributions affect @xmath82 . in some modes results different from other short distance calculations",
    "are obtained .",
    ".@xmath48 from various short - distance calculations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      decay.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   decay.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    it was realized recently that long distance fsi may play indispensable role in @xmath3 decays  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of final - state interactions in bringing in possible tree pollution sources to @xmath8 are considered in  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 will receive long - distance tree and penguin contributions from rescattering of some intermediate states .",
    "in particular , there may be some dynamical enhancement on light @xmath83-quark loop .",
    "if tree contributions to @xmath84 are sizable , then final - state rescattering will have the potential of pushing @xmath6 away from the naive expectation .",
    "take the penguin - dominated decay @xmath85 as an illustration .",
    "it can proceed through the weak decay @xmath86 followed by the rescattering @xmath87 .",
    "the tree contribution to @xmath86 , which is color allowed , turns out to be comparable to the penguin one because of the absence of the chiral enhancement characterized by the @xmath88 penguin term .",
    "consequently , even within the framework of the sm , final - state rescattering may provide a mechanism of tree pollution to @xmath8 . by the same token",
    ", we note that although @xmath89 is a pure penguin process at short distances , it does receive tree contributions via long - distance rescattering .",
    "note that in addition to these charmless final states contributions , there are also contributions from charmful @xmath90 final states , see fig .  3 .",
    "these final - state rescatterings provide the long - distance @xmath83- and @xmath91-penguin contributions .",
    "an updated version  @xcite of results in @xcite are shown in table  iii .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "( i ) @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the theoretical and experimental cleanest modes for measuring @xmath0 in these penguin modes .",
    "the constructive interference behavior of penguins in the @xmath94 mode is still hold in the ld case , resulting a tiny @xmath95 .",
    "( ii ) tree pollutions in @xmath96 and @xmath97 are diluted due to the ld @xmath91-penguin contributions .",
    "( iii ) in general , in this approach , the main contributions to decay amplitudes are charming - penguin like and do not sizably affect @xmath8 .",
    "recent measurements on @xmath98 direct cp violations show a more than 5  @xmath99 deviation ( known as the @xmath98 puzzle ) between @xmath100 and @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "the data indicates the needs of other sub - leading contributions , such as long distance fsi and charming penguins and so on ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that in cases where the @xmath98 direct cp data are reproduced , these sub - leading contributions do not sizably affect the magnitudes of @xmath102  @xcite , but some of the signs are different from the short - distance expectations  @xcite .",
    "various theoretical approaches and results on @xmath48 are briefly reviewed .",
    "considerable progress has been made . from these results",
    "we see that the prediction on signs of @xmath46 are more or less fluctuating and may be subjected to change when more hadronic contributions are taken into account , on the contrary , the predictions on the sizes of @xmath48 should be more robust . since the predictions on sizes of @xmath46 , which are not sizable in most cases , have better agreement among various approaches . at the same time for modes with small @xmath48 ( @xmath103 ) , we do not expect sizable direct @xmath2 violations .",
    "measurements on direct @xmath2 violations , some @xmath52 rates and three - body rates and spectra can provide useful information that can be used to improve our theoretical predictions on @xmath48 . to further improve the theoretical accuracy more works",
    "are needed to effectively reduce the hadronic uncertainties .",
