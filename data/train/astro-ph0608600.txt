    "the inspiral and merger of binary black holes systems is one of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves that both earth - based interferometric antennas ( ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo600  @xcite and tama  @xcite ) and space - based ones ( lisa  @xcite ) will detect .",
    "these waves carry both energy and momentum away from the system , leading to the adiabatic shrinking of the orbit , due to the former , and a recoil of the merged object by conservation of momentum , due to the latter .",
    "the magnitude of this recoil is of astrophysical importance because it determines whether the merged hole will be ejected from its host galaxy .",
    "possible observational evidence for such a recoil may be the observations of faint galaxies  @xcite where the lack of a dense nucleus has been associated with the central black hole being ejected after merger  @xcite . there is also evidence of an ejection of a supermassive black hole in ongoing galaxy mergers , either because of recoil or because of slingshot due to the presence of 3 or more supermassive black holes in the merger  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational recoil has also been shown to have important consequences in hierarchical merging scenarios and the observable structure of galaxy nuclei .",
    "recoil velocities of a few hundred km / s could be large when compared to escape velocities of dwarf galaxies , globular clusters and dark matter halos  @xcite . for super - massive black holes at the centers of galaxies , a kick of this magnitude could potentially transfer energy to the stars in the nucleus",
    "there are thus very important astrophysical aspects that can be refined or clarified with a better understanding of the black hole kicking process .",
    "mass distributions without symmetries that undergo gravitational collapse of any sort will exhibit momentum ejection and recoil of the center of mass of the remnant due to the strong emission of gravitational radiation  @xcite . of particular interest is the case of unequal - mass black - hole binary systems .",
    "an intuitive picture of how the system gets a _ kick _",
    "after the merger is the following  @xcite : from the _ center of mass _ point of view , the lighter black hole will move faster than the heavier one , and hence it will beam forward gravitational radiation stronger . then , there will be a net flux of linear momentum carried by the gravitational radiation in the direction of the lighter black hole , and this will cause a recoil of the _ center of mass _ in the opposite direction .",
    "the first analytic studies of this subject were carried out by fitchett and detweiler  @xcite ; oohara and nakamura  @xcite ; nakamura and haugan  @xcite ; and wiseman  @xcite . due to the strong non - linearity of the merger phase ,",
    "analytic studies have difficulties in obtaining an accurate estimate of the recoil velocity .",
    "the first quasi - newtonian analytic calculations were presented in  @xcite , while a post - newtonian ( pn ) analysis have been carried out in  @xcite .",
    "estimates using black - hole perturbation theory have been given in  @xcite , and a estimate that combines full numerical relativity and perturbation theory , the _ lazarus _ approach , is given in  @xcite .",
    "full numerical relativistic simulations are a natural approach to this problem since they can in principle handle the non - linearities of the gravitational field during the merger .",
    "the challenge is the resolution that the computational resources impose .",
    "some calculations have already been carried out in different scenarios to estimate recoil velocities .",
    "the first one was done by anninos and brandt  @xcite for the case of the head - on collision of two unequal - mass black holes .",
    "their numerical calculations were effectively 2-dimensional since they made use of the axisymmetry of the configuration .",
    "using the same type of numerical calculations they also estimated the gravitational radiation recoil from highly distorted black holes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , and due to the significant advances in 3-dimensional numerical relativity in the binary black hole problem  @xcite , estimates of the radiation recoil velocity have also appeared  @xcite .",
    "each of the approaches described above has its own limitations .",
    "analytic approaches are able to provide accurate estimates in their region of validity . however , the largest contribution to the recoil velocity occurs during merger , precisely where the approximation methods break down .",
    "numerical simulations , in principle , have the opportunity of producing estimates with a minimal number of assumptions",
    ". however , as we have mentioned , these calculations have also limitations and use initial data that is only an approximation to the actual astrophysical configurations .",
    "therefore , the error bars on the computed distribution of recoil velocities relative to the distribution present in nature are believed to be large and , even worse , are difficult to estimate .",
    "it is then not surprising to find disagreements on the estimated recoil velocity as calculated with different methods .    in this paper",
    ", we present estimates of the recoil velocity using an approach not used before , the close - limit approximation ( cla ) , which combines both analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "the cla was introduced by price and pullin  @xcite , who showed that this approximation method provides accurate results compared to those obtained from numerical relativity  @xcite for head - on collisions of two black holes ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the cla scheme is based on the assumption that in the last stage of coalescence , when the black holes are sufficiently _ close _ to each other , the system behaves , up to a certain degree of approximation , as a single distorted hole .",
    "then , the cla scheme consists of establishing an appropriate correspondence between the binary black hole system and a single perturbed hole .",
    "once this correspondence is made , one can extract initial data that can be evolved by the perturbative relativistic equations . from the outcome of the evolution",
    ", one can estimate the fluxes of energy , angular momentum , and linear momentum carried away to spatial infinity by the gravitational radiation emitted .",
    "the cla scheme has been developed and applied by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , andrade and price  @xcite used the cla to estimate the recoil velocity of a head - on collision of unequal - mass black holes starting from rest .",
    "since the cla applies to the last stage of the merger of two black holes , it is very appealing to use it to estimate the recoil velocity of the merger of an unequal - mass black hole binary system . with this scheme ,",
    "we obtain a maximum recoil velocity of @xmath6 km / s for a symmetric mass ratio @xmath7 and initial proper separations of @xmath8 , with @xmath3 the total adm mass . beyond a proper separation of @xmath2 the cla",
    "is not expected to provide accurate results  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this method can not account for the contributions during the inspiral and initial merger phase . supplementing this estimate with pn calculations up to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ,",
    "we obtain a lower bound for the recoil velocity , with a maximum of @xmath9 km / s .",
    "this lower bound neglects the initial merger phase , for which we can obtain an approximate estimate by using either pn methods or the cla . since both methods are known to overestimate the amount of radiation during the early merger phase , we obtain , thus , an upper limit for the recoil with maxima in the range of @xmath10 km / s .",
    "we also perform non - linear fits to these bounds and obtain @xmath11 where @xmath12 km / s , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the lower bound and @xmath15 km / s , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the upper bound .",

    "the conventions that we use throughout this work are the following : for the 4-dimensional spacetime , we use greek letters for the indices and a semicolon for the covariant derivative .",

    "we also use physical units in which @xmath27 .",
    "in this paper , we use the cla scheme to calculate the recoil velocities after the merger of an unequal - mass binary black hole system . due to the complexity of the calculation",
    ", we discuss here the different steps involved , while getting a glimpse of the general scheme .",
    "first , we need to construct initial data corresponding to a non - spinning binary black hole system in quasicircular orbital motion .",
    "the method employed to construct the data is the standard one : we solve the constraints on an initial slice using the york - lichnerowicz conformal decomposition .",
    "then , the solution needs to be expanded in two parameters : the separation of the two black holes , based on the main assumption of the cla , that is , small separation between the holes ; and their linear momenta , rooted in an additional _ slow motion _",
    "approximation  @xcite .",
    "the second step is to establish a map between this initial data and the generic initial data corresponding to a perturbed single black hole . in this work",
    "we only consider the case in which the single black hole is a non - rotating schwarzschild hole .",
    "there is also the possibility of considering a kerr black hole ( see  @xcite for details ) , but the cla machinery in that case is more intricate . after expanding the initial data in the separation and linear momenta ,",
    "it is straightforward , after some coordinate changes , to identify a schwarzschild background and its perturbations .",
    "once the perturbations have been identified , we need to calculate initial data suitable for evolving the linearized ( around the schwarzschild background ) einstein equations .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the background allows us to separate the linearized equations .",
    "then , by decomposing the perturbations in spherical harmonics we obtain decoupled equations for each mode .",
    "moreover , by appropriately reparameterizing the perturbations , we can decouple the equations for each individual mode , so that the problem reduces to solving a master equation for a complex combination of the metric perturbations .",
    "these master equations ( usually known as the regge - wheeler and zerilli - moncrief equations ) are 1-dimensional wave - type equations containing a potential that accounts for the effect of the background spacetime curvature .",
    "therefore , the problem of providing initial data reduces to finding initial conditions for these master functions .",
    "the initial data contains three parameters that we need to specify .",
    "these parameters are associated with the initial distance between the holes , the mass ratio , and the initial linear momentum .",
    "the mass ratio is an independent parameter that will be used to study the functional behavior of the recoil velocity .",
    "the distance and linear momentum parameters determine the dynamical character of the binary and , therefore , they must be chosen carefully . to that end",
    ", we use the standard method of minimizing the binding energy of the system , so that the binary is in a quasi - circular orbit .",
    "the expressions that we obtain are formally the same as in newtonian theory , although they can not be assigned the same interpretation , since they are expressed in terms of _ bare _ parameters . in order to relate these parameters to meaningful physical ones , we must introduce a proper separation and a physical mass ratio",
    ". the proper separation can be calculated by evaluating the minimum proper distance between the marginally trapped surfaces surrounding each individual hole .",
    "the final step is to solve the master equations and evaluate the different physical quantities of interest .",
    "the metric waveforms @xmath28 and @xmath29 , together with the fluxes of energy , angular and linear momentum carried away by gravitational waves can be computed in terms of the master functions and their first time derivatives . in this paper",
    ", we include the general formulae for the linear momentum fluxes in terms of the perturbation master functions .",
    "we present several plots of these quantities , together with plots of the recoil velocities for different initial separations .",
    "in this section , we begin the initial data construction for an unequal - mass binary black hole system suitable to the cla scheme . to that end",
    ", we extend the results of andrade and price  @xcite , who carried out the calculation for unboosted head - on collisions , and also extend the results of khanna _ et al _",
    "@xcite , who constructed data for equal - mass black holes in a quasicircular orbit .",
    "our calculation not only allows for arbitrary mass ratios , but it also includes higher - order terms in the expansion of the initial data , which are essential in the calculation of the recoil .    in order to solve the hamiltonian and momentum constraints , we use the conformal transverse - traceless method of lichnerowicz , york and others  @xcite .",
    "the 3-metric @xmath30 is decomposed in terms of a conformal factor @xmath31 and an auxiliary metric @xmath32 , @xmath33 which here we assume to be conformally flat : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the line element of the @xmath36-sphere . for the extrinsic curvature @xmath37 we choose a _",
    "maximal _ initial slice , that is , @xmath38 is trace free : @xmath39 .",
    "then , we also conformally decompose the trace - free extrinsic curvature @xmath38 as @xmath40 and we further make the choice that the longitudinal part of @xmath41 vanishes , so that @xmath41 is a symmetric transverse traceless tensor .",
    "then , the momentum and hamiltonian constraints reduce to @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the covariant derivative and laplacian associated with the flat 3-metric @xmath46 the momentum constraint [ eq .  ( [ momentumc ] ) ] can be exactly solved using the method of bowen and york  @xcite . for a single black hole located at @xmath47 with linear momentum @xmath48",

    "moreover , @xmath63 is also a vector that points from hole @xmath61 to @xmath36 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the linear momenta associated with holes 1 and 2 respectively . since the linear momenta are parallel to the @xmath66-axis , the orbital angular momentum is directed along the @xmath67-axis .",

    "the adm momentum corresponding to @xmath70 is simply @xmath48 and the one associated with @xmath41 is zero .",
    "let us now concentrate on the solution to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ cextrinsic ] ) in the hamiltonian constraint leads to a source term quadratic in @xmath71 .",
    "we now introduce a _ slow - motion _ approximation , where we assume that the linear momentum @xmath71 is _ small _ , in the sense that terms of @xmath72 are much smaller than terms of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a measure of the orbital velocity .",
    "we , thus , neglect terms of @xmath75 , so that the hamiltonian constraint reduces to the laplace equation @xmath76 the solution of this equation depends on our choice of topology .",
    "if we choose the initial slice to have a single asymptotically flat region , the solution to the conformal factor is the misner solution  @xcite , but if one chooses the slice to have three asymptotically - flat regions , the solution is the brill - lindquist  @xcite one . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the latter and the conformal factor takes the form of the newtonian potential : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the _ bare _ masses of each individual hole .",
    "one reason for choosing the brill - lindquist ( bl ) solution is that it is simpler to manipulate , while it has also been shown  @xcite to lead to essentially the same results when calculating recoil velocities for head - on collisions .",
    "we remark that , although terms of @xmath75 have been neglected , they can be straightforwardly added in a perturbative fashion , but this will be studied elsewhere .",
    "let us comment further on the topology of the initial slice associated with the bl solution , as it is important in some calculations .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this solution has three asymptotically - flat regions : one of them , @xmath80 , corresponds to the region far from the two holes , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ; the other two , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are associated with hole @xmath61 and @xmath36 respectively . by simple inspection of the conformal factor [ eq .  ( [ cfactor ] ) ] , the solution seems ill - behaved at the location of the holes , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , although it is actually not .",
    "near each hole , the geometry is invariant under the transformation : @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the value @xmath89 coincides with the intersection of the event horizon with the initial slice for a single hole and it is a fixed point in the transformation .",
    "this value is sometimes referred to as the _ throat _ , joining two asymptotically - flat regions .",
    "therefore , the points @xmath90 and @xmath91 are just an _ image _ of the infinities of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for a single hole ,",
    "there are two asymptotically - flat regions , and its mass , equal to @xmath92 , is the same independent of which region we evaluate it on . in the case of a binary system ,",
    "the gravitational interaction between the holes will change the value of the individual masses . actually , there is not an invariant measure of them in @xmath80 , but such a measure does exist on @xmath83 and @xmath84 . doing the calculation yields the following result  @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 in @xmath80 , we can compute the total mass of the binary system , the adm mass of the system .",
    "we call the result @xmath3 and it is given by @xmath95 eqs .",
    "( [ cextrinsic ] ) , ( [ cfactor ] ) , and  ( [ pextrinsic ] ) are the initial data .",
    "we should note that , apart from our choice of initial data ( bl conformal factor and bowen - york extrinsic curvature ) , there are other possible choices that can be used in the cla scheme .",
    "some examples of other possible data sets are the following : a misner conformal factor with a bowen - york extrinsic curvature with inversion symmetry through the throats ; kerr - schild initial data  @xcite .",
    "the next step in the construction of the initial data is to put it in a form suitable for the cla scheme . before doing so , however , it is convenient to study the parameters that determine the configuration described by the data . to begin with ,",
    "let us introduce the _ bare _ mass ratio @xmath96 the initial configuration can then be fully specified in terms of the parameters @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 and @xmath57 are _ bare _ parameters , in the sense that we can not give them a physical meaning , we are going to introduce analogous parameters , which can be given a physical interpretation .",
    "first , we introduce the mass ratio between the individual masses of the holes as computed in their respective asymptotically - flat regions : @xmath99 the quantities @xmath98 and @xmath100 are related through @xmath57 via  @xcite : @xmath101(m / d)}{1 + [ ( 1+q)q/2](m / d ) } \\ , , \\label{mass - ratio1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath102 ^ 2}\\ , .",

    ", we use the same distance as andrade and price  @xcite , which is the proper distance between the points where the marginally trapped surfaces , surrounding each individual hole , cross the @xmath56-axis ( we obviously refer to crossing points closer to the opposite hole ) . when the initial configuration does not present a common apparent horizon , these marginally trapped surfaces are the individual components of the apparent horizon . if @xmath103 and @xmath104 stand for these crossing points , the distance we have just defined is given by @xmath105 which yields    @xmath106    where @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) are the @xmath112-coordinate locations of holes 1 and 2 respectively in the conformal space . in summary , we can determine our initial configuration either by specifying the set @xmath97 or the set @xmath113    the cla scheme assumes that the black holes are sufficiently close enough , which allows us to expand the initial data in @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in this sense , it is useful to choose the coordinate origin , @xmath116 in such a way that it coincides with the _ bare _ center of mass of the binary black hole , that is : @xmath117 we can write then @xmath118 and @xmath119 in terms of the separation vector @xmath120 via @xmath121 where we have defined @xmath122 then , it is natural to expand the initial data in the following dimensionless parameter @xmath123 @xmath124 a key formula for performing these expansions is the following : @xmath125 where we have introduced the following unit vectors @xmath126 and where @xmath127 denote the gegenbauer polynomials .",

    "the transformation from isotropic coordinates to schwarzschild coordinates is given by the following relations : @xmath158 applying this transformation to the 3-metric of our initial data we obtain : @xmath159 where @xmath160 in order to construct initial data for the perturbations , evolve it , and compute from the result all the relevant physical information , in the next subsections we give a summary of ( non - rotating ) black - hole perturbation theory and the main tools needed for the application of the cla scheme .",

    "[ other - calc ] we observe that there seem to be three groups of results : one that clusters around the @xmath36 pn taylor expanded result ; another that is close to the @xmath36 pn effective - one - body result ; and a third one that is in between the first two .",
    "this disagreement , however , is misleading in several ways .",
    "first , some estimates of the recoil velocity quote no error bars , as is the case of the first perturbation theory approach  @xcite and the @xmath36 pn effective - one - body approach  @xcite .",
    "second , the error bars that do exist in other calculation are only estimates and could very well have been underestimated .",
    "a surprising disagreement is between the pn approaches , since when used to calculate other quantities , such as the angular frequency at the isco , they do agree .",
    "this disagreement seems to be rooted in the fact that the greatest contribution to the recoil velocity comes from the merger part of the inspiral , where neither extension of the pn approach is guaranteed to be accurate .",
    "our estimates seem to agree with most results if one accounts for error bars . the results of refs .",
    "@xcite ( squares , triangles and circles in the figure ) seem to overestimate the recoil , which is expected in the case of the extreme - mass ratio approximation .",
    "the pn results of refs .",
    "@xcite seem to overestimate and underestimate the recoil respectively , but they are consistent with our bounds if one takes their error bars ( not shown in the figure ) into account .",
    "the full numerical relativity results seem to overlap with our bounds , although there are only a few of them .",
    "we should note that our bound seems to disagree with the full numerical relativistic result for @xmath409 , but that result seems to be an underestimate because of the small initial separation  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the recoil velocity after the merger of an unequal mass binary black hole system using the cla scheme .",
    "this approximation assumes that the black holes are close enough that the system can be approximated by a single perturbed black hole spacetime .",
    "in contrast to other approaches , except for full numerical relativity , this approximation allows us to make valid statement about physical process when the system is close to plunge .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to use this method for the study of gravitational recoil .",
    "however , the cla has the disadvantage that it can not be used during the beginning of the merger or the inspiral phases .",
    "initial data for the cla can be constructed analytically by mapping data suitable for a binary black hole inspiral to that of a single perturbed hole . with such initial data , the cunningham - price - moncrief and the zerilli - moncrief master functions can be numerically evolved from some initial proper separation through ringdown .",
    "these gauge - invariant master functions contain all the information necessary to evaluate the gravitational metric waveforms and , thus , the energy , angular momentum and linear momentum fluxes carried away from the system .",
    "the results obtained can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the maximum recoil velocity obtained in the cla scheme is of @xmath410 km / s for the maximum initial separation allowed by this method ( @xmath411 ) .",
    "this maximum occurs at a symmetric mass ratio of @xmath348 . by supplementing this estimate with pn ones valid in the inspiral regime ,",
    "we obtain lower and upper bounds with maxima of @xmath412 km / s and @xmath413 km / s respectively .",
    "we have further provided non - linear analytic fit functions that conveniently parameterize these bounds , together with the results from the cla , and other results in the literature .",
    "these results also suggest that there is a region around @xmath414 that greatly contributes to the recoil , but can only be poorly modelled by current approximation schemes .",
    "ultimately , the estimates presented here suffer of the same predicaments as other calculations .",
    "due to its analytical nature , the cla relies on certain assumptions that do not hold over the entire history of the binary .",
    "such assumptions introduce an error in the estimated recoil that is difficult to quantify .",
    "in particular , the assumptions made here are the following : close separations ; slow - motion ; simple initial data .",
    "the close - limit assumption is essential to allow a mapping of a binary inspiral to a single perturbed spacetime .",
    "the slow - motion approximation supplements the close - limit assumption and can , in principle , be improved on in future extensions of this work .",
    "the choice of initial data is assumed to represent the gravitational content of some initial slice , although we know that this fails even at large separation because it does not agree with the deviations from conformal flatness predicted by pn theory .",
    "moreover , it does not contain any radiation , which is not what it should be expected for initial data corresponding to a snapshot of the orbital evolution .",
    "due to these assumptions , the estimate of the recoil velocity will be contaminated by some error .",
    "however , experience in cla calculations indicates that the error made only overestimates the physical quantities calculated , relative to full numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "future work will concentrate on extending this approach to second order in @xmath71 and to other , more realistic , initial data sets  @xcite . ultimately , it would be interesting to compare the cla approach directly to full numerical relativistic simulations in an attempt to determine the region of validity of the cla more accurately .",
    "another possibility is to use a multi - parameter perturbation scheme ( see  @xcite ) where perturbations in the linear momentum and separation parameters can be cleanly separated at the different perturbative orders .",
