    "since the unambiguous identification of the first cool brown dwarf ( bd ) gl 229b ( oppenheimer et al . 1995 ) , the discovery of objects with temperatures cooler than the latest known m - dwarfs has been steadily increasing .",

    "several of these",

    "1999 ) , sdss ( strauss et al . 1999 ) and the vlt ( cuby et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the ir spectrum of these objects is characterized by the unambiguous signature of methane absorption in the h , k and l bands , the predicted dominant equilibrium form of carbon below a local temperature @xmath12 k in the @xmath13 bar range ( allard & hauschildt 1995 ; tsuji et al .",

    "the abundance of a condensed species is obtained by the condition that this species be in equilibrium with the surrounding gas phase , @xmath28 ( grossman , 1972 ) .",
    "the opacities of the grains are calculated from mie theory ( see also alexander & ferguson , 1994 ) .",
    "the formation of condensed species depletes the gas phase of a number of molecular species ( e.g. vo , tio , feh , cah , mgh ) and of refractory elements such as al , ca , ti , fe , v ( fegley & lodders , 1996 ; allard 1998 ; lodders 1999 ; burrows & sharp , 1999 ) , modifying significantly the atmospheric structure and the emergent spectrum . for late m - dwarfs and for massive and/or young bds ,",
    "the main cloud formation is predicted to occur near the photosphere ( see e.g. allard 1998 ; lodders 1999 ) .",
    "the present calculations assume a grain - size distribution in the submicron range ( allard et al 2000a ) .",
    "this general grain treatment is consistent with the observations of the objects near the bottom of and below the ms , namely the denis and 2mass objects ( delfosse et al . 1999 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999b ) , gd 165b ( kirkpatrick et al",
    ". 1999a ) and kelu-1 ( ruiz et al .",
    "1997 ) , which all exhibit strong thermal heating and very red colors .",
    "asides from this complex thermochemistry , grain formation is in fact a dynamical process and involves a balance between various timescales , such as the condensation , evaporation , coagulation , coalescence and convection timescales ( see e.g. rossow 1978 ) , not mentioning the fact that non - equilibrium species might be present , as for example in the atmosphere of jupiter ( fegley & lodders 1994 ) . since such dynamical processes are not incorporated in the theory at the present stage , we elected to conduct calculations under various extreme assumptions .",
    "the first set of models are based on the dust - free `` nextgen '' model atmospheres ( allard et al . 1996 ; hab99 ) and are the same as in bcah98 . in the second set of models , _ all _ condensed equilibrium species are included both in the eos and in the opacity , taking into account dust scattering and absorption in the radiative transfer equation .",
    "these models are referred to as `` dusty '' models .",
    "the third set of models includes the formation of grains in the atmosphere eos , thus taking into account the photospheric depletion of dust - forming elements in the gas phase , but not in the transfer equation , therefore ignoring the opacity of these condensates .",
    "this case , referred to as `` cond '' models , mimics a rapid gravitational settling of all grains below the photosphere .",
    "this is similar to the burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) calculations below @xmath29 k ( see above ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", the dusty and cond models represent extreme situations which bracket the more likely intermediate case resulting from complex , and presently not understood , thermochemical and dynamical processes .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays @xmath30-@xmath31 atmosphere profiles for @xmath32 = 1800 k , log @xmath33=5 and solar composition , under the afore - mentioned different assumptions for the dust treatment .",
    "the atmospheric heating due to the large grain opacity ( the so - called greenhouse or backwarming effect ) in the dusty model is clearly visible , and yields a significantly hotter structure .",
    "the effect is dominant in the outer layers , where the spectrum forms , and decreases in the inner layers , where the connection with the interior profile occurs ( see also tsuji et al .",
    "1996 ) . when dust opacity is not taken into account as in the cond models , the inner atmospheric structure is barely affected by the formation of dust and",
    "is similar to the dust - free case ( nextgen ) for this temperature . only for significantly cooler @xmath32",
    "does dust formation start to affect substantially the inner structure compared to dust - free models .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig1 ] , convection occurs only in optically - thick regions ( @xmath34 ) , in contrast to hotter objects ( see bcah98 ) .",
    "however , this optical depth corresponds to only about one pressure scale height @xmath35 , or even less , from the photosphere ( @xmath36 ) near which occurs the condensation temperature of most grains for objects near the bottom of the ms .",
    "even for the cooler models ( @xmath37 k ) where convection retreats to deeper layers , the top of the convective zone lies only at a few @xmath35 from the photosphere .",
    "this can have important consequences on the formation and settling of atmospheric grains .",
    "indeed , turbulent diffusion , as produced for example by overshooting from the convection zone or by advection due to rotation , is a much more efficient mechanism than microscopic diffusion and sedimentation , at least for submicron - size particles .",
    "although the temperature at the top of the convective zone is found to be generally above the condensation temperature of all grains , this turbulent diffusion will efficiently bring material upward to the region of condensation and maintain small - grain layers , which otherwise would have settled gravitationally , in this region .",
    "note that for submicron - size species , the condensation time @xmath38 is much smaller than other dynamical timescales ( see e.g. rossow , 1978 ; lunine et al .",
    "1989 ) . as temperature decreases , the photospheric density increases , more species",
    "condense so that the particle density @xmath39 increases .",
    "coalescence will become effective in growing large particles ( @xmath40 , rossow 1978 ) and the afore - mentioned turbulent mixing could no longer prevent these large particles to fall out rapidly . moreover the condensation line of some species ( e.g. silicates ) will drop below the photosphere ( see e.g. lodders 1999 ) . within this general scheme ,",
    "the dusty models correspond to a situation with very efficient turbulent mixing , whereas the cond models correspond to a situation where mixing is inefficient compared with sedimentation .",
    "whether this general mechanism , and the related decrease of opacity , can explain the color saturation - and thus smaller backwarming - of the coolest l - dwarfs remains to be quantified correctly .",
    "work in this direction is under progress .    as anticipated from figure [ fig1 ] , spectral and photometric properties",
    "are generally more affected by dust formation than the inner atmospheric structure and thus the evolution , as shown in the next section .",
    "this reflects the weak dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath32 upon opacity for bds , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( burrows & liebert , 1993 ) .    * * * figure 1 * * *      evolutionary calculations have been performed for @xmath44 k , which corresponds to masses between 0.1 @xmath45 and 0.01 @xmath45 for ages @xmath46 yr , following the method described in cb97 .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of @xmath32 as a function of time for various masses and dust treatments .",
    "this illustrates the uncertainty expected from dust treatment on the cooling of bds . for a given age ,",
    "the differences between the two extreme dusty and cond models reach up to @xmath4710% in @xmath32 and @xmath4725% in luminosity @xmath41 .",
    "the hydrogen - burning minimum mass ( hbmm ) is only moderately affected by dust formation .",
    "the opacity due to the formation of different grains ( e.g. silicates , al@xmath48o@xmath49 , catio@xmath49 ) produces a blanketing effect which lowers the effective temperature and luminosity for a given mass at the bottom of the main sequence , as noted initially by lunine et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "models omitting grain opacity ( nextgen and cond ) yield @xmath50 0.072 @xmath45 , @xmath32=1700k , @xmath51 , whereas dusty models yield a slightly lower limit , @xmath50 0.07 @xmath45 , @xmath32=1550 k , @xmath52 , for solar composition .",
    "a lower luminosity requires a smaller h - burning nuclear energy in the core to reach thermal equilibrium , thus a lower central temperature and therefore a lower mass , which yields a lower hbmm .",
    "* * * figure 2 * * *    the present calculations incorporate new conductive opacities by potekhin et al . (",
    "1999 ) in the interior .",
    "these opacities , initially developed for neutron star envelopes and white dwarf cores , improve previous calculations ( hubbard and lampe , 1969 ; itoh et al .",
    "1983 and mitake et al . , 1984 ; brassard and fontaine , 1994 ) and cover the range of temperatures and densities characteristic of bd interiors .",
    "an interesting new property revealed by the present calculations is the growth of a conductive core for the most massive bds .",
    "as these objects cool and contract , their interior becomes more and more degenerate ( @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron fermi temperature and @xmath55 is the electron mean molecular weight ) .",
    "electron conductivity becomes more and more important and becomes eventually the main energy transport mechanism in the central regions , instead of convection .",
    "this occurs in the core of old ( @xmath56 2 gyr ) bds in the mass range 0.03 - 0.07 @xmath45 , with a maximum extension of the conductive core @xmath57 for the more massive ones , since the maximum central density occurs near the hbmm ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 ; chabrier and baraffe 2000 ) . in this mass range ,",
    "the conductive core appears at @xmath58 2 - 3 gyr , for @xmath59 , and increases rapidly , reaching up to 50%-70% of the total mass at 10 gyr for masses @xmath60 @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the conductive core @xmath61 as a function of time for a 0.06 @xmath45 bd .",
    "we verified that these results still hold , although quantitatively different , when using previously published conductive opacities .",
    "these properties are essentially unaffected by the dust treatment in the atmosphere , since evolution depends weakly on it .    * * * figure 3 * * *    the onset and growth of a conductive core does affect the evolution .",
    "once conduction sets in at the center , it increases dramatically the efficiency of energy transport compared to convection ( @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the electron fermi velocity ) , decreasing the internal temperature gradient and yielding a cooler central temperature for a given energy flux @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the conductive opacity ) .",
    "this increases electron degeneracy at the center ( @xmath67 decreases ) . in first approximation , retaining only the zero - temperature electron contribution and the kinetic ionic contribution , the radius of a bd can be written @xmath68 where @xmath69 cm is the zero - temperature ( fully degenerate , @xmath70 ) radius ( stevenson , 1991 ) .",
    "therefore the more degenerate conductive object contracts towards a slightly smaller radius , yielding a larger release of gravitational energy @xmath71 within a kelvin - helmoltz time .",
    "this larger energy source increases the total binding energy of the star :    @xmath72=\\int_m gm\\delta ( { 1\\over r})dm\\ , -\\int_m \\delta \\tilde udm\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 is the specific internal energy , yielding a larger luminosity @xmath41 for a given age , i.e. slowing down the cooling time @xmath74 of the bd , since :    @xmath75    [ cool ]    where we have neglected the nuclear source of energy arising from some residual hydrogen - burning ( see e.g. figure 2 of chabrier and baraffe 2000 ) .    as an example , for a 10 gyr old 0.06 @xmath45 bd , @xmath32 is 15% larger and @xmath41 is 30% brighter when conduction is taken into account .",
    "an effect difficult to verify observationally , however , given the faintness of such old bds .",
    "note that the onset of a conductive core occurs only for @xmath76 gyr and is thus inconsequential for the application of the lithium - test , which concerns only younger objects ( see e.g. cb97 ) .",
    "in this section , we compare the present models with available observations of late - m , l- and methane - dwarfs in various cmds .",
    "the comparison is limited to objects with known distances .",
    "although trigonometric parallaxes have been determined for several 2mass and denis l - dwarfs ( dahn et al .",
    "2000 ) , the only methane dwarf with known distance is gl229b .      * * * figure 4 * * *    figure [ fig4 ] compares models and various observations in a @xmath77-@xmath78-@xmath79 cmd .",
    "three l - dwarfs of the dahn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample are known to be very close binary systems ( martn , brandner & basri 1999 ; koerner et al .",
    "1999 ) with nearly equal mass components and their magnitude is corrected in the cmds to take into account this property .",
    "models with different dust treatments are displayed for ages of 0.1 gyr ( only for the dusty models ; short - dash line ) and 1 gyr ( solid line ) . for @xmath80 1 gyr ,",
    "dusty isochrones are hardly distinguishable from one another in any of the following optical ( @xmath81 ) and near - ir ( @xmath82 ) cmds , although the same masses correspond obviously to different magnitudes , and are not shown for sake of clarity .",
    "the properties of the dusty models for different ages are displayed in tables 1 - 5 .",
    "note that we do not give the h - magnitude .",
    "indeed , the present models overestimate the flux in this band and work remains to be done to understand this shortcoming .",
    "we also give the lithium - abundance depletion for these models for applications of the lithium - test .",
    "the cond models displayed in figure 4 ( long - dash line ) cover the mass range between 0.08 @xmath45 ( @xmath83 ) and 0.03 @xmath45 ( @xmath84 ) at 1 gyr .    for @xmath77 brighter than 20 ( @xmath85 k ) ,",
    "the nextgen models ( dash - dot ) are significantly bluer by 0.3 - 0.4 mag in @xmath86 than the dusty models .",
    "this is due to the recent improved tio line list ( schwenke , 1998 ) included in the dusty atmospheres ( allard et al .",
    "2000a , b ) , while the nextgen models used the previous line list by jorgensen ( 1994 ) . as emphasized in bcah98 , the nextgen models predict too blue ( up to @xmath87 mag ) optical colors compared to observations for @xmath88 ( see figure 6 of bcah98 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , the new tio linelist improves significantly this situation ( see also allard et al .",
    "2000b ) and confirms the fact that the previous discrepancy stemmed primarily from a lacking source of opacity shortward of 1 @xmath89 m ( cf .",
    " 4.2 of bcah98 ) , and not from a major caveat in the treatment of convection .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig5 ] below , the situation is not completely satisfactory yet , with a remaining @xmath90-@xmath91 offset in colors at the bottom of the ms .    * * * figure 5 * * *    the dust effect is clearly seen for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , with a much more modest reddening as @xmath77 increases ( @xmath32 decreases ) for the dusty and cond models than for the dust - free models .",
    "this reflects metal and in particular tio and vo depletion due to grain formation in the cond and dusty atmospheres .",
    "these species are two main sources of absorption in the optical in the temperature - range of interest .",
    "note that , although the @xmath86 colors are similar , the dusty models are significantly fainter than the cond ones for a given mass , revealing the grain _ opacity _ which is not included in cond models , and the depressed continuum in the optical due to the opacity - induced backwarming and h@xmath48o dissociation ( allard et al .",
    "interestingly enough , the same trend of change of slope in @xmath86 colors at @xmath94 appears in the available observations , but at a @xmath87 mag bluer limit , i.e. @xmath95 , than the theoretical predictions .",
    "this builds confidence in our basic treatment of grain formation but suggests that the gas depletion of the main absorbing species in the optical ( tio , vo , feh ) is underestimated in the present theory . note in passing the limited interest of the v - band for bd search , with most massive bds older than 1 gyr being at @xmath96 .",
    "the saturation in optical colors is even more drastic in @xmath97 ( figure [ fig5 ] ) , where the dusty models yield almost constant @xmath97 below @xmath98 k ( @xmath99 14 ) at @xmath1002.4 - 2.5 . as seen in the figure , the distribution of various objects observed in these colors at the bottom of and below the main sequence",
    ", either in the field or in the pleiades cluster , not only shows the same saturation effect as predicted by the models but is quantitatively in very good agreement with the predicted colors . as mentioned above , however , the @xmath101 mag offset above @xmath102 k is still present .",
    "the cond models predict bluer colors as @xmath32 decreases , and in general more flux in the @xmath103 bands at a given @xmath32 than the dusty models .",
    "this stems from ( i ) the absence of grain opacity in cond models and ( ii ) the backwarming effect in the dusty models ( see figure 1 ) which destroys ir - absorbing species such as e.g. h@xmath48 , h@xmath48o , allowing more flux to escape at longer wavelengths .    although the l3.5 dwarf 2mass - wj0036159 + 182 ( @xmath77=21.15 , @xmath104=18.15 , @xmath105=15.92 , @xmath106-@xmath107=2.23)(reid et al .",
    "1999 ) seems to be lying on the cond track , it is probably misleading and reveals probable errors in the photometry .",
    "indeed , the near - ir colors of this object are not reproduced by the cond models , but rather by the dusty ones ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] displays the same comparisons in near - ir colors @xmath108 ) .",
    "as already mentioned by leggett et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the dusty models give the best fit to ir photometry of l- and very late m - dwarfs .",
    "they explain the very red colors characteristic of these objects in terms of the backwarming of the atmosphere due to grain absorption , yielding a reduction of the band strengths of the main ir absorbers , like e.g. h@xmath48o , as proposed initially by tsuji et al .",
    "such red colors are impossible to reproduce with dust - free opacity models ( nextgen and cond ) .",
    "note that for @xmath109 brighter than @xmath47 11 , the dusty models are slightly bluer in @xmath110 , by @xmath470.1 - 0.2 mag , than the nextgen models .",
    "this arises from the use of different h@xmath48o line lists : miller et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in nextgen and the recent ames list ( partridge and schwenke , 1997 ) in dusty models .",
    "although less complete for the higher energy transitions than the ames line list , the miller et al .",
    "( 1994 ) list yields better agreement between models and ir photometric observations for @xmath85-@xmath111 k ( where dust does not affect the colors ) , since it relies on better potential surfaces for high temperatures ( see allard et al .",
    "2000b for details ) .",
    "below @xmath112 k , these transitions are no longer important and the more complete ames water linelist is to be used .",
    "below this temperature , however , dust opacity is the main ingredient which shapes the ir colors , and the choice of the water line list is less crucial for photometric analysis .",
    "this illustrates again the remaining shortcomings in the present theory arising from still partially inaccurate molecular opacities , and stresses the need for future improvements in these inputs .    *",
    "* * figure 6 * * *    when dust opacity is neglected ( cond and nextgen ) , near - ir colors become bluer due to strong h@xmath48 , h@xmath48o , co and eventually ch@xmath113 absorption in the @xmath11 and @xmath10-bands .",
    "this yields very blue near - ir colors , with @xmath114@xmath115@xmath116 , as illustrated by the good agreement of gl229b ir colors with the cond track ( see also burrows et al .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for the cond models because of the lack of tio absorption , which extends into the j - band at these very low effective temperatures .",
    "however , the cond models overestimate the flux at and shortward of @xmath117 ( @xmath103 bands ) for gl229b ( golimowski et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the spectrum of gl229b indeed does not show strong indication for dust in its ir spectrum from 1 to 5 @xmath118 ( allard et al .",
    "1996 ; marley et al . 1996 ; tsuji et al .",
    "1996 ; oppenheimer et al . 1998 ) , but reveals discrepancies in the optical with dust - free models , as mentioned above .",
    "several solutions have been proposed for this missing source of opacity in the optical , such as a specific haze opacity due to the presence of the nearby star ( griffith et al .",
    "1998 ) or warm dust layers ( tsuji et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these suggestions , however , are based on ad - hoc hypothesis required to fit gl229b spectrum and lack robust physical grounds .",
    "the methane - dwarf sdss 1624 ( strauss et al .",
    "1999 ) , for example , does not have a hot companion , yet shows no flux blueward of 0.8 @xmath89 m , indicating a strong absorption in the optical , as does gl229b .",
    "this suggests that the source of absorption is a common atmospheric bd property , precluding the haze opacity scenario .",
    "strong alkali resonance lines ( k i , na i ) have been proposed recently as an alternative , or complementary solution ( tsuji et al . 1999 ; burrows et al .",
    "clearly this question is not settled yet and requires futher observational tests and consistent calculations .    for @xmath119 1.0 - 1.9 , good agreement is found between the data and the dusty models ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) , except for the l0-dwarf 2mass - wj0746425 + 200032 ( reid et al .",
    "1999 ) ( @xmath109=9.70 , @xmath9-@xmath10=1.25 ) , which lies significantly above both the other data and the models , making it a probable unresolved binary , as suggested by these authors .    an interesting feature of this diagram is a hint that the redder l - dwarfs of dahn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the slope of the observed l - dwarf sequence itself , seem to deviate from the dusty tracks for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the reddest observed objects having a color @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath123 1800 k. if the parallax and the photometry of these objects are confirmed , this may very well illustrate gravitational settling of some grains below the photosphere for these objects , as mentioned in  2.1 .",
    "this will yield less backwarming and thus progressively cooler atmospheres ( see figure 1 ) , increasing h@xmath48o , co and h@xmath124 absorption in the ir .",
    "once ch@xmath113 forms near the photosphere , the integrated flux over the k - band is strongly reduced , although the flux still peaks around 1 @xmath89 m , leading to gl229b - like colors .",
    "whether this transition occurs sharply or smoothly remains to be elucidated .",
    "note that the co - ch@xmath113 transition occurs gradually with some of the two elements being present in the stability field of the other so that cool stars do contain some limited amount of methane and co has been detected in gl229b ( noll et al .",

    ", there should be indeed a `` no - bd land '' in the region @xmath126 with a sharp transition for @xmath127 k , the temperature of formation of methane in the @xmath128 bar range .",

    "( 1997 ) models .",
    "the reason of their poor fit in the h - band , however , compared with the present models , remains unclear .",

    "( 1997 ) was based on previous , less accurate observations of gl229b , as mentioned above , and does not hold anymore .",
    "finally , figure 7 displays @xmath145 versus @xmath146 ) .",
    "the @xmath10 band is affected by h@xmath48 , h@xmath48o and ch@xmath113 absorption , whereas the @xmath145 is strongly affected by methane ( allard et al .",
    "1996 ; marley et al . 1996",
    "; tsuji et al .",
    "the trends displayed in the previous ir diagrams are replicated , with a severe reddening due to grain backwarming effects in the dusty models , but also a substantial reddening for the cond and grainless model , due to the strong ch@xmath113 absorption in the k - band .",
    "the magnitudes of brown dwarfs and very - low - mass stars with dusty atmospheres for several isochrones are displayed in tables 1 - 5 .",
    "we stress , however , that the flux for these objects peaks around 1 @xmath147 , so that j , z and h remain the most favorable bands for detection .    * * * figure 7 * * *",
    "the comparisons in various cmds displayed in the previous section illustrate the good general agreement between the present theory of evolution of very - low - mass stars and brown dwarfs with dusty atmospheres and observations .",
    "the models which include grain formation _ and _ opacity in the atmosphere explain successfully the ir colors of late m- and l - dwarfs , as well as their blue loop in the optical , although improvement is still needed for the latter case to reach accurate quantitative agreement with observations . as shown by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999a ) for gd165b and ruiz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for kelu-1 , the dusty models improve also significantly the agreement with observed ir spectra .",
    "the present models provide a consistent description of the physics going on in the interior and the atmosphere of objects at the bottom of and below the main sequence , from m - dwarfs to l - dwarfs .",
    "they can be used with reasonable confidence in the ir bands ( @xmath148 ) to calibrate the main properties , mass , age , @xmath32 , @xmath41 of identified late - m and l - dwarfs .",
    "shortcomings still appear in the optical , whatever the treatment of dust , in spite of noticeable improvement ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) already pointed out a possible missing source of opacity in the optical to explain the observed @xmath86 colors of m - dwarfs between @xmath123 3600 k and @xmath47 2300 k. although the new tio linelist from ames ( schwenke , 1998 ) improves appreciably the situation ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , a @xmath101 mag discrepancy still remains with observations ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "below @xmath47 2300 k , comparison of the dusty models with observations in @xmath86 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) strongly suggests either an underestimate of optical opacities or an underestimate of the depletion of molecular absorbers during grain condensation .",
    "problems appear as well in spectroscopic analysis of atomic line profiles where the dusty models can not match the optical observations ( tinney et al .",
    "1998 ; basri et al .",
    "another remaining caveat of the present theory arises from shortcomings in the absorption coefficients of water , yielding a @xmath90 mag offset in @xmath110 for @xmath149 k when using the most recent h@xmath48o line list ( see e.g. figure 6 ) .",
    "finally , the optical spectrum of gl229b remains to be described accurately .",
    "present cond synthetic spectra overestimate the optical flux , pointing out a missing source of opacity .",
    "work in this direction is under progress .",
    "although it is important to solve these problems and eliminate these shortcomings , it is obvious from the various cmds that substellar objects must be searched in the near - infrared .",
    "brown dwarfs around 1500 k radiate more than 90% of their energy at wavelengths longward of @xmath150 m . the flux peaks at 1.1 and 1.3 @xmath89 m , and @xmath151 are the favored broadband filters for detection .",
    "it is thus reinsuring , given the complexity of the underlying physics , that the present models of dusty substellar objects describe the observations in near - ir bands with reasonable success .",
    "if dust formation and absorption successfully explain the transition between m- and l - dwarfs , a theoretical and observational gap still exists between l- and methane - dwarfs .",
    "models including dust opacity reach rapidly very red ir colors ( @xmath114 ) @xmath152 2 , whereas observations of the reddest or faintest l dwarfs show a saturation of their ( @xmath114 ) and ( @xmath138 ) colors at 1.9 and 1.2 respectively , which corresponds to @xmath32 @xmath47 1700 - 1800 k ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this very likely illustrates ongoing dynamical processes near the photosphere .",
    "as outlined in  2.1 , the proximity of the top of the convection zone from the photosphere may induce turbulent mixing and prevent the grains to diffuse downward .",
    "as convection retreats to deeper layers for cooler objects , gravitational settling of condensed species may lead to cooler atmospheres , because of the decreasing opacity , with a transition to very blue near infrared colors once methane forms near the photosphere .",
    "these dynamical processes of grain formation and diffusion are not included in the theory yet and represent indeed the next major challenge .",
    "theory definitely needs some guidance from observations through this puzzle , by getting spectra , parallaxes and photometry of the coolest l - dwarfs and by either filling or confirming the presently expected brown dwarf dearth between the coolest l - dwarfs and the hottest methane dwarfs around @xmath153 k.    various isochrones for the dusty models from 10@xmath154 yr to 10@xmath155 yr , covering a range of mass from 0.01 @xmath45 to 0.1 @xmath45 and @xmath32 from 900k to 3000k are available by anonymous ftp ( same format as table 1 ) :                  we are very grateful to c. dahn and h. harris for providing data prior to publication and to a. potekhin for providing the conductive opacities .",
