    "chevalier & dwarkadas based their model on the appearance of x - rays ( beuermann , brandt , & pietsch 1994 ; gorenstein , hughes , & tucker 1994 ) , and reappearance and subsequent evolution of radio emission ( staveley - smith et al . 1992 ; ball et al .",

    "is related to the interacting - winds model of blondin & lundqvist ( 1993 ) and martin & arnett ( 1995 ) , though cd95 also include the ionizing radiation from the progenitor .",
    "the main difference compared to the earlier models is the existence of a rather dense ( @xmath11 ) , photoionized red supergiant wind inside the denser swept up shell of red supergiant wind . as in the previous models ,",
    "a large asymmetry of the density in the red supergiant wind seems necessary for the inner ring observed around the supernova ( e.g. , jakobsen et al .",
    "1991 ) to form .",
    "in the following we will refer to the photoionized red supergiant wind as the `` h  ii region '' .",
    "the density estimated by cd95 for the h  ii region was confirmed by borkowski , blondin , & mccray ( 1997 ) to give a satisfactory emission of x - rays , as well as to give a natural explanation to the presently slow expansion of the radio - emitting region ( @xmath14 on day 3200 , gaensler et al .",
    "1997 ) ; while the supernova ejecta may expand almost freely in the blue supergiant wind , they slow down to the observed expansion rate in the dense h  ii region ( cd95 ) .    further possible support to the model of cd95 is the diffuse [ o  iii ] emission inside the inner ring reported by wang et al .",
    "the level of this emission is close to what wang et al .",
    "claim should come from the h  ii region in the model of cd95 . here",
    "we expand on the modeling of the line emission from this gas .",

    ". this knowledge has implications for estimates of the type of progenitor and the properties of the blue supergiant wind inside the h  ii region . knowing the density structure inside the inner ring helps to predict the ejecta / ring collision , and to constrain the initial velocity of the ejecta .    in  2",
    "we discuss the geometry and density of the h  ii region , and in  3 the flash ionization of this gas . the line emission from the ionized gas",

    "cd95 discussed a 1-d model for the formation of the presupernova nebula .",
    "we have updated this model with recent observations to estimate the density and temperature of the h  ii region .",

    "following chevalier ( 1998 ) , we assume that the radio turn - on occurs around 1150 days and that the ejecta then have reached @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath18  cm , if we again assume 50 kpc for the distance .    with a density of @xmath11 ( cd95 ) ,",
    "the ionization balance in the h  ii region is nearly in steady state before the supernova flash . if we assume that he / h  @xmath19 , as derived for the inner ring ( lundqvist et al .",
    "1998 ) , case b recombination of hydrogen , and use the extent of the h  ii region found above , we can relate the density of the h  ii region , @xmath20 , to the number of ionizing photons put out by the progenitor per second , @xmath21 .",
    "if helium is not ionized by the progenitor ( see below ) , we find    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the gas temperature .",
    "we have in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) taken into account that some of the ionizing photons are consumed behind the ionization front in the ring , rather than in the low - density h  ii region .",
    "we have called the rate of consumption of ionizing photons in the ring @xmath24 .",
    "a rough limit on @xmath24 can be obtained if one assumes that the ionization front is at a distance from the inside of the ring corresponding to optical depth unity at 13.6  ev for neutral gas .",
    "for a temperature of 5000  k and a hydrogen density of @xmath25 in the ring this means that @xmath26  s@xmath27 .",

    "while we postpone a more detailed discussion on this to mellema & lundqvist 1998 [ henceforth ml98 ] , we note that eqn .",
    "( 1 ) provides an upper limit on @xmath20 if we put @xmath28 .",

    "abundances are the same as in the calculations for the inner ring by lundqvist et al .",

    "the atomic data are also the same .",
    "we find that the temperature in the h  ii region is in the range @xmath33  k , and that helium is indeed neutral .",
    "as there is some uncertainty in the iron abundance of the gas ( borkowski et al .",
    "1997 ) , we have also run a model with a factor of 2 depletion of iron so that fe / h  @xmath34 .",
    "fe  ii cooling then becomes less important , and the temperature is slightly higher , @xmath35  k. it seems clear , however , that @xmath23 must be substantially lower than the 8000  k assumed by cd95 .",
    "this has implications for models of the dynamics of the system ( see  5.5 ) . as a typical value for @xmath23",
    "we have adopted @xmath36  k. inserting this into eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , along with @xmath31  s@xmath27 , gives @xmath37 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 in panagia ( 1973 ) were derived for @xmath38  k. a lower value of @xmath23 gives a slightly lower value of @xmath21 , so a better limit on @xmath5 in our case is therefore @xmath39 .",
    "this limit is somewhat higher than the density used by borkowski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( @xmath40  amu@xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath10 for he / h=0.20 ) to obtain good agreement between their modeled x - ray spectra and the data of hasinger , aschenbach , & trmper ( 1996 ) .",
    "we note , however , that we only obtain an upper limit on @xmath5 , and that the value of borkowski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) should be larger if the x - ray emitting gas is more concentrated to the equatorial plane than in their model .",
    "our limit on @xmath5 , and the x - ray density are therefore consistent .    guided by this discussion ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath42 as a standard density for the h  ii region in our models in  3 , though we have also tested other densities .",
    "a higher density could be possible ( see eqn . [ 2 ] ) , if the progenitor was of earlier spectral type than b3  ia .",
    "we note from panagia ( 1973 ) that @xmath21 increases rapidly with earlier spectral type .",
    "the spectrum also gets harder , which results in higher @xmath23 .",
    "both these effects permit higher limit on @xmath5 using eqn .",
    "( 2 ) . for example , a b2  ia produces @xmath43 times more ionizing photons than a b3  ia star , corresponding to a factor of @xmath44 higher limit on @xmath5 .",
    "low - density cases are also important to investigate , not just because the x - ray models indicate a low density and the fact that @xmath24 may be non - negligible , but also because the density in the h  ii region is expected to decrease with distance away from the equatorial plane .",
    "how big this density decrease might be is uncertain , but it is unlikely to be as large as in the external red supergiant wind because the sound speed of the gas in the h  ii region , @xmath45 , is only marginally lower than the velocity of the inner ring ( @xmath46 ; crotts & heathcote 1992 , cumming & lundqvist 1997 ) ; overpressure in the equatorial plane of the h  ii gas will create a transverse flow ( chevalier 1998 ) of nearly isothermal gas to partially compensate for the lower density in the red supergiant wind toward the poles .",
    "it seems plausible that one has to go to rather small polar angles to encounter a density which is a factor of @xmath47 lower than in the equatorial plane ( see ml98 for further details ) .    in our models in",
    " 3 , the density therefore ranges between @xmath48 .",
    "note that when the gas is fully ionized , the electron density is a factor @xmath49 higher than @xmath5 .",
    "the temperature of the gas just prior to the supernova flash was set to 4500  k throughout the h  ii region .",
    "the exact value is not important for our results . while hydrogen is ionized , helium is supposed to be neutral .",
    "to simulate the ionizing radiation from the supernova outburst , we have used the 500full1 and 500full2 models of ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) .",
    "both these bursts were used by lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 ; henceforth lf96 ) to give good fits to the light curves of the narrow uv lines from the ring ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1997 ) , and they appear to be limiting cases to the actual burst of sn 1987a ( blinnikov et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the degree of ionization in the h  ii region is therefore similar to that in the innermost part of the ring in the models of lf96 ; in the case of 500full1 , the dominant ionization stages of c , n and o are c  v  vi , n  vi and o  vi  vii , while 500full2 with its higher number of ionizing photons ( @xmath50 versus @xmath51 ) and peak color temperature ( @xmath52 versus @xmath53  k ) results in c  v  vi , n  vi  vii and o  vii .",
    "the main difference of the h  ii region compared to the inner ring is the temperature . while the ring is initially neutral , the ionized hydrogen in the h  ii region can not contribute to the heating of the gas .",
    "this was also discovered by lundqvist & fransson ( 1991 ) when they calculated the post - explosion temperature of the preionized freely expanding blue supergiant wind .",
    "thus , instead of having maximum temperatures of @xmath54 and @xmath55  k , as are the temperatures of the inner ring for 500full1 and 500full2 , respectively , the h  ii region is in the case of @xmath42 only heated to @xmath56  k and @xmath57  k , respectively , with the temperature increasing from the inner edge of the h  ii region to the outer . for @xmath58 \\cm3 $ ] , the maximum temperatures are @xmath59 $ ]  k and @xmath60 $ ]  k , for 500full1 and 500full2 , respectively .",
    "the low density of the h  ii region ensures slow cooling and recombination . as a matter of fact , even in models with @xmath61 , the temperature decrease is only a few per cent until day 1150 , which is when we have assumed that the ejecta reach the h  ii region . from this epoch",
    ", we have included the observed x - ray emission of the ejecta / wind interaction ( hasinger et al .",
    "1996 ) approximated by ,    @xmath62    here @xmath63 is the photon energy in ev and @xmath64 the time in days since the explosion . while the x - ray emission is unimportant for the ionization of the ring ( lundqvist et al .",
    "1998 ) , it affects marginally the gas in the h  ii region . for example , the difference in abundances of n  iii and o  iii for models with and without x - rays are of the order a few per cent at the present epoch ( @xmath65  days ) , and ions of higher ionization stages are affected even less .",
    "a more important effect of the shock than providing ionizing photons is that its outward propagation decreases the fraction of the h  ii region that can emit narrow lines .",
    "we have assumed that the shock velocity remains constant at @xmath66 after it has reached the h  ii region . in the equatorial plane",
    "this means that the shock has now ( @xmath65  days ) reached @xmath67  cm .",
    "if we use the 500full1 burst , the temperature in the unshocked h  ii region at the present epoch ( @xmath65  days ) is @xmath68  k , regardless of the density , while for 500full2 , it is @xmath69  k for @xmath70 and @xmath71  k for the higher densities .",
    "for all these temperatures , the recombination time for n  vi to n  v is @xmath72  days ( see figure  1 of lundqvist & fransson , 1991 ) , which means that only @xmath73 of n  vi has recombined to ionization stage v , or lower .",
    "a somewhat larger fraction of oxygen has recombined to the same ionization stages",
    ". however , almost no recombination proceeds to ionization stage ii of either element because of fast collisional ionization from stage ii to iii . this immediately tells us that [ o  ii ] and [ n  ii ] lines must be observationally unimportant ( see also  4 ) . the way the ionization depends on density , and the rather marginal difference in ionization for the two markedly different bursts we have used",
    ", shows that the burst spectrum is in general less important for the evolution of the ionization structure than the gas density .",
    "borkowski et al .  ( 1997 ) showed that the interaction of the h  ii region with the blast wave should give rise to broad emission lines , especially n  v  @xmath41240 and o  vi  @xmath41034 .",
    "although the lines are weaker than the broad emission lines from the reverse shock , they will constitute an increasing fraction of the total broad emission with time .",
    "the flux from the blast wave scales linearly with the preshock fraction of n and o in ionization stages n  i  v , @xmath74 , and o  i  vi , @xmath75 , respectively . for n  v  @xmath41240 , borkowski et al . adopted @xmath76 and for o  vi  @xmath41034 they adopted @xmath77 , considered to be lower limits at @xmath78 years .",
    "the value of @xmath74 used by borkowski et al .",
    "is similar to what we estimate in  3 , assuming the gas is initially only in n  vi .",
    "looking more closely at our simulations , we note that @xmath74 scales nearly linearly with density , as expected . in particular for @xmath42 , @xmath79 for 500full1 ( 500full2 ) .",
    "the lower value for 500full2 is due to a slightly higher temperature , and because @xmath80% of the nitrogen starts out at n  vii instead of n  vi . the value of @xmath74 adopted by borkowski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) therefore seems adequate for the density they used .",
    "the value we find for @xmath75 at @xmath78 years is @xmath81 for 500full1 and @xmath82 for 500full2 , for the range of densities we have tested .",
    "this could mean a slightly higher o  vi  @xmath41034 flux from the blast wave than in the models by borkowski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the slow evolution of the temperature and ionization of the h  ii region has the interesting effect that the uv lines that once dominated the emission from the inner ring ( he  ii  @xmath83 , c iii ]  @xmath84 , n  iii ]  @xmath85 , n  iv ]  @xmath86 , n  v  @xmath2 and o  iii ]  @xmath87 ; cf .",
    "sonneborn et al .",
    "1997 ) , could still be emitted by the h  ii region .",

    "( 1997 ) since these are used in  5.3 to put limits on @xmath5 .",
    "the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) observations of the other lines are too close to the noise level ( which is of the order of , or slightly less than @xmath88  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 for the dereddened fluxes ; cf .",
    "lf96 ) to be useful for our analysis here . in the figures",
    ", we have also included the important lines [ o  iii ]  @xmath90 and o  vi  @xmath3 .",
    "figures  1 and 2 are for two cases : one where we have taken into account the decrease of the volume of the unshocked h  ii region with time , and another where this decrease has not been included .",
    "the latter could be more realistic if the h  ii region is not spherically symmetric , but instead bulges out to large radii for small polar angles .",
    "if the density of the h  ii region varies strongly with polar angle , a combination of models with different densities should be more realistic .",
    "the models in figures  1 and 2 could be used for such an analysis , if the fluxes are rescaled according to the expected volumes of the different density components .",
    "the fluxes of all lines , except o  vi  @xmath41034 , are extremely density - sensitive , which implies that the emission in a multi - density environment will be heavily weighted toward the component with the highest density .",
    "presumably , such a component would reside close to the equatorial plane .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show the same general behavior of the light curves , except for the o  vi line , which decays much faster in the 500full1 case .",
    "this is a result of the slightly higher initial ionization of oxygen in the 500full2 case .",
    "this , in combination with an also slightly higher temperature in the case of 500full2 , makes recombination to o  iii proceed somewhat slower than for 500full1 . to display this more clearly",
    ", we show in figure  3 relative line fluxes at 4250 days , as functions of @xmath5 .",
    "the reference line is n  v  @xmath41240 .    as described in figure 3 , the displayed models are for four cases .",
    "from these models , it is obvious that while the absolute fluxes of the lines differ markedly depending on whether the full , or reduced size of the h  ii region is included ( see figures  1 and 2 ) , the _ ratios _ of the lines are insensitive to the size of the emitting region ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "the ratios are , however , sensitive to the burst spectrum .",
    "in particular , the strengths of the oxygen lines relative to n  v  @xmath41240 at 4250 days differ strongly between the 500full1 and 500full2 cases , and there is also a small difference for the he  ii  @xmath83/n  v  @xmath41240 ratio .",
    "we caution that figures  13 display fluxes for the multiplets of the lines .",
    "in particular , the n  v and o  vi lines have two components , n  v  @xmath911238.82 , 1242.80 and o  vi  @xmath911031.93 , 1037.62 , with the shortward components being twice as bright as the longward .",
    "the separation of the components corresponds to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . for n  v  @xmath41240",
    ", the separation of its components should be large enough not to blend in stis spectra .",
    "the lines from the h  ii region are intrinsically narrow . in the ring plane",
    ", the velocity of the gas is expected to be lower than for the ring itself ( see ml98 ) .",
    "it is in fact likely that thermal broadening of the lines are comparable to the velocity broadening , especially for the he  ii line , which has a thermal broadening of @xmath94 . in any case , the lines are significantly narrower than the emission from the hot spot or the ejecta / h  ii region interaction , and should in stis spectra really trace the spatial extent of the emission .",
    "figures  1 and 2 show that the line emission from the h  ii region is sensitive to gas density .",
    "in particular , this is true for lines from ions of ionization stages iii and iv .",
    "it is therefore interesting that wang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have reported a detection of diffuse [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 emission from the projected region inside the inner ring .",
    "the flux at 2500 days was @xmath95 } = ( 0.9\\pm0.3)\\ee{-14}$ ]  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 .",
    "we have included their observation in figures  1 , 2 and 4 , where figure  4 shows calculated [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 fluxes at 2500 days as functions of @xmath5 for the same models as in figure  3 .",
    "it is evident that the [ o  iii ] flux is extremely sensitive to density ( roughly as @xmath95 } \\propto n_{\\rm h}^{5.4}$ ] ) , but that it is also somewhat sensitive to the burst spectrum .",
    "if we include the decrease of the h  ii region due to the shock propagation , the calculated [ o  iii ] flux agrees with the observed when @xmath8 for 500full1 , and @xmath9 for 500full2 , where @xmath7 is the filling factor of the gas . because our models are for spherical symmetry ( cf . above ) , a low value of @xmath7 would apply if the gas is concentrated to the equatorial plane .",
    "the values we find for @xmath5 from [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 are slightly higher than that of wang et al .",
    "this is not surprising since wang et al . only studied the 500full1 case , and did not include the decrease of the h  ii region due to the shock propagation . in both our study and that of wang et al . , the estimated densities are upper limits .",
    "this is not just because @xmath7 could be less than unity , but also because part of the diffuse [ o  iii ] emission could be produced elsewhere than in the h  ii region , and that it is only when seen in projection that the emission appears to come from inside the inner ring .",
    "( note that wang et al . only detect and measure emission from inside the ring . )    our upper limits on @xmath5 from the [ o  iii ] line may seem compatible with the estimated density from x - ray models of the supernova ( borkowski et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath10 ( for he / h = 0.20 ) .",
    "however , the factor of @xmath44 difference between the x - ray and [ o  iii ] densities is not so easy to understand .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the [ o  iii ] emission probes gas further out in the h  ii region than that at the shock front , and that the density further out is higher .",
    "a problem with this interpretation is , however , that the observed [ o  iii ] emission is diffuse and not concentrated toward the ring ( wang et al .",
    "another possibility could be that the spectrum of the burst was softer than in 500full1 .",
    "this would give a lower value of @xmath5 in the [ o  iii ] models .",
    "again , this is rather unlikely because this would contradict the finding of lf96 that the burst spectrum should be at least as hard as 500full1 in order to model the emission from the inner ring ( see also  5.3 ) .",
    "the successful modeling of the uv emission lines from the ring also rules out that poor atomic data could cause the different densities in x - ray and [ o  iii ] models .",
    "( the same data were used both here , and by lf96 . )",
    "we are therefore left with the possibilities that the observed [ o  iii ] emission at 2500 days is primarily formed elsewhere than in the h  ii region , or that the x - ray models somehow underestimate the density .",
    "if the x - ray density ( @xmath10 ) is correct , figure 4 shows that the expected [ o  iii ] flux at 2500 days is of order @xmath96  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 .",
    "this is far too low to be detected , and the detected [ o  iii ] emission can not come from the h  ii region if the density is this low .",
    "possible sites of contaminating emission could be the outer rings , the walls of the bipolar nebula , and/or the ejecta / h  ii region interaction region .",
    "it should be noted that the observations of wang et al . were made through [ o  iii ] filters which can not discriminate between broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the x - ray density could be higher than @xmath10 if the volume of the x - ray emitting gas is smaller than in the model of borkowski et al .",
    "this could actually be the case since borkowski et al .",
    "assume a rather small value of @xmath97 compared to ours , @xmath98  cm and @xmath99  cm , respectively .",
    "if a smaller x - ray emitting region could allow for a density as high as @xmath100 , this could be consistent with a b3 ia nature of the progenitor ( see  2 ) .",
    "however , even for such a high density , the [ o  iii ] flux at 2500 days would only be of order @xmath101  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 .",
    "so , for this density too , [ o  iii ] emission from elsewhere than the h  ii region is needed to obtain the flux measured by wang et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also give an upper limit to the h@xmath13 flux at 2500 days . assuming a similar spatial distribution of h@xmath13 compared to that of [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 , their h@xmath13 flux is @xmath102  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 . in our most favorable model for h@xmath13 emission",

    "the dereddened flux is @xmath107  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 , though there is a large scatter in the data ( see figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "adopting this flux , our simulations put an upper limit on @xmath5 from n  v  @xmath41240 , which is @xmath6 for 500full1 , and nearly the same for 500full2 .",
    "this limit is close to what we find for the [ o  iii ] flux at 2500 days , which again indicates that the detected [ o  iii ] emission does not mainly come from the h  ii region .",
    "obviously , more observations are needed to explain the discrepancy described in  5.1 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath108  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 is a reasonable limit to detect [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 at 4250 days , the density has to be @xmath109 for a burst like 500full1 to give rise to detectable [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "although , such a density is on the high side compared to x - ray models , it can not be ruled out from our present knowledge .    to probe lower values of @xmath5 one should focus on the n  iv ] , n  v and o  vi lines .",
    "they have high excitation energies , and are therefore less confused with emission from the low - temperature inner ring than , e.g. , [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 , which has had a rather constant temperature of @xmath110  k since @xmath111  days ( lundqvist et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there is some contamination of n  v  @xmath41240 and o  vi  @xmath41034 from the shocked gas in the ejecta / wind interaction zone ( borkowski et al .",
    "this diffuse emission is characterized by a range of velocities from a few hundred@xmath112 ( in possible hot spots ) up to @xmath113 ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1998 ) . to separate out those emissions from the narrow lines from the h  ii region , it is essential that the spectral resolution is @xmath114 .",
    "this is achieved with both the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse ) _ for o  vi  @xmath41034 , and _",
    "hst_/stis for the rest of the lines .    at a density of @xmath42 and for 500full1 , the expected fluxes of the o  vi , n  v and n  iv ] lines are @xmath115 , @xmath115 and @xmath116  ergs  s@xmath27  @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "including reddening , which introduces the correction factors @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , for @xmath104 ( cf .  above ) , and the possibility that @xmath120 , the lines may still be observable . for 500full2 , the fluxes of the o  vi and n  v lines are similar to those in models using 500full1 , whereas n  iv ] is down by a factor of @xmath47 ( cf . figs .",
    "1 and 2 ) . lines from ionization stage iii will not be observable for any of the bursts , unless the density is higher .",
    "however , if it is , these lines will be extremely useful , since , e.g. , the o  vi/[o  iii ] and o  vi / o  iii ] line ratios are sensitive to the burst spectrum . at a density of @xmath121 , the prospects of detecting any lines but the o  vi and n  v lines seem futile .    although the uv lines are the most useful to observe in order to narrow down the value of @xmath5 , limits on [ o  iii ]  @xmath45007 are certainly useful too . using stis at the present epoch when the [ o  iii ] emission from the h  ii region should be stronger than at 2500 days ,",
    "means that [ o  iii ] can probe lower densities than at 2500 days .",
    "as stated above , the [ o  iii ] line may also be useful to place limits on the burst spectrum when combined with the o  vi line .",
    "lf96 found that a successful modeling of the early uv lines from the inner ring requires that the inner part of the ring be ionized to at least n  vi .",
    "obviously , this means that also the h  ii region should be ionized to n  vi , or higher . while this in accord with our results in  3 , there are possible indications from the early uv line emission studied by _ iue _ ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1997 ) that the ionization of the h  ii region could have been lower .",
    "the _ iue _ observations showed that the n  v  @xmath41240 flux turned on between @xmath122 days , and that n  iv ]  @xmath41486 turned on a few days later , some time between @xmath123 days . that this is just a recombination effect in the ring",
    "is not supported by the results of lf96 .",
    "it is more likely that the early n  v  @xmath41240 emission comes from a separate region which has a shorter light travel time than the near side of the ring , and that this gas is devoid of n  iv .",
    "possible such sites could be the h  ii region , or a part of the bipolar nebula .",
    "if the early n  v  @xmath41240 emission comes from the h  ii region , the emitting gas can certainly not be spherically symmetric , since _ iue _",
    "would otherwise have detected n  v  @xmath41240 much earlier than at 80.6 days . to be consistent with the observations ,",
    "the part of the h  ii region possibly emitting n  v  @xmath41240 should instead be concentrated toward the ring , with an inner edge of its emission at @xmath124 , assuming that n  iv ]  @xmath41486 only comes from the inner ring . this radius is not very different from our assumed inner radius of the h  ii region , @xmath125 . the small separation in time between the turn - on of n  v  @xmath41240 and n  iv ]  @xmath41486 is therefore not enough to rule out that the @xmath11 gas in h  ii region could be responsible for the early n  v  @xmath41240 emission .",
    "it is , however , difficult to tie such a scenario into our model , especially since we find that nitrogen is ionized to n  vi  vii throughout the h  ii region even for densities substantially higher than @xmath126 , and we have already ruled out such high densities as the general density of the h  ii region on several grounds ( cf .",
    "a possibility is that the tentative high - density region emitting early n  v  @xmath41240 could be similar to the inward protrusion observed by garnavich , kirshner , & challis ( 1997a ) and sonneborn et al .",
    "if this is correct , the protrusion should be ionized beyond n  iv from the outset .",
    "such a protrusion should reveal itself within the next few years as a hot spot on the near side of the ring .",
    "the alternative scenario for the early n  v  @xmath41240 emission is that the line forms in the presumably existing bipolar nebula . again",
    ", this gas should not contain any n  iii or n  iv zones giving rise to detectable emission from the outset .",
    "another possible indication of early n  v in the h  ii region is that resonance scattering in the h  ii region by n  v  @xmath911238.82 , 1240.80 may be necessary to explain the somewhat delayed peak of the n  v  @xmath41240 light curve compared to the peak of the other uv lines ( sonneborn et al .",
    "however , skipping the single high data point for n  v  @xmath41240 at @xmath127 days , lf96 showed that the expected scattering in the bipolar nebula is sufficient to delay the n  v  @xmath41240 emission . to check",
    "whether the h  ii region could add additional scattering , we have calculated the column density of n  v through the h  ii region in our models .",
    "we find that the column density is too low ( @xmath128 @xmath89 ) in all models to cause an optical depth unity in n  v  @xmath911238.82 , 1240.80 .",
    "while the column density of the h  ii region in our spherically symmetric models is low , a larger column density may be obtained along the line of sight to the rear side of the ring if the h  ii region bulges out far from the equatorial plane . the line of sight to the rear side of the ring could then pass through geometrically thick parts of the h  ii region on the near side of the nebula which may cause resonance scattering .",
    "however , the velocity shift between these two regions will be too large to result in any important resonance scattering .",
    "we therefore conclude that neither the early emergence of n  v  @xmath41240 , nor its subsequently delayed emission , contradict the idea that the h  ii region was ionized to at least n  vi in the equatorial plane ( see  3 . ) .",
    "this is also in accord with the idea that the inner side of the inner ring is ionized to n  vi ( lf96 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 for the h  ii region has implications for the nature of the progenitor through eqns .",
    "( 1 & 2 ) . even with the high value of @xmath5 we find from the [ o  iii ] flux at 2500 days ( see  5.1 ) , the number of ionizing photons is    @xmath129    for 500full1 ( 500full2 ) . if @xmath7 is not @xmath130 , and @xmath24 is not larger than estimated in  2 , a progenitor more powerful than b2 ia seems to be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take the density from the x - ray modeling to be a lower limit on @xmath5 , we find @xmath131  s@xmath27 .",
    "this excludes a progenitor much less powerful than a b3 ia , which has @xmath29  s@xmath27 ( panagia 1973 ) .",
    "the most likely range of spectral types of the progenitor therefore appears to be b4 ia ",
    "b2 ia , assuming a supergiant classification , which is fully consistent with the classification of rousseau et al .",
    "a caveat is , however , that multidimensional effects could require a lower photoevaporation rate of the inner ring than in the 1d case ( see  5.6 ) , which could push down the `` lower limit '' of the spectral type to less ionizing than b4 ia .      from our model of the h  ii region",
    ", we can use pressure balance arguments to sketch the structure of the blue supergiant wind interior to the h  ii region . in a 1d scenario , pressure balance between the shocked blue supergiant wind and the h  ii region gives @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the density and velocity of the freely expanding blue supergiant wind at the termination shock , i.e. , at a radius @xmath135 .",
    "the factor 0.88 stems from weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ; see also cd95 and ml98 ) .",
    "the density of the free wind is given by    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is the mass loss rate of the blue supergiant wind . from this",
    "we find that    @xmath138    which should be compared with the maximum value estimated by chevalier ( 1998 ) to be consistent with the fast expansion of nearly undecelerated ejecta , @xmath139 .",
    "eliminating @xmath137 from these expressions , we find an upper limit on @xmath135 , which is    @xmath140    if we consider @xmath141 an upper limit on wind velocities of b3 ia stars ( e.g. , lamers , snow , & lindholm 1995 ) , and use @xmath36  k , we find that @xmath135 can not be larger than @xmath142  cm for @xmath31  s@xmath27 and @xmath143 . because @xmath135 is only a weak function of ( @xmath144 ) , @xmath135 could thus be considerably smaller than the @xmath145  cm assumed by cd95 . in a 1d scenario , the region of hot shocked blue supergiant wind could therefore have a thickness of as much as @xmath146  cm .",
    "the near - vacuum of this region would not slow down the supernova ejecta appreciably , and an extremely high initial velocity of the ejecta ( @xmath147 ; chevalier 1998 ) would seem unnecessary .",
    "this agrees with explosion models of the supernova which give maximum velocities of the ejecta @xmath148 ( imshennik & nadyozhin 1989 ; ensman & burrows 1992 ; blinnikov et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the situation is different in a multidimensional scenario .",
    "while @xmath135 may still be low , the radius of the contact discontinuity will retract in the equatorial plane due to the poleward flow of the shocked blue supergiant wind ( chevalier 1998 ) .",
    "however , it should not retract too much to become incompatible with the evolution of the radio emission from the supernova , i.e. , if we believe the maximum ejecta velocity is @xmath148 .",
    "to avoid such a retraction , the pressure in the equatorial plane of the h  ii region should be lower too , compared to the 1d case .",
    "it may be that the expected poleward gas flow in the h  ii region ( chevalier 1998 ) is enough to unload the pressure in the equatorial plane to allow for a radially extended shocked blue supergiant wind .",
    "otherwise , we may have to invoke a lower photoevaporation rate than assumed in  2 to lower the pressure further .",
    "the shapes of the termination shock , and the contact discontinuity between the blue and red supergiant winds , can only be studied in greater detail by means of multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations ( chevalier 1998 ; ml98 ) .",
    "detecting narrow lines from the h  ii region , and how they vary in strength with time , would help to constrain the hydrodynamical models and to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the presupernova nebula .",
    "this would aid predictions of the ejecta / ring collision .",
    "we have calculated the temperature and ionization of the h  ii region created by the progenitor of sn 1987a .",
    "we find that prior to the explosion , the gas was probably cool , @xmath149  k , and had neutral helium .",
    "using this as input , we have calculated the ionization , temperature and line emission from the gas after it has been further heated and ionized by the radiation accompanying the supernova breakout .",
    "the models used for the breakout were 500full1 and 500full2 of ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) .",
    "we find that the temperature of the gas stays relative constant at @xmath150  k until the present epoch , and that the x - ray emission from the ejecta / wind interaction is unimportant for the evolution of temperature and ionization .",
    "the slow recombination to o  iii for the density inferred from the circumstellar x - rays , 150 a.m.u .",
    "cm@xmath27 , appears to be inconsistent with [ o  iii ] observations at @xmath152  days .",
    "this argues that the [ o  iii ] emission was probably produced elsewhere than in the h  ii region .",
    "this is also indicated by the limit on @xmath5 we find from the early _ iue _ observations of n  v  @xmath2 .",
    "better lines to probe the density of the h  ii region are instead n  v  @xmath2 and o  vi  @xmath3 .",
    "they can be observed using @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "another important line is n  iv ]  @xmath41486 , whereas lines of lower ionization will only show up if the density is a factor of @xmath47 higher than inferred from the x - rays .",
    "the fluxes of all lines could start to decline well before day @xmath155 due to the propagation of the blast wave .    the limits on density we find , together with the expected size of the h  ii region , put constraints on the nature of sk  -69.202 .",
    "we estimate that the upper limit on its spectral type is not much earlier than b2  ia , which is in accord with the classification by rousseau et al .",
    "( 1978 ) .    with the most likely inner and outer radii of the h  ii region in the equatorial plane , @xmath156 and @xmath157  cm",
    ", respectively , we find that a 1d approximation of the nebula could put the termination shock of the blue supergiant wind as close as @xmath158  cm to the star .",
    "this would mean an extended region of shocked blue supergiant wind , which would ease the fast expansion of the ejecta .",
    "how this ties into a multidimensional scenario can only be explored by 2d hydrodynamical simulations .",
