    "fragmentation is a basic stochastic process with a variety of applications ranging from geology@xcite and fracture@xcite to the breakup of liquid droplets@xcite and atomic nuclei @xcite , and impact fragmentation of solid objects @xcite .",
    "fragmentation processes are relevant to numerous seemingly unrelated problems such as spin glasses , boolean networks and genetic populations@xcite .",

    "examples include `` parking '' strategies for genome reconstruction @xcite and dna segmentation algorithms @xcite .",
    "the primary feature of the fragmentation process which underlies segmentation algorithms is that rather than continuing indefinitely , the process stops when a segment reaches an acceptable `` homogeneity '' level .",
    "furthermore , fragmentation does not continue indefinitely in impact fragmentation processes where the kinetic energy and the size of the fragments determine the number of fragmentation events .",
    "these applications lead to stochastic fragmentation processes where not only the way by which fragments are produced , but also the number of fragmentation events is subject to a random process .    in the simplest stochastic fragmentation process ,",

    "with probability @xmath0 , a newly formed fragment remains unstable , i.e , it continues to participate in fragmentation events , while with probability @xmath1 , it becomes stable , and is never fragmented again .",
    "the process is repeated for all unstable fragments until all fragments become stable . for this simple process",
    ", we show that the final length density , @xmath2 , is purely algebraic , namely @xmath3 @xcite . similar scale free behavior was observed in other fragmentation processes@xcite .",
    "stochastic fragmentation also exhibits intriguing statistical characteristics including moments which are non - self - averaging , essential singularities in the distribution of these moments , and an infinite set of singularities in the distribution of the largest and the smallest fragments .    in this paper",

    "this means that statistical properties obtained by averaging over all realizations are insufficient to probe sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "lack of self - averaging was also found in fragmentation processes that exhibit a shattering transition @xcite .",
    "it is possible to evaluate higher - order averages such as @xmath115 .",
    "however , even for small @xmath116 these averages become quite cumbersome and not terribly illuminating .",

    "the minimal number of fragments is produced when both of the first generation fragments are stable , and hence , @xmath120 .",
    "similarly for @xmath121 we obtain the recursion relation @xmath122 where the total number of fragments @xmath123 is obtained in various ways from a smaller number of fragments that appear after fragmentation of the two first generation fragments . specifically ,",
    "if exactly one of the first generation fragments is unstable , it should produce @xmath124 stable fragments .",
    "if both of the first generation fragments are unstable , they can produce @xmath125 and @xmath126 fragments , respectively , subject to the constraint @xmath127 .",

    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath161 for the case of @xmath163 is _ not _ affected by realizations with two final fragments , and this explains the singularity at @xmath160 .",

    "the existence of these infinitely many singularities shows that analytical determination of the distribution @xmath149 is hardly possible .",

    "( [ qy ] ) corresponds to the case where two ( one ) of the first generation fragments are stable .",
    "the third convolution term describes the alternative case when both of the first generation fragments are unstable .",
    "note that in addition to the recursive nature of the process , we have employed extensivity , i.e. , @xmath171 , in an interval of length @xmath5 .    in order to study the small-@xmath92 behavior of the distribution",

    "we argue that @xmath178 with @xmath179 . assuming that @xmath180 , the above stretched exponential form of @xmath177 shows that the product @xmath181 r_\\alpha\\left[\\lambda ( 1-l)^\\alpha\\right]$ ] would reach a maximum that greatly exceeds @xmath177 at @xmath182 , in contradiction with eq .",

    "the corresponding power - law exponents can be tuned by varying the fragmentation probability , and the entire range allowed by mass conservation may be realized .",
