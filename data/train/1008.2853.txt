    "entropy is one of the cornerstones of statistical mechanics , and is used extensively in many studies .",
    "apart from the usual gibbs - shannon entropy , there is a growing consensus that for an understanding of complex systems , it would be useful to go beyond the shannon entropy .",
    "for this reason , the tsallis @xcite and rnyi entropies @xcite , have been used extensively . on the other hand ,",
    "an elegant geometrical formulation of thermodynamics has been developed , see @xcite for a review . in this , the theory of thermodynamic fluctuations is developed from a macroscopic perspective , making use of the notions of covariance and consistency , expressed naturally using the language of riemannian geometry .    motivated by a need to understand complex systems , we make a study of the intrinsic riemannian geometry associated with the usual gibbs - shannon as well as the rnyi and tsallis entropies .",
    "in addition , we also study the abe @xcite and the so called structural @xcite entropies .",
    "this provides a geometric insight into the systems , studied using these entropies .",
    "thus , for example , the components of the covariant metric tensor , of the underlying riemannian geometry of the thermodynamic phase space , provides insight into the local correlations inherent in the system , which could be used to study its local stability . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic scalar curvature is a signature of the global correlations present , and could be used to address issues related to phase transitions , in the system .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we make a brief review of thermodynamic geometry .",
    "thermodynamic geometry is applied in section iii , to a study of various entropies , for few particle systems .",
    "the entropies studied are the shannon entropy , as well as the rnyi , tsallis , abe and structural entropies .",
    "this is followed up in section iv , by a geometrical interpretation of the additivity of rnyi and pseudo - additivity of tsallis entropies .",
    "finally , in section v , we make our conclusions .",
    "this section provides a brief account of ruppeiner geometry , which as an intrinsic riemannian manifold @xmath0 , serves the purpose of describing the nature of statistical fluctuations in an open thermodynamic configuration . before focussing our attention on a specific configuration , it is worthwhile reviewing some of the basics of intrinsic riemannian geometry .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite for black holes in general relativity , @xcite for a recent account of these notions in string theory and m - theory and @xcite for associated chemical correlations and quark number susceptibilities in @xmath1- and @xmath2-flavor hot qcd configurations .    in what follows",
    ", we shall consider an intrinsic riemannian geometric model whose covariant metric tensor may be defined as the hessian matrix of the entropy with respect to an arbitrary number of parameters characterizing the thermodynamics of the system of interest .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the parameters , such as fixed volume , characterizing the thermodynamics of the equilibrium configuration .",
    "in particular , let us define a representation @xmath3 for a given entropy , generalized temperature , and probabilities @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the probability that a given event @xmath6 has occurred , and would be determined , for an equilibrium distribution , by its temperature .",
    "these @xmath5 s , for @xmath7 , when treated as a set of extensive thermodynamic variables , form coordinate charts for the corresponding intrinsic manifold . also , an appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath8 , characterizes the entropy of the system .",
    "the probability distribution of thermodynamic fluctuations , in an equilibrium intrinsic space , naturally characterizes the invariant interval of the corresponding thermodynamic geometry .",
    "it can be shown that the probability distribution in the gaussian approximation is @xmath9 where the pre - factor @xmath10 is the normalization constant and @xmath11 signifies symmetric product of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the associated inverse metric may thus be shown to be the second moment of the quadratic fluctuations or the pair correlation functions .",
    "an explicit evaluation shows the components of the inverse metric tensor to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 s are the extensive thermodynamic variables conjugate to the intensive variables @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , such riemannian structures may as well be expressed in terms of any suitable thermodynamic potential obtained by legendre transform(s ) , which in our intrinsic geometric set - up corresponds to certain general coordinate transformations on the equilibrium statistical configuration .",
    "we shall apply the above formalism , in this work , to a fixed number of particles .",
    "this method , in general , implies that the quadratic fluctuations in an underlying statistical system may be described by the formalism of intrinsic riemannian geometry , which is solely based on nothing other than the relative probabilities and generalized temperature .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the space spanned by the @xmath15 parameters of the system under consideration exhibits a n - dimensional intrinsic riemannian manifold @xmath16 , the so called thermodynamic geometry @xcite .",
    "the components of the covariant metric tensor may be defined as @xmath17 where the vector @xmath18 .",
    "explicitly , for the case of two dimensional intrinsic geometry parametrized by @xmath19 , the components of the thermodynamic metric tensor are given by + @xmath20 where , @xmath21 .",
    "in this case the determinant of the metric tensor may be expressed as , @xmath22 the christoffel connection @xmath23 , riemann curvature tensor @xmath24 , ricci tensor @xmath25 and scalar curvature @xmath26 for the two dimensional thermodynamic geometry @xmath27 can be computed .",
    "the scalar curvature can be shown to be @xmath28 interestingly , the relation between the thermodynamic scalar curvature and the riemann curvature tensor for the two dimensional intrinsic geometry is given ( see for details @xcite ) by @xmath29 one may further see that this relation is quite natural for any intrinsic riemannian surface @xmath30 .",
    "multi - parameter statistical configurations can also be studied along similar lines .",
    "physically , it is intriguing to note that the riemannian structure defined by the metric tensor , in the entropy representation , is rather closely related to classical thermodynamic fluctuation theory @xcite and critical phenomena , if any .",
    "even though the above geometric formulation thus tacitly involves a microscopic basis in terms of a chosen ensemble , nevertheless , the present analysis has only been considered in the thermodynamic limit of open statistical systems .",
    "it is worth noting that the relation of a non - zero scalar curvature with an underlying interacting statistical system remains valid for higher dimensional intrinsic manifolds and the connection of a divergent ( scalar ) curvature with phase transitions may as well be analyzed from the hessian matrix of the considered fluctuating entropy .",
    "our analysis thus takes into account scales that are larger than the correlation length where a few microstates can not dominate the entire macroscopic phase - space configuration .",
    "we shall focus on the interpretation that the underlying entropy includes contributions from a large number of microstates and make use of our description of the geometric thermodynamics of open systems . with this general introduction to the thermodynamic geometry defined as the hessian function of the configurational entropy",
    ", we shall now proceed to investigate the thermo - geometric structures of finite particle systems , with few parameters .",
    "we shall compute entropies and study the corresponding thermodynamic geometry .",
    "having provided a brief description of thermodynamic geometry , which gives clear prescription for obtaining the metric tensor @xmath31 and associated ricci scalar curvature @xmath32 , it is worth mentioning that these quantities find relevance in diverse studies , since the scalar curvature represents the correlation length of the chosen statistical configuration @xcite .",
    "this would be important , as we shall show below , in the context of complex statistical systems which are seen to be generically interacting .",
    "what is presented here may be motivated by saying that a system can be described by , say , the two states of a coin , _ viz .",
    "_ , heads @xmath33 or tail @xmath34",
    ". this would be called , in our nomenclature , a two particle system , the classical analog of a two - level quantum system ( qubit ) , having two probabilities , taking values over @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , a three particle system can be described by three probabilities , and would be the classical analog of a three - level system . for an entropic description of complex systems , we shall use the shannon entropy , as a comparison with , among others , tsallis and rnyi entropies @xcite .",
    "we shall consider equilibrium thermodynamic systems , and describe their nature under gaussian fluctuations .",
    "it will be shown that the symmetric nature of fluctuations define an intrinsic riemannian geometry , whose metric tensor may be obtained as the negative hessian of the associated entropy .",
    "the number of concerned parameters of a chosen configuration basically determines the dimensionality of phase - space .      here",
    "we present a brief account of the essential features of thermodynamic geometries from the perspective of multi - parameter shannon configurations .",
    "in particular , we shall focus our attention on the geometric nature of the underlying ensemble having finitely many particles .",
    "the expression for shannon entropy , for arbitrary number of probabilities , is given by @xmath36 below , we shall compute the concerned configurations for an arbitrary @xmath37 and then analyze the generic nature of statistical correlations in them .",
    "the number of probabilities define the dimension of the underlying thermodynamic configuration .",
    "let us first consider the simplest case of shannon configuration with two independent probabilities @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", the entropy may be expressed as @xmath39 the components of the covariant metric tensor are explicitly given by @xmath40 for the two particle shannon configuration , we find that the determinant of the metric tensor is non - zero and varies as inverse of the either of the probabilities . in particular , we finds that the determinant of the metric tensor is @xmath41 furthermore , it is not difficult to see that the scalar curvature vanishes , @xmath42 , and thus the underlying statistical basis is a non - interacting configuration .",
    "an addition of third probability as an intrinsic coordinate to the foregoing configuration shows that the expression of entropy in this case is @xmath43 we may easily observe that the components of the covariant metric tensor are @xmath44 a similar analysis finds non - zero determinant of the metric tensor , which takes the form @xmath45 in this case , again , we find that the scalar curvature identically vanishes , with @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we find that the underlying three particle shannon configurations are well - defined and imply non - interacting statistical system .",
    "we further notice the same conclusions for any finitely many particle shannon statistical system . in general , we see for multi - particle shannon systems that the shannon pair correlation functions are @xmath47 it is worth mentioning that the determinant of the metric tensor is @xmath48 an easy inspection finds , for all @xmath49 , that the corresponding statistical configurations have zero scalar curvature and are non - interacting .",
    "our analysis thus shows that the general shannon configurations are well - defined thermodynamic systems and have an identically vanishing correlation lengths .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall use the essential features of thermodynamic geometry to describe systems using rnyi entropy , with an increasing number of parameters . here , we focus our attention on the geometric nature of the local and global correlations in the neighbourhood of small fluctuations in the chosen rnyi configurations .",
    "as stated earlier , the thermodynamic metric in the probability space is given by the negative hessian matrix of the entropy with respect to the variables defining the space , which here , would be the two , three , ... distinct probabilities carried by the rnyi configurations .",

    "( [ fig22 ] ) , ( [ fig23 ] ) , respectively , bring out the nature of statistical fluctuations at the local as well as global level .     as a function of @xmath99 and q.,width=340 ]     as a function of @xmath99 and q , width=340 ]",
    "in this paper , we have applied thermodynamic geometry to open statistical systems .",
    "the metric tensor , @xmath186 , is an indicator of local correlations in the system and can be used to explore questions related to its local thermodynamic stability , while a non - zero thermodynamic scalar curvature , @xmath32 , is a signature of global correlations in the system and would be useful to address questions related to phase transitions in it .",
    "specifically , a zero scalar curvature would indicate that the components of the statistical system fluctuate independent of each other , while a divergent scalar curvature would be an indicator of phase transitions .",
    "we have analyzed the , well known , gibbs - shannon , rnyi and tsallis entropies . from our motivation to understand complex statistical models , we also study the intrinsic thermodynamic geometry of abe and structural entropy .",
    "similar conclusions are valid , at a qualitative level , for the two and three parameter rnyi configurations , and is depicted in figs .",
    "( [ fig3])-([fig6 ] ) .",
    "the negative scalar curvature is an indicator of the attractive nature of the system , as indicated by the crusts of fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) , for the two particle case .",
    "following fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) , we observe that the three parameter system has larger attraction , as it possesses larger negative valued scalar curvature .    in order to make detailed predictions , we have made an analysis for one , two and three parameter , thermally excited configurations .",
    "we find that the local statistical correlation functions associated with the gibbs - shannon , rnyi , tsallis , abe and the structural configurations are well defined , and diagonal components correspond to definite heat capacity expressions .",
    "we observe that the nature of correlations remain the same , qualitatively , as we increase the number of parameters in either configuration .    for few parameter systems , we find that the intrinsic thermodynamic system has a non - zero scalar curvature .",
    "physically , this shows that the generic rnyi , tsallis , abe and structural configurations correspond to an interacting statistical system . on the other hand , the gibbs - shannon entropy ,",
    "having a zero scalar curvature , corresponds to a non - interacting statistical system .",
    "thus , we are able to give a geometric meaning to the various entropies .",
    "to extend the geometric approach , we may start with the power law hamiltonian with its dependence on a parameter @xmath187 as @xmath188 such hamiltonians are useful in modeling the thermostatistics of complex systems @xcite .",
    "when @xmath189 , this configuration corresponds to the one - dimensional ideal gas with quadratic hamiltonian @xmath190 .",
    "for such models @xcite , the rnyi distribution is given by @xmath191 here @xmath192 .",
    "where @xmath193 is defined as in ( eqn .",
    "[ power ] ) and @xmath194 is the average energy . substituting eq .",
    "( [ rendispower ] ) into the eq .",
    "( [ renyientropy ] ) , the rnyi entropy can be obtained for @xmath195 .    for @xmath196",
    ", we have extensively analyzed the thermodynamic geometric properties for these systems in section iii .",
    "in fact , the generic nature of local and global correlations , arising from the determinant of the metric tensor and scalar curvature , as depicted in the respective plots , possess a very similar nature under an addition of the extra variable @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that we find similar issues to hold in various possible cases of the open statistical configurations with @xmath197 .",
    "the rnyi and shannon entropies @xcite have been investigated further , for similar considerations , for @xmath198 .",
    "the corresponding tsallis , abe and structural entropies , are expected to show similar thermodynamic geometric behavior .",
    "this analysis brings out that the generic open systems have well - defined , interacting statistical configurations .    for a given statistical system with a specific entropic parameter @xmath8 ,",
    "the determinants of the metric tensor and the corresponding scalar curvatures are envisaged to have definite connections with the superstatistics @xcite , where the entropic parameter is defined by physical properties of a complex system , that can exchange energy and heat with a thermostat .",
    "these issues would be the subject of future investigations .",
    "as previously mentioned , the treatment followed in this paper is classical .",
    "it would be pertinent to develop the corresponding geometric treatment in the quantum regime . from this perspective @xcite",
