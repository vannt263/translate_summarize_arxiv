    "one way to determine the ckm matrix element @xmath0 is by exclusively measuring the differential decay width of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 processes as a function of the kinematic variable @xmath3 , the product of the four - velocities of the initial and final mesons .",
    "the latter decay channel has the experimental advantage of a larger branching ratio and less background .",
    "even more profitable is the fact that this decay does not suffer from helicity suppression near @xmath4 , the point where the charmed meson is produced at rest . at this point",
    "the theoretical description is well controlled by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite and @xmath0 can be determined with higher accuracy .",
    "however , measurements of @xmath0 through @xmath1 decays , although more difficult to perform , are also important to check the consistency of the theory .",
    "the differential decay width of the @xmath5 process can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a phase space function and @xmath8 is the form factor describing the @xmath9 transition .",
    "the shape of the form factor can not be predicted by the theory but it can be constrained by using dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "hqet gives the normalization of @xmath8 at zero recoil ( @xmath4 ) , where the @xmath10 and @xmath11 wave functions are completely overlapped , to be unity . taking into account @xmath12 and qcd corrections to the heavy quark limit , the normalization yields  @xcite : @xmath13 if @xmath7 was not zero at @xmath4 , @xmath0 could be directly extracted from the measured differential decay width at this point .",
    "as the phase space vanishes in this region , the differential decay width has to be extrapolated , the quality of the extrapolation depending on the quality of the reconstruction efficiency near to the zero recoil point .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 by reconstructing @xmath14 decays have been performed by aleph  @xcite , delphi [ 5,6 ] and opal  @xcite collaborations from @xmath15 decays , and by cleo  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations , from @xmath16 pairs coming from @xmath17 decays .",
    "when the b meson is coming from a z decay , a large boost is given to the b and to its decay products .",
    "secondary vertices can be better determined than in case of a @xmath17 decay where the two b mesons are produced practically at rest .",
    "on the contrary , the energy of a b coming from a z can not be so well determined as if it was coming from a @xmath17 decay , and the resolution on the @xmath3 variable deteriorates . to measure the @xmath14 differential decay width , leptons and @xmath11 candidates",
    "are selected .",
    "the @xmath11 meson is reconstructed by its decay into a d meson and a soft pion , the latter is produced almost at rest in the @xmath11 rest frame .",
    "the d meson can be reconstructed using several decay channels . in case of experiments working at the z ,",
    "the good vertex separation allows the @xmath11 to be inclusively reconstructed by mainly detecting the soft pion and few particles from the @xmath18 , thus increasing the available statistics .",
    "when the b is produced at rest , the soft pion can not be so well detected and the efficiency for charged pions decreases as @xmath3 goes to 1 .",
    "this does not happen for @xmath19 decays where the soft @xmath20 is identified by its decay into two photons .",
    "the cleo collaboration analyzes this channel in addition to the @xmath21 one .",
    "the most difficult source of background in @xmath22 decays , is due to @xmath11 s coming from excited @xmath23 states .",
    "decay properties of resonant and non - resonant @xmath23 decays are not well established yet and these decays introduce an important uncertainty in the determination of @xmath0 . at the @xmath17 energy ,",
    "kinematic variables such as the cosine between the b and the @xmath24lepton system , which are obtained making use of the missing energy measurement and the beam energy as a constraint , can be used to eliminate @xmath23 decays .",
    "the contamination from @xmath23 is larger at the z energy and it is more difficult to separate .",
    "experiments use topological variables based on vertex separation and charge correlation to identify this source of background .",
    "the shape of the form factor @xmath8 entering in @xmath25 is usually expressed in terms of the form factor slope @xmath26 and of the form factor ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "a parameterization of @xmath8 , constrained by dispersion relations has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 form factor ratios have been measured by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "experiments use these values and fit @xmath25 to extract @xmath29 and the form factor slope @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : belle ] shows the fit of the unfolded distribution of @xmath30 measured by the belle collaboration  @xcite using the form factor of expression given in  @xcite or a linear parameterization .    to    averaging the results of the different experiments , the values of @xmath31 and @xmath26 have been found to be  @xcite :    l f_d^*(1)|v_cb|=(38.80.5(stat)0.9(sys))10 ^ -3 + _",
    "d^*^2=1.490.05(stat)0.14(sys ) .    figure  [ fig : average ] and  [ fig : elipses ] shows the results and the world average of the different analyses , scaled to common inputs . using the value of @xmath32 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f1 ] ) , it yields :    @xmath33 .    to    to      the dominant uncertainty on @xmath0 is coming from theory .",
    "it is expected that lattice computations will improve the accuracy of the @xmath32 value during the next years .",
    "the statistical error will also decrease below 1@xmath34 as soon as babar and belle analyze their total available statistics .",
    "the other systematic uncertainties are coming from different sources .",
    "the most important contribution originates from errors correlated between the different experiments . for @xmath0",
    "these are the measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath36 rates , the @xmath23 contribution and the branching fractions of the d decay channels , whereas for @xmath26 the measurements of @xmath27 and @xmath28 form factor ratios are the dominant error source .",
    "@xmath0 can also be extracted from the differential width :    @xmath38    where , analogously to the @xmath2 case , @xmath39 is a phase space function and @xmath40 is the form factor for the @xmath41 transition .",
    "the experimental difficulty in measuring @xmath0 from this decay is coming from the large @xmath42 contribution , from @xmath43 decays , to the background , especially at @xmath44 , where the @xmath1 decay rate is helicity suppressed .",
    "in addition , up to now , the theoretical control on @xmath45 is weaker than on @xmath46 since the uncertainties coming from lattice computations have not been completely determined .",
    "calculations using sum rules or the quark model find that @xmath45 , unlike @xmath46 which benefits from the luke s theorem  @xcite , is affected by the first order @xmath12 corrections .",
    "averaging the aleph  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and belle  @xcite measurements , gives  @xcite :    l g_d(1)|v_cb|=(42.43.7)10 ^ -3 ;  _ d^2=1.140.16 .",
    "the contribution of each experiment , scaled to common inputs , can be seen in figures [ fig : averaged ] and [ fig : elipsesd ] .    using @xmath47  @xcite ,",
    "it yields :    @xmath48 .    to    to    which",
    "is compatible with the value obtained from @xmath49 decays .",
    "@xmath0 has been exclusively measured by different experiments using @xmath50 and @xmath49 decays .",
    "the averaged value obtained from @xmath49 decays is :    @xmath51    and from @xmath50 :    @xmath48 .",
    "the dominant uncertainty is coming from the theoretical determination of the form factors at zero recoil , @xmath46 and @xmath45 , which are expected to be improved by lattice calculations during the next few years .",
    "the experimental uncertainty is limited by systematics due to input parameters such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 rates , the @xmath23 contribution and the branching fractions of the d decay channels .",
    "these quantities have to be better determined to improve the @xmath0 accuracy measured from exclusive decays .",
