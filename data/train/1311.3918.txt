    "transmitting messages with perfect secrecy using physical layer techniques was first studied in @xcite on a physically degraded discrete memoryless wiretap channel model . later , this work was extended to more general broadcast channel in @xcite and gaussian channel in @xcite , respectively .",
    "wireless transmissions , being broadcast in nature , can be easily eavesdropped and hence require special attention to design modern secure wireless networks .",
    "secrecy rate and capacity of point - to - point multi - antenna wiretap channels have been reported in the literature by several authors , e.g. , @xcite . in the above works , the transceiver operates in half - duplex mode , i.e. , either it transmits or receives at any given time instant .",

    ", we consider the achievable sum secrecy rate in full - duplex wiretap channel in the presence of an eavesdropper and imperfect csi .",
    "the both users participating in full - duplex communication and the eavesdropper are assumed to have single antenna each .",
    "the csi errors in all the links are assumed to be bounded in their respective absolute values .",
    "in addition to a message signal , each user transmits a jamming signal in order to improve the secrecy rates .",
    "the users operate under individual power constraints . for this scenario ,",
    "we obtain the achievable perfect secrecy rate region by maximizing the sum secrecy rate .",
