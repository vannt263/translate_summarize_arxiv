    "in july 2012 , both the atlas and cms collaborations announced the observation of a long - sought new particle with a mass approximately at 126  gev  @xcite . further measurements of the properties of this new particle manifest consistency with the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) within the errors which are not small up to now  @xcite .",
    "it makes the sm much closer to its triumph in explaining electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the sm is fundamentally correct .",
    "there is no theoretical principle to justify the minimal higgs sector with only one higgs doublet in the sm , and many new physics models beyond the sm predict non - minimal higgs sectors .",
    "therefore , it is very important to determine the higgs sector in order to understand the structure of the new physics model by future experiments at the lhc and the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) is one of the simplest extensions of the sm higgs sector , which is useful in both exploring the phenomenology of extended higgs sectors and interpreting experimental results from searches for additional higgs bosons .",
    "some of the new physics models contain two higgs doublets , such as the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )  @xcite , models for extra cp phases , models for electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite , and models for radiative neutrino mass generation mechanism  @xcite . in general",
    ", the extension with additional doublet fields causes flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , which are strongly bounded by experimental data . in order to avoid such dangerous fcncs ,",
    "different quantum number should be assigned to each doublet field  @xcite .",
    "this can be attained by introducing a softly - broken discrete symmetry under which @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two doublet fields . in this case",
    ", there can be four types of yukawa interaction , depending on the assignment of charges of the discrete symmetry  @xcite . in the 2hdms , there are two cp - even neutral scalars @xmath5 and @xmath6 , one cp - odd neutral scalar @xmath7 , and a pair of charged scalars @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the lighter cp - even neutral scalar @xmath5 is the discovered sm - like higgs boson with the mass of about 126  gev .",
    "additional neutral and charged higgs bosons have rich phenomenology and serve as a cornerstone for physics beyond the sm .    in the literature",
    ", there have been many discussions on various types of 2hdms and their signatures at the lhc  @xcite . for a recent systematic study on the theory and phenomenology of 2hdms",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in light of the recent data collected at the lhc 7 - 8  tev run ,",
    "many possibilities for explanation of the current data of several decay channels for the observed higgs boson are explored in the framework of the 2hdms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the parameter regions in the 2hdms have been constrained by direct searches for additional higgs bosons at the lhc  @xcite . for the future run of the lhc with the collision energy of 14  tev",
    ", additional higgs bosons are expected to be detected as long as their masses are smaller than 350  gev to 800  gev , depending on the scenario of the 2hdms for the integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the ilc is a future electron - positron linear collider with the collision energies to be from 250  gev to 1  tev  @xcite .",
    "the ilc can be used for precision measurements of the masses and couplings of the sm particles .",
    "we can expect that the first run of the ilc with the collision energy at 250  gev is capable of measuring the properties of the discovered sm - like higgs boson with a considerable level . by the combination of the results with higher collision energies up to 1  tev",
    ", all the coupling constants with the discovered higgs boson can be measured with excellent accuracies .",
    "for instance , the higgs couplings with weak gauge bosons can be measured by better than 1% , the yukawa coupling constants can be measured by percent levels , and the triple higgs boson coupling can be measured by a ten percent level  @xcite .",
    "such precision measurements of coupling constants of the discovered higgs boson can make it possible to perform fingerprinting of extended higgs sectors when deviations from the sm predictions are detected , because each extended higgs sector predicts a different pattern in deviations of coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "however , the deviations in the coupling constants of the sm - like higgs boson from the sm predictions can be smaller than those detectable at the ilc , even when additional higgs bosons are not too heavy .    at the ilc , the direct searches can also be well performed for new particles in the models beyond the sm as long as kinematically accessible .",
    "additional higgs bosons can be produced mainly in pair if the sum of the masses is less than the collision energy , via @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "for the collision energy below the threshold of the pair production , single production processes of new additional higgs bosons can be used too , although the production cross sections are not large .",
    "the single charged higgs boson production has been studied in the framework of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "preliminary detection possibilities were studied at linear colliders , and their analysis shows that in the parameter space beyond the kinematic limit for pair production , single production of @xmath8 associated with the top quark turns out to be a useful channel in studying the charged higgs boson phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "qcd corrections to the process @xmath12 and its charge conjugate counterpart have been studied in the mssm in ref .",
    "the single production processes of additional neutral higgs bosons have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and qcd corrections to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 processes are calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the discovery potential for additional higgs bosons through single and pair production processes at linear collider are evaluated in the mssm  @xcite , which is useful in distinguishing the mssm from the other models .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a comprehensive analysis on the production and decay processes of additional higgs bosons for all types of yukawa interaction under the discrete symmetry .",
    "the parameter space of discovering additional higgs bosons at the lhc is shown for all types of yukawa interaction in the 2hdm according to the analysis given in ref .",
    "we then examine detailed signatures of additional higgs bosons for all types of yukawa interaction at the ilc .",
    "we find that the complementary study at the lhc and the ilc is useful not only to survey additional higgs bosons at the tev scale , but also to discriminate types of yukawa interaction in the 2hdm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2hdm ] , we introduce the 2hdms and the different types of yukawa interaction . in sec .  [",
    "sec : constraints ] , we present a brief summary of theoretical and experimental ( flavour and collider ) constraints on the additional neutral and charged higgs bosons .",
    "our study on the future prospects of the lhc searches are also presented in this section .",
    "[ sec : ilc ] is devoted to our systematic analysis on the ilc search for the additional higgs bosons .",
    "based on several benchmark scenarios , further discussions on the prospects of the direct searches of additional higgs bosons at future collider experiments are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] . finally , we draw a conclusion in sec .  [",
    "sec : sum ] .",
    "in the 2hdm , two isospin doublet scalar fields , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are introduced with a hypercharge @xmath17 .",
    "the higgs potential in the general 2hdm is given as  @xcite @xmath18 ,   \\label{eq : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are real parameters while @xmath22 , @xmath23 are complex in general .",
    "for the most general 2hdm , the presence of yukawa interactions leads to the fcncs via tree - level higgs - mediated diagrams which is not phenomenologically acceptable . to avoid such fcncs",
    ", we consider 2hdms with discrete @xmath24 symmetry , under which the two doublets are transformed as @xmath25 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "for the sm fermions , four sets of parity assignment under the @xmath24 transformation are possible  @xcite , which is summarized in table  [ tab : z2 ] . because of these types of yukawa interaction , the 2hdm with @xmath24 parity contains a variety of phenomenology with quarks and leptons .",
    ".four possible @xmath24 charge assignments of scalar and fermion fields to forbid tree - level higgs - mediated fcncs  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : benchmark2 ] , the expected signals are summarized for each benchmark scenario with a relatively heavy mass , @xmath26  gev .",
    "first , we discuss the scenario of @xmath27 . at the lhc with 300  fb@xmath0 , while for type - i no signature can be observed , @xmath28 and @xmath29 signatures can be observed for type - ii , and a @xmath30 ( @xmath29 ) signature can be observed for type - x ( type - y ) .",
    "thus , at least the three types ( type - ii , type - x and type - y ) can be discovered and discriminated by checking the pattern of the observed signatures at the lhc with 300  fb@xmath0 . with the 3000  fb@xmath0 data at the lhc",
    ", the situation is not improved , but for type - x , one additional signature @xmath28 would be observed .",
    "therefore , at the lhc with 3000  fb@xmath0 all types of yukawa interaction except type - i can be separated basically . at the ilc with @xmath31  tev , signatures in various modes",
    "can be observed for both the neutral and charged higgs bosons depending on the type of yukawa interaction .",
    "signatures for type - i are expected in @xmath32 and @xmath33 modes .",
    "since the signatures are all different among the four types of yukawa interaction , all the types can also be discriminated at the ilc .",
    "this benchmark scenario demonstrates necessity of the ilc ( 1  tev ) to completely separate the all four types of yukawa interaction .",
    "next , we discuss the scenario of @xmath34 . at the lhc with 300  fb@xmath0 , no signature is discovered for all types of yukawa interaction at all . at the lhc 3000  fb@xmath0",
    ", the signals of type - ii , type - x and type - y can be discovered with different signatures , while type - i can not be seen . at the ilc ,",
    "all types are observed with different signatures .",
    "therefore , the complete discrimination or exclusion needs the ilc in this scenario too .",
    "finally , we discuss the scenario of @xmath35 . at the lhc with 300  fb@xmath0 ,",
    "only the @xmath36 signature is predicted for all types of yukawa interaction",
    ". the situation does not change even with 3000  fb@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the signals for all types of yukawa interaction can be discovered , but the type can not be discriminated at the lhc . at the ilc , @xmath33 signature is observed for the pair and single production of @xmath8 for all types of yukawa interaction . for the neutral higgs bosons , for type - i and type - x only the @xmath32 signature is observed , while @xmath32 and @xmath37 signatures are observed for type - ii and type - y .",
    "therefore , at the ilc , we are able to discriminate the type of yukawa interaction as either type - i or type - x , or either type - ii or type - y .",
    "however , precision measurements of the number of signal events at the ilc could be used for further discrimination .    to summarize",
    ", the additional higgs bosons can be discovered for all the benchmark scenarios by the combination of searches at the lhc and ilc .",
    "furthermore , the type of yukawa interaction can be separated by looking at the pattern of the observed signatures . for the scenarios with ( @xmath38 )",
    "= ( 220  gev , 20 ) , ( 400  gev , 20 ) and ( 400  gev , 7 ) , the ilc is necessary for the complete separation of the type of yukawa interaction . for the scenario with ( @xmath38 ) = ( 400  gev , 2 )",
    ", the lhc can not discriminate the type of yukawa interaction , while at the ilc two groups of the type , type - i or type - x and type - ii or type - y can be separated by looking at the difference of signatures , and further discrimination may be possible by precision measurements of the number of signal events .",
    "therefore , the lhc and the ilc are complementary for additional higgs boson searches and also for discrimination the type of yukawa interaction in the 2hdm .",
    "furthermore , the determination of @xmath39 can be performed through the observation of the branching ratio or the total decay widths of additional higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "we briefly give a comment for the cases with @xmath40  gev and @xmath41  gev . for @xmath42",
    "gev , the current lhc data already have excluded regions of @xmath43 to 9 for type - ii in the @xmath44 search  @xcite and @xmath45 for type - y in the @xmath46 search  @xcite . furthermore , wide parameter regions of @xmath39 with @xmath47  gev have been excluded for type - ii via the @xmath48 search in the decay of top quarks  @xcite . for type - i and type - x ,",
    "the @xmath48 signals may be searched in the pair production process @xmath49 . for type - y with large @xmath39 , @xmath50 decays can be searched in the top quark decay @xmath51 . for @xmath41  gev , the lhc searches can be extended into relatively small and/or large @xmath39 regions . on the other hand , the ilc with @xmath52  tev can not produce additional higgs bosons in pair .",
    "single production processes of additional higgs bosons can enhance the number of the signal to some extent for small or large @xmath39 values .    in our discussion above ,",
    "the sm - like limit , @xmath53 , has been commonly assumed in the benchmark scenarios in tables  [ tab : benchmark1 ] and [ tab : benchmark2 ] .",
    "we here discuss the case in which the sm - like limit is slightly relaxed , i.e. , @xmath54 to 0.99 .",
    "the pattern of branching ratios of additional higgs bosons drastically changes in this case : see for example fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath55 and fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath56 , @xmath6 can decay into weak gauge bosons , whose decay branching ratios can easily be substantially large .",
    "consequently , our discussion above can be changed .",
    "we may expect that the discovery signal of @xmath6 can be clearer in this case because of the decay into weak gauge boson pairs .",
    "the analysis for such a case will be separately performed in the future .",
    "we also note that if @xmath57 is slightly less than unity , the coupling constants of the sm - like higgs boson with the sm particles differ from the sm predictions .",
    "the pattern of the deviations depends on the type of yukawa interactions .",
    "therefore , by detecting the pattern by precision measurements of the coupling constants of the sm - like higgs boson at the ilc , we can fingerprint the specific type of yukawa interaction in the 2hdm  @xcite .",
    "notice that fingerprinting of the model by using the measurement of sm - like higgs boson coupling constants is powerful as long as @xmath57 is less than unity by more than 1% .",
    "if the deviation is much smaller , we can not fingerprint the 2hdm by looking at the sm - like higgs boson coupling constants . in such a case , namely the sm - like limit ,",
    "only the direct searches for the additional higgs bosons at the lhc and the ilc are useful .",
    "finally , we mention the case where our assumption of the common mass for additional higgs bosons is relaxed . in general , masses of additional higgs bosons are given by @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 represent specific combinations of @xmath60 coupling constants .",
    "our assumption is basically reasonable when additional higgs bosons are heavy enough , because their masses are basically given by the unique scale @xmath61 , the scale of soft breaking of the discrete symmetry .",
    "when their masses are around the electroweak scale , they can be varied by the contribution of the term @xmath62 without contradicting the constraints from the rho parameter and also from perturbative unitarity etc . in this case , the signals from neutral higgs boson processes and those from charged higgs boson processes are independent . however , even in such a case , we can repeat the discussion of discrimination of the type of yukawa interaction by using tables  [ tab : benchmark1 ] and [ tab : benchmark2 ] , although the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the direct searches of additional higgs bosons in the general 2hdm with the @xmath24 symmetry imposed to avoid fcncs .",
    "we have considered the possible four types of yukawa interaction which are determined by generic charge assignment of the @xmath24 parity to the sm fermions .",
    "we have discussed the prospect of direct searches for the additional higgs bosons at the lhc , and stressed that the exclusion potential is extensive but not conclusive .",
    "it means that by taking into account the wide parameter space of the general 2hdm , there are possibilities that the lhc can discover only part of the additional higgs bosons or that even the lhc can not discover any additional higgs boson but the ilc can discover .",
    "we have studied the collider signatures of additional higgs boson production by evaluating the production cross sections as well as the decay branching ratios of additional higgs bosons at the ilc for the all types of yukawa interaction .",
    "we find that various signatures can be expected depending on the type of yukawa interaction , the masses of additional higgs bosons and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , as long as the additional higgs bosons are kinematically accessible , their production can be detected at the ilc , and further details around the additional higgs bosons , i.e.  the type of yukawa interaction and the model parameters can be studied .",
    "therefore , the searches at the ilc would be a useful complementary survey even after the lhc results .",

    "<S> we discuss complementarity of discovery reaches of heavier neutral higgs bosons and charged higgs bosons at the lhc and the international linear collider ( ilc ) in two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a comprehensive analysis on their production and decay processes for all types of yukawa interaction under the softly - broken discrete symmetry which is introduced to avoid flavour changing neutral currents , and we investigate parameter spaces of discovering additional higgs bosons at the ilc beyond the lhc reach . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 500  gev run of the ilc with the integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath0 shows an advantage for discovering the additional higgs bosons in the region where the lhc can not discover them with the integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for the 1  tev run of the ilc with the integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath0 , production processes of an additional higgs boson associated with the top quark can be useful as discovery channels in some parameter spaces where the lhc with the integrated luminosity of 3000  fb@xmath0 can not reach . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that the complementary study at the lhc and the ilc is useful not only to survey additional higgs bosons at the tev scale , but also to discriminate types of yukawa interaction in the 2hdm . </S>"
