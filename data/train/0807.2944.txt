    "the comparison is made by matching lattice data with the experimental ones from ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath188 and by obtaining @xmath190 where the first error is from theory while the second from experiment .",
    "this number is in good agreement with our previous determination of the ckm matrix element , @xmath191 , performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by matching @xmath192 , the form factor entering the decay rate of the process @xmath6 , with experimental data at @xmath193 . in both the cases",
    "@xmath3 has been extracted at non vanishing momentum transfer and the corresponding uncertainties are not correlated with the errors on the parameters of the fits needed to extrapolate measured decay rates to zero recoil .",
    "a more direct comparison between lattice and experiment can be obtained by introducing the ratio @xmath189 that does not depend upon @xmath3 . in order to apply a jackknife procedure directly to the ratio of the two form factors ,",
    "we have computed @xmath192 on the same gauge ensambles of @xmath1 by following the finite size scaling recursion described in section  [ sec : ssm ] and by using the definition of @xmath192 discussed in refs .",
    "our results are given in table  [ tab : fw ] and compared with experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the black curves have been drawn by using the two independent fits of the experimental data for @xmath1 and for @xmath192 performed by the heavy flavour averaging group  @xcite by using the parametrizations of ref .",
    "our results , red points in the figure , fall inside the allowed experimental region , i.e. between the two solid black curves .",
    "theoretical errors are smaller than experimental ones that in turn are dominated by the uncertainties on @xmath192 . also from this parameter - free comparison with experiments",
    "we obtain a strong indication for the validity of the quenched approximation for these observables . together with the evidence of mild volume effects (",
    "if we exclude those coming from excited states contributions to correlation functions ) these results may call for a basic short distance nature of the form factors .",
    "this could justify why main unquenching effects are reabsorbed by the renormalization procedure of the quenched calculation that fixes indirectly the renormalized coupling constant from physical quantities .",
    "we warmly thank r. faccini and f. cossutti for providing us the data of figure 6 of ref .",
