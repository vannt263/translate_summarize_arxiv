    "at the end of 1944 , shortly before his death in august 1945 , stefan banach regularly met with andrzej alexiewicz , then a fresh phd from the ( underground at that time ) lvov university . during these meetings",
    ", they discussed a lot of mathematics , and alexiewicz kept a diary whose mathematical part , including questions posed by banach , was published posthumously by alexiewicz s son in @xcite .",
    "the last entry in this diary , dated december 29 , 1944 , reads :    in what follows , the claim and the question from this passage will be referred as `` banach s claim '' and `` banach s question '' .",
    "this seems to be the last question of banach which appeared in the `` literature '' ( broadly interpreted ) .",
    "it is interesting that among all other questions posed by banach  in his papers , in the scottish book @xcite , in other diary entries of @xcite , in the problem sections of _ fundamenta mathematicae _ and _ colloquium mathematicum _ ( the latter being entered posthumously )  this is the only one which does not belong to the field of analysis .",
    "( the only possible exception is question 47 from @xcite about permutations of infinite matrices , which , incidentally , also deals with ( im)possibility of building a certain class of maps from `` simpler '' ones ) . on the other hand ,",
    "that banach was interested in such sort of questions ",
    "belonging , somewhat vaguely , to a crossroad of universal algebra , discrete mathematics , logic , and combinatorics  is , perhaps , not accidental at all , as such a crossroad , along the functional analysis , the main banach s occupation , was another `` polish speciality '' at that time ( and long thereafter ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to discuss ( and answer ) possible interpretations of this question . for the historical context",
    "we refer the reader to a variety of excellent sources : to @xcite for the last years of banach in lvov during two russian and one german occupations ; to duda @xcite , turowicz @xcite , and to introductory chapters of @xcite for the general atmosphere of mathematical lvov ; and to murawski @xcite and woleski @xcite , @xcite for a unique interaction of mathematics and logic in inter - war poland .",
    "there is at least another mention of a variant of banach s question in the literature , namely by jerzy o , a student at the lvov university during 19371939 , in @xcite . there , also with reference to alexiewicz",
    ", o writes :    here by a ternary semigroup one means a set @xmath0 with a ternary map @xmath1 subject to a ternary variant of associativity : @xmath2 for any @xmath3 , and by a reducible ternary semigroup one means a ternary semigroup @xmath4 with multiplication given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an ordinary ( i.e. , binary ) semigroup structure on the same underlying set @xmath0 .",
    "o answers the question in affirmative as a consequence of his general results about extensibility of first - order logical models .",
    "later an alternative and more constructive proof was given by monk and sioson ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the latter paper contains also examples of ternary ( in fact , @xmath7-ary for any positive integer @xmath7 ) semigroups not representable in the form ( [ eq - star ] ) , thus validating this variant of banach s claim .",
    "however , this variant of banach s question is more narrow in scope than those presented in @xcite . can the latter question be interpreted in a different way ? in the absence of additional qualifications , the most general reading is the following : `` multiplication '' on a set @xmath0 means an arbitrary ternary map ( [ eq - f ] ) , without associativity , or any other , for that matter , constraint .",
    "but what does `` generation '' mean ?",
    "virtually all banach s works are devoted to ( proper ) analysis and/or measure theory ( including the famous banach  tarski paradox ) , with , perhaps , only two exceptions : a joint unpublished work with stanisaw mazur on computable analysis ( a constructive approach to analysis ) , and a short paper @xcite , which touches , seemingly , a similar question . there",
    ", banach gives a shorter proof of an earlier result of wacaw sierpiski @xcite :    [ th - un ] for any countable set @xmath8 of unary maps @xmath9 on an infinite set @xmath0 , there are two unary maps @xmath10 ( not necessary belonging to @xmath8 ) , such that any map from @xmath8 is a composition of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this statement is , essentially , about @xmath13-generation of a countable transformation semigroup , and was apparently rediscovered in the literature several times afterwards .",
    "it admits various generalizations to other semigroups and groups , some of them , especially in topological setting ( where `` generation '' is understood up to the closure ) , were pursued by sierpiski and two banach s students , stanisaw ulam ( phd from the lvov polytechnic , 1933 ) , and jzef schreier ( phd from the lvov university , 1934 ; cf .",
    "guran and prytula @xcite for an interesting discussion , and the bestseller @xcite for ulam s account how his joint work with schreier secured him a place in the harvard society of fellows in 1936 ) .",
    "yet theorem [ th - un ] about unary maps proved by sierpiski and banach admits generalizations in another direction  to the multiary maps .",
    "( note the drastic difference between superposition of unary maps , which reduces to a mere composition and hence is associative , and the general case of superposition of multiary maps for which associativity is not even well defined ) .",
    "this may suggest that `` generation '' in banach s question can be interpreted as an arbitrary superposition of maps ( with possible repetition of variables ) . for example , among the ternary maps obtained by superposition of a binary map @xmath11 with itself , are the maps @xmath14 etc .    in this general setting",
    ", however , banach s claim becomes false : any map of an arbitrary ( finite ) arity on any set  in fact , any countable set of such maps  can be generated in this fashion by one binary map ( a multiary analog of theorem [ th - un ] ) .",
    "more precisely :    [ th - webb - los ] for any countable set @xmath8 of multiary maps @xmath15 ( of , possibly , different arities ) on a set @xmath0 , there is a binary map @xmath16 ( again , not necessary belonging to @xmath8 ) such that any map from @xmath8 is a superposition of @xmath11 .",
    "this was proved several times in the literature : for the first time , in @xcite for the case of @xmath0 finite ( the required binary map is a multiary generalization of the sheffer stroke ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath0 infinite , a different , and much shorter proof was presented , again , by o @xcite ( a similar , and yet simpler , proof was rediscovered more than half century later by goldstern @xcite ) .",
    "these proofs , in its turn , are based on an another result of sierpiski @xcite to the effect that any single multiary map on an infinite set can be obtained as a superposition of ( possibly , several ) binary maps .",
    "the latter paper of sierpiski appeared around the same time as banach s question under discussion : the same 1945 issue of _ fundamenta mathematicae _ in which the paper was published , the first one after the 6-year break occurred during wwii , contains an announcement about banach s death .",
    "the same paper contains also another elementary , but interesting for us result :    [ th - tri ] for any binary bijection @xmath17 on a ( necessary infinite ) set @xmath0 , and any ternary map @xmath18 , there is another binary map @xmath19 such that @xmath20 for any @xmath21 .",
    "( the statement readily generalizes to @xmath7-ary maps @xmath11 ) .",
    "the result was , however , not new at that time : it appeared as the solution to the problem 119 , imaginatively entitled `` are there actually functions of @xmath22 variables ? '' , of part 2 in the first 1925 edition of the famous book @xcite .",
    "sierpiski s interest in this topic stems , evidently , from ( a variant of ) hilbert s 13th problem : does there exist a real continuous function in @xmath22 variables which can not be represented as a superposition of real continuous functions in @xmath13 variables ?",
    "see , for example , his earlier paper @xcite where theorem [ th - tri ] is proved for the case where @xmath0 is the set of real numbers ( albeit without using axiom of choice which is necessary in the general case ) , with reference to the ( in)famously , at that time , erroneous paper by bieberbach about hilbert s 13th problem .",
    "ulam , along with mark kac ( phd from the lvov university , 1937 , with banach as a member of examining committee ) , also an active participant of the lvov mathematical scene until the end of 1930s ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , has at least a cursory interest in hilbert s 13th problem as well . in the collection of ulam s problems (",
    "* chapter iv , problem 2 and chapter vi , problem 5 ) , which he positions as a sort of successor to the scottish book , as well in the joint kac s and ulam s popular book @xcite , they note a famous 19561957 negative solution of the hilbert s 13th problem by kolmogorov and arnold :    [ th - kolm - arn ] for any real continuous function in @xmath22 variables @xmath23 \\times [ 0,1 ] \\times [ 0,1 ] \\to \\mathbb r$ ] , there are @xmath24 real continuous functions in @xmath13 variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 for any @xmath28 .",
    "kac and ulam proceed then by formulating various extensions of the problem ( for other classes of functions , for functions acting on more complicated spaces , etc . ) . in @xcite ,",
    "ulam acknowledges banach , among others , for `` the pleasure of past collaboration '' , but it is unclear whether this interest in the circle of questions related to hilbert s 13th problem goes back to the lvov years , and if yes , whether it has something to do with banach s question . at any rate , as was noted on several occasions , `` the iteration and composition of functions '' was one of the main leitmotifs of ulam s work during his life ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of course , there is a very long way from theorems [ th - un][th - tri ] to theorem [ th - kolm - arn ] , but they represent development along the same circle of ideas ( arnold himself used to cite theorem [ th - tri ] as one of the early precursors in his popular expositions of the history of hilbert s 13th problem ) .    the questions whether that or another set of maps generates all maps within a given class , framed in terms of functional completeness of various multivalued propositional calculi ( `` multivalued logics '' , or `` logistics '' , as it was called then ) and the corresponding truth tables , were also popular among polish logicians at that time . in particular , jan ukasiewicz was concerned about functional completeness of his famous @xmath22-valued logic  that is , `` implication '' , the binary map _  _ on the @xmath22-element set @xmath29 given by `` multiplication table '' @xmath30 together with `` negation '' , the unary map @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 and similar systems .",
    "( while ukasiewicz puts emphasis on the philosophical significance of many - valued logics  cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite  most of the questions related to these logics , including question of functional completeness , naturally have a purely formal , mathematical , character ) .",
    "his student jerzy supecki proved in his phd thesis ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) functional incompleteness of the set @xmath33 , and , in the positive direction , established functional completeness of the set @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the unary map sending all @xmath22 elements to @xmath36 :    let @xmath37 be a set of @xmath22 elements .    1 .",
    "there are multiary maps @xmath15 which can not be represented as a superposition of the maps  and @xmath31 .",
    "any multiary map @xmath15 is a superposition of the maps  , @xmath31 , and @xmath35 .",
    "( it is interesting to note that the same 19361937 issue of _ comptes rendus des sances de la socit des sciences et des lettres de varsovie _ in which supecki s paper was published , contains the paper @xcite of donald l. webb , a fresh phd from caltech and the author of the already mentioned @xcite , in which he extends the results of the latter paper .",
    "this , among other things , suggests that developments in this branch of logical calculi on both sides of atlantic did not proceed in isolation at that time - valued logic as one of the four major contributions `` on the nature of truth '' during the last 6000 years ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , so it is , perhaps , not accidental that webb , a young californian , published in a relatively obscure warsaw journal . ] ) .",
    "earlier , another ukasiewicz student , mordchaj wajsberg has reported at the ukasiewicz ",
    "tarski seminar some related results  see a brief description at the very end ( `` anmerkung '' ) of @xcite ( cf . also surma @xcite ) .",
    "in the same paper , more binary maps generating all maps of arbitrary arity on a finite set are presented without proof .",
    "some of the wajsberg s results apparently go back as early as 1927 , i.e. almost a decade before webb .",
    "more logical calculi , both complete and incomplete , were developed around this time , first of all , by emil leon post ( born in poland , otherwise not related to that country ) , as well as by ukasiewicz , supecki , bolesaw sobociski ( another phd student of ukasiewicz ) , eustachy yliski ( professor of the lvov university in 19191941 ) , zygmunt zawirski , and others .",
    "post s purely formal treatment of many - valued logics ( `` a combinatorial scheme '' in the words of mostowski @xcite ) is , perhaps , closer in spirit to mathematical questions considered here than the philosophical attitude of ukasiewicz .",
    "another feature of the work of ukasiewicz s school and polish logicians in general , was the constant quest for minimal , as far as possible , systems of axioms for that or another logical calculus .",
    "minimality was understood both in terms of the number of axioms and their length ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "banach s claim and question resonate well with this line of thought , as they can be phrased as follows : if a certain @xmath22-term operation in an @xmath7-valued logic is not generated by a @xmath13-term one ( alas , as we have seen , this is wrong ) , the next best thing to ask is to extend the @xmath22-term operation so that it will be generated that way .    of course ,",
    "many further results about hilbert s 13th problem , from one side , and functional completeness and incompleteness of various logical calculi , from the other , were obtained afterwards ( cf . , e.g. , the survey by vitushkin @xcite for the former , and the book by lau @xcite for the latter ) , but their discussion will bring us far away from our main topic .",
    "the `` generation '' in the results above is understood in the sense of the theory of clones , i.e. when forming superposition of maps , repeated variables ( and , hence , superpositions of arbitrary length ) are allowed .",
    "( recall that clone is a set of a multiary maps on a fixed set @xmath0 which contains projections on each variable , and is closed with respect to superposition ; cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , banach s claim can not be interpreted in terms of the clone of all maps on the underlying set @xmath0 , as theorem [ th - webb - los ] tells that all the clone , including its ternary fragment , is generated by its binary fragment .",
    "it should be noted that if we assume that @xmath0 possess some additional  topological , analytic , order , etc . ",
    "structure , and consider not the clone of all maps , but the clone of maps on @xmath0 preserving this structure  then theorem [ th - webb - los ] about generation of all the maps by binary ones is no longer true .",
    "some sporadic examples of various degree of sophistication :    1 .",
    "not every real analytic function in @xmath22 variables can be represented as a superposition of analytic functions in two variables ( cf .",
    "@xcite )  a statement made already by hilbert in his original formulation of the 13th problem , whose proof utilizes some counting similar to elementary counting in the case of @xmath0 finite , and also in the case of polynomials over a finite field in example [ ex - gf ] , see below .",
    ".   superpositions of smooth functions in @xmath13 variables satisfy various differential equations , not satisfied by all smooth functions in @xmath22 variables ( cf .",
    "solution of problem 119a , part 2 of @xcite for the relevant calculations ) .",
    "algebraic functions in sufficiently high number of variables can not be represented as superposition of algebraic functions in sufficiently low ( in particular , @xmath13 ) number of variables  a suite of deep results due to v.i .",
    "arnold and his followers , obtained by interpreting cohomology classes of a suitable braid group as obstructions to such representation ( cf .",
    "napolitano @xcite for references ) .",
    "4 .   there is an @xmath38-element poset whose clone of monotone maps can not be generated not only by its binary fragment , but by any finite set of maps ( due to g. tardos , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , as banach is apparently interested in the case of @xmath0 finite , and does not impose on @xmath0 any additional structure , such interpretation seems to be unlikely .",
    "if , however , we will understand the superposition in a more `` operadic - like '' , `` multilinear '' fashion , where each variable occurs only once , the only possible ways to generate the ternary map ( [ eq - f ] ) by a binary one @xmath39 , are : by1 @xmath40 i.e. the same as in the version of the question from the o paper @xcite discussed above , and @xmath41 this is also in line with theorem [ th - tri ] .    of course , any map representable in the form ( [ eq - l ] ) gives rise , via permutation of arguments , to a map representable in the form ( [ eq - r ] ) , and vice versa .",
    "indeed , the equality ( [ eq - r ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a permutation from @xmath45 , the symmetric group in @xmath7 variables .",
    "banach is concerned with the case of `` commutative '' maps , which , by all accounts , are @xmath7-ary maps @xmath11 which are stable under any @xmath46 : @xmath47 ( usually , such maps are called symmetric ) .",
    "as it follows from ( [ eq-12 ] ) , a commutative map @xmath11 is representable in the form ( [ eq - l ] ) if and only if it is representable in the form ( [ eq - r ] ) .    in this sense",
    ", banach s claim becomes true . in the case of a finite set @xmath0 ,",
    "this is obvious from an elementary counting : the number of binary maps is @xmath48 , so the number of ternary maps of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) and ( [ eq - r ] ) is less than @xmath49 ( less , because these maps may coincide for different @xmath50 s ) , while the number of all ternary maps is @xmath51 .    as an aside note",
    ", it seems to be an interesting question to estimate more exactly the number of different maps of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) and ( [ eq - r ] ) on an @xmath7-element set .",
    "a computer count produces the following table , where the second column contains the number of all binary maps on an @xmath7-element set , @xmath52 denotes the number of ternary maps of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) , @xmath53 denotes the number of ternary maps both of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) and ( [ eq - r ] ) , and @xmath54 denotes the number of commutative ternary maps of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) ( which coincides with the number of such maps both of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) and ( [ eq - r ] ) ) ( so , for @xmath55 we have the obvious inequalities @xmath56 ) :    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the given range , @xmath54 turns out to be equal to @xmath57 , the number of commutative ternary maps of the form ( [ eq - l ] ) with _ commutative _ @xmath50 .",
    "we do not know the general formulas for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath57 , and refrain here from making any conjectures , but this seems to be an interesting topic to study further , is available as an ancillary file in the arxiv version of this note . at the time of this writing ,",
    "the @xmath22-term sequences for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are absent in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences . ] .",
    "it is easy to manufacture examples of a ternary map @xmath11 which can not be generated , in the sense of ( [ eq - l ] ) , by any binary operation @xmath50 , thus explicitly confirming banach s claim ( in examples below , the ternary maps are commutative , but they are not representable as superposition , in the sense of ( [ eq - l ] ) , of any binary map , commutative or not )",
