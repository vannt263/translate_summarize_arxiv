    "leonhard euler , the man who created more mathematics than anybody else in history , was also one of the leading figures in the development of elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "in one of his later works on this subject , `` determinatio onerum , quae columnae gestare valent '' ( determination of loads which may be supported by columns ) , submitted to the academy in petersburg in 1776 , euler studies again the following problem . + consider a thin ( metal ) rod of length @xmath1 and circular cross section of radius @xmath2 .",
    "assume that the rod is clamped at both ends and subjected to a compressional force @xmath3 directed along the rod axis ( @xmath4 axis ) .",
    "we denote the deflections of the rod in the transversal @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions as functions of @xmath4 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . for _",

    "( for a textbook derivation of these equations , see @xcite . )",
    "+ the boundary conditions of the clamped rod are @xmath13 and similarly for @xmath14 .",
    "+ clearly , as long as the force @xmath3 is sufficiently small , the rod will be straight ; that is , the only solution of ( [ eq : deflection ] ) and ( [ eq : bcond ] ) will be @xmath15 , and the rod is stable . however , if @xmath3 is increased there will be a critical value @xmath16 , above which the rod is unstable against small perturbations from straightness and will bend ( see fig.[fig : rod ] ) .",
    "[ fig : rod ]    although in general the deflection will be large , equations ( [ eq : deflection ] ) can still be used to find the critical value @xmath16 .",
    "we just have to find out when ( [ eq : deflection ] ) will have a nontrivial solution @xmath7 , satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcond ] ) .",
    "the most general solution of ( [ eq : deflection ] ) for @xmath7 is @xmath17 the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcond ] ) imply two branches of solutions .",
    "one is given by @xmath18 and for the other @xmath19 has to satisfy @xmath20 .",
    "+ the critical value @xmath16 corresponds to the lowest mode with @xmath21 ( no node ) , whence @xmath22 for @xmath21 the deflection ( [ eq : bcsol ] ) can be written as @xmath23    when @xmath3 becomes larger than @xmath16 , the system , when perturbed infinitesimally , jumps to a new ground state in which the u(1 ) symmetry is broken ( the bent rod ) .",
    "this new state is _ degenerate _ , since the rod can be bent in any plane containing the @xmath4 axis .",
    "this is a nice example of the phenomenon of _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ ( ssb ) .",

    "euler has also studied the shapes of bent rods undergoing large deflections .",
    "( this is discussed in @xcite ,  19 . )",
    "i come now to an entirely different chapter .    one of the main contributions of galois was to identify the group concept and to use it to analyse the problem of solvability of polynomial equations by radicals .",
    "this enabled him to find a criterion of solvability which has unsolvability of the general quintic as just one of many corollaries .",
    "galois theory is in many ways the origin of group theory as a tool to analyse symmetries",

    "one of the main results of galois himself , is the following    a polynomial @xmath73 $ ] with splitting field @xmath24 over @xmath28 is solvable by radicals if and only if the galois group @xmath74 is solvable .",
    "( here , @xmath28 can be replaced by any field of characteristic 0 . )",

    "consider , for instance , the equation @xmath80 it is not difficult to show that the galois group of this equation ( i.e. , the galois group @xmath74 , @xmath24 being the splitting field of @xmath81 ) is the permutation group @xmath82 , which is not solvable .",
    "( the latter fact can be proven in a very elementary way . )",

    "this counts those integers among @xmath90 which have no nontrivial common divisors with @xmath83 .",

    "galois work was to sketchy to be understood by his referees , and it was not published in his brief lifetime ( he died after a duel in 1832 , aged 20 ) .",
    "it was later published by liouville in 1846 , after he became convinced that galois proof of his solvability criterion of equations was correct . over the next two decades",
    "the group concept was then assimilated to the point where jordan could write his `` trait@xmath95 des substitutions et des @xmath95quations alg@xmath95brique '' in 1870 .",

    "+ in the 1870s geometry also began to influence group theory .",
    "of great importance was klein s _ erlanger programm _ in 1872 , which emphasized the unifying role of groups in geometry . in those days",

    "for nearly a century it was believed that maclaurin s axially symmetric ellipsoids ( 1742 ) represent the only admissable solutions of the problem of the equilibrium of selfgravitating uniformly rotating homogeneous masses .",
    "+ in 1834 jacobi came up with the surprising announcement : + _ `` one would make a grave mistake if one supposed that the spheroids of revolution are the only admissable figures of equilibrium even under the restrictive assumption of second degree surfaces .",
    "@xmath0 in fact a simple consideration shows that ellipsoids with three unequal axes can very well be figures of equilibrium ; and that one can assume an ellipse of arbitrary shape for the equatorial section and determine the third axes ( which is also the least of the three axes ) and the angular velocity of rotation such that the ellipsoid is a figure of equilibrium . '' _",
    "+ jacobi s surprising discovery can be regarded as an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the group u(1 ) . for small angular momenta",
    "there is only the symmetric solution , but above some bifurcation point there exists also an unsymmetric solution . before saying more about this and the stability issue ,",
    "let me enter a bit into the preceding history , which begins with newton .",
    "+ in the principia , book iii , propositions xviii - xx , newton derives the oblateness of the earth and other planets .",
    "i first give his result .",
    "let @xmath96 be the ellipticity , @xmath97 the total mass , @xmath98 the angular velocity , and @xmath2 the average radius of the planet",
    ". with a beautiful argument ( described below ) newton finds that @xmath99 if the body is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "+ in his derivation , newton imagines a hole of unit cross - section drilled from a point of the equator to the center of the earth and a similar hole from the pole to the center .",
    "both canals are imagined to be filled with water ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "newton studies now the implication of the equilibrium condition : @xmath100        [ fig : canal ]    along the equator the acceleration due to gravity is diluted by the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "newton has shown earlier ( book i , propositions lxxiii and corollary iii , proposition xci ) that both these accelerations , in a homogeneous body , vary from the center linearly with the distance .",
    "therefore , the dilution factor remains constant and is equal to its value , @xmath62 , on the boundary @xmath101 ( here , @xmath102 is used . ) + now , the weight of the equatorial column is equal to @xmath103 ( @xmath104=equatorial radius ) , and the weight of the polar column is @xmath105 ( @xmath106=polar radius ) .",
    "thus eq.([eq : eqcond ] ) gives @xmath107 newton recognizes that this equation is valid for any @xmath108 !",
    "+ using also @xmath109 this gives @xmath110    chandrasekhar explains in his beautiful last book ( @xcite , p. 386 ) , how newton arrived at the relations @xmath111 ( for us it is easier to derive this from the maclaurin solutions . )",
    "+ if this is used in ( [ eq : poleq ] ) , newton s result @xmath112 is obtained .",
    "it was known already in newton s time that for the earth @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , newton concludes that if the earth were homogeneous , it should be oblate with an ellipticity @xmath114 we know that the actual ellipticity of the earth is substantially smaller ( @xmath1151/294 ) .",
    "this is interpreted in terms of the inhomogeneity of the earth .",
    "+ newton s prediction was against the ideas of the cassini school , as is illustrated in the old - time caricature below ( fig.[fig : cassini ] ) .",
    "[ fig : cassini ]    the famous controversy was finally settled by a measurement in 1738 of the arc of the meridian by a french expedition to lapland , led by maupertuis .",
    "this was an exceedingly difficult and tedious enterprise .",
    "+ i. todhunter writes in his `` a history of the mathematical theories of attraction and the figures of the earth '' in 1873 ( reprinted by dover publications , p. 100 ) : + _",
    "`` the success of the arctic expedition may be fairly ascribed in great measure to the skill and energy of maupertuis : and his fame was widely celebrated .",
    "the engravings of the period represent him in the costume of a lapland hercules , having a fur cap over his eyes ; with one hand he holds a club , and with the other he compresses a terrestrial globe .",
    "voltaire , then his friend , congratulated him warmly for having aplati les ples et les cassini. '' _",
    "+ maupertuis report to the paris academy became a bestseller .",
    "a german translation appeared 1741 in zrich .",
    "+ i have to refrain to tell you more about maupertuis , who later became the first president of the prussian academy , founded by frederick the great .",
    "maupertuis was actually an organizer , but not a great scientist .",
    "his end was tragic .",
    "+ after this long digression i come back to jacobi s solution . in fig.4",
    "the moment of inertia , @xmath116 , relative to the rotation axis ( in units of the non - rotational case ) is shown as a function of the angular velocity squared ( in units of @xmath117 , @xmath118=uniform density ) for the maclaurin and the triaxial jacoby solutions .",
    "the latter sequence bifurcates from the axially symmetric family at the point where @xmath119 ( eccentricity @xmath120=0.81267 ) .",

    "he gives a detailed discussion of the interesting history of this subject , to which an impressive list of great mathematicians , from newton to cartan , has contributed over a long period of time .",
    "thermal instabilities often arise when a fluid is heated from below .",
    "a classical example is a horizontal layer of fluid with its lower side hotter than its upper . due to thermal expansion",
    ", the fluid at the bottom will be lighter than at the top . when the temperature difference across the layer is great enough the stabilizing effects of viscosity and thermal conductivity are overcome by the destabilizing buoyancy , and an overturning instability ensues as thermal convection .",
    "+ such a convective instability seems to have been first described by james thomson ( 1882 ) , the elder brother of lord kelvin , but the first quantitative experiments were made by b@xmath126nard ( 1900 ) .",
    "stimulated by these experiments , rayleigh formulated in 1916 the theory of convective instability of a layer of fluid between horizontal planes .",
    "+ starting from the basic hydrodynamic equations ( in the boussinesq approximation ) and the boundary conditions , rayleigh derived the linear equations for normal modes about the equilibrium solution .",
    "he then showed that an instability sets in when the following dimensionless parameter @xmath128 exceeds a certain critical value @xmath129 . here",
    "@xmath130 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath61 the coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid , @xmath131 the magnitude of the vertical temperature gradient of the basic state at rest , @xmath132 the depth of the layer of the fluid , @xmath133 the thermal conductivity and @xmath134 the kinematic viscosity .",

    "b@xmath126nard convection_. most of the motions observed by b@xmath126nard , being in very thin layers with a free surface , were actually driven by variations of the surface tension with temperature and _ not _ by a thermal instability of a light fluid below a heavy one .",
    "this effect of the surface tension becomes , however , unimportant if the thickness of the layer is sufficiently large .",
    "+    [ fig : benard ]    when @xmath2 becomes larger then @xmath129 , the motion of the fluid assumes a stationary , cellular character ( spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry ) .",
    "if the experiment is performed with sufficient care , the cells become equal and often form a regular hexagonal pattern ( see fig.5 ) . as the rayleigh number increases , a series of transitions from one complicated flow to the next more complicated one can be detected .",
    "an understanding of all this is difficult , because nonlinearities become significant .",
    "+ this concludes my sundry of ancient examples on ssb .",
    "before onsager had found his famous exact solution of the 2-dimensional ising model , it was not generally accepted that the rules of statistical mechanics are able to describe phase transitions . as late as 1937 , at the van der waals centenary conference ,",
    "there was lively debate on whether phase transitions are consistent with the formalism of statistical mechanics .",
    "after the debate , kramers suggested that a vote should be taken , on whether the infinite - volume limit could provide the answer .",

    "<S> apart from a few remarks on lattice systems with global or gauge symmetries , most of this talk is devoted to some interesting ancient examples of symmetries and their breakdowns in elasticity theory and hydrodynamics . since galois theory is in many ways the origin of group theory as a tool to analyse ( hidden ) symmetries , a brief review of this profound mathematical theory is also given .    </S>",
    "<S> _ historical and other remarks on hidden symmetries + ( norbert straumann , university of zrich ) _      the organisers have asked me to entertain you in an evening lecture with some historical episodes , related to symmetries and their spontaneous breakdowns , the main theme of this summer school . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed a fascinating subject . </S>",
    "<S> i shall begin with ancient examples , connected with great names , like euler , galois , jacobi , @xmath0 . in a second part of my talk </S>",
    "<S> i would , however , like to add a few non - historical remarks which are relevant for ( lattice ) field theory . </S>",
    "<S> these should be regarded as supplements to the lectures by lochlainn oraifeartaigh , daniel loss , and others .    in one hour </S>",
    "<S> i can not cover the various topics in any depth . to compensate for this , </S>",
    "<S> i shall add a few references to sources which i find interesting and pleasant to read . </S>"
