    "there are also qualitative problems with this regassing argument : first of all , the same logic should apply to planets with very shallow oceans , potentially negating the supercritical circulation hypothesis .",

    "earth s surface reservoir ( indicated by the @xmath129 ) puts it right at the waterworld boundary under these assumptions .    if one accounts for the ability of isostacy and erosion to reshape continents and keep their heads above water , but still neglects the deep - water cycle , one obtains the dashed red line in figure  [ waterworld_boundary ] .",

    "shows the waterworld boundary for our nominal parameter values and @xmath137 . the small difference between the numerical and analytic waterworld boundaries ( solid black and gray lines ,",
    "respectively ) indicates that the piecewise definitions of @xmath138 and @xmath139 do not critically affect our results",

    "there is a single physical root to and therefore a single steady - state solution .",
    "if there is no net pressure dependence to the deep water cycle ( @xmath142 ) , then all planets have the same mantle water content as earth , @xmath143 .    in the presence of a modest stabilizing pressure - dependence ( @xmath144 ) ,",
    "the steady - state mantle water fraction is @xmath145 in the high - gravity limit , the mantle contains the entirety of the planet s water , @xmath146 . in practice",
    "this can not occur for water - rich planets because of the finite water capacity of the mantle ( @xmath147 ) . nonetheless , the higher gravity of super - earths biases the deep water cycle in favor of mantle sequestration .",
    "water inventory and mantle capacity are both proportional to planetary mass , producing a weak mass - dependence to the waterworld boundary .",
    "as noted in  [ water_capacity ] , the amount of water in earth s mantle is poorly constrained .",
    "the gray broken lines in figure  [ waterworld_boundary ] show the analytic waterworld boundary if earth s mantle water content , @xmath67 , is @xmath148 greater ( dashed ) and @xmath148 smaller ( dotted ) than our nominal value .",
    "note that varying @xmath67 in this model is mathematically equivalent to varying any of the water flux parameters in , many of which are uncertain ( e.g. , the subduction efficiency , @xmath27 ) .",
    "varying @xmath67 by two orders of magnitude affects the waterworld boundary for a @xmath85 super - earth by roughly one order of magnitude ; this is the dominant uncertainty in our study .    the maximum water capacity of the mantle , @xmath69 is not well known for high - mass terrestrial planets .",
    "the water storage in earth s mantle is thought to be concentrated in the transition zone ( 410660  km depth ) .",
    "if massive planets can only sequester water in a thin transition zone , then mantle water capacity scales with planetary area rather than mass , or @xmath149 .",
    "the dotted black line in figure  [ waterworld_boundary ] shows the minuscule effect of adopting this scaling .    on the other hand",
    ", the mantle of a super - earth should be primarily in the form of post - perovskite @xcite , which may not have the same water capacity as earth s dominant mantle rock , perovskite .",
    "we try setting @xmath150 and find that the waterworld boundary is unchanged if post - perovskite can hold unlimited water .",
    "finally , the blue lines in figure  [ waterworld_boundary ] show the waterworld boundary for pressure - dependences of @xmath151 ( dashed ) and @xmath144 ( dotted ) .",
    "( in both cases we use @xmath152 in the numerical model . ) the precise strength of the seafloor pressure dependence of the deep water cycle affects the waterworld boundary by less than a factor of two .",
    "our model of the deep water cycle assumes plate tectonics , but it is currently unknown whether super - earths are tectonically active . the increased heat flux of super - earths should produce vigorous mantle convection @xcite , but the increased strength and buoyancy of crust on super - earths may prohibit plate tectonics @xcite .",
    "mantle convection may even exhibit hysteresis , such that planets with identical boundary conditions may or may not have plate tectonics , depending on initial conditions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that surface water is more important than planetary mass for plate tectonics @xcite . in a classic case of chicken - and - egg ,",
    "@xcite argue that a deep water cycle is a necessary , if not sufficient , condition for long - term plate tectonics .",
    "continental crust formation is thought to be an inevitable by - product of plate tectonics in the presence of water @xcite , so super - earths are likely to have large volumes of granitic crust .",
    "in fact , the large volume of continental crust combined with smaller maximal crustal thickness may lead to a planet entirely covered in continental crust .",
    "this does not greatly affect our results , provided that the planet remains tectonically active and that some regions have thicker crust than others ( differences in crustal thickness scale as @xmath153 for the same reason as ocean basin depth ) .",
    "the homogeneity of volatiles in earth s lower mantle is questionable .",
    "the high @xmath23he abundance of ocean islands has been attributed to a poorly - mixed lower mantle @xcite . by extension",
    ", this hypothesis implies that earth s lower mantle may hold much more water than what is inferred for the upper mantle .",
    "@xcite argue , however , that the @xmath23he abundance of the mantle is consistent with homogeneous composition .",
    "if the mantle is not well - mixed , then @xmath8 represents the water fraction of those regions sampled by the mid - ocean ridge melting and affected by subduction of oceanic crust .",
    "indeed , the source of mid - ocean ridge basalts ( morb ) appears to have maintained a constant water mass fraction , @xmath8 , for billions of years , suggesting that subduction of hydrated oceanic crust is depositing water in the morb source region @xcite .",
    "our model of the deep water cycle predicts that many super - earths have exposed continents .",
    "it will eventually be possible to test this hypothesis by observationally determining the surface character of a large number of high - mass terrestrial planets ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "disk - integrated rotational multiband photometry of earth , essentially the changing colors of a pale blue dot , encode information about continents , oceans and clouds @xcite .",
    "such `` single - pixel '' observations have been used to construct coarse longitudinal color maps of earth and mars @xcite , while simulations suggest that photometry spanning an entire planetary orbit could be used to construct a rough 2d color map @xcite .",

    "a priori_.    the bottom line is that a 510  m space telescope equipped with a coronagraph or starshade could produce a coarse surface map of an earth - analog at a distance of 10  pc @xcite .",
    "such low - resolution maps would be sufficient to identify the continents one expects on a tectonicaly active planet . if most super - earths exhibit the bimodal surface character of earth , it will suggest that they experience plate tectonics and a deep water cycle . if , instead , large terrestrial planets were _ all",
    "_ determined to be waterworlds , it would indicate that our hypothesis is wrong .",
    "it has long been suggested that super - earths ought to be waterworlds @xcite .",
    "if one accounts for the first - order effects of gravity on ocean basin depth and water inventory , then a @xmath85 planet is not expected to have exposed continents unless it has a water mass fraction less than @xmath154 , roughly ten times drier than earth ( solid red line in figure  [ waterworld_boundary ] ) .",
    "we have argued , as have others @xcite , that the approximately steady - state water partitioning on earth over geological time suggests a seafloor pressure feedback that regulates the degassing at mid - ocean ridges and/or the serpentinization and subsequent subduction of oceanic crust .",

    "planets with 1% water mass fraction , however , are almost certainly waterworlds but may have a bulk density indistinguishable from truly earth - like planets . given that simulations of water delivery to habitable zone terrestrial planets predict water mass fractions of @xmath157@xmath158 @xcite , we conclude that most tectonically active planets regardless of mass will have both oceans and exposed continents , enabling a silicate weathering thermostat .",
