    "observations of bose - einstein condensation in trapped dilute alkali atoms have opened up both experimental and theoretical challenges to understand the properties of such systems .",
    "the dynamical properties of a single condensate such as its collective excitations in a trap due to a time dependent drive has been one such area of research @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental realisation of simultaneous creation and confinement of bose- einstein condensates ( becs ) in several hyperfine states of a given species of atom @xmath5 has led to investigations on dynamics of two or more overlapping condensates by coupling them with an externally applied laser field . in particular experimental realisation of binary mixtures of two hyperfine states namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath3",
    "has established the following properties of this coupled condensed system @xmath6 .",
    "* these two states have magnetic moments which are same to the first order .",
    "however , due to other small effects such as gravity , the nuclear magnetic moment and nonlinearity in the zeeman shifts , the location of minima for the two states in the trap can be adjusted to be slightly different or exactly coincident . *",
    "spontaneous inter - conversion from one state to the other is not seen due to the large difference in internal energies between these two states .",
    "the hyperfine energy is 6.8 ghz .",
    "this makes the two condensates distinguishable .",
    "these can be selectively imaged by choice of an appropriate laser .",
    "* these condensate states possess a relative quantum phase which can be measured .",
    "this phase evolves with time the rate being proportional to the chemical potential difference between the two condensates . *",
    "an external laser drive couples these two systems and helps to coherently transfer population from one state to the other .",
    "the mixed condensates thus offer an ideal experimental apparatus to look for macroscopic realisations of dynamical effects like standard josephson effects @xmath7 . + theoretical calculations on such josephson like oscillations in these coupled boson josephson junctions ( bjj )",
    "@xmath8 have shown several interesting dynamical effects .",
    "recently however @xmath0 , an experimental observation of an unexpected behaviour of these coupled systems was reported . in the limit of sustained and large field strengths of the external coupling laser , that is when @xmath9 , the rabi frequency , was five to ten times larger than the trap frequency in the vertical direction ,",
    "along which the two condensates sit displaced @xmath10 , the rabi oscillations between the hyperfine states was found to collapse and revive .",
    "this occurred on a time scale which is large compared to the rabi period .",
    "these slow varying modulations of the fast rabi oscillations vanish at zero trap displacement .",
    "it was also seen to vanish when @xmath11 , where @xmath12 = @xmath13 - @xmath14 is the detuning of the external laser frequency ( @xmath14 ) from the transition frequency between the hyper - fine states ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it was shown subsequently in the same paper that this phenomenon was due to a weak coupling between the low lying motional states of the trap .",
    "in particular a simplified two - mode model was suggested . in this two - mode model",
    "the trap ground state and first excited dipole state were coupled and couplings to all higher motional states were neglected .",
    "thus the paper @xmath0 , demonstrates the possibility of quantum state engineering of topological excitations , through the interplay between the internal and motional degrees of freedom of a bec in a top trap .",
    "numerical simulations by solving the gross - pitaeskii ( gp ) equations for the coupled system were carried out in @xmath0 which reproduced the experimental features .    in the present paper",
    ", we derive the essential experimental features analytically , using the density matrix approach .",
    "equations for the fractional population ( @xmath15 ) in the hyperfine states and their relative phase ( @xmath16 ) as a function of time have been obtained .",
    "averaging over the rabi period , these equations represent the slow dynamics of the system .",
    "collapse and revivals of rabi oscillations and their dependence on detuning and trap displacement are seen to match qualitatively with the experimental results described in @xmath0 . a proposal for combining this strongly coupled regime to the weakly coupled josephson regime",
    "is presented and its role in increasing the stability of vortices @xmath17 is also speculated .",
    "the total wave - function of the two - component condensate is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "initially this wave - function just represents the total population ( @xmath19 ) in the ground state @xmath1 .",
    "an external laser drives the transition from this state to the @xmath2 state coherently .",
    "so we can write , @xmath20    these two states are of the form @xmath0 @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the hyperfine ( internal ) states and @xmath24 and @xmath25 refer to the motional ( external ) states and    @xmath26    here @xmath12 is the detuning , @xmath27 is the energy difference between the two trap states , namely the ground state and the first excited dipole state .",
    "this energy difference is held fixed through the derivation , while in actuality they will vary with time .",
    "@xmath28 is the displacement between the two condensates and @xmath29 is the dipole matrix element which couples the ground and excited states of the trap . in this derivation @xmath29",
    "is held fixed at @xmath30 .",
    "the higher couplings are weak and hence neglected . + taking equations ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath32 ) as starting points , we point out that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 individually satisfy the following normalized coupled gross - pitaeskii ( @xmath35 ) equation in the thomas - fermi limit in an isotropic trap .",

    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the @xmath42 wave scattering lengths for the two hyperfine species of the condensates and @xmath43 is the inter - species scattering length .",
    "the various energy terms are given with respect to the trap energy level @xmath44 .",
    "due to a near degeneracy of @xmath40 and @xmath41 scattering lengths in the case of @xmath3 the approximation that they are equal can be safely carried out .",
    "the system is characterized then by a single scattering length @xmath45 and a single @xmath46 = @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 . in deriving these equations , the spatial dependence of the @xmath35 wave - functions",
    "are integrated out ( adiabatic approximation ) with respect to the trap wave - functions , namely @xmath50 and @xmath51 and treated as constants .",
    "this assumes that the specific changes in the shape of the trap wave - function is not playing a major role in the time evolution of the system .",
    "this assumption is an approximation over what is actually experimentally seen @xmath0 since we are only interested in the dynamics of the fractional population of the hyperfine states .",
    "+ we proceed to derive the population fractions and the relative phase differences between the two hyperfine states by noting that @xmath52    by taking appropriate inner products of @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 and substituting for @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the @xmath35 equations , the form given in equations ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath32 ) , the following rate equations for average values of fractional population @xmath55 and relative phase @xmath56 in the two hyperfine states can be derived .",

    "can then be derived .",

    "the equation ( @xmath67 ) has all the essential features which are reported by the experiments and subsequent numerical investigation in @xmath0 .    *",
    "the @xmath55 , remains a constant when @xmath12 goes to zero or when @xmath28 goes to zero .",
    "that is , in the lab frame the fast rabi oscillations remain unmodulated .",
    "* equation ( @xmath67 ) is derived with the implicit assumption that the condensate has a well defined overall phase which can be measured relative to a reference .",
    "a decoupling of @xmath56 and @xmath55 in the time averaged frame over the fast variable occurs as this phase ( both the slow and fast varying part ) averages to zero .",
    "* though the mean - field term does not explicitly enter the expression ( @xmath67 ) , we can see that the amplitude of modulation increases with decreasing @xmath27 - a result which is confirmed by numerical simulations in @xmath0 which predicts a decrease in @xmath27 for enhanced mean - field effects . *",
    "this form of equation ( @xmath67 ) does not give rise to the chaotic behaviour with high values of @xmath28 reported in @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 gives a typical curve for the parameters given .",
    "+ in the paper @xmath68 , a preparation of the vortex mode is presented in this very two - component system . in this contest",
    "it is tempting to think of the following scheme for stabilising such vortices .",
    "starting from the strong coupling regime ( @xmath69 ) , the strength of the external laser field could be gradually decreased over time . at",
    "sometime then , when @xmath70 , the population in a particular state ( which is a combination of motional and internal states ) gets trapped in that state itself , due to macroscopic quantum state trapping ( mqst ) effects @xmath71 , applicable in this regime .",
    "more specifically , if such trapping should occur in the first excited motional state , which could be a vortex state , then there seems to be a tremendous improvement achieved in the stability of the vortex .",
    "a schematic of such a scenario is given in figure 2 .",
    "in this paper we have analytically derived an expression for the rate of change of fractional population of the hyperfine states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath3 in the strong coupling regime using the density matrix approach .",
    "the derivation gives analytical results for population evolution after averaging out the fast dynamical variable namely the rabi period in the problem .",
    "this derivation is based on a two - mode model for the trap states as proposed in @xmath0 .",
    "the main result of our analytical approach is presented in equation ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this equation reproduces most of the essential features of the two - mode model presented in @xmath0 .",
    "also the possibility to increase the stability of vortex state by modulating @xmath9 is also discussed .",
