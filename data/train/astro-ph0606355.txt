    "2002 , abazajian et al . 2003 ) stands out among these surveys because it has already provided uv to near - ir five - color imaging data , and high - quality spectra for over 100,000 galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic galaxy sample is defined by a simple flux limit ( strauss et al . 2002 ) , and will eventually include close to 1,000,000 galaxies .    a number of detailed galaxy studies based on sdss data have already been published .",
    "strateva et al . ( 2001 ) and shimasaku et al . (",

    "( 2004 ) analyzed the sdss spectra of 170,000 galaxies using principal component analysis ( karhunen - love transform ) .",
    "they demonstrated that sdss galaxy spectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra : more than 99% of the galaxies are found on a two - dimensional locus in the space spanned by the ratios of the first three eigencoefficients .",
    "even the most extreme emission - line spectra can be described to within the measurement noise with only 8 eigenspectra .",
    "an efficient _ single - parameter _ classification scheme is proposed , and it suggests three major galaxy classes .",
    "another remarkable result of their analysis is a strong correlation between various spectral lines , encoded in , and readily discernible from the eigenspectra .",
    "it is not yet known what the results of yip et al .",
    "imply for the detailed distribution of galaxies in color space , but it is obvious that a high degree of structure should exist .",
    "also , a strong correlation is expected between colors and various spectroscopic parameters , such as the strength of the @xmath2 line and the 4000    break , that were recently utilized by kauffmann et al .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate whether the intrinsic simplicity of galaxy spectra implied by the results of yip et al .",
    "can be reproduced in rest - frame color - color diagrams , and whether the position of a galaxy in these diagrams is related to parameters discussed by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "we present an analysis of correlations between colors and various spectroscopic diagnostic parameters , including model - dependent estimates of stellar masses and dust content .",
    "we utilize the `` rest - frame '' strmgren photometric system that measures the continuum spectral slope of galaxies in the rest - frame 32005800     wavelength range . in principle , any set of bandpasses could be used to synthesize the colors .",
    "an additional motivation for synthesizing galaxy colors in the rest - frame strmgren photometric system is a suggestion that it is an efficient tool for studying faint cluster galaxies and low surface - brightness objects without performing time - consuming spectral observations ( fiala , rakos & stockton 1986 ) .",
    "the unprecedented number of high - quality sdss spectra can be used to analyze in detail the advantages and limitations of that method , and relate galaxy colors in the strmgren system to parameters commonly measured using sdss data .",
    "we describe the synthesis of rest - frame strmgren magnitudes from sdss spectra in section 2 . in section 3",

    "we demonstrate and study in detail correlations between rest - frame strmgren colors and various diagnostic spectroscopic parameters . in section 5",
    "we correlate the rest - frame strmgren colors with the spectral eigencoefficients . in section 6",
    "we study the properties of the galaxies at sufficiently large redshifts ( @xmath7 ) to have reliable synthesized  magnitudes .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in section 7 .    ) filter transmission curves for the sdss photometric system ( ugriz ) , and for the strmgren photometric system .",
    "the bottom panel emphasizes the 3800 - 7000  region .",
    "the two spectra are typical for blue and red galaxies , and the four labeled emission lines are used to separate star - forming from agn galaxies . the horizontal bar in the top left corner marks the wavelength region used in the analysis by kauffmann et al . ( 2003 ) .",
    "the strmgren _ uvby _ narrow - band ( 200   ) filter system was designed for measuring the temperature , chemical composition and surface gravity of stars , without resorting to spectroscopy ( strmgren 1966 , for a recent compilation of over 100,000 measurements for @xmath663,000 stars see hauck & mermilliod 1998 ) .",
    "the bandpasses bracket the 4000    break and cover three regions in the 3200 - 5800    spectral region , which makes it a powerful tool for investigating stellar populations in star clusters , or composite systems such as galaxies .    the filter system used here ( , , , ; see next section for details ) is a somewhat modified strmgren system , such that the filters are slightly narrower , and the filter response curves are more symmetric , than in the original system ( odell et al .",
    "the system characteristics are ( see fig .",
    "[ fltsplot ] ) :    * the  filter ( @xmath8   ) is shortward from the balmer discontinuity ( @xmath9 break ) , and provides a measure of hot stars due to recent star formation . *",
    "the   filter ( @xmath10   ) extends bluewards from @xmath11 , but redwards from the balmer discontinuity .",
    "this wavelength region is strongly influenced by metal absorption lines , particularly for spectral classes f and m which typically dominate the galaxy light .",
    "the @xmath12 color is a good measure of the @xmath13    break . * the  ( @xmath14   ) and  ( @xmath15   ) filters",
    "extend redwards from 4600  @xmath16 , where the influence of absorption lines is small .",
    "the @xmath17 color is thus a good measure of the temperature color index , practically free of metallicity and surface gravity effects .",
    "for old stellar populations , the  and   color indices presumably serve as age and metallicity indicators .",
    "the rest - frame strmgren photometric system utilizes filters whose bandpasses are redshifted and stretched to correspond to the strmgren bands in the rest - frame .",
    "this method , introduced by fiala , rakos & stockton ( 1986 ) , alleviates the need for @xmath18corrections , and thus allows robust color comparison for galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "for example , rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) studied the color evolution of 17 clusters of galaxies spanning the redshift range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "they demonstrated that the colors of the red population are consistent with passive evolution models for a single stellar population which formed around @xmath21 . on the other hand , the fraction of blue cluster galaxies dramatically increases from @xmath22 at @xmath23 to @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "the rest - frame strmgren photometric system also provides a good method for detecting cluster members , and enables an efficient spectrophotometric classification of galaxies ( rakos , dominis and steindling 2001 ; rakos & schombert 2004 ; and references therein ) .     envelope .",

    "the synthetic strmgren magnitudes are synthesized on the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "an ab magnitude , @xmath26 , in a bandpass @xmath27 , is defined by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the specific flux per unit frequency ( for more details see fukugita et al .",
    "the zero - point ( 48.6 ) is chosen such that an object with a specific flux of 3631 jy has @xmath30",
    "( i.e. an object with @xmath29=const . has an ab magnitude equal to the johnson @xmath31 magnitude at all wavelengths ) .",
    "the function @xmath27 includes the response of the detector , the transmissivity of the filter , the telescope , and the atmosphere of the earth at some representative air - mass .",
    "it is convenient to express the above equation in terms of the specific flux per unit wavelength ( the form used to report sdss spectra , stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) as    @xmath32    where we introduced a quantity , hereafter called the _ normalized filter _ :    @xmath33    computing _ m _ is , therefore , reduced to a simple integral of the sdss spectrum ( with the spectrum given in 10@xmath34 erg / cm@xmath1/s /  , and @xmath36 in  ) with a _ pre - computed _ normalized filter .",

    "sdss spectra are obtained using a plate with 640 spectroscopic fibers ( diameter 3 \" , corresponding to 6 kpc at the redshift of 0.1 ) , which are fed to two independently calibrated spectrographs ( schlegel et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "spectra are corrected for the galactic interstellar dust reddening during calibration . as shown by vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the accuracy of synthesized magnitudes for point sources can be improved by requiring that the mean offset between the imaging ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and synthesized magnitudes is zero for each spectrograph ( this information is not available when calibrating spectra ) .",
    "we confirmed their result for point sources , and found that it also improves the synthesized photometry for galaxies ( as inferred from the width of the galaxy color locus , discussed below ) .",
    "the synthesized photometry for galaxies can be further improved by using galaxies ( instead of point sources ) to correct for the mean offsets between the imaging ( we use model magnitudes , see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for details ) and synthesized magnitudes .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the latter method . when correcting synthesized strmgren magnitudes , we linearly interpolate ( as a function of wavelength ) the @xmath37 and @xmath38 band corrections .",

    "the accuracy of synthesized magnitudes ( relative to imaging magnitudes , which are accurate to 0.02  mag , ivezi et al .",
    "2003 ) for a subsample of stars is summarized in fig .",
    "[ dmstars ] .",
    "the colors are reproduced with the expected accuracy ( 0.08  mag ) , while there are systematic errors in the overall magnitude scale at the level of 0.10  mag ( root - mean - square scatter ) .",
    "these results are in agreement with vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "[ dmgalaxies ] summarizes the obtained accuracy for galaxies .",
    "again , the colors are reproduced with the expected accuracy , while systematic errors in the overall magnitude scale are 0.2  mag .",
    "note that using galaxies ( instead of point sources ) to correct for the offset between imaging and synthesized magnitudes introduces a systematic trend in the @xmath40 distribution at the faint magnitude end .",
    "nonetheless , as evident from the top and bottom panels , this does not significantly affect the synthetic colors as the overall trend nearly cancels out .",
    "in addition , the distribution of color - differences normalized by the expected errors ( last column in fig .",
    "[ dmgalaxies ] , top and bottom panels ) shows that the errors are estimated correctly ( the width of the distributions is 1 ) .",
    "therefore , we do not expect this to affect the synthetic photometry significantly .",
    "the errors in rest - frame strmgren colors are expected to be smaller than in @xmath41 and @xmath4 colors because the relevant wavelength range is shorter ( and thus less sensitive to large - scale errors in the spectrophotometric calibration of sdss spectra ) .",
    "we estimated errors in @xmath42 and @xmath17 colors by comparing measurements for 1253 galaxies observed twice : the scatter ( root - mean - square determined from the interquartile range ) for the @xmath42 color is 0.09  mag , and for @xmath17 color 0.05  mag .",
    "we tested for plate - to - plate systematics by analyzing the position of the red peak in the color distribution of galaxies ( see the next section ) .",
    "this position shows a scatter of @xmath43  mag for @xmath42 color , and @xmath44  mag for @xmath17 color .",

    "this is the first time that rest - frame optical colors with an accuracy of @xmath450.1  mag are available for a sample of 100,000 galaxies .",

    "the distribution of 99,088 galaxies in the rest - frame strmgren color - color diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ galcorr ] .",
    "the distribution resembles a remarkably narrow locus . to quantify its width",
    ", we define a set of principal axes ( @xmath46 ) where @xmath47 measures the position along the locus , and @xmath48 perpendicular to it .",
    "since the locus is not perfectly straight , we separately fit the blue ( @xmath49 ) and red ( @xmath50 ) ends .",
    "as the boundary between the two ( @xmath46 ) definitions we choose @xmath51 , where the two fits intersect .",

    "the coefficients are normalized such that the errors in @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the same as the errors in @xmath42 and @xmath17 , in the limit when the latter two are the same .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath48 axis is nearly parallel to the color index @xmath54 , used as a metallicity estimator for single stars ( e.g. twarog 1980 ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 colors are shown in fig .",

    "the width of the locus in the p2 direction is surprisingly small and @xmath17 errors . ]",
    "( 0.03  mag , and 0.32  mag in the p1 direction ) .",
    "indeed , the rest - frame colors for a large number of galaxies have not been measured to date with such an accuracy .",
    "this small value both testifies that the errors in synthesized colors are small , and that _ the slope of galaxy spectra in the 40005800    wavelength range is a nearly one - parameter family_.      sdss spectra are obtained with a fixed 3 arcsec diameter fiber positioned as close as possible to the center of the galaxy . since the fiber aperture may not include the entire galaxy , it is possible that colors derived from sdss spectra are biased red by the bulge contribution .",
    "this bias should be the largest for intermediate- and late - type galaxies where the fiber aperture may miss a significant fraction of the outer disk and its star formation . while this effect was discussed in detail elsewhere ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a and kewley et al . 2005 ) , here we explore its impact on the p1 and p2 colors .",
    "the fiber aperture effect will tend to make the p1 color redder for galaxies with large angular size because bulges are generally redder than disks .",
    "the expected effect for the p2 color is not so obvious .",
    "we argue below ( see section  [ irassec ] ) that the p2 color is related to dust , and if this is true , the expected effect is for the p2 color to become bluer for galaxies with large angular size .    figures  [ apeffp1 ]  and  [ apeffp2 ] show the dependence of the p1 and p2 colors on the petrosian 50% radius in the @xmath55 band for galaxies with the @xmath38 band absolute magnitudes in the range -19 to -18 .",
    "this magnitude slice is selected because it is dominated by blue galaxies where the expected effect is the strongest ( see fig .  [ mrp1 ] ) . as the petrosian radius increases , the bulge contribution to the flux captured by the fiber also increases . as evident , small but measurable dependence of the p1 color on the petrosian radius is indeed present .",
    "given the observed range of the petrosian radius , the expected bias in the p1 color is @xmath560.05  mag , with the root - mean - square scatter contribution to the p1 measurement error of @xmath60.02  mag .",
    "compared to the observed p1 range , this is a small effect .",

    "note the different scales for the two colors .",
    "the histograms on the y axes show the observed color distributions . ]    the principal axes ( p1,p2 ) are defined by the _ observed _ morphology of the distribution of galaxies in the rest - frame strmgren color - color diagram . here",
    "we relate these axes to the stellar age and metallicity using the bruzual  & charlot ( 1993 , 2003 ) population synthesis models .    using the same method as for observed spectra",
    ", we synthesize rest - frame strmgren colors from model spectra .",
    "[ bcmodels ] shows the model colors as a function of the age of a single stellar population , and for three representative metalicities .",
    "a single stellar population corresponds to a single epoch of star formation , while real galaxies likely have more complex star formation histories .",
    "in addition , for single stellar population models the star - formation rate history , which is an important discriminating parameter ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ) , is unavailable . nevertheless , the color range spanned by a single stellar population provides a robust constraint on the possible color distribution for any star formation history ( because it brackets the possible color range ) .",
    "the observed range of the @xmath47 color can be explained by stellar populations with ages from 100 myr to 10  gyr .",
    "note that @xmath57 corresponds to populations older than 1  gyr , but the age estimate is very uncertain due to the unknown metallicity .",
    "models provide a simple explanation for the observed small locus width : the @xmath48 color is a color projection which is nearly independent of both age _ and _ metallicity color , while much less sensitive to metallicity than the @xmath47 color , does become redder with increasing metallicity for populations older than 1 gyr .",
    "however , the effect is exceedingly small ( 0.03 mag per dex ) . for individual stars (",
    "@xmath48 is nearly parallel to @xmath58 , c.f .",
    "section [ gallocus ] ) this is large enough because their effective temperature is typically constrained much better than the star - formation history of a galaxy . ] . at any age ,",
    "@xmath59 to within 0.02 - 0.03 mag , and for populations older than 1  gyr , @xmath60 to within 0.01  mag .",
    "that is , whatever is age or metallicity , @xmath48 is always 0 to within a few hundreths of a magnitude .",
    "this is very different from @xmath47 which varies by 2 magnitudes as a function of age , and up to 0.6 mag as a function of metallicity . _",
    "the ability of models to explain the mean value and the very narrow distribution of the @xmath48 color is a considerable success because the principal axes @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined solely by the morphology of the data distribution in the @xmath17 vs. @xmath42 color - color diagram . _",
    "the observed width of the @xmath48 distribution is wider ( 0.03  mag ) than the model prediction ( 0.01  mag ) . while this difference could be easily attributed to the measurement scatter or to the simplicity of the models , we find that the @xmath48 color is correlated with the estimate of the galaxy dust content , @xmath61 ( the effective dust extinction in the sdss @xmath55 band ) , determined by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and further discussed in section [ kauffsec ] .",
    "hence , the larger scatter observed in the @xmath48 color than predicted by the model is , at least partially , due to dust reddening ( which is not included in the models ) .",
    "it could be argued that the @xmath62 correlation is simply due to the fact that both quantities are determined from sdss spectra .",
    "however , they are determined using _ different _ , barely overlapping , spectral ranges . while kauffmann et al .",
    "analysis utilized the 38504160    spectral range to constrain their models ( and then compared imaging @xmath41 and @xmath4 colors to model - predicted colors to estimate dust reddening ) , @xmath48 is determined from the 40005800     wavelength range ( see the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fltsplot ] ) .",
    "another reasonable objection is that the @xmath61 estimates are , of course , model dependent and consequently may not be a good measure of the dust content .",
    "however , obri et al . ( 2006 ) demonstrate that galaxies detected by iras have systematically higher values of @xmath61 .",
    "this finding strongly suggests that @xmath61 does provide an estimate of the dust content .",
    "since the @xmath62 correlation implies that @xmath48 is also a measure of the galaxy dust content , galaxies detected by iras should have systematically higher values of @xmath48 .",

    "[ galcorr ] because the locus is curved .",
    "hence , the @xmath48 distribution slightly changes along the locus .",
    "since iras - detected galaxies are biased towards blue galaxies , it could be that the difference in @xmath48 distributions for iras - detected and all sdss galaxies shown in fig .",
    "[ p1p2hist ] is caused by the variation of the @xmath48 distribution along the locus .",

    "the shift of the @xmath48 distributions between sdss - iras and all sdss galaxies is about the same as the @xmath48 distribution width , so @xmath48 is a rather noisy measurement of the dust content .",

    "this narrow - band photometric system is well suited for studying galaxy colors in the 40005800    wavelength range .",
    "galaxies form a narrow locus in the rest - frame strmgren @xmath17 vs. @xmath42 color - color diagram , with a width of only 0.03  mag . this small width , in addition to demonstrating that the errors in synthesized colors are small , shows that the slope of galaxy spectra in the 32005800    wavelength range is practically a one - parameter family .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the details of the employed photometric system .    using the bruzual  & charlot population synthesis models , we find that the dependence on age and metallicity is _ fully absorbed _ in the first principal color axis , @xmath47 .",
    "this color is essentially a measure of the hubble type ( in sense of early vs. late type galaxies , rather than detailed morphological classification ) .",
    "it is not possible to break the age - metallicity degeneracy with any of the observables discussed here .",
    "this may not be possible even when using standard methods such as lick indices , at least in the case of elliptical galaxies ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2003 ) . as demonstrated by eisenstein et al .",
    ", the strengths of numerous metal lines , such as mg b , can be accurately predicted from the strength of the @xmath2 line ( see their fig .",
    "5 ) ; hence , no additional information can be extracted from the measurements of those lines . on the other hand , tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) report a very tight mass - metallicity relation ( 0.1 dex scatter in metallicity at a given mass ) for 50,000 sdss star - forming galaxies .",
    "thus , it may be that age and metallicity are strongly correlated , too , which then would provide a trivial solution to the problem of breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "indeed , such a relation has been claimed for disk stars in our galaxy ( twarog 1980 ; however , see also feltzing , holmberg & hurley 2001 ) .    the second principal color axis , @xmath48 , is independent of stellar age and metallicity , at least according to the bruzual  & charlot models .",
    "we stress that the definition of this color is purely _ observational _ , and the models explain both its value and narrow distribution width . the @xmath48 distribution width ( 0.03  mag )",
    "measured using sdss data is smaller than typical observational errors in rest - frame colors using other data available to date ( @xmath1180.05  mag ) .",
    "the @xmath48 color appears most sensitive to the galaxy dust content , as demonstrated by the analysis of model - dependent estimates of the dust content by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , and also by the redder @xmath48 colors for galaxies detected by the iras survey .",
    "of course , @xmath48 could be _ indirectly _ related to metallicity , if the dust content depends on metallicity ( that is , the observed @xmath48 color could be correlated with metallicity as a result of radiative transfer through interstellar dust , rather than due to the dependence of the source function on metallicity ) .",
    "the principal colors are well correlated with numerous other spectral parameters determined from bluer and redder spectral ranges , as well as with the position of a galaxy in the bpt diagram constructed with emission - line strength ratios .",
    "these good correlations suggest that not only are the overall uv - ir seds a nearly one - parameter family , but that the same parameter also controls the properties of emission lines .",
    "most notably , there is a good correspondence between the stellar mass - to - light ratio estimates by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and the principal color @xmath47 .",
    "the low dimensionality of galaxy spectra implied by the numerous correlations among the continuum and spectral parameters shown here is in good agreement with the conclusions by yip et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who applied the principal component analysis to sdss galaxy spectra .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in a detailed study of elliptical galaxies by eisenstein et al .",
    "these conclusions are valid for the overwhelming majority of all galaxies ; however , we emphasize that the analysis presented here is based on low - order statistical moments ( such as root - mean - square scatter ) and can not rule out a possibility that as many as 5 - 10% of galaxies behave differently .",
    "our results support the suggestion by rakos and collaborators ( fiala , rakos & stockton 1986 ) that the rest - frame strmgren photometry provides an efficient tool for studying faint cluster galaxies and low surface brightness objects , without the need for time - consuming spectroscopy .",
    "for example , the stellar mass - to - light ratio can be determined from @xmath47 with an rms scatter of only 0.10 . since the brightest cluster galaxies can be selected from sdss data to redshifts of 0.8 ( e.g. ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ) , this method can be used to quantify the rise in star formation activity with cosmic epoch , and the butcher - oemler effect , with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "we are currently undertaking such an observational program .",
