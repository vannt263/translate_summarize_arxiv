    "the temperature dependence of the spin @xmath0 value of electrons in gaas has been a subject of controversy since 1995 , when it was shown that the experimental data , exhibiting an increase of the value of @xmath0 as a function of temperature , are in a qualitative disagreement with the * k@xmath1p *   theory , if one takes into account an experimental change of the fundamental energy gap [ 1 ] . the seeming qualitative disagreement between the experiment and the theory",
    "was confirmed by subsequent publications [ 2 , 3 ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spin properties of electrons in gaas is not only of academic interest since for possible spintronic applications the behavior of @xmath0 near room temperature is clearly of great importance .",
    "it was recently shown that one can reach at least a qualitatively correct description of the experimental @xmath0 values if one includes in the * k@xmath1p *   theory not the complete temperature change of the fundamental energy gap but the change due to lattice dilatation alone [ 4 ] .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the @xmath0 value of electrons in insb indicating that the better description was not fortuitous .",
    "the experiments [ 1 - 3 ] and their analysis presented in ref . [ 4 ] have two shortcomings . on the experimental side ,",
    "the @xmath0 value data was obtained by time - resolved photoluminescence alone , while it would be desirable to verify these data by some other method . on the theoretical side , the analysis in ref . [ 4 ] is somewhat tentative as it does not account for the fact that at higher temperatures electrons populate many landau levels , so that the measured spin @xmath0 value represents an average over many transitions .",
    "recognizing the importance of the subject and its controversial character the present work tries to overcome the above shortcomings in both experimental and theoretical aspects .",
    "first , we present new data on the temperature dependence of the electron @xmath0 value in gaas obtained with the time - resolved faraday rotation and compare them with the photoluminescence data of refs . [",
    "second , we complete the theoretical description by including the electron statistics which results in the necessity of summation over many landau levels ( lls ) . we show that the complete theory considerably improves the description of experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe new experiments on the temperature dependence of the electron @xmath0 value in gaas .",
    "next , we describe the theoretical procedure used to evaluate the temperature dependence of the @xmath0 value and compare the theory with all existing experimental data .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude the paper by a summary .",
    "the spin @xmath0 factor of electrons in a nominally undoped 30 @xmath2 m thick layer of gaas was determined using an ultrafast degenerate setup for measuring the time - resolved faraday rotation [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "spin polarized electrons were optically excited by a circularly polarized pump pulse which was spectrally tuned to the band gap of gaas at all temperatures .",
    "after the excitation the electron spins begin to precess in a magnetic field applied parallel to the sample surface in the voigt geometry . by measuring the faraday rotation of a linearly polarized probe beam transmitted through the sample one",
    "is able to monitor the electron spin dynamics .",
    "the larmor spin precession results in an oscillating signal that decays exponentially at a rate 1/@xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the ensemble spin dephasing time ( fig .",
    "the @xmath0 factor is determined using the equation of larmor precession : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the measured larmor precession frequency , @xmath6 is the bohr magnetron , and @xmath7 is the applied magnetic field . the ultrafast femtosecond laser pulses ( @xmath8 = 15.5 nm , @xmath9 = 10 mw , @xmath10 = 1mw ) were generated by a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser oscillator operating at 76 mhz repetition frequency .",
    "the samples were held at low temperatures using an optical cryostat and a magnetic field was generated by a split - coil superconducting magnet .",
    "magnetic fields up to 6 t have been applied .",
    "gaas is a medium - gap material , so that a three - level * k@xmath1p *   description , successfully used for narrow gap semiconductors [ 8 , 9 ] , is not adequate for treating its band structure .",
    "the reason is that in gaas the fundamental gap @xmath11 between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels is about 1.5 ev , i.e. it is not much smaller than the gap @xmath14 between the @xmath12 level and the upper @xmath15 conduction level ( which is about 3 ev ) .",
    "it has been convincingly demonstrated that an adequate way to treat the conduction band of gaas is to use a five - level model ( 5lm , which is equivalent to 14 bands including spin ) in the * k@xmath1p *   description ( see refs . [ 10 , 11 ] and the references therein ) . in particular , for the description of electron spin @xmath0 value in gaas - based heterostructures the usefulness of the 5lm was demonstrated quite recently [ 12 ] .",
    "since the 5lm for electrons in the presence of a magnetic field and its use for magnetooptical properties of gaas was described in some details before [ 10 , 11 ] , we only mention here the main elements of this approach .",
    "thus the model includes exactly the @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 levels at the center of the brillouin zone and the resulting * k@xmath1p *   matrix has dimensions 14 @xmath18 14 .",
    "there exist three nonvanishing interband matrix elements of momentum : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and one interband element of the spin - orbit interaction @xmath22 . if one takes q = 0 and @xmath23 = 0 ( where @xmath23 is the momentum along the magnetic field direction ) the 14 @xmath18 14 initial matrix factorizes into two 7 @xmath18 7 matrices for the spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "these matrices are soluble with the envelope functions in the form of harmonic oscillator functions and the eigenenergy problem for different landau levels ( lls ) @xmath24 reduces to a diagonalization of 7 @xmath18 7 determinants . however ,",
    "if the @xmath21 element is included ( it comes from an inversion asymmetry of the gaas crystal ) the initial 14 @xmath18 14 matrix does not factorize and it is not soluble in terms of a single column of harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "physically , this means that the resulting energy bands are not spherical .",
    "since the nonsphericity of the conduction band in gaas is small , one can solve for the eigenenergies looking for the envelope functions in terms of sums of harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "this leads to number determinants composed of the fundamental 7 @xmath18 7 blocks on the diagonal coupled by nondiagonal parts involving the q elements .",
    "the eigenenergies are computed truncating the resulting big determinants . in our computations",
    "we used typically 21 @xmath18 21 determinants .",
    "all calculations were performed taking the magnetic field * _ b _ * parallel to [ 001 ] direction and putting @xmath23 = 0 .",
    "now we turn to the temperature dependence of the fundamental gap @xmath11 .",
    "it was argued a long time ago [ 13 ] and confirmed by the behavior of the effective mass [ 14 , 15 ] that the temperature dependence of the band parameters is governed by a dilatational change of the energy gap e@xmath25 and not by its total ( i.e. measured ) change . the other contribution to",
    "the change of the gap is due to phonons .",
    "however , the phonon vibrations occur on a much slower time scale than the time the electron needs to sample the interband interactions determining the effective mass and the @xmath0 factor , which are at optical frequencies .",
    "the dilatational change of the gap is given by [ 16 ]    @xmath26    where d is the bulk modulus , @xmath27 is the pressure - induced band - gap shift , and @xmath28 is the linear thermal expansion coefficient ( see also [ 17 ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath29 are readily measurable , the quantity @xmath28 was measured for gaas by novikova [ 18 ] and soma et al [ 19 ] .",
    "using the values of @xmath28 one calculates @xmath30 .",
    "this was done by lourenco et al [ 16 ] , we replot their results in fig .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath28 goes through a minimum near @xmath31 50 k , this results in a plateau and a flat maximum of e@xmath32 seen in fig .",
    "the dilatational change @xmath33 of the fundamental gap between 0 k and 300 k is about 23 mev ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , while the total change @xmath34 is about 93 mev ( cf .",
    "[ 21 , 22 ] ) .",
    "these numbers are important when one tries to understand why putting the total change @xmath35 or the dilatational change @xmath30 into the calculations of @xmath0 value , one obtains very different results in the two cases .",
    "finally , we consider average values of the spin @xmath0 factor measured as a function of temperature .",
    "the measurements are usually done in relatively pure samples having low free electron densities .",
    "the electrons are excited across the gap into the conduction band and into both spin states .",
    "the spin states are equally populated , but the circularly polarized light produces a well defined coherence between them .",
    "the excited electrons quickly thermalize and are distributed among lls according to the lattice temperature without losing their spin or phase",
    ". then they interfere and quantum beats in the photoluminescence or other effects are observed from many lls . according to this picture the observed signal represents an average over the populated lls in which the electron thermal distribution over lls determines their contribution to the average @xmath0 value .",
    "this explains why various experiments performed on weakly doped samples give basically the same results depending only on the temperature .",
    "we assume that the electron energies are @xmath36 where @xmath24 is the ll number , @xmath37 signs correspond to the two spin states , @xmath23 is the wavevector along the direction of * _ b _ * , and @xmath38 is the effective mass at the band edge .",
    "the energies @xmath39 contain the intricacies of the band structure mentioned above , but we first assume a simple parabolic dependence on @xmath23 to make the averaging tractable",
    ". the spin g value is defined as ( in formulas we use @xmath40 symbol ) @xmath41 an averaging procedure involves summation over @xmath24 and integrations over @xmath42 and @xmath23 .",
    "a simple calculation gives the average value of @xmath40 in the form    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 in which the summation is over the lls , @xmath46 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , and the square roots come from the integrations over @xmath23 .",
    "the integrations begin from the lower states @xmath47 for each @xmath24 , which can be either @xmath48 or @xmath49 .    the average @xmath0 value , as given by eq . ( 4 ) ,",
    "is affected by the temperature in two opposite ways . according to the five - level model",
    "the spin @xmath0 value at the conduction band edge is [ 10 ] , @xmath50+\\ ] ] @xmath51 where @xmath52 = @xmath53 , @xmath54 = @xmath55 , @xmath56 = @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the spin - orbit energies @xmath59 and @xmath60 relate to ( @xmath16 , @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath15 , @xmath17 ) levels , respectively , @xmath22 is the interband matrix element of the spin orbit interaction between the ( @xmath16 , @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath15 , @xmath17 ) multiplets ( see [ 10 , 22 ] ) , and @xmath61 is due to far - band contributions . for @xmath22 = 0 eq . ( 7 ) reduces to the formula given first by hermann and weisbuch [ 23 ] .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that , as the temperature @xmath62 increases and the absolute value of the fundamental gap @xmath11 decreases ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the spin @xmath63 value at the band edge decreases . on the other hand , with increasing t",
    "the electrons populate higher lls and band s nonparabolicity comes more and more into play .",
    "the latter is known to make the @xmath0 value less negative ( see refs .",
    "[ 10 , 24 ] , and fig .",
    "3 ) . thus , as @xmath62 increases , the average @xmath40 decreases or increases depending on the relative strength of the two effects .",
    "it is now clear why putting into calculations only the dilatational part of the gap variation makes the first effect weaker , i.e. it favors increase of the @xmath0 values .",
    "we emphasize that we do not use in our calculations eq .",
    "( 7 ) , it is quoted only to make clear the dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath11 . calculating the electron energies away from the band edge we deal with the effects of band s nonparabolicity and inversion asymmetry , as explained above .",
    "we use the following band parameters of gaas at @xmath62 = 0 : @xmath52 = 27.865ev , @xmath54 = 2.361ev , @xmath11 = -1.519 ev , @xmath56 = -1.86 ev , @xmath14 = 2.969 ev , @xmath64 = 3.14 ev , @xmath65 = -2.3107 , @xmath61 = -0.0375 .",
    "the zero of energy is chosen at the conduction band edge .",
    "the above values are the same as those established by an overall fit of various experiments on gaas ( see ref . [ 10 ] ) with the exception of the far - band contribution @xmath61 , as discussed below .",
    "it is assumed that only @xmath11 depends on the temperature , see discussion below .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the @xmath0 values for consecutive lls at two temperatures , as determined from definition ( 3 ) , in which the energies are calculated for @xmath7 = 4 t using the procedure described above .",
    "it is seen that , for a given temperature , as the energy increases with the growing landau number @xmath24 , the @xmath0 factor increases due to band s nonparabolicity . on the other hand , for a given ll",
    "the @xmath0 factor decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "the number of points for a given temperature indicates how many lls are involved in the averaging , for still higher lls the occupation by electrons is so small that their contribution is negligible .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath0 factors shown in fig .",
    "3 do not saturate at high energies at the free electron value of + 2 , as predicted by simple versions of the three - level or five - level * k@xmath1p *   models ( see e.g. [ 24 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that our present theory includes the bulk inversion asymmetry ( also called the dresselhaus effect ) , which is manifested by the appearance of the matrix element q. also , the increase of @xmath0 factor with the energy , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , is stronger than linear , whereas the one shown in fig .",
    "[ 10 ] is weaker than linear .",
    "this is caused by the fact that in fig .",
    "3 the energy increases by going to high lls ( at constant @xmath7 ) , whereas in ref . [",
    "10 ] the energy is increased by going to high magnetic fields ( at @xmath24 = 0 ) .",
    "4 shows the temperature dependent @xmath0 values of electrons extracted from time - resolved faraday rotation measurements performed at @xmath7 = 4 t on undoped bulk gaas ( full squares ) .",
    "in addition , data taken from the literature and our calculations are shown .",
    "as to the experiments , the previously published data obtained with the use of time - resolved photoluminescence [ 1 - 3 ] and time - resolved kerr rotation [ 25 ] are compared with our present results obtained by the time - resolved faraday rotation .",
    "all these time - resolved experiments measure the phase coherence of spin states excited by circularly polarized light in the voigt geometry and differ mostly in its detection .",
    "it is seen that the obtained data agree well with each other and all show an almost linear increase of @xmath0 with the temperature . however , there is some discrepancy between various measured @xmath0 values at @xmath62 = 0 , cf .",
    "[ 23 , 26 , 27 ] . since all the @xmath0 values presented in fig .",
    "4 were measured at magnetic fields @xmath7 of a few tesla , they should be _ higher _ than the band edge value @xmath63 since they are affected by band s nonparabolicity . in this situation",
    "we take the value of the far - band contributions @xmath61 , as given above , to give our measured value of @xmath40 = -0.452 at @xmath62 = 0 and @xmath7 = 4 t. this corresponds to the band edge value @xmath63 = -0.472 .",
    "preference to a different experimental band edge @xmath0 value would simply require a slightly different @xmath61 .",
    "as far as the theory is concerned , we show two calculations .",
    "the dashed line indicates an average value of @xmath0 computed with the help of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , in which the @xmath66 energies are calculated for @xmath7 = 4 t using the procedure outlined above .",
    "it is seen that , as the temperature increases and more lls become populated , the band nonparabolicity effect is stronger than the dilatational decrease of the @xmath11 gap , and the average @xmath67 increases .",
    "still , the theoretical increase does not quite follow the experimental values for @xmath68 60 k. the reason is that our simplified formula ( 2 ) assumes the spin splitting to be independent of @xmath23 .",
    "this means that , as we average over the energy , the @xmath0 value `` jumps '' from one ll to the next , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . in reality , however , the @xmath0 value depends also on @xmath23 . as follows from the simplified three - level * k@xmath1p *   model , the spin @xmath0 value depends in fact on @xmath23 _ similarly _ to its dependence on the orbital energy @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "the decisive quantity is the total electron energy ( see [ 8 , 24 , 28 ] ) . for the second calculation we _ assume _ that this is the case also in the complete five - level * k@xmath1p *   model and we interpolate the @xmath0 value to vary linearly with the energy ( related to @xmath23 ) between consecutive landau levels .",
    "if this is done , the averaging procedure gives the @xmath0 values indicated in fig .",
    "4 by the solid line .",
    "it is seen that now the theory is in an excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the moral of the story is that the almost linear increase of the average spin @xmath0 value with the temperature in gaas is caused by the dominating effect of band s nonparabolicity over the dilatational decrease of the fundamental gap .",
    "it should be emphasized that both our experimental data as well as our two theoretical curves approach the absolute zero of temperature at almost vanishing slope .",
    "it is important that the improved experiment and theory exhibit this property .",
    "coming to the discussion of our results , one should keep in mind that our theoretical description , although representing a considerable improvement over the procedure of ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , is still approximate .",
    "the reason is that we made an assumption about the @xmath23 dependence of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "this assumption is reasonable and it allows us to calculate the @xmath39 energies and carry out the averaging procedure over lls in a relatively simple way .",
    "still , in principle one should include the @xmath23 terms from the beginning in the computation procedure , calculate the @xmath23 dependence of different lls and carry out a numerical summation over @xmath23 values .",
    "this , however , makes the problem difficult for two reasons .",
    "first , if the @xmath23 terms are included , one must take much larger truncated determinants to obtain convergent values of @xmath70 energies .",
    "second , when performing the averaging procedure one must integrate numerically over @xmath23 for each ll separately since in principle each ll has a different @xmath23 dependence .",
    "our simplifying assumption allowed us to get around the above difficulties .",
    "as to the work of other authors , oestreich and ruhle [ 1 ] put into the theoretical description the total temperature change of the energy gap but neglected band s nonparabolicity .",
    "such a description predicted a decrease of the @xmath0 factor with temperature which contradicted the experimental results .",
    "oestreich et al [ 2 ] and huebner et al [ 3 ] included in their description band s nonparabolicity but neglected important features of the band structure : the interband matrix element of momentum q and of the spin orbit interaction @xmath22 between the ( @xmath16 , @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath15 , @xmath17 ) multiplets .",
    "both these quantities have an important influence on the @xmath0 value , which we illustrate numerically . using our band parameters and @xmath71 the band edge @xmath0 value is @xmath63 = -0.472 , while for the same parameters and @xmath22 = 0 there is @xmath63 = -0.346 ( see eq .",
    "the element q does not enter the conduction band edge quantities , but at @xmath62 = 300 k and @xmath7 = 4 t our calculated average value of @xmath0 including q is @xmath67 = -0.297 , while for q = 0 the calculated average is @xmath72 = -0.396 .",
    "also , refs . [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] did not include the landau quantization of the conduction band , so that the calculated average @xmath0 value did not depend on the magnetic field intensity . finally , and this is the decisive point , it was assumed that the @xmath0 value depends on the temperature via the total ( i.e. measured ) change of the fundamental gap , whereas one should take the change due to thermal lattice dilatation alone .",
    "when this is done , there is no need to introduce a temperature variation of the interband matrix element of momentum @xmath19 , as was done in ref .",
    "consideration of the momentum operator and of the wave functions indicates that the interband momentum matrix element should also scale with the lattice dilatation , its square should change no more than 0.1 @xmath73 in the temperature range from 0 to 300 k , so it can be neglected [ 4 ] .    the latest analysis by litvinenko et al [ 4 ] , including the matrix elements @xmath22 and q and the band nonparabolicity on one side and taking only the dilatation contribution to the change of the energy gap on the other , was able to account for the first time for the experimental increase of the spin @xmath0 factor with the temperature . however , this analysis assumed no @xmath23 dependence of the landau levels and , consistently , took the average electron energy for the boltzmann statistics to be equal to @xmath74 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to our dashed curve in fig .",
    "4 , which assumes no dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath23 .",
    "if one includes the @xmath23 dependence of the energy , the average nondegenerate electron energy is @xmath75 which , upon using fig .",
    "3 for @xmath76 , corresponds quite well to the solid line in fig .",
    "4 . in other words",
    ", if one applies a proper averaging procedure to the @xmath0 value , the resulting @xmath67 corresponds quite well to averaging the electron energy @xmath77 and taking @xmath78 .",
    "one should add that , taking the thermal change of gap due to the dilatation alone , litvinenko et al [ 4 ] were able to account correctly for the temperature dependence of the electron spin splitting in insb .",
    "all this , together with the published analysis of @xmath79 in gaas [ 14 , 15 ] , strongly confirms that both orbital and spin quantizations of the electron spectrum in a magnetic field are governed by the change of the energy gap due to lattice dilatation alone .",
    "we investigated experimentally and theoretically the controversial problem of temperature dependence of the spin @xmath0 factor in gaas .",
    "the time - resolved faraday rotation technique was used to show that , in agreement with other data , the @xmath0 factor increases almost linearly with @xmath62 up to room temperature .",
    "this increase is successfully described by the five - level * k@xmath1p *   model of the band structure for gaas .",
    "as the temperature increases there occur two effects having an opposite influence on the @xmath0 value . on one hand , a decrease of the fundamental energy gap caused by",
    "the thermal lattice dilatation leads to a decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , at higher temperatures electrons populate higher landau levels which , due to band s nonparabolicity , leads to an increase of the average @xmath80 value .",
    "a very good agreement of our theory with the experimental increase of @xmath80 indicates that the band nonparabolicity effect dominates .",
    "our interpretation confirms the validity of the complete five - level * k@xmath1p *   model for the conduction band of gaas ."
