    "one of the fundamental problems confronting particle astrophysics is that of baryogenesis , the origin of the abundance of matter over antimatter in the observed universe .",
    "the standard model ( sm )  @xcite and extensions thereof offer the tantalizing possibility of providing an explanation for baryogenesis with physics at the electroweak scale ( for a description of mechanisms of baryogenesis see ref .",
    "although the standard model satisfies the three criteria for baryogenesis : ( i ) violation of baryon number , ( ii ) violation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium  @xcite , a wealth of theoretical evidence combined with experimental bounds on the @xmath1 violating phases in the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) matrix , and the current bounds on the higgs mass , @xmath2 gev , from lep2  @xcite and the most recent lattice simulations  @xcite seem to lead to the conclusion that the minimal standard model  @xcite may not be able to explain the observed baryon asymmetry but perhaps extensions could naturally lead to such an explanation ( for recent reviews see refs .",

    "an important non - equilibrium ingredient for a successful scenario of electroweak baryogenesis is a strongly first order phase transition that proceeds via the nucleation of the true ( broken symmetry ) vacuum in the background of the false ( unbroken symmetry ) vacuum plus non - trivial topological field configurations , the sphalerons , that are responsible for the baryon violating processes  @xcite .    amongst the several proposals for explaining the baryon asymmetry , we focus on transport aspects related to non - local or charge transfer baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "this scenario assumes a strongly first order phase transition in the electroweak theory ( or extensions thereof )  @xcite . as the nucleated bubbles of the broken phase in the background of the unbroken ( false vacuum ) phase",
    "expand , a flux of fermions from the unbroken phase scatter off the bubble walls , @xmath1 violating interactions near the wall are converted to an asymmetry in the baryon number via sphaleron processes in the unbroken phase  @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient in this scenario is the transport properties of chiral fermions in the regime of small spatial momentum  @xcite but in a _",
    "plasma _ at temperature @xmath3 gev .",
    "in particular there are two different regimes for non - local baryogenesis depending on whether the mean free path of the quarks is smaller or larger than the width of the bubble walls  @xcite .",
    "the hot plasma modifies dramatically the properties of fermions  @xcite , in particular when @xmath4 with @xmath5 the gauge coupling constant and @xmath6 the zero temperature fermion mass , the fermion spectrum is characterized by two branches of _ collective excitations _ , one branch corresponds to the in - medium renormalized fermion , with a positive ratio of chirality to helicity , and the other branch is a novel collective excitation in the medium , the plasmino , with a negative ratio of chirality to helicity  @xcite .",
    "the two branches have a gap @xmath7 corresponding to an effective fermion mass that does not break chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the fermion and plasmino branches describe excitations with different chirality properties and therefore these are bound to play an important role in charge transfer ( non - local ) mechanisms of baryogenesis  @xcite . for soft momenta @xmath8 these branches",
    "are very different from each other , while for large momenta @xmath9 they approach the usual fermion dispersion relation , and the amplitude of plasmino excitations ( the wave function renormalization ) vanishes exponentially fast  @xcite . whereas dispersion relations of soft collective excitations in the plasma within the context of baryogenesis had been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended to describe neutralinos in the medium in supersymmetric extensions in ref .",
    "@xcite , the damping or thermalization rate has only been studied at zero spatial momentum , i.e. , the collective excitations are at rest with respect to the plasma  @xcite or for hard spatial momentum  @xcite @xmath10 .    early attempts to estimate the diffusion coefficient made use of boltzmann equations and a series of approximations including a simplification of the gluon propagator  @xcite .",
    "some of those results were reproduced in  @xcite for quarks of _ hard _ momentum , @xmath11 .",
    "the two limits that were previously studied , zero spatial momentum and very large spatial momentum ( @xmath10 ) , _ do not _ reveal important features of the collective excitations which are only present at non - zero but soft momenta @xmath12 where the dispersion relations are different  @xcite . at zero spatial momentum ,",
    "both branches of the fermionic dispersion relation , i.e. , fermions and plasminos coincide and therefore the damping rates for both collective excitations must be the same . in the opposite limit @xmath10 ,",
    "the fermion branch approaches the dispersion relation of an ordinary vacuum fermion losing all features of the collective behavior , and the plasmino branch decouples from the spectrum because its wave function renormalization vanishes exponentially .    in this article",
    "we present a detailed study of the relaxation rates ( damping or thermalization rates ) and mean free paths for _ soft _ collective excitations with non - vanishing momenta @xmath8 in a theory that includes both gauge and yukawa interactions . to our knowledge such study had not been pursued before within the context of gauge and scalar ( yukawa ) interactions .",
    "furthermore , since the different collective excitations have different group velocities , it is important to understand in detail their mean free paths .",
    "this is very relevant for non - local baryogenesis  @xcite , since the mean free path determines the attenuation length for the transport of chirality by the different collective excitations . as emphasized above , the different branches correspond to collective excitations with _ opposite _ ratios of chirality to helicity , and different dispersion relations .",
    "our _ main observations _ in this article are that the transport properties of these two different collective excitations for soft momenta will in general be _",
    "different_. since these excitations carry chirality , different damping or relaxation rates will result in _ different mean free paths for collective excitations carrying opposite chirality_. as has been argued repeatedly in the literature  @xcite the transport of chirality plays a fundamental role in non - local baryogenesis , thus a consistent microscopic study of baryogenesis in these scenarios must necessarily address the transport of chirality by the soft collective excitations and is the motivation for our study .",
    "an important aspect of soft excitations in a plasma is that their consistent description requires a non - perturbative resummation scheme , the hard thermal loop ( htl ) program  @xcite . for soft excitations with @xmath8 and vacuum masses @xmath13 ( with @xmath5 the generic gauge coupling constant ) the leading corrections from the thermal self - energies in the high temperature limit are of @xmath14 , hence of the same order as the tree level terms in the propagators .",
    "the leading htl correction is determined by the hard momentum region in the self - energy loop  @xcite . however , the damping rate of soft collective excitations require that the fermion and gauge bosons propagators and vertices in the self - energy be htl resummed  @xcite .",
    "the htl resummation rendered infrared finite the damping rate of collective excitations at rest in the plasma  @xcite , however the damping rate of _ moving _ collective excitations is infrared divergent arising from the exchange of transverse gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "whereas in qcd ( and in the su(2 ) sector of the electroweak theory ) the putative non - perturbative magnetic mass provides an infrared cutoff  @xcite , in qed ( and certainly the u(1 ) sector of the electroweak theory ) such a possibility is unavailable and the infrared divergence remains  @xcite .",
    "the fermion propagator in qed has been studied within the eikonal ( bloch - nordsieck ) approximation in _ real time _",
    "this analysis revealed an anomalous relaxation that explained the nature of the infrared divergences in the abelian theory and determined that the relaxation time scale of fermionic collective excitations @xmath15^{-1}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "this anomalous relaxation was recently reproduced via different methods in scalar qed  @xcite that has the same leading htl structure as qcd and qed for the fermion and gauge boson propagators  @xcite .",
    "although there is no magnetic screening mass in the abelian theory , the relaxation scales obtained by refs .",
    "@xcite are _ similar _ to those obtained in qcd  @xcite .",
    "more recently we have obtained the damping rate for fermions in a fermion - scalar plasma and pointed out that the decay of a heavy scalar ( higgs ) into fermion pair results in a quasiparticle width for the fermion , i.e. , the scalar decay leads to a fermion damping rate  @xcite . in this article",
    "we combine the results obtained in qcd and qed for the damping rate of the collective excitations with the contribution from the scalars to provide a detailed understanding of the relaxation scales and mean free paths for the soft chirality carrying collective excitations in the plasma .    * the goals : * in this article we study in detail the damping rates and mean free paths of soft collective excitations in a plasma of gauge , fermion and scalar particles as befits the scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the focus is to provide a quantitative study of the _ different _ relaxation scales for the soft collective excitations with opposite ratios of chirality to helicity .",
    "however , rather than studying these aspects in the full standard electroweak model or any particular extension of it , we focus on the understanding of the robust and generic features of the damping rates and mean free paths of soft collective excitations in an abelian plasma of fermions , gauge bosons and scalars with simple yukawa couplings .",
    "the main reasons why the results of this simplification _ are relevant _ to the physics of the electroweak theory , are that :    \\(i ) the structure of hard thermal loops is similar in the abelian and non - abelian theories  @xcite with the differences only in the gauge group factors and strength of couplings .",
    "this is manifestly explicit in similar damping rates obtained for qcd and qed  @xcite .",
    "a very complete study of the dispersion relations for collective excitations in the electroweak plasma has been provided in ref .",
    "the results of that work clearly show that the htl contributions to the self - energies are universal in the sense that the strong , weak and higgs sectors yield contributions that are similar in form and only differ in the appropriate gauge group structure factors .",
    "\\(ii ) the simple physics that leads to the damping of fermionic excitations via the decay of a heavy scalar  @xcite is fairly robust and transcends a particular model , it is mainly described by the kinematics of the decay of a heavy scalar into fermion pair in the medium .    to model the set of parameters of the electroweak theory we assume a scalar of mass @xmath16 gev according with the current lep2 bounds on the higgs mass  @xcite , and a first order phase transition temperature @xmath3 gev which results in @xmath17 .",
    "this will become important in the analysis of the scalar contribution to the fermion self - energy .",
    "furthermore we will focus on the lightest quarks and leptons for which @xmath18 with @xmath6 being the fermion vacuum mass . only for the lightest fermions we expect soft collective excitations in the medium , since for fermions with @xmath19 the in - medium corrections to the self - energy are perturbatively small for weak couplings . for these lightest generations , the yukawa couplings @xmath20 and the scalar contributions to the fermionic self - energies are perturbative .",
    "however , as we will see in detail below , the scalar contribution to the damping rates and mean free paths is important .    *",
    "main results : * the main results can be summarized with the statement that for soft collective excitations that carry opposite ratios of chirality to helicity , i.e. , fermions and plasminos , the damping rates @xmath21 and mean free paths @xmath22 are _ different_. the difference in these relaxation scales is maximal in the range of momenta @xmath12 .",
    "the difference in the mean free paths of the soft collective modes is dominated by the scalar contribution that we explicitly compute in eq .",
    "( [ scalarrate ] ) .",
    "the gauge boson contribution to the damping rate of moving collective excitations arises mainly from the absorption and emission of soft transverse gauge bosons for which a hard thermal loop resummation of the propagators and vertices is required . on the other hand",
    "the scalar contribution to the damping rates arises from the _ decay _ of the scalar into a hard single particle excitation and a soft collective excitation .",
    "both contributions are different for the different branches , in the gauge case the difference is determined by the different group velocities .",
    "we also provide a wave packet analysis to extract the mean free paths of the moving collective excitations .",
    "we find that the _ difference _ of mean free paths for the collective excitations with different ratios of chirality to helicity is mainly determined by the _",
    "scalar _ contribution to the damping rates . the mean free paths and their difference are explicitly given by eqs .",

    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the renormalized , real - time dirac equation for fermions in the medium , the renormalization aspects are important for consistency because we need to isolate the wave function renormalization factors for the collective excitations .",
    "the main reason for studying the effective in - medium dirac equation in _ real time _ is that this formulation allows us to extract unambiguously the mean free paths or attenuation lengths by focusing on the time evolution of wave packets of collective excitations .",
    "this treatment bypasses the assumptions of transport by diffusion .",
    "furthermore , in this manner we can make direct contact with the results of refs .",

    "iv we study the time evolution of wave packets of collective excitations and extract the mean free paths or attenuation lengths .",
    "we then show that the main contribution to the _ difference _ between the mean free paths for the two soft collective excitations arises from the scalar contribution to the damping rate .",
    "v summarizes our results and describes their implications for the standard model ( or its extensions ) and points out the possible modifications to our results in extensions of the standard model that include light scalars .",
    "an unambiguous identification of the damping rates requires an analysis of the retarded propagators in the complex frequency plane .",
    "the lifetimes ( damping rates ) are identified as complex poles in the unphysical riemann sheet .    rather than computing the self - energies in imaginary time and",
    "perform the analytic continuations to obtain the retarded self - energies in the complex frequency plane , we obtain the effective dirac equation directly in _",
    "real time_. this alternative approach has two main advantages : ( i ) it allows us to make contact with the real - time results for the relaxation of the single particle green s function presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , ( ii ) by following the space - time evolution of an initially prepared wave packet of collective excitations we can extract directly the mean free paths .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we consider an abelian theory with one fermion species and one real scalar coupled to the fermion via a yukawa interaction .",
    "we will work in the coulomb gauge in which @xmath23 because the htl self - energies have a more clear interpretation in this gauge .",
    "the self - energies in leading order in htl have been proven to be the same in coulomb gauge and in covariant and axial gauges  @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides a discussion of the gauge parameter independence of the htl contribution to the self - energies .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by @xmath24 + { \\cal l}_i[\\phi]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the grassmann valued source terms were introduced to obtain the effective dirac equation in the medium by analyzing the linear response to these sources  @xcite .",

    "the main reason for going through the renormalization is to extract the wave functions corresponding to the collective excitations since these will be important for the calculation of the damping rates . by choosing the wave function renormalization @xmath41 to be defined on - shell at zero temperature , we isolate the finite temperature from the zero temperature renormalizations unambiguously and recognize the wave function renormalization for the collective excitations directly .",
    "we have included the finite temperature corrections to the scalar mass in the renormalized lagrangian and explicitly introduced a finite temperature counterterm .",
    "the scalar mass receives finite temperature corrections also from hard thermal loops , proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "as it will become clear below we are interested in the kinematic decay of the higgs into the fermionic collective modes which will contribute to their mean free paths . by including the finite temperature corrected higgs mass in the lagrangian",
    "allows to treat the kinematic decay in terms of the in - medium corrected mass directly .",
    "the counterterm @xmath43 will be chosen consistently to cancel the finite temperature corrections to the mass .",
    "there is a small caveat , however , we envisage our analysis to be valid both in the ( homogeneous ) unbroken and the broken symmetry phases in the case of a strongly first order phase transition . the mass term in the lagrangian",
    "should then be defined as the position of the pole of the finite temperature propagator for the higgs .",
    "we will implicitly use this definition of the higgs mass in what follows .",
    "furthermore in our analysis we will _ assume _ that in either case , unbroken or broken symmetry phases the effective higgs mass is large enough that its kinematic decay into the soft fermionic collective excitations is allowed , in particular we _ assume _ that @xmath44 . in the broken symmetry phase and for a strong first order phase transition @xmath45 with @xmath46 this assumption seems reasonable , in the unbroken phase whether this condition is satisfied depends on the details and strength of the first order phase transition . if the effective mass in either phase does not allow the kinematical decay of the in - medium higgs into soft fermionic collective modes then there is no higgs contribution to their mean free path .",
    "estimates based on the finite temperature effective potential would seem to suggest that the higgs mass may not be much heavier than @xmath47@xcite , but conclusions based on effective potentials in gauge theories are fraught with ambiguities such as the gauge dependence of the effective potential which translates into gauge dependence of off - shell quantities , and the fact that the effective potential becomes complex@xcite near its minimum . a higgs mass defined as",
    "the second derivative of the effective potential at its minimum is not an on - shell quantity@xcite ( since the effective potential is defined at zero four momentum ) , only the position of the pole of the higgs propagator is an on - shell and therefore gauge invariant quantity .",
    "given the uncertainties on the scalar sector of the standard model , only a sound _ experimental _ bound can validate or rule out the assumption used in this work on the value of the higgs mass .",
    "we must also point out that our analysis is valid in the unbroken or the broken symmetry phases ( under the proviso of the kinematic constraint for the decay of the higgs ) but certainly _ not _ near the wall of a nucleating bubble .",
    "the nature of the soft fermionic collective excitations in the presence of a wall is not well understood , since the hard thermal loop resummation that leads to the collective excitations is only valid in an homogeneous equilibrium background .",
    "thus before we can extrapolate our analysis to the case of collective fermionic excitations near a bubble wall a consistent study of the effects of the wall on these collective modes must be pursued . as mentioned above our goal",
    "is to provide a quantitative analysis of the mean free paths of the soft fermionic collective modes at least in the homogeneous phases , with particular attention to the _ difference _ of mean free paths of the different collective modes .",
    "the dynamics of expectation values and correlation functions of the quantum field is obtained by implementing the schwinger - keldysh closed - time - path formulation of non - equilibrium quantum field theory  @xcite .",

    "in particular away from the minimum from the plasmino branch and using @xmath251 , the difference in mean free paths is approximately given by @xmath252~. \\label{differencemean}\\ ] ]    thus the fermion and plasmino soft collective excitations have different mean free paths and the difference is determined mostly by the heavy scalar decay into a hard and a soft collective excitation .",
    "we have focused our attention on the transport properties of soft collective excitations in an abelian gauge , fermion and scalar plasma with the goal of understanding chirality transport as relevant for non - local baryogenesis .",
    "our main observation is that the transport properties of _ soft _ collective excitations are different for the different branches of the fermionic dispersion relation .",
    "since these collective excitations carry ratios of chirality to helicity @xmath161 , different transport coefficients , i.e. , damping rates and mean free paths for these excitations will result in a differential transport of chirality .",
    "there are two main physical mechanisms that lead to different transport properties : ( i ) the absorption and emission of soft gauge bosons that are dynamically screened by landau damping on scales @xmath80 and by a magnetic mass for the non - abelian sector on scales @xmath253 .",
    "( ii ) the _ decay _ of the heavy scalar ( higgs ) particle into hard fermion and a soft fermion or plasmino results in a contribution to the damping rate of on - shell collective excitations .",
    "the physical aspects of these two phenomena are fairly robust , in particular the hard thermal loop structure of the fermionic self - energy has the _ same form _ in the abelian ( qed ) and non - abelian ( sm ) theories , with the only differences being in the overall scales ( see for example ref .  @xcite",
    "wherein the contributions of the weak and scalar sectors to the leading htl fermion self - energy had been computed in detail ) .",
    "the decay of a heavy higgs into a hard fermion and a soft collective excitation is a consequence of simple kinematics in the heat bath and is therefore fairly independent of the model .",
    "obviously the strength of the yukawa couplings and the group representation of the scalar fields will change the overall normalization of the scalar contribution .    therefore we believe that the results obtained in this article are relevant for non - local baryogenesis in the standard model or extensions thereof and that the main ingredients that determine the different transport coefficients described in this study are fairly robust .",
    "we have combined detailed studies of the damping rates of moving fermionic quasiparticles  @xcite and extended the recently studied phenomenon of fermionic damping rates via heavy scalar decay  @xcite to provide a description of the damping rates and mean free paths of collective excitations with momenta @xmath254 to leading order in hard thermal loop resummation and lowest order in yukawa coupling .",
    "this analysis is valid for the lightest quarks and leptons in the standard model ( certainly _ not _ the top quark ) and both in the symmetric and broken symmetry phases , since for the lightest fermions @xmath255 with @xmath6 the vacuum masses .",
    "the main uncertainties in our results stem from the infrared sensitivity of the gauge contributions to the fermionic damping rate , in particular the magnetic sector and its non - perturbative screening scale .",
    "this is still an ongoing subject of active study  @xcite and certainly beyond the scope of this article .",
    "however as argued persuasively in  @xcite the results given by eqs .",
    "( [ infrarate ] ) are trustworthy for @xmath256 and away from the minimum in the plasmino branch when the plasmino group velocity vanishes . for",
    "a first order phase transition the higgs mass does not vary much near the phase transition from its vacuum value @xmath257 .",
    "this translates into that the scalar contribution to the fermionic self - energy is not sensitive to the infrared behavior and does not require hard - thermal loop resummation .    by casting our studies in terms of the real time , in - medium effective dirac equation",
    ", we were able to study the real time evolution of wave packets of collective excitations and extract unambiguously the mean free paths or attenuation lengths for the different collective excitations .",
    "this approach transcends any approximation that relies on a diffusive description of transport .",
    "our main results are summarized by the expressions : ( [ scalarrate ] ) for the scalar contribution to the damping rate and ( [ meanfre ] ) for the mean free paths for the soft collective excitations with @xmath176 and away from the plasmino minimum @xmath246 .",
    "the main observation is that the _ difference _ of mean free paths for the fermion and plasmino branches for @xmath256 and away from the minimum of the plasmino branch is approximately given by eq .",
    "( [ differencemean ] ) , i.e. , _ mainly _ determined by the different _ scalar _ contributions to the damping rate of the collective excitations .",
    "the uncertainties near the region of the plasmino minimum are related to the infrared sensitivity of the fermionic damping rates and require a careful analysis of the infrared region of the htl resummed self - energies , such a study is currently under way .",
    "there is potentially an important exception to the validity and robustness of our results in the case of extensions of the standard model that include scalars that are too light .",
    "light scalars are common in supersymmetric extensions and extensions with more than one doublet .",
    "they are welcome because they tend to increase the strength of the first order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "if light scalars are present , their contribution to the fermionic self - energy will have to be understood in detail and assess in each particular model whether an htl resummation of the scalar propagator as well as that of the fermion in the loop is necessary .",
    "clearly such cases must be analyzed in detail for the particular models .",
    "a very important limitation of our results is the knowledge of the damping rate of the plasmino near the region where its group velocity vanishes . as recognized by the authors  @xcite of the original work , in this region",
    "there are further contributions to the plasmino damping rate that must be understood in detail .",
    "we think that the novel results found in this article for the transport of chirality by soft collective excitations reveal new features which are distinct from those previously obtained for hard excitations and could have an important impact in mechanisms of local baryogenesis .",
    "whereas the main focus of this article has been a quantitative understanding of chirality transport by _ soft _ collective excitations and a detailed understanding of the gauge and scalar contributions to the transport coefficients , obviously the next step is to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of these new results on the baryon asymmetry within particular extensions of the standard model .",
