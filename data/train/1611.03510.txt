    "the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) encodes the details of two main physical processes that shape how galaxies form and evolve : namely , the gas accretion that s fuel star formation ; and the resulting feedback .",
    "constraining the spatial distribution and dynamical state of the cgm around high - redshift galaxies is thus of critical importance to test our current theoretical framework of galaxy formation .",
    "however , the diffuse nature of the cgm poses a major observational challenge .",

    "diffuse ly@xmath0 emission , or lyman alpha halos ( lahs ) , around high - redshift galaxies , may open a new avenue for the cgm study : ly@xmath0 photons  which are presumably produced copiously at sites of star formation  can be resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen gas out to large galactocentric distances ; as a result , the  emission is expected to appear more extended than the rest - frame uv continuum . with sophisticated and self - consistent models of ly@xmath0 radiative transfer modeling",

    "recent  and uv observations also suggest that  emitting galaxies in the local universe ubiquitously produce large - scale halos of scattered  emission @xcite . in spite of the observational progress",
    ", it is still unclear what is the dominant power source that produces extended ly@xmath0 emission around galaxies . while star formation inside the host galaxy is likely to produce ly@xmath0 photons that scatter through the medium , spatially extended ly@xmath0 emission",
    "may also originate from widespread low - level star formation activity or from the cooling radiation of collisionally heated infalling gas , beyond the regions revealed by rest - frame uv or ir emission .",
    "the uncertainty of ionizing source distributions from these auxiliary mechanisms remains a major obstacle to establishing a direct relation between the appearance of lahs and the physical properties of cgm .",
    "on the other hand , the variations of lah characteristics measured in different high - redshift galaxy samples clearly require physical explanations .",
    "based on different sample selections , some studies find more extended halos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s11 ) than others @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can alter @xmath5 photon propagation and the lah surface brightness profile ; the  spatial extent may be also strongly related to the surrounding mpc - scale environments @xcite , provided that the cgm gas structure or the ionizing source distribution outside the host galaxy ( i.e. , satellite galaxies and gas accretion ) is related to the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "next , we determine the psfs of individual images using two different approaches . in the first method , we adopt a procedure similar to that outlined by @xcite as follows .",
    "we first run sextractor @xcite to create the source catalog of each image .",
    "a list of relatively bright but unsaturated stars is created based on the compactness parameter ( class_star@xmath690.95 ) , and then cross - referenced with the guide star catalogs v2.3.2 ( gsc , class=0 : * ? ? ?",
    "based on the catalogs and visual inspection , sources with blending issues or with a companion within 5@xmath70 are removed from the list .",
    "we measure the radial profile of each star by azimuthally averaging in bins of annuli , and normalize the profile at 2  from center .",
    "then we take a median average of all normalized star radial profiles to derive the psfs out to 4 . independently from this procedure , we measure the large - scale ` wings ' of the psf from the gsc stars that are saturated in our data .",
    "we first mask saturated pixels and determine the centroids by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to the unmasked pixels .",
    "the outer radial profile is then measured at 26 , and is combined with the inner profile by matching the amplitude at 3 .    in an alternative approach ,",
    "we use a software psfex @xcite to derive psf models .",
    "psfex uses the information supplied by a sextractor source catalog to iteratively reject sources that are saturated , contaminated , or extended , and then automatically selects point source candidates to constructs a non - parametric psf model .",
    "specifically , for each image , we supply a input catalog including the sources with ellipicity@xmath710.1 and snr_win@xmath6930 , where ellipicity and snr_win are sextractor parameters defined as source ellipticity and window - based signal - to - noise ratio , respectively .",
    "although psfex will reject any saturated sources and does not use the broad light profile of saturated objected to derive psf as our first method , a larger number of point sources are usually included to construct the psf due to the efficient automated selection criteria . in the psfex - based method , we also model the psf spatial variation within each image using second - order polynomial components .",

    "a smooth convolution kernel is derived by comparing the circularized psf of each image with the reference using an idl  deconvolution routine max_likelihood .",

    "having homogenized all the images to a common psf within @xmath73 , we adopt the following procedure for image stacking preparation and galaxy light profile measurements :    first , we make a @xmath74 cutout image centered on each galaxy .",
    "sextractor is run on the image twice to detect all objects down to 1.5@xmath75 and 2@xmath75 with detect_minarea@xmath76pixel and back_size@xmath77 .",
    "we apply a gaussian filter with a fwhm of 2 pixels for improving detection of extended faint objects . using the sextractor segmentation maps , we mask all 2@xmath75 detection pixels belonging to interlopers ( i.e. , sources not at center ) and expand individual mask regions to adjacent 1.5@xmath75 regions for a more robust exclusion of low - level contaminants .",
    "cutout images are then oversampled to 0.086/pixel ( i.e. , one third of the original pixel size ) using a nearest - neighbor interpolation , with the object centroid located at the center pixel of the resampled image .",
    "finer resampling ensures that image stacking can be conducted without introducing further broadening due to sub - pixel centroid uncertainties . finally , we `` repair '' the masked regions as follows . for each pixel within mask regions , we determine its distance from the galaxy center .",
    "then we replace its value with the median value of the unmasked pixels at a similar projected galactocentric distance and further add pseudo noise commensurate with the measured cutout background noise .",
    "this additional step ensures all objects contribute equally to each pixel of the stacked image .",
    "generally , less than 20% of the pixels in the cutout images are masked .",
    "whenever more than 20% of the area is masked out , we do not include the galaxy in stacking procedure .    following the method detailed in appendix[sec : flya ] , we create ly@xmath0 and line - free continuum images at rest - frame @xmath78  using two bands sampling both ly@xmath0 and uv continuum emission , which we refer to as the narrow and broad bands bands for the pcf sample , and",

    "this procedure excludes @xmath313% and @xmath32% of the lab sample and pcf sample , respectively",
    ". the higher level of source removal in the lab sample is a result of the fact that the subaru _ ia445 _ band image contains a larger number of artifacts ( ccd bleeding and diffraction spikes around bright stars ; see figure [ fig : pcflab_env ] ) , thus requires more aggressive masking in order to avoid contamination .",
    "the cutout images likely still contain emission from nearby sources below our adopted detection threshold .",
    "they may introduce negative or positive bias regions in  cutout images due to imperfect continuum subtraction .",
    "however , assuming that these undetected objects are randomly distributed in individual cutout images without the presence of clustering , their contribution should be similar across all pixels of the stacked image . to create a  contamination - free \" stacked image",

    "this procedure removes the bias introduced by undetected objects , but limits our ability to detect any diffuse emission beyond the central region 12  in diameter ( corresponding to 88kpc and 98kpc in the angular distance , for our samples at @xmath25 and @xmath89 , respectively ) .",
    "the choice of the annular region size will be further discussed in appendix[sec : stack_effect ] .",
    "the radial surface brightness profiles are measured by azimuthally averaging the pixel values in successive bins of annuli from source center .",

    "this simple approach was adopted in several previous works @xcite , with the caveat that the center light profile could be heavily influenced by the psf .",
    "the measurements may also suffer from large uncertainties at large radii where the surface brightness profile is lost in the background noise . in our analysis",

    "the range corresponds to 1344kpc for the pcf sample , or 1449kpc for the lab sample .",

    "we simultaneously fit both of the  and uv continuum using the above model , with @xmath99 largely constrained by the continuum light profile .",
    "this decomposition model automatically accounts for the psf effect on both  and uv continuum images , such that we can take a full advantage of the measured radial profile at all ranges . on the other hand , the uncertainties of the single - component scalelength",
    "is expected to be more sensitive to the selected projected galactocentric radii and large - scale psf profile .",
    "we refer interested readers to appendix[sec : psf_effect ] , where we provide extensive discussions on this topic .              in figures[fig :",

    "thus , the majority of galaxies in the s11 samples should have both higher ly@xmath0 and uv surface brightness than those in our pcf sample even if their spectra are flat ( @xmath113 . a redder spectrum would make the gap even larger , which is more likely as continuum bright galaxies tend to be redder ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we note that these different scenarios may not be independent from one another .",

    ". analyses on large and well - controlled subsamples representing different galaxy properties will be crucial to further investigate the primary driver that determines lah sizes , and thereby constrain the physical origin of lahs , which is the subject of  [ sec : results ] . as a caveat , we also explore how different stacking methods and data characteristics may impact the shape of the surface brightness profiles and lah scalelengths in appendices[sec : stack_effect ] and [ sec : psf_effect ] .",
    "these investigations are not directly related to the physical properties of lahs , but crucial in quantifying the robustness of the measurements and associated uncertainties , as well as in understanding the possible origin of discrepancies found among different results in the literature .",
    "it is interesting to consider how our scalelength measurements of high - redshift laes compare with those of local ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "@xcite measured the petrosian radii @xcite , @xmath123 , for 14 galaxies in their lyman alpha  reference sample ( lars , hereafter ) , and found that they range in @xmath124  kpc . because the authors published only the petrosian radii and not the two- and one - dimensional light profiles , it is not straightforward for us to make direct comparisons of their measurements to our scalelengths . by assuming that the intrinsic profiles are radially symmetric and decline exponentially with projected galactocentric distance",
    ", we find an exponential profile with a scalelength of 6  kpc corresponds to @xmath12522  kpc . on the other hand",
    ", we estimate values of @xmath126@xmath127kpc by directly computing from our stacked ly@xmath0 images obtained at lower physical resolutions .",
    "hence , high - redshift laes in our sample appear to have somewhat more extended lahs than the lars galaxies .",
    "however , we caution that our @xmath123 estimates are only approximate and more likely upper limits , because properly accounting for the psf blurring effect and adding a compact galaxy - like emitting component ( instead of a single exponential profile ) may lead to smaller petrosian radii .",
    "galaxies in our sample reside in a wide range of environments , including at least three massive protoclusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also  [ sec : datasample ] ) .",
    "hence , we are well positioned to explore how the lah characteristics depend on local galaxy density .",
    "we begin by estimating the local lae density for each sample .      as for the pcf sample",
    ", the filter width of the nb filter corresponds to an effective line - of - sight distance of 27mpc comoving ( or 5.6mpc physical ) , qualitatively comparable to the expected size of ( unvirialized ) forming clusters at the same redshift @xcite .",
    "moreover , the redshift distribution of pc  217.96 + 32.3 peaks sharply close to the value corresponding to the central wavelength of the nb filter @xcite .",
    "hence , the use of surface overdensity with smoothing scales of fwhm=510mpc is well justified as a proxy for the three - dimensional overdensity with minimal contamination by foreground and background interlopers .",
    "we determine the surface overdensity , @xmath128 , as a function of image positions as the following .",
    "first , the two dimensional lae distribution map is smoothed with a gaussian kernel of fwhm=10mpc ( or @xmath129 ) .",
    "second , the _ field _ lae density , @xmath130 , is estimated by dividing the number of laes within the effective area ( excluding masked regions ) after removing the sources likely associated with pc  217.96 + 32.3 . as detailed in @xcite , our estimate of the mean lae density is roughly twice as large as that expected in the field based on integrating the @xmath120 ly@xmath0 luminosity function determined by @xcite .",
    "thus , our estimate of the overdensity is likely a conservative one .",
    "finally , the lae surface overdensity is computed as : @xmath131 while all galaxies , including lbgs , are assigned an overdensity parameter based on their image positions , the overdensity itself is determined solely based on the angular distribution of laes .    for the lab sample at @xmath34 ,",
    "the same technique is unlikely to yield galaxy overdensity parameters in a meaningful manner .",
    "the intermediate filter _ ia445 _ , used to identify photometric candidates of laes at @xmath34 , spans a line - of - sight distance of 190mpc , and thus the shot noise from interlopers is expected to play a more significant role in the measured surface overdensity .",
    "therefore , we decide to limit our analyses to the spectroscopic sample and estimate galaxy overdensity in a three dimensional comoving volume using the following procedure : first , we construct a 3d lae map based on their image positions and redshift , assuming the measured ly@xmath0 redshift as systemic redshift ; second , the map is smoothed with a 3d gaussian kernel of fwhm=20  mpc ; finally , a 3d overdensity , @xmath132 , is computed using an equation similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : sdelta ] .    as described in ",
    "[ sec : datasample ] , our hectospec observations resulted in a relatively uniform spectroscopic coverage only in the middle two thirds of the field .",
    "the remaining region , namely the eastern and western end of the field totaling @xmath133  deg@xmath44 in area , is excluded from our 3d overdensity measurements and subsequent analysis .",
    "the use of ly@xmath0 redshift in determination of their line - of - sight position can lead to an error in our overdensity estimation . however , such uncertainties are likely negligible in the present case .",
    "a typical offset between ly@xmath0-derived and systemic redshift is @xmath134@xmath135 or @xmath136@xmath137  in velocity space .",
    "these offsets will lead to the positional error of 3.44.6mpc comoving , much smaller than the adopted smoothing scale of 20mpc .",
    "more reliastically , the positional error is even smaller than the above values as most laes should have their ly@xmath0 line shifted in the same direction with similar magnitudes .    in figure[fig :",

    "the highest overdensity region ( @xmath138 ) is located slightly off center in the southeastern direction , coinciding with the position of the ly@xmath0 blob , labd05 , marked as large open square @xcite .",
    "our choices of smoothing kernels ( 10  mpc and 20  mpc for the pcf and lab samples , respectively ) are justified by the observed surface density of laes in these fields . a smoothing kernel size ",
    "i.e. , the effective volume within which the galaxies are counted  should be large enough to enclose a relatively large number galaxies to minimize shot noise in the overdensity estimate .",
    "the transverse distance to the nearest neighbor for the pcf sample ranges from 0.3  mpc to 9.7  mpc with a median value of 2.7  mpc . as for the lab sample ,",
    "the total ( transverse ) distance to the nearest neighbor spans 0.7 ( 0.4 )  mpc to 31.5 ( 18.1 )  mpc with the median of 7.8 ( 4.5 )  mpc .",
    "our adopted kernels are large enough to enclose at least one lae in the least concentrated region .",
    "the above overdensity estimates should be a good relative measure to distinguish overdense or underdense regions within a single field .",
    "however , they are inadequate to be compared with one another or with similar measures in other surveys , because measured overdensity is generally a function of smoothing scale , imaging or spectroscopic depth of the survey , and filter - determined redshift range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a larger smoothing kernel ( 2d or 3d ) would effectively average over more galaxies , reducing the shot noise of the overdensity measure at the expense of washing out features that are smaller than the size of the kernel .",
    "conversely , using too small a kernel would exaggerate the overdensity parameter .",
    "a broader nb filter would increase the shot noise from unassociated sources in the foreground and background , washing out the signal from a coherent structure .",
    "the imaging and spectroscopic depth not only influence the overall error budget due to shot noise but also determine the average bias of the galaxy population uncovered as a result of such a survey .",

    "the characteristics of the lab field lie in the middle between those of the pcf and ssa22 structures , and we also excluded the very luminous ly@xmath0 blob ( labd05 ) identified in @xcite in the highest overdensity subsamples .",
    "it is not clear the contribution of ly@xmath0 blobs in the lah characteristics in the stacking result of @xcite .",
    "but our test of including labd05 does suggest the lah scalelength from two - component fit could increase to @xmath368 to @xmath369 , leading to a weak positive correlation between the lah scalelength and overdensity .",
    "careful and uniform reanalyses of all protocluster data and a study based on larger samples of protocluster systems in the future are required to understand the relatively significance of ly@xmath0 blobs in the averaged galaxy ly@xmath0 halo properties .      the average lah sizes increase with uv luminosity in both of our galaxy samples ( figure  [ fig : slen_prop ] , middle ) .",
    "at the lowest luminosities , @xmath370@xmath371 , the measured scalelengths range in @xmath372@xmath100kpc , similar to those reported by @xcite for individual laes of comparable continuum luminosities .",
    "however , the lah size in @xmath373 doubles from 4.2kpc to 8.6kpc for the lowest to highest luminosity bin in the lab sample .    to evaluate the significance of this correlation",
    ", we use safe_correlate routine in the idl  astronomy users library .",
    "the routine can simulate new realizations of scalelengths based on the measured values and their uncertainties , and then determine the overall probability that the apparent @xmath373@xmath374 trend could be due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "for the lab sample , the test suggests a low probability of the null hypothesis ( @xmath3759% ) . for the pcf sample , safe_correlate ( which is based on the spearman rank correlation ) can not provide useful insight on the correlation significance because we only have two subsamples due to the limited dynamics range in the sample uv luminosity .",
    "however , the positive correlation trend between @xmath373 and @xmath374 still holds .",
    "we also stack 21 lbgs in the pcf field with spectroscopic redshifts  many of which are also uv - bright laes  and find similar two - component and exponential scalelengths of 7.5kpc and 5.8kpc , respectively .",
    "however , we note that the measurements for both uv bright laes and lbgs in the pcf sample are limited by a smaller number of galaxies , making the size measurements very uncertain .",
    "we carry out monte carlo realizations by randomly selecting subsets of lbgs and stacking them and find a large spread in the measured correlation lengths .",
    "in particular , some realizations only containing lbgs with ly@xmath0 in emission yield scalelengths as large as 12kpc , much larger than our formal best fit of 7.5kpc . a larger lbg sample is crucial to further test this possibility .    at the highest luminosities probed by both samples ( @xmath376 ) , the measured scalelengths are consistent with those reported by @xcite , although they found larger scalelengths towards lower luminosities of @xmath377@xmath378 . in figure",
    "[ fig : slen_prop ] , we also show the exponential scalelengths measured by s11 as green data points .",
    "different symbols represent their subsamples binned by the level of  emission or the estimated rest - frame ews , all of which are considerably more luminous than our samples .",
    "we note that @xcite used galaxy properties derived from a @xmath379 aperture to subdivide samples .",
    "the same photometry is adopted for the @xmath374 values of their subsamples , which we compared with .",
    "they may slightly underestimate the galaxy total uv luminosity .",
    "we find a positive correlation between lah size and ly@xmath0 luminosity , as evident in the left panel of figure[fig : slen_prop ] .",
    "a test using safe_correlate gives the null hypothesis probability of @xmath380 and @xmath381 for the pcf and lab samples , respectively .",
    "at the lowest ly@xmath0 luminosities ( @xmath382 ) , our measurements are once again fully consistent with the individual size measurements of @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite reported an opposite trend at low luminosities not probed by our samples : lah sizes decrease with increasing ly@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "most subsamples from s11 probe the highest luminosity regime at @xmath383 .",
    "their results show that the exponential scalelengths increase with ly@xmath0 luminosity , which is similar to our findings",
    ". however , their measured scalelengths are systematically larger than any other studies , which may reflect the fact that their galaxies are selected as lbgs and the majority of them are considerably more luminous in continuum emission .",
    "it is evident in figure  [ fig : slen_prop ] ( left ) that the observed trend is stronger if the two - component scalelengths @xmath95 are considered instead of the exponential ones @xmath91 in both cases .",
    "we investigate the cause of this difference , and find that the presence of strong compact ly@xmath0 emission in the central region ( presumably originating from the galaxy itself ) , can lead to an underestimation of _ exponential scalelengths_. we refer the readers interested in further details of this argument to appendix,[sec : psf_effect ]",
    ". on the other hand , two - component scalelengths should be largely unaffected as long as the psf effect on the global shape of the lah is properly taken into account .",
    "hence , it appears that the lah size depends sensitively on ly@xmath0 luminosities ; nearly doubling the characteristic size from the lowest to highest luminosity bin .",
    "we suspect that the lah size dependence on ly@xmath0 luminosity and on uv luminosity are likely connected .",
    "because the lae color selection criteria sets the minimum ly@xmath0 ew for any galaxy to be selected as an lae , more continuum luminous galaxies need to have higher ly@xmath0 luminosities to meet the criteria , thus creating an artificial positive correlation between the uv and ly@xmath0 luminosities ( figure  [ fig : pcflab_propc ] ; also see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , in our samples , the ly@xmath0 luminosities and uv continuum luminosities of individual galaxies are positively correlated albeit with large scatter as can be seen in the median values for different subsamples presented in tables  [ pcf_table ] and [ lab_table ] .",
    "these considerations suggest that the observed correlation with ly@xmath0 luminosities is at least in part influenced by this selection effect .",
    "no clear correlation between lah sizes and ly@xmath0 equivalent widths is found in our sample ( figure  [ fig : slen_prop ] , right ) .",
    "the null hypothesis probability reaches above @xmath384 for both pcf and lab samples . once again , our measured scalelengths are similar to those of @xcite , while generally lying below the values reported by @xcite and @xcite . the former observed a very weak trend of lower - ew galaxies having slightly larger halos ( 8.3  kpc and 10.5  kpc for the highest- and lowest - ew sample , respectively ) .",
    "the measurements from s11 populate the low end of the ew range as they are uv - luminous lbgs , and their large scalelengths likely reflect their high continuum luminosities .    based on the above considerations , we postulate that uv - bright galaxies are likely to have larger lahs , while ly@xmath0 luminosities and ews , which themselves correlate with uv luminosities , produce weaker correlations with the scalelengths .",
    "this interpretation is similar to that suggested by @xcite and @xcite , that the galaxies whose properties are closest to those of lyman - break galaxies appear to have the most extended ly@xmath0 halos .",
    "lbgs , compared to laes , generally have higher uv continuum luminosities , ews , and redder spectral slopes . in this scenario",
    ", the general discordance between different measurements can be partly explained : the @xcite measures lie lower than the most because their galaxies are the least uv luminous ; the very large scalelengths measured by s11 reflect the fact that their galaxies are much more continuum luminous than other samples .",
    "we note that the equivalent widths in our samples , measured individually and on average , are generally within the limit of the `` case b '' recombination dust - free assumption , i.e. , @xmath385  @xcite .",
    "although the subsamples with the strongest nb@xmath148bb color apparently show photometric ews exceeding @xmath386 , their uncertainties are significantly larger due to poor constrains on the uv continuum near @xmath387 .",
    "although our spectroscopic observations do not indicate agn contamination in our samples , it is possible that some galaxies in our samples may contain agn .",
    "the median - combination stacks we use should reject such sources as long as the majority of laes do not harbor agn .",
    "previous studies also suggest a relatively low agn contribution to the lae populatio at @xmath388 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , there is no clear evidence of other  generation mechanisms rather than the recombination radiation from star formation .",
    "apart from the fact that the resonant scattering nature of  photons provides a mechanism to produce extended lahs , there is no general consensus in the literature on the physical origin of the lah phenomenon .",
    "while there is no doubt that at least some  emission originates from the central star formation of the galaxy itself ,  photons emerging from the outer halo may still be contributed by multiple other sources : namely , star formation in satellite galaxies and diffuse gas around them ; and gravitational cooling radiation from infalling gas . their relative importance should sensitively depend on the total halo mass  which sets both the number of satellite galaxies and the rate of gas infall responsible for gravitational cooling radiation @xcite .",
    "however , different studies predict a wide range of ly@xmath0 halo luminosities resulting from gravitational cooling , even at a fixed halo mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this results from the diverse physical conditions in the gas and complexities of modeling the radiative transfer .",
    "while the strength and spatial distribution of different ionizing sources are critical to determine lah properties , their effectiveness are also related to the distribution and kinematics of gas and dust  which scatters and absorbs ly@xmath0 photons , respectively  in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d12 ) . viewing angles may also play an important in the lah appearance @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we compare our measurements with two recent models from d12 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l15 ) . together",
    ", these models bracket the two opposite ends of the possibilities .",
    "the first model , proposed by d12 , assumes that the central star formation as the sole power source of lahs .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are produced in the galaxy then propagate through an outflowing , cold , clumpy circumgalactic medium .",
    "the distribution and kinematics ( i.e. , outflow velocity field , hi column density , and degree of clumpiness as a function of galactocentric radius ) of the cgm is set to reproduce reproduce the @xmath389 halo structure derived using observations of qso absorption lines as a function of impact parameter @xcite .",
    "based on monte carlo simulations of radiative transfer for ly@xmath0 photons scattering through the cgm , d12 argued that significantly extended lahs may be produced if the velocity field of gas clouds reaches a maximum at @xmath390  kpc , beyond which clumps decelerate .",
    "their best model produces a clearly extended lah , but not as extended as that observed by s11 .",
    "in contrast to the d12 model , l15 takes into account all potential sources of ly@xmath0 production , including star formation from central and satellite galaxies , ly@xmath0 photons associated with diffuse uv background surrounding these galaxies , and gravitational cooling radiation . l15 simulated 9 laes at @xmath106 using an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation within a cosmological volume .",
    "this work re - simulates galaxies at higher resolution , reaching scales of @xmath3120pc and mass resolution of @xmath391 .",
    "they model the  emission from these haloes using the monte carlo radiative transfer code of @xcite , and create an average  surface brightness profile by combining the lah models of individual galaxies .",
    "each of the emergent ly@xmath0 photons is tagged according to its origin , which enables the authors to examine the relative importance of different components at different radii .",
    "l15 concluded that a significant fraction of their simulated lahs must come from off - center star formation or gravitational cooling ",
    "contributes roughly equally  as their ly@xmath0 profile from the central sf falls steeply .",
    "the surface brightness profile from l15 gives an impressively good fit to the @xcite measurements except that it slightly overpredicts at @xmath392  kpc .",
    "they further noted that the off - center sf may be suppressed because substantial sf in off - center locations would also lead to an extended uv continuum emission , which is not seen in the @xcite data .",
    "exclusion of off - center sf brings their model to an even better agreement with the observational measurement .",
    "the caveat of the d12 model is that it only considers photons arising from the central sf propagating through an outflowing medium , and ignores the possibility of an off - center sf and inflow of cold gas . on the other hand",
    ", l15 do not include the presence of an outflowing medium .",
    "the presence of ubiquitous outflows in high - z galaxies has been firmly established by observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and , as shown by d12 , significantly impacts the emergent  profiles .",
    "apart from velocity fields , these two models differ in the relative distribution of gas and dust ( clumpy vs smooth component ) at radii relevant for the lah phenomenon , although detailed discussions of these differences are beyond the scope of this paper .    keeping in mind the differences between these models , we proceed to compare them with the measured lah surface brightness profile . in figure",
    "[ fig : compmodels ] , we show the radial profile measurements for the full lae sample ( black ) and that for point - like sources ( gray ) in the pcf and lab field . the full l15 model , including central and off - center sf and gravitational cooling , is illustrated in solid blue line . two variants of their model , by excluding the off - center sf or including only the central sf , are presented as dashed or dotted line , respectively .",
    "the d12 model is shown in red solid line . as we are mainly interested in comparing the large - scale behavior and not in evaluating the mean equivalent widths measured ( assumed ) in different samples ( models ) , all curves are normalized at @xmath393  kpc .",
    "it must be noted that we have convolved the model predictions to match the psf broadening present in the data .",
    "the d12 model predicts a remarkably good fit to the pcf measurement at @xmath394@xmath395  kpc , but slightly underpredicts the lab profile , and declines with a shallower slope .",
    "the full model of l15 ( solid blue line ) overpredicts the surface brightness at @xmath392  kpc and also falls more gradually than the data . within the range @xmath393@xmath395  kpc ,",
    "our pcf sample is best described by their ` central sf only ' model while their model that includes gravitational cooling but without off - center sf ( dashed line : labeled ` without satellites ' in figure  [ fig : compmodels ] ) also lies well above our measurement .",
    "the lab profile lies somewhere between their ` central sf only ' model and ` without satellites ' model although the slope is more similar to the former .",
    "our results indicate that the measured profiles are very close to that expected from ly@xmath0 photons arising from central star formation then scattered out to large radii , leaving only a small room for possible contributions from off - center sf ( satellites and background diffuse sf ) and gravitational cooling .",
    "it is conceivable that the deficit of the l15 ` central - sf only ' model and our own measurements would be even smaller if they included an outflowing clumpy medium in their calculation , which in turn would result in broadening the central sf component .    at large galactocentric distances ( @xmath392  kpc ) , other mechanisms such as sf in satellites and gravitational cooling",
    "may contribute to the lah phenomenon although it is difficult to speculate which process may dominate . in principle , a large contribution from satellite sf would result in similarly extended halos in the uv continuum image .",
    "such a feature is not observed in our uv images although , similar to that discussed by @xcite , robust detection of the feature requires both exceedingly low surface brightness sensitivities and a better control on sky subtraction precision . in particular , the latter is difficult to achieve as sky background estimation inherently includes these low - sb sources typically leading to over - subtraction , rendering the stacked image to appear more compact than the intrinsic size .",
    "furthermore , a signal from off - center sources would be easily washed away by the median stacking method we adopted .",
    "better constraints may come from ultradeep nb observations which can resolve the morphologies of individual galaxies into compact or diffuse components .",
    "one useful clue may come from the observed correlation between scalelengths and galaxies physical properties .",
    "one clear correlation that emerged from our analysis is that more extended lahs are found around more uv - luminous galaxies .",
    "the trend may be explained in two different ways : first , the physical conditions ( the kinematics and distribution of gas and dust ) of more uv - luminous galaxies are more conducive to producing extended lahs ; and second , more uv - luminous galaxies  forming stars at higher rates ",
    "tend to be hosted by more massive halos @xcite which are more likely to have a satellite galaxy @xcite . in the latter scenario",
    ", it follows that galaxies in overdense environments are expected to have more pronounced ly@xmath0 halos in the average stack as , given everything else fixed , the likelihood of having a companion in proximity is enhanced by the factor that correlates with the overdensity parameter .",
    "if such a trend exists , it should have been observed in either of our samples as both fields contain highly significant galaxy overdensities .",
    "the complete lack of a trend between lah size and overdensity parameters ( as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] ) suggests that satellite populations are not the dominant contributor to the lah emission .",
    "interestingly , @xcite recently presented a detailed study of mrk  1486 , a local edge - on disk galaxy with a large lah .",
    "as a source with one of the highest measured ly@xmath0 luminosities and equivalent widths in the lars sample @xcite , mrk1486 also has physical properties ( stellar mass , age , sfr , and dust content ) similar to those of typical high - redshift laes @xcite . based on multiple line diagnostics , they concluded that ly@xmath0 photons are likely photoionized inside the disk then scattered in our direction by neutral gas in bipolar outflows .",
    "the physical picture presented by @xcite is qualitatively similar to ours and thus lends further support to our main conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we report robust detection of diffuse ly@xmath0 emission around high - redshift star - forming galaxies . taking advantage of two large spectroscopic / photometric samples of galaxies at @xmath89 and @xmath25 ,",
    "we have examined how the lah sizes correlate with the physical properties of galaxies , with rigorous tests of possible systematics in constructing stacked ly@xmath0 images and measuring lah characteristics .",
    "our main results are described as follows . +    1 .   in our full samples and",
    "most of our subsamples , the stacked  image is significantly more extended than the uv continuum image of the same galaxies and data point spread functions , unambiguously confirming the presence of diffuse ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "typical sizes of lahs in our samples are relatively modest at 48  kpc , in good agreement with recent measurements of individual galaxies @xcite . very large ( @xmath396  kpc ) lahs similar to those reported by @xcite are not detected .",
    "we examine how lah sizes  measured as an exponential scalelength  depend on galaxy properties : namely , uv luminosity , ly@xmath0 luminosity and equivalent widths , and local environment .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we find no correlation between lah size and local environment  measured in galaxy overdensity  even though both of our samples contain significantly overdense structures which will likely evolve to massive galaxy clusters by the present epoch .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is unclear .",
    "the strongest correlation is found with uv luminosity in our data .",
    "the same trend becomes even stronger when combined with other measurements in the literature .",
    "we conclude that the physical processes that drive lah sizes correlate strongly with galaxy s uv luminosity .",
    "the observed lah trends with other galaxy parameters may be driven by the fact that they themselves weakly correlate with uv luminosity .",
    "3 .   the measured scalelength  a characteristic scale with which an exponential function declines  should provide a reliable and robust metric to quantify an average lah .",
    "possible systematics inherent in the details of stacking procedure are examined by performing image stacking of an identical galaxy sample using a suite of methods bracketing various techniques employed in the existing literature .",
    "we compare the radial surface brightness profiles resulted from these methods , and find that while the overall amplitude of the profile is sensitive to the details of the adopted procedure , the overall shape is not .",
    "we compare the lah profiles measured in our data with recent theoretical predictions .",
    "a simple model in which ly@xmath0 photons originate from central star formation , then resonantly propagate outward in a clumpy outflowing medium , is in a reasonable agreement with our measurements .",
    "the implication is that other potential producers of ly@xmath0 photons , such as low - level star formation occurring in off - center locations and radiative cooling of collisionally heated hi gas ( gravitational cooling ) , may be at best minor contributors to the lah phenomenon .",

    "[ sec : defaultstack ] , a radial profile is measured from a `` contamination - free zero - sky '' image , which is constructed by estimating and subsequently subtracting sky background value from the stacked image itself . while this procedure does an excellent job ensuring that the pixels far from the central source are nearly background - free , the background value determined on the stacked image mildly fluctuates depending on the type of cutout images ( i.e. , _ repaired _ , _ masked _ , or _ original _ ) and the choice of image combination ( _ mean _ vs _ median _ ) .",
    "small uncertainties in sky background can alter the radial profile appearance especially in the low snr regions . however , we find that the measured scalelengths are insensitive to specific choice adopted for sky background estimation . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : bgcomplya ] , we show the @xmath95 values from our individual subsamples , using two different annular regions @xmath421[6 , 10 ] and @xmath421[10 , 15 ] to determine background levels .",
    "the former is adopted as our default method in this work .",
    "the comparison shows a good consistency in @xmath95 despite very different choices of the annular regions adopted for sky subtraction .",
    "we conclude that scalelength measurements offer a robust method to characterize radial profiles of diffuse ly@xmath0 emission than a comparison of the entire surface brightness profile shape .",
    "the latter is very sensitive to various systematics , namely , the manner in which image stacking and sky subtraction are performed , as well as the image psf , which is further discussed below .",
    "point spread functions with broad wings can significantly alter the observed shape of the ly@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . thus , the lah exponential scalelengths from directly fitting ly@xmath0 radial profiles ( eq .  [ eq : expo ] ) may be susceptible to the psf effect . in this appendix ,",
    "we use three toy models to illustrate the potential bias of this approach .    in our toy models , the  emission from a typical start - forming galaxy consists of two components as described in eq .  [ eq : twoc ] : a halo component following an exponential profile with a scalelength @xmath95 of 3 , 7 , or 12  kpc in three models , respectively ; and , a galaxy component modeled as exponentially declining with a scalelength of @xmath422  kpc ( a typical size of laes at our sample redshift ) .",
    "we define the halo - to - total ly@xmath0 fraction as : @xmath423 where @xmath424 denotes the total flux obtained by integrating the surface brightness profiles of the halo and galaxy component . in each of our models ,",
    "we vary the halo - to - total ly@xmath0 fraction from @xmath425% to 100% , with a ` halo - only ' assumption corresponding to @xmath426% .",
    "then we simulate the apparent ly@xmath0 radial profile by convolving intrinsic profiles from the toy models with with the psf measured from our lab dataset .",
    "we evaluate the results from single - component exponential fitting to various simulated galaxy+halo profiles , and compare it with the intrinsic halo scalelengths ( 3 , 7 , or 12kpc in three models , respectively ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stackmodelssim](a ) , we present the simulated  radial profiles with different halo - to - total ly@xmath0 fractions . in each panel , three halo models are shown in different colors .",
    "the halo - to - total ly@xmath0 fraction changes from 100% ( top right ) , 75% ( bottom left ) , to 25% ( bottom right ) . in the ` halo - only ' ( or @xmath427 ) model ,",
    "the observed profile of the compact lah model ( 3kpc ) closely follows the psf , as the light profile of a compact source is essentially determined by the psf . as for the 12  kpc lah model , on the other hand , the profile is virtually unaltered by the psf shape except within the central 5  kpc .",
    "thus , if all ly@xmath0 emission originates from an lah , the measured scalelengths should be relatively insensitive to a psf falling off more steeply than the lah .",
    "but if the intrinsic lah profile falls steeper than the psf , a direct fitting of the apparent  profile will lead to an overestimation of the lah scalelength as the result only effectively characterizes the psf shape . in more realistic scenarios of laes , some compact ly@xmath0 emission may originate from the galaxy itself , which makes the intrinsic profile deviate from a purely exponential one .",
    "the outcome is that the observed ly@xmath0 profile can be significantly altered even for relatively large lahs , as illustrated in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : stackmodelssim ] .",
    "while compact lah sources still resemble the psf at large radii , even the profiles of large lahs ( up to 12kpc here ) will appear to steepen .",
    "the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : stackmodelssim ] provide a simple explanation : the contribution from the compact ly@xmath0 emission , which resemble the psf , becomes dominant in the integrated  light profile .",
    "this leads to the underestimations of lah sizes .",
    "figure  [ fig : stackmodelssim](a ) illustrates the potential bias of using the single - component exponential fit results to characterize lah sizes . in figure",
    "[ fig : stackmodelssim](b ) , we show the derive quantitive values of @xmath428 from three toy models with varying halo - to - total ly@xmath0 fractions . based on the toy models and the realistic psf from our lab sample , the single - component scalelength values from eq .",
    "[ eq : twoc ] can be only used to characterize lah sizes when the halo appears to be broader than the actual psf ( @xmath429kpc ) and the compact  component is not dominant ( @xmath430 ) the result also shows that even if all galaxies have identical intrinsic lah sizes , varying @xmath431 parameter from 1 ( lbg - like galaxies with no compact ly@xmath0 emission ) to 0.2 ( galaxies with prominent ly@xmath0 emission in centers ) will decrease the estimated scalelength in a single - component exponential fitting .",
    "this effect is indeed visible in several high uv/-luminosity subsamples ( see tables[pcf_table ] and [ lab_table ] ) and figure  [ fig : slen_prop ] , where the estimated scalelength from single - component fitting is lower .",
    "however , as the apparent light profile slope approach the slope in the psf outer wings ( an equivalent of scale - length @xmath432kpc ) , the values of @xmath91 overestimate the intrinsic lah scalelengths .    without the details of actual psf in stacking images from previous studies , we are unable to quantify how significant this artificial effect could be",
    ". however , our simulation does suggest that one needs to exercise caution when interpreting the lah scalengthes measured from different methods and how it the values changes with galaxy properties . for a simple scenario that all lahs have the same scalelengths and the halo - to - total ly@xmath0 fraction is anti - correlated with the galaxy  lumoniisty",
    ", we could expect an anti - correlation between the measured @xmath91 and @xmath433 as we saw in @xcite .",
    "we note that the above bias would be less significant if the actual psf can be approximated as a gaussian function with less power in large radii . in the top",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig : stackmodelssim](a ) , we show a gaussian profile with the same fwhm value as the actual homogenized psf in the lab field .",
    "realistically , the resulting homogenized psfs in both of our datasets are approximated by moffat profiles with @xmath434 , which is typical in ground - based imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the psf homogenization of individual galaxy images is not designed to precisely match the psf shape before stacking and a simplified gaussian convolving kernel is adopted , the effective psf in stacking images will be poorly constrained beyond its fwhm .",
    "comparisons of different subsamples in the lah properties can be also precarious ."
