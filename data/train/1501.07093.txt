    "the physicians would like to assess the risk of the patients having a severe clinical event such as stroke or heart attack and predict the same if possible .",
    "some of the major known risk factors that eventually lead to the development of atherosclerosis are as follows : ( i ) family history of premature coronary heart disease or stoke in a first degree relative under the age of @xmath11 , ( ii ) tobacco abuse , ( iii ) type ii diabetes , ( iv ) high blood pressure , ( v ) left ventricular hypertrophy , ( vi ) high triglycerides , ( vii ) high low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol ( viii ) low high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , ( ix ) high total cholesterol",
    ". large number of factors influence the onset of atherosclerosis making it a difficult task for the physicians to diagnose in its early stages .",
    "though main risk factors are identified , development of automated effective risk prediction models using data mining techniques becomes essential for better health monitoring and prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases  @xcite .",
    "establishing a diagnostic procedure for early detection of atherosclerosis disease is very important as any delay would increase the risk of serious complications or even disability .",
    "determining the conditions ( risk factors ) predisposing the development of atherosclerosis can lead to tests for identifying the disease in its early stages .",
    "though the clinical risk factors of chd are identified there is a need for additional understanding on the disease progression for effective management  @xcite .",
    "researchers have been focusing on techniques for quantifying atherosclerosis plaque morphology , composition , mechanical forces etc . , hoping for better patient screening procedures .",
    "imaging of atherosclerotic plaques helps in both diagnosis and monitoring of the progression for future management  @xcite .",
    "there are two modes of imaging atherosclerosis ( i ) invasive and ( ii ) non - invasive . among the invasive methods x - ray angiography is the gold standard imaging technique even though it has certain limitations in providing information on plaque composition  @xcite .",
    "the invasive procedures such as intravascular ultrasound ( ivus )  @xcite and angioscopy  @xcite help in understanding the plaque size and to a limited extent its composition . the intravascular thermography  @xcite aids in monitoring the changes in plaque composition and metabolism",
    ". the non - invasive procedures such as b - mode ultrasound  @xcite , computerized tomography ( ct )  @xcite and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri )  @xcite , can provide information on plaque composition on vascular beds but they fail to throw much light on the metabolic activity of the plaque inflammatory cells . though nuclear imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) and positron emission tomography ( pet )  @xcite have the potential for 2d and 3d surface reconstruction of thrombus using radio labels to provide information on molecular , cellular and metabolic activity of plaques  @xcite , they lack the required resolution , sensitivity for detection and functional assessment in medium to small size arteries found in coronary circulation .",
    "keeping in view the limitations of the imaging techniques there is still a greater need for developing automated methods for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis disease in individuals which would be of great help in reducing the disease related deaths .",
    "machine learning approaches have been employed in a variety of real world problems to extract knowledge from data for predictive tasks .",
    "the presence of large number of attributes in medical databases affects the decision making process as some of the factors may be redundant or irrelevant . also , the presence of missing values and highly skewed value distributions in the attributes of medical datasets require development of new preprocessing strategies .",
    "feature selection methods are aimed at identifying feature subsets to construct models that can best describe the dataset .",
    "the other advantages in using feature selection methods include : identifying and removing of redundant / irrelevant features  @xcite , reducing the dimensionality of the dataset , and improving the predictive capability of the classifier .",
    "the present study attempts to identify risk factors causing atherosclerosis and the possible risk that the individuals are running at .    in view of the above challenges , we present the following novel features of our work :    * identifying the missing values ( mv ) in the dataset and imputing them by using a newly developed non - parametric imputation procedure ;",

    "this paper is organized as follows : a brief survey of the state - of - the - art techniques employed in predicting the risk factors and understanding the biology of atherosclerosis is discussed in section  [ review ] , while in section  [ chap8:sec1 ] we discuss a novel methodology for predicting the clinical risk factors of atherosclerosis .",

    "a correlation based feature selection with c4.5 decision tree is applied  @xcite for risk prediction of cardiovascular disease .",
    "recent developments in imaging methods for diagnosis have given new insights on the molecular and metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques  @xcite .",
    "there are many other studies wherein machine learning techniques have also been employed for predicting the risk of chd due to atherosclerosis using ultrasound and other imaging methods  @xcite .",
    "community based studies help in understanding the risk factors of atherosclerosis in different social strata  @xcite .    in the above studies the missing values ( mv ) were either deleted  @xcite , or filled with approximate values  @xcite .",
    "a windowing method was employed  @xcite for obtaining the aggregates of the attributes for imputation of mvs .",
    "these approaches would lead to biased estimates and may either reduce or exaggerate the statistical power .",
    "methods such as logistic regression , maximum likelihood and expectation maximization have been employed for imputation of mv , but they can be applied only on data sets that are either nominal or numeric .",
    "there are other imputation methods such as k - nearest neighbor imputation ( knni )  @xcite ; k - means clustering imputation ( kmi )  @xcite ; weighted k - nearest neighbor imputation ( wknni )  @xcite and fuzzy k - means clustering imputation ( fkmi )  @xcite .",
    "the mean value imputation proposed by sree hari rao and naresh kumar  @xcite can be employed only when the attribute values are normally distributed . in case of highly skewed attribute values the above method may result in biased estimates as mean value is not a true representative of a non - normal distribution .",
    "motivated by the above issues we propose a methodology comprising of a novel nonparametric missing value imputation method that can be applied on ( i ) data sets consisting of attributes that are of the type categorical ( nominal ) and/or numeric ( integer or real ) , and ( ii ) attribute values that belong to highly skewed distribution . the methodology proposed by freud and mason",
    "@xcite ignores missing values while generating the decision tree , which renders lower prediction accuracies . in this paper",
    "we propose a new feature subset selection methodology where in , a particle optimization search ( pso ) is wrapped around an alternating decision tree ( adt ) embedded with new imputation strategy discussed in  section  [ chap9:rni ] , for generation of effective decision rules .",
    "this methodology can predict the diagnosis of chd in real time .",
    "in fact the decision rules obtained by employing this novel methodology will be useful to diagnose other individuals based on their risk factors .",
    "we designate the present machine learning approach as predictive risk assessment of atherosclerosis ( @xmath12 ) methodology throughout this work .",
    "we adopt the procedure suggested by sree hari rao and naresh kumar  @xcite for building and evaluating the classification model using an adt .",
    "a medical dataset can be represented as a set _ s _ having row vectors @xmath13 and column vectors @xmath14 .",
    "each record can be represented as an ordered n - tuple of clinical and laboratory attributes @xmath15 for each @xmath16 where the last attribute @xmath17 for each _ i _ , represents the physician s diagnosis to which the record @xmath18 belongs and without loss of generality we assume that there are no missing elements in this set .",
    "each attribute of an element in _",
    "s _ that is @xmath19 for @xmath16 and @xmath20 can either be a categorical ( nominal ) or numeric ( real or integer ) type .",
    "clearly all the sets considered are finite sets .",
    "the first step in any imputation algorithm is to compute the proximity measure in the feature space among the clinical records to identify the nearest neighbors from where the values can be imputed .",
    "the most popular metric for quantifying the similarity between any two records is the euclidean distance .",
    "though this metric is simpler to compute , it is sensitive to the scales of the features involved .",
    "further it does not account for correlation among the features .",
    "also , the categorical variables can only be quantified by counting measures which calls for the development of effective strategies for computing the similarity  @xcite .",
    "considering these factors we first propose a new indexing measure @xmath21 between two typical elements @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xmath25 belonging to the column @xmath26 of _ s _ which can be applied on any type of data , be it categorical ( nominal ) and/or numeric ( real ) .",

    "<S> the identification of risk factors helps in stratifying patients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary angiography . </S>",
    "<S> we present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis with an in - built imputation algorithm and particle swarm optimization ( pso ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the performance of our methodology with other machine learning techniques on stulong dataset which is based on longitudinal study of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years . </S>",
    "<S> our methodology powered by pso search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk factor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known factors . </S>",
    "<S> the decision rules extracted by our methodology are able to predict the risk factors with an accuracy of @xmath0 which is higher than the accuracies obtained by application of the state - of - the - art machine learning techniques presently being employed in the identification of atherosclerosis risk studies .    </S>",
