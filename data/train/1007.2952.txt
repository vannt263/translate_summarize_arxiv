    "quantum information processing allows us to solve problems that we are not able to solve in the classical world at all or at least that we are not able to solve efficiently .",
    "this is true also in the field of communication complexity .",
    "the first convincing evidence that quantum communication protocols can be more efficient than classical ones was given in 1998 by buhrman , cleve and wigderson @xcite .",
    "they found a problem whose quantum communication complexity is exponentially better than classical communication complexity in the error - free model .",
    "one year later , raz proposed a problem for which this exponential separation holds also in the bounded - error model @xcite .",
    "since quantum entanglement provides us with strong non - local correlations , one can ask whether it can be used even to completely eliminate the need for communication .",
    "of course , we are interested only in such problems for which this does not hold in the classical world . on one hand , the answer is negative if we consider the standard communication complexity model @xcite in which parties compute a value of some function on their inputs and the whole result of the computation must become known to at least one party .",
    "otherwise , faster - than - light communication would be possible which would contradict the relativity theory .",
    "on the other hand , if each party has its own input , computes its own output and we are interested only in non - local correlations between the inputs and the outputs , then the answer is positive . such problems are often described using a terminology of the game theory and they are usually called pseudo - telepathy games .    apart from the fact that they can be seen as distributed problems which can be solved without any form of direct communication between the parties , there is one more reason to be interested in pseudo - telepathy games .",
    "they offer an alternative way to show that the physical world is not _",
    "local realistic _",
    ", the result which is usually proved using some form of the bell inequality @xcite .",
    "_ locality _ means that no action performed at a location @xmath0 can have an instantenous ( faster than light ) effect at a remote location @xmath1 .",
    "_ realism _ means that every characteristic about the physical system that can be measured is already determined before the actual measurement .",
    "therefore , we can say that it exists independently of the measurement .",
    "unfortunately , the bell inequality is not very easy to explain because it involves nontrivial probabilistic arguments .",
    "it would be very convenient if we could demonstrate an observable behaviour which is obviously impossible in the classical world .",
    "pseudo - telepathy games are of interest because some of them are very simple and one can explain that there is no classical winning strategy for them in several minutes almost to anyone .    in order to be able to describe what a pseudo - telepathy game is ,",
    "we explain at first what we mean by the term two party game . a _ two party game _",
    "@xmath2 is a sextuple @xmath3 where @xmath4 are _ input sets _ , @xmath5 are _ output sets _ , @xmath6 is a subset of @xmath7 known as a _ promise _ and @xmath8 is a relation among the input sets and the output sets which is called a _ winning condition_. before the game begins , the parties , usually called alice and bob , are allowed to discuss strategy and exchange any amount of classical information , including values of random variables . they may also share an unlimited amount of quantum entanglement .",
    "afterwards , alice and bob are separated from each other and they are not able to communicate any more till the end of the game . in one _ round of the game _ , alice is given an input @xmath9 and she is required to produce an output @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , bob is given an input @xmath11 and he is required to produce an output @xmath12 .",
    "the pairs @xmath13 and @xmath14 are called a _",
    "question _ and an _ answer _",
    ", respectively .",
    "we say that alice and bob _ win the round _ if either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "alice and bob _ win the game _ if they have won all the rounds of it .",
    "a _ strategy _ of alice and bob is said to be _ winning _ if it always allows them to win .",
    "we say that a two - party game is _ pseudo - telepathic _ if there is no classical winning strategy , but there is a winning strategy , provided alice and bob share entanglement . the origin of this term can be explained in the following way .",
    "suppose that scientists who know nothing about quantum computing witness alice and bob playing some pseudo - telepathy game .",
    "more precisely , suppose that the players are very far from each other , they are given their inputs at the same time and have to produce their outputs in time shorter than time required by light to trave1 between them .",
    "if alice and bob answer correctly in a sufficiently long sequence of rounds , the scientists will conclude that alice and bob can communicate somehow . but",
    "according to classical physics , communication between the players is impossible .",
    "therefore , the scientists will be made to believe that alice and bob are able to communicate in the way unknown to classical physics .",
    "now , one of possible explanations will be that the players are endowed with telepathic powers .",
    "a survey of pseudo - telepathy games can be found in @xcite .",
    "the definition of these games can be easily generalized to more than two players .    a classical strategy @xmath17 for a pseudo - telepathy game @xmath2 is _ deterministic _ if there are functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that for each question @xmath20 , the only possible answer of alice and bob is the pair @xmath21 .",
    "the _ success _ @xmath22 of a deterministic strategy @xmath17 is defined as the proportion of questions from the promise @xmath6 for which @xmath17 produces a correct answer .",
    "clearly , this number can by interpreted as the probability that the strategy @xmath17 succeeds on a given question which is chosen uniformly and randomly .",
    "we denote with @xmath23 the maximal success of a deterministic strategy for the game @xmath2 : @xmath24    alice and bob can also use a classical randomized strategy for @xmath2 .",
    "any randomized strategy can be seen as a probability distribution over a finite set of deterministic strategies .",
    "therefore , if questions are chosen uniformly and randomly , the probability of winning the game @xmath2 using a randomized strategy can not be greater than @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this paper examines how successful classical players can be at the matching game .",
    "this game is described in the next section .",
    "classical winning strategies for inputs of size 4 and for inputs of size 6 are proposed in section 3 . in section 4 , we show that there is no classical winning strategy if the input size is greater than 6 .",
    "the matching game is the youngest member of the family of pseudo - telepathy games .",
    "it was proposed by buhrman and kerenidis in 2004 @xcite .",
    "a perfect matching @xmath25 on the set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is even , is a partition of this set into @xmath28 sets , each of cardinality 2 .",
    "we define @xmath29 as the set of all perfect matchings on @xmath26 .",
    "alice receives a bit string @xmath30 and bob receives a perfect matching @xmath31 . the task for alice is to output a string @xmath32 .",
    "the task for bob is to output a set @xmath33 and a string @xmath34 .",
    "the players win the round if and only if @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the exclusive - or operator is applied on bits on the left side of the equation and is applied bit - wise on bit strings on the right side .",
    "the bit string @xmath38 is a binary representation of the number @xmath39 in which the most significant bit of @xmath39 is preceded by @xmath40 zero bits where @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the bit string @xmath42 is a binary representation of the number @xmath43 .",
    "a formal definition of the matching game is given in table [ tab.1 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab.1 ]    a quantum winning strategy for the matching game and also the proof that it always succeeds can be found in @xcite .",
    "the proof of the non - existence of a classical winning strategy for the matching game is based on the exponential separation between quantum and classical one - way communication complexity of the hidden matching problem @xcite .",
    "the above asymptotic result tells us only that for large enough inputs , there is no classical winning strategy for the matching game . but to be able to perform practical experiments , it is important to know exactly the smallest size of inputs with this property . obviously , there is a classical winning strategy for @xmath46 because there is only one perfect matching on the set @xmath47 .",
    "we propose classical winning strategies both for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these strategies are both obtained as a straightforward consequence of the following lemma which tells us that for each input size , there is a classical strategy which is winning if we properly restrict the set of questions alice and bob can be given .    for a positive integer @xmath27 ,",
    "we denote with @xmath48 the set @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be an even integer .",
    "suppose that alice is given an input @xmath30 and that bob s",
    "input @xmath51 contains a pair @xmath52 .",
    "if alice outputs the string @xmath53 and bob outputs the pair @xmath54 , the players will win .",
    "[ lem.1 ]    there is a classical winning strategy for the matching game for @xmath44 and also for @xmath45 .",
    "this section investigates whether there is a classical winning strategy for the matching game for @xmath55 .",
    "the task is carried out using some pieces of knowledge from the graph theory .",
    "therefore , we begin this section with several necessary definitions regarding graphs and their properties .",
    "a ( undirected ) graph @xmath2 is an ordered pair @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a set of vertices and @xmath58 is a set of two - element sets of vertices .",
    "these sets are called edges .",
    "let @xmath59 be a graph .",
    "a path in @xmath2 is a sequence @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a non - negative integer , of mutually different vertices such that for each @xmath62 , it holds that @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a graph .",
    "the distance @xmath64 of vertices @xmath65 in @xmath2 is the smallest number @xmath61 for which there is a path @xmath60 in @xmath2 such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath56 , @xmath68 be graphs .",
    "we say that @xmath69 is a subgraph of @xmath2 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 is said to be an induced subgraph of @xmath2 if for any vertices @xmath72 , it holds that @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a graph and let @xmath68 be its induced subgraph such that @xmath75 .",
    "we say that @xmath69 is a connected component ( or only component ) in @xmath2 if the following two conditions hold simultaneously :    1 .",
    "there are no vertices @xmath76 and @xmath77 such that @xmath74 , 2 .   for any vertices @xmath72",
    ", there is a path @xmath60 in @xmath69 such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a graph .",
    "we say that @xmath2 has cardinality ( has size ) @xmath61 if @xmath78 .",
    "now we will proceed in the following way . at first",
    ", we assign to each classical deterministic winning strategy @xmath17 a set of bit strings of length @xmath27 and a set of subsets of cardinality 2 of the set @xmath79 .",
    "then we examine properties of these sets and show that for @xmath55 such sets can not exist .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath55 , there is no classical deterministic winning strategy .",
    "since by fixing random variables we can turn any classical randomized winning strategy into a deterministic one , this means that there is no classical winning strategy at all .",
    "let @xmath17 be any classical deterministic strategy for the matching game for some @xmath27 .",
    "we define a graph @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the set of all elements of the set @xmath83 which bob produces as a part of at least one of his outputs using the strategy @xmath17 .",

    "let @xmath56 be a graph and let @xmath91 be a function .",
