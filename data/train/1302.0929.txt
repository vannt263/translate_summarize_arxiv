    "the origin of the most neutron - rich ( n - rich ) stable isotope among the iron - group nuclei and lighter elements , @xmath0ca , remains a long - standing mystery of nucleosynthesis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the historical background ) .",
    "@xmath0ca constitutes only 0.187% of the solar calcium abundance @xcite , but is 47 times more abundant than its next heavier stable isotope , @xmath5ca . from the point of view of nuclear stability , this can be attributed to the doubly magic structure of @xmath0ca with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thermal equilibrium , such as nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) or quasi - nuclear equilibrium ( qse ) , thus seems to be responsible for the creation of @xmath0ca , in which each isotopic abundance is a strong function of its binding energy per nucleon .",
    "such a formation of @xmath0ca demands a highly n - rich environment with @xmath8 ( number of protons per nucleon ) being close to that characterizing the structure of @xmath0ca , @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite suggested n - rich nse as the production mechanism of @xmath0ca , based on the assumption that such conditions would be met in the innermost ejecta of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "@xcite argued , however , that qse was responsible for the creation of @xmath0ca .",
    "they showed that a low - entropy environment , characterized by @xmath10 , led to the appreciable creation of @xmath0ca , where @xmath11 is the photon - to - nucleon ratio with @xmath12 being the temperature in @xmath13  k and @xmath14 the matter density in @xmath15  g  @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason , @xcite concluded that ccsne were excluded as the origin of @xmath0ca because of their high entropies ( @xmath17 ) in the neutrino - driven ejecta .",
    "such a high @xmath18 leads to an @xmath19-rich freezeout from nse @xcite followed by qse , in which nuclear stability prefers heavier nuclei than @xmath0ca .",
    "instead , they concluded type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) as the unique site that could achieve such low @xmath18 environments . @xcite",
    "explored sn  ia models with a central density of ( 4@xmath20  g  @xmath16 ( needed to obtain @xmath210.42 ) , which was substantially higher than the typical values of about @xmath22  g  @xmath16 .",
    "he found the production of @xmath0ca/@xmath23fe to be about 100 times larger than its solar ratio .",
    "given the observational fact that about one half of the galactic iron comes from sne  ia @xcite , @xcite estimated an event rate of such high - density explosions no more than a few percent of the observed sne  ia rate .    in this letter , we propose that electron - capture sne ( ecsne ) , a sub - class of ccsne arising from collapsing o - ne - mg cores , can be additional sites of @xmath0ca production .",
    "a recent two - dimensional ( 2d ) , self - consistent simulation of an ecsn predicts the ejection of n - rich matter of @xmath210.42 with @xmath24 ( @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these entropies , or @xmath25 , are only slightly above the limit of the criterion for @xmath0ca formation considered by @xcite .",
    "we utilize this ecsn model (   2 ) for nucleosynthesis calculations and discuss the production mechanism of @xmath0ca (   3 ) .",
    "the mass - integrated nucleosynthetic yields are then compared with the solar abundances to test if our ecsn model accounts for the @xmath0ca abundance in the solar inventory (   4 ) .",
    "the nucleosynthesis analysis makes use of about 2000 representative tracer particles , by which the thermodynamic histories of ejecta chunks were followed in our self - consistent 2d hydrodynamic calculation of an ecsn @xcite .",
    "the model was computed with a ray - by - ray - plus treatment of the energy - dependent neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "the pre - collapse model of the o - ne - mg core emerged from the evolution of an @xmath26 star @xcite . in our model , a neutrino - powered explosion sets in at about 100  ms after core bounce with an energy of about @xmath27  erg @xcite .",
    "because of the very steep density gradient near the core surface , an interesting amount of n - rich matter with relatively low entropy ( @xmath28@xmath29 for @xmath30 ) gets ejected ( figure  [ fig : yedms ] ; top ) , @xmath31 , and @xmath18 are those evaluated at @xmath32 throughout this paper . ] .",
    "this happens only in the multi - dimensional case , which allows for the rapid expansion of neutrino - heated gas in buoyant , mushroom - like plumes , whose expansion is too rapid for @xmath33 and @xmath34 absorptions to lift @xmath8 to values closer to 0.5 , in contrast to the 1d case or more massive fe - core progenitors , where the ejecta expansion is much slower and neutrino absorption proceeds longer .",
    "the entropies are lower for the lower @xmath8 particles as a result of less neutrino energy deposition .",
    "the photon - to - nucleon ratios ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yedms ] ; bottom ) are approximately one - tenth of the entropies , showing however a slightly steeper gradient for @xmath30 .",
    "the expansion timescales of the particles , defined as the @xmath35-folding time of the temperature drop below 0.5  mev , are @xmath36100  ms and are largely independent of @xmath8 .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields are obtained with the reaction network code described in @xcite by employing the latest reaction library of reaclib v2.0 @xcite . using thermodynamic trajectories directly from the ecsn model ,",
    "the calculations are started when the temperature decreases to @xmath37 , assuming initially free protons and neutrons with mass fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ( @xmath38 is the value at @xmath40 ) .",
    "the final mass fractions of @xmath0ca for the tracer particles in the range of @xmath41 are shown as a function of @xmath8 by red dots in the upper - panel of figure  [ fig : yeca48 ] .",
    "we find appreciable production of @xmath0ca in the range below its @xmath42 ( dashed line ) , peaking at @xmath43 replaced by even lower values result in the drop - off of @xmath44 around @xmath45 . ] .",
    "@xmath0ca is always made as itself , its double - magic nature affording a special degree of stability in nuclear equilibrium .    to examine the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0ca in detail ,",
    "let us pick a representative tracer particle with @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49  ms .",
    "note that the @xmath8 is slightly greater than @xmath50 as a result of neutrino reactions and the @xmath19-effect @xcite .",
    "the abundances ( defined by @xmath51 ; number per nucleon ) of n , p , @xmath19 , heavy nuclei ( @xmath52 ) , and @xmath0ca are displayed as a function of descending temperature in panel of figure  [ fig : tabun ] ( upper - left ) .",
    "we find that the abundance of heavy nuclei is fixed around @xmath53 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the 3-body reactions @xmath54c ( hereafter @xmath55 ) and @xmath56be followed by @xmath57be@xmath58c@xmath59 ( hereafter @xmath60 ) become slow as the matter expands .",
    "the @xmath19-consumption timescale , @xmath61 evaluated by @xmath55 , first exceeds @xmath62 at @xmath63 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the gateway from light to heavy nuclei is closed when the timescale @xmath64 evaluated by @xmath60 as well exceeds @xmath62 ( @xmath65 ; long - short - dashed line ) . in general",
    ", nse freezes between the @xmath55 and @xmath60 freezeouts .",
    "we define the nse - freezeout temperature ( @xmath53 ; long - dashed line ) at which the timescale of heavy abundance formation , @xmath66 , exceeds @xmath62 .",
    "once the nse freezes , the number of heavy nuclei in qse can not decrease because of their net photodisintegration being too slow @xcite .",
    "the fixed number of heavy nuclei is in fact the key condition of qse .",
    "we find that the transition from nse to qse takes place with the number of @xmath19 s slightly greater than that of heavy nuclei .",
    "the abundances become redistributed by absorptions of light nuclei , ; see   4 in * ? ? ?",
    "note also that @xmath19 s are in nuclear equilibrium with free nucleons throughout the qse phase .",
    "all n , p , @xmath19 thus play roles for readjustment of the qse abundances . ]",
    "decreasing the abundance of @xmath0ca and increasing the abundances of heavier nuclei in the qse cluster ( figure  [ fig : sabun ] ) . in the late qse phase ( @xmath674 ) , however , the @xmath0ca abundance recovers in response to a drop - off of the @xmath19 abundance .",
    "the number of charged light nuclei becomes insufficient to transmute @xmath0ca into heavier nuclei .",
    "the abundance redistribution is predominantly due to photodisintegration and n - absorption , which can not make a net upward shift in @xmath68 . instead , @xmath0ca increases in the local equilibrium around its double - magic intersection , lasting until the freezeout from qse at @xmath69 .",
    "in the end , however , the most abundant isotope is @xmath70zn , the daughter of p - magic @xmath70ni ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sabun ] ) .    how can we keep @xmath0ca increasing in the qse phase ? obviously , the presence of @xmath19 s is the cause of shifting light qse abundances toward a greater @xmath68 in the above case .",
    "we thus test the sensitivity of the @xmath0ca production to entropy , the key quantity that controls the @xmath19 abundance .",
    "figure  [ fig : tabun ] gives the results in which densities are divided by 1.3 ( upper - right ) or multiplied by 2.0 ( lower - left ) , 10 ( lower - right ) throughout the calculations for the same tracer particle .",
    "the @xmath18 s ( and roughly @xmath31 s ) decrease or increase by the inverse of the density scaling factor in each case .",
    "we find that the `` @xmath71 '' case ( @xmath72 ) leads to nse freezeout with appreciably abundant @xmath19 s compared to heavy nuclei ( hereafter @xmath19-rich qse ; @xmath73 ) . in this condition ,",
    "light nuclei are so abundant that the @xmath0ca abundance continuously decreases .",
    "in contrast , for the `` @xmath74 '' case ( @xmath75 ) , the nse freezes with a smaller @xmath19 abundance that is comparable to that of heavy nuclei ( hereafter @xmath19-poor qse ; @xmath76)ca survives . ] .",
    "such low levels of charged light nuclei allow @xmath0ca to continuously increase during qse and even after the qse freezeout by @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , it is the most abundant isotope in the end ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sabun ] ) . the `` @xmath78 '' case ( @xmath79 )",
    "gives a limiting condition of @xmath19-poor qse , resulting in a robust @xmath0ca creation .",
    "figure  [ fig : sabun ] displays the final abundances for the same cases and those relative the `` @xmath78 '' case . from the lower panel , it is clearly seen that a more @xmath19-rich qse tends to shift more abundances from lighter to heavier mass numbers .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that @xmath19-poor qse is the mechanism for making @xmath0ca as suggested by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : yeca48 ] ( top ) shows the result of sensitivity tests with various density scaling factors for all the tracer particles .",
    "overall , the synthesis of @xmath0ca is quite sensitive to entropy ( or @xmath18 ) in the range @xmath80 as shown in @xcite . in the explored range ,",
    "@xmath0ca is more robustly produced in the more n - rich environment , @xmath81 .",
    "as an example , the particles with @xmath82 in the `` @xmath71 '' case have similar @xmath0ca abundances to those of the unchanged case with @xmath83 , despite larger @xmath18 s for the former ( @xmath84 ) than the latter ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath60 reaction more rapid in more n - rich matter @xcite , leading to a faster consumption of @xmath19 s .",
    "it is important to note , however , that @xmath0ca is nowhere the most overproduced isotope ( i.e. , with the greatest @xmath86 ) in the explored range of our unchanged model as shown in figure  [ fig : yeca48 ] ( bottom ) . for @xmath87 , @xmath88se or @xmath89kr",
    "are generally the most overproduced isotopes . only the `` @xmath90 '' and `` @xmath78 '' cases ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath91 , lead to the production of @xmath0ca as the most overproduced isotope over a certain range in @xmath8 . in summary ,",
    "the physical conditions of our ecsn model lie in the transition region between the @xmath19-rich ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath19-poor ( @xmath92 ) qses ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "to examine whether ecsne can be significant producers of @xmath0ca in the galaxy , the final abundances are obtained by mass integration over all the tracer particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : pfiso ] ( upper - left ) gives the isotopic mass fractions ( after all radioactivities have decayed ) relative to their solar values @xcite , i.e. , the `` production factors '' , as a function of mass number for our unchanged model . the `` normalization band '' between the maximum ( 352 for @xmath93kr ) and one - tenth of that is indicated in yellow with the medium marked by a dashed line . isotopes that fall into this band can be accepted as being made in considerable amounts by ecsne . a reasonable `` flatness '' of production factors can be seen between @xmath94 and 90 , in which many isotopes fall into the normalization band .",
    "@xmath0ca ( shown by asterisk ) is however located slightly below the normalization band .",
    "this implies that ecsne contribute to the production of @xmath0ca no more than 10% of its solar content .    as explored in ",
    "[ sec : ca48 ] , the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0ca is highly sensitive to entropy and our unchanged model appears to lie in the edge of the @xmath19-poor qse condition . as a sensitivity test to entropy ,",
    "the mass - integrated production factors for `` @xmath95 '' , `` @xmath90 '' , and `` @xmath78 '' are also displayed in the upper - right , lower - left , and lower - right panels of figure  [ fig : pfiso ] , respectively .",
    "the result of `` @xmath95 '' satisfies the condition of @xmath0ca being in the middle of the normalization band , which means that the model can accounts for one - third of @xmath0ca in the solar system . in order to fully account for the origin of @xmath0ca",
    ", one needs to increase the densities ( that is equivalent to reduce @xmath18 s ) by a factor of two ( fig .  [ fig : pfiso ] ; lower - left ) .",
    "the reduced entropies lead to @xmath19-poor qse conditions in a broad range of @xmath8 , in which @xmath0ca is copiously produced ( figure  [ fig : yeca48 ] ; top ) .",
    "in fact , it is the most overproduced isotope for @xmath96 in this case ( figure  [ fig : yeca48 ] ; bottom ) . @xmath97ti and @xmath98cr , the isotopes made in @xmath19-poor qse",
    ", are also enhanced .",
    "the change here corresponds to a reduction of the entropies from @xmath99 to @xmath100 or @xmath101 in the range @xmath30 .",
    "this does not seem to be an extreme assumption , although the reduced values tend to scratch the lower end of the range of entropies that are compatible with neutrino - heated ejecta of ecsne or ccsne . in the limiting case of `` @xmath78 '' ,",
    "@xmath0ca remains the most overproduced isotope , although it is not much increased from the `` @xmath90 '' case .",
    "this is a consequence of robust @xmath0ca production for @xmath10 as proved in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the result in this case resembles to that of high - density sn  ia by @xcite .",
    "isotopes made in @xmath19-rich qse , such as @xmath102zn , @xmath103ge , @xmath104se , and @xmath105kr are all depleted and a reasonable flatness of production factors can not be seen .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0ca also depends on @xmath62 . in principle",
    ", a slower expansion leads to a later freezeout from nse and , consequently , leads to @xmath19-poor qse more easily .",
    "such a consequence , however , is not the case in our ecsn model .",
    "more slowly expanding matter would be exposed to neutrino absorptions for a longer time , shifting @xmath8 toward higher values as a result of the @xmath19-effect .",
    "such a @xmath8 increase would compensate the benefits of a slower expansion .",
    "one may also consider to increase the ejecta masses where @xmath0ca is richly produced ( @xmath430.42 ) .",
    "in fact , fine details of the @xmath8-@xmath106 distribution could well depend on the spatial resolution in the simulation or on other factors .",
    "it is not plausible , however , to enhance @xmath0ca without others in our unchanged model . as found in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : yeca48 ] ,",
    "the most overproduced isotope in the range @xmath30 is generally @xmath88se or @xmath89kr that already lie on the normalization band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfiso ] ; upper - left ) .",
    "we studied the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0ca using the thermodynamic trajectories of a self - consistent 2d explosion model of an ecsn @xcite .",
    "appreciable production of @xmath0ca was found in @xmath19-poor qse conditions .",
    "comparisons of the mass - integrated yields with the solar abundances show underproduction of @xmath0ca .",
    "this problem would be cured if the entropies in the ejecta were somewhat lower than those in our original model .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that ecsne can be , at least in part , the astrophysical source of @xmath0ca .",
    "the fact that ecsne can be also associated with the origin of many other isotopes ( of light trans - iron species and potentially of weak r - process species , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seems encouraging .",
    "our result also has implications for the interpretation of anomalies of @xmath0ca found in meteorites @xcite .",
    "so far , only hypothetical high - density sne  ia have been considered as the cause of these anomalies .",
    "ecsne could be , however , an additional source of the anomalies of @xmath0ca .",
    "ecsne may occur at about one - tenth of the rate of normal ccsne @xcite , that is , 12 events per millennium , which makes them much more common than the rare - class sne  ia ( once in 10,000 years , * ? ? ?",
    ". this would be important if the composition of the proto - solar system had been affected by a single or a few nearby sne .",
    "more work is needed before final conclusions about the role of ecsne as production sites of @xmath0ca can be drawn .",
    "in particular , further improvements of ecsn models ( e.g. , 3d , general relativity , resolution ) will be important to elucidate whether appreciable amounts of n - rich ejecta of ecsne satisfy the @xmath19-poor qse condition needed for the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0ca .",
