    "the electron - phonon interaction has proven to be an useful concept in many systems for describing coupled motions of electron and nuclei .",
    "this model for the interaction explains classic physical phenomena , such as conventional superconductivity  @xcite , and plays an important role in many active fields such as charge transport in molecular junctions  @xcite .",
    "this field contains a wealth of interesting physics , negative differential resistance  @xcite , hysteresis  @xcite , image charge dynamics  @xcite , negative friction  @xcite and multistability  @xcite to name a few , but is at the same time a challenge for a theorist .",
    "the quantum transport problem calls for a method which can cope with time - dependence in inhomogeneous open systems , and with interactions between charge carriers and other constituents . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have developed non - equilibrium many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) based on the kadanoff - baym equations  @xcite to study time - dependent quantum transport in systems with electron - electron interactions .",
    "the long term goal is to study time - dependent transport phenomena in a single formalism in the presence of both electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions . as a first step towards this goal",
    ", we have included the electron - phonon interactions in this formalism for finite systems in equilibrium and non - equilibrium  @xcite . as a benefit of addressing finite systems ,",
    "we are given the possiblity to test the performance of many - body approximations by comparing to exact diagonalization  @xcite results which are not available for open systems .",
    "in the present work , we focus on the electron - phonon interaction only to make this comparison as transparent as possible , and to simplify the analysis of the used many - body approximations .",
    "this also means that we can test the many - body approximations in a situation where there are qualitatively different ground states depending on the strength of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "such a situation is relevant in the case of quantum transport as the initial state affects the physics of quantum transport and is related to phenomena such as bistability  @xcite .",
    "the finite system studied here is the homogeneous , two - site holstein model which is a minimalistic model representing interacting electrons and phonons  @xcite .",
    "the electrons are allowed to occupy localized molecular orbitals and couple via their density to a primary molecular vibrational mode .",
    "this electron - phonon interaction gives rise to a situation in which the electron and nuclear motions are intertwined creating a bound state known as a polaron  @xcite .",
    "the holstein model has been widely used to study extended systems such as molecular crystals  @xcite .",
    "also the ground - state properties of the two - site system have been studied extensively with analytic and numerically exact methods  @xcite , in various forms of order - by - order perturbation theory  @xcite , and in terms of a cumulant treatment  @xcite .",
    "the present work extends these studies to diagrammatic self - consistent many - body perturbation theory which we have previously applied to purely electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "although self - consistent many - body theory has been used ubiquitously to investigate the ground state and spectral properties of the extended model  @xcite , to our knowledge small finite systems have not been investigated to the same extent .",
    "this observation together with the facts that finite systems form the interacting region of a typical quantum transport calculation  @xcite , and that the quality of a many - body approximation can change considerably with the system size  @xcite , makes the investigation of these approximations relevant also in the case of finite systems .",
    "the focus of the present work is in the situation in which the electron - phonon coupling leads to an effective attractive interaction between electrons , and for a sufficiently strong interaction to a two - electron bound state known as a bipolaron  @xcite .",
    "the competition between de - localization and localization brought upon by the kinetic energy and interaction is seen as qualitatively different ground states in the weak- and strong - interaction limits .",
    "this work addresses the question how many - body perturbation theory describes this change and the strong localizing effect of the interaction when homogeneity is not enforced a priori .",
    "the self - consistent diagrammatic many - body perturbation theory  @xcite is used in the present work to obtain the dressed electron and phonon propagators which can be used to calculate one - body observables and interaction energies .",
    "these objects are obtained from coupled dyson equations self - consistently , meaning that the self - energy is a functional of these propagators .",
    "this implies that perturbation theory is done to infinite order in the interaction albeit that only certain classes of perturbative terms are summed to infinite order .",
    "the self - energies are space - time non - local potentials describing interactions between electrons and phonons , and are subject to approximations .",
    "we are , in particular , interested in the so - called conserving approximations  @xcite , which are vital in quantum transport as they guarantee the conservation of energy , momentum and particle number .",
    "the self - energy approximations considered are the hartree and partially or fully self - consistent born approximations  @xcite which all are conserving in the sense that they conserve the particle number .",
    "the partially self - consistent born approximation is a standard approximation in the quantum transport case , while its fully self - consistent counterpart is not used as commonly  @xcite , but has been studied in the high - dimensional extended holstein model e.g.  in combination with dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite .",
    "one aim of this work is to bridge the gap between these two approximations by investigating the effects of increased self - consistency realized by dressing the phonon propagator .",
    "another important open question is the behavior of these approximations when we do not explicitly restrict ourselves to a homogeneous solution , but allow spontaneous symmetry - breaking , lack of which has been attributed to the breakdown of a fully self - consistent born approximation in the extreme adiabatic limit  @xcite . as we will show , the different physical regimes of the system show up as multiple solutions to the self - consistent equations of many - body perturbation theory , and some of these solutions do break the reflection symmetry of the two - site model .",
    "this is an example of the existence of multiple solutions in many - body perturbation theory , a topic which has been addressed recently in a more general context  @xcite , but here these solutions have a physical origin being related to a bipolaron formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce many - body perturbation theory and the framework in which it is used .",
    "this includes introducing the self - energy approximations , and explaining how observables are calculated .",
    "then the two - site holstein model is introduced , followed by the main section on analytic and numerical results in which we analyze in detail the exact bipolaronic ground state , and multiple solutions and symmetry breaking in the approximations .",
    "the results are presented starting with an exact diagonalization study , followed by results for different levels of perturbation theory , and ending with a comparison to exact results .",
    "lastly , we conclude with an outlook and summary of the results . supplementary material is presented in the appendices .",
    "the present work is based on many - body perturbation theory . in this section",

    "the ground state for two electrons ( @xmath109 ) is in the subspace with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the relative hamiltonian is also invariant under the operation of the parity operator , which swaps indices @xmath112 and @xmath113 and changes @xmath93 to @xmath114 .",
    "hence the eigenstates of @xmath104 have either even or odd parity . in particular , the ground state is even under parity operation . thus by symmetry , we have @xmath115=0 , @xmath116 , which are expectation values taken with respect to the symmetric ground state .",
    "the two - electron singlet hilbert space is then spanned by @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the electronic vacuum .",
    "the relative hamiltonian can be written in this subspace as the operator - valued matrix @xmath119 this hamiltonian can be diagonalized numerically by expressing the phonon operators as matrices in a basis set of fock number states @xmath120 , which in practical calculations is truncated up to a maximum value @xmath121 , i.e. @xmath122 . in our exact diagonalization approach",
    "@xmath123 turns out to be sufficient for the convergence of the relevant quantities .",
    "alternatively , using the fact that @xmath124 and by choosing a finite difference representation for momentum @xmath125 and the displacement @xmath93 operators , the diagonalization can also be performed in real space .",
    "either of the two diagonalization approaches yield accurate ground - state energies as long as the truncated basis for nuclear motion is large enough .",
    "however , each approach has its own advantages in calculating certain properties .",
    "we are now set to investigate the finite @xmath66 properties of this model and illustrate the bipolaronic nature of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig.probability ] , we show results for two sets of parameters , corresponding to the small and large electron hopping regimes : @xmath126 in anti - adiabatic regime on the left hand side and @xmath127 in adiabatic regime on the right hand side . the top panels show the two - electron ground - state energies @xmath128 , that is the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath129 , as a function of the effective electron - phonon interaction @xmath76 for both adiabatic ratios @xmath75 .",
    "these ground - state energies are compared with two times the one - electron ground - state energies @xmath130 , which are obtained by diagonalizing the relative hamiltonian represented in the one - electron subspace with @xmath131 ( same as @xmath132 ) .",
    "the figure shows that when the electron phonon interaction strength is small , the energies are very close to one another , and when the electron - phonon interaction strength is increased , the two - electron ground - state becomes much lower in energy and decreases faster as a function of the interaction .",
    "this suggests a physical picture in which for weak interactions the two electrons , or polarons , are almost independent . a strong electron - phonon interaction , on the other hand , gives rise to a large effective attraction between electrons leading to a strongly bound electron , or polaron pair , which is seen as increased binding energy @xmath133 .",
    "this picture can be elucidated by investigating the double occupancy which is a correlation function of the occupations of spin up and down electron at the same site . without loss of generality , we focus on site 1 for the double occupancy @xmath134 where @xmath135 , and @xmath136 is the two - electron ground state . the double - occupancy is shown in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.probability ] as a function of the electron phonon interaction strength @xmath76 for both adiabatic ratios @xmath75 .",
    "the figure shows that this quantity is equal to one - quarter for a non - interacting system stating due to symmetry that it is equally probable to find electrons in the same of different sites . as the interaction",
    "is increased , the double - occupancy approaches one - half irrespectively of the adiabatic ratio .",
    "this result implies that an electron - pair is formed as a function of the interaction .",
    "the effect of the adiabatic ratio is that the crossover from the non - interacting system to a system in which an electron pair is formed happens more abruptly in the adiabatic @xmath127 case .",
    "the increase of the binding energy indicates a crossover to a strongly bound two - electron state when the interaction is strong enough .",
    "this goes hand in hand with an increase of the double - occupancy which says that the probability of finding two electrons at the same site is large compared to the probability of finding them at different sites .",
    "this picture can be made more quantitative by introducing the joint probability of finding electrons at the sites @xmath137 and nuclei at the relative coordinate @xmath138 .",
    "the joint probability is defined as @xmath139 where @xmath140 with @xmath141 being an eigenstate of @xmath93 .",
    "the lower panels a ) , b ) and c ) of fig .  [ fig.probability ] display these probabilities .",
    "the probability of finding electrons on the same site is in the non - interacting limit equal to the probability of finding them at different sites . as the electron - phonon interaction",
    "is increased , the maximum of the joint probability of finding electrons on the site one ( two ) increases and the position of the maximum moves towards larger ( smaller ) values of the relative displacement . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum of the joint probability of finding electrons on neighboring sites decreases and the position of this maximum remains fixed at the origin as the interaction is increased .",
    "thus for any non - zero interaction it is more likely to find the electrons occupying the same site and accompanied by a non - zero displacement .",
    "this however does not mean that the ground state is characterized well by the notion of an electron pair and an associated displacement .",
    "this leads us to the concept of a working definition of a bipolaron .",
    "we regard for the present work a bipolaron being a good representative of the ground state when the maxima of the joint probabilities of electrons appearing at the same site , @xmath142 , cf .",
    "eq .  , is at least two times larger than the joint probability to finding the electrons at different sites @xmath143 .",
    "we note that this definition is not unique , and depending on ones viewpoint other choices can be made , but it does denote a situation in which an electron pair accompanied by a displacement is a dominant feature of the ground state .",
    "this working definition allows us to summarize the results of fig .",
    "[ fig.probability ] by saying that panels a ) and c ) represent in both adiabatic and anti - adiabatic regimes two nearly - free electrons and a bipolaron , respectively .",
    "the middle panel b ) , on the other hand , corresponds to a ground state which is not characterized well by a single notion of either two nearly - free electrons , two polarons , or a bipolaron .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.probability ] also display the probability @xmath144 of finding the nuclei at relative coordinate @xmath138 .",
    "the figure shows that prior to the bipolaron formation , this probability distribution has a single maximum located at the origin . as the interaction",
    "is increased , the ground state becomes more and more bipolaron - like and the nuclear distribution @xmath145 starts to split symmetrically , as it should due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian . in the adiabatic case",
    ", it already forms two well - separated peaks when @xmath146 in panel c ) , indicating that it is more likely to find the nuclei at @xmath138 far from zero , either positive or negative . in the anti - adiabatic case",
    ", this splitting happens much slower as a function of @xmath76 and the peaks are still not well - separated at @xmath147 .",
    "however , we already see the trend of the splitting behavior which is the same as in the adiabatic case , the only difference is that a quantitatively much larger @xmath76 is needed to split the nuclear distribution .",
    "hence , the formation of the bipolaron coincides with the splitting of the nuclear distribution in the adiabatic limit , while in the anti - adiabatic case , the bipolaron formation does not necessarily imply the splitting @xmath145 , and there is a smaller nuclear displacement associated with the bipolaron compared to the displacement in the adiabatic case .    as a last topic on exact properties ,",
    "we discuss the adiabatic limit which leads us naturally to the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation .",
    "this perspective leads us to scrutinize the splitting of the nuclear probability @xmath145 using the adiabatic potential energy surfaces .",
    "we use eq .  , and set @xmath148 in the bo approximation",
    ". then we diagonalize the 3 by 3 block in eq .  , where @xmath138 is now taking the role of a parameter .",

    "the shape of this potential determines therefore to a large extent the shape of @xmath145 . from the figure",
    ", we clearly see that the formation of a double minimum in @xmath149 directly attributes to the splitting of @xmath145 . in particular , in the adiabatic regime @xmath127",
    ", this correspondence is a very good approximation because the kinetic energy of the electrons is much larger than the phonon frequency , and hence the ground - state bo surface is enough to capture the motion of the nuclei . in eq .",
    ", we notice that the second term in the parenthesis , which is just the energy difference between the ground and the first excited bo surfaces ( eq .  ) , is small when @xmath75 is large ( anti - adiabatic ) . hence in the anti - adiabatic regime , the coupling between the lowest two surfaces is large , especially near the origin @xmath155 .",
    "this is why in fig .",
    "[ fig.probability ] b ) on the left , the correspondence between the potential surface and the shape of the probability distribution is not convincible .",

    "the figure shows that the difference approaches two as a function of the interaction also for the asymmetric solutions of the correlated approximations .",
    "this means that the agreement with the exact electron energy follows through the symmetry - broken eigenvectors of the density matrix .",
    "however , this is not the case for the symmetric solutions out of which the fully self - consistent agrees qualitatively with the exact natural occupation numbers .",
    "there is also an observation to be made from this figure , namely due to the fact that the particle number is always two , the eigenvalues are between zero and two for all approximate solutions .",
    "this shows that the many - body approximation here satisfy an @xmath96-representability condition  @xcite . in the anti - adiabatic limit",
    ", the natural occupation numbers can be used to construct the ground - state wave function , and therefore they give invaluable information about the bipolaronic ground state . the first step to make this correspondence is to map the holstein model to the attractive hubbard model using the lang - firsov transformation  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given for two electrons by @xmath290 where the transformed operators are @xmath291 and the density operator @xmath292 is defined as usual .",
    "if we take the anti - adiabatic limit , or more precisely @xmath293 such that @xmath76 remains finite  @xcite , we arrive at the hamiltonian @xmath294 where the phonon part is just the non - interacting one , and the electronic part is equal to the hamiltonian operator of the attractive hubbard model with the interaction @xmath295 .",
    "the ground - state wave function is a product of a zero - phonon state and an electronic wave function which can be written by lwdin - shull expansion  @xcite as @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the empty electronic state , and @xmath298 are called natural amplitudes . in general the coefficients",
    "@xmath299 are defined up to a sign  @xcite . however , since in this case the ground state can be calculated analytically we can readily determine the signs to be positive in our case . at the limit of strong interactions , the natural occupation numbers approach one which implies that @xmath300 approaches zero and therefore the ground - state wave function describes two electrons on the same site , which is the bipolaronic ground state in the anti - adiabatic case .",
    "the natural occupation numbers shown for the approximations in the anti - adiabatic case @xmath126 then imply that the fully self - consistent approximation describes a paired two - electron state without symmetry - breaking and localization .",
    "the figure also shows that this pairing is overestimated for a wide range of values of the interaction in the intermediate to strong couplings .",
    "the presented results re - enforce the picture that the asymmetric solutions can be seen to describe a classical - like , localized bipolaron .",
    "this kind of state is the degenerate ground - state solution in the extreme adiabatic and anti - adiabatic limits obtained by neglecting the nuclear and electron kinetic energies , but not for finite parameters for which degeneracy is broken and the solution is symmetric . on the other hand , we have seen that if we restrict ourselves to a solution which respects this symmetry , only the fully self - consistent approximation shows sufficient indirect evidence that a correlated two - electron state is formed as a function of the interaction .",
    "this indirect evidence is further supported by the natural occupation number analysis in the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "we have studied the ground - state properties of the homogeneous two - site and two - electron holstein model .",
    "our study has been conducted using many - body perturbation theory , based on the hartree , and partially and fully self - consistent born approximations .",
    "we have calculated electron densities , natural occupation numbers , as well as total energies and electron , phonon and electron - phonon interaction energies .",
    "we have analyzed the results by analytic and numerical means , and compared them to numerically exact results obtained via exact diagonalization .",
    "the results show that there exists a critical interaction above which the many - body approximations support at least three solutions .",
    "one of these solutions is spatially homogeneous while the other two are inhomogeneous in both electron population and nuclear displacement , and therefore break the reflection symmetry of the system .",
    "the symmetry - broken electron density approaches two on one of the sites and zero on the other , while the displacement increases and decreases linearly with the electron density , respectively .",
    "the energy components and total energies of these solutions have been shown to agree at best quantitatively with exact results , while their quantum contributions approach zero for strong interactions .",
    "these observations support the physical picture that the inhomogeneous solutions represent a localized , classical - like bipolaron .",
    "the asymmetric solutions are alike irrespective of the approximation , but this is not to the case for the homogeneous solutions .",
    "the comparison of the energy components and total energies shows that the homogeneous solutions of the hartree and partially self - consistent born approximations do not agree even qualitatively with exact results for intermediate to strong interactions .",
    "the fully self - consistent approximation instead does compare well with exact results at least up to intermediate interactions in the adiabatic case , and at least for weak interactions in the anti - adiabatic case .",
    "this approximation also shows a significant , although underestimated , change in the slope of the total energy in the adiabatic case @xmath127 in a qualitative agreement with the exact solution where we associate this change with a crossover to a bipolaronic state as in  @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous solution of the fully self - consistent born approximation is then understood to describe partially a bipolaron crossover in this adiabatic case .",
    "a study in an infinite dimensional extended system has shown that this approximation predicts qualitatively a polaronic crossover , but gives only exponentially decaying quasi - particle spectral weight and hence no true bipolaronic metal - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "the spin - summed natural occupation numbers obey a trend analogous to the energetics , they approach each other as a function of the interaction in the exact and fully self - consistent born solutions but do not change as significantly in the less sophisticated approximations .",
    "we have shown by mapping the model to the attractive hubbard model in the anti - adiabatic limit that natural occupation numbers which approach one another indicate the formation of a paired two - electron state .",
    "this observation favors a conclusion that the homogeneous solution of the fully self - consistent born approximation describes a paired two - electron state for the anti - adiabatic case @xmath126 considered here .",
    "the presented results contribute to understanding how these approximations behave in the presence of a strong localizing interaction .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the many - body approximations used in this work have multiple physical solutions , and they give rise to spontaneous symmetry - breaking if allowed .",
    "these general features appear naturally in the bipolaronic system studied here , and therefore raise a question if these features manifest themselves in dynamical settings , such as in time - dependent quantum transport through molecular junctions , as instable or metastable dynamics .",
