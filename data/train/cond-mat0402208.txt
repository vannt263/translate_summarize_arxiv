    "quantized vortex lines constitute one of the most characteristic features of superfluidity .",
    "they were originally predicted to occur in superfluid he ii  @xcite and have since been the subject of many studies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , quantized vortices have been predicted and observed in the bose - einstein condensates of dilute trapped cold gases  @xcite .",
    "apart from the quantized circulation @xmath6 , their properties closely resemble those of classical vortex lines , which have long been known to support circularly polarized oscillatory normal modes  @xcite .",

    "the general dispersion relation involves the bessel functions @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite , and the preceding approximate formula applies only for @xmath12 . in this kelvin mode",
    ", each element of the vortex core executes a circular orbit with a sense opposite to the circulating velocity around the vortex line . in the quantum - mechanical version , these modes therefore have quantized angular momentum with @xmath13 ( in units of @xmath14 ) relative to the angular momentum of the vortex itself  @xcite .    in the last year , bretin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have reported direct evidence for such kelvin modes in an elongated cigar - shaped @xmath15rb condensate . by driving the condensate with a near - resonant quadrupole excitation ( @xmath16 ) , they observed preferential decay of the mode with @xmath17 relative to that for @xmath18 .",
    "the authors ascribed this difference to the creation of two kelvin - wave excitations , each with @xmath19 and with opposite momenta @xmath20 determined by conservation of energy .",
    "theoretical analysis confirms this process and the corresponding decay line shape  @xcite .",
    "in addition , transverse images of the expanded condensate show the periodic structure associated with the kelvin - mode deformation  @xcite .",
    "essentially all theoretical analyses of kelvin waves in a superfluid have assumed that the fluid is uniform along the vortex axis ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) leading to the long - wavelength expression @xmath21 where the absolute value allows for the possibility of waves propagating in both directions .",
    "this unusual dispersion relation differs significantly from the nondispersive result @xmath22 for waves on a string .",
    "it arises because the dynamics here involves the velocity instead of the more familiar acceleration ; in effect , a vortex is massless , and its motion obeys first - order dynamical equations  @xcite .    in the case of a large dilute",

    "one aim of the present work is to demonstrate that there are other more significant alterations .",
    "a very general approach would be to rely on the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite that determines the time evolution of the condensate wave function @xmath30 .",
    "such a direct solution for a vortex wave in a nonuniform condensate would involve considerable numerical analysis .",
    "another possibility is to generalize pitaevskii s linearized theory of small - amplitude oscillations of a quantized vortex line  @xcite to the case of an inhomogeneous condensate .",
    "this calculation rapidly becomes intricate , for it involves several very different length scales : @xmath3 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; in contrast , pitaevskii studied an unbounded condensate and required only the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath34 .",
    "a more promising procedure is to rely on the quantum analog of the biot - savart law that determines the local velocity of each element of the vortex  @xcite .",
    "this formula is readily specialized to the case of a nearly straight vortex line in a large tf condensate .",
    "the system can execute circularly polarized helical waves , and the associated normal - mode eigenfunctions constitute a sturm - liouville set subject to natural boundary conditions at the two ends .",
    "for most of the length , the spatial nonuniformity can be incorporated with a phase - integral ( wkb ) approximation , but a thin boundary layer forms near the ends .",
