    "studies of the handful of young o - rich galactic remnants believed to be the results of massive stars allow one to probe kinematic asymmetries in the expanding ejecta at spatial scales not possible from extragalactic sn observations .",
    "they can also offer clues about the explosive mixing of chemically distinct zones in the progenitor star and the nature of the central compact remnant .    the young galactic remnant cassiopeia a ( cas  a ) provides perhaps the clearest look at the explosion dynamics of a high mass sn . with an explosion date",

    "they concluded that the bulk of the symmetries and asymmetries seen in cas a are properties intrinsic to the supernova explosion .",
    "one often cited piece of observational evidence that the cas  a progenitor underwent a highly aspherical explosion has been the presence of a ` flare ' or ` jet ' of unusually high - velocity sn debris extending some @xmath12 out along the northeast ( ne ) limb from the remnant center ( about twice that of main shell ejecta ) at a position angle of @xmath13 and visible even in the earliest photographic images of the remnant @xcite .",

    "while an x - ray analysis of cas  a s ne and sw jets concluded that they are unlikely to have played an important role in the explosion mechanism @xcite , the kinematic properties of the ne and sw jets have not been well determined and the limited data currently available for these regions can not constrain whether or not the two streams even comprise a genuine bipolar , jet - counterjet expansion structure .",

    "a lack of detectable deceleration in the proper motion of these knots over the last 50  yr and velocity changes of less than 5% over 300 yr @xcite allows one to assume ballistic trajectories from the coe described by the relation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the radial velocity , @xmath44 is the angular distance from the explosion center , and @xmath45 is the scaling factor .",

    "the large - scale distribution of cas  a s main shell of ejecta is shown in figure  [ fig : rings ] where knots having an expansion velocity outside a @xmath55  sphere have been excluded .",
    "consistent with the recent 3d models presented in @xcite based on infrared data , we find the main shell to be dominated by morphological structures in the form of partial or complete rings .",
    "the main difference of our 3d reconstructions shown here to those of @xcite is increased spatial resolution ( by a factor of @xmath56 ) and more precise radial velocity data ( by a factor of @xmath57 ) .",
    "we find at least six well - defined ring - like structures on the remnant s main shell with diameters between approximately @xmath3 ( 0.5 pc ) and @xmath4 ( 2 pc ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mercator ] , a mercator projection of the main shell knots is shown to illustrate the relative scale and distribution of the rings .",
    "these rings dominate the large - scale structure of the main shell and are present on the front , rear , and both east and west side hemispheres .",
    "the largest ejecta ring is located along the northern limb and is nearly entirely redshifted ( figure [ fig : rings ] , top right ) .",
    "connected to it by a small bridge of ejecta knots is a much smaller but thicker ring in the north that is entirely blueshifted ( figure [ fig : rings ] , top left ) .",
    "these two rings contain nearly all of the optical and infrared emission along the remnant s northern limb .",
    "a separate but also very large , outwardly extending broken ring is located near the base of the ne jet ( figure  [ fig : rings ] , bottom left ) .",
    "another ring of comparable size and radial extension lies immediately below it .",
    "+      five of the six most obvious ejecta rings are actually short cylinders giving them a crown - like appearance .",
    "the bases of these crowns are sometimes gently curved upward as seen in the smaller northern blueshifted ring ( figure  [ fig : rings ] , top left ) , and the large northern ring ( figure  [ fig : rings ] , top left and bottom left ) .",
    "the height in velocity space of these crowns that extend radially away from the coe is up to @xmath17 .",
    "the radial extent of the broken ring located near the base of the ne jet is largest ( figure  [ fig : rings ] , top right ) .    besides large - scale ejecta rings and crowned cylinders , the data show areas with a frothy ejecta substructure down to sizes of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "these small - scale features are often observed at the boundaries of larger rings in tightly arranged groupings .",
    "they can be distinguished in the mercator projection in figure  [ fig : mercator ] as the smallest rings and ellipses .",
    "similar small - scale ring - like structures can be seen in _ hst _ images ( fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the remnant s optically bright main shell ejecta lies fairly close to the plane of the sky and can be contained within a torus or thick disk structure ( see figure  [ fig : rings ] , bottom left ) . with respect to a unit vector normal to the plane of the sky directed from the remnant to the observer , the vector normal to the torus",
    "equatorial plane is tilted approximately @xmath60 to the west and @xmath60 to the north , in agreement to the findings of @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that conspicuous deviations from a simple disk structure are observed .",
    "for example , the compact , entirely blueshifted northern ring extends beyond the torus defined by the bulk of the main shell .",
    "we discuss this and other deviations from a thick disk structure more in section  [ sec : explosion ] .",
    "vector plots of outer high velocity ejecta are shown in figure  [ fig : jets ] where ejecta knots are represented by green ( east ) and blue ( west ) vectors from the remnant s coe .",
    "an animation has been made that shows these data rotated completely about the north - south axis ( movie 2 ) .",
    "considerably more knots are detected in the ne than in the sw .",
    "this imbalance is may be attributable in part to higher levels of extinction in the sw compared to the ne .",
    "fortunately , detections in the sw jet features are numerous enough to draw some conclusions about the relative properties of both high - velocity ejecta features .",
    "previous studies of the remnant s jets lacked the kinematic resolution and depth required to ascertain whether they form a true bipolar structure .",
    "our data indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "the ne and sw jet regions show a broad scattering of outlying , high - velocity knots that appear to be directed in nearly opposite directions and is suggestive of opposing flows of sn debris .",
    "although the ne material exhibits a slightly larger range of radial velocities compared to the sw , we find no clear kinematic distinction between the two distributions in terms of opening half - angle and maximum expansion velocity .",
    "+      the top left panel of figure  [ fig : jets ] shows the normal observer perspective of north up and east to the left . the distribution seen is much like the ` bowtie ' plot of @xcite ( their fig .",
    "4 ) created from measured proper motions of 1825 knots seen on _ hst _ images taken over a 9 month period .",
    "a straight line can be drawn that runs through the approximate center of both distributions , and this is maintained as the perspective is changed in the various panels of figure  [ fig : jets ] .",
    "these data reveal the brighter and richer ne jet s kinematic structure in much greater detail than previous studies .",
    "we find that instead of being a few thin streams of ejecta , the ne region actually encompasses a broad range of knot radial velocities including large redshifted velocities up to @xmath61 .",
    "prior spectroscopic data of the ne jet detected only a a handful of knots at these velocities @xcite .",
    "consequently , although the fastest knots lie close to the plane of the sky and thus exhibit relatively modest radial velocities , the ne jet s true structure is actually a rather broad fan of ejecta knots with an opening half - angle between @xmath62 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : jets_n_shell ] , four perspectives of the outer ejecta vectors with respect to the coe are shown along with the main shell reconstruction .",
    "the top two panels are in the same orientation as the top two panels of figure  [ fig : jets ] , and use the same color scheme to distinguish the east and west material .",
    "the possible connection between the main shell geometry and distribution of outer ejecta is discussed in section  [ sec : jets ] . also shown in figure",
    "[ fig : jets_n_shell ] , is the inferred motion of the x - ray point source ( xps ) believed to be a neutron star with a carbon atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the direction the xps determined originally in @xcite is towards an obvious hole in the distribution of outer ejecta and is briefly discussed in section  [ sec : xps ] .",
    "although optically - emitting debris may constitute only a small fraction of the total ejected mass in the cas a remnant , our observations offer superior spatial and kinematic resolution compared to previous surveys obtained via _",
    "chandra _ x - ray and _ spitzer _ infrared observations .",
    "moreover , cas  a s fastest moving material is best probed through optical studies .",
    "for example , optical emission from the ne and sw jets can be traced some @xmath63 farther out than in x - rays or infrared , and only a handful of outer optical ejecta knots around the remainder of the remnant are detected in even the deepest x - ray images of cas  a ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is now abundantly clear from the results of our survey and previous studies that the distribution of cas  a s ejecta is far from being random .",
    "at least half a dozen large and coherent ejecta ring - like structures are observed and their size and arrangement may be informing us about important properties of the explosion dynamics and subsequent evolution of the expanding debris .",
    "however , interpretation of these structures is complicated in that one must disentangle the observed remnant properties that may originate in the explosion from later influences related to possible post - explosion radioactive heating , ejecta interaction with the surrounding csm and interstellar medium ( ism ) , and effects of the reverse shock on the ejecta .",
    "an important additional caveat is that cas  a continues to evolve and has changed considerably in its optical appearance over the last 50 years that it has been monitored @xcite . on - going propagation of the remnant s reverse shock continues to excite new ejecta , revealing more of its entire distribution .",
    "hence , any conclusions made in the present must acknowledge this evolution and recognize that we are probably not seeing the entire remnant but only those parts which have recently undergone shock heating .    with these limitations in mind ,",
    "below we attempt to describe and understand the nature of the observed properties of cas  a s main shell and outlying high - velocity ejecta .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to establish the existence of conspicuous rings of reverse shocked ejecta in cas  a. these rings , clearly visible in the recent infrared survey of @xcite , are large ( diameter @xmath64 1 pc @xmath64 radius of cas a ) and are most certainly structures that are related to the true structure of the remnant s debris field and independent of any strong influences of the remnant s csm / ism environment .",
    "the optical data presented here does not alter this overall picture , but provides an improved , more detailed examination of cas a s expansion properties .    in figure",
    "[ fig : iron ] , we show the optically - emitting main shell ejecta along with the location of x - ray emitting iron - rich material measured from _ chandra _",
    "data presented in @xcite .",
    "an animation showing these data sets rotated about the north - south and east - west axes has been provided ( movie 3 ) .",
    "each of the three largest concentrations of fe - rich ejecta ( i.e. , along the west , north , and southeast limbs ) lie within and bounded by ring structures , strongly suggesting a causal relationship .",
    "@xcite noted the coincidence of large ejecta rings with the three regions of fe  k x - ray emission and argued that these and other less prominent features are regions where the ejecta have emerged from the explosion as ` pistons ' of faster than average ejecta .",
    "in this view , the remnant s main shell rings represent the intersection points of these pistons with the reverse shock , similar to the bow - shock structures described by @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation first suggested by @xcite that we favor is that the observed ejecta rings represent cross - sections of large cavities in the expanding ejecta created in part by a post - explosion input of energy from plumes of radioactive @xmath5ni - rich ejecta . @xcite",
    "have described how this input of energy might account for the high - volume filling factor of fe in sn  1987a despite its small mass , and @xcite and @xcite have investigated hydrodynamic simulations based on this model .",
    "one possible consequence of this scenario is the compression of surrounding non - radioactive material by the rising and expanding bubbles of radioactive @xmath5ni - rich ejecta , ultimately giving way to a `` swiss cheese '' ejecta structure .",
    "it is important to note that the main shell ejecta structures are observed as rings because we are biased by the reverse shock that only excites an thin shell of material .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to suspect the observed ejecta rings to be cross sections of what are actually larger spherical geometries ; i.e. , bubbles .",
    "the turbulent motions that would initiate this ni bubble structure in casa are not unlike recent 3d simulations of the large - scale mixing that takes place in the shock - heated stellar layers ejected in the explosion of a 15.5 m@xmath10 blue supergiant star presented in @xcite .",
    "as shown in their figure  2 , the progenitor s metal - rich core is partially turned over with nickel - dominated fingers overtaking oxygen - rich bullets .",
    "although the evolution of these simulations is strongly dependent on the internal structure of the progenitor star @xcite , it is still tempting to draw an association between the ni - rich outflows seen in the @xcite models and the rings of cas a.    however , there are difficulties with invoking a ni bubble picture to explain how the x - ray emitting fe ejecta are framed by rings of optical ejecta .",
    "fe associated with the bubble effect should be characterized by diffuse morphologies and low ionization ages @xcite .",
    "the x - ray bright fe we currently see , however , is actually at an advanced ionization age relative to the other elements and thus inconsistent with a ni bubble origin .",
    "it is possible that fe associated with ni bubbles remains undetected .",
    "the undetected fe would likely be of small mass compared to what is currently observable since estimates of cas  a s chemical abundances are close to model predictions ( @xmath65 ; @xcite ) , and be of low density @xcite .",
    "presently , however , there is weak evidence of unshocked fe ejecta in infrared data @xcite .",
    "moreover , an exhaustive x - ray survey of casa by @xcite led them to conclude that almost all of the fe ejected by the supernova is now well outside the reverse shock and visible in x - rays , with very little left in the center of the remnant .",
    "indeed , any fe associated with the bubble effect may be too faint and underionized to be readily identifiable @xcite .",
    "thus , while considerable evidence exists that argues against associating the x - ray bright fe - rich material with ni bubbles , the large - scale and coherent ejecta rings observed in cas  a are obviously not random filamentary ejecta structures , and their sizes , near spherical shapes , and ubiquity throughout the remnant are intriguingly suggestive of a ni bubble origin .",
    "the strikingly tight spatial coincidence between some optical ejecta rings and the boundaries of fe - rich ejecta seen in x - rays , perhaps best seen in the remnant s large northern ring of ejecta , lends support to this picture .",
    "future efforts to locate additional material internal and/or external to casa s main shell may help clarify our understanding of the processes responsible for the ring - shaped morphology of the majority of cas a s optically emitting ejecta .",
    "finally , we note that there is some evidence that expansion of radioactive ni - rich ejecta may have also influenced the ejecta structure at smaller scales .",
    "a frothy ring - like substructure at scales of 10@xmath22 ( @xmath66 parsec ) in high - resolution _ hst _ images @xcite is observed around some of the large rings .",
    "these small features may be due to fragments of ni - rich material pushing out surrounding material ( e.g. , blueshifted ring in figure  [ fig : rings ] , top left panel ) .",
    "however , this substructure should not be confused with possible influence from rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmhotz instabilities that can develop in clumpy ejecta due to their interaction with the reverse shock front .",
    "these processes may be the dominant ones behind the pronounced crown - like structure of the rings ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the large - scale ring structures of the main shell , there are two other observed properties of the main shell ejecta that may be related to the explosion dynamics .",
    "the first is the @xmath1 to @xmath2  radial velocity asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry has long been recognized in even the earliest optical observations of the remnant made by @xcite , and later more fully appreciated by observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second is the torus - like geometry observed for the bulk of the remnant s optical and infrared bright ejecta , discussed at length by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "interpreting these properties is complicated given the problem of distinguishing whether the remnant s observed geometry is a faithful representation of the explosion dynamics or has been significantly influenced by an inhomogeneous local csm and ism .",
    "@xcite argued that environmental effects were significant in understanding the remnant s blue and redshift velocity asymmetry .",
    "they concluded that the density of the surrounding medium is greater on the blueshifted near side , which would inhibit forward expansion and result in an apparently redshifted coe . in support of this conclusion",
    ", they cite the observed asymmetrical distribution of radial velocities of the circumstellar qsf knots , a majority of which ( 76% ) are blueshifted .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite note that there are major structural differences between the front and back interior surfaces of cas  a. these differences in brightness and structure could be due to different masses , densities , and energies in the two different directions suggesting the observed velocity asymmetry might be intrinsic to the explosion itself .",
    "@xcite further argue that the torus - like distribution of bright main shell ejecta is a result of the explosion dynamics .",
    "they conclude that although interaction with the csm affects the detailed appearance of the remnant , the bulk of the symmetries and asymmetries in cas  a are intrinsic to the explosion . in their framework",
    ", the remnant is the result of a flattened explosion where the highest velocity ejecta were expelled in a thick torus tilted not far off the plane of sky in a number of large - scale pistons .    in possible support of their picture , @xcite noted that @xcite found that relatively small angles off the sky plane ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) seem to be the rule for the remnant s small , fastest - moving outlying ejecta knots .",
    "that is , although many hundreds of outlying ejecta knots can be seen around most of cas  a s periphery , none have been detected close to its center .",
    "our extensive survey also was unable to find any small , very high - velocity knots within the main shell and projected near the remnant s center .",
    "rather than supporting a torus - like ejecta arrangement , however , this could indicate that a near tangent viewing angle may be important for a knot s optical visibility .",
    "@xcite originally proposed that a near tangent viewing factor might hold for both the remnant s outer knots and its main shell . if true , this would mean some portion of the remnant s facing and rear sides may remain undetected , and thus the currently observed torus - like configuration of bright emission not reflective of the remnant s true 3d structure .",
    "the notion of a disk geometry for the cas a remnant that happens to lie fairly near to the plane of the sky is also inconsistent with recent infrared observations that detected some of the remnant s interior , unshocked ejecta .",
    "@xcite observed redshifted [ ] and [ ] line emissions from interior debris along a sight line close to remnant center exhibiting velocities approaching 5000 km s@xmath28 .",
    "these velocities are comparable to the @xmath68 to @xmath2 km s@xmath28 maximum radial velocities seen for main shell ejecta , as well as the inferred maximum transverse velocity of around 6300 km s@xmath28 derived from proper motions ( @xmath69 yr@xmath28 ) of main shell ejecta knots assuming a remnant distance of 3.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "further support of this viewpoint are some conspicuous departures from a thick - disk geometry in the distribution of main shell ejecta .",
    "rear - facing ejecta seem to cut off abruptly along an angled plane , while the front - facing ejecta do not .",
    "in particular , the northern , blueshifted ring forms a conspicuous bulge from the apparent torus ( see bottom left panel of figure [ fig : rings ] ) .",
    "there are aspects of the asymmetric distribution of the remnant s outermost ejecta that also indicate possible influence of an inhomogeneous environment . in figure",
    "[ fig : boundary ] , the distribution of material as observed from two sides of cas  a looking toward the base of the ne and sw jets is shown .",
    "the material in the sw jet region largely follows the abrupt boundary cutoff , as does the main shell ejecta .",
    "ejecta in the the ne jet region , however , do not follow this cut - off .",
    "deep h@xmath34 images of cas  a show evidence for much more h - rich csm / ism material in the eastern limb than in the western limb @xcite , which is consistent with the cut - off being due to environmental effects .",
    "the nature of the anomalously high velocities of ejecta in the ne and sw regions has long been a puzzle .",
    "@xcite suggested the ne jet might be the sole surviving part of an outer , high - velocity shell that has been subsequently decelerated in all other directions .",
    "alternatively , because the distribution of emitting gas may not necessarily be the same as the actual distribution of gas in cas  a , the jets may simply be the most visible part of a larger population of the remnant s outer , high velocity knots @xcite .    along similar lines ,",
    "asymmetric debris structures produced by circumstellar interaction has been theoretically modeled by @xcite who show how a jet - like feature of sn ejecta can be generated in the progenitor s equatorial plane from pole / equator density gradients in the local csm .",
    "thus , these high - velocity regions may be secondary features caused by instability - powered flows from an equatorial torus , where the explosion axis is loosely defined by the x - ray iron - rich regions found in the southeast and northwest @xcite .    however , the very prominent rupture - like features in the main shell near the base of the ne jet visible in x - ray , optical , ir , and radio images ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) are certainly suggestive of an explosive formation process .",
    "although perhaps not indicative of a jet - induced explosion , there is nonetheless substantial evidence that the ne and sw jets are somehow associated with core - collapse explosion dynamics in some way .",
    "for example , analyses of _ chandra _ x - ray spectra indicate that the ne jet could not be formed through interaction with a cavity or lower density region in the csm @xcite .",
    "the remnant s ejecta would have expanded rapidly into a csm cavity , and led to a density too low for electron - ion equilibration to match the observed values .",
    "@xcite estimate that a factor of two more explosion energy went into the ne jet direction compared to other regions .    the location of chemically distinct optically - emitting knots in both jets is also consistent with an unusual , high - velocity ejection of underlying mantle material .",
    "knots exhibiting a mix of h@xmath34 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] line emissions are _ only _ observed in the jet regions , suggesting an eruptive and turbulent mixing of the underlying s , o , and ar rich material with photospheric h- and n - rich layers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , optical knots in the ne and sw jets lying farthest out and possessing the highest ejection velocities show no detectable emission lines other than those of [ ] , suggesting an origin from the s - si - ca - ar rich layer deep inside the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : jets ] , we find that the overall conical distributions of the ne and sw jet regions exhibit comparable maximum expansion velocities and are broadly anti - parallel in an orientation consistent with a bipolar jet - counterjet structure",
    ". however , the observed opening half - angles of these two flows ( @xmath70 ) is quite broad and is not what would be anticipated in a highly - collimated ( opening half - angle @xmath71 ) jet - induced explosion .",
    "thus , the broadness and estimated low energies of the ne and sw jets make it unlikely that they are signatures of a jet - induced explosion scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there appears to be only a tenuous connection between the ne and sw jet regions and any of the main shell s ejecta rings .",
    "the centers of cones broadly defining the ne and sw ejecta streams as sampled in our survey only loosely point to centers of ejecta rings .",
    "the respective distributions are illustrated in figure  [ fig : jets_n_shell ] , where the outer knot vectors are plotted with the main shell surface reconstruction .",
    "particularly suggestive is the ne jet region , where the bulk of high - velocity material appears to be emanating from a large main shell ring that has a pronounced radial extension . in this regard , the main shell rings and the jet - like streams of higher velocity debris could be dynamically related .",
    "however , for both the ne and sw jets , many knots have trajectories that do not pass through any main shell rings . in light of the large number of faint , outermost high - velocity jet knots , it is possible that additional material at even higher positive and negative radial velocities may lie undetected , broadening the jets even more .",
    "future work mapping the chemical abundances of jet knots to their kinematics might contribute to a better understanding of their nature and possible relationship to the main ejecta shell .",
    "an additional clue to the nature of the explosion dynamics may come from understanding the properties of the inferred motion of the central xps .",
    "the location of the xps @xmath72 to the southeast of the estimated coe ( p.a.@xmath73 ) indicates a transverse velocity ` kick ' of @xmath74  imparted to the compact object during the explosion @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the projected line connecting the ne and sw jets lies nearly perpendicular to the inferred direction of the xps ( see figure  [ fig : jets ] ) . assuming the ne / sw axis to be the most significant in the original core - collapse , this runs counter to most jet - induced explosion models that predict that the neutron star will undergo a kick roughly aligned with the jet axis @xcite .",
    "there is a noticeable absence of outlying ejecta along the axis of the xps s inferred motion @xcite . with the possible exception of unlikely and extremely localized extinction conditions , deep imaging of cas  a surveying the entire remnant ensures that there is no observational bias that could explain the lack of detection of ejecta in these regions . although possibly just a coincidence , it is interesting that the xps should be moving with a trajectory in line with the only two significant gaps of the outer ejecta which are located nearly perpendicular to the ne - sw jet axis .",
    "we note that @xcite showed that strong [ ] emission is observed symmetrically around the xps , with an axis also close to the direction of the inferred kick .",
    "although @xcite determined that there is not enough mass / energy in the ne - crescents to affect the xps motion , they may perhaps arise due to the same dynamical asymmetries that led to the xps motion @xcite .",
    "recent 3d reconstructions of other young ccsn remnants have suggested that many of the kinematic properties observed in cas  a are not unique .",
    "although only a handful of known snrs are appropriate for this kind of analysis , those that have been studied have revealed evidence of the same large - scale ejecta rings , velocity asymmetries , and high - velocity bipolar asymmetries as observed in cas  a.    for example,@xcite mapped the [ ] @xmath355007 line emission dynamics of the young oxygen - rich supernova remnant 1e 0102.2 - 7219 in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "they confirmed earlier doppler measurements of @xcite that showed the presence of large ejecta rings like those observed in cas  a. also like in cas  a , they found 1e 0102.2 - 7219 to have an overall velocity asymmetry in its bulk material , such that redshifted material contained fainter clumps but with higher velocities than the blueshifted material .    a similar [ ] @xmath355007 survey of the young oxygen - rich supernova remnant n132d in the large magellanic cloud by @xcite also uncovered properties similar to cas  a. they found the majority of the ejecta to form a ring of @xmath6412 pc in diameter inclined at an angle of @xmath75 to the line of sight , and evidence of a polar jet associated with a very fast oxygen - rich knot .",
    "the survey led @xcite to speculate that the overall observed shape of the snr to have been strongly influenced by the pre - supernova mass loss from the progenitor star .",
    "work by @xcite on the core - collapse snr g292.0 + 1.8 shows that it too has properties like those seen in cas  a. proper motion measurements of g292.0 + 1.8 s fast filaments exhibit systematic motions outward from a point near the center of the radio / x - ray shell that lies @xmath76 northwest from the young pulsar psr j1124 - 5916 .",
    "the inferred motion of the pulsar has a transverse velocity of 440 , which is close to that observed in cas  a s xps .",
    "additionally , the fastest ejecta in g292.0 + 1.8 form a bipolar outflow along an axis oriented roughly north  south in the plane of the sky . the remnant appears to have undergone a complex evolution resulting from a possibly asymmetric sn explosion and interaction with non - uniform ambient ism ( see also @xcite ) , which is a scenario not too different from the one we envision for cas  a.      finally , we consider how the kinematic properties of cas  a discussed here may be linked to phenomena observed in the late - time optical emissions of extragalactic supernovae .",
    "@xcite summed all main shell spectra presented in section [ sec : observations ] into a single , integrated spectrum mimicking what the remnant would appear as as an unresolved extragalactic source .",
    "similarities were seen between this integrated cas  a spectrum and several late - time optical spectra of decades - old extragalactic sne .",
    "particularly well - matched with cas  a were sn  1979c , sn  1993j , sn  1980k , and the ultra - luminous supernova remnant in ngc  4449 .",
    "@xcite found that both cas  a and decades old extragalactic sne show pronounced blueshifted emission with conspicuous line substructure in [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] . since the emission line substructure observed in the forbidden oxygen emission line profiles of cas  a",
    "are associated with the large - scale rings of ejecta , we suggest that identical features in the intermediate - aged sne which have often been interpreted as ejecta ` clumps ' or ` blobs ' are , in fact , probable signs that large - scale rings of ejecta are common in sne .",
    "the link is strongest between cas  a and sn  1993j , given that these were both type iib explosions and that they exhibit extremely similar forbidden oxygen profiles despite the three centuries of evolution that separate them .",
    "we have presented 3d kinematic reconstructions of the optical emission from the supernova remnant cas  a based on radial velocity measurements extracted from long - slit and multi - slit spectra .",
    "this data set is of high spatial and kinematic resolution and encompasses the ne and sw streams of high velocity ejecta jets that until now have never been surveyed to this depth .",
    "the major results and conclusions of this study are as follows :    \\1 ) we confirm the findings of several previous kinematic studies of cas  a that show the bulk of the remnant s main shell ejecta to be arranged in several well - defined complete or broken ring - like structures .",
    "these ring structures have diameters that can be comparable to the radius of the remnant ( @xmath641 pc ) . some rings show considerable radial extensions giving them a crown - like appearance , while other rings exhibit a frothy , ring - like sub - structure on scales of @xmath64 @xmath66 pc",
    ".    such large - scale ejecta rings may be a common phenomenon of young , core - collapse supernova remnants .",
    "evidence for this comes in part from lumpy emission line profile substructure seen in both an integrated cas  a spectrum and several late - time optical spectra of extragalactic supernovae obtained years to decades after explosion . because this line substructure can be directly mapped to the large - scale rings of our cas  a reconstruction , we suggest a similar origin may apply to unresolved extragalactic remnants .",
    "\\2 ) the bulk of cas  a s optically bright ejecta populate a torus - like geometry that is tilted approximately 30@xmath0 with respect to the plane of the sky and exhibit a @xmath1 to @xmath2  radial velocity asymmetry . unlike the conclusion reached by @xcite ,",
    "we suggest that this observed geometry and velocity asymmetry is not representative of the true overall kinematic properties of the original explosion . instead",
    ", an observational bias caused by a near tangent viewing angle effect and interaction with an inhomogeneous csm / ism environment has likely contributed to some of cas  a s presently observed kinematic properties .",
    "\\3 ) the size , shape , and ubiquity of large - scale , reverse shock heated ejecta rings in cas  a are consistent with a bubble - like interior structure .",
    "it is possible that some of these structures were generated by the input of energy from radioactive @xmath5ni rich ejecta that produced low density bubbles surrounded by non - radioactive , intermediate mass element - rich ejecta .",
    "while the spatial coincidence between x - ray emitting fe - rich material and some of the remnant s large ejecta rings is suggestive of such a origin , the high ionization age of the x - ray bright fe suggests that this material is not directly associated with ni bubbles .",
    "\\4 ) our deep optical survey shows the remnant s ne and sw jet features , which contain cas  a s highest velocity ejecta , to be unexpectedly broad streams of ejecta knots with comparable conical opening half - angles of approximately @xmath77 .",
    "the jets appear to lie in an orientation consistent with an opposing and wide bipolar outflow .",
    "the broadness together with low energy estimates of the ne and sw jets argue against them being associated with a jet - induced explosion . however , several kinematic and chemical properties support the view that they were formed during core collapse and independent of effects from the local csm or ism .",
    "faint ejecta in both jets at even higher expansion velocities may lie as yet undetected .",
    "we end by noting that similar radial velocity data sets spanning x - ray , optical , and infrared wavelengths of other young sn remnants may provide additional insights and tests of various core - collapse sn models .",
    "a comparison of cas  a s properties with those of other young remnants , especially ones supplemented with chemical abundance analyses in addition to kinematics , may also help to further constrain details of the explosion mechanism , post - explosion dynamics , ejecta instabilities , and explosive nucleosynthesis . with the growing success obtaining multi - perspective optical spectra of light",
    "echoes associated with other historical galactic supernovae e.g. , sn1572 @xcite , and those nearby in the lmc and smc @xcite , the possibility of developing 3d reconstructions of other young ccsn supernova remnants with known sn subtypes may be possible in the future .",
