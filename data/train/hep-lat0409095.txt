    "there are a number of important issues in heavy quark phenomenology that can be addressed using the static quark formulation for the heavy quark .",
    "the mass of the bottom quark is a fundamental parameter of the standard model . as noted by gimenez",
    "et al  @xcite , the error on the mass of the bottom quark due to the use of static quarks for the @xmath2 quark is only of order 30 mev  @xcite .",
    "the heavy flavour experiments such as babar , belle , cdf , and d0 are extensively testing the ckm matrix formalism .",
    "there are a number of non - perturbative qcd matrix elements that must also be computed to test the ckm formalism .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the decay constants of the @xmath3 to @xmath4 mesons ( @xmath5 ) is a crucial qcd quantity for the unitarity checks of the ckm matrix .",
    "the basis of our calculation is unquenched gauge configurations generated with the non - perturbatively improved clover action and the wilson gauge action .",
    "the lattice parameters are : volume @xmath6 , @xmath7 = 5.2 , and the clover coefficient was the non - perturbative value of 2.0171 .",
    "the full details of the action and results on the hadron spectroscopy have been published  @xcite .",
    "ukqcd has already published  @xcite an extensive analysis of the spectrum of static - light mesons .",
    "the @xmath8 decay constant is extracted from the amplitudes in the two point correlator .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the interpolating operator for static - light mesons .",
    "we used all - to - all propagators and fuzzed sources to get accurate correlators  @xcite .",
    "we fit a 3 exponential model to a 5 by 5 smearing matrix .",
    "the @xmath8 decay constant is defined by the matrix element below : @xmath11 the axial current is improved using the alpha formulation  @xcite , including the correction term introduced by morningstar and shigemitsu  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the decay constant and the amplitude is .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the renormalisation factor . here",
    "we explore the sea quark dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "we have checked that the variation of @xmath13 with sea quark mass is small .",
    "full details of our calculation of the bottom quark mass have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 @xmath16 were used for the central value .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 , from the lattice calculation , contains an unphysical @xmath18 divergence ( @xmath19 ) that must be subtracted off to obtain the physical binding energy ( @xmath20 ) . @xmath21",
    "the pole quark mass is determined from @xmath22 the physical value  @xcite of the meson mass @xmath23 ( 5.369 gev ) is used .    in the static theory",
    "@xmath24 has been calculated to two loops by martinelli and sachrajda  @xcite .",
    "the pole mass is converted to @xmath25 using continuum perturbation theory  @xcite . @xmath26",
    "the lattice matching is only done to @xmath27 , hence we convert the pole mass to @xmath25 at the same order , using a consistent coupling , so the differences in the series are physical .",
    "this avoids problems with renormalons .",
    "our final result for @xmath28 ( in gev ) is @xmath29 where the errors are ( from left to right ) : statistical , perturbative , neglect of @xmath30 terms , ambiguities in the choice of lattice spacing , and error in the choice of the mass of the strange quark .",
    "our result is consistent with that from gimenez et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath31 from an unquenched qcd calculation .",
    "the error on the ratio of the @xmath5 has recently been increased , because the chiral log term has not been observed in lattice data  @xcite .",
    "for example , the jlqcd  @xcite collaboration quote @xmath32 , where the first error is statistical and the second error is from the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty in jlqcd s result is from the chiral extrapolation .",
    "all lattice calculations , apart from some preliminary evidence from one  @xcite , have only seen linear dependence of the heavy - light decay constant on the quark mass .    the one loop correction , in heavy - light chiral perturbation theory , to the static - light decay constant is  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 coupling and @xmath36 .",
    "the coupling @xmath34 has recently been measured at cleo .",
    "it has also been determined from quenched lattice qcd .    in figure  [ eq : heavylog ]",
    "@xmath14 using @xmath37 = 0.1350 , 0.1355 , and 0.1358 is plotted . at @xmath37",
    "= 0.1358 , 138 configurations were used .",
    "the other two @xmath38 values used ensemble sizes of 60 .",
    "jlqcd  @xcite reported that the heavy - light decay constant had only linear dependence on quark mass .",
    "the new data at @xmath37 = 0.1358 does show some deviation from linearity . although the figure  [ eq : heavylog ] is encouraging  the deviation",
    "is not statistically significant .",
    "the curve is the expression from chiral perturbation theory ( equation  [ eq : heavylight ] ) drawn for illustration , rather the result of a fit .    as has been noted by many authors  @xcite the chiral log structure of @xmath39 and @xmath8",
    "are rather similar .",
    "hence ukqcd s claim to see the effect of the chiral logs in @xmath39  @xcite suggests that there should be deviations from linear dependence of @xmath40 on the quark mass .",
    "the value of the lightest pion in our calculation is roughly 420 mev  @xcite .",
    "the different treatments of the heavy - light chiral perturbation theory of sanz - cillero et al .",
    "@xcite show that a deviation of linearity in quark mass for @xmath8 is expected at these pion masses .      in ukqcd s work on chiral logs in the pion decay",
    "constant , there was a concern about finite volume effects  @xcite . at @xmath37",
    "= 0.1358 it was argued from chiral perturbation theory that the finite volume effects were of the order of 8% in @xmath39 .",
    "a similar order of magnitude effect was also estimated by colangelo and haefeli  @xcite .",
    "the volume of the lightest data set is @xmath41 . recently",
    "arndt and lin  @xcite have studied the effect of the finite volume on the ratio of heavy light decay constants and bag parameters . for a pion mass",
    "around 400 mev on box size of @xmath42 , the finite volume effect in the ratio @xmath5 is 0.006 .",
    "this suggests that the finite size effects are small .",
    "however , the next to leading order estimate of finite size effects in @xmath39 was significant  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , colangelo and haefeli  @xcite claim that there is not enough information to do a similar estimate for @xmath8 .    as the aim of this work is to look for chiral logs in the @xmath8 decay constant that are a small effect",
    ", it is important to reduce the statistical errors .",
    "we are already using all - to - all techniques and fuzzing . the number of available gauge configurations is fixed .",
    "the alpha collaboration  @xcite have developed a new variant of the static formalism that reduces the @xmath43 mass renormalisation that is thought to be the reason for the poor signal to noise ratio in static - light calculations .",
    "we are currently running with this formalism and we expect to report results in the future .",
