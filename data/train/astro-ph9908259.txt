    "dusty tori around active galactic nuclei ( agns ) play an important role in the classification of seyfert galaxies .",
    "( antonucci & miller 1985 ; see also antonucci 1993 for a review ) .",
    "seyfert galaxies observed from a face - on view of the torus are recognized as type 1 seyferts ( s1s ) while those observed from a edge - on view are recognized as type 2 seyferts ( s2s ) . in this way , the dusty tori act as a material anisotropically obscuring the emission from their interior region .",
    "dusty tori themselves are also important emitting sources in agns .",
    "dust grains within the torus absorb high - energy photons from the central engine , and re - emit them in the mid - infrared ( mir ) regime .",
    "therefore , infrared radiation from the dusty torus emission is useful in studying the physical properties of the tori in agns ( e.g. , dopita et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "since the tori are quite optically thick , the mir spectrum is predicted to have strong dependence on the viewing angle [ efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1990 ; pier & krolik 1992 , 1993 ( hereafter pk92 and pk93 , respectively ) ; granato & danese 1994 ; granato , danese , & franceschini 1996 , 1997 ] . when the torus is observed from a face - on view",
    ", its hot inner surface is seen and the emission at @xmath7 10 is enhanced . when observed from a edge - on view , the emission at @xmath7 10 is obscured and thus weakened .",
    "heckman ( 1995 ) observed that the averaged ratio of @xmath8-band ( 10 ) flux to nonthermal radio flux is higher in s1s than in s2s ( see also giuricin , mardirossian , & mezzerre 1995 ) .",
    "heckman , chambers , & postman ( 1992 ) observed a similar enhancement in radio - loud quasars ( i.e. , type 1 ) with respect to radio galaxies ( i.e. , type 2 ) .",
    "pk93 observed that flux ratios of @xmath2 band ( 3.5 ) to @xmath8 band in s1s are higher than those in s2s .",
    "fadda et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed that the mir spectrum is steeper ( i.e. , redder ) in s2s than in s1s .",
    "however , further details of the mir emission from dusty tori are unknown .",
    "this paper proposes the flux ratio of @xmath2 band to _ iras _ 25 band as a new mir diagnostic for the dusty torus model (  2 ) .",
    "we compile the observational data from the literature (  3 ) , compare the above ratios of s1s with those of s2s (  4 ) , and discuss properties of the tori (  5 ) .",
    "as stated above , the torus emission is expected to be more anisotropic at @xmath9 @xmath10 10 than at @xmath9 @xmath11 20 because the visibility of the inner wall of the torus is highly viewing angle dependent .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to compare s1s with s2s in a flux ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath12 . since the _ iras _ photometric data are available for most of the nearby seyfert galaxies ( moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) , we adopt the flux ratio between @xmath2 band and _ iras _ 25 band , @xmath13.\\ ] ] the basic concept of our new mir diagnostic is schematically shown in figure 1 .",
    "since the viewing angle dependence is more significant at 3.5 , s2s are expected to have lower values of @xmath14 than s1s .    here",
    "we note that pk 93 used the flux ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath8 bands , @xmath15 , to compare s1s with s2s .",
    "however , the @xmath8-band flux is affected by a silicate line at 9.7 . when the torus is observed from a edge - on view",
    ", the silicate line is seen as an absorption line , and thus both the fluxes in @xmath2 and @xmath8 bands are weakened . the difference between s1s and s2s in @xmath15",
    "is thereby expected not to be as prominent as that in @xmath4 .",
    "to perform a statistical analysis with the mir diagnostic defined in the previous section , we have compiled photometric data in @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and _ iras _ 25 bands from the literature ( e.g. , ward et al .",
    "1987 ; roche et al . 1991 ; moshir et al .  1992 ; pk93 ) . since radiation form agns is anisotropic in most of the energy bands , it is difficult to construct a statistically complete sample .",
    "we instead adopt three samples chosen by different selection criteria .",
    "the first sample consists of the cfa seyfert galaxies ( huchra & burg 1992 ) , which provide a well defined collection of objects limited by the @xmath16 magnitude of their host galaxies .",
    "the second sample is the one limited by the hard x - ray flux from 2 to 10 kev ( ward et al .",
    "since hard x - rays arise from the central engine itself and are not affected seriously by dust grains , this sample is expected to be fair at least for s1s .",
    "the third sample is taken from roche et al .",
    "this sample is not complete but composed of @xmath8-band bright objects . for each object in this sample , roche et al .",
    "( 1991 ) observed an emission feature at 11.3 , which allows us to examine the presence or absence of any circumnuclear star formation activities .",
    "our cfa , ward , and roche samples contain 18 s1s and 6 s2s , 20 s1s and 4 s2s , and 11 s1s and 11 s2s , respectively .",
    "some objects are included in more than one sample . in total , there are 31 s1s and 14 s2s .",
    "their basic data are summarized in table 1 .",

    "the absence of the broad - line region in this galaxy could result from , e.g. , obscuration of the central region by a small cloud .",
    "there is no significant difference in the distributions of s1s and s2s among the three samples in figures 2@xmath71@xmath73 , thus our samples is probably free of large orientation bias .",
    "if we apply the kolmogrov - smirnov ( ks ) test , the probability that the observed distributions of s1s and s2s originate in the same underlying population turns out to be 0.275 % .",
    "when galaxies shown by white bars are included , the distribution of s2s is different among the three samples .",
    "this difference is likely to come from the different sampling criteria .",

    "the @xmath76 ( nucleus ) values are taken from kotilainen , ward , & williger ( 1993 ) and granato et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and are used as a measure of the luminosity of the central engine .",
    "if the observed @xmath4 ratio depends on the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine rather than the seyfert type , there would be a certain relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath76 ( nucleus ) .",
    "since no clear correlation is seen in figure 3 , we conclude that the difference in the intrinsic nuclear luminosity does not affect the observed value of @xmath4 in s1s .",
    "this conclusion is applicable to s2s because s1s and s2s are likely to have the same torus properties .",

    "the ks probability that the underlying populations of s1s and s2s are the same is 0.0404 % .",
    "although this value is smaller than that for the @xmath4 ratio , the separation between s1s and s2s in @xmath70 ( figure 4 ) is less clear than that in @xmath4 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath8-band emission is affected by the silicate feature at 9.7 .",
    "the @xmath4 values for the s1s are clearly separated from those for the s2s at the critical value of @xmath77 .",
    "this limits the extent to which the dusty torus can vary among seyfert galaxies ; such variations would add `` noise '' and cause overlap between the two types .",
    "hereafter , we compare our results with theoretical torus models of pk92 and pk93 , and investigate the model which agrees best with the observations .",

    "since models 2 and 3 do not give the critical viewing angle , these models are not appropriate for dusty tori in seyfert galaxies .",
    "to proceed further , we have to compare the results with other observational properties of seyfert galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "narrow - line regions of s2s often exhibit conical morphologies , which are due to shadowing of the nuclear ionizing continuum by the torus .",

    "the derived critical viewing angles ranges from 27 to 46 . since models 4 and 5",
    "give too large critical viewing angles ( @xmath97 ) , they are not appropriate for dusty tori in seyfert galaxies . consequently , among the six models of pk92 and pk93 , model 6 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the best torus model .",
    "the @xmath14 values of the s2s lie between @xmath55 and @xmath77 , which correspond to the viewing angles between @xmath100 and @xmath101 . on the other hand , @xmath14 values of the s1s",
    "lie between @xmath77 and @xmath102 .",
    "this range is not explained by model 6 .",
    "the locus of model 6 in figure 6 is drawn down only to @xmath103 . since the @xmath14 value at the smaller viewing angle",
    "is expected to be nearly constant , it would be impossible to reproduce the @xmath14 ratio as high as @xmath102 .",
    "one possibility that explains this higher ratio may be the 3 bump often seen in type 1 agns .",
    "this bump may be attributed to thermal emission from hot dust grains with @xmath104 k ( e.g. , pk93 ) . because the models of pk92 and pk93 assumed that the host dust component is an additional source to the torus , @xmath14 is underpredicted at small inclination angles .",
    "although it is controversial whether this host dust component is a separate component from the torus or the inner surface of the torus , those hot dust grains lie close to the central engine in either case .",
    "since their emission is important only when the central region is clearly visible , the 3 bump is negligible in s2s . therefore the critical @xmath4 and @xmath105 are not affected by the treatment of the 3 bump .",
    "we have examined only the small and sparse sets of the model parameters presented by pk92 and pk93 .",
    "further analyses with the larger and denser parameter sets are required to understand the torus properties in more detail .",
    "nevertheless , our most important result , which has been obtained firstly with the new mir diagnostic , is the clear separation in the @xmath4 ratio between s1s and s2s .",
    "this strongly suggests that the torus properties do not vary among seyfert galaxies .",
    "the effective temperature of the inner wall may be universal as a result of that the inner wall is formed by balancing the rate of dust destruction with the rate at which the torus clouds drift inward ( krolik & begelman 1988 ; pk92 ) .",
    "we suspect that there are also certain mechanisms confining the vertical structure of the torus and shaping the uniform semi - opening angle .",
