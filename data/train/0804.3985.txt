    "<S> stress effects are of great interest in modern ulsi technology since they can be employed to improve various material properties . </S>",
    "<S> uniaxial stress has been employed in mosfet devices since the 90 nm node technology step to improve carrier mobility  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> properly applied stress can also suppress dopant diffusion  @xcite , enhance activation  @xcite , and reduce the band gap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , understanding stress effects becomes essential for further mosfet scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> as deactivation is governed by as@xmath0v@xmath1 cluster formation , and clusters with @xmath2 and @xmath3 are considered as the dominant species in deactivation kinetics  @xcite . under equilibrium conditions , the concentrations of defect x ( as , v or as@xmath0v ) is determined by the free as and v concentrations and cluster formation energies : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the formation enthalpy , and a includes the configuration and formation entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the total chemical as concentration is given by @xmath6 table  [ as : ef ] lists the formation energies of as@xmath0v complexes based on the total free energy of 64-atom ( or 63-atom , with vacancy ) super - cells using the density functional theory ( dft ) code vasp  @xcite with pw91 gga potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations were done at a 250 ev energy cut - off with 2@xmath7 monkhorst - pack * k*-point sampling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each time an as atom is added to a vacancy , the formation energy is lowered by about @xmath8 ev , and thus a larger complex is more stable than a smaller one . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the as@xmath0v concentrations based on the formation energies listed in table  [ as : ef ] . </S>",
    "<S> since dft gga underestimates the vacancy formation energy by about 1 ev  @xcite , we also applied a correction for the as@xmath0v formation energies using experimental values  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as@xmath9v has the lowest formation energy and becomes the dominant cluster under equilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> smaller clusters can be formed during epitaxial as - doped si growth and early stages of annealing , and can dominate before full equilibration is reached  @xcite , but we restrict our analysis to equilibrium conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ as : cas ] shows the isolated as concentration as a function of the total as concentration . as the number of as forming as@xmath9v increases to become a significant fraction of free as , the free as concentration starts deviating from the total chemical as concentration , which is consistent with previous reports  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that the as@xmath9v formation energy is actually fermi level dependent due to a charge transfer from the fermi level to the cluster when as@xmath9v forms . </S>",
    "<S> a higher fermi level results in lower cluster formation energies , and thus the as@xmath9v ( as ) curve becomes steeper ( flatter ) when the fermi level dependent formation energy is used . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ as : cas ] uses @xmath10 , which is appropriate for degenerately doped si .    </S>",
    "<S> .formation energy of as@xmath0v clusters . </S>",
    "<S> when the experimental vacancy formation energy is used ( 4.60 ev  @xcite ) , formation energies increase by about 1 ev . the experimental value of the v formation energy was calculated by subtracting the migration barrier ( 0.26 ev , dft value ) from the activation enthalpy ( 4.86 ev  @xcite ) . in the second row </S>",
    "<S> , the first value is based on the dft result , and the second is based on the experimental v formation energy . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ as : asbond ]    as shown in table  [ as : is ] , as is calculated to give a small lattice expansion . however , several authors have observed lattice contractions in heavily as - doped si , which they attributed to free electrons in the conduction band  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to their conclusion , dft calculations predict a lattice expansion due to free electrons in the conduction band ( table  [ as : ischarge ] ) . in cargill _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , the total induced strain ( @xmath11 ) is assumed to be given by the sum of the induced strain due to ions ( @xmath12 ) and free electrons ( @xmath13 ) . as shown in table  [ as : ischarge ] , the calculated induced strain due to as@xmath14 has opposite sign to measured value , but the absolute difference is small and thus its impact on stress effects is minimal . however , the reasoning is very different in each case , which raises a fundamental question about the role of electrons : do electrons cause expansion or contraction in the lattice ? to answer this question , we performed dft calculations to find equilibrium lattice constants of charged supercells . from the carrier concentration vs. change in lattice </S>",
    "<S> constant ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ as : straincharge ] ) , we conclude that electrons expand the lattice while holes cause lattice contraction .    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice expansion due to electrons raises another question about the relation between si - as bond length and the lattice parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we looked into the local structure around as in si matrix to answer this question . </S>",
    "<S> as listed in table  [ as : asbond ] , dft calculations agree with experimental measurement up to the 3nn distance and predict a local volume expansion around as  @xcite . however , this expansion is attenuated as distance increases and as - si 3nn spacing is very similar to si - si 3nn distance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , changes in the 1nn bond length are not directly linked to changes in the lattice parameter , and care should be taken when linking short range atomic spacing to lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as@xmath15 produces a lattice contraction ( @xmath16 ) in spite of longer as - si bond length . </S>",
    "<S> a free electron in the conduction / impurity band overcompensates this contraction , and thus neutral as results in an overall tiny expansion ( @xmath17 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the our analysis , it is likely that experimentally observed lattice contractions originate from reasons other than free electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute them to high concentrations of vacancies in the form of as@xmath0v@xmath1 clusters , and find that a vacancy concentration of about 15% of the as concentration can reproduce the lattice contraction observed by cargill et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this level of vacancy concentration was reported based on _ ab - initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations by berding _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and positron annihilation spectroscopy by borot _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> effects of stress on as and as@xmath0v concentrations are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ as : cstress ] based on eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ as : cepsilon ] and [ as : def ] . </S>",
    "<S> the concentrations of the two dominant configurations , as and as@xmath9v , undergo changes in opposite directions under biaxial stress , but the magnitude is minimal due to the small induced strain . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the free as concentration as a function of the total as concentration is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ as : asstress ] . at a given total as concentration , </S>",
    "<S> compressive biaxial stress enhances as@xmath0v formation , and thus the number of active as decreases . </S>",
    "<S> however , stress effects are minimal due to the small induced strains of dominant structures , in accordance with previous experiments  @xcite .    in conclusion , by performing dft calculations of the local structure around as in the silicon lattice </S>",
    "<S> , we found that lattice expansion due to the larger size of an as atom is limited to within 3nn distances . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice contraction in highly as - doped si can be explained by as@xmath0v cluster formation rather than free electron as previously suggested  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the small induced strain due to both isolated as and the dominant deactivated cluster as@xmath9v results in negligible stress effects on the carrier concentration , in accordance with experimental observations  @xcite </S>"
