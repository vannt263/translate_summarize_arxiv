    "from a reductionist perspective the statistical physics of a large number of dynamical systems in nature originates from nonlinear processes at the microscopic level . in many cases",
    "this leads to phenomena characterized in the literature by the terms of chaos , complexity , fractal geometry , and criticality .",
    "these scenarios are quite ubiquitous , thus not limited to basic physical systems , where turbulence comes to mind for example , but also to applications in biology , geology , social networks , economic systems , and finance , to name a few @xcite .",
    "the literature on the subject is prodigious .",
    "our current interest in the subject stems from a recent simulation of financial market dynamics @xcite . at the root of that study",
    "is a microscopic model based on the principal of gauge invariance , assuming that one of the key mechanisms of trader behavior is independent of any scale ( currency unit , for example ) used in the market transactions @xcite . in technical terms",
    "the model is a quantum field theory based on the gauge group @xmath0 , the dilation group , which implies scale invariance of the market model with respect to ordinary multiplication of prices with positive real numbers .",
    "the quantum aspect of that model implements the empirical observation that arbitrage opportunities , i.e. realizing a profit via transactions in different markets , vanish quickly because of market dynamics .    at this stage",
    ", the model does not provide a mechanism for describing a complex system , as it should , given the empirical evidence .",
    "the distribution of market returns , if analyzed appropriately @xcite , exhibits fat tails ( probabilities larger than gaussian ) the likes of which are observed in many high frequency financial markets .",
    "however , this is not a consequence of the intrinsic dynamics of the model . in order to remedy this situation , in the present article ,",
    "we study an abridged model with local interactions that lead to a self - organized complex market model .",
    "although our goal is to eventually combine the gauge model with features of the abridged model discussed here , the latter , despite its simplicity , produces salient characteristics of actual financial markets surprisingly well . among those are the semblance of return time series , returns frequency distributions , and the nature of volatility .",
    "the market volatility , in particular , is a subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "these features are promising enough to study this simple model in its own right , which is the subject of this work . along a one - dimensional lattice representing discrete time ,",
    "the field on the sites are interpreted as returns in a model market .",
    "an updating algorithm is then applied which is loosely fashioned after the well - known proposal by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the idea is to develop a market model that is driven by microscopic entities , say traders , such that their interaction leaves the lattice field in a self - organized critical ( soc ) state . in a critical state , among other things ,",
    "long - range correlations of suitable observables lead to power - law behavior with respect to scaling transformations .",
    "self organization means that the system is driven to criticality without fine - tuning any external parameters , i.e. solely by its intrinsic dynamics .",
    "it is generally realized that financial markets , being prime examples of social systems , exhibit soc @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , attempts to model those from a microscopic point of view are rare @xcite . in @xcite percolation clusters",
    "act as investors . assigning random percolation probabilities ,",
    "power law behavior is found for the usual observables derived from stock market prices @xcite .",
    "another example of such an attempt close to the btw evolution model is the work of bartolozzi et al @xcite . though close to our work in spirit ,",
    "significant differences exist in terms of the updating strategy and interpretation .",
    "our implementation of our lattice field model will produce price time series , returns and their distributions , volatility time series and their clustering features that are all strikingly similar to historical market data .",
    "why would one like to have a market model in the first place ?",
    "after all there are myriads of historical data being collected every day .",
    "a good reason is the fact that all of the collected data are merely instances of a random draw from some probability distribution , just like one throw of a dice gives only one number , hiding the statistics behind it .",
    "a stochastic model on the other hand will enable us to study any number of market instances , and collect ensembles in the language of statistical physics .",
    "observables , as averages endowed with errors , could be computed .",
    "ultimately , a successful model could provide probability distributions for future prices , and thus be an invaluable tool for risk analysis , and the like .",
    "we consider the simplest lattice market model conceivable , a one - dimensional chain of @xmath1 sites with labels @xmath2 , where @xmath3 indicates discrete time @xmath4 in steps of some arbitrary unit @xmath5 .",
    "the sites are populated with a real - valued field @xmath6 with components @xmath7 .",
    "when compared to @xcite , we use a minimalistic topology , and also ignore the gauge field living on the lattice links thus forgoing the minimization of arbitrage .",
    "as it turned out it is essential to interpret the field components @xmath8 directly as investment returns .",
    "the returns are defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the price of an investment instrument , such as a stock or index fund for example , and @xmath11 is a unit ( currency , shares , etc ) . the continuum version of ( [ eq1 ] ) can be surmised from taking the limit @xmath12 in @xmath13 where @xmath14 at @xmath4 .    in order to endow the field @xmath6",
    "with dynamics we find inspiration in the popular evolutionary model by bak and sneppen @xcite . in that context ,",
    "the field components are fitness values , say @xmath15 $ ] , assigned to the sites of a lattice .",
    "the updating process consists in finding the site @xmath16 with @xmath17 , i.e. the least adapted species .",
    "then @xmath18 and the values @xmath19 of the two next neighbors are replaced with uniformly distributed random numbers from @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "this prescription , when iterated many times @xmath21 , leads to a stationary state of the lattice field where a single perturbation can lead to a burst of activity , called an avalanche .",
    "the frequency distribution of avalanche sizes is found to follow a power law .",
    "a power law is a signature feature of a critical state .",
    "since no tuning of a model parameter is needed , the phenomenon is known as self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "the model is very robust in the sense that changing the updating prescription , within reasonable bounds , will still lead to soc .",
    "a rigorous discussion , containing analytical results , may be found in @xcite .    in the context of the financial market model",
    "we adopt a modified version of bak s updating prescription .",
    "we select periodic boundary conditions with period @xmath1 , such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in terms of the returns @xmath8 ,",
    "we define @xmath24 and call @xmath25 the signal of the field configuration @xmath6 .",
    "the updating strategy then proceeds with finding a site @xmath16 from @xmath26 and then replacing the returns on sites @xmath16 and its two neighbors according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are three random numbers drawn from a normal distribution @xmath30 while enforcing the constraint @xmath31 .",
    "the variance @xmath32 is a parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : lat1 ] illustrates the situation .",
    "within reason , we have experimented with numerous alternative definitions for the signal , defined through ( [ eq3a],[eq3b],[eq4 ] ) .",
    "overall , it appears that bak updating is very robust and soc is easily achieved .",
    "however , the choice ( [ eq3a],[eq3b],[eq4 ] ) proved to best match the stylized features of historical financial market data .",
    "although ( [ eq3a],[eq3b],[eq4 ] ) were mostly selected on empirical grounds , in retrospect , more motivation may be provided : note that ( [ eq3a ] ) is just a discretized version of @xmath33 where @xmath34 , in view of ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , has been identified with @xmath35 in finance , an established approach is to treat the returns @xmath34 as a stochastic process @xcite .",
    "returns are typically modeled by a ( generalized ) wiener process , i.e. assuming normal distributed random variables with a time dependent ( random ) variance @xmath36 - e[r(t)]^2\\ , , \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 $ ] indicates the stochastic expected value .",
    "discretized versions of the time derivatives of the two terms are @xmath38 = 2e[r(t)r^\\prime(t ) ] & \\simeq & \\langle r_j(r_{j+1}-r_{j-1})\\rangle \\delta^{-1 } \\label{eq10a}\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}e[r(t)]^2 = 2e[r(t)]e[r^\\prime(t ) ] & \\simeq & \\langle r_j \\rangle\\langle r_{j+1}-r_{j-1}\\rangle \\delta^{-1 } \\label{eq10b}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the right - hand sides , we have changed the notation for the expectation value from @xmath37 $ ] to @xmath39 , the latter indicating the averages for lattice generated returns . in the current simulation , standard stochastic financial modeling dictates that @xmath40 be independent of time .",
    "this implies that the discretized part of equation ( 12 ) is exactly equal to zero .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the lattice model is driven by eliminating extreme , sudden , changes of the variance on the returns deemed ` unfit ' in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "combining ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10a],[eq10b ] ) the lattice version of the latter turns out to be @xmath41\\delta^{-1 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the covariance of the two random variables .",
    "hence , extreme changes of the covariance of returns between adjacent time slices are discouraged as part of the dynamics of the market model .    as a side remark we comment on the use of the two - step time derivative to approximate @xmath43 in ( [ eq10a ] ) and ( [ eq10b ] ) as opposed to employing one - step forward @xmath44 , or backward @xmath45 , discretizations . in both cases",
    "the interaction ( [ eq3a ] ) , which drives the lattice dynamics , would mutate from a proper next - nearest - neighbor coupling to a term dominated by self - interactions @xmath46 .",
    "this does not lead to a sensible physical system , and demonstrably gives absurd results in a numerical simulation .",
    "the corresponding approximations to the time derivative of the variance @xmath47 are @xmath482\\delta^{-1}$ ] and @xmath492\\delta^{-1}$ ] , respectively .",
    "those are variance driven and , equally , not suitable to define market dynamics .",
    "finally , we should caution that the purpose of the above exposition is only to provide some motivation .",
    "in fact we should expect that the returns time series has fractal geometry .",
    "this makes perfect sense on a discretized time lattice , with the usual implications @xcite , but it certainly discourages using the concept of continuous time derivatives on everyday manifestations of market data . in this vein",
    "the lattice model , in combination with next - nearest - neighbor interactions , appears to be a rational approach .",
    "for good measure , we have chosen a lattice with @xmath50 time steps . starting with a random lattice field @xmath6 we show in fig .  [",

    "all lattice sites have local signals @xmath69 , see ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "as long as the avalanche lasts , there is at least one lattice site with a local signal larger than @xmath64 and thus the updating activity continues until @xmath70 .",
    "since the gap function is decreasing and bounded from below by zero it will eventually approach a constant @xmath71 . in this regime",

    "[ fig : flh1][fig : flh4 ] were chosen somewhat randomly , except that they were paired to point out common features appearing in both the lattice and historical sets .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : flh1 ] there is a clearly visible time interval around @xmath125 where the historical returns data exhibits a region of quenched volatility . in financial market data",
    "the phenomenon of volatility clustering is well known and even exploited as an industry standard modeling technique @xcite .",
    "periods of small / large volatility are often separated by price shocks that manifest themselves in large spikes of the volatility .",
    "this is clearly a common feature of both the historical and the lattice data sets of fig .",
    "[ fig : flh1 ] , best visible in the @xmath123 panels .",
    "the price evolutions are similar , but this is accidental .",
    "the lattice model generates up or down markets with equal probability .",
    "( although this can easily be changed by modifying the updating algorithm . )    the remaining sets exhibit the same characteristics .",
    "in set  2 , fig .  [",
    "fig : flh2 ] , we have paired lattice and historical data that share a small overall volatility .",
    "this demonstrates that the lattice model is capable of producing quiescent market periods as well .",
    "the price times series look strikingly similar , which is fallacious , the statistical model is not capable of making predictions .",
    "the subsequent sets  3 and 4 provide additional evidence that the lattice model is able to emulate stylized featured of real markets .",
    "again , volatility clusters are clearly present separated by spikes of various sizes . similarly , set  4 exhibits fairly active volatility patterns for both the lattice and the historical data .",
    "we now turn to the ability of our model to capture some of the well - known dynamics observed in financial markets .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of a financial time series is its volatility , and more importantly , how the volatility evolves over time .",
    "most financial time series exhibit time - varying volatility clustering , which means that periods of large swings tend to be followed by periods of large swings , while periods of calm tend to be followed by periods of calm .",
    "these dynamics can be modeled by the auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( arch ) model of engle @xcite and by its generalized version , the generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( garch ) model of bollerslev @xcite .",
    "the fact that these specifications imply that a large shock on average tends to be followed by another large shock means that the resulting distribution of returns will exhibit ` fat tails ' or higher - than - gaussian probability masses in the extreme regions .",
    "similarly , the fact that these specifications also imply that a small shock on average tends to be followed by another small shock means that the resulting distribution of returns will exhibit a higher - than - gaussian probability mass around the origin , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hd ] .",
    "arch and garch models have grown into incredibly popular tools as they are able to replicate these salient features of financial returns distributions , namely more probability mass in the tails and around the center of the distribution than in the benchmark gaussian case .",
    "capturing these features of financial markets is crucial for many purposes including but not limited to : derivatives pricing , hedging , forecasting volatility , portfolio management , regulatory issues , value - at - risk , and so on .",
    "the traditional arch specification expresses the current volatility level as a function of past squared shocks ( about a mean or average return ) at various lags .",
    "this implies that the volatility is not constant over time anymore but that it depends on how large recent deviations ( positive or negative ) from the mean have been . in the more general garch specification ,",
    "the current volatility level is still a function of past squared shocks to the returns , but it is also a function of past lagged levels of itself , thus making the model even more flexible .",
    "the garch(p , q ) specification for the volatility @xmath126 at time @xmath127 can be described by the following equation : @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath122 are the maximum lags allowed by the model for past shocks and volatility levels respectively , and @xmath130 is the return shock ( about the mean ) at lag @xmath131 .",
    "one can obviously allow @xmath129 and @xmath122 to be as large as one wants , but a garch(1,1 ) model in practice turns out to be surprisingly flexible . moreover , overfitting is often the recipe for poor out - of - sample performance , and parsimonious models often end up defeating more complex ones when tested outside of the in - sample period .",
    "hansen and lunde @xcite compare 330 ( g)arch - type models in terms of their ability to describe the conditional volatility of exchange rate and ibm return data , and find no evidence that a garch(1,1 ) is outperformed by more sophisticated models in the analysis .",
    "therefore we choose to focus on the parsimonious , yet very apt , garch(1,1 ) model for purposes of comparing the dynamics of time - varying volatility in our lattice - generated returns and in nasdaq historical returns .",
    "our model can thus be written as @xmath132    the goal here is twofold .",
    "first , it is to investigate whether our lattice model is able to produce returns volatility dynamics displaying some form , if any , of arch / garch effects .",
    "second , it is to examine whether our lattice model is able to produce returns volatility dynamics that are rather consistent with those of nasdaq historical returns . in figures [ fig : flh1 ] through [ fig : flh4 ] for each set l and n ( lattice and nasdaq returns ) , we fit a garch(1,1 ) model onto the returns data through a levenberg - marquardt optimization algorithm @xcite and report the results in tables [ tab : garch-1 ] through [ tab : garch-4 ] .    before getting to the tables",
    ", one may first notice that figures [ fig : flh1 ] through [ fig : flh4 ] display similar - looking sets of charts when one compares the lattice - generated graphs with the nasdaq historical ones .",
    "the top portion represents returns ( gains or losses ) over time , and one can readily see that there are clusters of volatility in each , indicating that the model seems to be capable of capturing them .",
    "the middle portion simply represents the evolution of the asset value over time .",
    "visually , the price dynamics generated by the lattice model appear ` plausible ' as those of a financial market such as the nasdaq .",
    "finally , the bottom plot represents the evolution of the volatility over time , for both the lattice and the nasdaq data . here",
    "again , the volatility patterns generated by the lattice model seem credible as those of financial markets , displaying a variety of spikes of various sizes and frequencies .    underneath the plots",
    ", each table displays the estimated parameters @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , followed by their standard errors in parenthesis and their t - statistics , in square brackets , for both the lattice and the nasdaq returns data . except for the nasdaq parameter @xmath133 in tab .",
    "[ tab : garch-4 ] , every parameter is statistically significant at the 5% significance level , and most parameters are even statistically significant at the 1% significance level .",
    "this indicates that both the nasdaq returns and our lattice - generated returns display arch / garch behavior in volatility .",
    "moreover , and more remarkably , the estimated parameters coming from our lattice - generated returns are extremely close , especially in magnitude , to the estimated parameters coming from the nasdaq historical returns . for instance , in tab .  [",
    "tab : garch-2 ] , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are estimated to be @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively for the lattice - generated model , while they are @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively for the nasdaq historical returns .",
    "although this does not indicate forecasting abilities on the part of the lattice model , it does show that it is able to reproduce , with precision , important financial markets volatility dynamics and thus has the potential to provide future insights on the inner mechanics of such markets .",
    "by their very nature , historical market data constitute only instances of some stochastic process .",
    "it is thus desirable to have available a stochastic model of a financial market . as a result ,",
    "such a model grants complete access to the market s stochastic features through the act of drawing multiple instances , or ensembles .",
    "this allows the possibility of a detailed investigation of market dynamics and the features that define them .",
    "we have studied the properties of a stochastic lattice model which by design derives its features from next - nearest - neighbor interactions of microscopic entities that live on a linear chain in discrete time .",
    "the model is realized as a lattice field theory with field components being interpreted as market returns , and is subject to computer simulation with an updating algorithm inspired by the evolution model by bak , tang and wiesenfeld @xcite that drives the lattice field into a self - organized critical state .",
    "we present evidence , including power law behavior , that the critical state is indeed achieved .",
    "its presence is the salient feature of the model .",
    "we compute time series of market returns , prices , volatilities , and returns frequency distributions , all of which are remarkably consistent with historical market data for the nasdaq stock index .",
    "in particular the ` fat tails ' feature of the returns distribution comes out effortlessly .",
    "it is worth noting that , aside from ( trivial ) units , the lattice model has no adjustable parameters .",
    "perhaps most remarkable is the observation that standard financial industry analysis tools , in our case the garch(1,1 ) model @xcite , produce fits that make the lattice model time series almost indistinguishable from real financial market data .",
    "it seems that the most important conclusion derived from our study is that self - organized criticality , being a fundamental driving force for the model , is also key to characterizing real world financial markets .",
    "to say the least , self - organized criticality should be an important component of intrinsic market dynamics , allowing us to model financial instruments using lattice methods which may hopefully be competitive with current industry practice .",
    "of course , self - organization is surely not the only mechanism that drives financial market dynamics . among other things",
    ", trading occurs within a background of arbitrage opportunities @xcite .",
    "we are looking forward to combining past studies focused on arbitrage @xcite with the present model in order to develop an even more realistic stochastic market model .",
