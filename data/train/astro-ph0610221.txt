    "solar torsional oscillations have been known to exist for more than two decades .",
    "@xcite presented the first observations of torsional oscillations using mt .",
    "wilson doppler measurements and pointed out the 11 year periodicity and the relation to the solar cycle .",
    "these early observations showed only the equatorward propagating branch at low latitudes .",
    "the high latitude branch ( above @xmath1 ) , which is in amplitude at least twice as strong as the equatorward propagating branch , was found more recently through helioseismic measurements by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these inversions also show that the high latitude signal penetrates almost all the way to the base of the convection zone .",
    "the depth penetration of the low latitude signal is more uncertain due to the lower amplitude , which is comparable to the uncertainties of the inversion methods in the lower half of the convection zone .",
    "the most interesting feature of the low latitude branch is an inclination of the phase with respect to the rotation axis by about @xmath2 .",
    "this inclination is very close to the inclinations of the isorotation contours of @xmath3 as pointed out by @xcite .    on the theoretical side a variety of explanations",
    "have been proposed : macroscopic lorentz force feedback , microscopic lorentz force feedback , and thermal forcing .",
    "the idea of macroscopic lorentz force feedback ( computed from the large scale magnetic mean field of the solar dynamo ) was originally proposed by @xcite and @xcite and has been incorporated into dynamo models more recently by @xcite . while these models address the non - linear lorentz force feedback using a simplified equations of motion ( considering only the longitudinal component ) , models by @xcite and @xcite consider the lorentz force feedback also in the meridional plane . the model of @xcite , @xcite is along the lines of the @xmath4-models by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( coupling mean field models for differential rotation , meridional flow and magnetic field evolution ) , but puts more emphasis on the role of the meridional flow leading to a flux - transport dynamo ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review on the development of flux - transport dynamos ) .",
    "microscopic lorentz force feedback ( quenching of turbulent transport processes driving differential rotation @xmath5-quenching ) has been addressed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "very recently @xcite proposed a thermal origin of the low latitude branch of torsional oscillations , driven through enhanced radiative losses in the active region belt .",
    "this theory also predicts an inflow into the active region belt , which has been observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the investigation presented here is based on the model of @xcite ; however we take a different approach by decoupling the excitation of torsional oscillations from a detailed dynamo model .",
    "we use the differential rotation model of @xcite and force torsional oscillations through mechanical and thermal perturbations to address the question of what type of forcing is required to get a response comparable to the observed torsional oscillations .",
    "we emphasize that this is not a fully self - consistent explanation of torsional oscillations since we do not incorporate a full dynamo model also considering the non - linear feedback of zonal and meridional flow variations on the magnetic field evolution .",
    "we have published such a self - consistent non - linear dynamo model ( based on a flux - transport dynamo and the same differential rotation model we use in this paper ) in @xcite .",
    "we found that many features of torsional oscillations discussed in that paper are more general , meaning independent from a particular dynamo model .",
    "the goal of this paper is to point out these general properties that are strongly related to influence of the taylor - proudman theorem on amplitude and phase of torsional oscillations .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on the differential rotation model developed by @xcite .",
    "this model is an axisymmetric mean field model incorporating a parametrization of turbulent angular momentum transport @xmath5-effect @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details of this model . for this investigation",
    "we use a reference model close to the model used in @xcite , with the minor difference of using a larger value of @xmath6 for the superadiabaticity in the overshoot region ( leading to more solar like differential rotation in terms of inclination of the isorotation contours ) .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the differential rotation and the meridional flow stream function for the reference model .",
    "torsional oscillations can be driven in general through mechanical forcing ( lorentz force ) or thermal forcing ( pressure imbalances drive geostrophic flows in a rotating system ) .",
    "most investigations so far focused on the role of the longitudinal lorentz force , neglecting azimuthal components . this can be partially justified by the fact that the toroidal field is significantly stronger than the poloidal field in an @xmath7 dynamo , leading also to a dominant component of the lorentz force in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the azimuthal component could be important for explaining ( observed ) deviations from the taylor - proudman state through a magnetostrophic balance ; however , as we show later , this is unlikely to happen in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "thermal forcing is very efficient in that reproducing the observed amplitude requires only temperature fluctuations of a few tenth of a degree , which can be derived from a geostrophic balance . assuming a latitudinal balance between coriolis force and pressure force gives : @xmath8 which leads to @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the reference state rotation rate , @xmath11 the perturbation ( torsional oscillation )",
    ", @xmath12 is the gas constant , @xmath13 the mean molecular weight , @xmath14 the radius , and @xmath15 the co - latitude . adopting solar values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( width of active region belt ) and @xmath20",
    ", we get @xmath21 this value is consistent with the temperature perturbation of @xmath22 to @xmath23 k @xcite imposed in their model to drive the low latitude branch of torsional oscillations .",
    "we emphasize that the total temperature perturbation is nearly independent of depth for a fixed torsional oscillation amplitude , meaning that the relative perturbation close to the surface is around @xmath24 ( the same value was given by @xcite ) , but only around @xmath25 close to the base of the convection zone .",
    "the following questions will be addressed in this investigation :    1 .   are torsional oscillations of thermal or mechanical origin ? 2 .   are they a consequence of traveling or periodic perturbations in the solar convection zone ?",
    "we focus our discussion separately on the high latitude and low latitude branch for reasons that will become more evident in the following discussion .",
    "the high latitude branch has a larger amplitude than the low latitude branch and is propagating poleward , while the low latitude branch is clearly following the equatorward propagating magnetic activity belt .",
    "this leads to the fundamental question of whether the poleward branch is also associated with a poleward propagating magnetic pattern at the base of the convection zone ( as it has been seen in many interface dynamos ) , which is not visible at the solar surface .",
    "we can not rule out such a possibility here , but we will show that this is not conclusive and the poleward propagation can be explained as a response of the coupled differential rotation meridional flow system to a non - traveling periodic perturbation in mid - latitudes . to demonstrate this , we incorporate in the differential rotation model a mechanical ( in the equation for @xmath3 ) or thermal ( in the entropy equation ) forcing term of the form @xmath26 here @xmath27 corresponds to a @xmath28 year periodicity ( as observed for torsional oscillations ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the amplitudes of the forcing , and @xmath31 is a gaussian profile of the form : @xmath32\\cdot      \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\theta_0}{\\delta \\theta}\\right)^2\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] we use for all following models the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and vary the co - latitude between @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . for the results presented here",
    "the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 are of secondary concern ( as long as @xmath39 ) .",
    "we have chosen values leading to torsional oscillations of a few percent of the rotation rate .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows on the left side models with mechanical forcing and on the right side models with thermal forcing . from top to bottom , the latitude of the forcing is varied between @xmath1 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "independent of the nature of the periodic forcing , all models show a strong poleward propagating pattern and a very weak equatorward propagating pattern away from the latitude at which the forcing is applied .",
    "the equatorward pattern increases in amplitude when the location of the forcing is moved closer to the equator .",
    "the pattern typically shows two peaks , one close to the latitude of the forcing and one right at the pole ( with larger amplitude ) .",
    "comparing the latitudinal extent of the pattern on the polar side of the forcing region with observations , a forcing location in mid - latitudes seems most reasonable .",
    "the time for the signal to travel from about @xmath1 to the pole is @xmath42 to @xmath43 years , which is close to the observed propagation speed .",
    "it turns out that the travel time is primarily affected by the turbulent viscosity assumed in the reference model , which is shown in figure [ f3 ] . to this end",
    "we compare two models with the viscosity values of @xmath0 ( panel a ) and @xmath44 ( panel b ) .",
    "we have adjusted in each model the amplitude and the direction of the turbulent angular momentum transport ( @xmath5-effect ) such that the differential rotation and meridional flow remain roughly unchanged .",
    "the propagation time for the signal drops from around @xmath42 to @xmath45 year when the turbulent viscosity is increased by a factor of @xmath43 . since solar observations show a time delay of @xmath42 to @xmath43 years , this sets constraints on the value of the turbulent viscosity . in our model",
    "we get the best fit for values @xmath46 .",
    "this value is around one order of magnitude smaller than mixing - length estimates for the solar convection zone , it agrees however with the results of @xcite taking into account rotational quenching of turbulent viscosity .",
    "panel c ) shows the same model as panel a ) but the meridional flow is not allowed to change in response to the zonal flow variation ( we solve only the equation for @xmath11 and keep the meridional flow fixed ) .",
    "this leads to a significantly different flow pattern : the maximum amplitude is found close to the forcing region and the propagation of the signal toward the pole slows down . in this way",
    "the variation of the meridional flow has a significant influence on the structure of the torsional oscillation pattern .",
    "interestingly , the meridional flow of the reference state is not important , only the induced flow variation . constructing a model with the same value of the turbulent viscosity , but a different meridional flow , leads to a nearly identical zonal flow pattern ( difference in the @xmath47 range ) .",
    "panel d ) shows the meridional flow variation associated with the poleward moving zonal flow pattern shown in panel a ) .",
    "a solar like amplitude of around @xmath43 nhz for the torsional oscillation leads to a meridional flow variation of around @xmath48 .    to our knowledge",
    "this is so far the only way to constrain the turbulent viscosity directly by observations , without having to relate it to the magnetic diffusivity by making assumptions about the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "we emphasize that our model assumes a constant value throughout the convection zone . in models with",
    "a depth dependent viscosity the above mentioned value should reflect more the values in the lower half of the convection zone rather than the surface layers , since they contribute more to the angular momentum transport due to their larger density .    from the results shown in figure [ f2 ] it is difficult to judge whether it is possible to distinguish between a mechanical or thermal forcing .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows meridional cross - sections of the zonal flow pattern .",
    "the most obvious difference here is that the mechanical forcing leads to torsional oscillations more aligned with the rotation axis ( taylor - proudman theorem ) , while thermal forcing shows a tendency to produce more radially aligned patterns . beside aligning structures with the rotation axis",
    ", the taylor - proudman constraint also leads to an almost constant amplitude within the convection zone , while in the case of thermal forcing the entropy perturbations allow for more variation of the amplitude as function of depth .    in the case of the high latitude branch the observations are not detailed enough to distinguish between thermal and mechanical forcing ( this may be because in high latitudes the radial direction almost coincides with the axis of rotation )",
    ". we will show in the next section that there is a significant difference between mechanical and thermal forcing effects in low latitudes .",
    "the most striking feature of the low latitude branch is the systematic deviation from the taylor - proudman state .",
    "as first pointed out by @xcite , the lines of constant phase show an inclination of @xmath2 to the axis of rotation , similar to the isorotation contours of the differential rotation .",
    "we present here a few idealized experiments to differentiate between possible mechanical and thermal forcing . to this end",
    "we construct a mechanical forcing function and a cooling function that has a @xmath2 inclination angle with respect to the axis of rotation . for reasons of simplicity",
    "we apply here a stationary perturbation for a time interval of a few month to illustrate the effect .",
    "the forcing functions are given by : @xmath49\\label{mech_lowlat}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial t}&=&\\ldots+a_{s}\\ , g(r,\\theta ) \\label{therm_lowlat}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50    \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\cdot\\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\zeta(r)}{\\delta \\theta}\\right)^2\\right ]    \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath51 specifies the inclination of the forcing with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "assuming that @xmath52 is the location of the forcing at @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the inclination angle we get : @xmath55\\label{phase}\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath52 determines the co - latitude of the perturbation at the radius @xmath53 , where @xmath53 marks the depth at which the forcing decreases to half of the convection zone value .",
    "we use in the following discussion common values of @xmath34 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) for mechanical ( thermal ) forcing , respectively .    to compare results for forcing functions extending through the entire convection zone with those from surface forcing functions",
    ", we will use in both cases the parameters @xmath59 ( co - latitude ) ; and @xmath60 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 are chosen so that applying the forcing for a time interval of about @xmath43 months leads to an amplitude of the zonal flow of a few nhz .",
    "all results shown in the following discussion show the zonal flow after @xmath43 months of mechanical or thermal forcing .    the forcing function for the mechanical forcing eq . ( [ mech_lowlat ] )",
    "is multiplied by the term @xmath61 $ ] in order to produce a perturbation that has a faster zonal flow equatorward and slower zonal flow poleward of the region the forcing is applied . in the case of the thermal forcing this is not required , since the response to a cooling automatically leads to the formation of two geostrophic flows with opposite directions .",
    "figure [ f5 ] summarizes the results obtained with mechanical forcing , figure [ f6 ] the results from thermal forcing . in the case of mechanical forcing the zonal flows",
    "do not resemble the properties of the forcing function ( especially the @xmath2 inclination ) unless meridional flow variations are completely suppressed as shown in figure [ f5]a ) and c ) .",
    "if meridional flow variations are considered , the zonal flow pattern shows strong influence of rotation , aligning the pattern with the axis of rotation ( taylor - proudman theorem ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting flow is entirely dominated by the influence of rotation and does not resemble the properties of the applied forcing function . since the pattern has the tendency to spread parallel to the axis of rotation , a perturbation traveling at the base of the convection zone ( @xmath62 ) from @xmath41 latitude toward the equator , would produce close to the surface a pattern moving from around @xmath63 to @xmath64 and could therefore not explain the observed low latitude branch of the observed torsional oscillations . even applying the forcing close to the surface does not lead to a reasonable flow pattern as shown in figure [ f5]d ) .",
    "this result is not too surprising , since adding a forcing in the @xmath65 direction does not impact the meridional force balance that leads to the taylor - proudman state .",
    "this raises the question if additional magnetic stresses in the meridional plane could cause a deviation from the taylor - proudman state as observed ( magnetostrophic balance ) . in a typical @xmath7-model for the solar dynamo ,",
    "the poloidal field is at least a factor of @xmath66 weaker than the toroidal field . having a toroidal field strength of around @xmath45 t ( @xmath67 kg ) @xcite , this yields around @xmath68 t ( @xmath66 g ) for the poloidal field .",
    "an estimate similar to eq .",
    "( [ geostrophic ] ) leads in the case of a magnetostrophic balance to @xmath69 here we assumed that the @xmath15-component of the lorentz force can be estimated as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes the poloidal field strength . adopting solar values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and we get @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the density at the base of the convection zone .",
    "these values indicate that a magnetostrophic balance is very unlikely in the bulk of the convection zone , but very close to the surface , where the density is very low , it can not be ruled out ( for a typical solar model we have @xmath74 at @xmath75 and @xmath76 at @xmath77 ) .",
    "there are additional terms of the lorentz force in the meridional plane that include the much stronger toroidal field : the gradient of the magnetic pressure and magnetic tension force arising from spherical geometry @xmath78 .",
    "the latter can lead to a prograde jet within the magnetized region as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , but not to a flow pattern with two opposite flows on both sides of the active region belt .    in order to address the influence of magnetic pressure ,",
    "we show in eq .",
    "( [ tpt ] ) the @xmath65 component of the vorticity equation considering a stationary flow and neglecting viscous stresses ( we also neglect here the magnetic tension force for the reason mentioned above ) : @xmath79 note that this equation addresses the deviation of the full differential rotation from taylor - proudman state .",
    "therefore @xmath80 also contains entropy perturbations associated with the reference state differential rotation . writing @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where the subscript r refers to the reference state and the subscript t to the torsional oscillation part",
    ", we get in leading order : @xmath83 here the first term on the left hand side is the dominant one ( typically at least a factor of @xmath84 larger than the second one for the examples discussed here ) , relating directly the @xmath85 derivative of @xmath86 to the entropy perturbation and magnetic pressure . therefore , if the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tpt2 ] ) is zero , the torsional oscillation pattern has to be very close to the taylor - proudman state with @xmath87 .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath88 together with @xmath89 means that a toroidal magnetic field with neutral magnetic buoyancy does not lead to any deviation from the taylor - proudman state .",
    "if magnetic buoyancy is not compensated , magnetic pressure causes a flow pattern with two opposite flows on both sides of the active region belt ; however , they would have the wrong sign ( fast moving band on poleward side , slow moving on equatorward side ; see also the discussion in next paragraph ) when we make the reasonable assumption that the active region belt has a higher magnetic pressure than the surrounding region .",
    "we will show in the following paragraph that a reasonable flow perturbation results from the assumption that the active region belt has lower gas pressure , which can be the consequence of a thermal perturbation .",
    "the zonal flow presented in figure [ f6]b ) shows the @xmath2 inclination angle imposed through the thermal forcing function . even though the forcing function is symmetric with respect to the latitude of the maximum ( given by @xmath90 ) ,",
    "the resulting zonal flows show a significant asymmetry , with the equatorward faster rotating band more confined than the poleward slower rotating band .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that eq .",
    "( [ tpt ] ) considers the radial and the latitudinal component of the coriolis force together .",
    "the relative contribution of both components depends on the latitude . in high latitudes we have @xmath91 , resulting in a symmetric flow pattern with the slower rotating band poleward and the faster rotating band equatorward , while in low latitudes we have @xmath92 leading to a solution @xmath93 , showing only a fast rotating band centered around the cooling region . in mid - latitudes",
    "the solution is a combination of both , with having a stronger fast rotating band that is also more close to the center of the cooling region . applying the thermal forcing only to the surface , as shown figure [ f6]d ) ,",
    "produces a zonal flow perturbation that is much more confined to the surface ; the @xmath2 inclination is less visible in this case .",
    "this study shows that it is much easier to produce a zonal flow pattern with the observed properties of the low latitude torsional oscillations through thermal forcing rather than mechanical forcing , but it does not explain the observed @xmath2 inclination angle , since this angle has to be imposed on the thermal forcing function .",
    "this could be a consequence of anisotropic thermal heat diffusivity that is larger parallel than perpendicular to the axis of rotation @xcite .",
    "a thermal signal imposed at the surface , as suggested by @xcite , would therefore not penetrate radially into the convection zone but rather in an angle more aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "another possible explanation could be a combination of mechanical and thermal forcing .",
    "to illustrate this , we computed in figure [ f7 ] a zonal flow resulting from both types of forcing .",
    "panel a ) shows the result of the mechanical forcing alone , panel b ) the result of the thermal forcing . in both cases we used @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "the forcing functions show a radial alignment ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the zonal flow in a ) and b ) is roughly the same .",
    "applying mechanical and thermal forcing together results in a zonal flow with roughly @xmath2 inclination with respect to the axis of rotation .    in this section",
    "we focused entirely on static forcing functions , not addressing the equatorward propagation of the signal in the course of the solar cycle .",
    "this could be easily addressed by incorporating a time dependent phase into eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) ; however , this does not impact the conclusions of this section concerning the importance of the taylor - proudman theorem , since the timescale for the establishment of the taylor - proudman state is significantly shorter than the solar cycle .",
    "we present in this paper a series of numerical experiments addressing the question of what type of forcing is required to produce a zonal flow variation showing the properties of the observed solar torsional oscillations . since this study is independent from a specific dynamo model , we can infer a few general conclusions about torsional oscillations and their possible origin :    1 .",
    "the taylor - proudman theorem applies also to perturbations of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore it is crucial to solve in models addressing the origin of torsional oscillations the full momentum equation , including variations of the meridional flow .",
    "2 .   mechanically forced zonal flows always have the tendency to spread through the entire convection zone parallel to the axis of rotation .",
    "3 .   significant deviations from the taylor - proudman state ( as observed in low latitudes )",
    "require thermal perturbations .",
    "a pure mechanical origin of the low latitude torsional oscillations is very unlikely .",
    "4 .   the fact that the phase of the torsional oscillation signal in low latitudes is inclined such that the signal occurs for a fixed latitude at the base of the convection around 2 years prior to the surface signal does not indicate necessarily that the origin has to be at the base of the convection zone .",
    "this is a consequence of the influence of rotation .",
    "the high latitude branch of torsional oscillations does not require a forcing propagating poleward in the course of the solar cycle .",
    "a poleward propagating zonal flow pattern is the natural response of the coupled differential rotation / meridional flow system to a periodic forcing ( mechanical or thermal ) in mid - latitudes .",
    "6 .   the poleward propagation speed of the torsional oscillation pattern is only determined by the value of the turbulent viscosity of the reference model .",
    "best agreement is found for values of @xmath97 less than @xmath0 .",
    "recently @xcite showed that the macroscopic lorentz force in a flux transport dynamo leads to a periodic source in mid - latitudes , where the poloidal magnetic field is sheared by the differential rotation while getting transported downward by the meridional flow .",
    "the model provides a poleward propagating branch with the correct amplitude and phase relation to the magnetic cycle . unlike some of the processes listed below",
    ", this type of feedback is unavoidable for a dynamo that is energetically driven through differential rotation .",
    "@xcite showed that the amplitude of the solar torsional oscillations is consistent with a dynamo that converts around @xmath98 of energy and produces around @xmath99 kg of toroidal field at the base of the convection zone .",
    "a different model was presented recently by @xcite .",
    "their model uses the observed solar rotation profile and allows for perturbations around this profile by considering the longitudinal component of the macroscopic lorentz force , while the azimuthal component of the momentum equation is neglected ( no meridional flow is considered ) .",
    "their results show torsional oscillations with both branches driven by the lorentz force that have a remarkable agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "even though most of the magnetic activity is in their model concentrated in low latitudes , there are also magnetic field patterns moving poleward together with the torsional oscillation pattern .",
    "we showed in this paper that a poleward propagating magnetic pattern is not required to drive the high latitude torsional oscillations , but on the other hand we can not rule out such a possibility based on the results we presented here .",
    "it would require a more detailed analysis of their model to determine whether the poleward propagating magnetic activity is the main driver or a response to a periodic forcing in mid - latitudes as shown by @xcite .",
    "as far as it concerns the low latitude branch of torsional oscillations we expect a significant influence of rotation , which is not present in a model not considering self - consistently the meridional flow .",
    "the alignment of the phase with the rotation axis makes it difficult to obtain a surface pattern of torsional oscillations propagating all the way to the equator especially if the lorentz force action takes place in the lower part of the convection zone ( which is the case in a dynamo model living mainly on the radial shear in the tachocline ) .",
    "this situation is comparable to the development of mean field models for differential rotation more than a decade ago . while early models that were not considering the meridional flow got a remarkable agreement with observations , later models solving all components of the momentum equation ended up in the taylor - proudman state .",
    "the problem is still under discussion , even though most people agree now that thermal perturbations explain the observed profile of the solar differential rotation @xcite . in our experience",
    "it is much more difficult to explain the low latitude torsional oscillations when the azimuthal components of the momentum equation are considered .",
    "the situation is different for the high latitude branch , since there the alignment of perturbations with the axis of rotation does not impose such a strong constraint .",
    "@xcite proposed that the torsional oscillations are a response to enhanced radiative losses in the active region belt due to small scale magnetic flux elements .",
    "@xcite parametrized this idea and showed that the cooling of the active region belt drives a zonal flow that is , at least close to the surface , in good agreement with observations .",
    "also meridional flow changes , corresponding to an inflow into the active region belt , reasonably agree with observations @xcite .",
    "however , the flow pattern deeper in the convection zone does not show the correct phase relation and depth dependence , which is most likely a consequence of the simple diffusive treatment of thermal perturbations .",
    "better agreement could be achieved if the thermal perturbation imposed in the surface layers penetrates deep enough and is also influenced by anisotropic diffusivity to yield the observed inclinations with respect to the axis of rotation",
    ".      due to the very small amplitude of temperature perturbations required for driving zonal flows it seems conceivable that quenching of convective energy flux by the dynamo generated field can also cause thermal shadows within the convection zone resulting in zonal flows .",
    "contrary to the process proposed by @xcite , these temperature perturbations would originate close to the base of the convection zone , where the strongest magnetic field is found .",
    "again , an anisotropic convective energy flux would be required to explain the observed phase relation .",
    "microscopic lorentz force feedback in terms of quenching of turbulent transport processes driving differential rotation has been addressed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as possible explanation for torsional oscillations .",
    "since @xmath5-quenching leads to an additional source term in the equation for @xmath3 , this is a mechanical forcing similar to macroscopic lorentz force feedback .",
    "therefore all the results discussed above for mechanical forcing also apply in this case .",
    "it has been speculated whether the similar inclination of the phase of the torsional oscillation pattern and the isorotation contours is a coincidence or not .",
    "none of the processes discussed here would necessarily lead to a similar angle ; however , the physical cause behind both , a thermally induced deviation from the taylor - proudman state , is similar .",
    "this work originated from discussions with manfred schssler during a visit of the author at the max - planck institute for solar - system - research in katlenburg - lindau , germany .",
