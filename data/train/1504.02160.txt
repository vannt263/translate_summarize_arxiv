    "the collision of two fast moving heavy nuclei produces a new form of matter , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it consists of deconfined quarks and gluons , and in the early years qgp was thought to behave like a weakly - interacting gas .",

    "the evolution of this strongly coupled qgp is well described by hydrodynamics , which successfully reproduced and even predicted the experimentally observed transverse momentum spectra and flow anisotropies of emitted hadrons .",
    "the validity of hydrodynamics relies on the matter being close to local thermal equilibrium . within a purely hydrodynamic approach that ignores details about how the system approaches equilibrium , the observed large hadron momentum anisotropy can only be explained if thermalization happens fast and the hydrodynamic expansion does not begin later than about 1fm/@xmath6 after the two nuclei impact each other @xcite",
    "this finding calls for a mechanism to explain how the matter produced in the collision can thermalize so fast . recently ,",
    "significant work has been done on modeling the thermalization process during the pre - equilibrium stage @xcite .",
    "while these studies have not yet fully explained the rapid thermalization , some of them have indicated that pre - equilibrium evolution can have a non - negligible influence on the final observables .    in this paper , we return to the question of how quickly thermalization must happen for a hydrodynamic approach to provide a successful description of experimental data , by studying the weakly interacting limit of pre - equilibrium dynamics . freely streaming",
    "partonic quanta can be considered as the extreme limit of a weakly interacting system and the diametrically opposite to a fluid dynamical description which requires strong coupling . by coupling a free - streaming pre - equilibrium stage to hydrodynamics and varying the switching time @xmath2",

    "we are interested in finding the largest @xmath2 value that is compatible with phenomenology . replacing the non - interacting free - streaming parton stage in our model by a model in which the matter constituents interact more realistically with modest interaction strength",
    "should allow for an earlier transition to hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "for this reason we expect our approach to yield a robust upper limit , for a fixed viscosity during the subsequent hydrodynamic stage , for the time at which the matter created in the collision must have reached a sufficient degree of local equilibrium to be described hydrodynamically .",
    "the dependence of this upper limit on the viscosity in the hydrodynamic stage will also be explored .",
    "it was initially thought that substituting the earliest stage in a hydrodynamic evolution model by a free - streaming gas would delay the buildup of thermodynamic pressure and thus reduce the finally observed collective flow @xcite . this ignored , however , the fact that in a spatially inhomogeneous medium free - streaming ( or , for that matter , any kind of pre - equilibrium evolution ) generates strong position - momentum correlations which , upon thermalization , lead to strong initial flow in the hydrodynamic stage .",

    "these large starting values for the shear stress decrease quickly on a short microscopic time scale , due to the assumed low shear viscosity @xmath3 of the hydrodynamic fluid .    on the way we had to solve the problem that extended free - streaming leads to a loss of a significant fraction of the energy of the expanding fireball because the volume of the `` corona '' of dilute matter that never thermalizes and therefore never becomes part of the hydrodynamic fluid increases . while we are not able to convert corona partons into hadrons we can account for their energy , so we can include them in anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath205 that characterize the azimuthal anisotropy of the energy flow even if we can not account for their contributions to anisotropic particle flow @xmath207 .",
    "we demonstrated that for small switching times were corona losses can be neglected , @xmath205 and @xmath207 closely track each other .",
    "our most important finding is that , contrary to traditional believes ( previously also held by one of the present authors ) , the anisotropic flow coefficients are not very sensitive to the thermalization ( or switching ) time as long as the latter does not significantly exceeed about 2fm/@xmath6 .",
    "the reason is that anisotropic flow not generated in the hydrodynamic stage , due a reduced initial fireball eccentricity and shortened hydrodynamic stage when @xmath2 is allowed to grow large , is almost precisely compensated for by anisotropies in the space - momentum correlations that develop during the free - streaming phase and manifest themselves as non - zero starting values for the momentum anisotropy of the energy - momentum tensor in the hydrodynamic stage . on the other hand",
    ", we found that an extended weakly coupled pre - equilibrium stage leads to stronger radial flow at the end of the hydrodynamic evolution , caused by large initial flow at the beginning of the hydrodynamic stage which is stronger than it would have been if the pre - equilibrium stage had been strongly coupled ( i.e. describable by hydrodynamics ) .",
    "this is a result of the faster signal propagation speed in the pre - equilibrium stage which , in the free - streaming case , is given by the speed of light and thus exceeds the hydrodynamic speed of sound by almost a factor 2 .",
    "this kick - start of the radial flow by pre - equilibrium evolution overcompensates the loss of radial flow generated during the hydrodynamic stage which is shortened when the pre - equilibrium stage lasts longer .",
    "it thus turns out that the mean transverse momentum @xmath241 of the finally emitted hadrons , which ( especially for the massive baryons ) is strongly affected by the final radial flow of the fireball , provides a stronger upper limit on the thermalization time @xmath2 than the anisotropic flow coefficients .",
    "this agrees with recent findings by romatschke and collaborators @xcite .    of course",
    ", the switching time @xmath2 is only one of several model parameters affecting the final observables . in the last section we therefore performed an extended parameter search where we varied the switching time , decoupling temperature and specific shear viscosity of the fluid simultaneously , for two different initial state models and both runs with and without pre - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "while this does not exhaust the list of parameters and possibilities this exercise provides a more holistic picture of the effects of pre - equiibrium dynamics on final observables and on the values of medium parameters extracted from a comparison of the model predictions with experimental data .",
    "we found for both initial state models that accounting for pre - equilibrium dynamics slightly increases the optimal values for the specific shear viscosity @xmath3 extracted from mean @xmath41 and anisotropic flow measurements and reduces the sensitivity of the observables to the decoupling temperature .",
    "however , the extracted limits for the thermalization time @xmath2 turned out to depend sensitively on the model for the initial density profiles .",

    "<S> in order to investigate the importance of pre - equilibrium dynamics on relativistic heavy - ion collision observables , we match a highly non - equilibrium early evolution stage , modeled by free - streaming partons generated from the monte carlo kharzeev - levin - nardi ( mc - kln ) and monte carlo glauber ( mc - glb ) models , to a locally approximately thermalized later evolution stage described by viscous hydrodynamics , and study the dependence of final hadronic transverse momentum distributions , in particular their underlying radial and anisotropic flows , on the switching time between these stages . performing a 3-parameter fit of the measured values for the average transverse momenta @xmath0 for pions , kaons and protons as well as the elliptic and triangular flows of charged hadrons @xmath1 , with the switching time @xmath2 , the specific shear viscosity @xmath3 during the hydrodynamic stage , and the kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath4 as free parameters , we find that the preferred `` thermalization '' times @xmath2 depend strongly on the model of the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> mc - kln initial conditions require an earlier transition to hydrodynamic behavior ( at @xmath5 0.13 fm/@xmath6 ) , followed by hydrodynamic evolution with a larger specific shear viscosity @xmath7 0.2 , than mc - glb initial conditions which prefer switching at a later time ( @xmath8 0.6 fm/@xmath6 ) followed by a less viscous hydrodynamic evolution with @xmath7 0.16 . </S>",
    "<S> these new results including pre - equilibrium evolution are compared to fits without a pre - equilbrium stage where all dynamic evolution before the onset of hydrodynamic behavior is ignored . in each case , the quality of the dynamical descriptions for the optimized parameter sets , as well as the observables which show the strongest constraining power for the thermalization time , are discussed . </S>"
