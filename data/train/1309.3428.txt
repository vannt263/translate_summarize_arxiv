    "at first glance , pulsars and dark matter appear to have nothing in common , the former are magnificent spinning neutron stars with impeccable timing @xcite , while the latter embodies the most profound mystery at the crossroads of gravity and particle physics @xcite .",
    "but , on closer inspection , one actually realises that they share more than meets the eye .",
    "@xcite recognised this seemingly innocuous conflict when they noted that pulsars would be one of the biggest obstacle to proving a dark mater astrophysical signal .",
    "an avalanche of recent results has just reinforced the ambiguity @xcite .",
    "this would be purely anecdotal were it not for the fact that we have not identified a dark matter culprit .",
    "the underlying reason is that pulsars and dark matter are predicted to share similar spectral signatures with sharp cutoffs , despite dramatically different astrophysical origins . around pulsars , gamma - ray photons",
    "are emitted via curvature radiation of accelerated particles with an exponential cutoff at the maximum curvature energy around a few gev @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a number of dark matter models predict that cosmic dark particles will annihilate into known elementary particles that will subsequently generate secondary photons .",
    "the resulting gamma - ray spectrum should show a cutoff near the dark matter particle mass @xmath1 @xcite .    this issue has come to bear on current searches for dark matter in the purlieus of the galactic centre .",
    "the central concentration of dark matter is arguably the most promising place to search for unusual annihilation products .",
    "as it turns out , over the past few years a number of groups have noticed the presence of excess gev emission around the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "whilst these results are possible breakthroughs in dark matter research , the region over which the excess gev emission has been found is scientifically daunting with local sources of diffuse emission and unresolved gamma - ray emitters that can easily sequester any secondary emission associated with dark matter .",
    "procedurally , a final confirmation of dark matter annihilation must exclude all other available astrophysical explanations . exploiting the spectral shape of the excess gev emission ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have concluded that known gamma - ray pulsars can not account for such a signal .",
    "most arguments against pulsars have been built around the premise that the spectral shape of _ fermi _ pulsars ( @xmath2 ) can not account for the much harder ( @xmath3 ) spectrum of the gev excess @xcite .",
    "these studies lead to the seemingly unavoidable conclusion that we are detecting dark matter annihilation .",
    "the true situation is more complicated .    in their favour",
    ", the exponential cutoff in pulsars has been measured exquisitely well @xcite .",
    "the observed peak for the excess gev emission at 14 gev is consistent with the observed cutoff energy for _ fermi _ pulsars that tend to cluster around 0.4 gev @xmath4 6 gev . the average _ fermi _ gamma - ray luminosity for msps from six months of _ fermi _ data also appears to be in the right ballpark of the excess @xcite . unlike dark matter , the existence of a galactic centre population of neutron stars has also been firmly established based on discovery of a handful of pulsars within @xmath5 of sgr a@xmath6 @xcite .    thus , although there are some differences at the astrophysical level , observationally it is still very difficult to tell pulsars and dark matter apart for models with dark matter particle mass @xmath1 between 0.1 and 100 gev .",
    "here we suggest that a population of hard ( @xmath0 ) msps could still account for the gev excess at the galactic centre .",
    "initially , we estimate the pulsar population needed within a few degrees of the galactic centre in the context of the newly released second _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "next , we motivate and discuss potential reasons for a concentration of hard msps in the innermost region .",
    "we close with implications and possible ways forward .",
    "our first task is to revise the measured pulsar luminosities and certify that it is possible to reproduce the excess gev emission at the galactic centre with the most recent list of _ fermi _ msps . using three years of data , the second _ fermi _ lat pulsar catalogue ( 2fpc ) reports a total of 117 gamma - ray pulsars of which 77 are young or middle - aged and 40 are msps @xcite .",
    "the updated catalogue nearly triples the previous _ fermi _ pulsar list and it appears to be progressively populated by more msps with harder photon index @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ figure1 ] , where we plot the photon spectral index against the energy flux from 0.1 to 100 gev for _ fermi _ msps .",
    "as in @xcite , we adopt a 0.1  100 gev energy flux of @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 for the gev excess from the galactic centre . at the distance of the galactic centre ( 8.3 kpc )",
    ", this corresponds to a gamma - ray luminosity @xmath10 erg s@xmath9 @xmath11 , where @xmath11 represents the correction factor .",
    "following @xcite , we can estimate the total number of msps potentially present in the galactic centre from the gamma - ray luminosity @xmath12 and the average luminosity of a typical pulsar @xmath13 using ,    @xmath14    in order to solve this relation , we must first understand the current lat sensitivity to pulsars . starting with the predicted sensitivity limits for a pulsar - like spectrum with @xmath15 and @xmath16 gev reported by @xcite",
    ", we have built a sensitivity curve for the entire range of power law indices assuming a pulsar - like exponential cutoff energy spectrum , with a fixed parameter @xmath16 gev @xmath17    figure [ figure1 ] shows the lat sensitivity from 0.1 to 100 gev for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , there is a strong latitude dependence of the sensitivity .",
    "in addition , the sensitivity degrades by a factor of @xmath20 for harder pulsar spectra .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the diffuse flux in the innermost region .",
    "only 5 out of 40 msps are located at @xmath21 , including 3 of the most luminous msps in the entire sample . in short ,",
    "we have not fully resolved the msp population in the galactic centre region .    assuming a flux threshold of @xmath22 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 for a photon index @xmath3 implies that @xmath23 are needed to reproduce the excess gev emission from the galactic centre . for a more conservative estimate",
    ", we can take psr  j16003053 as a typical representative of the hard - spectrum pulsar population at the galactic centre . with a luminosity @xmath13 = @xmath24 erg s@xmath9 and a photon index @xmath25",
    ", psr  j1600 - 3053 has the hardest pulsar spectrum of the msps in the 2fpc @xcite .",
    "a population of comparable luminosity would raise the requirement to @xmath26 .",
    "both estimates are still in agreement with the population of predicted msps ( @xmath27 ) at the galactic centre derived from observations at other wavelengths @xcite .     for msps .",
    "the solid line denotes the effective sensitivity curve for pulsar spectra with an exponential cutoff energy of @xmath16 gev at @xmath18 .",
    "the dotted curve is for high - latitude pulsars at @xmath19.,width=336 ]    this does not necessarily imply that all msps in the galactic centre region will be gamma - ray emitters . of the 169 known field radio msps , about 40 have been detected by _",
    "therefore at least 20% of msps should be detectable in gamma rays .",
    "but at this point , it seems that we have only scratched the tip of iceberg in terms of msp detections and could be missing the bulk of these systems @xcite .",
    "in terms of luminosity , msps appear to be viable explanation for the inner gamma - ray excess .",
    "however , we need to further motivate the presence of a population of hard - spectrum msps at the galactic centre . from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "spectral variations are expected in the photon index depending on the viewing geometry and the contribution from different emission regions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , annihilating dark matter should be spectrally invariant across the sky .",
    "our analysis thus far admits two possible msp scenarios .",
    "the first is that _ fermi _ is detecting an msp population that is truly unique to the galactic centre .",
    "based on egret observations , @xcite argued that most msp pulsars near the galactic centre are formed from old , slow moving neutron stars that have been recycled to msps .",
    "because of its high stellar density ( @xmath28@xmath29 stars pc@xmath30 ) , only dense globular clusters ( @xmath31 stars pc@xmath30 ) with a long dynamical history can come close to mimicking the galactic centre neighbourhood .",
    "steady gamma - ray emission has been significantly detected towards a growing population globular clusters @xcite .",
    "these tend to show hard spectral indices ( @xmath32 ) and exponential cutoffs in the range 1.02.6 gev , which go in the right direction to explain the excess gev emission .    given the similarities in stellar densities , we want to test whether the galactic centre is consistent with the properties of gamma - ray - emitting globular clusters .",
    "one of the observational properties of globular clusters that might provide context is the apparent trend for higher gamma - ray luminosity with increasing [ fe / h ] for globular clusters @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] marks the location where the galactic centre falls with respect to the fundamental plane of globular clusters derived by @xcite . from the figure",
    ", we see that the galactic centre appears to be incompatible with the fundamental - plane relationship .",
    "apart from the particular stellar dynamics around the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre , the difference may be due to a near solar metallicity of the galactic centre [ fe / h ] = 0.12 @xcite and the presence of compact young clusters in the central 50 pc that can reach central densities as high as @xmath29 stars pc@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this could be the first tentative indication that we are dealing with an endemic msp population .",
    "as yet , the formation channels for msps remain a puzzle .",
    "it is generally agreed that close , interacting x - ray binaries eventually end up as msps @xcite . using population synthesis models , @xcite argued that roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) systems involving the collapse of massive onemg white dwarfs should be pervasive in the galactic centre .",
    "metal - rich stars fill their roche lobe more easily @xcite , and as a result the formation rate of msps could be enhanced compared to globular clusters .",
    "this would explain the deviation of the galactic centre from the fundamental plane of globular clusters .    as for the hard spectrum measured by @xcite",
    ", we note that the median photon index of the x - ray sources discovered by _",
    "chandra _ within the inner @xmath33 of the galaxy is @xmath34 @xcite . in the 2fpc",
    ", one sees a growing trend @xmath35 for harder spectrum at lower msp spindown luminosity @xcite .",
    "the spindown luminosity can be written    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the dipole moment , @xmath38 is the rotation frequency , and @xmath39 is the magnetic inclination angle @xcite .",
    "one simple prescription is that the msp formation process near the galactic centre favours smaller magnetic inclination angles @xmath40 .",
    "as argued by @xcite , this might be a natural tendency for recycled gamma - ray pulsars in general , but could be more frequent in the galactic centre . if recycled pulsars with onemg companions are prevalent in the galactic centre region @xcite , they will be much slower rotators ( lower @xmath41 ) than msps with he wd companions @xcite .    .",
    "the straight line shows the fundamental plane relationship from @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines represent 95% confidence bands .",
    "the star shows the galactic centre , consistent with the tendency for metal - rich environments and higher gamma - ray luminosity but clearly an outlier from the reported relationship.,width=336 ]    since there appears to be an emerging population of hard spectra outside the galactic plane , the alternative scenario is that hard msps are not necessarily tied to the galactic centre , but have formed throughout the galaxy .",
    "if true , the incipient hard ( @xmath0 ) sample might reveal some clues about their origin .",
    "looking at the seven hard _ fermi _ pulsars individually , there is a smorgasbord of pulsar oddities .",
    "six of these seven msps are in binary systems .",
    "psr j16142230 hosts the most massive pulsar known to date @xcite .",
    "psr j20510827 has one of the shortest orbital periods @xmath42 hr @xcite , while psr j2302 + 4442 has one of the longest @xmath43 days @xcite .",
    "psr j16003053 is among the best high - precision pulsars known @xcite .",
    "psr j21243358 is the lone isolated msp @xcite .",
    "psr j01016422 is the only object where simple geometric emission models fail to explain the observed peaks , suggesting that the details of its msp magnetosphere are more complex than expected @xcite . because of frequent encounters and companion exchanges , the galactic centre could be more conducive to the production of pulsar oddities .",
    "when compared with other field msps , no single connecting thread stands out in this bunch .",
    "however , we can not rule out that these systems were formed in rare special environments .",
    "dedicated studies of possible msp birth locations and companions could reveal additional information .",
    "in view of our results , it is still possible to explain the gamma - ray excess in the galactic centre with a population of hard - spectra msps .",
    "an essential test of these ideas is to search for similar excesses in other sections of the galaxy . interestingly , a possible excess coincident with the _ fermi _ bubbles",
    "has been reported @xcite .",
    "also @xcite indicated that current diffuse gamma - ray models under predict the data in the galactic plane .",
    "it is possible that some of the msps discussed here might have migrated to regions adjacent to the galactic centre .",
    "even if msps are not the culprits of the excess , inverse compton scattering of diffuse x - ray emission near the galactic centre @xcite by relativistic electrons ( lorentz factors @xmath44 5001000 ) could leave an imprint at gev energies . a deep galactic centre survey with the ability to resolve hard sources planned for",
    "the cherenkov telescope array should help clarify this issue @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that modelling the unresolved pulsar distribution will be critical step to assess astrophysical signatures of dark matter . beyond the galactic centre , pulsars above the galactic plane",
    "could potentially mimic galactic dark matter subhalos @xcite .",
    "nearby pulsars might also provide a source for the observed rising positron fraction @xcite . as a result , rather than treating excess gev emission as evidence for dark matter , it now seems obligatory to start including undetected pulsars as one of the largest contributors to this complex signal @xcite .",
    "this has been done rather successfully with the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "an excellent first attempt to account for pulsars was advanced by @xcite .",
    "since it is not obvious how to include a population that might be generally undetectable to _ fermi _ surveys , we must be extremely meticulous in building a composite pulsar template @xcite .",
    "perhaps it will be found that pulsars and dark matter contribute to the gev excess . with improved techniques",
    ", we could start disentangling the dark signal .    from the data reported so far , it is tempting to conclude that we are starting to see the first signals of annihilating dark matter .",
    "but we must take this road with caution in view of the degeneracy with pulsars .",
    "technically , a population of msps with steep spectrum would be very difficult to probe in radio @xcite .",
    "the dearth of photons near the lat sensitivity would also make it very difficult to conduct gamma - ray blind period searches with _ fermi _ @xcite .",
    "none the less , a dedicated search for gamma - ray pulsations from the inner galaxy is a must @xcite .",
    "a radio survey for additional pulsars with the next generation of sensitive receivers also appears to be a necessity .    at the end of the day ,",
    "the strongest astrophysical case for dark matter annihilation will be able to convene multiple sources with the same spectral signature across the sky .",
    "a tie - break would be the localisation of `` crab - like '' power - law tails in _ fermi _ pulsars at energies above 20 gev with the upcoming cherenkov telescope array @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is the direct detection of a spatially extended dark matter source @xcite .",
    "a line - like gamma - ray feature would be a game point @xcite .",
    "confirmation in at least two pillars of dark matter detection clinches the game @xcite .",
    "however , indirect dark matter detection may prove much more subtle . observing the galactic centre more frequently as part of a renewed _ fermi _",
    "observing strategy could start to break the stalemate @xcite .",
