    "the problem of how the static structure and dynamics of water are altered by a solute is at the heart of many problems related to solution chemistry and biology.@xcite the scope of interest here is not limited by the need to understand the overall thermodynamics of hydration .",
    "the alteration of the structure and dynamics of hydration shells surrounding a solute affects both the solute - solute interaction , such as protein - protein and protein - dna interactions,@xcite and the kinetics of chemical reactions , such as enzymatic catalysis.@xcite    two structural and dynamical characteristics of the interfacial water are at the center of the current focus .",
    "the first avenue is to understand the change in the structure of water in the hydration layer compared to the bulk@xcite and , related to that , the depth of this alteration propagating from the solute s surface into the bulk.@xcite the second avenue is the change in the dynamics of water in the hydration layer@xcite and the relative effect of the interface on the single - particle vs.  collective dynamics.@xcite the active discussion of these issues is also fueled by the disparity of answers to these questions provided by different experimental techniques on the one hand@xcite and an apparent lack of a universal picture supplied by formal theory and computer simulations on the other.@xcite    even the seemingly `` simple '' question of the structure of solute s hydration layers escapes a definitive answer .",
    "if any conclusion can be drawn from many years of active research , it is the realization that water can provide many competing structural motives , which can realize with different probability depending on a particular type of the water - solute interaction.@xcite the interaction with a non - polar solute , which seems to be the simplest problem , has generated an enormous literature devoted to hydrophobicity.@xcite while many details are still under scrutiny , the general emerging picture is that of two characteristic regimes of hydrophobic hydration , depending on the solute size in the first place.@xcite hydrophobic solvation of small solutes does not involve breaking of the water s network of hydrogen bonds , while solutes with their size exceeding @xmath1 nm disrupt water s structure , thus resulting in the dominance of surface effects in the hydration thermodynamics.@xcite despite this universal trend , the local density of the interfacial water is highly sensitive to the strength of the solute - water attraction , changing from weak de - wetting to a more typical density enhancement when the attraction increases.@xcite    the density alteration is not the only effect of the solute on the surrounding water .",
    "the orientational structure is also affected .",
    "again , starting with a `` simple '' solute - water configuration , orientational structure spontaneously appears in the interface of water with a non - polar solute or air.@xcite it is driven by the necessity to minimize the free energies of both the dipole and quadrupole moments of water,@xcite which are both significant and carry different symmetries ( water s quadrupole is mostly non - axial@xcite ) .",
    "this orientational structure , and , in particular , the interfacial quadrupolar density , is responsible for a surface potential of water@xcite and the related , but still not entirely understood , asymmetric distribution of positive and negative electrolyte ions in the interfacial region.@xcite    the structure of water interfacing air or non - polar solutes is still a poor representation of the interface with polar / charged solutes.@xcite in addition to typically denser,@xcite or even collapsed,@xcite water at hydrophilic surfaces , the orientational structure of water changes dramatically near polar / charged groups compared to non - polar / hydrophobic regions .",
    "different scenarios are possible , but the main qualitative feature is the creation of domains of preferentially oriented waters , consistent with the local electric field produced by the surface groups.@xcite once the network of hydrogen bonds of bulk water has been disrupted by a sufficiently large solute,@xcite reorientations of water s multipoles become more feasible and clustering of dipoles , dictated by local fields , takes place.@xcite given these dramatic structural changes of interfacial water compared to the bulk , it is almost trivial to say that interfacial dynamics should be different from bulk dynamics . addressing this question on a more quantitative basis",
    "has turned out to be more challenging.@xcite    the main current challenge in understanding the dynamics of hydration shells is to map the properties observed by experiment and produced by computer simulations on particular nuclear modes of hydration waters .",
    "since most observables are weighted averages of different nuclear modes , with different extent of collective behavior,@xcite the disparity between interpretations of different experiments is hardly surprising.@xcite most observations report slowing of the dynamics of first - shell hydration waters compared to the bulk,@xcite but the disagreement still exists on the values of retardation factors and on the spatial extent of slower hydration layers.@xcite among the techniques actively used to probe the dynamics of hydration shells are nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) ( mostly single - molecule rotational dynamics),@xcite stokes - shift dynamics ( collective electrostatic response),@xcite dielectric spectroscopy ( relaxation of the total dipole),@xcite and depolarized light scattering ( dls)@xcite and time - resolved optical kerr effect ( oke)@xcite ( relaxation of optical anisotropy ) .",
    "our focus here is predominantly on the dls response of solutions .",
    "the application of the extended dls ( edls ) technique to a number of aqueous solutions from carbohydrates,@xcite to peptides,@xcite to proteins@xcite have produced the picture of increasing retardation of the hydration water with increasing solute size and its hydrophilic character.@xcite recent molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of edls spectra have stressed on the collective nature of the optical anisotropy response,@xcite potentially linked to density fluctuations of interfacial waters .",
    "the purpose of this study is to further clarify the physical origin of the observed edls spectra and to contrast them with the response of the dipole moment of the solute and its hydration shell .    for bulk water , oke and dls techniques",
    "are essentially complimentary to dielectric spectroscopy.@xcite because of small polarizability anisotropy of water , dls and oke mostly probe dipole - induced - dipole ( did ) polarizability@xcite related to translational nuclear dynamics.@xcite in contrast , dielectric spectroscopy of bulk water , probing dipole relaxation , is closely linked to rotational diffusion.@xcite these two nuclear modes are separately probed by these two techniques in bulk water .",
    "whether this convenient separation extends to solutions is not entirely clear.@xcite our goal here is to contrast these two types of response by using md simulations and to clarify the physical mechanisms behind the polarizability anisotropy relaxation detected by the edls technique .",
    "the common explanation of the optical kerr effect assumes a molecule with the 2-rank tensor of its electronic ( high - frequency ) polarizability @xmath2 placed in the external field of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "anisotropy of @xmath2 yields an induced dipole perpendicular the external field , which emits perpendicular polarized scattered light .",
    "rotations of the molecule cause time - dependence of the emitted radiation and , consequently , time dependent oke signal .",
    "oke spectroscopy thus gives access to time - resolved molecular rotational dynamics , while depolarized light scattering provides the same information in the frequency domain.@xcite    the mechanism gives zero oke or dls response in the case of isotropically polarizable molecules with values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 in the molecular frame of principal axes diagonalizing @xmath2 .",
    "however , the dls signal is nonzero for condensed media of isotropically polarized particles.@xcite in that case , the dipole induced at particle @xmath5 by the external radiation in turn induces the dipole at particle @xmath6 through the 2-rank tensor of the dipole - dipole interaction @xmath7(did mechanism ) . within this picture ,",
    "both oke and dls spectroscopies report on collective dynamics of highly correlated induced dipoles , and not just on rotational diffusion of individual molecules,@xcite although rotations and translations are generally coupled in the did mechanism.@xcite    it is clear that the did mechanism should dominate for molecular liquids with weak polarizability anisotropy.@xcite this is indeed the case for water characterized by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xmath11 for its principal - axes polarizability when the water molecule is in the @xmath12-plane.@xcite the results of our calculations of the loss dls spectrum for pure spc / e water are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and described in more detail below .    the solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] refers to the anisotropic polarizability of water , while the solid red line is obtained assuming isotropic polarizability @xmath13 $ ] assigned to all principal polarizability components .",
    "as is seen , the dls signals are nearly identical for isotropically and anisotropically polarizable water .",
    "the induced did component of the response , marked `` i - i '' in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , dominates the dls spectrum .",
    "the relevant question here is the dynamics of which nuclear modes are displayed by the dls response . given that dipole - dipole interactions are sensitive to intermolecular distance , a reasonable conjecture is that either single - particle translational dynamics or the dynamics of collective density fluctuations are measured in the first place .",
    "the dls response of isotropically polarizable liquids can in fact be described in terms of the dynamic density structure factors ( collective density fluctuations),@xcite while a small fraction of the oke response can still be assigned to rotational diffusion.@xcite the dominance of translational modes and of the did mechanism in the dls response are preserved for the water component of the mixture as well.@xcite    , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xmath11 ; the water molecule is in the @xmath12-plane with the @xmath14-axis set as the axis of rotational symmetry .",
    ", width=340 ]    the situation becomes significantly more complex for solutions .",
    "solutes often carry anisotropic polarizability , and their dls response can naturally be assigned to their rotational diffusion.@xcite however , in addition to the typically slowest dls band assigned to solute s rotations , bands intermediate in frequency between the solute and water have been detected in the solution spectra and assigned to hydration water shells,@xcite with the intensity of the intermediate dls peak associated with the number of hydrated hydroxide groups.@xcite    the solute we study here , n - acetyl - leucine - methylamide ( nalma ) , is considered to be hydrophobic , with no specific interactions with waters .",
    "it presents therefore an opportunity of a simpler system , compared to sugars , for which relative contributions from different relaxation processes to the dls signals can be disentangled by md simulations .",
    "aqueous solution of nalma have been studied by a number of experimental techniques including neutron scattering,@xcite terahertz absorption,@xcite nmr,@xcite oke,@xcite and edls@xcite spectroscopies .",
    "classical md simulations of aqueous nalma solutions have also been reported.@xcite    a fairly simple decomposition of the dls signal indeed emerges from our simulations .",
    "we do not detect the 50 - 60 ghz component observed for hydrated sugars,@xcite but find two slower modes which can be assigned to single - molecule nalma rotations and collective did relaxation of nalmas in solution .",
    "no slowing down of the hydration layers is seen either in the dls response of solutions or in the dipolar relaxation of hydration shells .",
    "the hydration shell nevertheless displays a significant orientational structure propagating @xmath15 hydration layers into the bulk .",
    "the dipolar polarizability of the solution @xmath16 is given as a sum of the molecular polarizability @xmath17 and the polarizability @xmath18 caused by interactions between induced molecular dipoles@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 adds @xmath21 polarizabilities of the solutes and @xmath22 polarizabilities of the solvent molecules .",
    "the induction component in eq .",
    "is not pair - wise decomposable since it arises from all chains of dipole - dipole interactions between the induced electronic dipoles.@xcite full classical description of this term requires self - consistent calculations of all induced dipoles in the sample .",
    "a perturbation simplification of this expensive algorithm , which was shown to be accurate in application to typical dense polarizable liquids,@xcite involves only the sum over pairwise dipole - dipole coupling terms .",
    "one gets , for instance , for the solvent component @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dipolar tensor .",
    "the polarizability of water is the sum of molecular and induced polarizabilities , @xmath25 .",
    "dipolar polarizabilities @xmath26 are assigned to oxygen atoms in the case of water .",
    "this simplified scheme can not be used for extended solutes , and a formalism accounting for a distributed polarizability is required .",
    "we have used here , following ladanyi and co - workers,@xcite the thole formalism that assigns an induced point dipole to each atom in a multi - atom molecule.@xcite since mutual dipolar interactions between induced atomic dipoles need to be accounted for , the effective atomic polarizabilities of the solute atoms are obtained by inverting the matrix containing self polarizabilties and their dipole - dipole couplings at each configuration of the solute molecule along the simulation trajectory . the procedure is explained in more detail in the supplementary material ( sm),@xcite but its outcome is a @xmath27 matrix obtained by inverting the combination of @xmath28 site atomic polarizabilities with dipole - dipole interactions between them .",
    "this matrix then defines the atomic dipolar polarizability @xmath29 at each site @xmath30 of solute @xmath31 , where @xmath32 runs over @xmath33 atoms of the solute ( @xmath34 for nalma ) .    since the dipole - dipole coupling between the induced dipoles at the atomic sites of the solute",
    "are taken into account to all orders by the matrix inversion , there is no need in accounting for induced polarizability of the solute sites .",
    "induced polarizabilities , however , arise from dipole - dipole interactions between the oxygens of water and the atomic sites of the solutes .",
    "the solute - solvent induced polarizability therefore reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dipolar tensor connecting site @xmath30 of solute @xmath31 ( out of @xmath21 solutes overall ) to the oxygen atom of water @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , the induced polarizability from the solute - solute dipolar interactions reads as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dipolar tensor connecting site @xmath30 of solute @xmath31 with site @xmath40 of solute @xmath41 .",
    "reaction - field corrections for the finite size of the simulation box@xcite were included in all dipolar tensors used to calculate the dipolar interactions from the simulation trajectories ( see sm@xcite ) .",
    "the overall polarizability @xmath42 of the solutes is the sum of @xmath21 molecular polarizabilities calculated from the thole inversion,@xcite with their mutual induced polarizabilities @xmath43 where @xmath44 the total polarizability of the sample becomes @xmath45    the trajectory of the solution polarizability is used to calculate the time autocorrelation function based on its off - diagonal components @xmath46 where @xmath4 are the cartesian components of the 2-rank cartesian tensor .",
    "the time correlation function is used to define the oke response function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the inverse temperature .",

    "in conclusion , we find that dls response of pure water is mostly affected by its translational dynamics projected on anisotropy relaxation of the did polarizability . the main relaxation components of nalma solutions are bulk water and rotations of solutes with the second - order rotational diffusion time of @xmath56 ps and the corresponding first - order rotational diffusion time of @xmath57 ps . we have found no detectable dls response from the hydration layer distinct from the bulk .",
    "in addition , a relatively weak signal from solute rotations is a result of cross - correlations between these rotations and water translations ( density fluctuations ) suppressing the rotational peak .",
    "the slowest , and relatively weak , relaxation component in the dls response comes from collective did polarizability caused by solutes density fluctuations .",
    "this general outcome is in line with the recent emerging evidence suggesting that specific interactions are required to observe water dynamics substantially slower than bulk dynamics.@xcite the slowing down is therefore local.@xcite when solutes provide specific binding sites , water molecules bound to solutes demonstrate relaxation times specific to the solute motions.@xcite once sites for specific binding are not available , as is the case with nalma studied here and with somewhat similar on the hydrophobicity scale t - butyl alcohol studied elsewhere,@xcite there is little perturbation of the water dynamics caused by the solute . for instance , recent simulations of electrolyte solutions@xcite have shown no slowing down of water dynamics around chloride ions , but significantly slower dynamics around stronger solvating magnesium ions , all in the same electrolyte solution .    the conclusions reached in this study disagree with edls experiments , which indicate a slow , 3050 ghz , component of water dynamics both for sugar@xcite and nalma@xcite solutions .",
    "plausible sources of discrepancy between simulations and experiments may be envisaged in the force - field and in the perturbation approximation adopted for the solution polarizability .",
    "deprotonation equilibria , with slow water located around ionized sites , can not be excluded as well .    while no specific response of the hydration layer is seen from the density fluctuations of hydration waters",
    ", there is a substantial orientational structure of the hydration layer , which propagates @xmath15 water layers into the bulk .",
    "it is reflected in a slow saturation of electrostatic observables with increasing size of the hydration shell and in a similarly slow decay of dipole - dipole correlations ( partial kirkwood factor ) .",
    "the orientational perturbation of the hydration layers does not result in a significant dynamic signature .",
    "the changes of the dynamics of the shell dipole moment and of single - molecule rotations are fairly insignificant .",
    "this latter outcome , and the lack of a significant structural perturbation of the second hydration shell , are not necessarily universal results and might depend on both the size of the solute and the distribution of surface polarity.@xcite proteins , which are both larger in size and possess a higher density of the surface charge , clearly show slowing down of the hydration shell dynamics , both in the density and orientational manifolds.@xcite    there is a clear distinction between the perturbation produced by the solute to the interfacial structure and to the interfacial dynamics .",
    "potential energies affect structure , while forces determine the dynamics .",
    "interaction potentials , in particular electrostatic interactions , can be long - ranged and significant ( compared to @xmath58 ) , while forces produced by these interactions can be weak relative to local forces affecting local dynamics .",
    "short - ranged specific interactions , producing stronger forces , play a more essential role in affecting the dynamics , while long - ranged interactions are responsible for the structure of the interface .    from the technical side , our calculations stress on the necessity to correctly calculate the collective dynamic and statistical properties of a chosen sub - ensemble , hydration shells in this study .",
    "linear response of a sub - ensemble to an external perturbation necessarily includes cross - correlations with the same property determined for the entire region affected by the perturbation ( the entire simulation box for long - wavelength radiation ) .",
