    "<S> previously measured thermopower data of cenisn exhibit a significant sample dependence and non - monotonous behavior in magnetic fields . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the measured thermopower @xmath0 may contain a contribution from the huge nernst coefficient of the compound , even in moderate fields of 2  t. a correction for this effect allows to determine the intrinsic field dependence of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed thermopower behavior can be understood from zeeman splitting of a v - shaped pseudogap in magnetic fields .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction : * the orthorhombic system cenisn has been classified as a kondo semimetal , in which an anisotropic pseudogap opens in the density of states ( dos ) below approximately 10  k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various experimental probes confirm the presence of a finite quasiparticle dos at the fermi level , such as the metal - like resistivities of samples with high purity  @xcite and the linear - in-@xmath1 dependence of the thermal conductivity below 0.3  k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields of the order of 10  t along the easy magnetic @xmath2 axis suppress the gap formation significantly , while fields along @xmath3 and @xmath4 are less effective @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the thermopower @xmath5 of cenisn is highly anisotropic and exhibits a significant sample dependence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below 10  k , the absolute values of @xmath5 are enhanced , which has been attributed to the gap formation in this temperature range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , application of a magnetic field of 8  t along the easy @xmath2 axis has been found to induce a significant lowering of the thermopower along @xmath2 , @xmath6 , at low @xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experimental data for @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 are inconsistent . </S>",
    "<S> first measurements at 4.2  k and 1.3  k showed a lowering of @xmath8 in magnetic fields  @xcite , while investigations on samples of higher purity revealed an increasing @xmath8 upon increasing field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , for @xmath7 at 1.3 k either a monotonous decrease up to 10  t  @xcite or an increase in 4  t with a subsequent decrease in 8  t  @xcite was found .    for correlated semimetals as cenisn </S>",
    "<S> a large nernst coefficient has been predicted  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding transverse thermal voltage can become comparable in magnitude to the longitudinal one even in moderate magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , small deviations from the ideal contact geometry may give rise to a non - negligible nernst contribution to the measured thermopower , an effect which has not been considered previously  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected to be most relevant for @xmath7 , which exhibits significantly lower absolute values at low temperatures than @xmath6 and @xmath8 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the intrinsic behavior of @xmath10 for @xmath9 and @xmath4 determined from measurements in positive and negative fields up to 7  t. +   + * experiments : * the investigated samples originate from the single crystal # 5 , which was grown by the czochralski technique and subsequently purified by the solid - state electrotransport ( sse ) technique as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermopower and nernst coefficient have been measured with a steady - state method . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature gradient along the samples was determined using a chromel - aufe@xmath11 thermocouple . in order to correct for spurious contributions due to a non - ideal contact geometry </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were performed in @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> two configurations are presented : the heat current @xmath13 was applied along @xmath3 with @xmath9 ( sample  1 ) and @xmath14 ( sample  2 ) . +   + * results : *     and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> exemplary error bars indicate the uncertainty of the data at low @xmath1 and high @xmath15 . above 4  k </S>",
    "<S> it is typically less than 1  @xmath16v / k . </S>",
    "<S> the inset compares the zero - field data obtained on two samples of cenisn . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the in - field antisymmetric contribution of the measured thermopower @xmath17 in comparison to the nernst signal @xmath18 in 2  t. @xmath19 can be scaled to @xmath18 by a factor of 8 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - svst],scaledwidth=96.0% ]    the zero - field thermopower of cenisn measured along @xmath3 , @xmath10 , is shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - svst ] . </S>",
    "<S> the data sets obtained on two different samples agree relatively well in the whole investigated temperature range . above 10  k , the thermopower exhibits a similar @xmath1 dependence as reported for a high - purity single crystal without sse treatment  @xcite : @xmath10 is positive with maxima at 20  k and 100  k. the two maxima are attributed to kondo scattering from the ground - state doublet and thermally populated cef levels . a contribution from paramagnon drag </S>",
    "<S> was also suggested as a possible origin for the maximum at 20  k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> toward lower @xmath1 , @xmath20 changes sign at 8  k and goes through a large negative minimum of @xmath21 @xmath16v / k at around 3.5  k. this value represents the largest negative @xmath5 ever observed for a cenisn sample . </S>",
    "<S> below 1.7  k the thermopower assumes again positive values . </S>",
    "<S> a similar temperature dependence has been observed in samples grown by a czochralski technique without sse treatment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these samples exhibit a negative @xmath7 between 2.5 and 7  k , however , with significantly smaller absolute values of at most -6  @xmath16v / k . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , investigations on single crystals of similar quality as those presented here yielded a thermopower @xmath10 with opposite sign and a maximum value of 8  @xmath16v / k at 3.5  k  @xcite .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 ( a ) , and the thermopower value at @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( b ) , for different orientations of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are meant guides to the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line in the left plot is a linear fit to the data for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars given for @xmath23 represent the scattering of the data around @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - min_vsb],scaledwidth=96.0% ]    the effect of a magnetic field along @xmath2 on the low-@xmath1 thermopower @xmath7 is shown in the main plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - svst ] . with increasing @xmath15 the minimum at @xmath25  k </S>",
    "<S> shifts to lower @xmath1 and the absolute values at the minimum @xmath26 are enhanced for @xmath27  t. in 7  t a weak lowering of @xmath26 is observed , which , however , is of the order of the uncertainty in the data . </S>",
    "<S> application of a magnetic field along @xmath4 gives rise to a similar evolution of @xmath0 ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the configuration @xmath9 , the shift of the minimum is less pronounced and no lowering of @xmath26 is observed around 7  t , ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - min_vsb ] ) . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - min_vsb]a shows the field dependence of @xmath22 for @xmath9 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly reveals that the shift of the minimum is stronger for @xmath9 . a linear extrapolation of @xmath28 to zero temperature yields a critical field of 14  t. </S>",
    "<S> this value is comparable to the energy - gap quenching field along @xmath2 of 18  t determined from resistivity measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is supposed that the shift of the minimum is related to the closing of the gap in field . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - min_vsb]b shows the evolution of the thermopower value at the minimum , @xmath29 for @xmath9 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath26 first increases with increasing field , a saturation and subsequent reduction is observed at higher @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the effect of a field along @xmath2 is more pronounced than that of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it is suspected that @xmath26 for both orientations is further reduced in higher @xmath15 as the minimum shifts to lower  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * discussion : * the strong sample dependence of @xmath0 of cenisn reported in literature has been related to the differing purity of the investigated crystals  @xcite . however , two other effects have to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , in view of the sensitive direction dependence of @xmath0 it can not be excluded that tiny misorientations are responsible for at least part of the reported variations . </S>",
    "<S> the large negative @xmath7 observed around 3  k in the present investigation could be easily diminished by a small contribution from the huge positive @xmath6 and @xmath8 of up to 70  @xmath16v / k expected in the same temperature range  @xcite . in this context , the small discrepancy of about 20  % between @xmath32 of sample 1 and 2 might be attributed to this effect . secondly , the large nernst signal expected for cenisn can contribute to the thermopower voltage for a non - ideal contact geometry . in the present investigation , </S>",
    "<S> this effect was already appreciable in 2  t as demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - svst]b . below 8  k </S>",
    "<S> the measured thermopower curves @xmath33 for positive and negative fields differ significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the in - field antisymmetric contribution @xmath34 $ ] exhibits a temperature dependence similar to that of the nernst signal @xmath35 in 2  t and can be scaled to it by a factor of 8 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a misorientation of the contacts by only @xmath36 . for the presented data </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been corrected for by averaging between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has generally not been accounted for in previous investigations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the drastic and non - monotonous change in @xmath7 around 2  k reported for crystals of similar quality as those investigated here  @xcite might be to some extent influenced by the huge nernst signal in this @xmath1 range . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the current study represents the first investigation with the intrinsic temperature dependence of @xmath7 in fields up to 7  t.     for different @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) field dependence of the logarithmic derivative of the dos at @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - fig4x1],scaledwidth=96.0% ]    application of magnetic fields @xmath40 is found to induce a systematic shift of the thermopower minimum at 3.5  k to lower temperatures ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - min_vsb]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated critical field along @xmath2 of 14  t as well as the stronger effect for @xmath9 compared to @xmath41 confirms that the minimum is related to the gap formation in cenisn . in this context , the enhancement of @xmath42 in parallel with the closing of the gap in field ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - min_vsb]b ) is surprising . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , application of a magnetic field does not only suppress the gap but also influences the residual dos inside the gap . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect has been found from investigations of the specific - heat @xmath43 of cenisn @xcite , which revealed an enhancement of @xmath43 at low @xmath1 in applied magnetic fields @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation had been interpreted within a simple model assuming zeeman splitting of a modified v - shaped dos  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an illustration , how the same mechanism can give rise to an enhancement of @xmath44 at low @xmath15 is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - fig4x1 ] : application of a magnetic field induces a shift of the sub - bands for the spin - up and spin - down states to different energetic directions , as shown for an arbitrary field in fig .  [ cns - fig4x1]a . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the resulting total dos around the gap structure depends sensitively on the field magnitude ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - fig4x1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the fermi level is situated slightly off the symmetry line of the gap structure , the slope of the dos at @xmath45 becomes field dependent ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cns - fig4x1]c ) . within this simplified picture , the absolute values of the thermopower @xmath46  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite increase in small magnetic fields and decreases for higher @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is admitted , that the sketched behavior is much too simple to explain in detail the behavior of @xmath47 observed for cenisn . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the presented picture demonstrates that the increase in @xmath44 is not fundamentally contradictory to the suppression of the gap in magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> zeeman splitting appears a possible and simple mechanism to understand the observed behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that a realistic band structure and the allowance for thermal broadening enables a more sophisticated description of the data . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum in @xmath10 of cenisn at 3  k is attributed to the gap formation and the observed field dependence is related to the suppression of the gap in magnetic fields . </S>"
