    "strange ( quark ) star is composed of nearly equal number of up , down , and strange quarks , and a few electrons for keeping neutralization of matter .",
    "it has important implications for studying the phase diagram of strong interaction system whether this kind of quark stars exist .",
    "recently , xu ( 2002 ) suggests that a featureless thermal spectrum could be a probe for identifying strange stars , since no bound charged particle is in discrete quantum states on the quark surface without strong magnetic field .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that discrete landau levels appear for charged particles in strong fields .",
    "two absorption lines , at @xmath1 and @xmath2 kev , are detected from an isolate neutron star ( 1e 1207.4 - 5209 ) with _ chandra _ by sanwal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and are then confirmed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ by mereghetti et al .",
    "certainly 1e 1207.4 - 5209 can not be a bare strange star if those two lines are atomic - transition originated , although the stellar mass @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 may be derived by obtaining the gravitational redshift ( as @xmath5 ) and the pressure broadening ( as @xmath6 ) of the lines .",
    "however , if these double lines are caused by the landau - level transition of electrons , 1e 1207.4 - 5209 could also be a bare strange star since no atom might be on the stellar surface .",
    "sanwal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) addressed that the features are associated with atomic transition of once - ionized helium , and thought that it is hard to interpret the absorption features in term of cyclotron lines .",
    "however , we will find in the next section that the possibility of the absorption being cyclotron resonance can not be ruled out .",
    "we will present , in this _",
    "letter _ , a short note to confute the interpretation of the recently discovered lines in the x - ray spectrum of 1e1207 - 52 , that these spectral lines are testifying the presence of an atmosphere on the star which can absolutely not be a bare strange star .",
    "in sanwal et al . ( 2002 ) , the authors discussed two potential possibilities in generating the absorption features , i.e. , cyclotron or atomic transition lines , but considered the former scenario unlikely .",
    "they hence suggested that the features are associated with atomic transitions of once - ionized helium .",
    "here we hope to point out that all the criticisms about the cyclotron line mechanism by sanwal et al .",
    "can be circumvented , so that such a possibility is not ruled out .",
    "below we will answer their criticisms in turn .",
    "the inferred field value , @xmath7 g , based on @xmath8 and @xmath9 is significantly larger than the field @xmath10 g derived by assuming that the 0.7 kev and @xmath11 kev lines are the fundamental and the first harmonics , respectively ( sanwal et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that 1e 1207.4 - 5209 has a debris disk , which is currently conjectured for interpreting the enigmatic sources of anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft @xmath12ray repeaters in literatures ( e.g. , chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ) , since it is in the center of a supernova remnant . a recent discovery of a near - infrared counterpart to an axp ( 1e1048 ,",
    "wang & chakrabarty 2002 ) may be a hint of such kind a fallback accretion disk .",
    "israel et al.s discovery ( 2002 ) strengthens the infrared association with the axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 . in case of this disk ,",
    "1e 1207.4 - 5209 provides a potential possibility for us to investigate the disk property by dividing the total braking rate into magnetodipole and disk ones , since the total rotational energy loss ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 the moment of inertia ) is the sum of the dipole radiation power and the propeller energy loss @xmath15 ( francischelli & wijers 2002 ) , where @xmath3 is the mass of center star , @xmath16 the accretion rate , and the magnetosphere radius @xmath17 cm .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the accretion material driven by viscosity in the fossil disk ca nt fall onto the stellar surface because of centrifugal forces acting on the matter , but is ejected by the boundary reaction during the propeller phase .",
    "the magnetodipole spin down @xmath18 s@xmath19 for a pulsar with polar field @xmath20 , and then @xmath21 s@xmath19 .",
    "the fossil disk torque dominates , which could be the reason that this source is radio quiet ( otherwise , a source may be radio loud if the dipole radiation torque dominates ) .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate @xmath22 g / s @xmath23 per year .",
    "we find @xmath24 cm , the radius of light cylinder @xmath25 cm , and the corotating radius @xmath26 cm .",
    "these radii are consistent with the propeller requirement : @xmath27 . in addition , the age problem ( e.g. , mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 ) , that the characteristic age @xmath28 kyrs is much larger than the estimated age @xmath29 kyrs for the remnant pks 1209 - 51/52 , might also be solved in this scenario .",
    "the 0.7 kev line is not much stronger than the 1.4 kev one ( sanwal et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is true that the oscillator strength of the first harmonic is much smaller than that of the fundamental in the weak field limit , but this does not mean that the absorption - like dips would have significant differences .",
    "in fact , the spectrum profile should be calculated by modelling the resonant cyclotron radiation transfer .",
    "for instance , even for a field of @xmath30 g ( in this case , the ratio of the oscillator strength could be @xmath31 ) , those two spectrum lines calculated could be similar in depth ( freeman et al .",
    "1999 ) , depending on radiative geometry .",
    "observationally , the cyclotron absorption depth of the fundamental is _ not _ much stronger than that of the first harmonic ( e.g. , trmper et al .",
    "1978 , with @xmath32 g ) .",
    "in addition , the observation does show that the integrated photons absorbed by the fundamental transition are much more than those by the first harmonic transition .",
    "the charge density in the star s magnetosphere can not be large enough to scatter resonantly the photons from the surface ( sanwal et al .",
    "the main reason , which leads the authors to this conclusion , is that the required electron number density , @xmath33 @xmath34 , is two orders larger than the goldreich - julian density , @xmath35 @xmath34 .",
    "however , although pulsar magnetospheres are not known with certain , it is a common point that primary pairs with lorentz factor @xmath36 and with density @xmath37 are accelerated in gaps while more secondary pairs with lorentz factor @xmath38 are created outside the gaps ( e.g. , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) . in despite of that the net charge density could be @xmath39 , the absolute number density should be @xmath40 times of @xmath39 , which should be enough to effectively scatter the photons from the stellar surface .",
    "actually , this could be another possibility for cyclotron absorptions in the magnetosphere even if no fossil disk contributes a braking torque .",
    "the atomic transition of once - ionized helium may be responsible to these lines , although the authors had not presented a full discussion in this possibility .",
    "however , in this interpretation , they assume a general field with superstrong strength , @xmath41 g , which is much larger than the derived field @xmath7 g. it is hard to understand that this `` neutron '' star with a _ typical",
    "_ field @xmath42 can have such a strong prevalent multipole field on the surface .",
    "certainly sanwal et al s discovery is very important in both possibility : the mass and radius may be derived if the absorption are atomic transition originated , or the accretion rate in the propeller phase could be estimated , for the first time , in case of two cyclotron lines ( point 1 ) .",
    "mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the absorption features are phase - dependent : the @xmath2 kev line prefers to appear during the minimum and the rising the parts , rather than at the peak , of the pulse profile .",
    "this observational property may reflect the geometry of resonant cyclotron emission : there is almost only one fundamental line for an observer along the magnetic fields , while more harmonic lines appear if the line - of - sight is perpendicular to the fields ( fig.3 of freeman et al .",
    "an effort to fit the observed spectrum of 1e 1207.4 - 5209 was tried by hailey & mori ( 2002 ) who presumed that the star has an atmosphere with he - like oxygen or neon in not too high a field ; whereas an elaborate model calculation ( being prepared ) , to fit in term of cyclotron resonance lines , is also necessary in order to know the details of the source .",
    "a very interesting and important question is : why is 1e 1207.4 - 5209 the only one in which significant absorption features have been detected so far ? to answer this question , mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested 1e 1207.4 - 5209 has a metal atmosphere , which is not old enough to accrete a hydrogen layer .",
    "however , this question may naturally be answered by the selective effect in observations , since maybe only a few sources have magnetic fields being suitable for creating cyclotron lines with energies in the detector energy range .",
    "the fundamental electron cyclotron resonance lies at @xmath43 kev , where @xmath44 is the polar magnetic field in @xmath45 g , @xmath46 is the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the stellar mass and radius , respectively . for a bare strange star with certain mass @xmath3 , one can obtain its radius @xmath4 by integrating numerically the tov equation , with the inclusion of the equation of state for strange matter : @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the bag constant ) .",
    "the fundamental resonance energy as a function of magnetic field for strange stars with different masses is shown in fig.1 .",
    "we can see that , for detectors ( _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ ) from @xmath49 to @xmath50 kev , the sensitivity fields in which electrons can absorb resonantly photons within that energy range are from @xmath51 g to @xmath52 g .",
    "it is well known that pulsars tend to have a magnetic field of @xmath53 g ( normal pulsars ) or of @xmath54 g ( millisecond pulsars ) ; it is thus not a surprise that only few sources are observed to show spectral lines .",
    "_ no source _ listed in the table of xu ( 2002 ) has definitely a suitable field .",
    "recently , a 5 kev absorption feature has been detected and confirmed in the bursts of a soft - gamma - repeater sgr 1806 - 20 ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ) , which is believed to be the feature as one of the proton cyclotron lines in superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath55 g ) by the authors .",
    "however there are some difficulties in this explanation . 1 , due to the high mass - energy ( @xmath56 gev ) of a proton , the ratio of the oscillator strength of the first harmonic to that of fundamental in @xmath57 g is _ only",
    "_ @xmath58 ! it is not reasonable to detect the first and the _ even _ higher harmonics .",
    "in fact , numerical spectrum simulations of atmospheres with protons in superstrong fields have never show more than two proton absorption lines ( ho & lai 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "2 , a better and more reasonable model for the continuum spectrum component is needed in order to identify such absorption features in reality .",
    "motivated by these flaws , we suggest that the possible absorption lines at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 kev could be interpreted as electron cyclotron lines , while the @xmath62 kev absorption might be caused by other effects ( e.g. , can the accreting plasma with irons absorb at @xmath62 kev ? ) .",
    "the much small ratio , @xmath63 , of oscillation strength can also not large enough to produce a second harmonic of @xmath64 particle at @xmath62 kev .",
    "sgr 1806 - 20 may have an ordinary magnetic field , @xmath65 g , which should be another pulsar - like compact stars with suitable magnetic fields for the detectors in the sky .",
    "strange stars could exist ; the exotic surface of a bare strange star might eventually result in the identification of them , especially the most probable one rx j1856 ( e.g. , drake et al .",
    "2002 , xu 2002 ) .",
    "although each of the observed phenomena from pulsar - like stars may be interpreted under the regime of traditional neutron star with unusual or artificial physical properties , it might be a natural way to understand the observations by updating `` neutron '' stars with ( bare ) strange stars ."
