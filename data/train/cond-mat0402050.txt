    "the idea of centrality was first applied to human communication by bavelas @xcite who was interested in the characterization of the communication in small groups of people and assumed a relation between structural centrality and influence in group processes . since then",
    "various measures of structural centrality have been proposed over the years to quantify the importance of an individual in a social network @xcite .",
    "most of the centrality measures are based on one of two quite different conceptual ideas and can be divided into two large classes .",
    "+ the measures in the first class are based on the idea that the centrality of an individual in a network is related to how he is _ near _ to the other persons .",
    "the simplest and most straightforward way to quantify the individual centrality is therefore the degree of the individual , i.e. the number of its first neighbours .",
    "the most systematic elaboration of this concept is to be found in @xcite . a degree - based measure of the individual centrality corresponds to the notion of how well connected the individual is within its _ local _ environment .",
    "the degree - based measure of centrality can be extended beyond first neighbours by considering the number of points that an individual can reach at distance two or three @xcite .",
    "global _ measure based on the concept of closeness was proposed in @xcite in terms of the distances among the various points .",
    "one of the simplest notion of closeness is that calculated from the sum of the geodesic distances from an individual to all the other points in the graph @xcite .",
    "+ the second class of measures is based on the idea that central individuals stand _ between _ others on the path of communication @xcite .",
    "the betweenness of a point measures to what extent the point can play the role of intermediary in the interaction between the others .",
    "the simplest and most used measure of betweenness was proposed by freeman @xcite and is based on geodesic paths . in many real situations , however , communication does not travel through geodesic paths only .",
    "for such a reason two other measures of betweenness , the first based on all possible paths between a couple of points @xcite , and the second based on random paths , @xcite have been introduced more recently .",
    "+ in this paper we propose a new measure of point centrality which is a combination of the two main ideas of centrality mentioned above .",
    "the new measure in fact is sensitive to how much an individual is close to the others and also to how much he stands between the others .",
    "the measure is named _ information centrality _ since is based on the concept of efficient propagation of information over the network @xcite .",
    "the information centrality of an individual is defined as the relative drop in the network efficiency caused by the removal of the individual from the network . in other words",
    "we measure how the communication over the network is affected by the deactivation of the individual .",
    "the information centrality is defined for both valued and non - valued graph , and naturally applies to group and classes as well as individuals . + the paper is organized as follows . in section [ standard ]",
    "we briefly review the most widely used measures of centrality , degree closeness and betweenness . in section",
    "[ new ] we introduce point and group information centrality , while in section [ centralization ] we discuss how the information centrality can be used to measure the centralization of the graph .",
    "similarities and dissimilarities with respect to the standard measures are discussed and illustrated by means of simple examples in section [ comparing ] and section [ primate ] .",
    "we first review the three most commonly adopted measures of point centrality @xcite : the degree centrality @xmath1 , the closeness centrality @xmath2 , and the betweenness centrality @xmath3 .",
    "such measures of centrality imply three competing theories of how centrality might affect group processes , respectively centrality as activity , centrality as independence and centrality as control @xcite .",
    "we represent a social network as a _ non - directed _ , _ non - valued _",
    "graph @xmath4 , consisting of a set of @xmath5 points ( vertices or nodes ) and a set of @xmath6 edges ( or lines ) connecting pairs of points .",
    "the points of the graph are the individuals , the actors of a social group and the lines represent the social links .",
    "the graph can be described by the so - called adjacency matrix , a @xmath7 matrix whose entry @xmath8 is @xmath9 if there is an edge between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "the entries on the diagonal , values of @xmath13 , are undefined , and for convenience are set to be equal to 0 .",
    "* degree centrality * the simplest definition of point centrality is based on the idea that important points must be the most active , in the sense that they have the largest number of ties to other points in the graph .",
    "thus a centrality measure for an actor @xmath10 , is the degree of @xmath10 , i.e. the number of points adjacent to @xmath10 .",
    "two points are said adjacent if they are linked by an edge .",
    "the degree centrality of @xmath10 can be defined as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the degree of point @xmath10 . since a given point @xmath10 can at most be adjacent to @xmath16 other points",
    ", @xmath16 is the normalization factor introduced to make the definition independent of the size of the network and to have @xmath17 .",
    "the degree centrality focuses on the most visible actors in the network .",
    "an actor with a large degree is in direct contact to many other actors and being very visible is immediately recognized by others as a hub , a very active point and major channel of communication .",
    "* closeness centrality * the degree centrality is a measure of local centrality .",
    "a definition of actor centrality on a global scale is based on how close an actor is to all the other actors . in this case",
    "the idea is that an actor is central if it can quickly interact with all the others , not only with first neighbours .",
    "the simplest notion of closeness is based on the concept of minimum distance or geodesic @xmath18 , i.e. the minimum number of edges traversed to get from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the closeness centrality of point @xmath10 is @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average distance from actor @xmath10 to all the other actors and the normalization makes @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath2 is to be used when measures based upon independence are desired @xcite .",
    "such a measure is meaningful for connected graphs only , unless one assumes @xmath18 equal to a finite value , for instance the maximum possible distance @xmath16 , instead of @xmath22 , when there is no path between two nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "such an assumption will be used in section [ primate ] to study a non - connected graph .",
    "* betweenness centrality * interactions between two non - adjacent points might depend on the other actors , especially on those on the paths between the two .",
    "therefore points in the middle can have a strategic control and influence on the others .",
    "the important idea at the base of this centrality measure is that an actor is central if it lies between many of the actors .",
    "this concept can be simply quantified by assuming that the communication travels just along the geodesic .",
    "if @xmath23 is the number of geodesics linking the two actors @xmath11 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the number of geodesics linking the two actors @xmath11 and @xmath24 that contain point @xmath10 , the betweenness centrality of actor @xmath10 can be defined as @xcite : @xmath26 in the double summation at the numerator , @xmath11 and @xmath24 must be different from @xmath10 .",
    "similarly to the other centrality measures @xmath27 takes on values between 0 and 1 , and it reaches its maximum when actor @xmath10 falls on all geodesics . + there are several extensions to the original betweenness measure proposed by freeman .",
    "in particular , in most of the cases the communication does not travel through geodesic paths only , and for this reason a more realistic betweenness measure should include non - geodesic as well as geodesic paths .",
    "here we mention two other measures of betweenness that include contributions from non - geodesic paths : the flow betweenness and the random paths betweenness .",
    "we will disuss in detail the first one since it will be used in some of the examples of the following sections .",
    "the flow betweenness was introduced in @xcite and is based on the concept of maximum flow .",
    "it is defined by assuming that each edge of the graph is like a pipe and can carry a unitary amount of flow ( or an amount of flow equal to the edge s value in the extension to valued graphs ) . by considering a generic point @xmath11 as the source of flow and a generic target point @xmath24 as the target , it is possible to calculate the maximum possible flow from @xmath11 to @xmath24 by means of the min - cut , max - flow theorem @xcite . in general",
    "it is expected that more than a single unit of flow is exchanged from @xmath11 to @xmath24 by making simultaneous use of the various possible paths .",
    "the flow betweenness centrality of point @xmath10 is defined from the amount of flow @xmath28 passing through @xmath10 when the maximum flow @xmath29 is exchanged from @xmath11 to @xmath24 , by the formula : @xmath30 the second betweennes was introduced very recently in @xcite and is based on random paths .",
    "it is suited for such cases in which a message moves from a source point @xmath11 to a target point @xmath24 without any global knowledge of the network , and therefore at each step chooses where to go at random from all the possibilities .",
    "the betweennes of point @xmath10 is equal to the number of times that the message passes through @xmath10 in its journey , averaged over a large number of trials of the random walk .",
    "in this section we introduce the information centrality , a new measure based on the concept of efficient propagation of information over the network .",
    "the information centrality applies to points as well as to group / classes , and is defined both for valued and non - valued graph . for this reason we now consider a social network as a _ non - directed _",
    "( however the extension to non - symmetric data -digraphs- do not present any special problem ) _ valued _ graph @xmath4 of @xmath5 points and @xmath6 edges .",
    "a valued graph is a better description of a social system if the intensity of the social relations is a relevant ingredient that one wants to take into account .",
    "in fact the numerical value attached to each of the edges can be thought as a measure of the social proximity between two persons .",
    "consequently the entries of the adjacency matrix @xmath8 that describes @xmath4 are positive real numbers when there is an edge between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 otherwise .",
    "the most adopted convention is to consider the values @xmath8 as proportional to the intensity of the social connection .",
    "an alternative , although equivalent description , that we adopt here , is to consider such numbers as inversely proportional to the intensity of the social connection ; for instance @xmath8 can be set to be equal to the inverse of the number of contacts between two individuals , or to the inverse of the amount of time they spend together . in our description the value of an edge can be imagined as a length associated to the edge : the stronger the intensity of the social link , the closer the two individuals are . in a valued graph ,",
    "the shortest path length @xmath18 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined as the smallest sum of the edges lengths throughout all the possible paths in the graph from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath31 for all existing edges , i.e. in the particular case of a non - valued graph , @xmath18 reduces to the minimum number of edges traversed to get from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "+ the information centrality we are going to introduce is based on the following simple ideas : 1 ) information in social networks travels in parallel in the sense that all the individuals exchange packets of information concurrently ; 2 ) the importance of a point ( group ) is related to the ability of the network to respond to the deactivation of that point ( group ) from the network . in particular , we measure the network ability in propagating information among its points , before and after a certain point ( group ) is deactivated . + in order to measure how efficiently the points of the network @xmath4 exchange information , we use the _ network efficiency _ @xmath32 , a quantity introduced in @xcite . the efficiency is a good measure of the performance of _ parallel systems _ , i.e. when all the points in the graph concurrently exchange packets of information @xcite . such a variable is based on the assumption that the information / communication in a network travels along the shortest routes and that the efficiency @xmath33 in the communication between two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 is equal to the inverse of the shortest path lenght @xmath18 .",
    "the _ efficiency _ of @xmath4 is the average of @xmath33 : @xmath34= \\frac { { { \\sum_{{i \\ne j\\in { \\bf g } } } } \\epsilon_{ij } }   } { n(n-1 ) }            = \\frac{1}{n(n-1 ) } { \\sum_{{i \\ne j\\in { \\bf g } } } \\frac{1}{d_{ij}}}\\ ] ] and measures the mean flow - rate of information over @xmath4 . the quantity @xmath35 $ ] is perfectly defined in the case of non - connected graphs , in fact when there is no path between two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we assume @xmath22 and consistently @xmath36 . for a non - valued graph",
    "@xmath32 varies in the range @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "we are now ready to define point and group information centrality .",
    "it is important to say that the same ideas can be applied to define the importance of the edges of the graph @xcite    * point information centrality * the information centrality of a point @xmath10 is defined as the relative drop in the network efficiency caused by the removal from @xmath4 of the edges incident in @xmath10 : @xmath38 - e[{\\bf g}^{\\prime}_i]}{e[{\\bf g}]}\\ ] ] where by @xmath39 we indicate a network with @xmath5 points and @xmath40 edges obtained by removing from @xmath4 the edges incident in point @xmath10 .",
    "the removal of some of the edges affects the communication between various points of the graph increasing the length of the shortest paths .",
    "consequentely the efficiency of the new graph @xmath41 $ ] is smaller than @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the measure @xmath42 is normalized by definition to take values in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "it is immediate to see that @xmath0 is somehow correlated to all the three stardard centrality measures : @xmath1 ( formula [ dc ] ) , @xmath2 ( formula [ cc ] ) , and @xmath3 ( formula [ bc ] ) .",
    "in fact , the information centrality of point @xmath10 depends on the degree of point @xmath10 , since the efficiency @xmath41 $ ] is smaller if the number @xmath15 of edges removed from the original graph is larger .",
    "@xmath42 is correlated to @xmath43 since the efficiency of a graph is connected to @xmath44 .",
    "finally @xmath42 , similarly to @xmath27 , depends on the number of geodesics passing by @xmath10 , but it also depends on the lenghts of the new geodesics , the alternative paths that are used as communication channels , once the point @xmath10 is deactivated .",
    "no information about the new shortest paths is contained in @xmath27 , and in the other two standard measures .",
    "* group information centrality * analogously to point centrality , the information centrality of a group of points @xmath45 can be defined as the relative drop in the network efficiency caused by the deactivation of the points in @xmath45 , i.e. by the removal from graph @xmath4 of the edges incident in points belonging to @xmath46 : @xmath47 - e[{\\bf g}^{\\prime}_{\\bf s}]}{e[{\\bf g}]}\\ ] ] here by @xmath48 we indicate the network obtained by removing from @xmath4 the edges incident in points belonging to @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath49 is normalized to take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "we have concentrated in so far on the question of the centrality of a point ( and of a particular group of points ) in the graph .",
    "but it is also possible to examine to which extent the whole graph has a centralized structure .",
    "in fact , related to the point centrality measures , is the idea of an overall index of centralization of a graph describing to which extent the graph is organized around its most central point .",
    "indexes of graph centralization based on the standard measures of point centrality have been proposed over the years @xcite . here",
    "we propose a measure of the graph centralization based on the information centrality .",
    "the two properties common to all the graph centralization indexes , no matter the point centrality measure upon which they are built on , are : 1 ) graph centralization should measure to which extent the centrality of the most central point exceeds the centrality of the other points ; 2 ) graph centralization should be expressed as the ratio of that excess to its maximum possible value for a graph with the same number of points @xcite .",
    "we define a graph centralization based on the information centrality as : @xmath50 }              { \\max \\sum_{i=1}^n   [ c^i_{i^ * } - c^i_i ] }   =    \\frac { \\sum_{i=1}^n   [ c^i_{i^ * } - c^i_i ] }   { \\frac{(n+1)(n-2)}{n+2 } } \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the point with highest centrality .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath52 is the maximum possible value of @xmath53 $ ] , that is obtained for a star with @xmath5 points .",
    "the new measure of centrality we have introduced agrees with the three standard measures ( degree , closeness , betweenness ) on assignement of extremes . for instance it assignes the maximum importance to the central point of a star , and equal importance to the points of a complete graph . however the agreement breaks down between these extremes .",
    "consider , for instance , the graph sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , which is composed by two main parts , graph @xmath54 with @xmath55 points and graph @xmath56 with @xmath57 points ( @xmath58 ) , and by a single node @xmath10 , connecting @xmath54 to @xmath56 . for such simple example the information centrality contains some of the features of the betweenness (",
    "an actor is central if it lies between many of the actors ) .",
    "in fact the information centrality , similarly to the betweenness centrality , assigns the maximum importance to point @xmath10 , which certainly plays an important role since it works as a bridge between @xmath54 and @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    "it is very unlikely that the degree or the closeness centrality would attribute to point @xmath10 the highest score .",
    "the first , because @xmath54 and @xmath56 may contain points with degree larger than that of @xmath10 .",
    "the second , because the point with smallest distance to all the other points will probably be in @xmath54 , especially if we assume @xmath59 .",
    "we will now illustrate similarities and dissimilarities with the three standard measures by using as an example a non - directed non - valued graph constructed ad hoc .",
    "the graph considered , drawn in fig.[fig1 ] , is a tree with n=16 points and k = n-1 .",
    "the four centrality scores are reported in tab.[table1 ] .",
    "the points are ordered in decreasing order of @xmath0 .",
    ".the point centrality @xmath0 is compared to the standard centrality measures @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for the graph in fig.[fig1 ] . the points are ordered according to @xmath0 .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the dataset considered , the ranking of the 20 points produced by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the same .",
    "nevertheless the normalized values of these measures are different as reported in table [ table2 ] and as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we plot the centrality score for each of the 20 points .",
    "the points are ordered as a function of their score according to @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is similar although for the first five points the normalized values of @xmath0 are smaller than @xmath1 and larger than @xmath2 . for instance",
    "the first point in the rank , namely monkey 3 , has @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the two betweenness measures show some discrepancy with respect to the other measures .",
    "this is particularly evident in the figure for the flow betweenness : the two peaks at rank 9 and rank 12 , corresponding respectively to point 8 and point 5 , indicate that such two monkeys have , according to the flow betweenness , a rank larger that that assigned according to @xmath0 .",
    "+ we now consider the six different groups studied in @xcite : four formed by age and two formed by sex .",
    "group 1 contains the five monkeys having age 14 - 16 , group 2 the five monkeys having age 10 - 13 , group 3 the six monkeys having age 7 - 9 and group 4 the four monkeys having age 4 - 5 .",
    "group 5 is made by the five females , while group 6 is made by the fifteen males . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , among the age groups the most central one is the 10 - 13 years old ( group 2 ) , according to all the four measures .",
    "this is the group containing monkey 3 , who is the most central point also as an individual .",
    "the four age groups in decreasing order of importance are : 2 , 3 , 1 , 4 for the information centrality , 2 , 1 , 3 , 4 for the degree centrality , 2 , 1 , 4 , 3 for the closeness centrality and 2 , 1 , 3 - 4 for the betweenness centrality which assigns a score equal to zero to the two youngest groups .",
    "+ the information centrality is the only measure assigning the second position to the 7 - 9 years old , while the other three measures assign the second position to the 14 - 16 years old .",
    "the information centrality assigns last position to group 4 ( age 4 - 5 ) , similarly to the degree centrality and to the betwenness centrality .",
    "+ among the sex groups the most central one is the male group ( which is also the largest one ) for both information and degree centrality . the situation is inverted according to the betweenness centrality , while the closeness centrality attributes the same score to the two groups .",
    "+ in addition to groups formed a priori , like a team in a company or the division of the individuals according to age or sex , like the one we have considered above , the centrality measure we have proposed in this paper can be applied to set of individuals identified by cohesive subgroups techniques such as cliques , n - cliques , k - plexex , lambda sets etc .",

    "another possibility is to use the centrality measure as a criterion to forming groups : we are working on an algorithm to finding the groups inside a given graph based on the concept of graph efficiency and information centrality @xcite .",
