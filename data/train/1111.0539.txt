    "the transient regime of an ising system starting from equilibrium at a uniform temperature and then suddenly coupled to a thermostat at a different temperature , is an issue involving both practical problems and theoretical aspects of non equilibrium .",
    "for instance , as it is well known , cooling a system at a temperature smaller @xcite or equal @xcite to the critical one , gives rise to interesting dynamical out - equilibrium phenomena , where the transient regimes become indefinitely long .",
    "this approach , even for an artificial monte carlo dynamics , provides a deep insight in important physical problems , such as aging phenomena and coarsening of magnetic domains .",
    "we remark that within the usual canonical approach used in these studies ( e.g. metropolis ) , the interaction with the reservoir yields a uniform thermalization , a fact avoiding heat transport .",
    "therefore , in a canonical frame , the investigation of heat propagation during a out - equilibrium warming process is not even possible .",
    "this excludes interesting issues related to transport : which are the relevant parameters of the warming process , the role of boundary conditions , the space - time scales , the evolution of correlations aligned or transversal to the heat flow , etc . @xcite . in this canonical context heat transport",
    "can be studied only at interface separating two systems at different fixed temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to investigate heat transport phenomena in a transient regime , the appropriate dynamical approach should be the microcanonical one .",
    "this approach allows to couple the system to a thermostat and to investigate how the conserved energy flows within the system itself .",
    "however , so far , this approach has been largely neglected , possibly because of the need of a unique dynamical frame in a wide range of temperatures and/or of underlying geometries , not matched by standard microcanonical rules @xcite .",
    "now , a new efficient microcanonical dynamics has been recently introduced in @xcite , allowing for enhancements in the study of heat flow for a spin lattice coupled to thermostats at arbitrary fixed temperatures .",
    "indeed , among the advantages of this dynamics ( including e.g. the simple definition of local temperatures , the direct computability of conductivity , the possibility of applying to a great variety of discrete topologies and coupling patterns ) , there is also a property that the previous rules lacked , i.e. an efficient behavior in the whole range of temperatures from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we remark , that previous results for such a dynamics on homogeneous or disordered systems , are limited to the _ stationary _ regime , which is established after a long - time interaction between the systems and the thermostats @xcite . on the other hand , as already mentioned , here we focus on genuine non - stationary phenomena emerging when the system is suddenly put in contact with a thermostat at different temperature .    in particular",
    ", the system under study is an initially ordered rectangular lattice , where at time @xmath0 one side is coupled to a reservoir at fixed temperature @xmath2 , and consequently a heat diffusion takes place in the direction orthogonal to the hot side .",
    "this rectangle , in order to have a permanent state of transience , should be thought of as infinite in the diffusing direction . in practice",
    ", we shall take this size @xmath3 greater than the grid thermalized by the expanding heat front during a long observation time .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed in the transverse direction , so that the geometry reduces to a semi - infinite cylinder .",
    "some basic concepts of out - equilibrium physics , which have been developed for instance in the study of coarsening process , will be very useful also in our approach .",
    "in particular , dynamical scaling is a general tool that on one hand gives a simple description of the system evolution , and on the other it provides a theoretical basis for the introduction of universal concepts , such as correlation length and dynamical exponents . in this perspective , since for our dynamics a diffusive behavior has been proven @xcite , a generic observable @xmath4 is expected to depend on the time @xmath5 and on the distance @xmath6 from the reservoir according to the dynamical scaling : @xmath7 notice that the rescaling procedure allows to introduce a stationary approach even in the transient problem ; indeed , data obtained at different times can be compared to each other by a simple redefinition of distances : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a characteristic diffusive length .",
    "the most interesting feature we will evidence is that , in the presence of non - stationary heat propagation , the approach to equilibrium may be very slow , even when heating a system at high temperature .    in this context",
    "an interesting observable is the correlation @xmath10 , measured at time @xmath5 between the value of spins at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a line orthogonal to the heat flow at distance @xmath6 from the hot side . for @xmath13",
    "this correlation corresponds to the magnetic energy .",
    "since we are interested in the relaxation towards the equilibrium , we shall consider the quantity @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the correlation function of a system at equilibrium at the temperature of the heat reservoir .",
    "thus , @xmath16 tends to 0 in the limit @xmath17 ; moreover , according to the scaling ansatz @xmath18 is a function @xmath19 .    by numerical simulations ,",
    "first we check the scaling hypothesis , then we study the behavior of the scaling functions @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , after extensive monte carlo simulations , we obtain @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . in this context",
    "two simple behaviors emerge , namely @xmath23 and @xmath24 , for large and small temperatures respectively",
    ". we will show that a dynamics characterized by @xmath25 provides a reasonable description of the system evolution at infinite temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath26 is expected to be a good behavior for finite temperature systems . in this perspective",
    "the complex dependence on @xmath2 displayed by the exponents @xmath27 emerges as due to a dynamical crossover between the dynamics pertaining to finite and infinite temperature respectively .",
    "we notice that the diffusive behavior characterizing the dynamical scaling , as well as the exponential decay of the correlations as a function of @xmath28 , are expected features of the model ; indeed , the correlation decay is typically exponential in the ising model as soon as the magnetic domains are regular , i.e. outside the critical regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the way the correlations tend to their equilibrium values , i.e. by a power law in @xmath29 , is not so obvious .",
    "it seems that the system persists in a transient regime even for times much larger than the characteristic timescale of diffusion , which is proportional to @xmath30 . in some way , even at fixed distance from the thermostat there is not a characteristic time for which the equilibrium could be considered as reached .",
    "we will finally show that such a slow relaxation is a typical feature of open infinite systems where non - steady heat transport is present for all times .",
    "indeed , in a finite system , a rapid decay to the equilibrium value takes place as soon as the diffusion characteristic length @xmath31 is of the order of magnitude of the system size @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason the dynamics considered here can be adopted for the study of the stationary properties of finite systems , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ microdyn ] we briefly review the microcanonical dynamics exploited to simulate the evolution of the system , then , in sec .  [ sec : numerics ] we present the numerical results focusing on diffusion features , on correlations and on finite - size effects ; finally , sec .  [ sec : concl ] is left for conclusions .",
    "in order to be self - contained , we briefly recall the dynamics introduced in @xcite , whose main novelty consists in assigning to the _ links _ , beyond the usual magnetic energy @xmath32 , a sort of `` kinetic '' term @xmath33 which is a non - negative definite quantity able to compensate the variations of magnetic energy due to the spin flips involving the adjacent nodes @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this makes an essential difference with respect to the creutz microcanonical procedure @xcite , where a _ bounded _ amount of kinetic energy is assigned to each _ node _ : in that case , indeed , both the energy boundedness and the connectivity of the nodes entail many limitations , ranging from geometrical or topological constraints to non - ergodicity at low energy density .",
    "such limitations , as shown in @xcite , are efficiently solved by the new dynamics .",
    "an elementary move for it , starting from a random distribution of link energies , consists in the following :    1 .",
    "select randomly one of the four spin configurations for a randomly extracted link @xmath36 , and evaluate the magnetic energy variation @xmath37 due to this choice .",
    "if the coupling @xmath38 , as in the present case , @xmath37 is an integer whose value depends on the connectivity of the nodes @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; 2 .   if @xmath39 , accept the choice and increase the link kinetic energy @xmath33 of @xmath40 ; if @xmath41 , accept the choice and decrease @xmath33 of @xmath40 only if the link energy remains non negative , otherwise reject the choice .",
    "the unit time step consists of @xmath42 moves , where @xmath42 is the total number of links . since",
    "a link is defined only by the adjacent nodes , this rule applies on arbitrary non - oriented connected graphs , providing a great generality to the dynamics .",
    "we remark that at low energies the dynamics is rather time - consuming as for most of the extracted links the move is typically rejected ; yet , differently from the creutz procedure , here the dynamics works at any energy .    in @xcite , where a cylindrical lattice was considered ,",
    "many points have been numerically or theoretically supported , for both homogeneous and disordered cases .",
    "for instance , starting from the fact that magnetic and kinetic energies are non - correlated observables , that the boltzmann distribution is recovered at equilibrium and that the system results to be ergodic at all finite temperatures , it is possible to define the temperature @xmath43 by the averaged kinetic energy @xmath44 : this is a link observable , and therefore a local quantity working as a temperature also in stationary states far from equilibrium , i.e. states forced by thermostats at different temperatures .",
    "in order to study the transient regime , we deal here with the same simple cylindrical geometry considered in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a rectangular lattice of @xmath45 sites , periodical in the @xmath46 direction and open in the @xmath47 direction : the first and last columns , discrete circles of @xmath48 sites , are therefore open borders , in contact with heat reservoirs constituted by supplementary columns ( two for each side are enough ) .",
    "these reservoirs are kept at constant temperatures @xmath49 and @xmath50 by using the metropolis dynamics at equilibrium with appropriate temperatures . in most cases , for our present exigences , only the thermostat at the left border is fixed , while the right border is open and virtually placed at infinity ( i.e. very large @xmath51 ) . in the following we report and discuss the results obtained by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations performed on cylinders initially set at zero temperature , that is displaying an ordered magnetic configuration and zero kinetic energy on links .",
    "a given site @xmath34 will be denoted by the couple @xmath52 , where the integers @xmath6 and @xmath11 represent the distance from the reservoir and the position along the column respectively . moreover , in order to focus on the main features of the transient , presently we limit to the homogeneous case , i.e. the coupling constants are set equal to @xmath53 for any couple of neighboring sites .",
    "time is measured in mc steps , each corresponding to a total extraction of @xmath45 links , with consequent operations @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as described in the previous section . in this way",
    "we get temporal series for the main observables , such as the average magnetization @xmath56 and the average energy @xmath57 , for the @xmath6-th column at time @xmath5 , being @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the value of the spin on site @xmath60 at time @xmath5 and @xmath61 is the average over different thermal realizations ( typically in our simulation we average over @xmath62 thermal histories ) .",
    "thus , as the simulation is onset , heat starts to propagate within the cylinder : the absolute average magnetization decreases and the average energies of columns close to the thermostat increase .",
    "the first part of simulations is devoted to the analysis of heat propagation , and the longitudinal size is taken rather large and equal to @xmath63 , so that heat can flow for long times without feeling the influence of the second border . in the following part we focus on finite - size effects and we consider relatively small longitudinal sizes , that is @xmath64 . in any case , @xmath48 is kept fixed and equal to @xmath65 ; this large value is useful to avoid finite size effects and improves the statistics of the measures .      in the presence of a static heat flux ,",
    "the system behaves diffusively , as already noticed in @xcite .",
    "the present simulations confirm this picture even in a transient regime .",
    "in particular , relevant physical quantities such as the total energy along the @xmath46 direction @xmath66 grows as @xmath67 , that is the characteristic law of diffusive processes ; this asymptotic regime is reached only at very large times due to the extensive routines of the dynamics ( see inset of fig . [",
    "fig : diffusione ] ) . moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusione ] evidences that focusing on the direction of heat propagation , the system can be studied within the framework of dynamical scaling which is typical of out - equilibrium systems .",
    "more precisely , the quantities ( e.g. the local energy ) depending on both time @xmath5 and distance @xmath6 can be plotted in terms of a single rescaled variable @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the characteristic length of the process , so that data obtained at different spaces and times can be plotted together on a single curve .",
    "the fact that in our system @xmath70 grows as @xmath67 confirms the diffusive behavior of the model .",
    "of course , an equivalent scaling ( which has been used in our plot ) consists in introducing a rescaled time @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , we remark that the scaling approach is very general and does not depend on the observable we have considered .",
    "indeed we have checked that different observables , such as the magnetization and the correlation functions , display an analogous diffusive dynamical scaling .",
    "[ fig : diffusione ]    finally , it is worth deepening the relation between the dynamical scaling introduced above and the generalized fourier equation used in @xcite for the description of the model @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a diffusivity factor which , in quasi - equilibrium states , is just the ratio between the conductivity and the specific heat , so that the standard fourier equation is recovered .",
    "we recall that the previous equation is able to describe the heat propagation in very general conditions , independently of the existence of a local temperature @xcite .",
    "now , it is straightforward to verify that posing @xmath74 leads to @xmath75 i.e. the equation can be rewritten in terms of @xmath76 only . moreover , assuming that @xmath73 is a sufficiently smooth function writable as @xmath77 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : diff2 ] we can derive that the energy can be written as @xmath78 , namely @xmath79 ( at least at long times ) . as we will see in the following subsection , this estimate is consistent with our numerical results .",
    "the transient regime presents interesting properties not only along the direction of heat flow but also along the orthogonal lines . in this framework ,",
    "the simplest observable to consider is the two - point correlation function between spins of the same column at distance @xmath28 , i.e. : @xmath80 clearly , @xmath81 is simply the negative of the energy @xmath57 of the @xmath6-th column , i.e. @xmath82 . since we are interested in the long - time asymptotic behavior , we consider the quantity @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the equilibrium two - point correlation function between spins at distance @xmath28 in a 2-dimensional system evaluated at the same temperature of the thermostat .",
    "therefore , if the system approaches to the equilibrium , we have @xmath85 , as it has been indeed verified in all our numerical simulations .    in the ising model outside the critical regime , when simply connected domains are prevalent , the correlation functions decay exponentially with the distance @xmath28 , i.e. as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is defined as the correlation length . at equilibrium , @xmath87 depends on the temperature , while , in the coarsening processes , it grows as @xmath67 , due to the diffusion of the magnetic domains @xcite .",
    "[ fig : tri ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] shows the behavior of @xmath16 when the thermostat is at very large temperature , i.e. infinite for all practical purposes . in this case",
    "the equilibrium correlation function vanishes .",
    "the dynamical scaling picture is verified , since data evaluated at different columns ( e.g. @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) collapse by using the rescaled variable @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath91 . moreover , for large enough @xmath29 , simulations evidence that @xmath92 therefore , the correlation function presents an exponential decay with the distance @xmath28 and this is peculiar of the ising model outside the critical regime .    on the other hand ,",
    "an unexpected and interesting feature is the slow decay of @xmath93 as a function of @xmath29 , consistently with the predictions drawn in the previous section for @xmath13 .",
    "while in the standard mc approach a slow equilibration is typical of _ freezing _ only ( below the critical temperature ) , here we can appreciate a similar behavior also during the warming phase .",
    "in fact , a rapid equilibration would involve an exponential decay in @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , the heating process can not be considered concluded even for those sites whose distance from the thermostat is much smaller than @xmath70 , i.e. the characteristic length of heat diffusion . from a different point of view",
    ", the very slow approach to equilibrium can be described in terms of correlation length @xmath87 which , in our model , turns out to tend to zero logarithmically in @xmath29 ; indeed the correlation function can be written as : @xmath94 = \\exp(-n/\\lambda ) .",
    "\\label{logdecay}\\ ] ] we will show that the unexpected slow relaxation at high temperature emerges in open systems , while in the next section we verify that in small systems , where the boundary effects can not be discarded and heat can not flow freely , the thermalization process is exponentially fast at large enough times .    the scaling function in eq .",
    "[ logdecay ] presents a very simple structure .",
    "let us define @xmath95 and expand @xmath96 for small @xmath76 ( i.e. large times ) ; we get @xmath97 then , formula ( [ scal_inf ] ) can be recast as @xmath98 if @xmath99 , giving a description , at infinite temperature , of the asymptotic behavior of the model in terms of the analytic properties of @xmath96 .",
    "now , when the border is thermalized at a finite temperature , the main features characterizing the heat transport are preserved : as evidenced in fig .",
    "@xmath100 , scaling still holds with a definite diffusive length , the correlation functions decay exponentially and the approach to equilibrium is slow since the scaling functions vanish as a power law .",
    "however , here the analytic form of @xmath93 is not so simple ; in fact we have @xmath21 , and fitting procedures suggest that @xmath101 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "@xmath100 .",
    "[ fig : collassat5 ]      the exponents characterizing the slow decays appear to be temperature dependent with a non - trivial behavior .",

    "@xmath100 evidences that for high ( practically infinite ) temperature , @xmath25 , while , for low enough temperatures , @xmath24 independently of @xmath28 .",
    "this suggests that two simple ( asymptotic ) behaviors are present in the model : for infinite temperature the scaling function should be given by @xmath102,\\ ] ] hence , at infinite temperature , the dynamics is characterized by indefinitely shortening correlation length @xmath103 .",
    "this is clearly consistent with the fact that at infinite temperature there is not an equilibrium characteristic length , since the correlation function between any couple of sites is vanishing . on the other hand , at small temperature",
    ", @xmath93 decays as @xmath104 .",
    "however , since the exponential decay of @xmath105 as a function of the distance @xmath28 is an expected feature , we have @xmath106 where a characteristic length @xmath107 naturally emerges .",
    "we remark that at finite temperature the equilibrium correlation functions decay with a characteristic length @xmath108 .",
    "since a similar behavior is expected to be reached asymptotically also out of equilibrium , we expect that , eventually , @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the above regimes ( [ tinf],[tfin ] ) provide a reasonable description for infinite and finite temperature respectively .    in this perspective , the complex behavior characterizing intermediate temperatures would result from an interplay between these regimes .",
    "in particular , when the thermostat is at a finite temperature @xmath2 , @xmath19 evolves according to eq .",
    "( [ tinf ] ) until the correlation length @xmath110 becomes comparable to @xmath109 ; afterwards an evolution described by ( [ tfin ] ) takes place . at very large temperatures",
    "@xmath109 is almost zero and , in the considered time regimes , @xmath111 , therefore only the infinite temperature evolution ( [ tinf ] ) is observed . at low temperatures",
    "the correlation @xmath107 is so large that @xmath110 becomes quickly comparable to @xmath107 and @xmath112 evolves according to ( [ tfin ] ) .",
    "finally , the temperature dependent exponents @xmath27 observed at intermediate temperatures should be the result of the crossover between the two regimes which is ongoing in the considered time window .",
    "let us now discuss the finite - size effects in the processes of heat transfer from the thermostat to the system .",
    "finite - size effects can clarify some features outlined in the previous analysis , in particular the mutual influence between the transport regime and the way the asymptotic values are approached .",
    "@xmath113 shows the behavior of @xmath114 as a function of time for the column @xmath88 and a size @xmath64 . differently from the behavior depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusione ] , here the dynamics speeds up , approaching quickly the equilibrium value , for large enough times , i.e. when @xmath70 is comparable to the lattice size .",
    "therefore , the presence of very long transients described by a power law seems to be typical of infinite systems , while finite systems thermalize in a rapid ( possibly exponential ) way .",
    "this differences ensure that the dynamics may be used for the study of the stationary properties of finite systems as it has been done in @xcite",

    "the dynamical insight on the warming process in the ising model we have studied has two main aspects : first , a direct confirmation of such expected features as the diffusive behavior in the heat propagation , or the exponential decay of correlations in the transversal direction ; second , a clear indication about the role of heat flux in keeping the time behavior of correlations well distinct from their time - asymptotic `` equilibrium '' value .",
    "indeed , in the indefinite propagation taking place when the longitudinal size is much longer than the observation window , the approach to the limit obeys a power law in time .",
    "remarkably , a slow relaxation seems to be present for all temperatures .",
