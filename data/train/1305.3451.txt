    "in [ 1 ] we presented an alternative view and developed corresponding formal prerelativistic approach to description of time dependent electromagnetic fields in vacuum .",
    "our approach was based on the general view that no point - like and spatially infinite physical objects may exist at all , so the point - like directed idealization of coulomb law and the dalembert wave equation directed idealization of vacuum fields we put on reconsideration . such a view on physical objects , in particular , on free electromagnetic ones , as _ spatially finite entities with internal dynamical structure _ , made us try to work out a new look at the problem of choosing appropriate mathematical images for their physical and dynamical appearances , in general , and for their time stable and recognizable subsystems , in particular , during their existence . in other words , accepting the view for available internal local dynamical structure of free electromagnetic objects , to try to understand in what way and in what extent this internal dynamical structure determines the behavior of these objects as a whole under appropriate invironment .",
    "the assumed by us viewpoint there could be shortly characterised in prerelativestic terms as follows .",
    "time - stability of a free electromagnetic object requires at least two interacting subsystems , and these two subsystems can not be formally identified by the electric and magnetic fields @xmath1 , for example : the first - by @xmath2 , and the second - by @xmath3 , because _ a recognizable subsystem of a propagating electromagnetic physical object must be able to carry momentum _ , and neither @xmath2 nor @xmath3 are able to do this separately : the local momentum is @xmath4 . the supposed two subsystems might be formally identified in terms of the very @xmath1 and , if needed , making use of their derivatives . in order to come to a more adequate formal representatives of these two subsystems we paid due respect to the object that represents formally the physical nature and appearence of an electromagnetic object . for such mathematical object",
    "we chose the corresponding maxwell stress tensor @xmath5 .",
    "such a choice was based on the general view that the surviving flexability of any physical object is determined by its capabilities to act upon and to withstand external action upon , so the corresponding theoretical quantities describing the corresponding abilities in our case must have the sense of _ admissible changes _ of @xmath5 .",
    "this understanding directed our attention to the well known formal differential identity satisfied by @xmath5 , and brought us to the mathematical images of the two recognizable subsystems , to the differential relations describing their time stability , and to the special interaction respect these two subsystems pay to each other .",
    "going back to the subject of the present paper we note that after the deep studies of lorentz [ 2 ] , poincare [ 3 ] and einstein [ 4 ] , the final step towards _",
    "formal relativisation of maxwell electrodynamical equations _ we due to h.minkowski [ 5 ] , who explicitly introduced the new mathematics : local view on the space @xmath6 where @xmath7 is pseudometric tensor field , the classical electric and magnetic vector fields as constituents of a differential 2-form @xmath8 , maxwell equations in terms of @xmath8 on @xmath9 , appropriate 4-dimensional extension of maxwell stress tensor , unifying in this way the concepts of stress , energy and momentum as components af a symmetric 2-tensor field on @xmath9 , and representing the corresponding local conservation laws as zero - divergence of this tensor field .    later on it was found that maxwell equations presuppose in fact two differential 2-forms , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hodge star operator defined by the pseudometric @xmath7 on @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the prerelativistic maxwell system of equations in the vacuum case was represented in terms of the exterior derivative @xmath13 in the form : @xmath14 .",
    "this form of the equations stabilized strongly during the following years the belief in the 4-potential guage view : the basic mathematical representative of the field should be @xmath15-valued 1-form @xmath16 defined on the minkowski space - time , where @xmath17 denotes a basis of the 1-dimensional lie algebra @xmath15 .",
    "this view suggested to consider the 2-form @xmath8 as @xmath18 , to call it _ field strength _ , but it also reduced the equation @xmath19 to trivial and non - informative one . as for the other 2-form @xmath20 , its non - guage originated differential @xmath21 was kept in order to be equalized to the electric current 3-form @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",
    "this final relation we can not admit as sufficiently realistic , since mathematics requires on both sides of @xmath24 to stay the _ same _ quantity , and theoretical physics could hardly present a _",
    "physical quantity _ that could be equally well presented by @xmath21 and by @xmath22 in view of their _ quite different qualitative nature_. nevertheless , this formal view clearly suggests that , from physical point of view , the electromagnetic field should be considered as built of two interacting and recognizable subsystems formally represented by @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , such a view , somehow , was not adopted and further elaborated .",
    "we must note that this relativistic formulation _ does not introduce new solutions_. moreover , the new form of the equations and the new formal identity satisfied by the relativistically extended maxwell stress tensor , which was called stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 , do not introduce explicitly anything about possible nonzero local energy - momentum exchange between the above mentioned two subsystems formally represented by @xmath8 and @xmath20 ( see the next section ) . in this sense ,",
    "the essential moments of the old viewpoint on the field dynamics were kept unchanged , a serious physical interpretation of @xmath8 and @xmath20 as two physically interacting time - recognizable subsystems , guaranteing time - stability of an electromagnetic field object considered as spatially propagating and spatially finite entity carrying dynamical structure , was not given . in our view , such interpretation is still not sufficiently well understood today and considered as necessary , also , the null field nature of the stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath26 , according to us , is not appropriately appreciated , correspondingly respected , and effectively used .    in this paper we give corresponding to our view relativisation of [ 1 ] making use of modern differential geometry and extending appropriately the lie derivative of differential forms along multivector fields [ 12 ] to derivative of vector valued differential forms @xmath27 along vector valued multivector fields @xmath28 with respect to appropriately defined bilinear map @xmath29 . the role of @xmath30 is to recognize and partially evaluate _ algebraically _ and _ differentially _ the time - stable subsystems represented formally by the components @xmath31 of @xmath32 and @xmath33 of @xmath34 , and to separate corresponding interacting couples @xmath35 .",
    "we start with some general remarks .    first , under _ physical object / system _ , we understand _ a system @xmath36 of recognizable and spatially finite mutually supporting subsystems through energy exchange physical processes _ , some of these processes are among the subsystems of @xmath36 , called by us _ internal _ with respect to @xmath36 , e.g. , energy exchange between @xmath8 and @xmath20 in electrodynamics , otherwise , we call them _ external _ with respect to @xmath36 , e.g. , electric / gravitational field of a charged / mass particle",
    ".    second , the frequently used in literature concept of _ physical system in vacuum _ , we understand as _ physical system in appropriate media and available appropriate mutual interaction between the object and the media _ , quaranteeng corresponding time stability and admissible changes of both , the object and the media .",
    "in view of the above , for electromagnetic field objects we assume :    * 1 . *",
    "every electromagnetic field object exists through _ permanent propagation in space with the velocity of light_.    * 2 . *",
    "every electromagnetic field object is built of two _",
    "field subsystems_.    * 3 . *",
    "these two subsystems stay _ recognizable _ during the entire existence of the object .",
    "* 4 . * these two subsystems _",
    "appropriately interect _ with each other , i.e. , both are able to carry and to _ appropriately gain and lose energy - momentum_.    * 5 .",
    "* these two subsystems withstand nonzero _ recognizable _ local changes coming from the mutual local energy - momentum exchange , so we are going to consider these changes as _",
    "the obove views say that we consider electromagnetic field objects as _ real , massless , time - stable and space propagating physical objects with intrinsically compatible and time - stable dynamical structure , and their propagational existence includes translational and rotational components _ , where the rotational components should , in our view , be connected with the mutual local energy - momentum exchange between the two subsystems .",
    "compare to the standard view on electromagnetic field objects the obove numbered basic properties differ essentially in the final two : standard relativistic free field electrodynamics formally recognizes the two subsystem structure , but no recognizable and addmissible changes of each of the two subsystems , connected with energy - momentum exchange between @xmath8 and @xmath20 , is allowed by the equations @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , the divergence of the introduced by minkowski stress - energy - momentum tensor reads : @xmath38   \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\",
    "\\nabla_\\nu q^\\nu_\\sigma=\\frac12\\big{[}f^{\\mu\\nu}(\\mathbf{d}f)_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma}+ ( * f)^{\\mu\\nu}(\\mathbf{d}*f)_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma}\\big{]}.\\ ] ] therefore , if the changes of @xmath8 and @xmath20 , represented in classical relativistic electrodynamics by @xmath39 and @xmath21 , should be recognizable , and so formally to have _ tensor nature _ , they must not be zero in general , but the required equations @xmath40 forbid this .",
    "moreover , if non - zero admissible changes @xmath39 and @xmath21 are allowed , they may be appropriately used in describing the local energy - momentum exchange between @xmath8 and @xmath20 , justifying in this way the intrincic translational - rotational dynamical structure of a time stable and spatially propagating electromagnetic field object .    as for the property * 1 * , our understanding is that the minkowcki energy - momentum tensor @xmath41 must be _ isotropic / null _ , i.e. , @xmath42 , and this algebraic equation should be appropriately justified , respected and used , not just noted . in view of the importance we pay to it , we give in the next section proof of the rainich identity , which shows clearly how it is connected to the invariance properties of free electromagnetic field objects .",
    "we are going to sketch a proof of the important rainich identity [ 6],[7],[8 ] in view of its appropriate use in studying the eigen properties of the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor on minkowski space - time @xmath43 , and the hodge @xmath11 is defined by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the following relations are easily verified : @xmath47_\\mu^\\nu\\\\ \\frac14f_{\\alpha\\beta}(*f)^{\\alpha\\beta}id_\\mu^\\nu&= & f_\\mu\\,^\\sigma ( * f)^\\nu\\,_\\sigma=[f\\circ(*f)]_\\mu^\\nu= [ ( * f)\\circ f]_\\mu^\\nu \\\\",

    "we get to the rainich relation @xmath53id= \\frac14\\left[i_1",
    "^ 2+i_2 ^ 2\\right]id .\\ ] ] clearly , since @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 now the eigen relation @xmath56 gives the eigen values @xmath57    we recall now that under the duality transformation @xmath58 the energy - momentum tensor stays invariant , but the two invariants @xmath59 keep their values _ only if they are zero _ : @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the only dually invariant eigen direction @xmath61 of the energy - momentum tensor must satisfy @xmath62 , where @xmath41 must satisfy @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath41 becomes _ boundary map_. under these conditions the field @xmath10 is usually called _",
    "null _ field .",
    "we would like specially to note the conformal invariance of the restriction of the hodge @xmath11 to 2-forms .",
    "in fact , @xmath65 , and @xmath7 generate the same @xmath11 : @xmath66 @xmath67 it follows that the stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath68 transforms to @xmath69 under such conformal change of the metric @xmath7 .",
    "we begin with recalling that a null local isometry vector field @xmath61 on minkowski space - time generates null geodesics .",
    "in fact , @xmath61 must satisfy @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from these relations",
    "it follows that @xmath72 all free null fields @xmath10 , by definition , satisfy @xmath73 and _ in the frame of special relativity the minkowski metric @xmath7 does not change in presence of electromagnetic field objects_. therefore , the null isometry vector fields and the corresponding geodesics appear as attractive formal objects to be used in describing the dynamical behavior of the objects considered .",
    "the remarkable two properties of null em - fields , following from @xmath42 , are that such @xmath41 have only zero eigen values and that they admit unique null eigen direction locally represented by the vector field @xmath61 . as for the eigen vectors of @xmath8 , @xmath20 under null @xmath41 ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath60 , then all eigen values of @xmath8 and @xmath20 are also equal to zero and it can be shown [ 9 ] , that there exists _ just one common for f , * f , and q isotropic eigen direction , defined by the isotropic vector _",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath61 is local isometry for @xmath7 , and all other eigen vectors are space - like .",
    "thus , the availability of a null electromagnetic field allows to introduce corresponding sheaf of null geodesics , and this sheaf defines a sheaf of 2-dimensional space - like 2-planes @xmath75 orthogonal to @xmath61 .",
    "the set of these space - like 2-planes defines 2-dimensional foliation of minkowski space - time , and each such 2-plane is integral manifold of geometric distribution defined by the representatives of the electric and magnetic vector fields @xmath76 as tangent to the corresponding 2-plane .",
    "the above considerations allow to choose a global coordinate coframe on @xmath9 as follows [ 9 ] : @xmath77 and @xmath78 to determine coframe on each integral 2-dimensional plane of the distribution , @xmath79 to be spatially orthogonal to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and @xmath80 to denote the time coframe 1-form . denoting further @xmath81 , @xmath82",
    ", the zero values of the two invariants @xmath59 allow to consider the coframe @xmath83 , where @xmath84 @xmath85 are two functions on @xmath9 , as formal image of our field object .",

    "as we mentioned , the physical object we are going to mathematically describe by means of a _ system of partial differential equations _ on minkowski space - time satisfies the condition : its physical appearance is formally represented by @xmath10 , its dynamical appearance is formally represented by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath41 , which satisfies the relations : @xmath118 , hence , it allows to be viewed as built of two recognizable subsystems which carry the same local stress - energy - momentum .",
    "it follows from this view that , if these two subsystems interact , i.e. , exchange energy - momentum , they _ must be in a permanent local dynamical equilibrium : making use of their @xmath7 co - images they permanently and directly exchange energy - momentum in equal quantities without available local interaction energy_. 0.2 cm the apperant forms of the two space - time recognizable subsystems in our @xmath87-adapted coordinate system allow they to be mathematicaly identified by two subdistributions in the tangent bundle of minkowski space - time and to make use of their @xmath7-codistributions , so that , _ no admissible coordinate / frame change to result in nullifying locally or globaly of any of these two mathematical images of the two recognizable subsystems_.    it deserves also noting that the two subsystems recognize each other in two ways : algebraically - through the hodge @xmath11-operator ; and differentially - through the allowed local energy - momentum exchange .    of course",
    ", these two kinds of contact between the two mathematical representatives should be _ physically motivated _",
    ", i.e. they should reflect some physical appearances of the field object carrying such dynamical structure .",
    "we give some general preview consideration .    from algebraic point of view",
    "the exterior powers of a vector space naturally separate lineary independent elements : @xmath119 is not zero only if @xmath120 .",
    "so , if our physical object of interest is built of @xmath121 interacting and recognizable time - stable subsystems , it seems natural to turn to the exterior algebras built over corresponding couple of dual linear spaces .",
    "this view allows the well known concepts of interior products between @xmath121-vectors and @xmath122-forms [ 11,12 ] to be correspondingly respected and physically interpreted as flows , in other words , as quantitative measures of energy - momentum exchange .",
    "it deserves also noting that any choice of _ decomposable _",
    "@xmath121-vector @xmath34 over a linear space @xmath123 automatically defines a @xmath121-dimensional subspace @xmath124 .",
    "now , making use of the poincare isomorphism @xmath125 [ 11 ] we can determine the object @xmath126 , which defines a @xmath127-dimensional subspace @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the dual for @xmath123 space",
    ". two more subspaces , namely , @xmath130 , which is the dual to @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , which is the dual to @xmath133 , immediately appear .",
    "the above pure algebraic facts may be carried to tangent / cotangent bundles of a manifold @xmath134 through the well known concept of _ distribution _ [ 10,13,14 ] , i.e. , a sub - bundle of a tangent bundle .",
    "a basic tradition in physics , however , is measuring distance , which requires metrics / pseudometrics @xmath135 in theory .",
    "this allows to make use of the corresponding @xmath135-defined isomorphisms in the tensor algebra on a manifold , in particular , in the corresponding exterior subalgebras , composed with the hodge-@xmath136 operator , as an appropriate substitutes of poincare isomorphisms when possible .",
    "so , if the metric is known somehow , this leads to appropriate for theoretical physics explicit connection between tensors and co - tensors , in particular , between @xmath121-vector fields and @xmath137-differential forms .",
    "now , if we have come to the conclusion that a physical system @xmath36 may be represented by appropriate distribution @xmath138 on @xmath134 , we should keep in mind that the same @xmath138 may be defined by various appropriate non - singular multivector fields .",
    "this moment is very important when we introduce symmetries of @xmath138 [ 14 ] through lie derivative : a vector field @xmath96 is a symmetry of @xmath138 if for every vector section @xmath139 of @xmath138 we have that @xmath140=l_xy$ ] lives in @xmath138 .",
    "this suggests to understand the space - time evolution of @xmath36 along appropriate time - like or isotropic / null vector fields in the case of minkowski - like metrics .",
    "this concerns also the case when we try to look inside @xmath36 in order to distinguish time - stable recognizable subsystems @xmath141 of @xmath36 , trying to represent them by corresponding subdistributions @xmath142 of @xmath138 .",
    "now , the time stability of @xmath36 should , at least partially , depend on the available local interactions among the subsystems of @xmath36 , which interactions could be represented in terms of the curvature forms @xmath143 of the corresponding nonintegrable subdistributions @xmath144 , provided the values of @xmath143 are inside @xmath138 .",
    "we briefly give now the formal picture .",
    "recall that the duality between the two @xmath145-dimensional vector spaces @xmath146 and @xmath147 allows to distinguish the following antiderivation [ 11 ] .",
    "let @xmath148 , then we obtain the antiderivation @xmath149 , or @xmath150 , in @xmath151 of degree @xmath152 ( sometimes called substitution / contraction operator , interior product , insertion operator ) according to : @xmath153 clearly , if @xmath154 and @xmath155 then @xmath156 also , we get @xmath157 @xmath158    this antiderivation is extended [ 11,12 ] to a mapping @xmath159 , @xmath160 , according to @xmath161 note that this extended mapping is not an antiderivation except for @xmath162 .",
    "this mapping is extended by linearity to multivectors and exterior forms which are linear combinations .",

    "clearly , the bilinear map @xmath30 is meant to distinguish those couples of distributions which are in contact with each other through their curvature forms [ 15 ] .",
    "let s see now what minkowski space - time manifold @xmath206 may offer in this direction .",
    "the basic mathematical object on @xmath9 is its pseudometric tensor @xmath7 , it defines the mathematical procedure that corresponds to the experimental procedure for measuring space distance making use of light signals . in terms of @xmath7",

    "these remarks clearly support the opinion that minkowski has made appropriate steps towards mathematical identification of the two physical subsystems of an electromagnetic free object . also , the above remarks suggest to slightly modify the minkowski choice for mathematical identification of the field as follows : the two differential forms @xmath10 to be unified as one @xmath0-valued differential 2-form @xmath213 on @xmath9 , and their @xmath7-images to be unified as one @xmath0-valued @xmath214-vector field @xmath215 : @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a basis of the vector space @xmath0 , and the bar over @xmath8 and @xmath20 denotes the coressponding @xmath211-images . in this way , recalling the divergence expression for @xmath25 , we may directly turn our attention to the following four differential mutual flows @xmath218 as appropriate _ local _ energy - momentum balance quantities .      according to the above assumptions an em-_null _ field object must survive through space - time propagation during which it has to keep its structure through establishing and supporting internal dynamical equilibrium between its two recognizable subsystems .",

    "0.2 cm the equations we obtain are @xmath223=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since in our case the formal identity @xmath224 always holds , summing up the first two equations we obtain @xmath225 which coincides with the zero divergence of the standard and well trusted electromagnetic stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 : @xmath226= f^{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{d}f)_{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}+ ( * f)^{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{d}*f)_{\\alpha\\beta\\mu}=0 , \\ \\ \\alpha<\\beta.\\ ] ]    from the explicit expression of @xmath25 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath20 it is clearly seen that the full stress - energy - momentum of the field is the sum of the stress - energy - momentum carried by @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath227 , and the stress - energy - momentum carried by @xmath228 , i.e. @xmath229 .",
    "now , the algebraic @xmath219-symmetry equation @xmath230 requires @xmath231",
    "@xmath232    it follows @xmath233 , hence , the above equations @xmath234 , i.e. the algebraic and differential @xmath219-symmetry of @xmath213 with respect to @xmath215 , give : @xmath235 it is seen that the two equations @xmath236 and @xmath237 reduce to @xmath238 . in this way a permanent local dynamical equilibrium between the two subsystems formally represented by @xmath8 and @xmath20 is established .    the conformal invariance",
    "if these equations follows from the conformal invariance of @xmath239 , and every solution @xmath10 realizes the idea for _ local dynamical equilibrium_. in terms of the coderivative @xmath240 we get @xmath241 the coordinate - free form of these equations reads : @xmath242",
    "clearly , among the solutions of our equations there are nonlinear ones , satisfying @xmath243 , or , equivalently , @xmath244 .",
    "further we concentrate on the nonlinear ones .",
    "first we prove that all nonlinear solutions are _ null _ , i.e. , @xmath245 .",
    "recall the relations satisfied by any 2-form @xmath246 on minkowski space - time [ 11 ] : @xmath247 since all nonlinear solutions @xmath10 satisfy @xmath248 , from @xmath249 it follows that they must satsfy @xmath250 further , summing up the three systems of equations , we obtain @xmath251    if now @xmath252 , then @xmath253 ^ 2=(2i_1)^2.\\ ] ]    if @xmath254 , we sum up the first two systems and obtain @xmath255 .",
    "consequently , @xmath256 ^ 2=(2i_1)^2.\\ ] ] this completes the proof .",
    "hence , the corresponding @xmath257 is zero : @xmath245 .",
    "now , according to the rainich identity , this is equivalent to @xmath42 . in view of this , from the formal identity @xmath258 it follows that the two subsystems carry the same stress - energy - momentum : @xmath259 .",
    "hence , the above considered properties of null fields hold for all nonlinear solutions and the representation @xmath260 is allowed .",
    "this representation says that with every nonlinear solution @xmath10 three geometric 2-dimensional distributions on minkowski space may be introduced , such that :    - the distribution @xmath261 is completely integrable : @xmath262\\wedge\\bar{a}\\wedge\\bar{a}^*=0 $ ] .    - the other two distributions @xmath263 and @xmath264 are not completely integrable .",
    "the corresponding nonintegrability relations in terms of the codistributions read @xmath265\\omega=\\varepsilon\\mathbf{r}\\,\\omega;\\ ] ] @xmath266\\omega=\\varepsilon\\mathbf{r}\\,\\omega,\\ ] ] where @xmath267 , and @xmath268 $ ] denotes the corresponding curvature .",
    "the two curvature forms read @xmath269 on the other hand we obtain @xmath270\\rangle=                           % 9% \\langle a^*,[\\bar{a^*},\\bar{\\zeta}]\\rangle= \\frac12\\big[(u^2+p^2)_\\xi-\\varepsilon ( u^2+p^2)_z\\big].\\ ] ] clearly , the last relation may be put in terms of the lie derivative @xmath271 as @xmath272    * remark*. further we shall denote @xmath273 .",
    "we notice now that there is a function @xmath274 such , that    @xmath275 0.4 cm    it is immediately verified that @xmath276 is such one . 0.4",
    "cm we note that the function @xmath277 has a natural interpretation of _ phase _ because of the easily verified now relations @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 acquires the status of energy density . since the transformation @xmath281 is non - degenerate this allows to work with the two functions @xmath282 instead of @xmath85 , and the equations reduce to @xmath283 , so @xmath284 and @xmath277 is arbitrary .    from the above we have @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the coordinate - free definition of the energy density .",
    "this last formula shows something very important : at any @xmath287 the curvature @xmath288 will not be zero only if @xmath289 , which admits in principle availability of rotation .",
    "in fact , lack of rotation would mean that @xmath290 and @xmath277 are running waves along @xmath61 .",
    "the relation @xmath289 means , however , that rotational properties are possible in general , and some of these properties are carried by the phase @xmath277 .",
    "it follows that in such a case the translational component of propagation along @xmath61 ( which is supposed to be available ) must be determined essentially , and most probably , entirely , by @xmath290 .",
    "in particular , we could expect the relation @xmath283 to hold , and if this happens , then the rotational component of propagation will be represented entirely by the phase @xmath277 , and , more specially , by the curvature factor @xmath291 , so , the objects we are going to describe may have compatible translational - rotational dynamical structure .",
    "finally , this relation may be considered as a definition for the phase function @xmath277 .",
    "another interesting relations are the following : @xmath292 @xmath293 also , @xmath294 .",
    "hence , the two mutual flows are not zero only if the curvature @xmath288 is not zero , so , we can try the 3-form @xmath295 as possible carrier of spin properties of the corresponding solution .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the equations require @xmath290 to be running wave along the @xmath296-coordinate ( in the coordinates used ) , and arbitrary with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath297 : @xmath298 , so , it may be chosen spatially finite , and since it defines the energy density of the solution , then , since @xmath299 is local isometry , then the reduced to the 3-space 3-form @xmath300 may give finite integral energy . moreover , the choice @xmath301 , @xmath302 has dimension of length , is also allowed by the equations , which leads to @xmath303 .",
    "introducing now the 3-form @xmath304 its reduction to @xmath305 is @xmath306    on the two figures below are given two theoretical examples with @xmath307 and @xmath308 respectively , at a fixed moment @xmath309 . for @xmath310 ,",
    "the amplitude function @xmath290 fills in a smoothed out tube around a circular helix of height @xmath311 and pitch @xmath312 , and phase function @xmath313 .",
    "the solutions propagate left - to - right along the euclidean coordinate @xmath296 .",
    "the integral of @xmath314 over the 3-space for such solutions gives @xmath315 where @xmath316 is the integral energy of the solution , @xmath317 is the intrinsically defined time - period , and @xmath318 accounts for the two polarizations .",
    "clearly , this integral may be interpreted as spin - momentum of the solution for one period @xmath32 .",
    "finally , the constant @xmath312 may be intrinsically defined by @xmath319",
    "compare to the classical view , the basic difference of our approach to relativistically describe electromagnetic field objects consists mainly in the following steps : 0.3 cm 1 .",
    "these objects are considered as spatially finite and permanently propagating with the fundamental velocity `` c '' , so their stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath320 must be _ null _ : @xmath42 .    \\2 . every electromagnetic field object is a special kind of a physical object : it is built of two recognizable , time - stable and appropriately interacting subsystems , formally represented by the two differential 2-forms @xmath10 on minkowski space - time .",
    "the equations , describing the corresponding intrinsic dynamics and space - time propagation as a whole of an electromagnetic field object through their nonlinear solutions , represent the understanding that the @xmath0-valued 2-vector @xmath326 is @xmath327 - algebraic and differential symmetry of the @xmath0-valued 2-form @xmath328 according to the equations @xmath329 .    \\7 .",
    "the space - time propagation of an electromagnetic field object has a _",
    "compatible translational - rotational nature _ , and is characterized by a proportional to the object s integral energy _ spin momentum _ , locally represented by the @xmath330 _ nonzero _ local energy - momentum exchange .",
    "formally , the existence of non - zero spin momentum is measured by the frobenius non - integrability of the two geometric distributions defined by @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "0.3 cm the last ( no.8 ) step we consider as very suggestive in the following sense . when a continuous physical system consists of several recognizable interacting time - stable subsystems , and these subsystems admit natural representation as a number of geometric distributions and corresponding codistributions , then the frobenius integrability relations to be essentially used as local measures of time stability of the subsystems , and the available curvature forms to be essentially used as local energy - momentum exchange `` communicators '' among the subsytems .",
    "also , if the whole system admits formal representation as geometric distribution , in order it to be time - stable , an external local time - like , or isotropic , symmetry must exist .",
