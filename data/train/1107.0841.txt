    "after the discovery of the top quark  @xcite , a large number of events with @xmath0 pairs has been accumulated at the fermilab tevatron . a continuing discrepancy between the experimental measurements and the standard model ( sm ) prediction for the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry",
    "is observed in the data , both from the d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations .",
    "moreover , cdf has reported larger deviations for high @xmath0 invariant masses and for high rapidity differences .",
    "this situation has motivated a number of possible explanations that invoke physics beyond the sm .",
    "since @xmath0 production at tevatron energies is dominated by @xmath3 annihilation , @xmath4 , it is likely that the new effects , if present , take place in @xmath5 processes .",
    "furthermore , because the discrepancies are large , it is plausible that they are due to tree - level exchange of new particles .",
    "all the possible extra vector bosons and scalars that contribute to @xmath5 have been classified in ref .",
    "@xcite into irreducible representations of the full @xmath6 gauge group .",
    "these representations constitute a ` basis ' in which arbitrary new physics contributions at the tree level , in the form of heavy or light particles , can be expanded  much in the same way as a basis of gauge - invariant effective operators can be used to parameterise new physics corrections arising from a high scale . in practice , when performing explicit analyses , one needs to choose particular ` directions ' in the general multi - dimensional space of new physics models . hence , although the formalism is completely general , most of the proposed models in the literature actually correspond to one extra particle belonging to an irreducible representation . in this sense , these models can be considered minimal or , as we will refer to in the following , ` simple ' .",
    "the simple models which have received most attention are : ( i ) a new colour - octet produced in the @xmath7 channel  @xcite ; ( ii ) a flavour - violating @xmath1  @xcite or @xmath2 boson  @xcite exchanged in the @xmath8 channel ; ( iii ) a charge @xmath9 scalar exchanged in the @xmath10 channel  @xcite .",
    "some comparative studies between them have been performed , too  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exist several analyses in terms of effective operators , which are valid only for heavy new physics  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian can , under the assumption of decoupling new physics , be derived from the direct description in terms of extra fields , as done explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thanks to the fresh data quickly flowing from the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , these proposals will soon receive independent , often decisive tests .",
    "for example , the cms collaboration has recently presented the first measurement of a charge asymmetry in @xmath0 production at lhc  @xcite , @xmath11 the present number has a large statistical uncertainty , but a far better precision will soon be reached , while systematic uncertainties are also expected to improve with a better knowledge of the detector .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum is being measured with increasing precision at the lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "for example , with the luminosity of 1 fb@xmath12 already collected , around 180 semileptonic @xmath0 events ( up to detection efficiencies ) are expected at the tail with @xmath13 tev , so the cross section measurement will be dominated by systematics soon .",
    "the tail of the invariant mass distribution is expected to be especially sensitive to new physics in @xmath14 , since the @xmath15 and @xmath16 parton distribution functions become more important than the gluonic one for @xmath17 .",
    "there are various predictions of new signals at the lhc in other processes , expected in the different models that explain the excess in the fb asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases the nonobservation of those signals would not rule out a given scenario , as a null result can usually be accomodated with suitable adjustments .",
    "for instance , @xmath8-channel exchange of a real @xmath1 boson leads to like - sign top pair production  @xcite , but this signal is absent if a second , degenerate @xmath1 is incorporated with couplings such that the two extra bosons furnish a complex ( reducible ) representation .",
    "( equivalently , the complex @xmath1 boson can be assigned a `` flavour '' charge . )",
    "in contrast , robust constraints on models for the @xmath0 asymmetry can be extracted from the measurements in @xmath0 production itself .    in view of the many possible new - physics scenarios and of the new measurements expected soon , it is pertinent and timely to find answers to the following questions :    1 .",
    "how well do simple models fit the tevatron measurements ? 2 .",
    "what are the implications of the new lhc data on the parameter space of these models ? 3 .   what are their predictions for the charge asymmetries at lhc",
    "we have partly addressed questions ( b ) and ( c ) in previous work  @xcite , focusing on model discrimination by the simultaneous measurement of the fb asymmetry at tevatron and the charge asymmetry at lhc . in this paper",
    "we continue that analysis in several directions .",
    "first , we study ( a ) by comparing how different models fit the inclusive fb asymmetry measurement as well as the ones for high mass and high rapidity . in relation to ( b ) , we investigate the effect of a precise measurement of the @xmath0 tail , which would be dramatic for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models in case that the measurement agrees with the sm expectation within a @xmath18 .",
    "with respect to ( c ) , we explore the dependence of the predictions on the mass of the new particle , as well as different definitions of charge asymmetries at lhc .",
    "this study , clearly , requires a scan over all the allowed values of the couplings and masses for each model , which goes beyond usual analyses with a few selected benchmark points .",
    "it is also crucial to impose existing constraints from experimental data , in order to bound the range of variation for the predictions .",
    "the new particles that contribute at tree level to @xmath19 production can be exchanged either in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath10 channels , depending on their couplings ( which are conditioned by the gauge representation they belong to ) .",
    "the corresponding forms of the propagator have a significant impact on the invariant mass and rapidity distributions of the asymmetries and cross section .",
    "this can be used to classify the models in three groups :    * @xmath7-channel : for a heavy particle , both the cross section and asymmetries increase sharply with the invariant mass , more so in the region when the terms quadratic in the new physics are important .",
    "the effect becomes more acute as @xmath20 approaches the mass of the new particle .",
    "* @xmath8-channel : the propagator prefers forward top quarks , and increases the fb and charge asymmetries at high invariant masses and at large rapidities . * @xmath10-channel : the propagator prefers to send top quarks _",
    "backwards_. hence , it favours a negative asymmetry .",
    "of course , this effect is counteracted in the proposed models by the numerator of the amplitude , so that a positive fb asymmetry is obtained at tevatron . however , as the invariant mass increases , the rise of the asymmetries is damped by the influence of the propagator , and eventually the asymmetries become negative .",
    "these behaviours of the propagators are milder when the mass of the exchanged particle increases , in relation to the mandelstam variable in the denominator . in the heavy particle limit ,",
    "the propagator becomes constant , and the effect can be described in all three cases by a four - fermion operator .",
    "another important distinction between the different models can be made according to whether the ( positive ) asymmetry excess is generated at linear or quadratic order in the new physics .",
    "it has been remarked in the literature that the agreement of tevatron measurements of the total cross section with the sm prediction indicates that the new physics that enhances the fb asymmetry must interfere with the sm amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this condition is not very restrictive , however , as all the fields that can be exchanged at tree level in @xmath21 do interfere with the sm , unless some couplings are set to zero .",
    "it is maybe more useful to distinguish two scenarios , depending on whether the terms that are quadratic in the new - physics amplitude are essential or not to generate the asymmetry :    * _ ` linear ' new physics . _ for sufficiently small coupling / mass ratio , the impact of the terms quadratic in the new physics amplitude is small , and interference with the sm dominates . in this class of models ,",
    "the interference contribution to the cross section must cancel or be small . among simple models ,",
    "the former is only possible for a colour - octet vector boson with axial couplings either to the top or the light quarks ; the latter happens for a colour - sextet scalar .",
    "these models have the feature that the coupling can be smoothly varied between zero and some ( mass - dependent ) maximum while keeping agreement with the total @xmath0 cross section , for example . * _ ` quadratic ' new physics .",
    "_ these require large coupling / mass ratio , in order to make quadratic and interference terms comparable .",
    "then , the contributions of the latter to the cross section must be negative , such as to cancel the quadratic contribution .",
    "the problem with this scenario is that the cancellation imposed at a given energy is not guaranteed at different energies .",
    "hence , an agreement with the tevatron cross section typically leads to a significant excess in the lhc @xmath19 tail .",
    "they also have the feature that the allowed region for the couplings that generate a positive asymmetry is not connected with the sm point of vanishing couplings ; therefore , these models can easily be disfavoured by the upcoming precise lhc measurements .",
    "in this paper we study six models that are representative of these alternatives .",
    "they cover the different tree - level exchanges , and the scenarios with linear and quadratic new physics .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 initial states are both represented .",
    "our selection comprises the popular models mentioned in the introduction , plus a flavour - violating scalar isodoublet  @xcite .",
    "the possible quantum numbers and relevant interactions of the extra fields are collected in table  [ tab : lagr ] .",
    "we follow the notation in  @xcite for the different irreducible representations of the complete gauge group . to denotes an extra vector boson which is neutral under the full sm gauge group , whereas the name @xmath24 refers to any colour - singlet , electrically neutral vector boson , which could belong to different isospin multiplets .",
    "similarly , the charge  @xmath25 vector bosons @xmath2 can be isosinglets @xmath26 or components of isotriplets @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we only consider isosinglet @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons , but we still make these distinctions because the couplings of the new fields keep track of their complete quantum numbers . ] .",

    "the new measurements in top pair production at tevatron and the lhc will throw light on the present anomalies in the fb asymmetry .",
    "new effects , with definite patterns , are typically expected in most explanations invoking new physics .",
    "the new measurements will therefore discard some models and constrain the parameter space of the surviving ones . a good agreement of the lhc",
    "observables with the sm could also be a hint of less obvious forms of new physics , assuming that the tevatron excesses persist .",
    "this could , for instance , involve the interplay of several new particles plus a @xmath2 boson  @xcite , the different new particles contribute to distinct processes , so the combination does not help avoiding the lhc tail constraints . ]",
    "( see , e.g , @xcite ) , extremely large widths for resonances in the @xmath7 channel  @xcite , unparticle stuff  @xcite or loop effects from new physics  @xcite .    here",
    ", we have studied the tevatron fb asymmetry and charge asymmetries at the lhc , for a representative selection of models .",
    "we have focussed on the implications of the measurement of the cross section at the tail of the @xmath19 invariant mass distribution , which is especially sensitive to @xmath28 initial states .",
    "we have studied the effect on the asymmetries of requiring either a loose or a precise agreement with the sm prediction . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models are excluded as explanations of the tevatron anomalies .",
    "moreover , the allowed parameter space of most models is significantly reduced : among the simple models we study , only the axigluon and the scalar doublet are able to reproduce the cdf high - invariant - mass asymmetry within two standard deviations .",
    "we have also analysed the dependence of the tevatron and lhc asymmetries on the masses of the exchanged particles .",
    "this dependence , as well as the differences between different models , is intensified when the asymmetries are measured in events with high invariant masses .",
    "consequently , we stress that a study of the charge asymmetries in different invariant mass intervals at the lhc has a great importance to discriminate among different scenarios and , eventually , measure the parameters of a given model .",
    "finally , we have compared the sensitivity of different definitions of the charge asymmetries at lhc .",
    "we conclude that the simple `` inclusive '' definition in eq .",
    "( [ ec : acms ] ) , which uses all rapidities , is competitive with other proposals . even if the forward asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "( [ ec : acaf ] ) may perform slightly better for models in which the forward enhancement is very pronounced ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , these models will be ruled out soon , as explained above , if the @xmath19 cross section at lhc agrees with the sm prediction .",
    "nevertheless , having larger asymmetries in smaller data samples may constitute an advantage in the future when the measurements are dominated by systematic uncertainties",
    ".    _ note added . _ after the submission of this paper a new measurement by the d0 collaboration appeared  @xcite which agrees with cdf on the inclusive value of the asymmetry but does not find such a strong enhancement for high invariant masses .",
    "the implications concerning this measurement , or future ones , can easily be drawn from the plots presented .",
