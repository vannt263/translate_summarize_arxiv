    "there has been long discussion regarding the central structure of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "generally , it is believed that there is a supermassive black hole and a surrounding accretion disk .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to obtain direct information about the center of agn , the accretion disk , because the disk size is far too small to resolve . as for cosmological objects , e.g. , quasars , the ( angular diameter )",
    "distance is of the order of @xmath0 cm . if a black hole placed at the center has a mass of @xmath1 , the disk size ( say @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is schwarzschild radius ) will be @xmath4 cm .",
    "hence , apparent disk size ( @xmath5 ) is only @xmath6 .",
    "what is usually done is to observe the spectra , which are the sum of local spectra over the entire disk , and to make a fitting to the observed spectra by theoretically integrated spectra .",
    "however , there remain ambiguities as to the spatial emissivity distribution .",
    "the standard picture is that the so - called uv bump is attributed to blackbody radiation from the standard - type , optically - thick disks ( i.e. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "such a fundamental belief may be reconsidered by the recent hst observations that show no big blue bumps ( e.g. , zheng et al .",
    "1997 ) .    instead",
    ", microlensing can be used as a ` gravitational telescope ' to resolve the disk structure ( see blandford & hogg 1995 ; originally proposed by chang & refsdal 1984 ) , since a typical einstein - ring radius of a stellar mass lens is very small ; e.g. , @xmath7 for cosmological distant sources . with such a gravitational telescope",
    "we may be able to obtain information about the disk emergent spectra as a function of the distance from the central black hole .",
    "when a point source object is lensed , its luminosity is amplified without any color change .",
    "this feature is called ` achromaticity ' and is discussed in many literature , initiated by paczyski ( 1986 ; for a review see narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "but , in some actual situations , we can not treat a source as a point and the effect of a finite source size should be taken into account .",
    "grieger , kayser & refsdal ( 1988 ) examined such finite size effects .",
    "they simulated microlensing light curves for two different source profiles : stellar like and accretion disk like .",
    "the light curves show distinct shapes from those of point source calculations . however , they only considered monochromatic intensity variation .",
    "later , wambsganss & paczyski ( 1991 ) pointed out that if the finite size source has inhomogeneous structure so that each part produces a different spectrum , lensing light curves have wavelength dependence ; i.e. , chromatic features in microlensing events should appear .",
    "this chromatic effect has been investigated by several authors who calculated microlensing light curves of agn accretion disk based on simple disk models ( e.g. , rauch & blandford 1991 ; jaroszyski , wambsganss & paczyski 1992 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain some criteria for distinguishing disk physics based on more realistic disk models , we adopt the optically - thick , standard - type disk and the most successful , optically thin disk model , the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "so far nobody ( except yonehara et al .",
    "1998 ) has yet calculated x - ray or radio emission in the microlens events , due probably to the lack of reliable disk models",
    ". however , such calculations are of great importance since x - ray and radio emission seems to originate from the vicinity of a putative black hole . in section 2",
    "we describe our methods of simulation . in section 3",
    "our results are displayed .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discussion .",
    "first , we describe the adopted accretion disk models .",
    "we consider two representative types of disks :    \\1 . * optically thick disk : *    the first case we consider is the geometrically - thin and optically - thick standard disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "since we are concerned with disk structure on scales ranging from a few tens to a few thousands of @xmath3 , we ignore relativistic effects , such as the gravitational redshift by the black hole , for simplicity .",
    "the temperature distribution of the optically thick standard disk is then given by ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) @xmath8^{1/4 } { \\rm k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass accretion rate and @xmath10 is the black hole mass .",
    "the inner edge of the disk , @xmath11 , is set to be @xmath12 , the radius of the marginally stable last circular orbit around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "since the disk is optically thick , we can assume blackbody radiation .",
    "inserting the temperature profile @xmath13 into @xmath14                      \\delta s \\cos \\alpha , \\label{sandsl}\\ ] ] we can calculate the luminosity of a part of the disk with the surface element , @xmath15 , at a radius @xmath16 and a frequency @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a planck function ( e.g. , see eq.(1.51 ) of rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , and @xmath19 is the inclination angle of the disk . for simplicity , here , we assume the disk is face - on ( @xmath20 ) . it might be noted that the radiation spectra do not depend on the viscosity in this standard - type disks , since the total emissivity and the effective temperature are solely determined by the energy balance between the radiative cooling and viscous heating ( which originates from release of gravitational energy )",
    ".    \\2 . *",
    "optically thin disk *    the second model is the optically thin version of the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "we used the spectrum calculated by manmoto , mineshige , & kusunose ( 1997 ) and derive luminosity @xmath21 in the same way as we did for an optically thick disk : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is surface emissivity which include the effect of inclination angle ( details are given in manmoto et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", we also set @xmath20 ( face - on ) same as the case of optically thick disk . here",
    ", included are synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton scattering of soft photons created by the former two processes ( see narayan & yi 1995 for more details ) .",
    "optical flux is mainly due to comptonization of synchrotron photons .    in this sort of disks ( or flows ) ,",
    "radiative cooling is inefficient because of very low density . as a result",
    ", accreting matter falls into a central object , hardly losing its internal energy ( which is converted from its gravitational energy through the action of viscosity ) in a form of radiation .",
    "hence , although the total disk luminosity is less than that of the standard one for the same mass - flow rate , the disk can be significantly hotter , with electron temperatures being of the order of @xmath24k or more , thus producing high energy ( x-@xmath25 ray ) photons .",
    "photon energy is thus widely spread over large frequency ranges .",
    "since emission inside the last circular orbit ( at @xmath26 ) is not totally negligible in this case , we solve the flow structure until the event horizon ( @xmath3 ) passing through the transonic point , and consider radiation from the entire region outside the horizon , although the contribution from the innermost part is not dominant . unlike the optically thick case , the viscosity explicitly affects the emissivity in this case , since radiative cooling depends on density and is no longer balanced with viscous heating ( and with gravitational energy release ) . in the present study , we assign the viscosity parameter to be @xmath27 .",
    "although single lens approximation is not always appropriate to the microlensing events , we , here , use this simple method because of making the situation clear ( for extend source effect of microlensing by single lens object , e.g. , bontz 1979 ) .",
    "generally , the microlensed images are split into two ( or more ) images .",
    "when the separation between these images is too small to resolve , however , the total magnitudes of all the split images vary due to this microlensing caused by the relative motion of lens and source .",
    "the properties of microlensing have been extensively examined for simple cases where both the lens and source are regarded as being points ( e.g. , paczyski 1986 ) . in our simulation , we include an effect of occultation by a lens object which is recently included the simulation of microlense light curves by bromley ( 1996 ) for reality . in other words , we , here , consider that the radius of the lens object ( @xmath28 ) is same as the sun , i.e. , @xmath29 , and calculate image positions of the all cell .",
    "if the image position of a cell from the lens object is smaller than the radius of lens object , we exclude a contribution from that image .",
    "therefore , the total amplification ( or magnification ) factor @xmath30 for microlensing is exactly expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 corresponds to the angular separation between lens and source in the unit of the einstein - ring radius and always greater than or equal to zero , i.e. , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 shows that the image positions of two microlensed images from a lens object in the unit of radian , i.e. , @xmath35\\ ] ] this function as shown in eq .",
    "[ pointampli ] is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath32 ; @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . here ,",
    "the einstein - ring radius is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of a lensing star , @xmath44 is the speed of light , @xmath45 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 denote the angular diameter distances from lens to source , from observer to source , and from observer to lens , respectively ( paczyski 1986 ) . adopting an appropriate cosmological model , we can calculate these angular diameter distances in terms of redshifts @xmath48 ( from lens to source ) , @xmath49 ( from observer to source ) , and @xmath50 ( from observer to lens ) . in the present study",
    ", we assume the einstein - de sitter universe , in which we have @xmath51\\ ] ] ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) , where @xmath52 is hubble s constant , and the subscript ` @xmath53 ' stands for ` @xmath54 ' , ` @xmath55 ' , or ` @xmath56 ' .    since we now consider microlensing effects on an extended source",
    ", we must integrate the magnification effects over the entire source plane .",
    "we thus , as a next step , need to calculate the angular separation @xmath32 between a part of the source in question and the lens center ( see figure 1 ) , from which the amplification factor , @xmath57 , can be found . in the present study",
    ", we first divide an accretion disk plane into azimuthal ( @xmath58 ) and radial ( @xmath16 ) elements .",
    "the azimuthal coordinate is equally divided into @xmath59 segments ( @xmath60 ) , while the logarithmically scaled radial coordinate is also equally divided into @xmath59 segments ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we then calculate the observed flux at frequency @xmath17 from a cell between @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the radial direction and between @xmath60 and @xmath63 in the azimuthal direction . noting that photons emitted by the source at a frequency @xmath17 are observed at the frequency @xmath64",
    ", we write the observed flux as @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the amplification factor given by equation ( 4 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 is explicitly given by @xmath66^{1/2 } \\theta_{\\rm e}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the inclination angle of an accretion disk ( in this paper , as indicated in  2.1 , we set @xmath20 ) , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent the radial and the azimuthal positions of the lens in units of radians , respectively .",
    "schematic view of the calculated disk is shown in figure  [ schv1 ] .",
    "the intrinsic flux in the absence of a microlensing event , @xmath69 , is calculated from @xmath21 according to @xmath70 and @xmath21 depends on the disk model ( see eq .",
    "( [ sandsl ] ) and ( [ adafl ] ) ) . in the present study , since we neglected the relativistic effect ( e.g. , beaming , gravitational redshift etc . ) , @xmath71 has no azimuthal dependence .",
    "summing up @xmath72 over the entire disk plane from the inner boundary ( @xmath11 ) to the outer boundary ( @xmath73 ) , we obtain the total observed flux at frequency @xmath17 , or the spectrum of the microlensed accretion disk .",
    "for clarity , we consider a lensed quasar , q  2237 + 0305 ( the einstein cross , e.g. , huchra et al . 1985 ) .",
    "irwin et al . ( 1989 ) reported an increase of the apparent luminosity of image a by @xmath74mag on a timescale of a few months , which was nicely reproduced by a model of microlensing ( wambsganss , paczyski , & schneider 1990 ) . at present , at least five microlens events have been reported so far on the split images ( irwin et al . 1989 ; corrigan et al .",
    "1991 ; houde & racine 1994 ) . although the single lens treatment for q  2237 + 0305 may be a poor approximation ( see discussion ) , we just take this object as one test case and derive quite general conclusions regarding the generic observational features of microlensed accretion disks .",
    "this object is macrolensed by a foreground galaxy , and the source is split into four ( or five ) images .",
    "now , we suppose that one of the macrolensed image is further microlensed by a star in the foreground galaxy causing the macrolensing .",
    "although the macrolensed images are actually affected by two effects , so called , ` convergence ' and ` shear ' , we here neglect both for simplicity and thus assume that the macrolensed image is neither amplified nor distorted .",
    "the redshift parameters are @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "irwin et al . 1989 ) , and substitute them into the relation @xmath76 which can be obtained from flux conservation of radiation ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) , we get @xmath77 as for hubble s constant , we adopt the value obtained by kundi et al.(1997 ) , @xmath78 .",
    "the adopted disk parameters are the outer edge of the disk , @xmath79 , the mass of the central black hole , @xmath80 , and the mass - flow rates , @xmath81 g s@xmath82 for the standard disk and @xmath83 g s@xmath82 for the optically thin disk .",
    "we take different mass - flow rates for two cases because of calculation convenience .",
    "this is not , fortunately , a serious problem , since it has been demonstrated that the spectral shape of the adaf is not very sensitive to @xmath84 , although the overall flux level does change .",
    "we will not discuss the absolute flux in the following discussion , and focus on the relative spectral shape and relative flux variation .",
    "for other basic parameters characterizing the disks , see  2.1 .    for simplicity , we assume that the accretion disk is face - on ; i.e. @xmath85 , to the observer",
    "actually , based upon a grand unified paradigm of agns , quasars are not far from face - on views .",
    "we also assume the mass of a lensing object to be @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "the remaining variable is the angular separation ( @xmath32 ) between the lens and a part of the source in question .    adopting these parameters , apparent angular accretion disk size ( @xmath5 ) and einstein ring radius ( @xmath88 ) is @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these values are comparable and we , here , can use microlensing event as effective ` gravitational telescope ' ( blandford & hogg 1995 ) .      first , we calculated the microlensed spectra of each of two types of accretion disks for the angular separation between the lens and the source of @xmath91 , 0.1 , and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] for the standard disk ( in the upper panel ) and for the optically thin disk ( in the lower panel ) , respectively .",
    "for the former disk not only the disk brightening , but also substantial spectral deformation is produced by microlensing , when the angular separation is small ( rauch & blandford 1991 ; jaroszyski , wambsganss & paczyski 1992 ) .",
    "the smaller the angular separation is , the larger becomes the modification of the observed spectrum .",
    "in other words , the amplification factor depends on the frequency ( wavelength ) of the emitted photons .",
    "this gives rise to frequency - dependent , microlensing light curves ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "as for the optically thin disk , in contrast , there will not be large spectral modification by microlensing , but the flux is amplified over wide frequency ranges .",
    "to understand such spectral properties , we divide the disk plane into three parts ; @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , and plot the spectrum from each part of the disk , together with the integrated spectra , in figure  [ fig2 ] .    in the case of the optically thick accretion disk ,",
    "photons emitted from different radii have different dominant frequencies because the local temperature of the disk has a strong radial dependence , @xmath95 ( eq . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "note that without lensing the total spectrum has a peak at @xmath96 hz , but its low - frequency part has a smaller slope ( @xmath97 ) than that of blackbody radiation ( @xmath98 ) , thus a shoulder like feature extending to @xmath99 hz @xmath100 being formed .",
    "this is because the outer cooler portions also contribute to the spectrum . for @xmath101 ,",
    "therefore , the emission only from the inner , hottest part is strongly magnified , much strengthened a peak at @xmath96 hz @xmath102 and a shoulder like feature at @xmath99 hz @xmath100 appears to be weakened .",
    "consequently , microlensed spectrum became a form with one sharp peak .    to help understanding such situation",
    ", we also plot the radial distribution of emitted photons with several wavelengths in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows rather gradual change of each flux over a wide spatial range .",
    "this reflects the fact that viscous heating and radiative cooling are balanced in the standard disk .",
    "since the potential energy only gradually changes with the radius , so is the viscous heating rate and is the radiative cooling rate .",
    "moreover , the lower a photon frequency is ( or the longer the wavelength is ) , the wider becomes the parts of the disk which generate photons .    in the optically - thin accretion disk , on the other hand , the optical - uv flux is totally dominated by that from the inner region ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig3 ] clearly shows that almost 100% of optical flux originates from the region inside @xmath103 , and that the contribution from the outer parts is smaller by several orders .",
    "this is possible in adaf , since radiative cooling is no longer directly related to the shape of the gravitational potential well ( which has a rather smooth profile ) .",
    "the reason why optical flux is produced in a rather restricted region inside @xmath103 is due to enhanced synchrotron emission in the vicinity of the black hole , where density and pressure ( and thus magnetic pressure ) are likely to be at maximum within the flow .",
    "nearly irrespective of the @xmath32 value , as a consequence , it is always the innermost region ( within 10 @xmath3 ) that dominates the entire disk spectrum .",
    "the amplification of the total emission just reflects that of the emission from the innermost parts .",
    "therefore , the overall flux will be amplified by lensing without large spectral changes .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] also shows that x - rays are produced over a wider range ; the contribution from the outer part at @xmath104 is not negligible at frequency of @xmath105 ( a few kev ) .",
    "this is because of a bremsstrahlung emission from high - temperature electrons ( with @xmath106 being maintained at @xmath107 , see manmoto et al .",
    "we can thus predict that small frequency dependence will be seen in x - ray ranges in this model .",
    "such distinct spectral behaviors give rise to different light curves of the two disk models ( see below ) .",
    "using the results of the previous subsection , we now calculate the light curve during the microlensing events ( see fig .  [ schv1 ] ) .",
    "we continuously change the angular separation between the lens and the center of the accretion disk ( @xmath108 ) according to @xmath109 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] and calculate the flux at each frequency , where @xmath110 is the impact parameter ( in the unit of @xmath88 ) , @xmath111 is the transverse velocity of the lens and @xmath112 is the time .",
    "note that @xmath111 also includes the transverse velocity due to the peculiar motion of the foreground galaxy relative to the source and the observer .",
    "we calculated three cases ( see fig .",
    "[ disks ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the microlensing light curves of optically thick ( upper panel ) and thin ( lower panel ) disks for the case with @xmath113 ( case 1 ) .",
    "the light curve of the optically thin disk is still achromatic because of its flat temperature distribution , whereas the light curve of the optically thick one shows strong frequency dependence .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] is again useful to understand this chromaticity and achromaticity .",
    "since flux distribution is similar among different optical fluxes in the case of optically thin disks , each optical flux is amplified in a similar way and thus the color does not change ; i.e. achromatic feature appears .",
    "x - ray emitting region is wider than that of optical flux , small chromaticity may appear when we compare optical and x - ray light variations .",
    "in an optically thick disk , conversely , low - energy photons are created in a wider spatial range , compared with high - energy photons .",
    "if the microlensing event occurs , therefore , low - energy emission will be the first to be amplified , followed by the significant amplification of high - energy emission .",
    "note that each optical flux has the same level at the beginning ( at @xmath114 day ) in the upper panel of figure  [ fig4 ] , whereas a higher - energy optical flux is greater than that of a lower - energy flux in the intrinsic spectra in the absence of lensing ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the amplification of a lower - energy flux has already been appreciable at @xmath115 day .",
    "this results in the color change ; i.e. chromatic feature is produced .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the light curves for the case with a smaller lensing mass by one order and the same physical impact parameter ( @xmath116 ) ( case 2 ) .",
    "namely , @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "we see that if the lens mass is small , the peak magnification is reduced but the variability timescale is near the same at this range , while the chromaticity of the standard disk still remains .",
    "this is more clearly shown in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , in figure  [ fig6 ] , we assign a larger impact parameter ; @xmath118 ( case 3 ) .    in this case , not only the total amplification become small but also chromaticity of standard disks no longer holds .",
    "consequently , when we try to discriminate the disk structure , our success will depend not on the lens mass , but on whether the impact parameter is small or not .",
    "we will discuss this issue later ( in section 4 ) .    in table",
    "[ steepness ] , we summarize characteristic values of these three light curves .",
    "achromatic and chromatic features are clear in this table .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig7 ] shows the dependence of the spectrum on the lens mass .",
    "the smaller the lens mass is , the narrower the resulting shapes of the spectrum for a given flux value become .",
    "this is because when the lens mass is small , the einstein - ring radius is small ( @xmath119 , see eq . [ 5 ] ) , so is the size of the region undergoing microlensing amplification .",
    "this reduces the total light amplification .",
    "we have demonstrated how spectral behavior and microlensing light curves depend on the disk structure .",
    "we considered two representative disk models : the standard - type disk emitting predominantly optical - uv photons , and the optically thin , advection - dominated flow ( adaf ) producing a wide range of photons from radio to x-@xmath25 rays . using the microlensing events",
    ", we can distinguish the different emissivity distribution of agn accretion disks and will be able to map them in details and reconstruct them from the light curves .    at the peak of the microlensing event ,",
    "when the inner part of the accretion disk is largely amplified , distinctions between the two disk models are most evident ( especially when the impact parameter is small ) .",
    "thus , broad band photometry will be able to detect the color changes as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , thereby revealing the structure of agn accretion disks .",
    "fortunately , such observations do not require good time resolution ; for example , once per night like the macho project ( e.g. , alcock et al .",
    "1998 ) is sufficient , as long as a lens is located far from the observer .",
    "a typical timescale of microlensing event is characterized by the einstein ring crossing time of a lens object expressed as @xmath120 where @xmath121 means @xmath122 . for macho - like events",
    "when all the factors in the parentheses of eq .",
    "( [ eq : times ] ) are of the order of unity , the event timescales become @xmath123 yr . for the cosmological quasar case ,",
    "on the other hand , we find roughly @xmath124 , and thus , the third parenthesis became large by factor @xmath125 , yielding the event timescales being up to @xmath126 yr .",
    "thus , in principle , a few years observation is sufficient to obtain the information about central disk structure .",
    "practically , reconstruction from microlensing light curve that is so - called ` inverse problem ' is not so easy , because , this requires a lot more to be done , e.g. , take some ( noisy , not perfectly sampled ) light curve in a few filters .",
    "the source profile deconvolved by the observed light curve may comprise large errors , if the light curve sampling interval is much longer than the event duration timescale , or if the accuracy of the observed magnitude ( i.e. , flux from the source ) is much poorer , as stated before by grieger , kayser , & schramm ( 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , we need good time resolution not for discriminating accretion disk model , but for mapping detailed accretion disk .",
    "this reconstruction of accretion disk structure may be done in our future work .    to summarize the distinct properties of the two types of disks , we plot in figure  [ fig8 ] differences in the amplification factors at two different frequencies .",
    "open and filled circles represent the cases with @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the lensing mass is assumed to be @xmath86 . as the angular separation between the lens and the disk center ( @xmath32 ) decreases , @xmath129 increases ( thus the point moves in the upper right direction in figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the color changes are more pronounced in the right panel ( between the u- and k - bands ) than in the left panel ( between the u- and v - bands ) , and for smaller impact parameters .",
    "we can easily discriminate the disk structure by comparing the optical and ir fluxes if @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , as clearly seen in figure  [ fig8 ] , the wider the separation between two observed wavelengths ( or frequencies ) are , the more apparent differences between the light curves of the two disk models become . owing to this fact , the wider bands are preferable for more effective disk mapping .    as a first step to understand the microlensing phenomenon ,",
    "we have considered microlensing by a single star in the present study . however , the microlensing events caused by a single lens , especially the case in which differences between the light curves of the two disk models are apparent ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) , seems not so frequent for the actual objects . we thus need to evaluate the average time interval @xmath132 between microlensing events with an impact parameter smaller than @xmath110 . from paczyski ( 1986 )",
    ", we find that @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "if we regard the event that the impact parameter is @xmath134 as the microlensing event , one microlensing event which we are interested in will occur among @xmath135 to @xmath136 events .",
    "for example , we , here , assume the case of q  2237 + 0305 , although , in this case , single - lens assumption is not very good for this object because of its relatively large optical depth for microlensing ( e.g. , @xmath137 from rix , schneider , & bahcall 1992 ) .",
    "it is widely believed that microlensing does occur in q  2237 + 0305 at a rate of at least one event per year , i.e. @xmath138 ( corrigan et al .",
    "1991 ; houde & racine 1994 ) . hence , the microlensing event which we would like to observe is expected to occur once per @xmath139 yr ( for @xmath140 ) to @xmath141 yr ( for @xmath128 ) .    to conclude , microlensing events with such a small impact parameter may not be frequent , but once the microlensing with a small impact parameter occurs , a large light amplification is expected .",
    "we have demonstrated that an optically thick accretion disk exhibits more curious features in its spectral shape than an optically thin accretion disk .",
    "differences between these two disk models are , essentially , caused by different energy balance equations . in an optically thick accretion disk , generally , viscosity is small , accreting gas stays in the accretion disk for a much longer time than the disk rotation periods , so that gravitational potential energy of accreting gas can be effectively transformed into radiation on its way to the central compact object ( in the present case , a supermassive black hole ) . in an optically thin accretion disk , on the other hands ,",
    "since viscosity is high , accreting gas falls into the central compact object rapidly in timescale on the order of the rotation period , and gravitational potential energy of accreting gas is not so effectively transformed into radiation ( e.g. , kato , fukue , & mineshige 1998 ) .",
    "thus , most of gravitational potential energy of accreting gas is advected into the central compact object and is not radiated away .",
    "these major discriminant physical processes in the accretion disks can be distinguished by our microlens diagnostic technique .    in this paper , we assume that accretion disks are face on to the observer .",
    "in real situation , however , accretion disks may have non - zero inclination angles ( i.e. , @xmath142 ) .",
    "it will be complicated to quantitatively treat the dependence of inclination angles because of the increase in the number of parameters , such as the angle between the path of the lens object and the apparent semi - major axis caused by a non - zero inclination .",
    "qualitatively , non - zero inclination affects timescale of the microlensing event in such a way to reduce the apparent disk size by factor @xmath143 .",
    "this effect seems to be small except the case that the disks are nearly edge on ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) .",
    "this inclination effect will be systematically examined in a future work .    finally ,",
    "recent high - resolution observations , including those from _ hst _ , have revealed circumnuclear starburst regions in agns ( see umemura , fukue & mineshige 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "if starburst regions exist around an accretion disk , microlensing event of agn will make an interesting light curve ; large - amplitude , short timescale variation ( on a few months ) caused by the microlensing of the accretion disk will be superposed on more gradual light variation ( over a year ) caused by the microlensing of starburst region ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig9 ] , the size of circumnuclear starburst regions is a tenth or hundredth as large as the central accretion disk .",
    "hence , the microlensing timescale of circumnuclear starburst region is one tenth or hundredth as long as that of the accretion disk and the total amplification of the circumnuclear starburst region is smaller than that of the accretion disk from a rough estimate ( see eq  ( 2.28 ) of schneider , ehlers , & falco ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "thus , contributions of these two compositions to the microlensing light curve will be able to discriminate , and long - term monitoring may provide a possible tool to elucidate the extension of circumnuclear starbursts although the presence of intrinsic variability tends to make such analyses complex .",
    "the single - lens model as adopted in this paper is a good approximation , unless the apparent separations among lens stars are appreciably smaller than the radius of the einstein ring in the source plane .",
    "but , as we stated above , we should note that the images of q2237 + 0305 could be subject to microlensing by multiple stars of the foreground galaxy .",
    "that is , we must consider , as a next step , the microlensing events caused by ` caustics ' which is produced by multiple microlensing . such events may occur more frequently with shorter durations and steeper magnification ( wambsganss & kundi 1995 ) .",
    "light curves by the caustics will show even more interesting features than the present case ( schneider & weiss 1986 ) .",
    "more realistic , analytically approximated ` caustic ' calculation has been done for the case of q  2237 + 0305 ( yonehara et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this diagnostic method for the central region of agn can be used in other sources ( e.g. , mg0414 + 0534 , pg1115 + 080 , and the so - called ` clover leaf ' , h1413 + 117 etc . ) . future systematic and wide survey of quasars",
    "will discover other multiple quasars which our microlens diagnostic technique can apply .",
