    "suppose that the lie algebra @xmath37 generated by our hamiltonians @xmath38 is strictly smaller than @xmath36 and only limited unitaries are realizable by our control in the absence of the dissipation @xmath21 .",
    "how is the set of reachable operations enlarged by the action of a strong dissipation @xmath31 on the system ?    to this end we need to know how the system evolves under the influence of the strong dissipation @xmath21  @xcite . to begin with",
    "we consider the situation in which no drift term @xmath30 is present and the dissipator @xmath31 can be switched on and off arbitrarily as well as the control hamiltonians @xmath39 .",
    "afterwards we discuss the case in which we have no control over the dissipative part @xmath21 and the drift hamiltonian @xmath25 , assuming that the control fields are all constant .",

    "clearly this implies that if we prepare the system in a dfs , say in the @xmath45th dfs , it remains there evolving unitarily with the projected hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore if the evolution generated by @xmath31 is unital , i.e. , @xmath47 , the system evolves over the steady state manifold according to @xmath48 $ ] , and for an abelian interaction algebra  @xcite , generated by the @xmath9 s in   and their conjugates , we have @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is similar to that of the quantum zeno subspaces induced by other means , such as frequent measurements , strong continuous couplings , and frequent unitary kicks  @xcite .",
    "the projective measurement is effectively performed by the dissipative process .",
    "the measurement is nonselective  @xcite : the transitions among different subspaces are hindered and the dynamics within each subspace is governed by the projected hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "so far we have discussed the case in which the dissipator @xmath21 as well as the control hamiltonians @xmath39 can be controlled arbitrarily , in the absence of the drift hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "typically one has no access to the dissipative part @xmath21 in   that arises for example from an interaction with the environment .",
    "if we assume that the control fields are all constant , the generator   including the drift hamiltonian @xmath25 reads @xmath50 where we have introduced the constant @xmath51 that measures the strength of the coherent part @xmath52 $ ] in comparison with the dissipative part @xmath21 .",
    "based on a perturbative expansion it has been shown  @xcite that @xmath53 where @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the nonvanishing eigenvalues of @xmath31 , defines the longest relaxation time scale @xmath56 . the norm is the usual operator norm and @xmath57 . thanks to this , we notice that on a time scale on which the dissipative dynamics is much faster than the coherent dynamics , the dynamics is effectively governed by  . similarly to  , if the system is initially prepared in a dfs , say in the @xmath45th dfs , the system evolves unitarily within the same dfs in the limit @xmath58 with @xmath57 , driven by the projected hamiltonian @xmath59 .",
    "again , this is intuitively clear : if the dynamics is dominated by the fast dissipative process , the latter defines the subspaces within which the system can evolve .",
    "the presence of the coherent component @xmath60 only modifies the motion within each subspace .",
    "it is now easy to treat the general case  . in the spirit of the trotter formula , by switching among the control hamiltonians under @xmath58 and @xmath57",

    "the system is confined in the dfs s , evolving unitarily and steered by the projected hamiltonians .",
    "although the dimensions of the dfs s are smaller than the dimension of the original hilbert space , the dynamics induced by the projected control hamiltonians within the dfs s can be much more complex than the one induced by the original control hamiltonians in the absence of the dissipation , since @xmath67 is in general larger than @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "one can even achieve the universal controllability over the dfs s , with the help of the strong dissipation .",
    "on the basis of the observation that the projected drift and control hamiltonians do not necessarily commute any more , we saw in the last section that the lie algebra over the dfs s might be larger than the lie algebra over the original hilbert space . in the following we present three different examples , for which the universal controllability over the dfs s is achieved , even though only `` simple '' operations can be implemented over the original hilbert space in the absence of dissipation .",
    "we first provide a simplest example with only two qubits , which is essentially the same as that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite : one of the two qubits , say qubit 2 , is subject to a strong amplitude - damping process .",
    "we also discuss the same model but with a pure dephasing process on qubit 2 , instead of the amplitude - damping process .",

    "note that these hamiltonians commute with each other , @xmath73=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore in the absence of noise the lie algebra @xmath74 is spanned just by @xmath75 and hence is only two dimensional , @xmath76 .",

    "if qubit 2 starts from the state @xmath104 ( @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) the lie algebra over the @xmath45th dfs reads @xmath107 and qubit 1 is fully controllable .",
    "although in this case we do not have the full controllability over all dfs s , universal quantum computation is possible on qubit 1 within either of the two dfs s .",

    "besides being fundamentally interesting we now want to discuss in more detail the experimental feasibility of this observation . together with controlling commuting interactions , the main ingredient of the observed behavior is a strong dissipative process and the emergence of dfs s .",
    "thus , in practice , we need a system containing a subset of states that are stable on an appropriate time scale and a dissipative process decaying into this subset , while being much faster than other noise processes .",
    "an attractive platform that provides such a noise process is waveguide qed , i.e. , the interaction of quantum emitters with the modes of a waveguide , such as photonic crystal waveguides @xcite , optical fibers @xcite , and superconducting circuits @xcite . for further details regarding waveguide qed",

    "together with the ability to individually address transitions of the embedded quantum emitters waveguide qed systems provide therefore a promising platform for noise - induced universal quantum computation .",
    "we showed that every dissipative process exhibiting a dfs can enlarge the set of unitary operations that can be implemented by means of classical control fields .",
    "we provided three examples for which a universal set of gates can be implemented over a dfs whereas over the original hilbert space only `` simple '' operations are possible .",
    "in particular we showed that a realistic noise model can map a commutative classical system into a universal quantum one .",
    "numerical gate optimization was performed to study how strong the dissipative process needs to be to implement some unitary gate over the dfs with high precision . as a result",
