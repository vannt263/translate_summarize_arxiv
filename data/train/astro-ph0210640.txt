    "in quintessence models the current acceleration of the universe is due to potential - dominated evolution of a scalar field today .",
    "this typically implies that the potential is very flat today and hence that the compton wavelength , @xmath3 , is very large .",
    "this makes standard quintessence models difficult to distinguish from the simple cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) @xcite since clustering will only occur on scales larger than @xmath2 . moreover , quintessence models fulfill the condition of a large at all times . therefore two interesting questions are : + * ( 1 ) *    _ can we build models which are not associated with a large _    either today or at earlier epochs ?",
    "+ * ( 2 ) * _ are such models favoured or disfavoured by cosmic data ?",
    "_ + a strong affirmative to the second question would provide compelling evidence against both @xmath1cdm and quintessence . in answer to the first question we propose the idea of _ condensate dark energy_. in this scenario , part of the dark matter ( which we take to be cdm ) undergoes a transition to a condensate at some low redshift @xmath4 , described by a scalar field with equation of state given by eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) .",
    "such condensate models have previously been envisaged @xcite , though with slightly different properties .    to isolate the effects of the compton wavelength",
    "we must be sure that our models have the same background dymanics .",
    "we therefore use the model - independent parametrisation of the equation of state of @xcite ( and generalised in @xcite ) : w(z ) = [ w ] where @xmath5 is the final value of the equation of state , @xmath4 is the redshift at which @xmath6 changes from @xmath7 to @xmath5 and @xmath8 controls the rapidity of the transition .    in the case of quintessence",
    "we can impose this equation of state to hold identically at all times .",
    "however , for condensation we require that for @xmath9 it hold only on average , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this allows the potential to be very curved and hence for to be small and allow clustering on small scales .",
    "to compare our models we use all recent cmb data sets ( excluding archeops ) , the lss power spectra inferred from 2df , pscz , abell / aco and the binned sn1a data as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compute likelihoods over the 4d grid @xmath11 ) where @xmath12 is the hubble constant .",
    "we show the 1d marginalised likelihoods for our @xmath6 parameters in fig ( [ 1d ] ) for both condensation and metamorphosis / quintessence .",
    "we also plot the same curves when we introduce a gaussian prior for the hubble constant coming from the hst key project result : @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "overall the condensate model has a better best - fit @xmath15 than the best @xmath1cdm model .",
    "indeed , we found that for condensation the best - fit @xmath15 is 79.3 corresponding to @xmath16 , while for @xmath1cdm the best - fit @xmath15 is 84.9 , ( corresponding to @xmath17 ) .",
    "the best fits for metamorphosis are even better with @xmath18 for @xmath19 @xcite .    to understand why condensation does not favour @xmath20",
    "we note that this is due both to the cmb and lss . unlike quintessence models which have an almost trivial effect on the cmb ( see e.g. @xcite ) , varying @xmath4 in condensation affects the cdm density at decoupling and hence alters the gravitational potential wells .",
    "this effect is only significant for @xmath21 and boosts the height of the first acoustic peak relative to metamorphosis for @xmath22 while giving an asymmetric off - set pattern to the 2nd and 3rd peaks .",
    "the @xmath23 curves of fig .",
    "( [ cl ] ) can be understood by realising that they interpolate between standard flat cdm ( small @xmath4 ) and pure @xmath1cdm models ( high @xmath4 ) .",
    "while the total energy density of the universe is continuous across the transition surface at @xmath4 , the cdm density is not , since some of it is rapidly converted into dark energy .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath24 is _ not _ constant in this model , but jumps across the transition at @xmath4 .",
    "the smaller is @xmath4 , the larger this jump is , and hence the smaller is @xmath24 , and _",
    "vice versa_. this leads to the characteristic pattern of asymmetric 2nd and 3rd peaks seen for @xmath22 due to the change in the gravitational potential wells at recombination @xcite .",
    "the lss disfavours low @xmath4 since the turnover in the power spectrum occurs at too large a @xmath25 value , inconsistent with current observations @xcite .",
    "in quintessence the compton wavelength of the scalar field is always very large , which implies that the transfer function of fluctuations is trivial on large scales .",
    "this is not necessary for a successful dark energy model however and dropping this constraint yields a richer phenomenology .",
    "we consider one of the simplest models with a large change in : _ condensation _ , and find that it is a worse fit to the data compared with quintessence models if @xmath21 due to both cmb and lss constraints @xcite .",
    "it is important to realise that our conclusions with regard to condensation would be altered if we assumed a different value of @xmath2 initially by choosing our dark matter to be warm instead of cold . in that case",
    "we would probably have a better fit to the data for @xmath21 , especially regarding lss due to the well - documented problems of flat cdm models in fitting both cobe and @xmath26 constraints .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of condensation is that it opens up the possibility of having dark energy which non - trivially alters the cmb and cluster - scale physics .",
    "detailed analysis of condensation and comparison with quintessence / metamorphosis is reported elsewhere @xcite .",
