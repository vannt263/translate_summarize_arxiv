    "in a constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) the aim is to find an assignment of values to a given set of variables , subject to specified constraints .",
    "the csp is known to be np - complete in general .",
    "however , certain restrictions on the form of the allowed constraints can lead to problems solvable in polynomial time .",
    "such restrictions are usually imposed by specifying a constraint language , that is , a set of relations that are allowed to be used as constraints .",
    "a principal research direction aims to distinguish those constraint languages that give rise to csps solvable in polynomial time from those that do not .",
    "the dichotomy conjecture @xcite suggests that every constraint language gives rise to a csp that is either solvable in polynomial time or is np - complete .",
    "the dichotomy conjecture is confirmed in a variety of particular cases @xcite , but the general problem remains open .",
    "one of the important versions of the csp is often referred to as the conservative or list csp . in a csp of this type the set of values for each individual variable",
    "can be restricted arbitrarily .",
    "restrictions of this type can be studied by considering those constraint languages which contain all possible unary constraints ; such languages are also called conservative .",
    "conservative csps have been intensively studied for languages consisting of only one binary symmetric relation , that is , graphs ; in this case csp is equivalent to the graph homomorphism problem @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the dichotomy conjecture was confirmed for conservative csps .",
    "however , the proof given in @xcite is quite long and technical , which prompted attempts to find a simpler argument . in @xcite barto",
    "gave a simpler proof using the absorbing subuniverses techniques .",
    "in the present paper we give another , more elementary , proof that applies the reduction suggested in @xcite .    as in the majority of dichotomy",
    "results the solution algorithm and the proofs heavily use the algebraic approach to the csp developed in @xcite .",
    "this approach relates a constraint language to a collection of polymorphisms of the language , that is , operations on the same set that preserves all the relations from the language , and uses polymorphisms of specific types to identify constraint languages solvable in polynomial time . for example , to characterize csps on a 2-element set solvable in polynomial time @xcite it suffices to consider only 4 types of operations on a 2-element set : constant , semilattice ( conjunction and disjunction ) , majority ( @xmath0 ) , and affine ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the same types of operations characterize the complexity of conservative csps , except that constant operations can not be polymorphisms of conservative languages . in a simplified form",
    "the main result we prove is    [ the : main - intro ] let @xmath2 be a constraint language on a set @xmath3 .",
    "the conservative csp using relations from @xmath2 can be solved in polynomial time if and only if for any 2-element subset @xmath4 there is an operation @xmath5 on @xmath3 , a polymorphism of @xmath2 , such that @xmath5 on @xmath6 is either a semilattice operation , or a majority operation , or an affine operation .",
