    "the production of vortex arrays has , in fact , been crucial in demonstrating presence of a superfluid order parameter in the ultracold atom systems .",
    "aspects of vortex nucleation in ultracold atoms have been analyzed in various theoretical studies based on a mean - field treatment @xcite .",
    "more recently , attempts have been made to approach situations where the neutral atom vortices require methods beyond mean - field techniques .",

    "in recent studies , the strongly - correlated nature of the ground state around the region for quantum nucleation has been elucidated .",
    "the importance of such studies is at least twofold : firstly production of novel quantum states and secondly investigating the role of strong correlation in the nucleation process .",
    "two different physical scenarios were considered : in one of them the superfluid ultracold atoms were trapped in an optical ring lattice that can be rotated to introduce angular momentum into the system @xcite ; in the other the atoms were confined in a rotating asymmetric trap under conditions equivalent to having charged particles in a magnetic field @xcite . in the case of the rotating ring lattice the authors were most concerned with the production of schrdinger cat states , i.e.  macroscopic superpositions of states with and without a vortex .",
    "they were inspired by the similarities of this system with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) which exhibits macroscopic tunneling between states of opposite current flow @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",

    "the nature of the correlated states , while highly entangled , was clearly distinct from those produced in the rotating ring lattice .    in the present work",
    "we show how this difference comes about by studying the nature of the intermediate states , i.e.  the routes that connect states with and without vortices . by constructing effective hamiltonians",
    ", we clarify the competing role of interactions and trap or lattice asymmetry in each of these cases and show that the entangled nature of the ground state and the strong correlations involved in the nucleation process can be seen in quantum noise correlations .",
    "we believe that rotating atomic gases offer significant new opportunities to study strongly - correlated atomic systems .",
    "they may also have applications to areas where such states can be used in quantum information science and precision measurement .",
    "in this section , we investigate the effects of rotation on ultracold bosons confined to one - dimensional ring lattices and superlattices . this is an attractive system for study as it can be produced in the laboratory and isolates important issues of the underlying physics of the nucleation process .",
