    "the dilute ising model is self averaging so the quenched magnetization and the quenched surface tension can unambiguously be defined almost surely with respect to the dilution measure @xmath42 .",
    "it is tempting to try to adapt the previous heuristic to the case of the dilute ising model using the quenched surface tension in to describe the typical cost of phase coexistence .",
    "however , we must be careful .",
    "in much simpler models , such as random walk in random environment , it is well known that a small amount of randomness can change the asymptotic behavior .",

    "consider an expanding droplet of plus phase .",
    "if it encounters an area of high dilution it may get blocked and have to seep around the obstruction , slowing down its progress .",
    "however , dilution can also speed up the dynamics .",
    "the limiting factor in the undiluted ising model is the rate at which plus droplets nucleate .",
    "nucleation of plus droplets is infrequent due to the high cost of phase coexistence on their boundaries .",
    "the dilution creates atypical regions , which we will call _ catalysts _ , where the surface tension is unusually low and so the rate of nucleation is unusually high .",
    "the natural human response to catalysts is to try and classify them .",
    "some catalyst do not seem to have much effect on the relaxation time . consider ( when @xmath105 ) a circle where all the edges crossing its perimeter have been diluted .",
    "if a plus droplet forms inside the circle , there is no way for it to spread outwards .",
    "we therefore want to focus on catalysts that create a sheltered region to help plus droplets nucleate , but are not so closed off they prevent plus droplets from escaping . there seem to be two competing factors .",
    "large catalysts will be relatively rare and so the droplets they help to nucleate will take a long time to reach the origin .",
    "conversely , small catalysts can not do a great deal to increase the rate at which critical droplets nucleate .",
    "we conjecture that there is an optimal catalyst shape that determines the relaxation time of the system .",
    "however , we do not know how to calculate the optimal shape .",
    "in this paper we look at a restricted class of catalysts : surfaces of diluted edges that form open - bottom cones .",
    "we control the nucleation rate in the cones , and the subsequent growth of the droplet to regions of more typical dilution .",
    "this approach leads to an upper bound on the relaxation time that is much smaller than the time predicted by the formula with quenched surface tension .",
    "indeed , part ( ii ) of theorem  [ theorem : main ] shows that asymptotically in @xmath3 the values of @xmath13 differ greatly .",
    "we do not address the issue of the lower bound for the metastable time for disordered models .",
    "we believe that the more important point is to show the existence of the catalyst effect of the disorder .      in section  [ sec :",
