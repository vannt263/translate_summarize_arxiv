    "non - stationary time series have been investigated through several approaches . in particular , the characterization of fluctuations and their scaling behavior have been the focus of many studies , since they reveal the nature of the dynamics . in this context , financial time series have attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the large length of the available data of various stock market indices make them ideal candidates for analysis .",
    "furthermore , the complex dynamics of the variations in stock prices yield fluctuations which can show correlations , as well as scaling behavior .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to study the self - similar and correlation properties of nasdaq and bse indices belonging to two different economical environments .",
    "these stock indices belonging to developed and developing countries may show characteristic differences , possibly arising due to differences in their underlying dynamics .",
    "we concentrate on the nature of correlations and fractal behavior for which wavelet transform @xcite is used as a tool for extracting the fluctuations at different scales .",
    "a number of methods have been devised to find scaling behavior in time series .",
    "the well - known structure function method @xcite and the recently developed wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method @xcite , relying on continuous wavelet transforms , are widely used for the analysis of stationary data .",
    "the fact that most of the time series arising in real systems are non - stationary in nature introduces complications in estimating the scaling behavior , while using the above two approaches , which are global in nature .",
    "hence , in recent times , local approaches , like detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) and its generalization mf - dfa @xcite have been developed to handle non - stationary data . in this case",
    ", one uses windows of various sizes to separate fluctuations from the trend , which can also be shuffled to remove any correlation in the data set . while isolating the average or the trend of the data points in a given window , one takes recourse to linear or quadratic fit in the dfa approach .",
    "we have introduced a new method based on discrete wavelets @xcite to characterize the scaling behavior of non - stationary time series .",
    "the present procedure is similar to those in mf - dfa @xcite , except that in order to detrend , we use wavelets and mf - dfa uses local polynomial fits .",
    "recently , this method has been used by brodu , to analyze in real time , fractal behavior of dynamic time series @xcite .",
    "the relative merits of mf - dfa and a variety of other approaches to characterize fluctuations have been carried out in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that fluctuation analysis and characterization have been earlier attempted using haar wavelets , in the context of bio - medical applications , without the study of scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "wavelets from daubechies family are used for extracting trend from the given data set .",
    "fluctuations are captured by high - pass coefficients and the trend captured by the low - pass coefficients of wavelet transform . the discrete wavelet transform",
    "provide a handy tool for isolating the trend in a non - stationary data set , because of its built - in ability to analyze data in variable window sizes . in this note",
    ", we analyze returns of stock index values through our new wavelet based method .",
    "multi - fractal properties are also investigated using multi - fractal spectrum .",
    "we analyze daily price of nasdaq composite index for a period of 20 years , starting from 11-oct-1984 to 24-nov-2004 , and bse sensex index , over a period of 15 years , starting from 2-jan-1991 to 12-may-2005 .",
    "it is found that the nature of correlation is quite different between these two financial time series and significant non - statistical correlation exists in both of them .",
    "removal of the same reveals that bse index is primarily mono - fractal with the fluctuations showing a gaussian random noise character . on the other hand",
    ", the nasdaq index shows a weak multifractal behavior with long range statistical correlation .",
    "nasdaq daily ( close ) composite index for a period of 20 years , starting from 11-oct-1984 to 24-nov-2004 , [ b ] daily returns show more clusters of small and large fluctuations and [ c ] the returns after shuffling show disappearance of clustering behavior.,width=288 ]     bse sensex daily ( close ) index value for a period of 15 years , starting from 2-jan-1991 to 12-may-2005 , [ b ] daily returns show much less ( compared to fig . 1 ( b ) ) clustering of fluctuations and [ c ] the returns after shuffling show no significant difference in appearance relative to fig .",
    "2 ( b).,width=288 ]    from the financial ( nasdaq composite index and bse sensex ) time series @xmath0 , we first compute the scaled returns defined as ,        next , we carry out wavelet transform on the profile @xmath4 to separate the fluctuations from the trend by considering precise values of window sizes @xmath5 corresponding to different levels of wavelet decomposition .",
    "we obtain the trend by discarding the high - pass coefficients and reconstructing the trend using inverse wavelet transform .",
    "the fluctuations are then extracted at each level by subtracting the obtained time series from the original data .",
    "though the daubechies wavelets extract the fluctuations nicely , its asymmetric nature and wrap around problem affects the precision of the values .",
    "this is corrected by applying wavelet transform to the reverse profile , to extract a new set of fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are then reversed and averaged over the earlier obtained fluctuations .",
    "these are the fluctuations ( at a particular level ) , which we consider for analysis . in figs . 1 and 2 , we give the time series for the two index data sets , and the corresponding returns .",
    "we also show shuffled returns for the two series to examine the correlation as well as `` bursty '' ( clustering ) behaviour .",
    "the extracted fluctuations are subdivided into non - overlapping segments @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wavelet window size at a particular level @xmath8 for the chosen wavelet . here",
    "@xmath5 is the number of filter coefficients of the discrete wavelet transform basis under consideration .",
    "for example , with db-4 wavelets , @xmath9 at level 1 and @xmath10 at level 2 and so on .",
    "it is obvious that some data points would have to be discarded , in case @xmath11 is not an integer .",
    "this causes statistical errors in calculating the local variance . in such cases",
    ", we have to repeat the above procedure starting from the end and going to the beginning to calculate the local variance .",

    "furthermore , we observer that in case of bse sensex values , the calculated multifractal spectrum is much broader than the spectrum of shuffled returns , when compared to the nasdaq composite index values .",
    "in conclusion , the wavelet based method presented here is found to be quite efficient in extracting fluctuations from trend .",

    "it is interesting to note that the effect of country specific parameters like corruption on economic development and investment has been recently quantified through scaling analysis @xcite . in a similar manner ,",
    "the above observed differences between the two stock indices belonging to two different economic environment is probably due to local dynamics .",
