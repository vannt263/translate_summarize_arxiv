    "artificially designed nonlinear loss is a rather novel and highly promising way to generate deterministically non - classical states .",
    "nonlinear loss possesses a number of advantages over more usual nonlinear unitary dynamics .",
    "first of all , it can turn a mixed initial state into a final pure one , which is , generally , impossible with unitary transformations . then",
    ", the artificial loss is , actually , turning a greatest enemy of the non - classical state generators into their biggest ally . in schemes of generation of non - classical states via unitary dynamics linear losses are prone to destroy quantum features rather quickly ( here one might recall famous `` schroedinger - cat states '' turning into mixtures with the rate proportional to the average particle number of the state @xcite ) .",
    "however , nonlinear losses can force the system into a certain non - vacuum state ( `` pointer state '' ) , and make it remain there despite possible perturbations ( which was epitomized in a concept of `` protecting '' quantum states ) .",
    "then , the nonlinear loss generation scheme can be extremely robust , and is able to turn a wide variety of initial states into a predefined output state @xcite .",
    "for example , one can produce `` schroedinger - cat states '' @xcite , and fock states @xcite this way .",
    "the nonlinear loss can be a flexible and efficient tool of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress was achieved in development of practical realizable schemes of artificial nonlinear loss .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to produce a wide variety of nonlinear losses for vibrational states of ions in magnetic traps , or atoms in optical lattices @xcite . using a combination of optical nonlinearities",
    ", one can produce nonlinear losses of electromagnetic field modes . implementing correlated linear loss",
    ", one can also produce an effective nonlinear loss in bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "correlated loss gives an opportunity to design nonlinear losses for the generation of single - photon states and strongly sub - poissonian states in multi - core optical fibers @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted to analysis of possible states which can be produced with the help of designed nonlinear coherent loss quite commonly encountered in the schemes mentioned above .",
    "this kind of loss is able to produce a wide range of non - classical states .",
    "we discuss conditions and prerequisites for generation of such states , provide an estimation of fidelity and purity of generated states . in particular , we show how to generate an arbitrary fock state with fidelity arbitrarily close to unity using nonlinear coherent loss and an input coherent state . also , we analyze the generation of finite or countable superpositions of fock states .",
    "it appears that one can not reach a unit fidelity for generation of superposition of two fock states .",
    "the fidelity of such superposition generation gets worse when the states of the pair are strongly different in particle numbers . on the other hand",
    ", we show that it is possible to cut a countable set of fock - state components from the initial state with almost perfect fidelity , thus effectively `` combing '' the input state and producing almost pure state as the result .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ section0 ]",
    "we describe nonlinear coherent states and introduce a nonlinear coherent loss ( ncl ) . here",
    "also the the master equation for coherent losses is given .",
    "in section  [ sec1 ] we investigate general properties of the ncl and analyze their connection with features of a stationary state which is to be obtained with the help of the considered kind of the ncl .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the generation of pure fock states and consider the problem of coherence preserving for two important classes of states that can be generated by the discussed approach starting from a coherent state : superpositions of two fock states ( either including vacuum state or not ) and superpositions of states with photon numbers distributed with equal intervals ( e.g. states with even or odd photon numbers ) .    in section  [ sec3 ] the conditions ,",
    "necessary for complete preservation of coherence , are derived .",
    "it is shown that coherent states taken as starting states for the considered type of evolution do not satisfy the conditions exactly and , therefore , can not be used for creation of completely pure nonclassical states by nonlinear absorption .",
    "however , an optimal _ classical _ starting state belongs to the class of coherent states , and the final state , arbitrarily close to pure state , can be generated by choosing sufficiently high amplitude of the starting coherent state .",
    "in our work we consider dynamics of a single bosonic mode , described by the following standard master equation in the lindblad form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the decay rate and @xmath2 is the lindblad operator .",
    "we assume that our bosonic mode is described by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we shall consider the non - unitary dynamics generated by the following general class of lindblad operators @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a non - negative function .",
    "the lindblad operator ( [ operator f coherent ] ) can be considered as the annihilation operator of so - called @xmath8-deformed harmonic oscillator with the commutation relations @xcite @xmath9=(\\hat n+1)(f(\\hat n+1))^2-{\\hat n}(f(\\hat n))^2.\\ ] ] eigenstates of the operator @xmath10 were termed `` nonlinear coherent states '' @xcite ( it is curios to note that a specific subclass termed `` mittag - lefler coherent states '' does actually arise in micromasers in presence of loss and incoherent pump @xcite ) . for that reason ,",
    "we refer to the decay described by the lindblad operator ( [ operator f coherent ] ) as `` nonlinear coherent loss '' ( ncl ) in further consideration .",
    "it is interesting that any pure state non - orthogonal to an arbitrary fock states can be exactly represented as a nonlinear coherent state @xcite .",
    "if it is orthogonal to some fock states ( for example , if this pure state is a finite superposition of fock states ) , then one can still build a nonlinear coherent state closely approximating the state in question @xcite .",
    "thus , ncl looks highly promising for non - classical state generation . in ref .",
    "@xcite is was shown how to build a function @xmath8 leading to an approximate generation of an arbitrary fock state from the initial coherent one .",
    "in more recent work @xcite , it was shown that the single - particle fock state , @xmath11 , can be generated with arbitrarily high fidelity from the initial coherent state by the ncl with the lindblad operator ( [ operator f coherent ] ) with @xmath12 .",
    "it should be emphasized that ncl design is completely realistic and could be realized in practice . for vibrational states of ions in magnetic traps",
    "ncl is already realized .",
    "recently it was shown how to produce the ncl by simple adjustment of well parameters in the three - well trap configuration for bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "very recently the new realistic way of realizing ncl in multi - core optical fiber was suggested @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for experimentally realistic values of kerr nonlinearity of chalcogenide fibers with subwavelength core ( which is @xmath13 times higher than kerr nonlinearity of a conventional fused silica optical fiber ) , it is possible to realize ncl in such a scheme and achieve a deterministic generation of a single - photon state @xcite .",
    "note that the losses and imperfections of the scheme , generally , do not spoil the desired form of ncl ( however , they can lead to the appearance of other losses , both linear and nonlinear , spoiling the effect of ncl ) .",
    "the form of ncl is defined by the nonlinearity present in the scheme . for illustration in the appendix a an example of the nonlinear loss appearance ( and ncl appearance , in particular )",
    "is given for the system of nonlinear bosonic modes coupled to the strongly dissipative mode .",
    "in this work we do not intend to discuss practical realization of ncl in more details .",
    "our aim is more fundamental ; we want to discuss the very possibilities offered by ncl .",
    "further in this work we discuss general limitations on the states that can be generated by ncl starting from a coherent state .",
    "we demonstrate when it is possible to generate pure superpositions of fock states , and when losses lead to the decrease of the states purity .",

    "if the function @xmath92 has at least one zero @xmath69 , @xmath209 , and the initial state is classical , the final stationary state will be mixed .",
    "any classical initial state can be represented as a mixture of coherent states with positive weights .",
    "therefore , if we prove that the stationary state will be mixed for an arbitrary initial coherent state , the stationary state will be proven to be mixed for any classical starting state .    for the initial state being a coherent state @xmath87",
    "the following statement holds : @xmath210 therefore , eq .  ( [ eqn53 ] )",
    "is not satisfied except for the trivial case , when @xmath211 , @xmath212 .",
    "however , when the amplitude @xmath100 of the initial coherent state is large enough , the generated state can be very close to a pure state .",
    "indeed , only the density matrix elements @xmath213 with @xmath214 , @xmath215 have significantly nonzero values . for @xmath216",
    "( [ eqn55 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath217 therefore , eq .",
    "( [ eqn53 ] ) can be satisfied with arbitrarily high precision by using high enough amplitudes of the starting coherent state .",
    "we have investigated the nonlinear coherent loss as a resource for generating non - classical states . we have established conditions for generating a prescribed state ( namely , arbitrarily fock states and specific superpositions of them ) from the initial coherent state .",
    "we have highlighted a connection between properties of the lindblad operator of ncl and the generated state .",
    "we have demonstrated that the state generated by ncl from the initial classical state will always be mixed .",
    "however , for certain classes of states one can generate almost pure states . in some cases it is possible to reach high fidelity of the generation by appropriately choosing an amplitude of the initial coherent state .",
    "fock states belong to such a class ; one can generate an almost pure fock state for an initial coherent state of a sufficiently high amplitude .",
    "the situation complicates for finite superpositions of fock states .",
    "for example , a superposition of two fock states can not be generated by ncl with the arbitrarily high fidelity from the initial coherent state ; a strict upper border exists for this case .",
    "however , certain infinite superpositions can also be generated with an arbitrarily high fidelity .",
    "for example , one can `` comb '' the initial coherent state cutting off fock state components with odd number of particles with an arbitrarily high fidelity .",
    "finally , it should be noted that though coherent states are `` nonideal '' for generating states via the ncl , they remain optimal initial classical states .",
    "any classical state is a mixture of coherent states with positive weights .",
    "quantum mechanical equations for evolution of the density matrix are always linear .",
    "therefore , any final state obtained from a classical state , is necessarily a mixture of final states which are to be obtained from corresponding initial coherent states .",
    "thus , no classical initial state can lead to purity of the final state , greater than the purity , provided by `` the best choice '' from the possible the initial coherent states .",
    "the authors acknowledge the financial support by the brffi of belarus .",
    "they are very grateful to v. s. shchesnovich for helpful discussions .",
    "to highlight the concept of designing nonlinear loss in systems of coupled bosonic modes ( which can be realized , for example , in bose - einstein condensates @xcite or in optical fibers @xcite ) , let us consider a model of @xmath218 bosonic modes , @xmath219 coupled in the usual linear way to the same markovian reservoir .",
    "thus , the model is described by the master equation in the standard lindblad form : @xmath220 + \\gamma\\mathcal{l}_{n+1}\\rho_{n+1 } , \\label{lindblad multimode}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 is the hamiltonian describing unitary evolution of modes described by the annihilation , @xmath222 , and creation , @xmath223 , operators ; @xmath1 is the linear decay rate . here and",
    "in the derivation below we define superoperators @xmath224 on the basis of lindblad operators @xmath225 in the following way : @xmath226 in eq .",
    "( [ lindblad multimode ] ) the lindblad operator is @xmath227 it depends linearly on the annihilation operators @xmath222 and , therefore , represents a collective mode .",
    "one can introduce a new set of independent bosonic operators , @xmath228 , by the unitary transformation @xmath229 : @xmath230 where coefficients @xmath231 are fixed by the interaction between the system and the reservoir .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath221 , can be decomposed in terms of annihilation , @xmath232 , and creation , @xmath233 , operators of the collective mode : @xmath234 where operators @xmath235 depend only on operators @xmath228 and @xmath236 for @xmath237 .",
    "now we assume that the state of the collective mode @xmath232 decays to the vacuum very rapidly on the time - scale of dynamics prescribed by the hamiltonian @xmath221.thus , an adiabatic elimination of the mode @xmath232 can be made resulting in the following equation for the reduced density matrix of modes @xmath228 for @xmath238 : @xmath239 + \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{n!}{(n+1)\\gamma } \\mathcal{l}_{n}\\rho_{n } , \\label{lindblad multimode reduced}\\ ] ] where lindblad operators are @xmath240 .",
    "the master equation ( [ lindblad multimode reduced ] ) describes both possible interaction between modes @xmath228 and their nonlinear losses .",
    "note that @xmath241 might include nonlinearities not present in the original hamiltonian , @xmath221 .    even for low order nonlinearities",
    "the scheme described above is able to lead to the appearance of ncl . in ref . @xcite it was shown that the scheme ( [ lindblad multimode ] ) for the case of just two bosonic modes subject to kerr nonlinearity leads to appearance of ncl with @xmath242 ."
