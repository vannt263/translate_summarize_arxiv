    "this paper is concerned with the study of @xmath1 quantum field theories defined on a finite interval of length @xmath0 .",
    "when the bulk is massless and conformal boundary conditions are chosen , such theories can be entirely understood using the formalism of boundary conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the case where one deviates from this situation either by adding an interaction in the bulk or at the boundaries ( or both ) is more difficult , and quite interesting as it involves crossovers depending on the bulk and boundary mass scales as well as the finite size @xmath0 .    since the `` conformal revolution '' ,",
    "this topic was probably first considered in print in @xcite ( although it has been studied in unpublished work of a. zamolodchikov ) where the basic thermodynamic bethe ansatz and destri de vega ( ddv ) approaches were delineated in the case of simple integrable theories , mostly massive in the bulk , with simple boundary conditions . since then",
    ", the topic has attracted a fair amount of attention ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .    in the present paper , we discuss in details the limit complementary to @xcite where the bulk is a massless theory - mostly a free boson - and the perturbations sit on the boundary .",
    "we shall have mostly two theories in mind .",
    "the first is of the boundary sine - gordon model type .",
    "the terminology has somewhat changed since then , and boundary sine - gordon theory nowadays refers rather to a free boson with a cosine perturbation at the boundary . ]",

    "the case with @xmath7 could be called a `` double kondo problem '' . in that case , as usual , the @xmath8 dependence of the interaction can be traded for a coupling anisotropy in spin space - notice that we restrict to the case where the @xmath9 and @xmath10 sides see the same anisotropy , a condition necessary to preserve integrability .",
    "this double kondo theory musnt be confused with the two impurtity kondo model .",
    "although there also one would expect results to depend on the couplings for each impurity and the distance between the impurities , the detailed set - up is entirely different @xcite .",
    "there are plenty of physical motivations to tackle these problems . on the condensed matter side",
    ", they can be thought of as generalizations of quantum impurity problems , where the bulk of the theory gets modified by the addition of a single local defect , e.g. a boundary or a quantum degree of freedom .",
    "now , instead of only one impurity , we have two different ones coupled by a finite - size quantum field theory .",
    "one could label such a situation as a `` quantum bridge problem '' .",
    "an experimental setup for such problems could involve an interacting device - maybe a carbon nanotube or quantum wire - connected to two leads on either end . if the excitations of the device suffer from a gap when trying to infiltrate the leads , then in a first approximation all the action takes place at the contacts between the device and the leads .",
    "the excitations , upon hitting the contacts , will be reflected and mixed by the `` boundary '' according to some rules dictated by the specifics of the couplings , in other words the excitations will face some nontrivial , energy dependent boundary conditions , and the situation could be described by hamiltonians such as ( [ basic1],[basic2 ] ) in the low energy , universal limit .",
    "possibly the simplest example of such a situation occurs when one considers two different ( s - wave ) superconductors connected by a bridge made of a quantum wire , e.g. a carbon nanotube , a construction called a josephson junction .",
    "since both superconductors inherently possess a gap for electronic excitations within their bulk , an effective theory can be obtained by considering only the wire itself with two `` impurities '' on either side replacing the superconductors . solving this effective model - which is essentially described by ( [ basic1 ] ) leads to the determination of the josephson current @xcite .",
    "we do not know of any experimental condensed matter situation where the two boundary kondo model would be relevant ( although this does not seem impossible to imagine ) .",
    "the model has however appeared in string theory in the study of tachyon instabilities @xcite where the ends of the open string are coupled to a background , and the boundary spin acts in the space of chan - paton factors ( and the free boson corresponds to the @xmath11 coordinate ) .",
    "the double boundary sine - gordon model could presumably also be interpreted in the context of tachyon condensation following @xcite .",
    "notice that in the hamiltonian ( [ basic2 ] ) we have not introduced the phase difference @xmath12 .",
    "this is because such a phase can always be absorbed into a ( gauge ) redefinition of the spin operators @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , observe that a perturbative computation of the ground state energy of this model will only involve configurations of charges ( the charges in the boundary vertex operators ) which are independently neutral on the left and right sides , which leads to the possibility of shifting @xmath14 by a constant independently on each boundary ( notice also that this ground state energy will then expand in powers of @xmath15 .",
    "the situation for ( [ basic1 ] ) is very different , as all charge configurations which are only neutral overall ( ie by combining left and right sectors ) do contribute .",
    "the dependence of the ground state energy on @xmath12 is actually one of the main concerns of this paper .",
    "let us now give some generalities about our approach .",
    "we consider a strip of width @xmath0 and length @xmath16 , with euclidean coordinates @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 .",
    "we will mostly discuss the double boundary sine - gordon model in this paper ( [ basic1 ] ) , which belongs to a more general class of bulk and boundary perturbed conformal field theories , whose euclidian action can be schematically written @xmath19 here , we have as a starting point a cft with action @xmath20 , perturbed by some relevant operator @xmath21 contained within the operator content of that particular cft . in the presence of boundaries , one needs to specify conformal boundary conditions ( cbcs ) at @xmath22 , and include the nontrivial boundary effects as a perturbation on the cbcs by some relevant boundary operators ( in which we have included coupling constants @xmath23 ) @xmath24 at the left and right boundaries .    the theory ( [ basic1 ] ) turns out to be integrable",
    "this can be shown by a simple generalization of the argument of @xcite , which we discuss here for completeness .",
    "the lagrangian or perturbed cft approaches both provide a symmetric stress - energy tensor @xmath25 with components @xmath26 satisfying the continuity equations @xmath27 in the presence of boundaries , as was shown by cardy @xcite , the choice of conformal boundary conditions ensures that no momentum can flow through the boundaries , in other words that the off - diagonal components of the stress - energy tensor vanish at the boundaries , @xmath28 . in the presence of boundary perturbations",
    ", however , this equation gets modified to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is some local boundary field , which can be related to the boundary fields @xmath31 .",
    "consider now the integrals over a closed contour @xmath32 @xmath33 by the continuity equations ( [ continuity ] ) , these do not change under deformations of the contour @xmath32 : @xmath34 .",
    "let us now take @xmath32 to be the contour illustrated in figure [ firstcontour ] .",
    "we then can write @xmath35 the contours @xmath36 and @xmath37 , by equation ( [ boundaryt ] ) , can be seen to give the contributions @xmath38 if we take @xmath39 to be the time direction of our quantization scheme , this then shows that the quantity @xmath40 is @xmath39-independent , in other words is an integral of motion .    if the theory is integrable , these equations are but the first elements of an infinite series .",
    "then , there are an infinite number of local fields @xmath41 obeying @xmath42 in the bulk .",
    "provided they obey the boundary conditions @xmath43 for some infinite subset @xmath44 , the theory will remain integrable despite the boundaries , with integrals of motion @xmath45 + \\vartheta_{s;l } ( y ) + \\vartheta_{s ; r } ( y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ integrablebcs ] ) define the possible integrable boundary conditions .",
    "they formed the fundamental set of conditions used in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "integrability can be used in two different - and equivalent through crossing - ways to calculate the ground state energy . to see this ,",
    "let us switch to a hamiltonian formalism ; imaginary time can run along @xmath46 or @xmath39 . for time",
    "flowing along @xmath39 , it is natural to identify the first element of the infinite sequence of conserved quantities , equation ( [ firsthamiltonian ] ) , with the hamiltonian .",
    "the boundaries are thus true boundaries in space , and the bulk excitations satisfy appropriate boundary conditions . in this language , baptized the @xmath47-channel , the partition function is obtained by tracing over all such states , with @xmath48 as the inverse temperature : @xmath49 on the other hand , in the @xmath0-channel , we take time to flow along @xmath46 , from an initial state to a final one ( i.e. from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in the bulk is thus the usual one ( without boundary contributions ) , and the associated space of states is the same as in the absence of boundaries .",
    "the partition function now becomes a simple matrix element , obtained by sandwiching the time - evolution operator @xmath52 along time @xmath0 between the initial and final states ( the `` boundary '' states ) @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54    this latter point of view leads to the tba in the crossed channel , which we will use extensively in what follows . to handle",
    "( [ rchannelz ] ) one uses the description of the integrable theory as a massive ( if there is also a bulk perturbation ) or massless ( if the perturbation affects only the boundary ) scattering theory .",
    "such a theory is described by the spectrum of particles together with the bulk and boundary scattering matrices , and the constraint of factorized scattering .",
    "consider for instance the massive case , and parametrize energy and momentum of particles through a rapidty @xmath55 .",
    "the explicit form of the boundary states is @xcite @xmath56 where the amplitudes appearing in the exponential are given by the analytic continuation of the reflection matrices : @xmath57 using this basic ingredient , a straightforward method to compute the ground state energy was proposed in @xcite , in the case where bulk and boundary scattering are diagonal .",
    "the non diagonal cases require more work , and discussing them is part of our purpose here .",
    "it so turned out however that even in the diagonal case , considerable surprises are encountered - as was first discovered in @xcite - due in part to the way the bare couplings are encoded in the boundary scattering description .",
    "calculating the correct ground state energy requires analytical continuation of the results of @xcite , a process which is quite difficult .",
    "the case of double kondo model ( [ basic2 ] ) is a bit different , as there are additional boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "the proof of integrability would proceed along similar lines , with appropriate modifications as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the boundary state formalism can also be generalized to this case .",
    "we will , however , take a different approach based on the destri - de vega formalism .",
    "most of this paper is devoted to the double boundary sine - gordon model ( sections 2 to 6 ) .",
    "we will also present results for the double kondo model in section 7 .",
    "we shall first discuss analytic continuation by considering the case of the ising model in section 2 . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we extend the analysis of @xcite to the case where the boundary scattering is non diagonal while the bulk scattering is still diagonal .",
    "the analytical continuation is carried out as a simple generalization of section 2 for the case @xmath58 ( many of the results of this section have been previously published in @xcite , but we include a more thorough explanation here , which helps to understand the generalizations we propose ) .",
    "the other `` reflectionless cases '' require considerably more work ; only the case @xmath59 is fully discussed , in section 5 .",
    "the double kondo model is tackled in section 6 ; there , the bulk and boundary interactions are non diagonal , and we use a different method , based on the often called destri - de vega approach @xcite ( although the method has been used before in slightly different settings @xcite ) .",
    "let us now turn to a specific example , and consider the ising model . as is well - known",
    ", the bulk action of this theory takes the form of a free action for majorana fermions @xmath60 . at the left and right boundaries @xmath61",
    ", there are two ( in general different ) values of the boundary magnetic field @xmath62 coupled to the local boundary spin operators @xmath63 where @xmath64 are boundary fermions , and we have chosen a convenient normalization . the total action is @xmath65 + \\int dy ( { \\cal l}_l + { \\cal l}_r ) , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "consider thus a theory that is conformal in the bulk , and is subject to boundary perturbations at the left and right edges with coupling constants @xmath66 .",

    "we introduce a conformal mapping by defining the new coordinates @xmath70 in such a way that the original strip maps to the half - disc , as illustrated in figure [ mapping ] .",
    "the boundary is the horizontal axis , the perturbation for @xmath51 now sitting on the boundary @xmath71 , and the one for @xmath50 sitting on the one for @xmath72 . introducing @xmath73 the dimension of the operators @xmath74 ( such that the two point function on the boundary goes as @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 , we find @xmath77|0>.\\ ] ]    the strategy is to evaluate @xmath78 for large @xmath47 , and extract the leading term proportional to @xmath47 , since in that limit one has @xmath79 .",

    "let us get back now to the particular case of the ising model and consider the simplest case where one of the boundary fields vanishes , the other being equal to @xmath81 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 in which @xmath84 means that the correlators are evaluated in the unperturbed cft .",
    "evaluation to first two non trivial orders gives @xmath85 the first term is manifestly divergent ( as would be seen as well from ( [ firstgene ] ) ) , and requires some extra regularization . since it diverges logarithmically , it is natural to expect any dimensionally regularized version of this term ( such as given by the tba ) to go as @xmath86 .",
    "the next term , like all the subsequent ones , is well - defined .",
    "the sum can be evaluated in closed form : @xmath87 giving rise to @xmath88    higher orders could be obtained without too much difficulty , but the foregoing expression will serve our purposes .",
    "let us now compare it with the non perturbative results obtained from the tba .",

    "surprises start when one considers the case of two non - vanishing applied fields @xmath99 .",
    "the tba approach then gives @xmath100\\label{tbai}\\ ] ] this _ is _ confusing because it _",
    "seems _ to have an expansion in powers of @xmath101 and @xmath102 only , a result in manifest contradiction with perturbative calculations . related to this puzzle",
    "is the fact that ( [ tbai ] ) is the same for @xmath103 and @xmath104 while the two cases ought to be different based on even simpler arguments than perturbation theory : indeed , in the limit of large fields , the first case describes a partition function with fixed @xmath105 boundary conditions , and @xmath106 , while the one describes a partition function with fixed @xmath107 boundary conditions , and @xmath108 , the difference corresponding to the boundary dimension of the spin operator , @xmath109 .    to make things more precise",
    ", the perturbative expansion ( [ firstgene ] ) leads , at second order , to @xmath110 to solve the apparent contradiction with ( [ tbai ] ) we attempt to expand it in powers of the magnetic fields .",

    "we thus resolve in a simple way the first paradox , by recognizing that the tba integral must expand in fact powers of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , not @xmath125 , @xmath126 , at least when both fields are positive ( devising a scheme to perform this expansion is another matter ) .",
    "there does remain a bigger problem , which is that the expansion of the tba formula ( [ tbai ] ) is in powers of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and thus does not see the difference between the cases @xmath103 and @xmath129 ( the cases @xmath130 and @xmath131 being meanwhile equivalent by spin reversal symmetry ) .",
    "the reason why we have this problem seems interesting .",
    "we do not think we understand it fully , but an important hint can be found by going for a while to the initial description based on the ordered , massive phase ( that is , before we take the massless limit ) .",
    "the @xmath0 matrix is calculated with a single ( say , right ) boundary at @xmath51 , but of course , the problem is undefined until one has set proper boundary conditions at ( left ) @xmath132 .",
    "since we are in the ordered phase , there are two possible such conditions , spin fixed up or down . for a given magnetic field on the ( right ) boundary",
    ", the two ( left ) boundary conditions at @xmath132 should correspond to different problems , with presumably different states describing the right boundary .",
    "ghoshal and zamolodchikov in @xcite argue that spin up and @xmath133 correspond to the usual boundary state , while spin down and @xmath133 correspond instead to an `` excited boundary state '' , obtained formally by some procedure of analytic continuation .",
    "we believe that a similar feature holds , the other boundary in our finite geometry playing the role of the boundary condition at @xmath132 in @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the tba approach proposed in @xcite lacks a crucial element , and is good only when , roughly speaking , the boundary couplings would not lead to existence of frustration in the integrable massive bulk theory compatible with the massless boundary perturbations . in the ising case : when the two fields have the same sign .",
    "how to handle the case @xmath134 thus requires some additional ingredient . to see what it may be ,",
    "let us calculate the ground state energy of the ising model on the strip by brute force , diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
    "following calculations initiated in @xcite we have @xmath135 the modes @xmath136 are determined from the quantization equation @xmath137 one can easily show that this equation has only real @xmath136 solutions , and that if @xmath136 is a solution , so is @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the sum in ( [ gschat ] ) runs only over the @xmath139 values .",
    "now a detailed study of the quantization equation shows that all solutions are analytical functions of @xmath101 and @xmath102 _ except _ for one of them , which in particular goes as @xmath140 at small magnetic fields .",
    "manipulations of ( [ gschat ] ) in the usual way lead to the tba integral formula ( [ tbai ] ) .",
    "suppose now that we believe this result for @xmath141 .",
    "to get the result for @xmath104 , we could take the formal expansion of ( [ tbai ] ) in powers of @xmath142 and continue analytically in the variable @xmath120 .",
    "this , it seems from the previous analysis , involves only the modes @xmath143 .",
    "if the mode @xmath144 is included in the sum for @xmath141 , the analytically continued result will be obtained by discarding it , and using instead the mode @xmath145 : in other words , we suggest that the energy for negative @xmath120 simply reads @xmath146 + k_0 ,   \\label{correcttbai}\\ ] ] if @xmath104 , this expression goes as @xmath147 as @xmath148 , in agreement with the conformal prediction for @xmath107 boundary conditions .",
    "two tests are therefore satisfied .",
    "we also observe that ( [ correcttbai ] ) implies the simple result @xmath149 note that the idea of adding an extra contribution in different regimes of couplings appears first in @xcite .    to provide supplementary justification for this construction",
    ", we have performed some numerical checks on equation ( [ gsediff ] ) using mathematica .",
    "the plots were produced using exact diagonalization of a lattice ising model at its bulk critical point , for system sizes up to ten sites , with equal absolute values for the left and right boundary magnetic fields .",
    "both cases @xmath150 and @xmath151 were separately solved , and their difference compared to the root @xmath152 .",
    "figure [ fig : isinggsediff ] shows our results .",
    "difficulties related with the relative values of the two boundary parameters will be generic - and worse - in the case of the double boundary sine - gordon model , and require considerable efforts . on top of this",
    ", an additional difficulty arises due to the presence of the phase @xmath12 : even if the bulk is chosen to be at the reflectionless points and hence have diagonal scattering , the boundary reflections can not be simultaneously diagonalized , requiring substantial modification to the crossed channel tba of @xcite .",
    "we would like to illustrate this in the case of the free fermion point @xmath153 .",
    "at the free fermion point @xmath154 , the ( massive ) sine - gordon theory simplifies considerably .",
    "the only fundamental excitations are two fermions , the soliton and the antisoliton .",
    "their scattering matrix in the bulk is trivial , independent of rapidity - the creation and annihilation operators obey the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath155 with all other anticommutators vanishing , @xmath156 labelling soliton / antisoliton particle types .",
    "scattering at the boundaries is encoded in the @xmath0 matrix @xmath157 there will be one reflection matrix for each boundary , and its elements will depend on the rapidity of the incident particle , as well as the bulk and boundary parameters of the field theory .",

    "we will have to tackle this issue in more details later .",
    "for now , we observe ( as discussed in details in the appendix ) that the point @xmath153 being equivalent to a free fermion theory , explicit calculations can easily be carried out , and one finds @xcite @xmath158 /d_{l , r } ( \\theta ) , \\nonumber \\\\ % p^-_{l , r } ( \\theta ) = [ \\cosh \\theta - \\frac{1}{2 } \\gamma_{l , r } \\cosh(\\theta   % + i\\phi_{l , r } ) ] /d_{l , r } ( \\theta ) \\nonumber \\\\ q^+_{l , r } ( \\theta ) & = & q^-_{l , r } ( \\theta ) = \\frac{i}{2 } \\frac{\\sinh   2\\theta}{d_{l , r}(\\theta ) } ,   \\\\ d_{l , r } ( \\theta ) & = & -i \\gamma_{l , r } \\cosh ( \\frac{\\theta - i   \\phi_{l , r } - i\\pi/2}{2 } )     \\sinh ( \\frac{\\theta + i\\phi_{l , r } + i\\pi/2}{2 } ) - \\cosh^2 \\theta , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .    in the @xmath0-channel description of the problem , the explicit form of the boundary states then reads @xmath161 here , the @xmath162 matrices are given by the analytic continuation of the boundary r - matrix according to@xmath163 as it should , this obeys the boundary cross - unitarity condition @xmath164 , in view of the fact that the scattering matrix is simply @xmath165 .",

    "we therefore note the singularity position as @xmath265 ( note that if @xmath266 is a singularity , so is @xmath267 ) .",

    "note that the relative position of the singularities is dictated by the @xmath382-system .",
    "if such a singularity structure occurs , the first tba equation needs to be modified to take the pole contribution into account : @xmath423 +   \\ln [ 1+y_2 ^ - ( \\kappa ) ] \\right\\ } , \\label{univcorrected}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the function @xmath424 as the residue that pops out of the universal kernel . note",
    "that this modification ensures the presence of a @xmath410 singularity on the real line at @xmath421 , as required .",

    "the ground state energy changes under this continuation : we will treat this after solving the singularity problem of the tba equations .",

    "the tba system now comprises three equations , i.e. the two basic tba equations , with the addition of the first singularity condition .",
    "the first thing to notice is that this modification cures our problems at @xmath372 with the @xmath363 asymptotics .",
    "that is , the relevant formulas become @xmath429 again using the notation @xmath366 , we can rewrite these as @xmath430 providing a smooth curve for @xmath373 ( note the change of sign ) around the singular point .",
    "now as we tune @xmath12 up beyond this , we encounter the possibility of a type @xmath431 singularity , so this is by far not the end of the story . from the asymptotics at @xmath432 , we expect this to happen at @xmath213 , where @xmath368 is bound to change sign ( meaning that the function @xmath433 must become negative on at least part of the real axis of @xmath215 ) .",
    "we therefore expect a @xmath431 singularity at @xmath216 for @xmath213 .",
    "moreover , a careful study of the first singularity condition above shows that one can solve it for @xmath421 real only provided ( here , for @xmath434 ) @xmath435 the immediate consequence of this is that the window of possible values of the first singular point grows between @xmath372 and @xmath217 , but decreases again afterwards .",
    "we therefore expect the first singularity to collapse back to zero before @xmath12 reaches @xmath436 .",

    "a generalization of the ising model argument given in section ii indicates that there always will be a singularity at @xmath458 .",

    "since the ground state is analytic , the first gap behaves as @xmath469 at small magnetic fields , and pinches the ground state in a v shape around the symmetric point @xmath470 .",
    "technically , the existence of singularities in the tba approach follows from the dependence of the scattering matrices on @xmath471 instead of @xmath12 .",

    "we thus expect from this to observe singularities also at values @xmath487 , and multiples ( the pattern is similar but different from the one of excited boundary states discussed in @xcite).more work is required to clarify this question .",
    "the tba approach to the double kondo model is bound to be rather intricate , as the boundary scattering involves now ( except for spin @xmath488 ) boundary degrees of freedom , whose inclusion into the boundary state and the subsequent r - channel tba is not obvious .",

    "the ddv approach to a problem with two boundaries has been discussed in details in @xcite . there , the starting point was the inhomogeneous 6 vertex model with boundary fields .",
    "the role of the inhomogeneities was to introduce a bulk mass scale , while the boundary fields constrained the value of the sine - gordon field on the boundaries .",
    "the net result was an expression for the ground state energy of the sine - gordon model with double dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known how to introduce a different kind of inhomogeneities in the 6 vertex model to get a theory that is massless , with free l movers and r movers interacting with a kondo type impurity .",

    "amounts to fusing the identity ( kac moody ) representation that initially goes through the system with the spin @xmath488 ( kac moody ) representation , so the ground state energy in the ir should correspond to the conformal weight @xmath501 .",
    "this is in agreement with our formula , as the usual dilogarithm analysis gives @xmath502 if however we put two kondo impurities , we see that our formula gives @xmath503 , while fusing with the kac moody twice gives the kac moody identity representation back , with lowest conformal weight @xmath504 .",
    "the @xmath505 weight is instead an excited weight , and therefore our ddv equation , while it captures the ground state at small coupling , captures instead an excited state at large coupling .",
    "it was also argued by affleck and ludwig in @xcite that the picture for @xmath506 essentially carries over to the case of arbitrary @xmath507 : in either case , flow from uv to ir is described by the absorption of an eletron by the impurity , and a phase shift of @xmath217 for the fermion wave function .",

    "we check this expression by comparing the resulting `` current '' in applications to josephson juncionts to the one obtained in @xcite .",

    "as we were completing this paper , a preprint appeared @xcite where the same problem is discussed , and the problem of analytic continuation is also claimed to be solved .",
    "we believe that the solution proposed in @xcite is actually incorrect , for technical reasons we now discuss .    in this preprint ,",
    "the authors claim to find the solutions to the singularity conditions on the imaginary axis of @xmath215 , for any value of @xmath318 .",

    "moreover , the authors of @xcite argue that only one singularity shows up for any value of @xmath318 , whereas we have shown ( using for example of @xmath432 asymptotics and the @xmath382-system arguments ) that two singularities have to be treated for @xmath255 to ensure analyticity in @xmath12 . as an illustration , consider equation ( 3 - 12 ) of @xcite , which is the universal form of the tba corrected for the first singularity .",
    "the result for the correction is the residue @xmath542 , whereas we correct with the residue of the universal scattering kernel ( see our equation ( [ univcorrected ] ) ) .",
    "the reason for the difference seems to be that the authors of @xcite have not taken into account the fact that the function @xmath543 diverges at @xmath216 when @xmath372 , in addition to the first logarithmic kernel involving @xmath413 ( the notations are different : @xmath544 in their work is what we have called @xmath413 here ) .",
    "these two divergences each modify the tba equations , and correcting for only one of them leads to the wrong results .",
    "this is transparent if the whole analytical continuation procedure is done using the universal for the the tba equations from the start , as we have done .",

    "as we do not wish to identify @xmath548 at the points @xmath453 and @xmath0 , in order to accommodate different boundary effects on both sides , this is not flexible enough .",
