    "meson semileptonic decays are very interesting phenomena because the measure of their rates combined with lattice qcd calculations allows us to extract the elements of the ckm matrix .",
    "specifically , in this contribution we present our calculation of the vector form factor of the kaon semileptonic decay at zero 4-momentum transfer , which allows us to extract the value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is possible thanks to the relation between the vector current responsible for the decay and two form factors : @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the definition of the scalar form factor @xmath11 is @xmath12 which implies the relation @xmath13 . by calculating @xmath14 on the lattice and using the experimental result of @xmath6",
    "we can then extract the value of @xmath8 .",
    "we used the ensembles produced by the etm collaboration with @xmath1 using the twisted mass action @xcite , which include in the sea , beside the contribution of two degenerate light quarks , the strange and charm quarks .",
    "our simulation features pion masses ranging from @xmath2 mev to approximately @xmath3 mev and three values of the lattice spacing , the smallest being approximately @xmath4fm .",
    "valence quarks were simulated using the osterwalder - seiler action @xcite , while the gauge fields were implemented using the iwasaki action @xcite . for each lattice spacing we used three values of the bare strange quark mass to allow for a smooth interpolation of our data to the physical value @xmath15 , which we determined in our paper @xcite .",
    "different values of the spatial momenta were simulated using twisted boundary conditions @xcite , allowing us to cover both the spacelike and timelike region of the 4-momentum transfer .",
    "for further details about the simulation the reader should see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we studied a combination of three - points correlation functions in order to extract the form factors @xmath16 and @xmath11 as functions of the 4-momentum transfer @xmath17 , light quark mass @xmath18 and the lattice spacing @xmath19 .",
    "we then performed a chiral and continuum extrapolation in order to obtain the physical value of @xmath14 .",
    "our result is @xmath5 where the uncertainty is both statistical and systematic.this allows us to extract the value of the ckm matrix element @xmath7 , which is compatible with the unitarity constraint of the standard model at the permille level .",
    "our data consists of three point correlation functions connecting moving pions and kaons through a vector current inserted at a time distance @xmath20 from the source and @xmath21 from the sink .",
    "the behaviour of these correlation functions for large @xmath22 allows us to extract the matrix elements of the vector current by studying the following quantity @xmath23 the matrix elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be extracted from the @xmath26 plateaux as @xmath27 thus , we obtain the form factors through the relations @xmath28 and subsequentely calculate @xmath29 from eq.([eq : f0def ] ) .",
    "an example of the extraction of the matrix elements can be seen in fig.([fig : matel ] ) .",
    "meson masses were calculated by isolating the ground state of two points correlation functions of pseudoscalar mesons at rest .",
    "the first step in our analysis was to study the dependence of @xmath16 and @xmath11 on the 4-momentum transfer @xmath17 in order to interpolate our data to @xmath30 .",
    "this was done using the @xmath31 expansion @xcite ( up to @xmath32 ) and the condition @xmath13 is imposed as a constraint .",
    "an example can be seen in fig.([fig : f0fpq2 ] ) .",
    "we also tried to fit the @xmath17 dependence using other fit ansatz ( e.g. polynomial expression in @xmath17 ) , obtaining nearly identical results .",
    "thus , after interpolating our data to the physical value of the strange quark mass using a quadratic spline procedure , we performed the chiral and continuum extrapolation using the following su(2 ) chpt prediction at nlo @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath19 is the lattice spacing and the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are determined by our fit .    in order to estimate the systematic uncertainty induced by the chiral extrapolation we also fitted our data using the su(3 ) chpt ansatz beyond the nlo : @xmath38+\\delta_3a^2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined in our fit .",
    "the full expression for @xmath42 can be found in @xcite . in eq.([eq : su3 ] ) the ademollo gatto theorem @xcite is satisfied in the continuum limit , i.e. in the su(3 ) limit @xmath43 and the deviations from this value are quadratic in @xmath44 . in fig.([fig : f0ml ] ) we show the chiral and continuum extrapolation of our data , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : su2 ] ) and ( [ eq : su3 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the results at the physical point are compatible within the uncertainties .",
    "thus we combined the two results obtaining @xmath45 where @xmath46 indicates the statistical uncertainty which includes the one induced by the fitting procedure and the error induced by the numerical inputs needed for the analysis , namely the values of the light quark mass @xmath18 , the lattice spacing @xmath19 and the su(2 ) chpt low energy constants @xmath11 and @xmath47 , which were determined in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 part of the uncertainty is the one induced by the difference in the results corresponding to the two chiral extrapolations we performed .",
    "it should be noticed that there are two lattice points calculated at the same lattice spacing and light quark mass but different volumes .",
    "they turn out to be well compatible within the uncertainties , allowing us to state that finite size effects can be safely neglected in our analysis .",
    "we then took the experimental value of @xmath49 from @xcite and obtained @xmath50 taking the result for @xmath51 from @xcite we perform the unitarity test @xmath52 where the contribution of @xmath53 is negligible .",
    "as a possible extension of our analysis we performed a multi - combined fit of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 dependencies of the form factors in order to predict them not only at @xmath30 , but on the entire @xmath17 region accessible to experiments , i.e from @xmath30 to @xmath54    we opted for the same strategy used in @xcite , i.e. we performed a global fit using functional forms of the form factors derived by expanding in powers of @xmath55 the nlo su(3 ) chpt predictions for the form factors @xcite . as a constraint we included in the analysis the callan - treiman theorem @xcite , which relates in the su(2 ) chiral limit the scalar form factor calculated at the unphysical @xmath56 to the ratio of the decay constants @xmath57 . a preliminary result for the form factors",
