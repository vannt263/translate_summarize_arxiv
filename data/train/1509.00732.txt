    "although @xmath1cdm cosmological model provides a great match between theory and observation @xcite , what makes it to be usually referred to as the concordance model \" , a number of shortcomings , as the cosmological constant and hierarchy problems , still await for convincing explanations .",
    "while by assuming general relativity as the gravitational theory , those problems can not be solve straightforwardly , higher order derivative and extradimensional theories might contribute efficiently to solve these issues .",
    "note that @xmath2 and @xmath0 cosmological models @xcite - moraes/2015b , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being respectively the ricci scalar and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , are able to describe the cosmic acceleration our universe is undergoing ( check @xcite - perlmutter/1999 ) with no need of invoking a cosmological constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the hierarchy problem can be solved by assuming our observable universe is a sub - manifold which is embedded in an anti - de sitter five - dimensional space ( ads@xmath5 ) , called bulk , as in randall - sundrum braneworld model @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will deal with braneworld models in the presence of scalar fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "departing from the original randall and sundrum proposal , which leads to a thin braneworld scenario , the coupling with scalar fields leads to thick braneworlds .",
    "the presence of a scalar field makes the warp function to behave smoothly , yielding such a thickness .",
    "this possibility has opened a new area of study , and here we quote refs.@xcite-@xcite for some works on the subject .",
    "specifically , we will consider the @xmath0 gravity in such a thick braneworld scenario .",
    "note that although @xmath2 brane models have already been presented in the literature @xcite-@xcite , due to its recent elaboration , @xmath0 gravity still lacks of a significant number of applications in the braneworld .",
    "anyhow , it is remarkable the fact that in @xcite , the authors have pioneered such an approach .    here , rather than a cosmological approach",
    ", we will investigate @xmath0 brane models from the configurational entropy ( ce ) perspective .",
    "gleiser and stamatopoulos ( gs ) have proposed in @xcite such a new physical quantity , which brings additional informations about some parameters of a given model for which the energy density is localized .",
    "they have shown that the higher the energy that approximates the actual solution , the higher its relative ce , which is defined as the absolute difference between the actual function ce and the trial function ce .",
    "the ce is able to solve situations where the energies of the configurations are degenerate . in this case",
    ", it can be used to select the best system configuration .",
    "although it has been recently proposed , the ce has already been used to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking prdgleiser - stamatopoulos , to obtain the stability bound for compact objects @xcite , to investigate the emergence of localized objects during inflationary preheating @xcite and to distinguish configurations with energy - degenerate spatial profiles rafael - dutra - gleiser .",
    "solitons , lorentz symmetry breaking , supersymmetry , and entropy , were employed using the ce concept @xcite .",
    "the ce for travelling solitons reveals that the best value of the parameter responsible for breaking the lorentz symmetry is that where the energy density is distributed equally around the origin .",
    "it was argued that the information - theoretical measure of travelling solitons in lorentz symmetry violation scenarios can be very important to probe situations where the parameters responsible for breaking the symmetries are arbitrary , with the ce selecting the best value of the parameter in the model .",
    "another interesting work about ce was presented in @xcite , where it is responsible for identifying the critical point in the context of continuous phase transitions .",
    "finally , in braneworld scenarios it was shown that ce can be employed to demonstrate a high organizational degree in the structure of the system configuration for large values of a parameter of the sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "the entropic information - measure in the context of @xmath2 braneworlds with non - constant curvature has also been studied @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the ce in @xmath0 brane models .",
    "we obtain its profile and reveal the information content of such models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will review the concept of ce measure . in section iii ,",
    "we outline the basic theoretical structure for generalized @xmath0 theories of gravity . in section iv , we show two distinct models in @xmath0 theory and its solutions . in section",
    "v , we describe the calculations of the ce for @xmath0 theories .",
    "we also show the corresponding ce profile . finally , in section",
    "vi , we present our conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "here , we will review the very recent work by gs @xcite , where it was shown that , in analogy with shannon s information entropy , a ce measure in a functional space can be used to select the best fit solution with spatially - localized energy .",
    "another interesting consequence highlighted by gs is the fact that the ce relates the dynamical and informational content of physical models . in this case",
    ", this information - theoretical measure can be able to extract information about the different solutions which is related to their spatial profiles .",
    "thus , following gleiser - stamatopoulos , let us begin by writing the ce as    @xmath6=-\\int d^{d}\\mathbf{\\omega } \\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{\\omega } ) \\ln [ \\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{\\omega } ) ] ,   \\label{19}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the number of spatial dimensions , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the maximal modal fraction , that is , the mode giving the highest contribution . in this case ,",
    "the function @xmath10 which was defined as the modal fraction is represented as    @xmath11    the function @xmath12 represents the fourier transform of the energy density of the configuration .",
    "it is important to remark that the energy density must be square - integrable since in such cases the entropy can be well defined .",
    "we will extend the procedure presented in @xcite , which is absolutely general when applied to systems with spatially - localized energy for a scalar field theory that describes generalized gravity coupled to a scalar field in five - dimensional space - time . following that work , it is possible to obtain the entropy of the configurations assuming that @xmath13 obeys the fourier transform :    @xmath14    we are working with spatially - localized energy densities , which are part of a set of square - integrable bounded functions @xmath15 and their fourier transforms @xmath13 .",
    "it is also important to remark that the plancherel s theorem states that @xmath16    as argued by gs , the information - entropic measure approach can be capable of taking into account the dynamical and the informational contents of models with localized energy configurations . in this case",
    ", the ce provides a complementary perspective to situations where strictly energy - based arguments are inconclusive .",
    "in fact , as pointed out in gleiser - stamatopoulos , higher ce correlates with higher energy , and consequently the configuration is more disordered .",
    "therefore , the information - theoretical measure is responsible to point out which solution is the most ordered one among a family of infinite solutions .",
    "thus , we will apply this new approach to investigate generalized gravity theories coupled to a real scalar field .",
    "as we will see , important consequences will arise from the ce concept .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the ce provides a stricter bound on the parameters of the @xmath0 models .",
    "in this section , we present a brief review about @xmath0 theories of gravity . in this context",
    ", it was presented some years ago by harko and collaborators the seminal work entitled @xmath0 gravity @xcite . in that context",
    "the authors showed that it is possible to construct a modified theory of gravity , where the gravitational lagrangian is given by an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath3 and of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 . on a physical viewpoint",
    ", the dependence on @xmath4 may be originated by the presence of exotic imperfect fluids or quantum effects .",
    "therefore , as shown in @xcite , in @xmath17 dimensions the action @xmath18 for the @xmath0 modified theories of gravity can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath0 is the arbitrary function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath20 is the determinant of the metric @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 assuming the values @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 , and",
    "@xmath28 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "note that we are using the natural system of units with @xmath29 , so that the einstein gravitational constant is defined as @xmath30 .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath0 modified theory of gravity has been analysed in the literature in several scenarios .",
    "for instance , we can find studies in cosmological models @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , in quantum chromo dynamics @xcite , in a bianchi type - ii string with magnetic field @xcite and in thermodynamics @xcite .    on the other hand , recently",
    ", bazeia and collaborators , motivated by the works @xcite , have found thick brane models in @xmath0 generalized theories of gravity in an @xmath31 warped geometry with an extra dimension of infinite extent @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that two distinct choices of the functional form of @xmath0 induce quantitative modifications in the thick brane profile , without changing its qualitative behavior .",
    "another interesting result obtained in bazeia/2015 is the fact that the gravity sector remains linearly stable in each choice of @xmath0 analized .",
    "the theory used by bazeia and collaborators for describing generalized gravity coupled to a scalar field in five - dimensional space - time , with an extra dimension @xmath32 of infinite extent , is given by the following action @xmath33 , \\label{eq1}\\]]where @xmath34 is the lagrange density , @xmath35 , with the indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 running from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , the signature of the metric is @xmath40 and we are using units such that @xmath41 . in this case , the lagrangian density is put into the form @xmath42    from the equation above , the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field in this theory is given by @xmath43    in addition , the corresponding equation of motion for the scalar field and the modified einstein equation can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .     following the approach presented in @xcite",
    ", we will work with the metric @xmath48    where @xmath32 is the extra dimension , @xmath49 is the usual minkowski metric in the four - dimensional spacetime with signature @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the so - called warp factor . in particular , when the warp function @xmath52 and the field @xmath53 are static and depend only on the extra dimension @xmath32 , the equation of motion and the modified einstein equations become @xmath54\\phi ^{\\prime } = \\big(1+\\frac{5}{4}f_{t}\\big ) v_{\\phi } \\",
    ", ,   \\label{eq8}\\ ] ]    [ eq9 ] @xmath55    where the prime denote derivatives with respect to the extra dimension .    here",
    ", it is important to highlight that this particular approach , where we are considering the static case with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , makes possible the finding of innovative analytical solutions for the theory . a good example are the interesting solutions found in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "two distinct models for @xmath0 theories of gravity have been studied , and it was shown that the gravity sector of the thick braneworld configurations remains linearly stable . moreover",
    ", each model induces new quantitative modifications in the thick brane profile .",
    "thus , in order to make the present work more comprehensive and didactical , in the next section we will present those two examples and their solutions .",
    "in the present section , we consider two particular classes of @xmath0 modified gravity models , which were investigated in @xcite . in that reference",
    ", it has been found that in such particular cases , both the field @xmath53 and warp function @xmath52 can be obtained analytically .      in the first case ,",
    "the @xmath0 function is given by    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are real parameters .",
    "in this case , when @xmath62 the exact solutions presented in @xcite for the field @xmath53 and the warp function @xmath52 are written as    @xmath63\\ , ,   \\label{eq33 } \\\\",
