    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction still remains one of the central problems of the nuclear structure theory .",
    "it seems natural to use the free - space forces , but the most of the nuclear structure theorists prefer the effective ones instead .",
    "the basic motivations are as follows .",
    "\\(a ) historically the first one arose from the wide - spread belief in sixties that the free - space @xmath0 potential has a hard repulsive core .",
    "clearly such interaction does not apply directly because of the divergence of finite - order feynman diagrams . the most popular way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to calculate the brueckner @xmath1-matrix and use it as the effective interaction in the hartree - fock problem .",
    "this is the hartree ",
    "fock  brueckner approximation , see @xcite and the references therein for details .",
    "but soon it became clear that the description of the two - nucleon system , i.e. the deuteron properties and the elastic @xmath0 scattering phase shifts below the pion production threshold , does not require the hard repulsive core .",
    "as a result all the contemporary @xmath0 potentials are of soft core character , and so the above difficulty does not really exist .",
    "in such conditions the calculation of the brueckner @xmath1-matrix is not compulsory .",
    "\\(b ) the renormalization of the free - space interaction due to the medium polarization effects . but",
    "such effects are treated by conventional methods of quantum many - body theory , and therefore the above reason is not the argument for the effective forces .",
    "\\(c ) the medium qcd - renormalization due to the fact that the quark composition of the qcd vacuum is changed in nuclear medium thus leading to the changes of both the mesons and the meson ",
    "nucleon vertices @xcite@xcite .",
    "such processes can hardly be described in all details since the exact theory does not yet exist for the nonperturbative region .",
    "nevertheless , at least one exact statement can be done .",
    "the qcd - renormalized interaction is the functional of nuclear density possessing the following obvious property : it turns into the free - space one in the zero - density limit . for this reason",
    "it can be represented as the following functional expansion : @xmath2 in this way we conclude that the medium qcd - renormalization is equivalent to the existence of many - particle @xmath0 forces in addition to the two - particle ones .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the physics of strong interaction is essentially nonlinear .",
    "but the nonlinearity automatically leads to many - particle forces .",
    "the above reasons are grounds for our starting point : both the two - particle and many - particle @xmath0 forces must be taken into account for the treatment of nuclear structure .    the three - particle @xmath0 forces are indeed included for the calculations of few - nucleon systems @xcite .",
    "but the following questions arises : is this sufficient for complex nuclei  ?",
    "this point as well as a number of those concerning the nuclear structure might be elucidated if the model - independent object would exist in nuclei .",
    "our approach is based on the fact that such objects do really exist . as discussed in our previous work",
    "@xcite they are the doorway states for one - nucleon transfer reaction .",
    "we showed that    \\(i ) at least the three - particle repulsion and the four - particle attraction must be taken into account in addition to the two - particle forces ;    \\(ii ) the nuclear relativity is really existing phenomenon rather than the hypothesis of j.d .  walecka @xcite ;    \\(iii ) the dominant contribution to the isovector nuclear potential is provided by the many - particle forces ;    \\(iv ) the observed spectra of the doorway states can be used to specify the neutron density distributions in nuclei ; such specified densities are indeed obtained for the closed - shell nuclei @xmath3ca , @xmath4zr and @xmath5pb .    in the present work",
    "our approach is applied to the `` empirical '' studies of nuclear correlation effects owing to which the nuclear wave functions are different from the slater determinants .",
    "such effects are treated by a variety of approximate methods since the exact ones do not exist .",
    "for this reason it is very important to get a model - independent quantitative information about the above effects .",
    "the possibility provided by our approach is based on the fact that the single - particle states of nucleon in nuclear static field ( which are just the doorway states for one - nucleon transfer reactions @xcite ) are correlation - free objects in contrast to the landau ",
    "migdal quasiparticles @xcite ( which include the correlations by definition ) and single - particle states in nuclear hartree  fock calculations with effective forces ( where the correlations are implicitly included in the phenomenological effective force parameters )",
    "so , calculating the correlation - free quantities and comparing them with the observed ones we get a quantitative measure of the correlation effects . in sect.2",
    "this procedure is applied to the nucleon density distributions whereas the problems concerning the nuclear binding energy are discussed in sect.3 .",
    "the nucleon density distribution in the ground state of nucleus @xmath6 is ( see @xcite for the notations ) @xmath7 the integration contour @xmath8 includes the real axis and the infinite radius semicircle in the upper part of the complex @xmath9 plane .",
    "as seen from eq.(1 ) the density is expressed through the single - particle amplitudes of the @xmath10 nuclear states .",
    "expanding them over the complete set of the doorway states , @xmath11 and putting eq.(3 ) into eq.(2 ) we get @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( actually the coefficients @xmath14 are real quantities if the parity violation due to weak interaction is disregarded ) .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath15 are the doorway state occupation numbers .",
    "indeed , the particle number is @xmath16 since the nondiagonal elements do not contribute because of the orthogonality between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 obey the following limitations : @xmath21 the first follows from the fact that the doorway states are distributed over the actual ones of both the @xmath10 and @xmath22 nuclei , see eq.(13c ) in ref.@xcite , whereas the second is a consequence of the cauchy  bunjakowsky inequality .    the facts @xmath23 and @xmath24 reflect the fermi surface smearing due to the correlation effects .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 carrying the quantitative information about these effects can be found `` empirically '' by considering the relation ( 4 ) together with the limitations ( 7 ) as equations for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the results will be published elsewhere .    as a result of the correlations a part of nucleons is out of the nuclear fermi - surface .",
    "the number @xmath25 of such nucleons is calculated by comparing the observed density distribution with the correlation - free one @xmath26 @xmath27 is the fermi level energy .",
    "such comparison is shown in fig.1 for the proton density distribution in @xmath3ca . as seen from the figure the correlation - free density contains more nucleons in the inner region @xmath28 than the observed one",
    ", @xmath29 is the intersection point .",
    "the situation in the outer region @xmath30 is clearly opposite since both densities correspond to the same number of nucleons .",
    "the number of redistributed nucleons is @xmath31r^2dr\\ = \\ 4\\pi\\int\\limits^\\infty_{r_i}[\\rho(r)-\\rho_{cf}(\\rho)]r^2dr\\ .\\ ] ] @xmath29 is the intersection point : @xmath32 .",
    "this is just the @xmath25 because the only reason for the redistribution is the fermi - surface smearing due to the correlations .       as follows from the table the convergence of this sequence",
    "is not seen .",
    "this observation suggests the possible existence of the contributions from higher many - particle forces , and therefore the whole sequence should be summed up .",
    "but this can be done only within some reasonable model for the many - particle forces including all higher - order ones as well as the finite range and the mechanism for the saturation of nuclear density .",
    "the corresponding investigation is in progress ."
