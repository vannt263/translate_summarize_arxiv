    "if @xmath6 is not @xmath7-injective , dehn s lemma ( see @xcite , chapter  4 ) implies that @xmath6 can be compressed , reducing @xmath8 . by the hypothesis that @xmath4 is aspherical , after finitely many compressions , one obtains a @xmath7-injective surface representing the given homology class .",
    "for more general classes of groups , no tool remotely resembling dehn s lemma exists . nevertheless one can consider the following strategy .",
    "let @xmath9 be a @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 be a rational homology class in @xmath12 .",
    "suppose one can find a map of a closed surface @xmath13 with no spherical components , representing @xmath14 in @xmath15 for some integer @xmath16 , which realizes the infimum of @xmath17 over all surfaces and all integers @xmath18 .",

    "then @xmath24 could be compressed along @xmath23 , producing a new surface @xmath25 representing @xmath26 in homology , and satisfying @xmath27 , contrary to hypothesis .",

    "thurston norm in a given projective homology class , it is injective .",
    "it is therefore an intriguing question to understand for which groups @xmath0 and which homology classes in @xmath1 one can find maps of surfaces ( projectively ) realizing the gromov  thurston norm . in this paper we show that if @xmath0 is a group obtained as a graph of free groups amalgamated along cyclic subgroups , and @xmath28 is a homology class with nonzero gromov ",
    "thurston norm , then some map of a surface to a @xmath10 realizes the gromov ",

    "norm , introduced in @xcite , and studied in free groups in @xcite . a consequence of the main theorem of @xcite is that extremal surfaces for the stable commutator norm exist in every rational relative homology class in a free group .",
    "these extremal surfaces can be glued together to produce extremal ( closed ) surface subgroups in @xmath0 .",
    "a more careful analysis reveals that the gromov ",
