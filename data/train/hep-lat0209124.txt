    "calculation of scattering phase shift is an important step for expanding our understanding of strong interactions based on lattice qcd beyond the hadron mass spectrum . for scattering lengths , which are the threshold values of phase shifts , several studies have already been carried out . for the simplest case of the two - pion system",
    ", the @xmath0 scattering length has been calculated in detail @xcite including the continuum extrapolation @xcite .",
    "there is also a pioneering attempt at the @xmath7 scattering length  @xcite , which is much more difficult due to the presence of box and disconnected contributions . for the scattering phase shift , in contrast",
    ", there has been only one calculation for @xmath0 by fiebig _",
    "et.al._ , who used lattice simulations to estimate the effective two - pion potential and used it to calculate the phase shift in a quantum mechanical treatment  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0 @xmath1-wave two - pion scattering phase shift applying the lscher s finite size method  @xcite .",
    "technically the key feature is the extraction of the two - pion energy eigenvalues from the pion @xmath8-point function .",
    "this is successfully solved by a diagonalization method proposed by lscher and wolff  @xcite for @xmath9 non - linear @xmath10 model in @xmath11-dimensions .",
    "we also extract the scattering length from the phase shift data , and compare it with previous calculations .",
    "we work in quenched lattice qcd employing the standard plaquette action for gluons and the wilson fermion action for quarks .",
    "we wish to mention that the study of the two - pion scattering phase shift also has important impact on the calculation of the @xmath12 decay amplitudes",
    ". a direct calculation of the amplitude from the @xmath8-point function @xmath13 is very difficult , as pointed out by maiani and testa  @xcite , because the 4-point function at large times is dominated by the two - pion ground state with zero relative momenta , which differs from the final state of the decay having a non - zero relative momentum .",
    "an exception is the amplitude from the @xmath14 meson to the two - pion ground state itself , because this can be calculated by taking the two - pion state with zero relative momentum in the final state .",
    "however , the amplitude thus obtained is unphysical , and a reconstruction of the physical amplitude using some effective theory of qcd , for example chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , is needed .",
    "using such an effective theory causes large uncertainties in the lattice prediction of the decay amplitude .",
    "hence , a method for direct calculation of the @xmath12 decay amplitude has been strongly desired .",
    "recently lellouch and lscher  @xcite obtained a relation between the lattice and the physical amplitude in the two - pion center of mass system with the energy @xmath15 . in their derivation no effective theory is used .",
    "_  @xcite derived the relation from a different approach , and extended it to the general two - pion system with the energy @xmath16 .",
    "they also investigated the limitation of the relation .    in order to apply the relation to obtain the physical decay amplitude",
    ", one has to calculate the amplitude from @xmath14 meson to the two - pion energy eigenstate with non - zero momenta on the lattice .",
    "this is the same problem as one encounters in the calculation of phase shifts using the lscher s method .",
