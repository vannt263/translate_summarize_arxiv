    "several types of nonintersecting o(@xmath0 ) loop models can be obtained as a result of an exact transformation of certain o(@xmath0)-symmetric spin models @xcite .",
    "most of these models are two - dimensional , but the transformation is also applicable in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "it provides a generalization of the o(@xmath0 ) model to non - integer , and even negative values of @xmath0 .",
    "whereas most existing work is restricted to nonintersecting loop models , the models can readily be generalized to include cubic vertices @xcite and crossing bonds @xcite .",
    "these cubic vertices connect to four incoming loop segments , and arise naturally when the o(@xmath0 ) symmetry of the original spin model is broken by interactions of a cubic symmetry @xcite .",
    "the crossing - bond vertices occur in the loop representation of non - planar o(@xmath0)-symmetric spin models .",
    "the presently investigated model is defined in terms of these three types of vertices on the square lattice .",
    "the three types , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ vert ] together with their vertex weights , specify a complete covering of the lattice edges . in comparison with a recent investigation @xcite of crossover phenomena in a densely packed phase of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model , the present set of vertices",
    "is obtained by excluding those that do not cover all lattice edges .",
    "due to the absence of empty edges , the physical interpretation in terms of an o(@xmath0 ) spin model is more remote . a formal mapping of the loop model on the spin model leads to a spin - spin interaction energy that can assume complex values when the relative weight of empty edges becomes sufficiently small .",
    "however , the mapping of the completely packed o(@xmath0 ) loop model on a dilute o(@xmath3 ) loop model model ( which was , as far as we know , first formulated by nienhuis ; see ref .  ) brings it again closer to the realm of the spin models .    a configuration of the vertices of fig .",
    "[ vert ] forms a so - called eulerian graph , which is a graph in which only even numbers of loop segments can be connected at each vertex .",
    "we denote such graphs as @xmath4 .",
    "the present model may thus be called a completely packed eulerian graph model .",
    "the partition sum of this model is defined by @xmath5 where the sum on @xmath4 is on all possible combinations of vertices .",
    "the exponents @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the numbers of vertices of types @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , and @xmath12 denotes the number of components of the graph @xmath4 .",
    "a component is a subset of edges connected by a percolating path of bonds formed by the vertices of @xmath4 . since @xmath13 is a homogeneous function of the vertex weights , one may , without loss of generality , scale out one of the weights .",
    "we thus normalize the weight @xmath9 of the o(@xmath0 ) vertex describing colliding loop segments to 1 .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to comment on our nomenclature . by `` nonintersecting loops '' we mean configurations consisting of the type-@xmath9 vertices in fig .",
    "[ vert ] . since the word `` intersecting '' could be associated with the type-@xmath11 vertices as well as the type-@xmath10 vertices in fig .",
    "[ vert ] , we refer to type-@xmath11 vertices as crossing bonds , and to type-@xmath10 vertices as cubic vertices .",
    "thus we may , alternatively , call this model a completely packed loop model with crossing bonds and cubic vertices , or just a generalized loop model .",
    "furthermore we note that the name `` fully packed '' is used for models in which all vertices are visited , but not all edges are covered by loop segments @xcite .",
    "the present work was inspired by a number of existing exact solutions , in particular of a `` coloring model '' by schultz @xcite , later studied in more detail by perk and schultz @xcite and others @xcite , see also fateev @xcite . in the perk - schultz model ,",
    "the edges of the square lattice receive one out of several colors , in such a way that , for any given color , an even number of edges connects to each vertex .",
    "exact solution were found for several different branches of critical lines that are parametrized by the number of colors .",

    "it simply means that every new bond decreases @xmath12 by one , unless the end points of that bond were already connected .",
    "application of this theorem to the present model requires some care because it merges the degrees of freedom of the cubic model with those of the o(@xmath0 ) model . whereas the spins of the cubic model @xcite are defined on the vertices of the square lattice , the spins of the square - lattice o(@xmath0 ) model @xcite are placed in the middle of the edges . here",

    ", one obtains the conformal anomaly as @xmath148      as far as we are aware , no exact results are available for the universal parameters of branch 2 and 3 and equivalent models .",
    "however , as mentioned in the preceding subsubsection , the cubic perturbation , i.e. the vertex weight @xmath10 , is expected to introduce new universal behavior for branch 2 and 3 with respect to branch 1 .",
    "numerical results @xcite for the dense phase ( not completely packed ) of the model with @xmath9- and @xmath10-type vertices confirm this , and show the existence of a phase with a small value of the magnetic dimension @xmath149 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a phase in which magnetic correlations persist over long distances .",
    "the same coulomb gas result applies to the introduction of crossing bonds , which is , like the cubic perturbation , also described by the four - leg watermelon diagram , and one may thus expect new universal behavior for branch 4 .",
    "a few results are available for a supersymmetric spin chain @xcite related to branch 4 , referred to as the brauer model @xcite .",
    "numerical as well as analytical arguments support , for @xmath150 , the formula for the conformal anomaly @xmath151 and the magnetic dimension @xmath149 is reported to be very small , suggesting anomalously slow decay of magnetic correlations , at least for @xmath152 .",
    "this behavior was confirmed , although with limited accuracy , for a densely packed o(@xmath0 ) model with crossing bonds , which is believed to display similar universal behavior as branch 4 @xcite .",
    "this model was also studied by jacobsen _",
    "@xcite , and recently , correlation functions were obtained by nahum _",
    "@xcite for @xmath84 , decaying as an inverse power of the logarithm of the distance .",
    "as far as universal behavior is concerned , these findings for the completely packed model apply as well in the dense o(@xmath0 ) phase , but not for the o(@xmath0 ) transition to the high - temperature phase , where the cubic perturbation is irrelevant for @xmath153 .",
    "the latter point was numerically confirmed for the @xmath154 @xcite case which describes intersecting trails .",
    "consider a square lattice model , wrapped on the surface of a cylinder with a circumference of @xmath155 lattice units .",
    "the transfer - matrix method is used for the calculation of the partition sum @xmath156 of such systems .",
    "the cylinder may be infinitely long but its circumference @xmath155 is finite .",
    "we postpone the transfer - matrix construction to appendix  [ tmtechnique ] . in this section ,",
    "we focus instead on the calculation of the free energy and the universal quantities .      using techniques described in appendix  [ tmtechnique ] and in ref .",
    ", we have computed a few of the leading eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath157 for some relevant parameter choices .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to eigenstates that are invariant under rotations about the axis of the cylinder , and inversions .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ z - recursion ] ) that , in general , the reduced free energy density for @xmath158 is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath159 as @xmath160 the transfer - matrix results for @xmath161 can be used to estimate the conformal anomaly @xmath146 using the relation @xcite @xmath162 the subdominant eigenvalues @xmath163 of @xmath157 determine the correlation lengths @xmath164 belonging to the @xmath165-th correlation function .",
    "the gap with respect to the largest eigenvalue determines the corresponding correlation length along the cylinder as @xmath166 where it is usual to associate the label @xmath167 with the magnetic correlation length @xmath168 and @xmath169 with the energy - energy correlation length @xmath170 . for the purpose of numerical analysis",
    ", it is convenient to define the corresponding scaled gaps @xmath171 as @xmath172 in the presence of a temperature field @xmath173 and an irrelevant field @xmath92 , its scaling behavior is @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the scaling dimension of the observable whose correlation length is described by @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "this formula provides a basis to observe the phase behavior as a function of a parameter , such as a vertex weight , that contributes to @xmath173 .",
    "if @xmath176 and @xmath92 not too large , a set of curves displaying @xmath171 versus that parameter for several values of the system size @xmath155 will show intersections converging to the point where the relevant scaling field @xmath173 vanishes , i.e. , the point where a phase transition occurs .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ xisce ] ) , the slopes of the @xmath171 curves at the intersections increase with @xmath155 if @xmath176 . in the data analysis",
    ", we shall make use of this criterion for the relevance of the scaling field @xmath173 .    while the calculation of the temperature - like scaling dimension @xmath177 from @xmath178 is straightforward , that of the magnetic dimension @xmath149 needs some further comments .",
    "magnetic correlations between o(@xmath0 ) spins are , in the equivalent o(@xmath0 ) loop model , represented by the insertion of a single loop segment between these two points . in the present context of completely packed models ,",
    "it is not possible to add another loop segment into the system , and we use a method employed e.g. , in ref .  .",
    "it analyzes the difference between the leading eigenvalues of systems with odd system size @xmath155 containing such a segment , and even systems without such a segment .",
    "thus , one may define scaled gaps using the average of two consecutive even ( or odd ) systems as @xmath179\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm or } \\label{x_h}\\\\ x_{h}({\\rm odd}\\;l)&= & \\frac{l}{2\\pi } \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\ln{|\\lambda_0(l-1)|}+ \\ln{|\\lambda_0(l+1)|}\\right)-\\ln{\\lambda_1(l)}\\right]\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath180 denotes the largest eigenvalue of odd systems in the transfer - matrix sector that includes odd connectivities .",
    "this section presents the finite - size analysis of the transfer - matrix results for the free energy of the seven branches following from the schultz solutions @xcite , after transformation of the coloring model into that of eq .",
    "( [ zsql ] ) and ( [ zsqll ] ) .",
    "the vertex weights for these seven branches are listed in table [ branches ] .",
    "part of the numerical results for branch 1 has already appeared in ref .  , together with an analytic derivation of the free energy for @xmath77 .",
    "here we summarize those results , and provide some additional data .",
    "the finite - size data for the free energy were extrapolated using eq .",
    "( [ fcp ] ) , thus yielding estimates of @xmath181 , which are listed in table [ fren ] . for @xmath182 , the finite - size data for the free energy did not obey eq .",
    "( [ fcp ] ) , but were , up to numerical precision , precisely proportional to @xmath183 .",
    "accordingly we quote the results @xmath184 and , for the conformal anomaly , @xmath185 . for most values of @xmath0 , these free energies agree satisfactorily with the theoretical values given in eqs .",
    "( [ fgt2 ] ) to ( [ fltm2 ] ) .",
    "next , the free energies in eq .",
    "( [ fcp ] ) were fixed at their theoretical values , in order to obtain improved estimates of the conformal anomaly .",
    "these results are also listed in table [ fren ] , and appear to agree well with the theoretical values , except for the ranges where @xmath186 slightly exceeds 2 , and where poor finite - size convergence occurs .",
    ".fit results for the free energy density and the conformal anomaly of the branch 1 model , compared with the theoretical values .",
    "estimated numerical uncertainties in the last decimal place are given between parentheses .",
