    "numerically , we can solve ( 8) directly . in all our simulations , the initial ensemble of magnetizations",
    "was taken to be boltzmann - distributed along the anti - parallel orientation .",
    "we assume that the energy barrier height is so large that , before current effects are activated , thermalization has only been achieved within the antiparallel energy well and no states have had time to thermally switch to the parallel orientation on their own .",
    "a typical histogram of magnetic orientations at a given time is shown in figure 1 .",
    "after letting the magnetic system relax to thermal equilibrium ( @xmath67 natural time units ) .",

    "as expected , the data scales linearly.,width=384 ]    we now turn on a current and allow the system to evolve for a fixed amount of time .",
    "once this time has passed , we use the projection rule expressed above to evaluate what fraction of the ensemble has effectively switched from the anti - parallel to the parallel state .",
    "having derived the necessary expressions for our macrospin model dynamics , it is useful to consider the following simplification . let us take the uniaxial anisotropy and spin - current axes to be collinear , namely , @xmath69 . in such a scenario ,",
    "the stochastic llg equation simplifies significantly .",
    "in particular , ( 11 ) reduces to the simplified form :    @xmath70    in this symmetric scenario , @xmath71 coincides with @xmath65 and magnetization reversal has been reduced to a straightforward 1-d problem . for a general value of @xmath72 , the evolution of @xmath71 has two local minima and a saddle .",
    "the two stable configurations are at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while the saddle is located at @xmath75 . for currents",
    "@xmath76 there is only one stable minimum . above critical current",

    ", thermal effects increasingly contribute .",
    "moreover , diffusion gradients add to the deterministic drift , which can be shown explicitly by writing ( 13 ) in its equivalent to form .",
    "doing so leads us to a first correction of the ballistic dynamics due to thermal influences .",
    "the z - component behavior then reads :    @xmath87    the first term on the right hand side is still the ballistic flow that we have just discussed .",
    "the second term is the desired diffusion - gradient drift term .",
    "the contribution of such a term generates a net motion away from the stable minima of the ballistic equations as one expects to see under the influence of thermal effects .",
    "again , we can solve the drift dominated flow analytically to compute the switching time . considering diffusion - gradient drift ,",

    "both expressions coincide in the limit of high currents .    ) where @xmath93 stands for tesla : real time is obtained upon division by @xmath34.,width=384 ]",
    "in the high current regime ( @xmath77 ) , where @xmath94 ( i.e. the uniaxial tilt is aligned with the z - axis ) , the ballistic equation for @xmath65 was shown to decouple from the other components , and the dynamics became one dimensional and deterministic .",
    "for the more general case where the uniaxial anisotropy axis may have any tilt with respect to the z - axis , such a critical current is not as intuitively defined . unlike the collinear limit , a critical current , above which all magnetic states perceive a net flow towards an increasing projection , does not exist .",
    "one can plot @xmath95 over the unit sphere to see what regions allow for an increasing and decreasing projection as the current is changed .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure 3 .",
    ": green @xmath96 , red @xmath97 for applied current @xmath98 .",
    "the plane dissecting the sphere is perpendicular to the uniaxial anistropy axis .",
    "its intersection with the sphere selects the regions with highest uniaxial anisotropy energy.,width=384 ]    unfortunately , regions characterizing negative projection flow can be shown to persist at all currents .",
    "the approach is refined by requiring that on average , over constant - energy precessional trajectories , the flow is toward the positive uniaxial anisotropy axis : @xmath99 .",
    "such trajectories are found by solving the flow equations with @xmath100 .",
    "solutions correspond to circular libations about the uniaxial anisotropy axis .",
    "the critical current is then redefined to be the minimum current at which the average projectional flow is positive at all possible precessional energies .",

    "in fact , in the presence of tilt , precessional trajectories might allow for a magnetization state to temporarily transit through a @xmath102 ,  switched \" configuration , even though it might spend the majority of its orbit in a @xmath103 ,  unswitched \" configuration .",
    "this allows for a much richer mean switching time behavior , especially above critical current , as shown in figure 4 and discussed more in depth later .    .",

    "times are shown in units of ( @xmath107 ) where @xmath93 stands for tesla : real time is obtained upon division by @xmath34.,width=384 ]",
    "for currents @xmath108 the switching relies on thermal effects to stochastically push the magnetization from one energy minimum to the other .",
    "it is of interest to understand how switching probabilities and switching times depend on temperature and applied current .",
    "this is easily done in stochastic systems with gradient flow . in such cases",
    "an energy landscape exists and a steady state probability distribution can be constructed to be used via kramer s theory in deriving approximate low - noise switcing probabilities .    unfortunately , though , spin - torque effects introduce a non - gradient term , and the resulting llg equation does not admit an energy landscape in the presence of applied current . the collinear simplification , however , is an exception . as already described , in the absence of uniaxial tilt the dynamics become effectively one dimensional since the @xmath65 component decouples from the other magnetization components .",
    "consider then ( 13 ) : because it is decoupled from the other degrees of freedom , we can construct a corresponding one - component focker - planck equation .",
    "the evolution in time of the distribution of @xmath71 is then :    @xmath109(q , t),\\nonumber\\ ] ]    where    @xmath110=-\\alpha\\partial_q \\left[(q+i)(1-q^2)-\\frac{1}{2\\xi}(1-q^2)\\partial_q\\right]f.\\nonumber\\ ] ]    for high energy barriers and low currents , the switching events from one basin to the other are expected to be rare .",
    "the probability of a double reversal should be even smaller .",
    "we therefore model the magnetization reversal as a mean first passage time ( mfpt ) problem with absorbing boundaries at the saddle point .",
    "the mfpt will then be given by  @xcite the solution of the adjoint equation ( @xmath111 ) :    @xmath112\\partial_q\\tau(q)=-1\\nonumber\\ ] ]    subject to the boundary condition @xmath113 .",

    "the red curve fits the numerical data asymptotically better the green curve.,width=384 ]    all that remains is to consider the effects of angular tilt on the switching properties in the thermally activated regime .",
    "insight into this problem can be obtained by invoking ( 12 ) again . for small values of @xmath123 ,",
    "the term in square brackets is of leading order over the second ballistic term depending on @xmath66 .",
    "this allows us , in the small @xmath123 regime , to neglect the second ballistic term altogether .",
    "we now concentrate on the behavior of the term in square brackets . for low sub - critial currents , switching will depend on thermal activation for the most part .",
    "we expect an initially anti - parallel configuration to not diffuse very far away from its local energy minima .",
    "we expect it to remain that way until a strong enough thermal kick manages to drive it across the energy barrier . because of this , the second term appearing in the square brackets will generally be close to zero as the particle awaits thermal switching . to make the statement more precise",
    ", one can imagine the magnetic state precessing many times before actually making it over the saddle .",
    "the second term can then be averaged over a constant energy trajectory and shown to vanish identically .",
    "hence , in the subcritical regime , ( 12 ) can be rewritten in the following approximate form :    @xmath124    this , is reminiscent of the 1d projectional dynamics discussed in relation to the collinear limit , and shown explicitly in ( 13 ) .",
    "the only difference between the two is the substitution @xmath125 ; recall because @xmath126 , @xmath127 . in other words , the thermally activated dynamics are the same for all angular separations up to a rescaling by the critical current .",
    "we then expect that the mean switching time dependences remain functionally identical to the collinear case for all uniaxial tilts .",
    "we have confirmed this by comparison with data from our simulations , and the results are shown in figure 6 .",
    "as predicted , all mean switching time data from different uniaxial tilts collapses on top of each other after a rescaling by each tilt s proper critical current .    in comparing our scaling relationships between current and mean switching time with the previous literature , a subtle issue must be addressed .",
    "results obtained by apalkov and visscher  @xcite rely upon an initial averaging of the dynamics in energy space over constant energy trajectories ( limit for small damping ) and only subsequently applying weak noise methods to extrapolate switching time dependences .",
    "the small damping and weak noise limits are singular and the order in which they are taken is important .",
    "both limits radically alter the form of the equations : whereas both limits suppress thermal effects , the first also severely restrains the deterministic evolution of the magnetic system .",
    "our approach considers the weak noise limit and , only in discussing the effects of an angular tilt between polarization and easy axes do we employ the small damping averaging technique to obtain functional forms for the mean switching time .",
    "the switching time data shown seems to justify , in this particular , an interchangeability between these two limits .",
    "more generally , however , one should not expect the two limits to commute .    ) where @xmath93 stands for tesla : real time is obtained upon division by @xmath34.,width=384 ]",
    "up until now , we have analyzed the main properties of spin - torque induced switching dynamics by concentrating solely on the mean switching times . in experiments , though , one generally constructs full probability curves .",
    "the probability that a given magnetic particle has a switching time @xmath128 can be explicitely written as :    @xmath129&=&\\int_0^{m(\\tau)}dx\\rho_b(x)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\exp[-\\xi(1-m(\\tau)^2)]\\frac{f[\\sqrt{\\xi}m(\\tau)]}{f[\\sqrt{\\xi}]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath130 is the initial magnitization that is switched deterministically in time @xmath131 .",
    "once one has evaluated @xmath130 , the probability curve follows . ideally , in the ballistic regime",
    ", one would like to invert the ballistic equations .",
    "unfortunately , though , the solutions of such ballistic equations are generally transcendental and can not be inverted analytically . even in the simpler collinear case , as can be seen from equations ( 14 ) and ( 18 ) , no analytical inversion is possible .",
    "one must instead compute the inversion numerically .",
    "nonetheless , one can construct appropriate analytical approximations by inverting the dominant terms in the expressions . in the case of ( 14 ) , for example , one has that for currents much larger than the critical current :    @xmath132\\ ] ]    which can be inverted to give :    @xmath133.\\ ] ]    plugging into expression ( 25 ) for the @xmath131 probability curve , one has :    @xmath134=\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\xi}{\\cosh^2[\\alpha\\tau\\frac{i^2 - 1}{i}]}\\right]\\frac{f[\\sqrt{\\xi}\\tanh[\\alpha\\tau\\frac{i^2 - 1}{i}]]}{f[\\sqrt{\\xi}]},\\ ] ]    this expression can be truncated to a simpler form by noting that the leading exponential term dominates over the ratio of dawson functions . furthermore ,",
    "if one considers the limit of large values for @xmath131 ( or , analogously , @xmath135 ) , the ` @xmath136 ' can be also approximated by its leading exponential term .",

    "one constructs probability curves by considering the mean switching time and modeling a purely thermal reversal as a decay process with rate given by equation ( 24 ) .",
    "the fraction of switched states then vary in time as :    @xmath137    upon introducing uniaxial tilt , precessional effects can be witnessed directly on the switching probability curves in the super - critical regime .",
    "one expects that in the initial phases of switching , the fraction of switched states is sensitive to the time at which the current is turned off .",
    "one may accidentally turn off the current during a moment of transient passage through the switched region along the precessional orbit .",
    "this was checked and verified from our numerical simulations ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "more generally , effects similar to the  waviness \" seen in the mean switching time curves can be seen in the probability curves as well as the angle of uniaxial tilt is allowed to vary ( see figure 8) .",

    "analytical results were then compared with detailed numerical simulations of the stochastic llg equation .",
    "the massively parallel capabilities of our gpu devices has allowed us to explore the behavior of macrospin dynamics over six orders of temporal magnitude . comparing to our analytical results",

    "different geometrical configurations of the uniaxial anisotropy axis with respect to the spin - current axis were shown to influence the thermally activated regime very minimally inasmuch as the currents were rescaled by the proper critical current of the angular setup . only in the super - critical regime were distinctions shown to exist due to complex precessional and transient switching behavior .",
    "these results have important implications for the analysis of experimental data in which measurements of the switching time versus current pulse amplitude are used to determine the energy barrier to magnetization reversal .",
    "clearly use of the correct asymptotic scaling form is essential to properly determine the energy barrier to reversal .",
    "the energy barrier , in turn , is very important in assessing the thermal stability of magnetic states of thin film elements that are being developed for long term data storage in stt - mram .",
    "further work should address how these results extend to systems with easy plane anisotropy and situations in which the nanomagnet has internal degrees of freedom , leading to a break down of the macrospin approximation .",
    "we also note that current flow is a source of shot noise , which at low frequencies acts like a white - noise source in much the same way as thermal noise .",
    "it is therefore interesting to understand when this additional source of noise plays a role .",
    "for a magnetic layer coupled to unpolarized leads , the current induced noise on the magnetization dynamics was found to be @xmath141  @xcite , where @xmath142 is the voltage drop across the magnetic layer , while @xmath143 is a dimensionless ratio characterizing the coupling strength of the magnetic layer to the left ( l ) and right ( r ) leads .",
    "thus the noise is maximal ( @xmath144 ) for perfectly symmetrical couplings , and is smaller in the limit of highly asymmetric contacts .",
    "this basic behavior , and the order of magnitude of the effect , is not likely to be modified by polarized leads .",
    "we argue that the temperatures at which the experiments have been performed current noise effects are not important .",
    "the experiments are performed at room temperature where @xmath145 k. for an all - metallic device , such as a spin - valve nanopillar , the couplings are nearly symmetrical and at the critical current a typical voltage drop across the magnetic layer is less than @xmath146v or , equivalently , @xmath120 k. for a magnetic tunnel junction device @xmath142 can be @xmath147 v. however , in this case the coupling is asymmetric .",
    "one lead ( l ) forms a magnetic tunnel junction with the nanomagnet , while the other ( r ) a metallic contact .",
    "this gives @xmath148 and a relevant energy @xmath147 k , again far lower than room temperature .",
    "it appears that current induced noise can only be important at room temperature for a nanomagnet coupled symmetrically between two tunnel barriers .",

    "<S> we have developed an efficient gpu - based micromagnetic code to simulate the stochastic llg dynamics out to millisecond timescales . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effects of geometrical tilts between the spin - current and uniaxial anisotropy axes on the thermally assisted dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even in the absence of axial symmetry , the switching times can be functionally described in a form virtually identical to the collinear case . </S>",
    "<S> we further verify that asymptotic behavior is reached fairly slowly , thus quantifying the role of thermal noise in the crossover regime linking deterministic to thermally assisted magnetization reversal . </S>"
