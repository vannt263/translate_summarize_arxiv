    "in many numerical simulations in general relativity one integrates einstein s field equations on a spatially compact domain with artificial timelike boundaries , effectively truncating the computational domain .",
    "this raises the question of how to specify boundary conditions . in this article",
    "we address this question within the context of the cauchy formulation , in which the field equations split into evolution and constraint equations .",
    "we adopt a free evolution approach , in which the constraints are solved on the initial time slice only and the future of the initial slice is computed by integrating the evolution equations .",
    "boundary conditions within this approach should ideally satisfy the following three requirements : ( i ) be compatible with the constraints in the sense of guaranteeing that initial data which solves the constraint equations yields constraint - satisfying solutions , ( ii ) permit to control , in some sense , the gravitational degrees of freedom at the boundary , and ( iii ) be stable in the sense of yielding a well posed initial - boundary value problem ( ibvp ) .",
    "there are several motivations for the construction of boundary conditions satisfying the above properties .",
    "first , recent detailed analysis of binary neutron star evolutions @xcite showed that the presence of artificial boundaries in current state of the art evolutions , which use rather ad hoc boundary conditions , dramatically affects the dynamics in the strong field region , near the stars .",
    "while it can be argued that this effect should disappear when placing the boundaries further and further away from the strong field region , until ideally , the region of interest in the computational domain is causally disconnected from the boundaries , in practice , this would require huge computer resources , especially in the three - dimensional case . even though some kind of mesh refinement should help in placing the boundaries far away , there is in any case a minimum resolution needed in the far region in order to reasonably represent wave propagation , thus constraining the size of the computational domain for a given amount of memory .",
    "next , an understanding of boundary conditions is important if the evolution equations include elliptic equations , since in this case effects from the boundaries can propagate with infinite speed , and so have an immediate effect on the fields being evolved .",
    "examples of cases in which elliptic equations arise include elliptic gauge conditions ( such as maximal slicing @xcite or minimal distortion conditions @xcite ) and constraint projection @xcite methods .",
    "finally , isolating the physical degrees of freedom at the boundaries should be important in view of cauchy - characteristic ( see @xcite for a review ) or cauchy - perturbative @xcite matching techniques , where a cauchy code is coupled to a characteristic or perturbative `` outer module '' which is well adapted to carry out the evolution in the far zone . in these cases",
    ", it is important to communicate only the physical degrees of freedom at the boundary between the two codes , since the cauchy code and the outer module might be based on completely different formulations .",
    "boundary conditions satisfying requirement ( i ) can be constructed by analyzing the constraint propagation system , which constitutes an evolution system for the constraint variables and is a consequence of bianchi s identities and the evolution equations .",
    "if it can be cast into first order symmetric hyperbolic form , the imposition of homogeneous maximally dissipative boundary conditions @xcite for the constraint propagation system guarantees that a smooth enough solution of the evolution system ( if it exists ) which satisfies the constraints initially automatically satisfies the constraints at later times .",
    "homogeneous maximally dissipative boundary conditions consist in a linear relation between the in- and outgoing characteristic fields of the system , which is chosen such that an energy estimate can be derived .",
    "this energy estimate implies that the unique solution of the constraint propagation system with zero initial data is zero , i.e. that the constraints are preserved during evolution .",
    "maximally dissipative boundary conditions for the constraint variables usually translate into differential conditions for the fields satisfying the main evolution equations , since the constraint variables depend on derivatives of the main variables .",
    "this means that the resulting boundary conditions for the main system usually are not of maximally dissipative type and , as discussed below , analyzing well posedness of the corresponding ibvp becomes more difficult .",
    "requirement ( ii ) , controlling the physical degrees of freedom , is a difficult one since there are no known _ local _",
    "expressions for the energy or the energy flux density in general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , one should be able to control the physical degrees of freedom in some approximate sense , as for example in the weak field regime approximation , in which one linearizes the equations around flat spacetime . in this approximation",
    ", it might be a good idea to specify conditions through the weyl tensor , since it is invariant with respect to infinitesimal coordinate transformations of minkowski spacetime . more precisely ,",
    "since there are two gravitational degrees of freedom , we should specify two linearly independent combinations of the components of the weyl tensor .",
    "below we will discuss boundary conditions which involve the newman - penrose complex scalars @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) with respect to a null tetrad adapted to the time - evolution vector field and the normal to the boundary .",
    "if the boundary is at null infinity these scalars represent the in- and outgoing gravitational radiation , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that these scalars are invariant with respect to infinitesimal coordinate transformations and tetrad rotations for linear fluctuations of any petrov type d solution represented in an adapted background tetrad @xcite .",
    "this class of solutions not only comprises flat spacetime but also the family of kerr solutions describing stationary rotating black holes . since in many physical situations",
    "one is interested in modeling asymptotically flat spacetimes , such that if the outer boundary is placed sufficiently far away from the strong field region spacetime can be described by a perturbed kerr black hole , we expect the boundary condition @xmath3 to be a good approximation for a `` non - reflecting '' wave condition .",
    "these boundary conditions are actually part of the family of conditions imposed in the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , to date the only known well posed initial - boundary value formulation of the vacuum einstein equations , and were also considered in @xcite .    requirement ( iii ) , the well posedness of the resulting ibvp , turns out to be a difficult problem as well : for quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic systems with maximally dissipative boundary conditions there are well - known well posedness theorems @xcite which state that a ( local in time ) solution exists in some appropriate hilbert space , that the solution is unique , and that it depends continuously on the initial and boundary data .",
    "the proof of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on these techniques . there , using a formulation based on tetrad fields , the authors manage to obtain a symmetric hyperbolic system by adding suitable combinations of the constraints to the evolution equations in such a way that the constraints propagate tangentially to the boundary . in this way",
    ", the issue of preserving the constraints becomes , in some sense , trivial .",
    "( see @xcite for a treatment in spherical symmetry in which the constraints propagate tangentially to the boundary as well . )",
    "however , for the more commonly used metric formulations it seems difficult to achieve tangential propagation for the constraints with a symmetric or strongly hyperbolic system , and therefore , one has to deal with either constraint propagation across the boundary or systems that are not strongly or symmetric hyperbolic .",
    "here we choose to deal with constraint propagation across the boundary and strongly or symmetric hyperbolic systems .",
    "there has been a lot of effort in understanding such systems , both at the analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite level .",
    "although partial proofs of well posedness have been obtained using symmetric hyperbolic systems with maximally dissipative boundary conditions @xcite , it seems that these kind of boundary conditions are not flexible enough since constraint - preserving boundary conditions usually yield differential conditions .    in this article",
    "we construct constraint - preserving boundary conditions ( cpbc ) for a family of first order strongly and symmetric hyperbolic evolution systems for einstein s equations . for definiteness , we focus on the formulation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is a generalization of the einstein - christoffel type formulations @xcite with a bona - mass type of gauge condition @xcite for the lapse . however , our approach is quite general and should also be applicable to other hyperbolic formulations of einstein s equations .",
    "in section [ sect : shlg ] we briefly review the family of formulations considered here and recall under which conditions the main evolution equations are strongly or symmetric hyperbolic . in section [",
    "sect : escv ] we discuss the constraint propagation system and analyze under what circumstances it is symmetric hyperbolic .",
    "having cast this system in symmetric hyperbolic form we impose cpbc via homogeneous maximally dissipative boundary conditions for the constraint variables .",
    "these conditions are differential boundary conditions when expressed in terms of the fields satisfying the main system .",
    "we complete these boundary conditions in section [ sect : bc ] by imposing extra conditions which control the physical and gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "there are several possibilities for doing so , of which we analyze the following two : 1 ) we first specify algebraic conditions in the form of a coupling between the outgoing and ingoing characteristic fields ( referred to as cpbc without weyl control later in this article ) ; 2 ) we specify boundary conditions via the weyl scalars @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as discussed above ( referred to as cpbc with weyl control later in this article )",
    ".    section [ sect : fl ] is devoted to an analysis of the well posedness of the resulting ibvp . as mentioned above ,",
    "this is a difficult problem since our boundary conditions are not in algebraic form .",
    "i particular , they are not in maximally dissipative form , so we can not apply the standard theorems for symmetric systems with maximally dissipative boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , our goal here is more modest : we analyze the ibvp in the `` high frequency limit '' by considering high - frequency perturbations of smooth solutions . in this regime",
    "the equations become linear with constant coefficients , and the domain can be taken to be a half plane . in this case solutions",
    "can be constructed explicitly by performing a laplace transformation in time and a fourier transformation in the spatial directions that are tangential to the boundary .",
    "this leads to the verification that a certain determinant is non - zero . if this determinant condition is violated , the system admits ill posed modes growing exponentially in time with an arbitrarily small growth time .",
    "therefore , the determinant condition yields _ necessary _ conditions for well posedness of the resulting ibvp and allows us to discard several cases which would lead to an ill posed formulation .",
    "_ these ill posed formulations appear even in cases in which both the main and the constraint propagation system are symmetric hyperbolic_. we also stress that the determinant condition verified in this article is a weaker version of the celebrated kreiss condition @xcite , which yields well posed ibvp for hyperbolic problems with _ algebraic _ boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "however , the kreiss condition guarantees nothing for the present case of _ differential _ boundary conditions .",
    "see @xcite for an example of an ibvp with differential boundary conditions which satisfies the kreiss condition but fails to be well posed in @xmath4 .",
    "in section [ sect : nr ] we discretize the ibvp by the method of lines .",
    "the spatial derivatives are discretized using finite difference operators that satisfy the summation by parts property and we explain in detail how we numerically implement our cpbc . then",
    ", in sections [ sect : sim1 ] and [ sect : sim ] we perform the following @xmath0d numerical tests : first , we evolve ibvps which fail to fulfill the determinant condition and are therefore ill posed .",
    "the goal of evolving these systems is to confirm the expected lack of numerical stability .",
    "we do confirm such instability , finding an obvious lack of convergence : the results exhibit exponentially in time growing modes , where the exponential factor gets larger as resolution is increased , as predicted by our analytical analysis .",
    "next , we focus on evolutions of two systems that do satisfy the determinant condition , differing only on whether they control components of the weyl tensor at the boundary or not .",
    "finally , we compare stable evolutions of systems with cpbc with evolutions where maximally dissipative boundary conditions are given for the _ main _ evolution system , and are therefore expected to violate the constraints .",
    "we first analyze evolutions of these four systems through a _ robust stability test _ @xcite . in this test",
    ", random initial and boundary data is specified at different resolutions , and the growth rate in the time evolved fields is observed .",
    "a growth rate that becomes _ larger _ as resolution is increased is a strong indication of a numerical instability , while for numerical stability the growth rate should be _ bounded _ by a constant that is independent of resolution .",
    "we find that systems that violate the determinant condition fail to pass the robust stability test , as expected .",
    "however , we _ also _ find that at least some systems with cpbc with weyl control which satisfy the determinant condition are numerically unstable as well , although in a somehow weaker sense ( explained in the text ) that reminds the numerical evolution of weakly hyperbolic systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the systems with cpbc without weyl control which satisfy the determinant condition that we have evolved pass the robust stability test for the length of our simulations ( usually between @xmath5 and @xmath6 crossing times ) .",
    "next , we concentrate on evolutions of brill waves @xcite , and confirm the expectations drawn from the robust stability test in what concerns numerical stability .",
    "using these waves we further concentrate on a detailed comparison between the results using maximally dissipative boundary conditions for the main evolution system and stable cpbc .",
    "our convergence tests strongly suggest that in the former case the constraint variables _ do not _ converge to zero in the limit of infinite resolution , implying that one _ does not _ obtain a solution to einstein s field equations , while in the latter case for the same resolutions the constraint variables do converge to zero .",
    "next we concentrate on the stable cpbc case and evolve pure gauge solutions , using high order accurate finite difference operators which satisfy the summation by parts property .",
    "the operators used are eighth order accurate in the interior points and fourth order accurate at and near the boundary points .    as a final numerical experiment",
    ", we also concentrate on the stable cpbc case and inject pulses of gravitational radiation through the boundaries of an initially flat spacetime .",
    "we inject pulses of large enough amplitude to create very large curvature in the interior ( as measured by curvature invariants ) , showing that our cpbc are strong enough to handle very non - linear dynamics .",
    "the order of magnitude achieved by the curvature invariant measured corresponds to being at roughly @xmath7 from the singularity , in a schwarzschild spacetime of mass one . in these simulations",
    "this curvature is produced _ solely _ by the injected pulses .",
    "a summary of the results and conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : conc ] .",

    "furthermore , we have discussed different possibilities for using constraint - preserving boundary conditions in order to control the gauge and physical degrees of freedom at the boundary .",
    "one of these possibilities ( which we called cpbc with weyl control ) is attractive from a physical point of view since it provides boundary data to the weyl scalars @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which at null infinity represent the in- and outgoing radiation .",
    "furthermore , these scalars are gauge - invariant for linearizations about the kerr metric , an approximation that should be good in many simulations provided the boundaries can be moved sufficiently far from the strong field region .",
    "we also discussed simpler ways ( which we called cpbc without weyl control ) of controlling the physical degrees of freedom ; however , their physical interpretation is less clear .",
    "next , we analyzed the stability of the resulting ibvp by analytical and numerical means . by considering high - frequency perturbations we obtained the corresponding frozen coefficient problem which is linear and",
    "can be analyzed using fourier - laplace transformations . in this way",
    ", one obtains a determinant condition which is a necessary condition for the well posedness of the problem .",
    "the satisfaction of this condition restricts the freedom in the choice of parameters in the formulation and the boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , we found that the violation of the determinant condition leads to the presence of ill posed constraint - violating or gauge modes .",
    "these modes are ill posed in the sense that they grow exponentially in time with an exponential factor that is unbounded .",
    "one could say that the boundary conditions are responsible for the presence of these modes since , in the absence of boundaries , the initial value problem is well posed because the evolution equations are strongly hyperbolic .",
    "a further example of boundary conditions leading to an instability of an otherwise stable initial - value problem is given in [ app : sfs ] .",
    "next , we performed three - dimensional numerical simulations . in order to do so",
    ", we extended an earlier finite - differencing code and implemented the constraint - preserving boundary conditions .",
    "we first performed a robust stability test which consists in specifying random initial and boundary data for different resolutions and checking that the time evolution of the fields does not exhibit unbounded resolution - dependent growth .",
    "we found that the set of cpbc without weyl control considered in this article is robustly stable in this sense .",
    "we also compared the results from these boundary conditions with results obtained by simply freezing the ingoing fields of the main evolution system to their initial values . while both systems are robustly stable , we found very strong evidence for the freezing boundary condition to yield _ constraint - violating _ solutions :",
    "in contrast to the cpbc , the constraint variables seem to converge to a nonzero value for freezing boundary conditions .",
    "we further tested the cpbc without weyl control by evolving a gauge solution and weak brill waves , and found that in both cases the constraint variables seem to converge to zero .",
    "finally , as an application , we considered a situation in which one starts with flat initial data and injects `` pulses of gravitational radiation '' through the boundaries , of enough amplitude to create very large curvature in the interior .",
    "we expect the cpbc without weyl control to be useful for many applications , like improving the accuracy and stability of current binary black hole and binary neutron star simulations or for a successful implementation of characteristic or perturbative matching techniques @xcite    unfortunately , our numerical results for the cpbc with weyl control do not pass the robust stability test , although the instability in this case is much weaker than for the case of cpbc that violate the determinant condition .",
    "there are several possible causes for this instability .",
    "first , it is not clear if this instability is caused by a `` bad '' discretization of the problem  the continuum ibvp being well posed  or if the continuum problem is actually ill posed and thus the cause for the instability observed .",
    "another possible source of problem is the cubical domain used in our simulations , which has edges and corners",
    ". it might be that we violate some compatibility conditions at such points and that this causes an instability .",
    "whatever the cause of the instability might be , it would be nice to have a better analytic insight into the problem .",
    "although the determinant condition used here is necessary for the well posedness of the ibvp it is not sufficient , not even for the frozen coefficient problem .",
    "when making such a statement we have to specify in what sense we expect the ibvp to be well posed . in the linear regime , we expect the problem to be well posed with respect to a hilbert space that controls the @xmath4 norm of the fields and the @xmath4 norm of the constraint variables . in this case , there are explicit examples @xcite that show that the satisfaction of the determinant condition is _ not _ sufficient for well posedness .",
    "a different examples which applies to the ibvp considered in this article is given in [ app : sfs ] .",
    "clearly , it would be much more satisfactory to derive cpbc with and without weyl control for which well posedness can be guaranteed .",
