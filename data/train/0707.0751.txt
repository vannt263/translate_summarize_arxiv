    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite ( fdt ) is one of the fundamental accomplishments of linear response theory applied to equilibrium systems . according to the fdt a response function @xmath0 , describing the effects of a small perturbation exerted on a system ,",
    "is linearly related , via the equilibrium temperature @xmath1 , to a correlation function @xmath2 of the the system in the absence of the perturbation . in the language of magnetic systems , which we shall adopt in the following ,",
    "one usually considers the application of an external magnetic field @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the magnetic susceptibility .    in recent years",
    "there has been a considerable interest , arisen in different fields such as turbulent fluids  @xcite , disordered , glassy  @xcite and aging systems  @xcite , in the generalization of the results of linear response theory to out of equilibrium systems .",
    "differently from equilibrium statistical mechanics , where a well funded and controlled theory is available , there is not nowadays a theorem of a generality comparable to the fdt for non - equilibrium states .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting progresses have been done in understanding some particular aspects of non - equilibrium linear response theory , some of which will be discussed in this paper .",
    "a first basic question regards the possibility of generalizing the fdt .",
    "namely , the question is whether also away from equilibrium it is still possible to relate the response function to properties of the unperturbed dynamics , possibly in the form of correlation functions .",
    "a positive answer to this question exists when the time evolution is markovian and described by a differential equation of the langevin type  @xcite or for systems described by a master equation  @xcite . in this case , the response function is related to correlation functions of the unperturbed systems , which , however , are not only the correlation @xmath2 involved in equilibrium .",
    "these results are particularly important since they allow the study of the response function without considering the perturbed system , which is generally more complicated .",
    "once a relation between response and correlations is established , at least in the restricted framework of markov processes , the natural question is which piece of information , if any , can be learned from it about the non - equilibrium state . in equilibrium",
    "the linear relation between @xmath4 and @xmath2 is universal , and the coefficient @xmath5 entering this relation is @xmath1 . in the restricted area of aging systems it has been shown that the @xmath6 relation still bears an universal character , although weaker than in equilibrium .",
    "this is because the theorem by franz , mezard , parisi and peliti  @xcite connects @xmath6 to the equilibrium probability distribution of the overlaps @xmath7 and different statistical mechanical systems can be classified into few universality classes on the basis of their @xmath7 according to the replica symmetry breaking character of the ground state  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 can be interpreted as an _ effective _ temperature  @xcite .",
    "these results promoted linear response theory as an important tool to investigate the non - equilibrium behavior or even the structure of equilibrium states of complex systems , such as spin glasses , which are hard to equilibrate , where @xmath7 can be better inferred from a non - equilibrium measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "however , in order for these studies to be sound , a basic understanding of the out of equilibrium behavior of the response function is required . instead , already at the level of coarsening systems , which can be considered as the simplest paradigm of aging phenomenon , where a satisfactory general analytic description can nowadays be given by means of exactly solvable models or approximate theories , the scaling properties of the response function are non trivial and still far from being understood .",
    "notably , the statics - dynamics connection stated by the theorem  @xcite is not always fulfilled in coarsening systems .    in this paper",
    "we review some recent progresses in the field of non - equilibrium linear response theory .",

    "a very useful tool for the study of slow relaxation phenomena has been introduced by cugliandolo and kurchan  @xcite through the off- equilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation ( fdr ) .",

    ". a milder statement of stochastic stability is that @xmath53 coincides with @xmath55 up to the effects of a global symmetry which might be removed by the perturbation .",

    "the main source of the differences is the simplicity of the free energy landscape in the case of phase ordering compared to the complexity underlying glassy behavior .    besides the obvious motivation that the basic",
    ", paradigmatic cases need to be thoroughly understood , an additional reason for studying phase ordering , among others , is that in some cases the existence of complex slow relaxation is identified through the exclusion of coarsening .",
    "an example comes from the long standing controversy about the nature of the low temperature phase of finite dimensional spin glasses .",

    "focusing on the integrated response function  ( [ integ ] ) , or zero field cooled magnetization ( zfc ) in the language of magnetic systems , it will be argued that the response function in phase ordering systems is not as trivial as it is believed to be and , after all , it is not the quantity best suited to highlight the differences between systems with and without replica symmetry breaking . in fact , as discussed in secs .",
