    "the notion of measure free martingale is implicit in the construction of equivalent martingale measures in the theory of asset pricing in financial mathematics @xcite , but it has not been fully isolated and made free of probability . rather it has remained hidden by specific processes and terminology of asset pricing theory .",
    "we define a martingale purely in terms of sets and functions , called measure free martingale , and show that every martingale is a measure free martingale and conversely that every measure free martingale admits a probability measure , which may be finitely additive , under which it is a martingale .",
    "we describe the convex set ( together with their extreme points ) of all probability measures under which a measure free martingale is a martingale . among these measures",
    "there is one which in some sense is most symmetric or most well spread , and entirely determined by the measure free martingale .",
    "boltzmann s entropy maximizing distribution is needed here . to the best of our knowledge",
    "probabilist s have not asked the simple question as to when a sequence of function is a martingale under some measure .",
    "the answer is relatively easy but has some pedagogic as well as research value .",
    "let @xmath1 be @xmath2 real numbers , with repetitions allowed .",
    "assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the smallest and the largest of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a real number .",
    "then there exists a probability vector @xmath7 such that @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 . if @xmath10 and @xmath11 , such a probability vector is unique . if @xmath12 , it is not unique without some additional requirements .",
    "a result of boltzmann proved using lagrange s multipliers says that there is a unique probability vector @xmath13 which satisfies @xmath14 , and maximizes the entropy @xmath15 it is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "we will call these probabilities the boltzmann probabilities for @xmath18 .    in this connection",
    "it should be noted that for a fixed @xmath19 and variable @xmath17 , the probabilities @xmath20 of @xmath21 respectively have the mean @xmath22 which we denote by @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are minimum and maximum of @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the frequency of occurrence of @xmath27 in @xmath19 . as a consequence , @xmath28 a calculation shows that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the variance of the system @xmath24 with probabilities @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath23 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath17 which assumes every value between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if @xmath32 , then @xmath31 are the probabilities which maximize the entropy for the constraint @xmath33 .",

    "it is easy to see that its extreme points are precisely those @xmath37 which have at most two non - zero entries .",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - empty set .",
    "let @xmath38 , @xmath39 be a sequence of real valued functions such that each @xmath38 has a finite range , say @xmath40 , and these values are assumed on the subsets @xmath41 .",
    "these sets form a partition of @xmath0 which we denote by @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the partition generated by @xmath44 and the algebra generated by @xmath43 is denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the algebra @xmath47 .",
    "define @xmath45 measurable functions @xmath48 as follows : for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 m_n(\\omega ) & = \\max_{q\\in q}f_{n+1}(q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath52    the sequence @xmath53 is said to be a measure free martingale or probability free martingale if @xmath54    clearly , for each @xmath55 , the function @xmath38 is constant on @xmath56 .",
    "we denote this constant by @xmath57 . with this notation",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath53 is a measure free martingale or probability free martingale if and only if for each @xmath58 and for each @xmath59 , @xmath57 lies between the minimum and the maximum values of @xmath60 as @xmath61 runs over @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to see that if there is a probability measure on @xmath46 with respect to which @xmath63 is a martingale , then @xmath63 is also a measure free martingale . indeed , let @xmath64 be such a measure .",
    "then , for any @xmath56 in @xmath65 , @xmath66 is equal to @xmath67 so that @xmath66 lies between the minimum and the maximum values @xmath60 , @xmath68 .",
    "the theorem below proves the converse .",
    "given a measure free martingale @xmath63 , there exists for each @xmath69 , a measure @xmath70 on @xmath45 such that @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the conditional expectation with respect to the probability measure @xmath73 .",

    "since @xmath53 is a measure free martingale , @xmath86 lies between the minimum and the maximum values of @xmath82 on @xmath56 , so there is a probability vector @xmath87 such that @xmath88    we define @xmath89 carrying out this procedure for all @xmath90 we get a probability measure @xmath73 on @xmath80 for which it is easy to check that @xmath91    induction completes the proof of the existence of the measures @xmath70 .",

    "the totality of such measures forms a convex set whose extreme points are precisely those @xmath64 which have the property that for any @xmath58 and for any @xmath55 , @xmath64 ( hence @xmath73 ) assigns positive probability to at most two elements in the partition of @xmath56 induced by @xmath82 .",
    "if , for each @xmath58 and for each @xmath55 , @xmath62 has two or less elements , then there is only one martingale measure for the measure free martingale @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath56 be an element in @xmath96 .",
    "if we assign boltzmann probabilities of the values of @xmath82 on @xmath56 to the corresponding elements of the partition of @xmath56 induced by @xmath82 , then we have the following theorem .",

    "a question arises .",
    "note that we can associate the number @xmath17 to the set @xmath56 in theorem  2 .",
    "when we do this for all @xmath112 we have a function @xmath113 defined on @xmath0 .",
    "is @xmath114 a measure free martingale ?",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a compact metric space and that sets in @xmath46 form a clopen base for its topology .",
