    "for the past 20 years , traditional helioseismology techniques have provided a wealth of information regarding the internal structure and dynamics of the sun in both the convection and radiation zones @xcite . except for the solar core , probing",
    "the sun s interior has been achieved by direct analysis of the pressure modes detected in doppler observations of surface radial velocities .    however , the g modes ( or gravity modes ) , that probe the very core of the sun where thermonuclear reactions take place , remain elusive .",
    "these modes are expected to have very small velocity amplitudes at the solar surface , thereby making them very difficult to detect using conventional doppler techniques . for a review of the search of g modes using doppler velocity data",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "furthermore , garcia et al .",
    "@xcite recently claimed to have detected a collective signature of the dipole g modes .    in order to make significant progress towards a total understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the sun , from the solar surface down through the core to the very center , we require an unambiguous detection of solar g modes .",
    "one of the main goals of the astrod project is to search for the signature of g modes in the gravitational field of the sun @xcite .",
    "the primary objective for the long - term astrod concept is to maintain a minimum of 3 spacecraft in orbit within our solar system using laser interferometric ranging to ultimately test relativity .",
    "this is separated into 3 distinct stages , each with increasing orders of scientific benefits and engineering milestones .",
    "the first stage , astrod i , will comprise a single spacecraft in communication with ground stations using laser pulse ranging , orbiting the sun at an average distance of approximately 0.6 au .",
    "see figure [ astrodi ] for a schematic of the proposed orbit design .",
    "the second phase , astrod ii , will consist of three spacecraft communicating with 1 - 2 watt cw lasers .",
    "two of these ( s / c 1 and s / c 2 ) will be in separate solar orbits and a third ( s / c ) is to be situated at the sun - earth lagrangian point l1 ( or l2 ) .",
    "it is this configuration which is capable of detecting gravitational effects induced by solar g modes .",
    "see figure [ astrodii ] for a depiction of the orbit design and configuration of the spacecraft 700 days after launch .        the third and final stage , astrod iii or super astrod ,",
    "will then explore the possibility of larger orbits in an effort to detect even lower frequency primordiial waves .",
    "figure [ astrodplotdsa ] displays various , theoretical and observed , limitations for the solar velocity amplitudes of the quadrupole ( @xmath2 ) g modes , as well as the anticipated gravity strain sensitivities for astrod .",
    "g modes ( quadrupole modes ) : theoretical estimates reproduced from gough @xcite ( red curve ) and kumar et al .",
    "@xcite ( blue curve ) ; the green line is an observational limit that was estimated from garcia et al .",
    "@xcite ; the black curve is the astrod detection level assuming a one year integration time and a spacecraft orbiting at 0.4 au.,width=480 ]    the two theoretical models comprise the most pessimistic estimate from kumar et al",
    ". @xcite ( blue curve ) and the most optimistic estimate from gough @xcite ( red curve ) ; see @xcite for a similar discussion .",
    "both gough and kumar et al .",
    "assume that the g - modes are stochastically excited .",
    "the paper by gough presents an application of the energy equipartition result of goldreich and keeley @xcite . whereas kumar et al .",
    "use the theoretical work of goldreich et al .",
    "@xcite and show that the model predicts p mode amplitudes which match observations very well and are therefore confident that any errors in their calculations will be less than one order of magnitude .    the observational upper - limit is continuously being improved with significant advances in both data analysis methods and data acquisition technology .",
    "reliable estimates were published in 2000 by appouchaux et al .",
    "@xcite , whereby they analysed 784 days of soho / mdi data .",
    "they found that the @xmath2 quadrupole g mode amplitudes are no greater than approximately 9 mm s@xmath3 at 200 @xmath4hz , which decreases to 2.5 mm s@xmath3 at 1000 @xmath4hz ; this can be roughly approximated to display a @xmath5 dependence as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the pheobus group @xcite analysed 9 years of bison data to reduce the limit to around 3.5 mm @xmath6 at 300 @xmath4hz which corresponds to about 5 mm s@xmath3 at 200 @xmath4hz by again using the rough @xmath5 dependence . here",
    ", the upper - limit is reduced further again to 1 mm @xmath6 at 200 @xmath4hz .",
    "this was estimated from the noise levels in garcia et al .",
    "@xcite and this corresponds to an average of 50 modes observed by the golf instrument with 10 years of data ( green curve ) .",
    "the surface velocity amplitudes for astrod were calculated using the most recent gravity strain sensitivities in paton et al .",
    "@xcite , the equations presented in cutler et al .",
    "@xcite and taking into consideration that we have 2 - 3 spacecraft rather than a signal interferometer .",
    "the gravitational strain falls off as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance to the sun .",
    "astrod s capacity to detect g modes is due to a combination of good strain sensitivity , small distance from the sun and large distance between spacecraft .",
    "by assuming the best possible sensitivity for astrod ( @xmath9 at 100 @xmath4hz ) and even the most pessimistic amplitudes of kumar et al . , astrod may deliver unambiguous detection for g modes with frequencies between 100 @xmath4hz and 300 @xmath4hz .",
    "moreover , the detection of such `` high frequency '' g modes should provide better diagnostics of the inside of the sun than the lower frequency g modes ."
