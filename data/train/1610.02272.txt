    "<S> the perturbative qcd expansion for @xmath0 photoproduction appears to be unstable : the nlo correction is large ( and of opposite sign ) to the lo contribution . </S>",

    "<S> we show that perturbative stability is greatly improved by imposing a @xmath1 cut on the nlo coefficient functions ; a cut which is required to avoid double counting . </S>",
