    "if the width of the absorption features is due to a velocity distribution , the fhwm of this distribution would be @xmath012,600  km  s@xmath118 .",
    "one possibility is that the transient is galactic ( @xmath119 ) . for a galactic source ,",
    "the slope of the red continuum gives a lower limit blackbody temperature of 6500  k. the absorption features at 4320 and 4870    are consistent with @xmath120 ( 4341   ) and @xmath121 ( 4861   ) respectively , including uncertainty in the shape of the underlying continuum .",

    "no other narrowband emission or absorption lines are detected .",
    "the spacing of the five absorption features is inconsistent with periodicity in energy , as might be expected for cyclotron harmonics .",
    "oddly , the features are nearly ( but not exactly ) periodic in wavelength .",
    "it is also possible that the transient is extragalactic .",
    "the absence of lyman @xmath124 absorption features shortward of 4500   places a hard upper limit of @xmath125 on its redshift . among redshifts",
    "@xmath126 , the cluster redshift of @xmath8 is of specific interest as the transient is located a small projected distance from the center of the cluster . at this redshift ,",
    "the absorption feature at 5890    is consistent with mg  ii @xmath1232796 , 2803 .",
    "however , the remaining features are not identified at this redshift . given the observed spectral energy distribution , a peak apparent magnitude of @xmath127 implies a total peak observed flux of @xmath128 . at @xmath8 ,",
    "this implies a peak absolute bolometric magnitude of approximately @xmath129 .",
    "this is comparable to the peak absolute magnitudes of sn 2005ap ( @xmath130 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sn 2006gy ( @xmath131 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the two most luminous sne observed to date .",
    "finally , we note that the shape of the continuum is inconsistent with @xmath132 synchrotron radiation .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic data of an unusual optical transient discovered during the _ hst _ cluster sn survey .",
    "its key features are as follows : a rise time of @xmath0100 days with a roughly symmetric lightcurve ; small but statistically significant color variations across the lightcurve ; no detected host galaxy or progenitor ; broad spectral features in the blue , with a red continuum , and some evidence for spectral evolution .",
    "below , we first discuss constraints on the distance to the source .",
    "next we consider the possibility that the transient is the result of microlensing , finding this to be unlikely .",
    "lastly , we search for similar objects in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectral database , finding no convincing matches",
    ".    any detection of proper motion or parallax would be strong evidence of a galactic source .",
    "we tested for this by fitting the position of the transient in each of the six acs detection epochs using a 2-d gaussian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propmotion ] ) . in all",
    "epochs the position uncertainty is dominated by image coalignment errors caused by residual distortion , rather than statistical error in the fit .",
    "note that this uncertainty in relative position between epochs is distinct from the uncertainty in the absolute position of the transient discussed in  2 . for these images and this position ,",
    "we estimate this error to be  0.1 pixel ( @xmath133 ) in each coordinate .",
    "the most discrepant positions differ by approximately 0.25  pixels ( @xmath134 ) . as a whole ,",
    "the positions are consistent with no proper motion or parallax and give little indication of either .",
    "the upper limit on proper motion is @xmath135 .",
    "the upper limit on parallax is @xmath025  mas , which gives a lower limit on distance of @xmath040  pc .",
    "this limit excludes virtually any possible solar system object as the source of the brightening .",
    "we can derive a more significant constraint on distance from reference image magnitude limits , assuming that the transient is an outburst and a progenitor star exists .",
    "the dimmest stars ( aside from neutron stars ) known to undergo outbursts are white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "wds range in absolute magnitude from approximately 10  mag ( @xmath136  k ) to approximately 16  mag ( @xmath137  k ) and dimmer .",
    "if we assume the progenitor is a wd with absolute magnitude @xmath138 , the reference image @xmath3 upper limit of @xmath100 gives a distance @xmath3 lower limit of @xmath01.2  kpc . if the progenitor is a source dimmer than @xmath138 ( e.g. , a cooler wd or a neutron star ) , the constraints on distance are weaker . because the source is at high galactic latitude ( @xmath139 ) , a limit of 1.2  kpc places the wd outside the thin disk of the galaxy , as the thin disk has a wd scale height of approximately 300  pc @xcite .",
    "however , there is a significant population of relatively cool wds residing in the thick disk and stellar halo .",
    "galaxy models predict between tens @xcite and hundreds @xcite of wds far dimmer than our reference image detection limit in a single acs field at this galactic latitude . despite the large range ( which reflects the uncertainty in the density of ancient wds in the stellar halo )",
    "it is clear that the density is high enough to make a galactic wd a possible progenitor .",
    "although the symmetry of the lightcurve ( fig .  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) suggests that the transient is a microlensing event , this interpretation is unlikely .",
    "the lightcurve is dramatically broader than the theoretical lightcurve for microlensing of a point source by a single lens @xcite .",
    "the typical lightcurve fwhm of high - magnification ( peak magnification @xmath140 300 ) microlensing events is on the order of a few hours ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the transient s lightcurve fwhm is @xmath0100 days with a peak magnification @xmath3 lower limit of @xmath0120 .",
    "also , the color evolves a small but significant amount over the lightcurve , particularly between epochs eight and nine . some of these difficulties can be overcome if we assume the source is resolved ; this can both change the shape of the lightcurve and allow for color variation as different source regions are differentially magnified . however",
    ", this typically results in a lower peak magnification .",
    "finally , microlensing would still not explain the mysterious spectrum .",
    "in an effort to identify objects with similar spectra , we cross - correlated the broad features of the spectrum with the sdss spectral database .",
    "each sdss spectrum was warped with a polynomial function to best fit the keck spectrum , based on a least squares fit .",
    "the value of the root mean square of the difference between the spectra was used to determine the correlation .",
    "an allowance for relative redshift was made , with the requirement that the spectra overlapped in the range of the strongest features ( 3500 to 6200   ) .",
    "no convincing matches were found .",
    "changing the warping function between linear and quadratic and varying the wavelength range used in the fit altered which sdss objects had the highest correlation , but did not result in a more convincing match .",
    "the sdss objects with the highest correlation were broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) at various redshifts and carbon ( dq ) wds .",
    "although bal qsos do have similarly broad features , they do nt exhibit the spacing or rounded profiles of those of the transient .",
    "also , bal qsos typically include emission features .",
    "the dq wds most similar to the transient are known as dqp wds . like the transient",
    ", dqp wds have broad , rounded absorption features between 4000 and 6000    with a red continuum ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the positions and spacing of the absorption features shortward of 5000    differ greatly from those of the transient spectrum .",
    "in addition , dqp wds show increased emission toward the uv , which is not seen in the transient .",
    "the absence of similar spectra in the sdss database implies that such variables are either very rare or typically fainter than the sdss detection threshold , or both .",
    "if they are typically faint , this would seem to argue for an extragalactic origin , though a galactic origin is of course still possible .",
    "if this transient does indeed represent a new class of either galactic or extragalactic transients , such objects will be of great interest for future extensive surveys of the time - variable sky .",
