    "this note is not intended for a journal publication : it does not contain difficult results , and the proofs use only standard and well - known techniques .",
    "furthermore , some of the results are already known .",
    "however , they have their place in the context of the study of weighted trees , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "[ def : weighted ] a _ weighted bicolored plane tree _ , or a _ weighted tree _ , or just a _ tree _ for short , is a bicolored plane tree whose edges are endowed with positive integral _",
    "weights_. the sum of the weights of the edges of a tree is called the _ total weight _ of the tree .",
    "the _ degree _ of a vertex is the sum of the weights of the edges incident to this vertex .",
    "obviously , the sum of the degrees of black vertices , as well as the sum of the degrees of white vertices , is equal to the total weight @xmath0 of the tree .",
    "let the tree have @xmath1 black vertices , of degrees @xmath2 , and @xmath3  white vertices , of degrees @xmath4 , respectively",
    ". then the pair of partitions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is called _ passport _ of the tree .",
    "the _ weight distribution _ of a weighted tree is a partition @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of edges , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the weights of the edges . leaving aside the weights and considering only the underlying plane tree , we speak of a _ topological tree _ , which is a bicolored plane tree .",
    "weighted trees whose weight distribution is @xmath12 will be called _ ordinary trees _ :",
    "they coincide with the corresponding topological trees .",
    "the adjective _ plane _ in the above definition means that our trees are considered not as mere graphs but as plane maps .",
    "more precisely , this means that the cyclic order of branches around each vertex of the tree is fixed , and changing this order will in general give a different tree .",
    "_ all the trees considered in this paper will be endowed with the `` plane '' structure _ ; therefore , the adjective `` plane '' will often be omitted .",
    "[ ex : wt ] figure [ fig : wt ] shows an example of a weighted tree .",
    "the total weight of this tree is @xmath13 ; its passport is @xmath14 ; the weight distribution is @xmath15 .",
    "[ def : rooted ] a tree with a distinguished edge is called a _ rooted tree _ , and the distinguished edge itself",
    "is called its _",
    "root_. we consider the root edge as being oriented from black to white .",
    "the goal of this paper is the enumeration of rooted weighted ( bicolored plane ) trees .",
    "[ th : main ] let @xmath16 be the number of rooted weighted bicolored plane trees of weight  @xmath0 . then the generating function @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 numbers @xmath16 satisfy the following recurrence relation : @xmath19 the asymptotic formula for the numbers @xmath16 is @xmath20    let @xmath21 be the number of rooted weighted bicolored plane trees of weight  @xmath0 with @xmath22 edges .",
    "then the generating function @xmath23 is equal to @xmath24 the following is an explicit formula for the numbers @xmath21 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath22th catalan number",
    ".    denote @xmath27 the order of the automorphism group of a tree  @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the number of non - isomorphic non - rooted trees @xmath28 of weight @xmath0 , each counted with the factor @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 where the first sum is taken over all the non - isomorphic non - rooted trees @xmath28 of weight @xmath0 .",
    "the sequence @xmath16 is listed in the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences @xcite as the entry a002212 .",
    "it has many interpretations , some of them coming from chemistry . among the various interpretations there are `` multi - trees '' ( roland bacher , 2005 ) which correspond to our weighted trees .",
    "almost all the above - stated formulas may also be found in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex-36 ] shows the trees of weight  4 .",
    "there are ten trees in the picture , but in fact there are 16 non - isomorphic ( non - rooted ) trees of weight  4 .",
    "indeed , when we exchange black and white , four trees remain isomorphic to themselves while six others do nt , so we must add to the set the six missing trees .",
    "near each tree , the number of its possible rootings is indicated , with color exchange taken into account .",
    "we see that the total number of trees is  36 , which is the coefficient @xmath32 in front of @xmath33 in @xmath34 , see ( [ gf : a_n ] ) . among these 36 trees ,",
    "there is one tree with one edge , six trees with two edges , 15 trees with three edges , and 14 trees with four edges .",
    "these are the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath35 which stands in front of @xmath33 in @xmath36 , see ( [ gf : b_m , n ] ) .",
    "the number @xmath37 , according to , is equal to @xmath38 and , indeed , among the 16 non - isomorphic non - rooted trees there are ten asymmetric trees , four trees with the symmetry order 2 , and two trees with the symmetry order  4 , which gives @xmath39 we leave the details to the reader .",
    "there is a standard way of encoding rooted topological ( non - weighted ) plane trees by _ dyck words _ and _ dyck paths_. we start on the left bank of the root edge and go around the tree in the clockwise direction , writing the letter @xmath40 when we follow an edge for the first time , and the letter @xmath41 when we follow it the second time on its opposite side .",
    "a dyck path corresponding to a dyck word is a path on the plane which starts at the origin and takes a step @xmath42 for every letter @xmath40 and a step @xmath43 for every letter  @xmath41 .",
    "these objects may be easily characterized .    for a word @xmath44 which is a concatenation of the three words , @xmath45 (",
    "either is allowed to be empty ) , we call @xmath46 a _ prefix _ , @xmath47 a _ factor _ , and @xmath48 a _ suffix _ of  @xmath44 .",
    "[ def : dyck ] a _ dyck word _ is a word @xmath44 in the alphabet @xmath49 such that @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 and @xmath52 stand for the number of occurencies of @xmath40  and  @xmath41 in @xmath44 ) , while for any prefix @xmath53 of @xmath44 we have @xmath54 .",
    "a _ dyck path _ is a path on the plane which starts at the origin , takes steps @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and finishes on the horizontal axis , while always staying on the upper half - plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : dyck ] illustrates these notions .",
    "the root edge in the tree is shown by the thick line .",
    "note that a dyck word may be empty ; then it corresponds to the tree consisting of a single vertex .",
    "making an exception to the general rule , we do not color this vertex in black or white .",
    "thus , there exists a single empty word , and a single tree without edges .",
    "the following proposition is a trivial consequence of the construction .",
    "[ prop : tree - word ] there is a bijection between rooted bicolored plane trees and dyck words .",
    "there remains very little to do in order to describe weighted trees .",
    "there is a natural notion of coupling of the letters of a dyck word : a _ couple _ is the pair of letters @xmath55 standing on the opposite sides of the same edge .",
    "it is easy to recognize a couple in a word or in the path .",
    "let @xmath56 be a pair of letters in a dyck word , where @xmath40 comes before @xmath41 in @xmath44 .",
    "consider the factor @xmath57 of @xmath44 which starts with @xmath40 and terminates with @xmath41 .",
    "then the pair @xmath55 forms a couple if and only if the factor  @xmath53 between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a dyck word . in a dyck path , we take an ascending step corresponding to a letter @xmath40 and go horizontally until we meet a descending step opposite to it : this step corresponds to the letter @xmath41 which forms a couple with @xmath40 . in figure  [ fig : dyck ] , an example of a couple , both on the tree and in the word , is indicated in a boldface font , and the dashed arrow shows how to find the `` opposite '' step . the couple @xmath55 in which @xmath40 is the very first letter of the dyck word , corresponds to the root edge .",
    "now , returning to the weighted trees , we do the following : for every edge of the tree , we take the corresponding couple @xmath55 and replace it with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the weight of the edge .    [ def : gen - dyck ] a _ weighted dyck word _ is a word in the infinite alphabet @xmath60 which is a dyck word in which every couple of letters @xmath55 is replaced by a certain couple @xmath58 .",
    "we say that a couple @xmath58 has the weight @xmath59 , and the weight of a word is the sum of the weights of all its couples .    there is a bijection between rooted weighted bicolored plane trees and weighted dyck words .",
    "every non - empty dyck word @xmath44 has a unique decomposition of the form @xmath61 where @xmath53 and @xmath62 are themselves dyck words ( maybe empty ) . here , obviously , @xmath40 is the first letter of  @xmath44 , and @xmath41 is the letter coupled with it .",
    "the corresponding step in the dyck path is the descending step of the first return of the path to the horizontal axis .    in the same way ,",
    "every non - empty weighted dyck word @xmath44 has a unique decomposition of the form @xmath63 for some @xmath64 , where @xmath53 and @xmath62 are weighted dyck words .",
    "let @xmath65 be the formal sum of all the weighted dyck words , that is , the formal power series @xmath66 in non - commuting variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 stands for the empty word .",
    "( in order to write down a series we must choose a total order on the words .",
    "a particular choice of the order is irrelevant . in",
    ", the words are ordered according to their weight . )",
    "then , the above decomposition of the words of @xmath65 in the form @xmath63 implies the following equation for @xmath65 : @xmath70    now , do the following :    * replace each letter @xmath71 in @xmath65 by 1 ; * replace each letter @xmath72 in @xmath65 by @xmath73 ; * make the variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 commute .",
    "then , every word @xmath44 in @xmath65 is transformed into a word @xmath76 where @xmath22 is the number of occurencies of the letters @xmath72 , @xmath64 , in @xmath44 ( or , equivalently , the number of edges of the weighted tree @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath44 ) , and @xmath0 is the weight of @xmath44 ( or , equivalently , the total weight of @xmath77 ) .",
    "therefore , combining similar terms we get the generating function @xmath78 . at the same time",
    ", equation is transformed into the following quadratic equation for @xmath36 : @xmath79 solving this equation , and choosing the sign in front of the square root in such a way as to avoid a singularity at zero , we obtain formula  ( [ gf : b_m , n ] ) .",
    "then , substituting @xmath80 in ( [ gf : b_m , n ] ) we get ( [ gf : a_n ] ) .    in order to obtain the asymptotic expression for the numbers  @xmath16 it suffices to apply to  @xmath34",
    "the ready - made formulas of asymptotic analysis of the coefficients of generating functions  see , for example , @xcite , chapter vi .",
    "the only thing to note is that @xmath81    in order to prove , we proceed as follows .",
    "there are @xmath26 topological rooted trees with @xmath22 edges .",
    "starting at the root edge , we go around a tree in the clockwise direction and attribute a non - zero weight to every newly encountered edge .",
    "there are @xmath82 ways to do that .",
    "indeed , put @xmath0 dots in a row , and distribute @xmath83 separators among @xmath84 places between the dots .",
    "this procedure splits the number @xmath0 into @xmath22 non - zero parts .    in order to prove the recurrence ,",
    "consider separately the trees of weight @xmath85 having the root edge of weight  1 , and the trees of weight @xmath85 having the root edge of weight @xmath86 .",
    "the weighted dyck words corresponding to the trees of the first kind are of the form @xmath87 , where @xmath53  and  @xmath62 are themselves weighted dyck words .",
    "the sum of the weights of @xmath53 and @xmath62 is @xmath0 ; denoting the weight of @xmath53 by @xmath88 , so that the weight of @xmath62 becomes @xmath89 , and summing over the @xmath90 , we get the term @xmath91 of  .",
    "now , all the trees of weight @xmath85 having the root edge of weight @xmath86 are obtained from the trees of weight @xmath0 having the root edge of weight @xmath92 , by adding one unit to the weight of the root .",
    "this gives the term @xmath16 in the right - hand part of .",
    "finally , follows from the fact that there are @xmath22 choices of a root edge in a tree @xmath28 with @xmath22 edges , but if this tree has non - trivial symmetries then some of these choices produce isomorphic rooted trees .",
    "the number of non - isomorphic rootings is @xmath93 .",
    "thus , dividing by @xmath22 , we get the factor @xmath30 .",
    "theorem [ th : main ] is proved .",
    "let @xmath95 , @xmath96 be a partition of and integer @xmath0 .",
    "let us write @xmath97 in the _ power notation _ : @xmath98 so that @xmath99 is the number of the parts of @xmath97 equal to @xmath59 .",
    "denote @xmath100 the following theorem was proved in @xcite ( 1964 ) and later generalized in @xcite ( 1992 ) :    [ th : gj ] the number of rooted ordinary bicolored plane trees with the passport @xmath5 is equal to @xmath101 respectively , the number of the non - isomorphic ordinary bicolored plane trees with the passport @xmath5 , each one of them counted with the factor @xmath30 , is @xmath102 where the sum is taken over the the non - isomorphic ordinary bicolored plane trees with the passport @xmath5 .",
    "the above theorem is much more powerful than our theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "first of all , it gives an explicit formula ; and , what is more important , it enumerates the trees not according to one or two parameters ( as the weight and the number of edges in our case ) but according to their passport . in the weighted case ,",
    "a major difficulty in obtaining a similar formula stems from the fact that the same passport can be realized by a tree and by a forest , as one can see in a very simple example of figure  [ fig : forest - and - tree ] .",
