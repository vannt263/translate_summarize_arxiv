    "type i active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are defined by the presence of permitted lines with a kinematically distinct broad component , usually with full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the broad lines are emitted by gas in the broad - line region ( blr ) which is being photoionized by the central compact continuum source .",
    "detailed photoionization calculations yield rather tight constraints on the density , temperature , ionization level , and chemical abundances of the photoionized gas ( e.g. , ferland et al . 1998 ; hamann & ferland 1999 ) , while reverberation mapping techniques constrain the size and velocity field of the gas ( e.g. , peterson 2001 ) .",
    "however , the structure and origin of the photoionized gas in the blr remains a largely unsolved problem .",
    "the gas in the blr may be structured in small clumps ( hereafter `` clouds '' ) .",
    "a particularly appealing model is that of bloated stars , where the clouds are identified with the surface layers of supergiant stars , which are further bloated by the ionizing radiation field ( edwards 1980 ; scoville & norman 1988 ; penston 1988 ; kazanas 1989 ; tout et al .",
    "1989 ; alexander & netzer 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "this model is attractive because it relies on a relatively small modification of known objects ( supergiants ) , and it also provides a natural mechanism for the cloud confinement , although a self - consistent blr structure within this model appears problematic ( begelman & sikora 1992 ; krolik 1999 ) .",
    "alternative suggestions for the origin of blr clouds include gas streams produced by tidally disrupted stars ( hills 1975 ; roos 1992 ) , or by star - disk collisions ( zurek et al . 1994 ; vilkoviskij & czerny 2002 ) , or clumps in a gravitationally unstable outer disk ( collin & hur ' e 2001 ) .",
    "other scenarios invoke density inhomogeneities produced by wind interaction with nearby obstacles ( perry & dyson 1985 ) , such as stellar atmospheres ( torricelli - ciamponi & pietrini 2002 ) , supernova remnants ( pittard et al .",
    "2003 ) , or the the accretion - disk surface ( cassidy & raine 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested that the clouds are density enhancements produced by shocks in an accreting gas ( fromerth & melia 2001 ) .",
    "the physical viability of some of the proposed mechanisms remains unclear ( e.g. , mathews 1986 ; mathews & doane 1990 )    the other option for the blr structure is a smooth continuous flow , rather than a clumped flow .",
    "for example , this flow may be identified with the illuminated and photoionized accretion - disk surface ( e.g. , dumont & collin - souffrin 1990a , b ) .",
    "alternatively , it could originate in a wind driven off an accretion disk by radiation or magnetic pressure gradients ( shlosman et al .",

    "1995 ; chiang & murray 1996 ; bottorff et al . 1997 ) .      the minimum size of the photoionized clouds can be estimated from simple strmgren depth arguments .",
    "equating the h ionization rate to the recombination rate per unit area yields the column density of the photoionized h  ii layer , where most of the line emission is produced .",
    "this argument yields @xmath7  @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the ionization parameter , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are ( respectively ) the ionizing photon and the electron number densities .",
    "typical blr parameters are @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xmath14 , implying a typical thickness of the h  ii layer of @xmath15  cm ( although there may be a large range of @xmath16 values in the blr ; e.g. , baldwin et al .",
    "the equivalent widths of the h recombination lines imply that the blr gas covers @xmath17 of the ionizing continuum source ( e.g. , ferland et al .",
    "the photoionized gas could be made of clumps which are as small as @xmath16 , or it may reside in a thin photoionized surface layer over more extended bodies .",
    "the latter option is supported by the strength of some of the low - ionization lines ( e.g. , lines from fe  ii , ca  ii , na  i ) which originate in deeper layers at @xmath18 , where h is only partially ionized ( e.g. , ferland & persson 1989 ; baldwin et al .",
    "_ how can one then determine if the blr is clumped or smooth ?",
    "_    the number of clouds in the blr , @xmath19 , and their size , @xmath20 , can be constrained based on the smoothness of the emission - line profiles .",
    "the level of fluctuations in the emission - line profiles is proportional to @xmath21 , assuming the cloud velocities are randomly distributed within the line profile ( in proportion to the line flux ) .",
    "the solid area subtended by all the blr clouds is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radius of the blr ; since @xmath17 , we find that @xmath24 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy at a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) can place tight constraints on the level of fluctuations , which then translates into a large lower limit on @xmath19 , and thus a tight upper limit on @xmath20 , which may exclude some clumped blr models .",

    "this is the least luminous known seyfert 1 nucleus ( filippenko & sargent 1989 ; filippenko , ho , & sargent 1993 ) , and despite its extreme low luminosity , it appears to have a rather normal broad emission - line spectrum ( apparently with a lower than solar metal abundance , kraemer et al .",

    "( 2005 ; see their table 3 ) .",
    "bloated stars are predicted to have a size of @xmath1  cm ( alexander & netzer 1994 ) , and thus at most a handful of such stars can be accommodated in the blr of ngc  4395 .",

    "however , significant nonthermal broadening through radiation pressure ablation of the blr clouds , or through magnetic pressure effects , is likely and possibly inevitable .",
    "this broadening reduces the lower limit on @xmath19 ( e.g. , bottorff & ferland 2000 ; bottorff et al .",
    "2000 ) , and it may leave the bloated - stars idea as a viable option . as we show below , the bloated - stars idea can be conclusively ruled out in the compact blr of ngc  4395 , regardless of the velocity width of the lines produced by the individual clouds .",
    "the upper limit obtained is comparable to @xmath16 , strongly suggesting that the broad lines are produced by a smooth gas flow . in  2 of this paper",
    "we describe the observations and method of analysis , and the results are discussed in  3 .",

    "the first hires observation ( hereafter hires1 ) , described by filippenko & ho ( 2003 ) , was a 20 + 40 minute exposure obtained on 1994 april 14 ut , which yielded a s / n ranging from 20 per pixel at the continuum near h@xmath0  to 300 at the line peak .",
    "the second hires observation ( hereafter hires2 ) was a 30 + 60 minute exposure taken on 2002 february 4 ut , yielding a s / n ranging from 30 to 300 , as above .",
    "the esi observation was a 20 + 20 minute exposure made on 2002 december 2 ut , and the s / n ranges from 50 to 400 , as above .",
    "all of the spectra were reduced using the makee reduction software .",
    "cosmic - ray hits were manually removed from the spectra by comparing the two exposures available for each of the spectra .",
    "we did not use standard cosmic - ray removal tasks as they sometimes leave small residual features , which will affect the fluctuation analysis .",
    "we used a simple summation for the extractions rather than an optimal extraction in order to preserve the correct emission - line profiles , since an optimal extraction might produce incorrect results for the narrow - line profiles , and it could potentially produce small distortions in the broad lines as well .",
    "the rest - frame wavelength scale was converted to a velocity scale with respect to the rest wavelength of h@xmath0 , 6562.8   .",
    "we applied a slight offset to the velocity scale in each spectrum , such that the narrow h@xmath0  peak falls at @xmath40  km  s@xmath6  in all cases .",
    "we next subtracted a constant continuum level from each spectrum , in order to get the net line flux .",
    "absolute flux calibration is available only for the esi spectrum , and an arbitrary flux scale is used for the two hires spectra .",
    "the lack of an absolute flux calibration does not affect our analysis as we are only interested in the h@xmath0  profile shape here .",
    "the minimum number of clouds is estimated as follows .",

    "each line is further convolved with the instrumental resolution , approximated as a gaussian with fwhm = 8  km  s@xmath6  for hires , and 38  km  s@xmath6  for esi .",

    "this procedure provides us with an estimate of the minimum @xmath19 , as a function of @xmath45 , required so that the level of fluctuations produced by the finite number of clouds does not exceed the observed level of fluctuations ( produced by the flux measurement errors ) .    to obtain the smooth model fit , each line is fit with a spline function , where we iterate manually over the number and positions of the points selected for the spline fit , until the fit yields a reduced @xmath43 over the velocity range of @xmath482500  km  s@xmath6  to 2500  km  s@xmath6(or smaller , as set by the available spectra ) .",

    "[ ]  @xmath506548  in the spectra is @xmath51 , which agrees with the theoretically predicted value ] the [ ]  profile was also used as a guide for the expected shape of the narrow h@xmath0  component , and the broad h@xmath0spline fit was constructed to yield a narrow h@xmath0  profile similar ( but not identical ) to the [ ]  profile .",
    "this procedure allowed us to determine the velocity ranges affected by narrow - line contamination , which we find are @xmath52  km  s@xmath6@xmath53  km  s@xmath6 , @xmath54  km  s@xmath6@xmath55  km  s@xmath6 , and @xmath56  km  s@xmath6@xmath57  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we exclude these velocity ranges in the @xmath49 calculation .",
    "figure 1 displays the hires1 , hires2 , and esi h@xmath0  profiles , the smooth fits , and the residuals from the fit .",
    "achieving @xmath43 required about 14 spline points per spectrum .",
    "these were spaced about @xmath58  km  s@xmath6  apart close to the line core ( between the [ ]  lines ) , and about @xmath59  km  s@xmath6  or more apart in the line wings .",
    "the @xmath49 and the number of degrees of freedom obtained through the spline fit are 432/400 for esi , 1118/1446 for hires1 , and 688/812 for hires2 .",
    "thus , the fluctuations on scales smaller than the spline smoothing length are consistent with the level expected from @xmath44 .",
    "there is no evidence for significant intrinsic profile structure beyond pure noise .",
    "there are significant , though weak ( amplitude @xmath60% ) , features in the broad - line profiles close to the core on scales @xmath61  km  s@xmath6 , as indicated by small and non - monotonic changes in the smooth - fit profile curvature . at the wings the smooth fit appears featureless",
    "; however , since the s / n drops , such broad weak features would not be detectable there .    for the mc simulation , each one of the @xmath19 clouds",
    "is assumed to emit a line with a gaussian profile with the same total flux and velocity dispersion @xmath45 .",
    "the clouds differ only in their centroid velocity @xmath62 .",
    "we next need the velocity probability distribution function , @xmath63 , for the mc simulation .",
    "this @xmath63 should give @xmath64 in the limit of @xmath65 .",
    "as an estimate for @xmath63 we use the inverse function of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is set such that @xmath68 , as required for the integral of a distribution function ) , where @xmath69 is @xmath42 converted to a velocity scale .",
    "the use of an inverse function is a general procedure allowing one to transform a uniform random distribution from 0 to 1 ( generated by any standard random - number generator ) into any given normalized distribution ( @xmath69 here ; see also press et al .",
    "1992 , chapter 7.2 ) .",
    "the mc profile , @xmath47 , is generated by adding the contribution of the @xmath19 individual profiles , each one at its respective @xmath62 .",
    "the goodness of fit for each mc realization is measured by calculating the @xmath49 of @xmath47 , with respect to @xmath42 , using @xmath44 for the flux errors .",
    "since each mc realization yields a somewhat different value of @xmath49 , we performed 20 different mc simulations for each set of @xmath19 and @xmath45 values , and obtained the average value @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the dispersion of @xmath46 in the 20 simulations , which is used for verifying that @xmath70 is accurate enough ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) .",
    "a model was defined as acceptable if @xmath73 .",
    "the observed line profile is a convolution of the cloud velocity distribution function , @xmath63 , and the line profile produced by each cloud . above",
    "we have made the approximation that @xmath63 is proportional to the observed profile , and the accuracy of this approximation drops as @xmath45 increases .",
    "specifically , we find that for @xmath74  km  s@xmath6  ( @xmath75 ) the above procedure does not yield @xmath64 for @xmath65 . the simulated line peak becomes broader than the observed peak due to the effect of the convolution .",
    "another difficulty arises from the fact that the spline fit we use follows profile features on scales @xmath61  km  s@xmath6 , and thus features on this scales are filtered out of the observed residuals spectrum ( @xmath76 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a mc simulation of clouds with a given @xmath45 produces spectral features on a scale of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath45 , @xmath77 shows large - scale features , while such features do not exist in the observed residuals spectrum .",
    "these features can produce significant @xmath49 even for large values of @xmath19 . to overcome these two problems we added the following iteration .",
    "we took @xmath47 obtained for a specific simulation , and fit it with a spline ( using the same velocities used in the observed line fit ) , in order to get a revised estimate of @xmath42 .",
    "we now use the revised @xmath42 , to measure the @xmath46 of @xmath47 with respect to the revised @xmath42 .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates the effect of @xmath19 and @xmath45 on the level of fluctuations in the mc simulations , compared to the observed residuals ( shown for the hires2 spectrum ) . as expected , the simulated profile becomes smoother with increasing @xmath19 and @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath78  km  s@xmath6 , which corresponds to pure thermal broadening of @xmath79  k gas , the mc fluctuations are comparable to the observed ones for @xmath80 , while for @xmath81  km  s@xmath6 , @xmath82 is enough to produce fluctuations which are about comparable to the observed ones .",
    "a more quantitative measure of the fluctuations level is obtained by calculating the @xmath49 of the fluctuations , as mentioned above .",
    "figure 3 presents our derived limits on the minimum @xmath19 , as a function of @xmath83 , required to yield @xmath84 for the hires1/2 spectra and for the esi spectrum .",
    "the strongest constraints are provided by the esi spectrum , where the broad h@xmath0line happens to have the largest strength relative to the narrow h@xmath0  line . for @xmath78",
    "km  s@xmath6the minimum number of clouds required is @xmath85 ; this drops to @xmath86 for @xmath81  km  s@xmath6 , and to 3900 for @xmath87  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the solid lines in the plot follow the @xmath88 relation , expected from simple fluctuation arguments . and",
    "also @xmath89 , i.e. it is @xmath90 .",
    "the number of clouds in each velocity bin sets the fluctuation level in the spectrum .",
    "thus , at a fixed level of fluctuations , for example the one which corresponds to @xmath91 , one expects @xmath88 . ]",
    "the esi limits at @xmath92  km  s@xmath6  are nearly independent of @xmath83 because the convolution with the instrumental line profile ( @xmath93  km  s@xmath6 ) leads to a nearly constant line profile .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath19 fall below the @xmath88 relation at @xmath94  km  s@xmath6  in all spectra due to the profile smoothing procedure , which filters out large - scale profile structure .",
    "this effect is inevitable given the lack of _ a priori _ knowledge about the intrinsic line profile .",
    "we note , however , that when @xmath95  km  s@xmath6the simulated profile becomes distinctly different from the observed one .",
    "our limits are also subject to the assumption that all clouds produce similar line profiles .",
    "otherwise , any observed profile can be decomposed to any number of different profile components , but such an arbitrary decomposition appears implausible .",
    "we note in passing that the strongest constraint on @xmath19 ( that is , the largest contribution to @xmath46 ) comes from the observed fluctuations in the line core , rather than the wings ( cf .",
    "dietrich et al . 1999 ; ferland 2004 ) .",
    "this arises from the fact that the line flux density in the far wings becomes smaller than the continuum flux density ( here @xmath96 for @xmath52  km  s@xmath6@xmath97  km  s@xmath6  in hires1 , and for @xmath98  km  s@xmath6@xmath99  km  s@xmath6  in hires2 and esi ) .",
    "thus , the far - wings noise is dominated by continuum photons rather than line photons . since the continuum level is constant , the noise level is constant , and thus the observed s / n is @xmath100 ( put in other terms , the s / n in the far wings is background limited , rather than source limited ) .",
    "in contrast , the mc simulation fluctuations are anywhere proportional to the square root of the number of clouds contributing to a given bin , and so are @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the ratio of available s / n to the mc simulation fluctuations , which indicates the detectability of the predicted fluctuations , is @xmath102 ; i.e. it approaches zero at the wings .",
    "the earlier studies of arav et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) and dietrich et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have already ruled out the bloated - stars scenario based on the lack of the expected level of fluctuations in the line profiles . however , the fluctuation level is reduced if the line width generated by each cloud is much larger than the thermal width ( @xmath103  km  s@xmath6 ) , leaving the possibility of a clumped blr if @xmath104 .",
    "such a large @xmath45 may be produced by , for example , radiative ablation effects ( e.g. , scoville & norman 1995 ; pier & voit 1995 ) .",
    "the predicted level of fluctuations is @xmath105 . since @xmath106",
    ", the largest fluctuations are expected in objects with the smallest @xmath23  that is , in the lowest - luminosity objects . here",
    "we report on analysis of keck observations of the h@xmath0  profile in ngc  4395 , which is a factor of @xmath107 less luminous than the lowest - luminosity object previously analyzed ( ngc  4151 , arav et al .",
    "1998 ) , and is the lowest - luminosity type  i agn known by a significant factor ( compare with barth et al . 2004",

    "the balmer line emitting region is measured to be about twice as large as the @xmath109 emitting region in the few objects were both lines were measured ( korista et al .",
    "1995 ; onken & peterson 2002 ) , and comparison of the h@xmath0  and @xmath109 line widths suggests it could be as much as 5 times larger here , so one may expect @xmath110  cm for the h@xmath0  line .",
    "thus , if the bloated stars have @xmath111  cm ( alexander & netzer 1994 ) , then only a handful of them can fit in the blr of ngc  4395 , and this will produce large profile features , essentially regardless of the line width generated by each cloud . such a model is clearly ruled out by the observed smoothness of the h@xmath0  line , which implies @xmath112 for @xmath113  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the presence of @xmath111  cm stars at such a small distance from the black hole can also be ruled out based on tidal disruption arguments , as noted by alexander & netzer ( 1997 ) .",
    "a star with a mass @xmath114 and radius @xmath115 will be tidally disrupted once it crosses inward of @xmath116 . in ngc  4395 , @xmath117 ( peterson et al . 2005 ) , implying @xmath118 , and thus bloated stars , which presumably have @xmath119 , will be disrupted already at @xmath120  cm .",
    "stars which survive down to @xmath23 without being tidally disrupted need to be smaller than @xmath121  cm , or @xmath122 ; they can at most be red giants , or blue supergiants .",
    "a minimum population of @xmath123 such stars is required in ngc  4395 to produce the necessary blr covering factor ( using @xmath124 ) .",
    "such a population will have a bolometric luminosity of @xmath125  erg  s@xmath6 ( e.g. , table 3.14 of binney & merrifield 1998 ) , and its @xmath126-band magnitude will be comparable to ( or larger than ) the unresolved point - source magnitude measured by filippenko & ho ( 2003 ) . in any case , physical collisions will destroy such an extremely dense stellar system ( @xmath127  pc@xmath128 ) in a few dynamical times ( a few weeks ) .",
    "thus , a stellar origin for the blr clouds in ngc  4395 is ruled out both on theoretical grounds , and directly through the profile fluctuation analysis .",
    "the tidal disruption argument can also be used to place a lower limit on the density of any self - gravitating cloud at the blr , regardless of its size .",
    "a cloud of density @xmath129 and mass @xmath130 can avoid tidal disruption at the blr if @xmath131 .",
    "this gives a minimum number density , @xmath132  @xmath14 in ngc  4395 , about @xmath133 times larger than the density indicated by photoionization models ( kraemer et al .",
    "thus , any clumped emission - line gas in the blr will be subject to the strong shearing effect of the black hole gravity , which will stretch clouds by @xmath134 within one dynamical time .",
    "our lower limit on @xmath19 of @xmath3 implies @xmath135  cm , which is comparable to @xmath16 , the minimum size implied by photoionization models . since we do not have a robust indication here that @xmath136 , the blr gas may still be composed of clumps with the minimum acceptable size .",
    "however , it is not clear what mechanism can create , confine , and maintain such small individual clouds in a steady state ( e.g. , done & krolik 1996 ; krolik 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the most plausible scenario appears to be a smooth , or quasi - smooth , gas flow .",
    "reverberation mapping indicates that the blr balmer line velocity is dominated by gravity , and a pure inflow or outflow is excluded ( e.g. , peterson 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the only remaining velocity field appears to be a rotation - dominated flow , most likely in a geometrically thick configuration ( to subtend the required covering factor ) .",
    "direct evidence for an outflowing warm ionized gas is present in uv ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2004 ) and x - ray observations ( shih et al . 2003 ) , and this outflow may originate in the inner denser blr component .",
    "a rotation - dominated gas flow should produce double - peaked lines .",
    "such lines are indeed observed in agns with very broad lines ( e.g. , eracleous & halpern 2003 ; strateva et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the majority of agns show single - peaked lines .",
    "chiang & murray ( 1996 ) suggested that a sufficiently large radial velocity gradient can modify the line emissivity and produce a single - peaked emission line .",
    "however , lower optical depth lines , such as semi - forbidden lines and the higher h - series lines , should still show double - peaked structure , unlike what is generally observed .",
    "we note in passing that indirect indications for strongly blended `` hidden '' double peaks are provided by the rotation of the polarization angle across the h@xmath0  line profile observed in some objects ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ) , and by the distinct variability characteristics of the red and blue line wings observed sometimes ( e.g. , veilleux & zheng 1991 ; wanders & peterson 1996 ) .",
    "both effects were interpreted as evidence that the balmer lines originate in a rotating disk .",
    "the lack of a double - peak structure could be induced by a large velocity broadening mechanism in the blr , which makes the double peaks blend into a single peak , although the double - peak structure would still be discernible through the different polarization and variability characteristics of the two blended peaks .",
    "the two peaks appear to separate out in objects where the balmer lines are broad enough ( e.g. , strateva et al .",

    "<S> the origin and configuration of the gas which emits broad lines in type i active galactic nuclei is not established yet . the lack of small - scale structure in the broad emission - line profiles is consistent with a smooth gas flow , or a clumped flow with many small clouds . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive possibility for the origin of many small clouds is the atmospheres of bloated stars , an origin which also provides a natural mechanism for the cloud confinement . </S>",
    "<S> earlier studies of the broad - line profiles have already put strong lower limits on the minimum number of such stars , but these limits are sensitive to the assumed width of the lines produced by each cloud . here </S>",
    "<S> we revisit this problem using high - resolution keck spectra of the h@xmath0  line in ngc  4395 , which has the smallest known broad - line region ( @xmath1  cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> only a handful of the required bloated stars ( each having @xmath2  cm ) could fit into the broad - line region of ngc  4395 , yet the observed smoothness of the h@xmath0  line implies a lower limit of @xmath3 on the number of discrete clouds . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out conclusively the bloated - stars scenario , regardless of any plausible line - broadening mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit on the size of the clouds is @xmath4  cm , which is comparable to the size implied by photoionization models . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that gas in the broad - line region is structured as a smooth rather than a clumped flow , most likely in a rotationally dominated thick disk - like configuration . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains to be clarified why such a smooth , gravity - dominated flow generates double - peaked emission lines only in a small fraction of active galactic nuclei . </S>"
