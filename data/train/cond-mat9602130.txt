    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) has been observed in high mobility gaas-@xmath0as quantum structures at low temperatures and in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this effect produces quantized plateaus in the hall resistivity concurrent with minima in the longitudinal resistivity at special values of the electron density . a well formed electron correlation driven energy gap separating the ground state from the excited states occurring at these special densities and magnetic fields is the underlying reason for the fqhe phenomenon .",

    "theory @xcite of the fqhe , valid for filling fractions of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an odd integer , is based on the following two - dimensional ( 2d ) many - body wave function :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the complex representation of the @xmath6 electron s 2d position vector .",
    "the laughlin state describes a droplet of an incompressible correlated 2d electron liquid . at these special values of the filling fraction ,",

    "the geometry of choice in most numerical simulations is the translationally invariant , rotationally invariant spherical geometry @xcite . using just a small number of electrons , @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) can yield an accurate picture of the physical system . in this geometry ,",

    "if all of the electrons in the system are placed in the lowest landau level and the coupling between landau levels is ignored the resulting many - body problem is exactly soluble .",
    "the hilbert space is of finite dimensions and an exact finite dimensional hamiltonian matrix can be written down .",
    "this matrix can be diagonalized by standard techniques to find the energy eigenvalues and the eigenvectors .",
    "it is for this reason that exact finite size diagonalization has become such an important tool for studying the fqhe .",
    "in fact such numerical studies have been instrumental in confirming laughlin s many - body wave function @xcite .",
    "one direction that research in finite size diagonalization studies of the fqhe has taken is in increasing system size , _ i.e. _ increasing the number of electrons in the numerical simulation . in this paper , we take a different approach and place the emphasis on quantitatively improving the model used in describing the electron - electron interaction in the system to make it more realistic with respect to the experimental systems .",
    "historically the first studies of the fqhe used a pure 2d coulomb potential , and the pure @xmath23 coulomb interaction , where @xmath24 is the separation between 2d electrons , is still the most popular model for exact finite size diagonalization studies .",
    "it was later pointed out that the finite layer thickness in quantum structures would cause the short range part of the coulomb interaction to become softened . this could cause the ground state of the system to be no longer incompressible for very thick layers , and the fqhe may eventually be destroyed in thick layers .",

    "the fqhe has been studied using more sophisticated models for the electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "the most accurate approximation that one can make in this respect is to do a self - consistent electronic structure calculation within the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) to describe the interaction . in this paper",
    "we perform such a calculation for a wide parabolic quantum well ( pqw ) , a narrow square quantum well ( sqw ) , and a heterostructure , and we use the realistic lda electronic structure to compute the effective electron - electron interaction entering the exact diagonalization study .",
    "we use haldane s spherical geometry @xcite to do a fully spin polarized finite size fqhe diagonalization calculation for six electrons , which should be sufficient for our purpose .",

    ", we calculate the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of this fairly sparse fqhe hamiltonian matrix , following standard techniques .",
    "the overlap with the laughlin @xmath29 state is found by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix using the pseudopotential parameters appropriate for this state and then calculating the inner product between this state and the exact numerical ground state found using the lda pseudopotential parameters .",
    "the excitation gap is determined by looking at the size of the cusp at the relevant filling factor . in order to compare this calculated excitation gap to relevant experimental transport data",

    ", @xmath30 can be determined from    @xmath32    however , this equation is not quite correct @xcite for the single particle level broadening if the scattering is strongly peaked in the forward direction as it is in modulation doped gaas structures .",
    "we estimate the correct @xmath30 ( _ i.e. _ the single particle broadening ) using the transport data by employing a simple theory @xcite which accounts for this forward scattering correction .",
    "we then take the calculated excitation gap and subtract out @xmath33 when comparing with experiment .",
    "we begin with a description of the procedure for a self - consistent electronic structure calculation at zero temperature and in zero magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the effective mass and the static dielectric constant do not vary over the width of the quantum well and that interface grading and dielectric mismatch are negligible .",
    "we solve the effective - mass , single - particle effective schrdinger equation for a particle in a quantum well and poisson s equation for the electrostatic potential due to the free electric charge self - consistently .",
    "assuming separability of the planar and perpendicular degrees of freedom , the three dimensional schrdinger equation reduces to    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the subband wave functions and energies respectively , and the effective one electron potential energy @xmath37 is given by    @xmath38    with @xmath39 being the quantum well confinement potential , @xmath40 the self - consistent hartree potential , and @xmath41 is the exchange - correlation potential . for the bare confining potential of a quantum well of width @xmath42 , we take    @xmath43    with @xmath44 being the barrier height for a square quantum well and the barrier height above the edge of the parabolic portion for a parabolic quantum well , and @xmath45 is the curvature of the parabolic quantum well .    poisson s equation for the hartree potential",
    "is given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the background dielectric constant for gaas , @xmath48 is the electron density computed from the effective single particle subband wave functions and @xmath49 is the density of donor impurities .",
    "we do not include @xmath49 explicitly but include it via the boundary conditions in the solution of poisson s equation .",
    "the areal density is determined from the subband wave functions by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the occupancy of the @xmath52th subband and is given by    @xmath53    the chemical potential @xmath54 is determined by the relation    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the total surface density .",
    "the above equation is inverted to give @xmath54 and @xmath57 .",
    "many - body effects beyond the hartree approximation are included by means of the density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "a chief concern of density functional theory is the calculation of the exchange - correlation energy functional , @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "this functional of the electron density contains all those interaction parts of the energy functional which in general are unknown .",
    "the local density approximation consists of replacing the functional @xmath58 $ ] with a function @xmath59 whose value at a given point in space @xmath60 , where the density is @xmath61 , is determined as though the density was constant and equal to @xmath61 everywhere .",
    "the validity of this approximation requires that the variation of the electron density be small over distances of the order of a fermi wavelength .",
    "this condition is in general violated in most semiconductor quasi-2d systems .",
    "however , there is considerable evidence that this approximation when used in these systems gives excellent agreement with experiment @xcite . for the exchange - correlation potential",
    ", we used the parametrization due to hedin and lundqvist @xcite :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and    @xmath65    with @xmath66 and @xmath67 being the effective bohr radius and the effective rydberg respectively in gaas .",
    "the self - consistent procedure is to start with an initial guess for the electron density @xmath48 .",
    "the hartree and exchange - correlation potentials are then computed for this density .",
    "the schrdinger equation is then solved numerically to obtain @xmath68 and @xmath36 .",
    "a new density is then computed and compared to the previous @xmath48 through    @xmath69    if @xmath70 is larger than some specified tolerance , the new density is then mixed with the old density in the form @xmath71 where f is a suitably chosen number between zero and one .",
    "this density is used as input to the calculation and the procedure is iterated until @xmath70 is smaller than the tolerance . that is , convergence is achieved when the previous density and the new density do not vary much .",
    "the above procedure is correct for quantum wells . for a heterostructure @xcite",
    ", however , this procedure requires modification since @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the schrdinger equation takes the form    @xmath74    with @xmath37 still being given by equation  ( [ potential ] ) where @xmath75 is    @xmath76    poisson s equation for a position dependent dielectric constant is    @xmath77    the remaining pieces of the self - consistent calculation for heterostructures are unchanged from the quantum well case .",
    "the main uncontrolled approximation we are making in applying this lda procedure to fqhe calculations is the assumption that the applied external magnetic field does not appreciably affect the lda results . because the applied magnetic field is in the @xmath27 direction it is not unreasonable to assume that the single particle schrdinger equation in the @xmath27 variable is not substantially modified by the magnetic field .",
    "but we assume uncritically that @xmath41 has no magnetic field dependence , which should be a reasonable approximation for subband quantization arising from @xmath27 confinement .",
    "the basic ingredients entering the finite size fqhe diagonalization study are the coulomb pseudopotential parameters , @xmath78 , introduced by haldane @xcite .",
    "once all the @xmath78 s are known , the fqhe hamiltonian is completely defined .",
    "the pseudopotential parameters are the energies of pairs of particles with relative angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "they are given by @xcite    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the fourier transform of the electron interaction potential , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the landau level index . for small ( large )",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath78 describes the short ( long ) range part of the interaction .",
    "if the electrons are fully spin - polarized , then only @xmath78 with odd @xmath3 are relevant . for the density",
    "as determined from an lda calculation , where @xmath83 represents the density profile in the @xmath27 direction , the relevant equation for @xmath80 is given by    @xmath84    various approximations to the electron wave function in eq .",

    "the simplest approximation that one can make is to take the electron - electron interaction to be a pure 2d coulomb interaction . in this case ,    @xmath85    in order to take into account the effect of finite layer thickness in a quasi-2d electron system , a useful and simple approximation for the electron - electron interaction is @xcite the finite-@xmath26 model    @xmath86    where @xmath26 is the effective half - width of the electron layer in the @xmath27 direction and @xmath28 is the 2d position vector . in momentum space ,",

    "a major focus of our work is to determine how accurate these approximate models are when used in a fqhe calculation .",
    "in particular , pseudopotential parameters for these simple model approximations will be compared to those calculated using the self - consistent lda calculation .",
    "the eigenstates of a many - body hamiltonian are unchanged if the hamiltonian ( or the potential in the hamiltonian ) is shifted by a constant amount .",
