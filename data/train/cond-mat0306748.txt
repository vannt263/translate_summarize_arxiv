    "in recent years , experimental studies of biological macromolecules have motivated intense research in the field of statistical mechanics of single semiflexible polymer chains .",
    "indeed , studies like force - elongation measurements of different biological ( dna , titin , tenascin ) and synthetic ( polyethylene glycol , polyvinyl alcohol ) polymers using atomic force microscopes , optical tweezers and other recently developed tools are abundant@xcite .",
    "the measured force - elongation curve is generally fitted to the prediction of the wormlike chain model ( wcm ) of semiflexible chains@xcite , originally proposed by kratky and porod@xcite . from this fit ,",
    "parameters like the persistence length of the biopolymer are extracted .",
    "another kind of experiments has targeted the mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells@xcite .",
    "these properties are determined by an assembly of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton .",
    "this three dimensional assembly is made of the cytoskeletal polymers ( microtubules , actin filaments , etc . ) .",
    "all these polymers are semiflexible polymers at the relevant length scales ( a few microns at most ) .",
    "thus , the predictions of the wcm are very relevant for the understanding of the physical behavior of cytoskeletal polymers .",
    "the wcm was originally proposed by kratky and porod in 1949@xcite and reformulated using field theoretic methods by saito _",
    "et al_.@xcite in 1967 . in this model",
    ", the polymer chain displays resistance to bending deformations .",
    "this resistance is modeled using a free energy that penalizes bending the polymer backbone .",
    "the free energy depends on parameters ( elastic constants ) that are a consequence of many short - range monomer - monomer interactions .",
    "explicitly , the free energy is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the vectorial field that represents the polymer chain , @xmath5 is the arc of length parameter , @xmath6 is the contour length of the polymer and @xmath7 is the bending modulus . in addition",
    ", the local inextensibility constraint @xmath8 must be satisfied . as a consequence of the bending rigidity ,",
    "a wormlike chain is characterized by a persistence length ( proportional to the bending modulus ) such that , if the length scale is shorter than the persistence length , then the chain behaves like a rod while , if the length scale is larger than the persistence length , then the chain is governed by the configurational entropy that favors the random - walk conformations .",
    "the local inextensibility constraint has not allowed researchers to find an exact solution to the wcm .",
    "indeed , the constraint @xmath8 is written using a dirac delta distribution in infinite dimensions .",
    "depending on how the constraint is written , @xmath8 or @xmath9 , we get an edwards hamiltonian that is non - analytic or non - linear , respectively .",
    "consequently , there is no exact solution of this model at present .",
    "however , a few properties like the first few moments of the distribution of the end - to - end distance@xcite are known exactly .",
    "the aforementioned complexity of the wcm has motivated many approximate treatments of semiflexible polymers .",
    "for example , fixman and kovac@xcite developed a modified gaussian model for stiff polymer chains under an external field ( external force ) . in this approach , they computed an approximate distribution for the bond vectors from which they were able to compute the partition function and average end - to - end vector .",
    "an alternative approach was proposed by harris and hearst@xcite who developed a distribution for the continuous model from which they were able to compute the two - point correlation function and , consequently , the mean - square end - to - end distance and radius of gyration .",
    "another statistical property of interest has been the distribution function of the end - to - end distance or its fourier transform .",
    "many approximations for this function have been proposed .",
    "for example , different expansions of the distribution in inverse powers of the number of segments have been developed@xcite .",
    "similarly , perturbations with respect to the rodlike limit have been derived@xcite .",
    "other approaches to the distribution function of the end - to - end distance of semiflexible polymers have led to modified gaussian functions@xcite .",
    "finally , many approximations have been proposed for the structure factor@xcite .",
    "as stated in the previous paragraph , most of the approximate treatments of the distribution function of the end - to - end distance have been perturbative in nature .",
    "indeed , these approximations were perturbation expansions with respect to the flexible or rigid chain limits .",
    "a different approach to semiflexible polymers was taken by kholodenko@xcite . in this model , the euclidean version of the dirac propagator",
    "is used to predict the conformational properties of semiflexible polymers .",
    "in particular , the single chain structure factor has been used to describe experimental data quantitatively@xcite .",
    "recently , winkler has proposed another treatment of semiflexible polymers@xcite . in this work ,",
    "an approximate expression for the distribution function valid for any value of the stiffness of the polymer backbone was developed using the maximum entropy principle .",
    "motivated by the experimental studies done on semiflexible polymers and our incomplete understanding of the properties of the wcm , we have developed a new approach that captures many physical properties of the model , like the limits of flexible and rigid polymers , exactly and provides approximate crossover behaviors for all the distribution functions . to accomplish this goal ,",
    "we have employed a computational technique called the generalized borel transform ( gbt ) which was taken from quantum mechanics and quantum field theories@xcite .",
    "this method computes mellin / laplace transforms exactly .",
    "we provide a brief summary of this technique in appendix a.    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we evaluate the characteristic function of the wcm approximately such that some physical constraints are satisfied exactly . furthermore , we evaluate the distribution function ( polymer propagator ) using the gbt and compute the single chain structure factor . in section iii",
    "we discuss the results of our calculations which are valid for any value of the semiflexibility of the polymer .",
    "section iv contains the conclusions of our work and some speculations about applications to polymer physics of possible extensions of the gbt .",
    "the details of the mathematical calculations are presented in the appendices .",
    "consider a polymer chain modeled as a sequence of @xmath10 bond vectors @xmath11 connected in a sequential manner .",
    "in addition , let us assume that the length of each bond vector is @xmath12 ( = kuhn length ) and that pairs of consecutive bond vectors try to be parallel to each other .",
    "this preferential orientation is modeled with a boltzmann weight given by the following expression @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the strength of the interaction in units of thermal energy @xmath15 .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential_energy ] ) into the expression for the propagator of the random flight model@xcite , we obtain the following expression for the polymer propagator of semiflexible chains    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the end - to - end vector and @xmath18 is given by the formula    @xmath19    the propagator , eq .",

    "( [ eq : definition ] ) , is not normalized then the characteristic function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : caracprim ] ) , does not approach one when the wave vector goes to zero . instead , it approaches the canonical partition function of the model . furthermore , note that the characteristic function is a fourier transform in a @xmath24-dimensional space .    as stated before by yamakawa@xcite ,",
    "the exact evaluation of the characteristic function ( or the polymer propagator ) for semiflexible chains is not possible at present .",
    "therefore , we have developed a new approximation to evaluate this function .",
    "this new mathematical approach was developed in such a way that the most relevant physics of the problem is not altered by the approximation .",
    "specifically , the proposed approach keeps the thermodynamics ( partition function ) of the model exact",
    ". moreover , all the properties of fully flexible chains @xmath25 and infinitely stiff chains @xmath26 are preserved exactly .",
    "consequently , this approach captures both asymptotic limits exactly and provides an approximate description of the crossover behavior .",
    "in addition , our treatment of the problem uses the exact expression of the mean - square end - to - end distance .",
    "consequently , this quantity and the mean - square radius of gyration are exact . another important property of our approach is that it keeps the local inextensibility constraint intact .",
    "therefore , our chains have finite extensibility and this model can be used to compute the force - elongation relationship of semiflexible polymers .",
    "we describe our approximation hereafter .",
    "let us start by computing the following class of integrals    @xmath27    which are present in the characteristic function .",

    "consequently , we proceed to approximate it such that the asymptotic limits of flexible and stiff polymers are captured exactly .",
    "thus , the expression that we obtain will give an approximate crossover behavior between the aforementioned limiting regimes .",
    "note that in the limit of very stiff chains , @xmath49 , all the segments will be parallel to each other .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that rigid polymers have a larger radius of gyration than flexible ones for a fixed chain length .",
    "in addition , the decrease of the structure factor for large values of @xmath77 is faster for flexible polymers than for stiff ones . indeed",
    ", our computations predict that the structure factor goes as @xmath1 for large values of @xmath77 just before the plateau is reached . for values of @xmath10=5 , 10 and 30 , the values of @xmath2 that we got were 1 , 1.08 and 1.3 for @xmath14=10 ( rigid ) and 1.64 , 1.9 and 2 for @xmath14=0.33 ( flexible ) .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the fact that the structure factor of polymers with large chain length should scale as @xmath118 for large @xmath77 values where @xmath119 is the fractal dimension of the object ( 2 for a flexible polymer and 1 for a rigid polymer ) .",
    "consequently , these results imply that for short polymer chains ( @xmath120 ) , a value of @xmath121 is high enough to make this polymer behave like stiff rod , @xmath122 . on the other hand , as the chain length increases we observe that @xmath121 is not high enough to make the polymer behave as a rigid rod and deviations from the power law @xmath122 are observed . in the case of @xmath123",
    "our calculations predict that a value of @xmath10 equal to five is not high enough to recover the scaling behavior of flexible chains , @xmath124 .",
    "but , as the number of segments increases , the exponent approaches the value of two , indicating that the polymer chain behaves more and more like a flexible one .",
    "this result was also showed in figure 4 .",
    "the figures also show that the approximation we developed in the previous section gives a smooth crossover behavior from the rigid to the flexible limit .    in order to make the presentation of our work more balanced and objective ,",
    "we proceed to compare our results with the predictions of two other models .",
    "we start with our prediction for the single chain structure factor , @xmath125 , and compare it with the expression obtained by kholodenko@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that kholodenko s result can describe experimental data quantitatively@xcite .",
    "thus , a comparison between our expression for the single chain structure factor and kholodenko s will help us gauge the quality of the approximations used in our treatment of the wcm .",
    "figures 8 and 9 show the comparison for polymers with @xmath126 and two different values of the semiflexibility parameter ( shown in the plots ) .",
    "we have checked that other values of the parameters @xmath14 or @xmath127 and @xmath10 give quantitative agreements of similar quality . in all the cases studied we found that the relationship @xmath128 always gives excellent quantitative agreement between the predictions of both models .",
    "thus , our single chain structure factor should agree very well with the experimental data of ballauff and coworkers .",
    "still , since both models have different origins , some very small differences can be observed in the case of flexible chains ( figure 8) .",
    "we now proceed to compare our expression of the polymer propagator with the one computed by wilhelm and frey@xcite .",
    "figure 10 shows this comparison for the case of polymers with @xmath120 .",
    "the continuous curves are the results of our calculation with @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the dashed curves were constructed based on the work of wilhelm and frey where we adjusted the bending modulus such that the location of the peak in the propagator matched our results .",
    "this gives a better picture of the differences and similarities between both results .",
    "figure 10 shows quantitative agreement between both results when the stiffness is low . as the stiffness increases fig .",
    "10 shows that the qualitative behavior of both propagators is still the same .",
    "for example , both results predict that the location of the peak moves toward larger values of the end - to - end distance and that the distribution becomes narrower . the main difference between both results is quantitative in nature .",
    "our distribution becomes narrower than the one predicted by wilhelm and frey s work by a factor of two approximately which , in turn , generates a higher peak ( the distributions are normalized ) .",
    "finally , let us conclude this section by rationalizing the origin of the discrepancy between the propagators and the reason why this does not affect the structure factor significantly .",
    "we first note that differences in the propagators are to be expected because both , ours and frey s , calculations are based on different approximations and versions of the model ( continuum or discrete ) .",
    "let us now proceed to rationalize the origin of the discrepancy between both predictions .",
    "equations ( [ eq : distri ] ) and ( [ eq : structuralfactor ] ) define the polymer propagator and single chain structure factor in terms of the characteristic function .",
    "observe that the propagator is a fourier transform of the characteristic function .",
    "consequently , the oscillatory nature of the complex exponential generates partial cancellation of the contributions to the integral arising from different parts of the interval of integration .",
    "this cancellation magnifies any inaccuracies made in the approximation of the characteristic function .",
    "moreover , the consequences of this cancellation become more and more important as the polymer becomes stiffer because the characteristic function itself adopts an oscillatory behavior which , in principle , is out of phase with respect to the complex exponential .",
    "therefore , the stiffer the polymer is , the more important the consequences of the approximation become . on the other hand",
    ", the evaluation of the structure factor from the characteristic function does not involve any oscillatory function .",
    "consequently , any small inaccuracy made in the approximation of the characteristic function will remain small in the expression of the structure factor , as shown previously .",
    "the results obtained in this paper show that the generalized borel transform is a very useful computational tool for the statistical mechanics of single semiflexible polymer chains . indeed",
    ", the results presented in this paper clearly show that gbt is able to compute polymer propagators for single chain problems exactly .",
    "this capability of the technique is a direct consequence of its mathematical simplicity ( the gbt requires elements of basic calculus and some fundamental knowledge of complex variables ) .",
    "consequently , it does not add any mathematical complexity to the physics of the starting model .",
    "our analysis of the wormlike chain model was based on an approximate expression of the characteristic function .",
    "the exact evaluation of this function is not possible at present .",
    "therefore , we developed a new approximation that preserves the most relevant physical characteristics of the model intact . specifically , our approach keeps the thermodynamics of the model , the flexible and rigid limits , the mean square end - to - end distance and the finite extensibility of the model intact while providing an approximate expression for the characteristic function for intermediate values of the stiffness of the polymer chain . the polymer propagator was obtained exactly from the approximate characteristic function using gbt .",
    "note that the propagator is approximate not because of the gbt , which computes this quantity exactly , but because of the approximate nature of the characteristic function .",
    "our expression for the propagator shows a peak that shifts toward larger values of the end - to - end distance as the stiffness of the polymer backbone is increased , in agreement with other theoretical and computational treatments of the model .",
    "we also found that , in the low wave vector region , the structure factor decreases faster with increasing wave vector when the stiffness increases .",
    "this was rationalized in terms of the behavior of the radius of gyration .",
    "similarly , we found that , in the large wave vector region , the structure factor of flexible chains decreases faster than the one of rigid polymers .",
    "this was compared with the behavior of very long polymer chains whose behavior for large wave vectors is known exactly .",
    "we also compared of the predictions of our calculation with established results for the single chain structure factor and polymer propagator .",
    "excellent quantitative agreement was observed between our prediction for the single chain structure factor and the one predicted by kholodenko s model .",
    "the polymer propagator was compared with the prediction of wilhelm and frey .",
    "very good quantitative agreement was observed between the predictions of both models for low values of the stiffness . for stiff polymers , quantitative deviations",
    "were observed and the origin of the deviations was rationalized .",
    "the proposed approach to semiflexible polymers can also address semiflexible polymers with other topologies like ring and m - arm star polymers .",
    "the procedure should be similar to the one presented in this paper but , the characteristic function will have a different mathematical expression .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the characteristic function of the wcm which limits our ability to solve this model exactly .",
    "let us rewrite this function .",
    "the expression is    @xmath131    where we have replaced the wave vector @xmath28 by a group of wave vectors @xmath132 .",
    "this expression is the one of the characteristic function when all the @xmath132 are equal to @xmath28 .",
    "observe that if we replace @xmath132 by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the imaginary unit , then    @xmath135    which has the form of a laplace transform in @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "but , the gbt computes laplace transforms very accurately or even exactly .",
    "consequently , a generalization of gbt to many dimensions might lead to an exact or very accurate expression of the characteristic function of the wcm .",
    "this expression can be further used to compute the polymer propagator using gbt .",
    "thus , we speculate that such extension of the gbt technique might allow us to solve very accurately or even exactly the wormlike chain model . in general , such extension of gbt might allow us to solve other models of polymer chains of the form    @xmath136\\right)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath137 $ ] is the hamiltonian of the model .",
    "thus , helical wormlike polymers and other models might be mathematically tractable with this generalization of the gbt .",

    "let us briefly present the mathematical aspects of the gbt in connection with the computation of the laplace - mellin transform@xcite .",
    "we start with the expression    @xmath138    where we have explicitly extracted a factor @xmath139 from the function to be transformed .    defining the generalized borel transform ( gbt ) of @xmath140 as    @xmath141\\left[\\frac{1}{\\lambda\\eta}+1\\right]^{-\\lambda s}s\\left(g , a , n\\right)d\\left(1/\\eta\\right),\\quad re\\left(s\\right)<0\\label{borel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath142 is any real positive non - zero value and @xmath143 , we can invert eq .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a new approach to the discrete version of the wormlike chain model ( wcm ) of semiflexible polymers . our solution to the model </S>",
    "<S> is based on a new computational technique called the generalized borel transform ( gbt ) which we use to study the statistical mechanics of semiflexible polymer chains . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we evaluate the characteristic function of the model approximately . </S>",
    "<S> afterward , we compute the polymer propagator of the model using the gbt and find an expression valid for polymers with any number of segments and values of the semiflexibility parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this expression captures the limits of flexible and infinitely stiff polymers exactly . in between , </S>",
    "<S> a smooth and approximate crossover behavior is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> another property of our propagator is that it fulfills the condition of finite extensibility of the polymer chain . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the single chain structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> this property is a decreasing function of the wave vector , @xmath0 until a plateau is reached . </S>",
    "<S> our computations clearly show that the structure factor decreases faster with increasing wave vector when the semiflexibility parameter is increased . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the wave vector is large enough , there is a regime where the structure factor follows an approximate power law of the form @xmath1 even for short polymer chains . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is equal to two for flexible polymers and to one for rigid chains . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results to the predictions of other models . </S>"
