    "we assume that annihilation is not prevented in principle by dark matter not being its own antiparticle , or in practice by a large particle - antiparticle asymmetry .",

    "however , for smaller @xmath14 the unitarity limit is much less constraining .",

    "the unitarity and kkt bounds are also shown .",
    "the overall bound on the total cross section at a given mass is determined by the strongest of the various upper limits.,width=312 ]      unsurprisingly , the cross section bounds derived under the assumption of monoenergetic gamma rays are substantially stronger than those defined similarly for final - state neutrinos in bbm  @xcite and yhba  @xcite .",
    "( at the highest masses , near @xmath135 gev , this is no longer true , first because of how the numerical limits work out , and then because we do not presently have good gamma - ray data or limits at higher energies ; we expect that dedicated analyses by h.e.s.s . and",
    "other experiments will soon improve this . ) indeed , this was an assertion in those two works that we have now justified in more detail than before .",
    "it is unrealistic to have @xmath136 , of course , if one is trying to set a limit on the _ total _ cross section",
    ". if @xmath137 is known , then a limit on the total cross section can be determined by dividing the limit on the partial cross section to that final state by the branching ratio : @xmath138 in typical models , this branching ratio is typically @xmath139 or smaller  @xcite . to be conservative , we must just choose a value such that it is implausible that the true branching ratio could be smaller .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath140 , but this choice could be debated .",
    "as noted , our analysis uses wide logarithmic energy bins , and so , at the very least , would capture the gamma rays near the endpoint due to internal bremsstrahlung from charged particles  @xcite .",
    "( similarly , as a general point , limits on the total cross section defined by assuming only @xmath141 final states  @xcite would have to be corrected by dividing by @xmath142 . )",
    "figure  [ fig : sigmagg - fig3 ] summarizes various limits on the total cross section , including the one just described , the unitarity bound mentioned earlier , and the neutrino bound from yhba ( based on the milky way signal and the kravtsov profile ) . the standard cross section for a thermal relic",
    "is also shown .",
    "note that our limits bound @xmath21 directly , independent of whether @xmath143 is s - wave or p - wave dominated .",
    "these results , combined with those in our fig .  [ fig : sigmagg - fig2 ] , strongly constrain the possibilities for large dark matter annihilation signals , e.g. , as assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when shown in this way , it becomes clear how surprisingly strong the neutrino bound on the _ total _ cross section is , as it is comparable to the bound obtained using the gamma - ray flux limits and a reasonable assumption about the minimum branching ratio to gamma rays .",
    "it is very important to emphasize that while the gamma - ray bound on the partial cross section had to be divided by a realistic @xmath137 , this is _ not _ the case for the neutrino bound , as explained above .",
    "if we assume only sm final states , then all final states besides neutrinos lead to appreciable fluxes of gamma rays , and hence are more strongly excluded .",
    "of course , the gamma - ray and neutrino cross section limits can both be weakened by assuming an appreciable branching ratio to new and truly sterile particles .",
    "using gamma - ray data from a variety of experiments , we have calculated upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section to gamma rays over a wide range of masses .",
    "these limits are conservatively defined , in terms of our analysis criteria , our assumptions about the uncertain dark matter density profiles , and the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "while our results were nominally defined for monoenergetic gamma rays with @xmath12 , we have shown that all of our results except the integral line flux limit are only weakly dependent on this assumption .",
    "the limits obtained for more general gamma - ray spectra would only be somewhat less stringent .",
    "there are good prospects for improved sensitivity with present and upcoming gamma - ray experiments , particularly glast  @xcite and the tev act detectors .",
    "more detailed searches and analyses by the experimental collaborations themselves should also lead to improvements , which we encourage .",
    "these searches for dark matter signals are already background - limited , which will limit the possible improvements .",
    "glast and other experiments should be able to make reductions in the backgrounds by taking advantage of better energy and angular resolution , and by reducing the residual diffuse emission by subtracting astrophysical components and resolving individual sources .",
    "the high statistics expected for glast and other experiments should also make it possible to define detection criteria in terms of the uncertainty on the background , instead of the whole measured background .    using a conservative choice on the branching ratio to gamma rays , namely @xmath144 , we defined an upper limit on the _ total _ dark matter annihilation cross section by dividing our limits on the partial cross section to gamma rays by this branching ratio . at intermediate energies ,",
    "the upper limit on the total cross section defined this way is comparable to previous upper limits defined using neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the combined limit is considerably stronger than the unitarity bound  @xcite , or the cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite , which would lead to substantial modifications of dark matter halos . for the relatively large cross sections considered here ,",
    "the dark matter could not be a thermal relic ; additional work is needed to push the sensitivity of these and other techniques down to the expected cross section scale for thermal relics .    * acknowledgments : * we thank brian baughman , matt kistler , shmuel nussinov , sergio palomares - ruiz , and casey watson for useful discussions and comments .",
