    "consider a chain with ising variables @xmath2 that can take the values @xmath3 on @xmath0 sites .",
    "the ising model is described by the following action : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "this model has two degenerate minimum energy configurations . indeed , both the configurations @xmath6 , for every @xmath7 minimize the energy for this system with a value @xmath8 .",
    "every other configuration can be obtained by flipping the @xmath2 variables starting from either @xmath9 or @xmath10 : we see that flipping one variable costs an energy @xmath11 .",
    "we say that a variable is a _ kink _ if the adjacency variables have a different value .",
    "flipping an adjacent variable @xmath12 will not change the total energy of the system . however , if we flip a second variable @xmath13 with @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we create another kink , then the cost in energy will be @xmath15 .",
    "the total energy of a certain configuration @xmath16 will be given by @xmath17 , where @xmath1 is the number of kinks , not including the initial one .",
    "it is obvious that the two minimum energy configurations @xmath9 and @xmath10 are only separated by configurations that have energy @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , we can start from , say @xmath9 , pick a site @xmath18 and flip the variable @xmath2 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . in this way we keep staying in a configuration with energy @xmath11 .",
    "then , from there we can reach the configuration @xmath10 by flipping only adjacent variables .",
    "we say that kinks can propagate _",
    "freely _ , that is , without paying energy .",
    "the kink is made of the walls of a domain with all variables of the same value . in one dimension , making the domain larger does not change the domain walls . in statistical mechanics",
    ", this implies that the ising model in one dimension has a critical temperature @xmath21 . at every temperature @xmath22",
    ", some kinks will be created , and once created , a  kink can propagate freely and connect the two minima ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , at every @xmath22 , there is only one minimum energy configuration ; there are two only when @xmath21 .",
    "we call _ history _ the permutation on @xmath0 objects that indicate the sequence of the flips connecting @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "so , for instance , a history is given by the string @xmath23 in which we flip first the variable @xmath24 , then @xmath25 and so on . as we have pointed out",
    ", this history requires an energy @xmath11 . however , every time we create a kink , we pay an energy @xmath11 .",
    "the energy of a history is therefore the number @xmath26 , where @xmath1 is number of kinks created during the entire history , without including the first one .",
    "it is easy to compute the total number of histories : since we must flip @xmath0 ising variable , we can do it in @xmath27 possible ways , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of permutations of length @xmath0 . in the present paper",
    "we count the total number of histories given the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we exhibit generating functions for the sequences and observe that these numbers are asymptotically @xmath28 .",
    "our technique is the one of generating trees ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is related to all those models in condensed matter and statistical mechanics , where two minima are separated by excitations that can propagate freely ( or quasi - freely ) . even if the propagation is not free , _",
    "i.e. _ , if we add a tension  to the domains , there is a difference between propagating an excitation and creating a new kink @xcite .",
    "recently such a setting has become important again in the subject of topological quantum computation @xcite . in this context",
    ", we have quantum hamiltonians with deconfined quasi - particles .",
    "the quasi - particles are ends of strings .",
    "the quantum memory is encoded in the expectation value of large , topological observables in a degenerate ground state .",
    "a crucial problem is whether in this model quantum memory is stable for temperature higher than absolute zero @xcite .",
    "as soon as the temperature is greater than zero , some kinks will be created with some density of probability in time , and will start to propagate . if the total time to connect two degenerate ground states will scale with the size of the system , the quantum memory will be considered robust , otherwise it will be considered fragile .",
    "a precise computation will require a knowledge about the number of all possible histories for this process .",
    "we will deal with a purely combinatorial framework .",
    "let us consider a network modeled by a chain with a finite number @xmath0 of nodes",
    ". in the network , the first node is adjacent to second one ; the second to the first and the third one , and so on .",
    "to begin with , let us assume that there is a unique node of the network having a special property .",
    "for example , the node possesses some information , which has to be _ diffused _ to the entire network .",
    "when the clock ticks , the node passes the information to one its neighbors .",
    "the process carries on , and at each time step , a single node passes the information .",
    "it is clear that it takes exactly @xmath0 time steps for the information to be transferred to the entire network .    in how many different ways this can be done ?",
    "summing over all possible initial nodes , the answer to this question is @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to the case with a single kink introduced at the beginning of the process . in figure",
    "[ figs ] represented all the @xmath30 possible different histories , when the number of nodes is @xmath31 ( see the vertices @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the time steps of the diffusion are represented from left to right . in this case",
    "@xmath36 because the only kink is the initial one .    following the above description ,",
    "let us now consider a variant in which we introduce extra kinks .",
    "again , at each time step a single node passes the information , as we have seen before .",
    "we assume however that during the process there are exactly @xmath1 nodes acquiring the information not from an adjacent node .",
    "additionally , these special nodes are not pairwise adjacent to each other .",
    "the total number of ways in which the information can be propagated to the entire network is the number of histories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the notation and formalize the problem ; in section 3 we state and prove the results .",
    "section 4 is a brief conclusion .",
    "the graph @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and edges @xmath39 , is called @xmath0__-path__. we will define below a procedure to assign labels to the vertices of @xmath0-paths . the procedure will satisfy the specific conditions , giving the diffusion dynamics which we have described in introduction . for each integer @xmath40 , we define a function @xmath41 .",
