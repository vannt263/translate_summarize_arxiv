    "the submillimeter surveys of the last five years , using the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) and the max - planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) @xcite have revealed a population of high - redshift objects which play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "though relatively rare ( @xmath20.5 arcmin@xmath3 at @xmath4 3 mjy ) these systems have extreme individual luminosities ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 l@xmath7 ) and are responsible for @xmath2 20% of the far - infrared background at 850  ( to @xmath8 3 mjy ) @xcite .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the relative unimportance of similar far - infrared bright galaxies in the local universe ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) , and indicates substantial evolution in this population with redshift .",
    "the high star formation rates of these galaxies of @xmath2100 - 1000 m@xmath7/year , are sufficient to produce a massive galaxy over a dynamical timescale , and make them strong candidates for the progenitors of local elliptical galaxies",
    ". however , there are still many unanswered questions regarding the nature of these objects , their redshift distribution , and their relationship to other high - redshift populations .    a key issue , but one of the hardest to address , is the nature of the obscurred energy source .",
    "determining the fraction of energy produced by star - formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is crucial for understanding how these systems fit into theories of galaxy evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "though a number scuba sources which have been studied in detail show signs of agn activity , and indeed , all scuba sources may be home to obscured agn , the current evidence points toward star - formation dominated systems @xcite .",
    "even once the relative contribution of an agn to the submillimeter flux is known , inferring a star formation rate is still difficult .",
    "the primary uncertainty results from the poorly understood dust temperature in these systems and though we may attempt to calibrate this using @xmath90 ulirgs @xcite , there is growing evidence that these local objects may not be representative of the high - redshift scuba sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an understanding of the energy production and radiation mechanisms in these systems will require extensive follow - up observations , with a level of detail similar to those of @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite for many systems .",
    "the speed with which we can carry - out these observations is limited by current technology but this will change dramatically with future facilities such as alma , jwst , and the lmt .    though these systems certainly have sufficient star formation rates to rapidly form an elliptical galaxy , it is less clear that their spatial density ( e.g. @xcite ) and clustering properties @xcite are consistent with local massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "this would be an evolutionary link between the two populations , but requires a complete determination of the redshift distribution , and in particular , for a measure of the clustering strength , significant sky coverage .",
    "such measurements would also shed light on the relationship between these objects and other high - redshift populations .",
    "though the lyman - break galaxies have very little direct overlap with the bright submillimeter population ( @xmath10 3 mjy ) , they are likely present at significant numbers in the fainter @xmath11 counts @xcite .",
    "there is also tentative evidence that the lbgs and scuba sources may trace the same large scale structure @xcite , perhaps forming a mass sequence in which scuba sources represent the most massive star forming systems at high - redshift@xcite , or alternatively , they may be related through time , as systems evolve from a dusty , luminous stage of intense star formation though a relatively dust - free and perhaps extended phase of moderate star formation . @xcite .",
    "the determination of the redshift distribution is hindered by the uncertainties in the source positions , due relatively large beam size of the jcmt at 850 .",
    "positions are generally secured through radio detections which biases the measured redshifts to @xmath12 3 @xcite .",
    "a further possible complication is the different flux limits reached by different surveys , ranging from the sub - mjy limits of the cluster surveys @xcite to the very bright ( @xmath13 8mjy ) limits of the 8 mjy survey @xcite .",
    "there are indications that the brighter scuba sources may lie at predominantly higher - redshifts than the fainter systems @xcite .",
    "if so , relatively deep surveys such as this one would be biased to lower - redshift sources compared to shallower programs such as the `` 8 mjy survey '' @xcite .",
    "the resolution of all of these issues requires the careful and extensive follow - up of a wide variety of sources , over a range of flux levels and selection techniques .",
    "unfortunately , the first step of identifying the optical counterparts of these systems is not trivial and many scuba sources catalogued in current surveys have no solid identification @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the uncertainty in the submillimeter positions and the faint and red nature of these objects at optical wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , more than one candidate identification often lies within a given submillimeter error radius .",
    "even once counterparts have been securely identified they are typically so faint that optical and near - ir spectroscopic redshifts can only be measured with 8-m class telescopes ( if at all ) and large investments of observing time are required ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "this situation will improve with the commissioning of facilities which will measure redshifts through masers , co lines , and far - ir photometry , and will not require bright optical / nir counterparts @xcite    it is because of the empirical correlation between radio and far - infrared flux @xcite , and the excellent resolution of large radio arrays , that radio mapping currently offers the best chance to secure positions of the sources",
    ". moreover , the extremely low surface density of radio sources makes chance coincidences between the radio and submillimeter populations highly unlikely .",
    "unfortunately , at the current typical flux limits radio detections are biased to redshifts of z @xmath14 2 - 3 and , depending on the redshift distribution of the scuba sources , may miss a substantial fraction of the population @xcite .",
    "nir imaging is crucial as these objects may be expected to be very red due to the presence of dust ( but also see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a significant fraction of scuba sources have been associated with extremely red objects ( eros ) or very red objects ( vros ) @xcite .",
    "as in the radio , the relatively low surface density of red objects , compared to optically selected populations , reduces the frequency of chance positional coincidences .    in this paper",
    "we explore the multi - wavelength properties and redshift distribution of submillimeter sources detected in the canada - uk deep submillimeter survey ( cudss ) .",
    "we present the identifications for sources in the 14field and discuss the properties of the entire catalogue . here",
    "we briefly re - cap the previous papers which have resulted from this survey .",
    "the submillimeter data are discussed in detail in @xcite ( papers i and iv ) and @xcite ( paper vi ) .",
    "the first identifications were presented in @xcite ( paper ii ) .",
    "one of our brightest sources cudss 14.1 , which has been observed extensively at other wavelengths , is discussed in @xcite(paper iii ) .",
    "a discussion of the submillimeter properties of lyman - break galaxies in the survey fields may be found in @xcite ( paper v ) .",
    "the optical / nir identifications of the 3field are presented in clements et al ( in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we outline the multi - wavelength data which we , and others , have obtained over this field area .",
    " 3 explains our procedure for identifying counterparts and presents the identifications . in ",
    "4 we discuss the properties of individual sources . in",
    " 5 contains a discussion of our results in detail .",
    "finally , in  6 we summarize our results .",
    "we assume a flat , @xmath15=0.7 cosmology and h@xmath16=72 km / s / mpc throughout .",
    "the cudss survey consists of two primary fields : the 14field ( 48 arcmin@xmath17 ) and the 3field ( 60 arcmin@xmath17 ) .",
    "these fields are contained within the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) fields cfrs14 + 52 and cfrs03 + 00 respectively .",
    "the submillimeter data were obtained using scuba on the jcmt over many observing runs from 1998 to 2001 .",
    "the details of the submillimeter observations are discussed in papers iv and vi .",
    "paper vi also contains the complete 3field catalogue of 27 sources .    in paper",
    "iv we presented a source catalogue for the 14field of 19 objects with @xmath18 3 . since then we have acquired new submillimeter data , primarily located on the upper strip of the field which , previously , had not been imaged to the same depth as the rest of the field . through the addition of these data four new sources were detected , all at @xmath19 3 .",
    "these new observations marked the completion of the submillimeter survey of this field and we now present our final catalogue in table 1 . note that sources 14.1 through 14.19 are identical to the sources listed in paper iv .",
    "most of the @xmath20 field has been mapped at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz by fomalont et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to a depth of @xmath21jy and 2.5 @xmath0jy , respectively .",
    "data at 1.4 ghz also exists for the 3field ( yun personal communication ; ivison personal communication ) and was discussed in paper vi . taking advantage of the improved wide field imaging algorithms in the aips software system , m. yun re - calibrated the archival vla data by fomalont et al . and obtained a new continuum image with about twice the improved resolution ( @xmath22 ) using a robust weighting of visibilities .",
    "the final dynamic range limited noise in the 14image is @xmath23jy , similar to that of fomalont et al . as a comparison to other surveys",
    "we note that the ratio of the submillimeter to radio 1@xmath24 noise level ( per beam ) in this survey is 1mjy/14@xmath0jy @xmath2 70 , while for the hdf it is 0.4mjy/7.5@xmath0jy",
    "@xmath250 @xcite and for the 8 mjy survey it is 2mjy/4.8@xmath0jy @xmath2 400 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the improved angular resolution , completely different noise characteristics and a different treatment of a serious imaging problem make the examination of the newly reduced 1.4 ghz image worthwhile . because these vla observations are done in the continuum mode , both the 1.4 ghz and the 5 ghz images suffer from beam smearing ( chromatic aberration ) ",
    "cross - correlation of signal with different wavelengths with the bandpass causes a loss of amplitude and displacement of source position in a radial direction from the phase center ( see bridle & schwab 1988 ) .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for the scuba sources because they are located mostly outside the central 150 region which is relatively problem - free .",
    "fomalont et al .",
    "dealt with this problem by summing all flux over the radially elongated source regions ( e. fomalont , private communication in 2000 ) . recovering the total flux this way",
    "requires summing over more than one beam areas ( thus increasing noise ) and may not fully account for the amplitude de - correlation .",
    "instead , we have measured the peak amplitudes from the image and then recovered the source flux using the correction factor that depends on the radial distance from the phase center using eq .  13 - 24 in bridle & schwab",
    "the new location and the recovered flux density for the scuba sources in the 14@xmath25 field are given in table  [ radiotab ] .",
    "the new 1.4 ghz image does not yield any new detections of the scuba sources within the search radius of 8 , but we can derive a more accurate upper limits after properly taking into account the effects of beam smearing .",
    "both scuba fields have been imaged by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "the data covering the 14field at 7  and 15  are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the data covering the 3field are not yet published and have been provided to us by hector flores .",
    "the cfrs fields have been extensively studied at optical wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the original @xmath26 photometry and spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath27 1.3 ) of the cfrs itself @xcite , hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xmath28 imaging was undertaken for cfrs morphology follow - up work and further archival observations were available ( see footnote 1 , first page ) .",
    "as part of follow - up work for this survey we acquired three new @xmath29-band hst pointings for each cudss field .",
    "these data were reduced and calibrated using the general hst reduction pipeline and reach an @xmath30 depth of @xmath226.0 mags .",
    "these data , combined with the existing hst data described above , cover 19/23 objects in the 14field , and 19/27 objects in the 3field .",
    "the @xmath31-band imaging of the cfrs was extremely shallow and covered only 1/3 the cfrs fields fields .",
    "thus , we obtained new @xmath31-band imaging using irim on the mayall-4 m at kitt peak and using the cfhtir camera on the cfht .",
    "the cfhtir data have better pixel resolution than the irim data , with 0.207 arcsec / pixel , versus 0.6 arcsec / pixel , as well as improved sky quality .",
    "the kitt peak data reach a depth of @xmath3221.5 mags and the cfhtir data reach @xmath3222.5 - 23.0 mags , over most of the image .",
    "both data sets cover roughly 2/3 of the 14and 3fields .",
    "we have chosen a method which selects counterparts on the basis of positional coincidence ( @xcite ; paper ii ) as follows . the probability that an object , physically unrelated to a given scuba source , will lie within a distance @xmath33 of said",
    "source can be described by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the surface density of galaxies as bright or brighter than the candidate identification .",
    "defined in this way , the lower the @xmath36 value , the higher the statistical significance of the identification .    as pointed out in paper ii , using the surface density of objects as bright or brighter than the candidate identification inherently underestimates the probability of random associations .",
    "this is because one effectively searches many independent galaxy samples simultaneously , and the chance that one of these samples will produce an identification of high significance is increased .",
    "we must , therefore , calculate a new quantity @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is determined from monte - carlo simulations of our identification procedure .",
    "we use randomly chosen positions in place of real scuba positions , which yields an empirical estimate of the probability of finding a galaxy of a given magnitude and color within the search radius of a random position .",
    "these @xmath39 values should be interpreted in the following way .",
    "if we assume that scuba sources are completely unrelated to the optical / near - ir population within which we search for identifications , we would statistically expect to select 10 identifications with @xmath40 0.1 for every 100 scuba sources .",
    "thus , @xmath39 for a single identification should be interpreted with respect to the entire sample , rather than in isolation .",
    "we have empirically estimated our search radius by placing and recovering fake scuba sources in our submillimeter map , and through monte - carlo simulations of the data ( paper iv ) .",
    "we found the positional offset between the measured position of an object and its true position was @xmath41 8   90 - 95% of the time , and therefore we use this as our search radius .",
    "this is a larger search radius than used by some groups ( e.g. @xcite ) though we note that the peak of our offset distribution lies at a smaller radius of 2 - 4  ( also see @xcite ) .      in paper",
    "iv we presented five radio identifications for the 14field and these are listed in table [ radiotab ] , along with their @xmath36 statistics . at these levels of significance",
    "we do not expect any of these five identifications to be the result of random scuba - radio associations . in table",
    "[ radiotab ] we also include a possible radio counterpart for source 14.19 which lies beyond our search radius . as we expect 1 - 2 identifications ( for our sample size ) with offsets from the scuba position of @xmath5 8 , this identification should be considered but is by no means secure .",
    "the iso identifications were also discussed in paper iv and are summarized in table [ isotab ] .",
    "three sources have been detected in the mid - ir , two of which ( 14.13 , 14.18 ) are also coincident with radio emission .",
    "the third detection ( 14.17 ) has a very large offset ( 10.3 ) and is therefore not a secure identification .      in paper",
    "ii the identifications were chosen from an @xmath29-selected population . in this work",
    "we have improved our algorithm by including @xmath31 information as follows . for a given @xmath31-selected galaxy within the positional error radius of a scuba source we compute the surface density of galaxies as bright or brighter than its @xmath31-band magnitude and as red or redder than its @xmath42 color , directly from our cfhtir mosaic image and the cfrs optical data . because we estimate this directly from the follow - up data field - to - field variations in density are taken into account .",
    "using the @xmath42 color is advantageous for two reasons : ( 1 ) since red galaxies have a lower surface density than galaxies of more moderate color the chance of random coincidences is decreased , and ( 2 ) because scuba sources are by their nature very dusty we may begin with the reasonable assumption that they have redder colors than the typical galaxy .",
    "this second point is somewhat contentious since bright submillimeter flux does not necessarily guarantee red optical / nir colors .",
    "in fact , @xcite has shown that some low - redshift ulirgs have surprisingly blue optical colors when placed at high - redshift .",
    "@xmath39 was calculated for each @xmath31-selected galaxy within 8   of each scuba source .",
    "this was done blindly with respect to the radio and mid - infrared data .",
    "all 23 scuba sources had at least one candidate identification within their submillimeter error radius ( i.e. there were no demonstratable `` empty fields '' ) , and there were typically 1 - 3 possibilities .",
    "table [ idtab ] lists the best identification ( i.e. the one with the lowest @xmath39 value ) for each source .    in figure [ pplot ]",
    "we plot a histogram of the  values for the scuba identifications ( solid line ) and for the monte - carlo simulations of our identification procedure ( dashed line ) .",
    "an excess of real identifications with @xmath41 0.1 over the number predicted by the monte - carlo simulation is apparent .",
    "statistically we expect two random associations at this level of significance but our procedure has selected seven .",
    "this implies that on order five of these seven sources are correctly identified .",
    "one might expect that the addition of radio information to the nir data would solidify a number of ambiguous identifications , but we find this is not the case . of the seven nir - selected identifications with @xmath43 0.1 , five of them",
    "are the same identifications selected by radio detections .",
    "that is , _ given only the nir data our identification procedure securely identifies the same objects that are identified using radio data_. therefore , at these flux limits ( 14 @xmath0jy ) the radio data do not greatly improve the identifications over the nir data .",
    "in particular it does not identify objects missed by the nir algorithm .    between @xmath2 0.1 and @xmath2 0.5",
    "there is still an excess over random but it is less pronounced , only @xmath2 3 sources .",
    "thus , in this region it is reasonable to expect a number of correct identifications but there are at least as many , and probably more , random associations .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to know which specific identifications are correct simply based on the @xmath39 value .",
    "one might worry that our identification algorithm will be overly biased toward red identifications but this appears to have a negligible effect . in figure [ colmag_n ]",
    "we show the magnitudes and colors of the identifications selected when the algorithm is run with random positions in place of scuba positions . in this case",
    "the best identifications posses a wide range of magnitudes and colors and are not concentrated in the region in which the good scuba identifications are located .",
    "there is a small offset towards redder average color for a given magnitude but this is not large enough to account for the unusually red colors of the statistically secure identifications . also shown in",
    "figure [ colmag_n ] are the colors and magnitudes of the monte carlo identifications found when we modify our identification algorithm to be biased toward blue objects , rather than red .",
    "again , the colors of the selected identifications span a wide range of values and are only offset by a small amount from the color of the general field population .",
    "this field has also been surveyed for lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) by two groups : steidel and collaborators ( personal communication ) and the canada - france - deep - fields survey ( cfdf ) ( @xcite ; foucaud et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the statistical submillimeter properties of the lbg population within the cudss fields has been explored by @xcite , who also discuss the two lbg samples in detail . in this work",
    "we will limit the discussion to scuba sources with possible lbg counterparts .    as with red galaxies and radio sources lbgs have low surface densities and are therefore less likely",
    "to be randomly associated with scuba sources .",
    "there are five lbgs within 8  of a scuba source and these are listed in table [ lbgid ] . however , one of these is within the error radius of source 14.9 and , as 14.9 is securely identified with a radio source , the lbg is clearly a positional coincidence .",
    "the remaining lbg identifications are not secure for the following reasons . given the @xmath36 values of the cfdf lbg identifications we would expect about one random association .",
    "there are two ( sources 14.6 and 14.9 ) and therefore based purely on this one could conclude that 14.6 is properly identified with an lbg .",
    "however , as this is only an excess of one object over that expected randomly it is not statistically significant .",
    "the @xmath36 values of the steidel et al .",
    "identifications are all too high to be considered secure . at these levels of significance",
    "we would expect two such identifications randomly and we have three .",
    "again , this is an excess of only one object of the number expected randomly and well within the shot noise .    to estimate the @xmath36 statistic for these objects the surface density of lbgs over the entire survey field",
    "was used but , in fact , these four objects are found amongst the densest concentration of lbgs in this field .",
    "this could have a number of interpretations .",
    "it is most likely these identifications are simply chance coincidences occurring with greater frequency because of the higher surface density of objects in this region .",
    "however , submillimeter sources have been associated with regions of optical over - densities @xcite and indeed , this small area within the survey field also contains the highest concentration of scuba sources in our survey .",
    "perhaps more lbgs in this region are submillimeter bright because of high - density environment effects , or this area is an over - dense region in real - space where the scuba sources and lbgs are clustered together but not physically the same objects @xcite .      in this section",
    "we consider four positional offset distributions of interest .",
    "these distributions are shown in figure [ off ] and discussed below .",
    "1 .   figure [ off](a ) .",
    "the offsets derived in the monte - carlo simulations of the identification procedure .",
    "these are the offsets between the random positions chosen from the @xmath31-image and the best `` fake '' identification chosen for each random position .",
    "this is the distribution that the incorrect identifications will follow .",
    "these are not uniformly distributed , but peak at 7 , with very few at low offsets .",
    "2 .   figure [ off](b ) . the distribution of offsets between the measured and true positions of objects in the submillimeter data due to the effects of noise and confusion",
    "these are the offsets that the real scuba sources and their true counterparts would be expected to follow .",
    "as outlined in  3.1 and paper iv , this was estimated through simulations of the submillimeter data .",
    "this distribution peaks at @xmath22 - 3  with an extended tail to large offsets .",
    "3 .   figure [ off](c ) .",
    "the offsets between the submillimeter positions of the real scuba sources and their best nir - selected identification .",
    "clearly this distribution will be a superposition of the above two distributions , ( a , b ) , as the identifications are a mixture of true counterparts and incorrect identifications .",
    "indeed , if one compares figure [ off](c ) with figure [ off](a ) , an excess of offsets at @xmath44 5  is evident .",
    "the magnitude of this excess is roughly equal to the excess number of objects over random found by the nir identification algorithm ( figure [ pplot ] ) .",
    "4 .   figure [ off](d ) . the offsets between the submillimeter positions and the radio positions for the scuba sources detected in the radio",
    "these are secure identifications and thus these offsets mirror the offsets of ( 2 ) . to clearly show the distribution we have included the radio sources from both cudss fields ( see paper vi ) .",
    "below we discuss the properties of individual identifications . based on the reasoning discussed in the previous sections we have divided our sample into three identification categories : ( 1 ) those with radio detections ( all but one are considered secure ) , ( 2 ) those with plausible identifications and , ( 3 ) those with ambiguous or poor identifications .",
    "in the following discussion we define an ero as objects with @xmath45 2.7 4.0 ] and a vro as objects with @xmath45 2.2 .",

    "we expect 5 - 10% of the sample to have identifications that lie beyond 8 and so this identification is possible but by no means secure .",
    "a second possible identification is found with the nir identification algorithm , which lies at a smaller offset of 3 but is not statistically significant .",
    "the sources discussed in this section do not have radio detections .",
    "however , we know that a number of the non - radio sources have been correctly identified (  3 ) though it is not possible to know which ones simply based on their  values . in the following we discuss three sets of identifications :",
    "the possibility that a significant fraction of scuba sources in blank - field surveys could be lensed by foreground objects was first discussed by @xcite before the commissioning of scuba . since then , a number of scuba sources that were ( or would be ) identified with relatively nondescript low - redshift galaxies , based on positional coincidence arguments , have , upon further study , turned out to be more distant objects , possibly magnified by the foreground object which was originally thought to be the identification @xcite .    in our own survey",
    "there are a number of sources whose best identification is with a low - redshift system ( @xmath58 1 ) , two in the 14field ( 14.11 and 14.18 ) and four in the 3field ( 3.8 , 3.10 , 3.15 , 3.25 ; @xcite ) .",
    "since none of these identifications have been verified through the detection of co it is possible that all six are incorrect .",
    "if so , their close proximity to the scuba positions may be the result of lensing .",
    "however , the available evidence suggests this is not the case but rather that we have located the correct identification for all but one of these objects .    these systems , with the with the exception of source 3.25 ( which is faint , small and diffuse , and source 14.11 , which is bright , large , and spheroidal ) exhibit unusual morphology suggestive of merger activity .",
    "five of the six sources ( all but 14.11 ) have detections at 1.4ghz , coincident with the optical identification , and four of these ( all but 3.25 ) have also been detected at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "these detections strengthen the statistical argument that these objects have been correctly identified since the surface density of radio and iso populations is relatively low .",
    "more importantly , these are exactly the signatures we would expect for lower redshift objects .",
    "however , this does nt remove the possibility that the 1.4ghz and 15@xmath0 m flux has been lensed and the geometry of the lens system is such that the observed offsets between the source and lens are within the astrometric errors .",
    "however , if this were the case we would expect the 1.4ghz - to-850@xmath0 m flux ratio to yield a redshift estimate consistent with a distant background source .",
    "in fact , all but sources 14.11 and 14.18 , have 1.4ghz - to-850@xmath0 m flux ratios consistent with a low - redshift ( @xmath58 1 ) system .",
    "source 14.18 is estimated to lie at @xmath9 1.4@xmath51 0.3 , which is not so large a discrepancy from the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath50=0.66 that it could be considered clear evidence for lensing ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that although the submillimeter source has been amplified , the radio and iso emission belong to the foreground galaxy . in this case",
    "the scuba source could lie at very high - redshift but the 1.4ghz - to-850@xmath0 m flux would produce an erroneously low - redshift . as outlined above ( and in  3.2 ) this is possible but statistically unlikely . thus we conclude that sources 3.8 , 3,10 , 3,15 , 3.25 and 14.18 have been correctly identified with low - redshift systems .",
    "source 14.11 , on the other hand , is very suggestive of lensing .",
    "though the optical identification does not have a measured redshift its color , angular size , morphology , and apparent magnitude are all consistent with a low - redshift elliptical . not only is it difficult to reconcile strong submillimeter emission with this object , its lack of a radio detection places it at @xmath56 1.1 .",
    "it is likely , then , that this is not the correct identification .",
    "whether or not it is actually a lensed system can not be addressed by these data .",
    "the first part of this work was concerned with identifying the multi - wavelength counterparts of the sources in the 14field . in the remaining sections we will discuss the general properties of the population and expand the discussion to include both the 14and 3catalogues .",
    "there are a number of securely identified sources in both fields which have reliable redshift estimates and relatively well studied seds .",
    "we will uses these objects as templates to draw tentative conclusions about the nature of the counterparts of all the objects",
    ". we will argue that we have correctly identified @xmath2 50% of the catalogue , and that the remaining unidentified sources are likely faint , red objects beyond the detection limits of this work .",
    "the radio and mid - ir identifications for the 3field sources were presented in paper iv , and the optical / nir counterparts are discussed in clements et al . ,",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "clements et al .",
    "employ a slightly different algorithm for identifying counterparts than this work and use @xmath31-band images using ufti camera on the ukirt telescope as the primary nir data set . in order to directly compare the identifications of the 3field sources with those of the 14field",
    "we have repeated the above 14field identification analysis on the 3sources using the cfhtir data .",
    "this analysis produces a list of candidate identifications in good agreement with those of clements et al .",
    "there are 11 3field sources whose nir identifications have @xmath41 0.1 .",
    "statistically , we expect about three of these to be due to chance coincidence and the remaining eight identifications to be correct .",
    "working from the radio data , there are 9 sources in the 3catalogue which have been detected at 1.4 ghz ( 11 mjy , 1@xmath24 ) , six of which are the same identifications as those selected by the nir algorithm with @xmath41 0.1 . of the remaining three radio identifications two",
    "are still the best identification selected by the algorithm , but at a lower level of significance . the remaining source ( 3.17 )",
    "is the only radio - detected source in our catalogue which does not have an optical / nir counterpart to the depths of these data .",
    "thus , based on comparison to the radio identifications , our nir algorithm remains successful at selecting the correct counterparts in the 3field .",
    "however , there may be a higher level of contamination ( 5/11 ) for the 3field than for the 14field ( 2/7 ) , ( if these are indeed incorrect identifications ) , two sources are not identified with confidence , and one is missed due to its faintness .      in figure [ tracks ] we show the @xmath29 , @xmath31 and 1.4 ghz fluxes of five radio - detected objects as they would appear when placed at higher redshifts .",
    "these are sources 14.1 , 14.13 , 14.18 , 3.10 , and 3.15 which have measurements in at least four optical / nir filters .",
    "sources 14.13 , 14.18 , and 3.10 have spectroscopically measured redshifts , while for 14.1 and 3.15 we have assumed the radio - far - infrared redshift estimate .",
    "for the 3field sources , which have only 1.4 ghz measurements , a spectral index typical of star forming galaxies was adopted : @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "a number of interesting conclusions may be drawn from this figure .",
    "firstly , the optically faint natures of these objects do not require them to lie at very high - redshift .",
    "all of these objects reach @xmath30 = 26 between @xmath60 1.3 ( 3.10 ) and @xmath60 3.5 ( 14.1 ) .",
    "they are all visible at @xmath31 to higher redshifts than at @xmath29 , but would drop out of our @xmath31 image between @xmath61 1.7 ( 3.10 ) and @xmath60 4.5 ( 14.1 and 14.13 ) .    secondly , all of these objects become undetectable at 1.4 ghz ( to our 1.4 ghz limits ) at significantly lower redshift than they do at @xmath31 . for example , source 14.1 would drop out of the radio survey at @xmath60 3.3 , while remaining visible at @xmath31 to @xmath9 4.5 .",
    "source 3.10 becomes undetectable at 1.4 ghz at @xmath60 0.5 , while still visible at @xmath31 to @xmath9 1.7 .",
    "this has important consequences for the identifications .",
    "if these radio sources are appropriate templates for the entire population there should be no submillimeter sources in the sample which are detected in the radio but have no @xmath31-band counterpart to our limits .",
    "indeed there are none in the 14field and only one in the 3field",
    ". moreover , there will be counterparts with similar optical / nir properties to the radio - detected objects , but which have no radio detection .",
    "we may use this fact to identify likely counterparts in the absence of radio information .",
    "figure [ colmag ] presents a nir color - magnitude diagram for the best identification for each source in the 14and 3catalogues .",
    "the solid circles correspond to the identifications with radio detections , and the solid diamonds to those with @xmath41 0.1 but with no radio detection .",
    "the open symbols correspond to the best identification for each of the remaining scuba sources . for comparison the magnitudes and colors of all the galaxies in the cfhtir 14image",
    "are also shown ( plus signs ) . the bulk of identifications with radio detections or with @xmath41 0.1 lie along the upper envelope of the general population , and are among the reddest objects at each magnitude    overlaid on figure [ colmag ] are two sets of tracks .",
    "the dashed lines show the extrapolated magnitudes and colors , as a function of redshift , for the five radio sources from figure [ tracks ] .",
    "also shown ( solid lines ) are the predicted nir colors and magnitudes for three ulirgs studied by @xcite as they would appear at higher redshifts .",
    "though all three are ulirgs they do not have consistent optical / nir colors , particularly at high - redshift .",
    "in particular , iras f12112 + 0305 ( the bluest track ) remains relatively blue at all redshifts .",
    "thus it is not a foregone conclusion that these objects must have very red optical / nir colors because simply because they are dusty .",
    "indeed , sources 3.6 , 3.25 , and 3.27 are much bluer than the other radio sources ( albeit with large uncertainties on their color ) and lie along the track of iras f12112 + 0305 .",
    "many of the non - radio identifications lie along the extrapolated tracks of the radio counterparts figure [ colmag ] , indicating that they may be similar to the securely identified sources , but lie at higher redshifts .",
    "we can use this information to identify likely counterparts and estimate redshifts for roughly 50% of the sample .",
    "we begin by discussing those objects with @xmath41 0.1 which do not have a radio detection . in the 14field these are sources 14.11 and 14.23 .",
    "source 14.23 lies within the same region as sources 14.1 , 14.3 , and 14.9 .",
    "in fact , it has the exact color and magnitude as source 14.13 if placed at @xmath50 = 3.1 .",
    "source 14.11 , on the other hand , lies in the lower left corner of the plot with the bright , blue galaxies , far away from the radio sources .",
    "based on this it is reasonable to conclude that source 14.11 is incorrectly identified while 14.23 is likely correct ( see  4.3 for further arguments that 14.11 has not been correctly identified ) .",
    "the fact that source 14.23 has not been detected at 1.4 ghz is not worrying as source 14.13 would not be detected in the radio beyond @xmath60 1.2 , though it would be visible at @xmath29 and @xmath31 to @xmath9 3.5 and @xmath9 4 respectively .    in the 3field sources 3.2 , 3.4 , 3.5 , 3.13",
    ", 3.16 have @xmath41 0.1 but do not have radio detections .",
    "three of these ( sources 3.4 , 3.13 , and 3.22 ) have colors consistent with radio sources at higher redshift , and we therefore take these to be the correct counterparts",
    ".    there are four sources ( 14.2 , 14.5 , 14.14 , and 14.22 ) with @xmath5 0.1 and colors consistent with the radio identifications at higher redshifts .",
    "this is approximately the number of identifications expected over random associations at this level of significance .    to summarize , given the radio and iso identifications and those nir selected identifications deemed correct based on their location in the color - magnitude diagram",
    "we have identified likely counterparts for 50% of the sources in our submillimeter catalogue .",
    "later in the paper we will argue that the remaining 50% are likely faint and red and lie below the detection limits of these data .",
    "simple redshift estimates may be made for objects based on optical / nir and colours using the secure , well - studied , low - redshift identifications as templates . for each identification",
    "we find the template sed ( figure [ tracks ] ) and redshift that best describes the source s nir magnitude and colour .",
    "the resulting redshift estimates are listed in table [ redshifts ] along with the millimeteric and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the mid - ir and submillimeter colours may also be used to roughly constrain redshifts .",
    "four sources in our catalogue have 450  detections and eight sources are identified with 15  iso detections . in papers",
    "iv and vi we argued that provided these objects have similar seds to typical local ulirgs and dusty starburst galaxies these 11 sources ( one is detected at both 450and 15 ) must lie at @xmath623 .",
    "indeed , two of these are spectroscopically confirmed to lie at @xmath50=0.660 ( 14.18 ) and @xmath50=1.15 ( 14.13 ) .",
    "we do not have enough information to estimate a redshift distribution .",
    "however , assuming each source lies at its redshift lower - limit places a lower - limit on the median redshift of the population of @xmath63 1.4 .",
    "at least 4% of the sources must lie at @xmath62 1.0 based on sources 3.10 and 14.18 which are secure identifications with spectroscopic redshifts . if source 3.8 is correctly identified , and sources 3.15 and 3.25 have a correctly estimated redshift , the fraction of sources below @xmath9 1.0 rises to 10% .",
    "the remaining 45 sources are constrained to @xmath64 1.0 based on their non - detection at 1.4 ghz .",
    "as our redshift estimates are limited to low - redshift it is difficult to assess the number of sources in our catalogue which lie at redshifts @xmath65 2 - 3 .",
    "though we have possible identifications with a small number of lbgs , these are not secure , and only one is spectroscopically confirmed to lie at @xmath9 3 . however , based on the radio , iso and 450  data we claim that no more than @xmath2 60% may lie at @xmath66 3.0",
    ". these results are in agreement with the general consensus in the literature that the bulk of the sources lie at @xmath66 1 with a median redshift @xmath60 2 - 3 @xcite .      in order to get a feel for the types of redshift distributions that are consistent with the identifications of this paper",
    ", we have developed simple models of the data . using the radio galaxies ( 14.1 , 14.13 , 14.18 , 3.10 ) as templates , we randomly populate gaussian redshift distributions of varying peak redshifts and widths , and recover the @xmath29 and @xmath31 magnitudes of the counterparts .",
    "as an aside , two caveats regarding sources 14.18 and sources 3.10 should be remembered in this analysis .",
    "firstly , in  4.3 we discssed the possibility that sources 14.18 and 3.10 were incorrectly identified with foreground , low - redshift lenses , and though we concluded that this was unlikely it may in fact be the case . secondly ,",
    "even if these low - redshift objects are correctly identified , they may be unrepresentative of the higher - redshift population @xcite .",
    "however , as there currently no strong evidence to suggest otherwise we proceed with the simple assumption that these objects are not unique .",
    "figure [ model1 ] shows sample nir colour - magnitude diagrams for a variety of models . for these plots , artificial catalogues of 50 scuba sources",
    "have been produced ( the same number as our catalogue ) .    from these plots",
    "a few basic conclusions may be drawn .",
    "it is immediately obvious that all three redshift distributions centered on @xmath50 = 1 have a surplus of identifications at bright @xmath31-magnitudes , compared to the real data .",
    "the implication that the median redshift must lie at @xmath67 1 has been well established in the previous section as well as in the work of many previous papers , including our own ( see previous section and references therein ) .",
    "while a low - redshift distribution would produce too many bright identificaitons , a narrow redshift distribution centered at @xmath50 = 3 has the opposite problem as all the counterparts would lie beyond our @xmath31-band limit , and yet we claim that for @xmath250% of our sources we have detected @xmath31-band counterparts .",
    "thus , a broad redshift distribution ( in this case @xmath68 = 1.0 - 1.5 ) centered at @xmath9 2 - 3 is most consistent with these identifications .    @xcite have put forth a phenomenological classification scheme for the scuba sources based on their optical / nir magnitudes .",
    "class-0 objects are very faint in both @xmath29 , ( @xmath69 26 ) , and @xmath31 , ( @xmath70 21 ) and so their optical / nir counterparts are below the detection limit of typical observations .",
    "class - i objects have @xmath71 21 and @xmath69 26 and are therefore classified as eros , detected only at @xmath31 .",
    "class - ii objects are relatively bright in both bands with @xmath72 26 and @xmath71 21 .",
    "a fourth class is also possible in which an object is detected at @xmath29 but not at @xmath31 . though scuba sources are expected to be red this scenario would be possible if some had seds similar to iras f12112 + 0305 , the relatively blue sed from @xcite ( see figure [ colmag ] ) .",
    "this broad classification scheme roughly divides the population into different phenomenological catalgories .",
    "class - ii systems likely lie within the low - redshift end of the population and may have been forming stars long enough to have built up significant stellar populations .",
    "class - i sources are all classified as eros .",
    "class - o sources likely represent the most extreme systems , either at very high - redshift or with immense amounts of dust extinction . laid out in this way , this classification scheme may represent an age sequence @xcite .",
    "though it would be preferable to apply this classification scheme directly to our identifications , the different @xmath29 and @xmath31 follow - up depths in these data and those of @xcite make this impossible .",
    "therfore we introduce a second classification system based on the specific flux limits of this work in order to directly compare the results of the models with the catalogue .",
    "we denote three classes which are analogous to ivison s classes and use the following nomenclature : + classw - o : @xmath73 25 ( @xmath74 25.45 ) ; @xmath75 23 ( @xmath76 21.2 ) classw - i : @xmath73 25 ( @xmath74 25.45 ) ; @xmath77 23 ( @xmath78 21.2 ) classw - ii : @xmath79 25 ( @xmath80 25.45 ) ; @xmath77 23 ( @xmath78 21.2 )   + in the remaining discussion we refer to ivison s classes as classi and our own as classw .",
    "we have generated 5000 artificial scuba sources and these have been grouped , for each model realization , into their respective class .",
    "these results are presented in tables 6.3 and 6.4 .",
    "the number of objects in classw-0 obviously increases with increasing @xmath81 , since as the objects are shifted to a higher median redshift a larger fraction drop below the detection limit .",
    "the number of class - ii objects correspondingly decreases . at @xmath81",
    "= 1 , 70 - 90% of the nir counterparts are classified as classw - ii and would be detected in our data ( and typical optical or nir surveys ) , at @xmath81 = 2 approximately 50%-60% ( depending on the width of the distribution ) , and at @xmath81 = 3 , 10% - 30% .",
    "in most cases the number of objects classified at classw - i is small .",
    "this is a consequence of both the observational limits at @xmath29 and @xmath31 and the location of the redshift tracks of the four template galaxies .",
    "once a galaxy becomes undetectable at @xmath29 the redshift window over which it is visible in @xmath31 is comparatively short .",
    "the exception to this is the highest redshift set of simulations , @xmath81 = 3 , in particular the narrow redshift distribution . in this scenario",
    "most galaxies are located in the neighborhood of @xmath9 3 where these template galaxies are expected to be visible at @xmath31 but not at @xmath29 ( see figure [ tracks ] ) .",
    "thus , the template galaxies tend to `` bunch up '' within classw - i .",
    "we may set some strict limits on the fraction of real cudss scuba sources in each group .",
    "there are 11 radio - detected sources with counterparts detected in both @xmath29 and @xmath31 and therefore at least 22% of the sample are classw - ii objects . including the likely identifications discussed in  5.3 increases this fraction to 32% .",
    "there is one radio source that is detected with @xmath82 23 but not in @xmath29 , plus three likely identifications .",
    "this sets a lower limit on the fraction of sources that are classw - i at 2 - 8% .",
    "there are five empty fields in the 3field , and two radio sources with @xmath83 25 and @xmath84 23 .",
    "this sets a lower - limit on the fraction of classw - o sources at 14% .",
    "we can also set an upper - limit on the number of objects in this group from the radio detections at @xmath44 76% and from all the likely identifications , @xmath44 60% . comparing these limits with table 7",
    "we see that a high median redshift of @xmath92 - 3 , with a broad redshift distribution produces the best reproduction of the data .",
    "these fractions are all broadly consistent with the classification of sources in two other systematically selected samples , the `` 8 mjy survey '' @xcite and the deeper lensing survey of @xcite .",
    "if the separation of objects in classii - class0 is the result of an evolutionary sequence , and surveys of different flux - limits are selecting different redshift regimes @xcite one might expect to see differences between the fraction of objects in each class for different surveys .",
    "though there is no significant difference in the number of classii objects we have in our catalogue , compared to other groups , we do have an unusually large number of very bright , low - redshift , counterparts .",
    "this would be expected if we are biased towards a population at lower redshift than shallower surveys .",
    "indeed , none of our low - redshift objects would have been detected in a survey with an 8 mjy flux - limit . moreover , though observations which reach deeper flux - limits than the cudss would also be expected to be sensitive to these lower - redshift sytems , they survey much smaller sky areas @xcite and the bulk are lensing surveys @xcite , designed to pick up lensed scuba sources behind galaxy clusters .",
    "thus , perhaps they simply have not have covered enough of the low - redshift universe to detect these objects , which make up a small fraction of the overall scuba population .      of key interest",
    "is the overlap between the scuba sources and the ero population . given only our secure radio identifications , at least 10% of the cudss sources are associated with bright eros ( that is , classw - ii eros ) . including the likely identifications raises this fraction to 22% .",
    "this sets a strict upper - limit to the number of bright eros since there are no eros within 8of a scuba source that were not chosen as the best ( and likely ) identification .",
    "this agrees very well with the estimate of @xcite that approximately one third of the `` 8 mjy survey '' sources are classified as eros .",
    "however , in table 7 we see the fraction of classw - ii eros is not very sensitive to the redshift distribution . of more interest , but harder to estimate , is the total number of scuba sources associated with eros , over all magnitudes . between @xmath85 2 and @xmath85 3 there is a substantial difference in the expected number of total ero counterparts , ranging from 60% to 90% .",
    "unfortunately , bulk of these lie at faint @xmath31 magnitues where the ero population has been sparseley studied .",
    "we may place an upper - limit on the true fraction based on the 8 radio sources which are not eros ( @xmath41 84% ) and the lower - limit of 22% from the number of bright ero identifications .",
    "the surface density of eros is not well constrained , due to small area coverage and the strong clustering of the population . however , if we take @xmath2 2 - 3 arcmin@xmath3 as a reasonable surface density for @xmath84 23 eros @xcite , and note that scuba galaxies with @xmath86 3 mjy have a surface density of @xmath2 0.5 arcmin@xmath3 then as many as 10% of eros to this @xmath31-limit may be submillimeter bright .    during the discussion in the previous sections we concluded that the remaining @xmath2 50% of the cudss sources which are unidentified do not have identifications present in our @xmath31-image but all lie in classw-0 , with @xmath75 23 and @xmath73 26 . in figure [ group0 ]",
    "we show the distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath31 magnitudes for @xmath87=3 and @xmath68 = 1.0 , 1.5 .",
    "it is immediately obvious that @xmath31 observations remain the method of choice over @xmath29 for detecting these counterparts .",
    "roughly 80% of the counterparts have @xmath82 26 ( @xmath8824.2 ) while at @xmath29 the objects are very evenly distributed over a wide range in magnitude .",
    "@xcite have reported a median magnitude of @xmath89 26 for the counterparts in their lensed sample , clearly implying the bright submillimeter sources are distinct from optically selected populations .",
    "the optical counterparts in our survey are also faint , though they have a slightly brighter median magnitude than found by @xcite .",
    "roughly 40% of our sample have secure or likely identifications with @xmath90 25 ( @xmath91 24.5 ) .",
    "therefore our median @xmath29-magnitude will surely be @xmath79 26 .",
    "the `` 8 mjy survey '' has also reported an abundance of relatively bright optical and nir counterparts . with deep 1.4 ghz imaging @xcite",
    "they have secured positions for 18/30 sources in their catalogue .",
    "roughly 90% of these have optical counterparts with @xmath92 25 ( @xmath9325.5 ) , which implies @xmath250% of their entire sample is brighter than this limit .    the smail et al . lensing project and the `` 8 mjy survey '' target slightly different 850  flux regimes and therefore one might expect a variation in optical / nir magnitudes between the two samples",
    ". however , different behaviours of the @xmath31-corrections at 850  and in the optical / nir , means the relationship between optical or nir magnitude and submillimeter flux is a combination of both the intrinsic properties of the galaxies and the redshift distribution.if intrinsic ( and hence observed ) submillimeter flux increases with redshift @xcite , the optical / nir properties were uniform across the submillimeter population , this would lead predominantly fainter counterparts in these bands for the brightest scuba sources .",
    "@xcite found that though the submillimeter sources possess a wide range of optical / nir properties , faint scuba sources ( @xmath94 4 mjy ) are typically identified with very faint nir counterparts ( albeit dealing with small numbers of sources ) . in figure [ k850 ]",
    "we plot the @xmath31-magnitude of the identifications in this work against the 850  flux densities , as well as the results of smail et al . and @xcite .",
    "the 13 radio sources with @xmath31-band detections are represented by the solid circles , the smail et al sources are denoted by the open circles and the ivsion et al . by the open triangle .",
    "it is immediately seen that some fainter scuba sources in this sample have very bright nir counterparts .",
    "also plotted ( crosses ) are the likely identifications from  5.3 which also show a broad range of @xmath31-magnitudes ( a factor of 25 in flux ) for a very small range of submillimeter flux ( a factor of 3 in flux ) .",
    "thus , we see no evidence in these data for a trend in @xmath31-magnitude with submillimeter flux , and in particular our faint submillimeter sources are not restricted to faint @xmath31-band counterparts .",
    "however , since this does not appear to be the case for the other two surveys this again highlights the possibility that different surveys are sensitive to different objects or redshift regimes .",
    "\\(i ) using multi - wavelength data , but focusing on the nir , we have selected identifications for submillimeter sources in the cudss 14field . we argue that our nir algorithm is just as effective at correctly identifying the counter - parts as radio follow - up , with minimal contamination from incorrect identifications .",
    "\\(ii ) using the securely identified radio sources as templates we select other likely identifications , based on common properties .",
    "we discuss these identifications in detail and find that many are very red and show unusual morphologies .",
    "\\(iii ) we claim that we have identified @xmath250% of the submm sources in the cudss sample .",
    "almost all of these identifications have @xmath95 25 , and therefore many are within reach of deep spectroscopic observations on 8-m class telescopes .",
    "\\(iv ) we present the spectroscopic and estimated redshifts for the identifications .",
    "we use the 1.4 ghz - to-850  flux ratio , and the @xcite template sed fitting technique as our main methods .",
    "we also use the radio sources as templates to estimate nir photometric redshifts for the non - radio detected identifications .",
    "\\(vi ) using simple models of the redshift distribution we argue that these data are consistent with a high median redshift ( @xmath9 3.0 ) and a broad distribution ( @xmath98 = 1.0 - 1.5 for a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "\\(vii ) to a nir limit of @xmath99 23.0 , @xmath2 10 - 22% of our identifications are classified as eros .",
    "however , we argue that eros truly make up @xmath260 - 84% of the sample , with the bulk of these found below our @xmath31-band limit .",
    "most of the remaining identifications , though not technically classified as eros will still be very red .",
    "hence deep @xmath31-band imaging will continue to be an important tool in the follow - up of these sources .",
