    "a study of disorder in condensed matter systems is useful from two perspectives .",
    "disorder is inherent in most condensed matter systems and often has profound effects on their properties .",
    "incorporation of small amounts of paramagnetic impurities in a metallic host can result in the kondo effect which gives the well - known logarithmic temperature dependence of the resistivity upon cooling , and eventually crosses over to a fermi - liquid regime with a characteristic low energy scale , the kondo temperature .",
    "conversely , impurities at low concentrations can act as a probe providing specific signatures of the environment they exist in . from the latter perspective , the kondo effect is a set of signatures of certain low - energy excitations of the host lacking long - range magnetic order .",
    "for instance , exotic kondo effects are known to arise in itinerant electron magnets near criticality  @xcite and in insulating quantum spin - liquid systems  @xcite owing to the paramagnons and spinonic excitations respectively .",
    "a study of impurity effects in the spin-@xmath0 honeycomb kitaev model  @xcite is very appealing in this context .",
    "this kitaev model is integrable and the ground state can be either a gapless or gapped quantum ( @xmath3 ) spin - liquid with extremely short - ranged spin correlations .",
    "@xcite the elementary excitations are not spin-@xmath1 bosons that one typically expects for magnetic systems in two dimensions and higher , but emergent dispersing majorana fermions ( spinons ) and @xmath3 vortices ( @xmath4flux excitations associated with spins at the vertices of the hexagonal plaquettes ) which in the gapless phase are known to be non - abelian anyons .",
    "@xcite experimental realization looks increasingly imminent with several interesting proposals to realize kitaev physics in two - dimensional quantum - compass materials such as the alkali iridates  @xcite and ruthenium trichloride ,  @xcite and independently in cold - atom optical lattices .",
    "@xcite    introducing a paramagnetic impurity into the model through local exchange - coupling of the impurity spin with a host ( kitaev ) spin results in a highly unusual kondo effect  @xcite owing to the peculiar elementary excitations in the host . for an @xmath5 kitaev model with an energy scale @xmath6",
    "coupled locally to a spin-@xmath7 impurity , the perturbative scaling equations for the impurity coupling @xmath8 turn out to be independent of its sign , with an intermediate coupling unstable fixed point @xmath9 separating weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "such scaling differs qualitatively from the kondo effect in metals ( and graphene ,  @xcite ) where a nontrivial effect is seen only for antiferromagnetic coupling , but is similar to the kondo scaling reported for paramagnetic impurities in certain pseudogapped bosonic spin - liquids .",
    "@xcite the distinguishing feature of the kitaev - kondo problem is that the weak and strong coupling limits correspond to different topologies of the ground state .",
    "@xcite    despite the insensitivity of the scaling equations to the sign of impurity coupling , the strong coupling limits for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are very different physically . in the antiferromagnetic case ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the strong - coupling limit for an @xmath5 impurity spin corresponds to a spin singlet at the impurity site - equivalent to the kitaev model with a missing site , which is an integrable model . in the ferromagnetic case",
    ", the strong - coupling limit corresponds to a non - integrable problem where one of the sites has @xmath12 while the rest have @xmath13 the problem of missing sites ( spinless vacancies ) in the kitaev model has received much attention in recent times .",
    "it was independently reported in ref . and ref .",
    "that the ground state of the kitaev model with a missing site is associated with a finite @xmath3 flux through the defect .",
    "that would not be the case , for example in graphene , where although the dirac fermions have the same dispersion as the emergent majorana fermions in the kitaev model , the phases of the intersite hopping matrix elements in graphene are identical for every bond and do not change upon the creation of defects .",
    "in contrast , the phases of the intersite hopping elements of the majorana fermions in the kitaev model are a degree of freedom and can take values @xmath14 or @xmath15 for the missing site problem , the magnetic susceptibility is predicted@xcite to have logarithmic singularities both as a function of the magnetic field as well as the temperature .",
    "some of the singularities in magnetic susceptibility reported in refs .",
    "are reminiscent of the two - channel kondo problem , and we shall later discuss a connection between such singularities and the presence of bound , zero energy majorana fermions in the kitaev model with a vacancy  @xcite as well as in the two - channel kondo model .",
    "@xcite vacancy induced spin textures have also been studied by exact diagonalization@xcite of finite clusters of up to 24 spins described by more general ( and nonintegrable ) kitaev - heisenberg models in the presence of a small magnetic field . in ref . , it was reported that a vacancy induces longer ranged spin - spin correlations that extend beyond the single bond correlations one has in the defect - free kitaev model .",
    "@xcite the low - energy properties of the kitaev model with a random and dilute concentration of vacancies are also quite interesting .",
    "such rare but locally singular perturbations are predicted to result in qualitatively different low - energy properties compared to that expected for gaussian white noise type disorder.@xcite    in contrast to the understanding we currently have on the effects of single and multiple vacancies in the kitaev model , much less is known about the effect of spinful defects where the defect site has a different spin from the host sites .",
    "part of the reason is that while the vacancy problem is integrable and affords a simplification of a difficult problem where interactions and disorder are both present , the problem with an @xmath16 defect can not be reduced to a noninteracting one .",
    "some progress was made in ref .",
    "where it was explicitly demostrated that the ground states of both the vacancy as well as @xmath16 defect problems have a two - fold degeneracy .",
    "however , it could not be established whether the @xmath16 defect was also associated with a finite @xmath3 flux that is the case when a vacancy is present .",
    "it was also not demonstrated whether the strong coupling fixed points were indeed stable .",
    "the stability is an important issue , for otherwise one would expect new intermediate coupling stable fixed points and not only would our understanding of the kondo effect in the kitaev model be incomplete , but also the paramagnetic impurity route for generating vacancies and spinful defects would no longer be appropriate .",
    "the latter issue is of interest from a practical point of view too since it would make it possible to generate nonabelian anyons conveniently using a spin - polarized stm tip to bind a kitaev spin ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically .",
    "it is also not clear whether the topological transition and the magnetic transitions are coincident or occur at the same value of the impurity coupling strength .    in this paper",
    "we address these open questions and make the following new findings .",
    "we demonstrate the stability of the strong coupling limit demonstrated for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases which implies stability of the spin-@xmath14 vacancies and spin-@xmath1 defects created through this route .",
    "we perform exact diagonalization calculations for a finite fragment of the kitaev model coupled to a paramagnetic impurity and show that while for weak impurity coupling , the ground state corresponds to zero @xmath3 flux at the impurity site , for strong coupling , the ground state has a finite flux irrespective of the sign of impurity coupling .",
    "for the value of impurity coupling that corresponds to this topological transition , we also observe the total spin at the impurity site going to zero or one depending on the sign of coupling - this establishes that the the topological as well as the weak coupling to strong coupling transitions occur very close to each other and possibly at the same point . as a corollary",
    ", we find that the ground state with a spin-@xmath1 defect corresponds to a finite flux at the defect site .",
    "finally , we report an intriguing connection between the susceptibilities of a vacancy in the kitaev model and of the magnetic impurity in a two - channel kondo model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.[sec : model ] provides a brief introduction to the honeycomb spin-@xmath0 kitaev model . in sec.[sec : kondo ] we study the effect of coupling an external paramagnetic impurity to the kitaev host through a local exchange coupling .",
    "a poor man s scaling analysis of the impurity coupling reveals an unstable fixed point separating the weak and strong - coupling regimes .",
    "the stability if the strong coupling fixed point is demonstrated for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity couplings .",
    "it is also shown that the strong and weak coupling limits correspond to different topology of the ground state .",
    "new conserved quantities are identified which are composite operators of an impurity spin component and two kitaev flux operators .",
    "sec.[sec : numerical ] contains the result of exact diagonalization calculations of finite kitaev fragments coupled to external spins .",
    "the key findings in this section are ( a)establishing that a finite @xmath2 flux is associated with the ground state of the spin@xmath17 kitaev model with a spin@xmath18 defect - just as in the case of a vacancy , and ( b ) the magnetic ( kondo ) and topological transitions occur very close to each other and are possibly coincident . in sec.[sec : two - channel ] we discuss the intriguing parallels between the low - temperature magnetic response of the kitaev model with a missing site and the two - channel kondo model .",

    "[ fig : kondo - on - site ] ) . the contribution from on - site scattering ( fig.[fig :",

    "if either the impurity is a @xmath77 spin , or the kondo interaction is rotationally symmetric , the above contribution renormalizes the kondo coupling constant .",

    "we thus have @xmath79 just as for the kondo effect in graphene@xcite , owing to the change in the density of states with bandwidth ( here @xmath80 ) , we also need to consider the change in @xmath8 due to the rescaling done in order to keep the total number of states fixed .",

    "we consider the hamiltonian such that the kondo term and the kitaev model with one spin missing ( @xmath96 ) constitute the unperturbed hamiltonian and kitaev coupling to the site at origin is the perturbation : @xmath97 for antiferromagnetic kondo coupling ( @xmath10 ) , the ground state consists of a kondo singlet of @xmath98 and the kitaev model with one spin missing .",
    "the perturbation term causes transitions from singlet to triplet states of the kondo singlet .",
    "we use effective hamiltonian scheme@xcite to include the effects of the perturbation terms within the projected ground state subspace .",
    "@xmath99 where @xmath100 is chosen such that the terms which take us out of the reduced hilbert space are canceled order by order .",
    "this gives the reduced hamiltonian as @xmath101 where @xmath102 belong to the ground state manifold and @xmath103 belongs to excited state manifold .",

    "as @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 here , @xmath112 denotes the eigenstates of the kitaev model with the spin at origin missing . since change in energy of the kitaev state is @xmath113 , we ignore their contribution in the energy denominators of the perturbation term .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath114 are then @xmath115 here , in @xmath116 the subscript @xmath117 refers to a neighoring site of the origin in the direction of the @xmath35bond .",
    "thus , in the antiferromagnetic coupling case , the kondo singlet decouples from the rest of the kitaev model and a small interaction ( @xmath118 ) is generated between the kitaev spin at the origin and the sins at the three neighboring sites in the second order perturbation .",
    "the strong coupling fixed point is thus a stable fixed point and is equivalent to the kitaev model with one site missing .      in the ferromagnetic kondo coupling case ,",
    "the triplet states form the ground state manifold .",
    "we perform degenerate perturbation theory to get the effective hamiltonian : @xmath119 if we calculate the matrix elements of @xmath120 these matrices are just the spin@xmath18 matrices : @xmath121 and the hamiltonian in the reduced subspace becomes @xmath122 where @xmath123 represents the spin-1 at the origin .",
    "thus for ferromagnetic impurity coupling , the new terms which couple the triplet and the rest of the kitaev model are similar to the original kitaev coupling and of the same strength .",
    "we get a kitaev - like model with a spin@xmath18 at the origin and spin@xmath124 elsewhere . here",
    "the kondo triplet does not decouple from rest of the kitaev model in the strong coupling limit and does not lend itself to a simple treatment , unlike the corresponding antiferromagnetic case .",
    "a remarkable property of the kondo effect in kitaev model is that the unstable fixed point is associated with a topological transition from the zero flux state to a finite flux state .",
    "the strong antiferromagnetic coupling limit amounts to studying the kitaev model with a missing site or cutting the three bonds linking this site to the neighbors .",
    "it was shown in kitaev s original paper@xcite that such states with an odd number of cuts are associated with a finite flux , and also that these vortices are associated with unpaired majorana fermions and have non - abelian statistics under exchange .",
    "it has also been shown numerically for the gapless phase@xcite that the ground state of the kitaev model with one spin missing has a finite flux pinned to the defect site .",
    "we argue the existence of a localized zero energy majorana mode from the degeneracy of the ground state in presence of impurity spin and elucidate on the nature of this zero mode .    for the hamiltonian @xmath125 the three plaquettes @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unpaired ] ) that touch the impurity site are no longer associated with conserved flux operators , while the flux operators that do not include the origin remain conserved .",
    "the three plaquette operator @xmath129 is still conserved and @xmath130 in the ground state of the unperturbed kitaev model .    we now define composite operators @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 are the pauli spin matrices corresponding to the impurity ) .",
    "remarkably , these composite operators represent conserved quantities for arbitrary values of the impurity coupling .",

    "schematic of the three unpaired b ",
    "majorana fermions formed as a result of cutting the links to the kitaev spin at the origin .",
    "any two of the three can be given an expectation value ( dotted bond ) . ]    in the strong antiferromagnetic coupling limit @xmath140 the low energy states will be the ones in which the spin at the origin forms a singlet @xmath141 with the impurity spin , @xmath142 here @xmath143 represents the low energy states of the kitaev model with the spin at the origin removed . to see the action of the @xmath136 symmetry generators on these states , we note that they can be written as @xmath144 and @xmath145 do not involve the components of the spin at the origin , @xmath146 we then have @xmath147 .",
    "so , in the strong coupling limit , the symmetry generators act non - trivially only in the kitaev model sector , implying that the low energy states of the kitaev model with one spin removed are all doubly degenerate , with the double degeneracy emerging from the kitaev sector .",
    "this is also true for the zero - energy mode in the single particle spectrum : the two degenerate states correspond to the zero mode being occupied or unoccupied .",
    "let us examine the structure of the zero mode .",

    "this is not a mere coincidence . in the two - channel kondo problem , it is long known  @xcite that the low energy physics is described by a model of a localized , zero energy majorana fermion interacting with a band of dispersing majorana fermions with a finite density of states at the fermi energy .",

    "<S> paramagnetic impurities in a quantum spin - liquid can result in kondo effects with highly unusual properties . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the effect of locally exchange - coupling a paramagnetic impurity with the spin-@xmath0 honeycomb kitaev model in its gapless spin - liquid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the ( impurity ) scaling equations are found to be insensitive to the sign of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the weak and strong coupling fixed points are stable , with the latter corresponding to a noninteracting vacancy and an interacting , spin-@xmath1 defect for the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state in the strong coupling limit in both cases has a nontrivial topology associated with a finite @xmath2 flux at the impurity site . for the antiferromagnetic case </S>",
    "<S> , this result can be obtained straightforwardly owing to the integrability of the kitaev model with a vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> the strong - coupling limit of the ferromagnetic case is however nonintegrable , and we address this problem through exact - diagonalization calculations with finite kitaev fragments . </S>",
    "<S> our exact diagonalization calculations indicate that that the weak to strong coupling transition and the topological phase transition occur rather close to each other and are possibly coincident . </S>",
    "<S> we also find an intriguing similarity between the magnetic response of the defect and the impurity susceptibility in the two - channel kondo problem . </S>"
