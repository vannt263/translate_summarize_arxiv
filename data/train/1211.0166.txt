    "during the last years , intensive theoretical and experimental efforts towards a deeper understanding of the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking phenomena have been made . in these proceedings",
    "we focus on the qcd phase transition at non - vanishing temperature and the related center symmetry breaking by investigating so - called dual observables @xcite .",
    "dual observables can be related to the spectrum of the dirac operator and therefore comprehend information on both , the chiral properties and the confinement of quarks .",
    "they have first been introduced in lattice calculations @xcite but are also accessible via functional methods @xcite . within a dyson - schwinger approach @xcite we study the center phase transition in qcd and in fundamentally charged scalar qcd .",
    "for the solution of the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) of the scalar / quark propagator quenched lattice input for the gluon propagator has been used @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of this investigation is a novel order parameter for the center phase transition @xcite which still exhibits a considerable dependence on the used model for the scalar / quark - gluon vertex .",
    "this requires a more detailed vertex analysis in future studies @xcite .",
    "the dse for the quark propagator at finite temperature reads has been used , while in landau gauge the ghost - gluon vertex renormalization constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ghost renormalization constant @xmath1 is omitted as it cancels by a corresponding factor in the quark - gluon vertex model .",
    "the remaining constant @xmath2 is eliminated within a mom scheme .",
    "@xmath3 is the fundamental casimir invariant , @xmath4 for @xmath5 . ]",
    "@xmath6 with the momenta @xmath7 .",
    "the generalized matsubara modes @xmath8 depend on the general boundary angle @xmath9.-dependent boundary conditions for the quark fields has been referred to as @xmath10 .",
    "this corresponds to qcd at imaginary chemical potential . ]",
    "the usual fermionic boundary conditions are obtained for @xmath11 . for the propagator we use the conventional ansatz @xmath12 and",
    "for the quark - gluon vertex the temperature dependent model @xcite @xmath13 } { 4\\pi}\\biggr)^{2\\delta}\\biggr\\}\\ ,   \\end{split } \\label{eq : quarkgluonvertex}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the in- and outgoing quark momenta and @xmath16 the gluon momentum .",
    "the first part of the vertex ( [ eq : quarkgluonvertex ] ) consists of a slavnov - taylor motivated ansatz , whereas the logarithmic tail together with the anomalous dimension @xmath17 ensures a running coupling - like behaviour of the vertex in the uv regime .",
    "the remaining model parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are purely phenomenological , where in the following we take the values proposed in @xcite .",
    "the system can now be solved by using the gluon propagator as input from quenched lattice results @xcite .    from the quark propagator , various order parameters can be extracted .",
    "the @xmath20-dependent quark condensate is given by @xmath21 where the case @xmath11 corresponds to the ordinary quark condensate . with a fourier transform of the previous condensate the dual quark condensate @xcite",
    "is obtained with respect to the winding number @xmath22 @xmath23 in the following we fix @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 transforms like the conventional polyakov loop @xcite under center transformation and is therefore a suitable order parameter for the center transition @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite . alternatively , the scalar quark dressing function @xmath26 , evaluated at vanishing external momenta , is also sensitive to center symmetry breaking @xcite . as proposed in @xcite .",
    "] however , if only the lowest matsubara mode is taken into account as suggested in @xcite no satisfactory results could be obtained .",
    "hence , we propose the following order parameter @xmath27 ^ 2   \\label{eq : orderparameter_quark}\\ ] ] for the center phase transition .",
    "the novel condensate @xmath28 is periodic in the boundary conditions and transforms like the conventional polyakov loop under center transformations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the quark condensate @xmath29 the new condensate is also finite away from the chiral limit .",
    "before we substantiate our proposals with numerical results we proceed with the investigation of the center phase transition in scalar qcd .",
    "replacing the quarks by fundamental charged scalar fields provides a simpler model system due to the absence of dirac structure . neglecting the four - particle interactions the dse for the scalar propagator reads . ] @xmath30 with @xmath31 . for the scalar - gluon vertex we employ the model @xmath32}{4\\pi}\\biggr)^{2\\delta}\\biggr\\}.",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] here , the conventions for the momenta as well as the uv vertex behaviour is equivalent to the one in eq .. in addition , we introduced a scalar propagator dependent function which is motivated from ward identities in scalar electrodynamics and represents a generalized ball - chiu vertex @xcite .",
    "the remaining part is again purely phenomenological where a dimensionless modeling constant @xmath33 is introduced which improves the description of the phase transition . with the same lattice gluon propagator as in",
    ", the system can be solved and the order parameters can be extracted .",
    "similar to the previous qcd case the following object serves as an order parameter for the center phase transition in scalar qcd @xmath34 i.e. , @xmath35 is periodic in @xmath20 and transforms like the conventional polyakov loop under center transformations @xcite .",
    "in order to confirm that @xmath36 , eq . , and @xmath37 , eq . , are well - defined order parameters we consider both qcd and scalar qcd at finite temperatures . in fig.[fig : orderparameter_quarka ] the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath28 and the quark condensate @xmath29 are shown .",
    "while both quantities are periodic in @xmath38 and symmetric in @xmath39 the scalar quark dressing function @xmath40 , evaluated at vanishing momenta and lowest matsubara mode , is not periodic . above the critical temperature @xmath41 mev all three quantities melt and , in the chiral limit , a plateau is formed .",
    "below @xmath42 the quark condensate is nearly constant while @xmath28 is slightly enhanced around @xmath11 .",
    "this yields a non - zero value of @xmath36 below @xmath42 as compared to the dual condensate @xmath25 which almost vanishes in this region as shown in fig.[fig : orderparameter_quarkb ] .",
    "note that the temperature behaviour of @xmath36 below the phase transition can be further tuned by varying the vertex model parameters .",
    "in contrast , the order parameter @xmath43 , as defined in @xcite , considerably deviates from zero already below the phase transition , whereas @xmath25 and @xmath36 stay close to zero . in order to see the expected behaviour of the order parameters",
    "the incorporation of all matsubara modes is mandatory .    for scalar qcd",
    "we obtain similar results as is demonstrated in fig.[fig : orderparameter_scalara ] where the @xmath20-dependence of the condensate @xmath35 is shown .",
    "below @xmath42 the condensate is @xmath20-independent and therefore @xmath37 vanishes while above @xmath42 it is suppressed around @xmath11 and hence @xmath37 is non - vanishing .",
    "this is displayed in fig.[fig : orderparameter_scalarb ] where a distinct phase transition is observed .",
    "however , the results strongly dependent on the used scalar - gluon vertex model .",
    "within the dyson - schwinger formalism we investigated the center phase transition of qcd and fundamentally charged scalar qcd .",
    "a novel order parameter was introduced which exhibits an improved behaviour below @xmath42 compared to the order parameter @xmath43 proposed in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the strong model dependence on the used vertex further studies of the corresponding scalar / quark - gluon vertex are on - going , see e.g. @xcite .",
