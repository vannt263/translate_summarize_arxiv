    "it was defined for the first time probably by henri cartan @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , definition 1 ) ) .",
    "although the notion of a limit along a filter was defined here in the maximal possible generality  the considered filter could be a filter on an arbitrary set and the limit was defined for any map from this set to a topological space  the attention of mathematicians in the following years was mostly focused to two special cases .    in general topology",
    "the notion of the limit of a filter on a topological space @xmath2 became one of the two basic tools used to describe the convergence in general topological spaces together with the notion of a net ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.6 ) ) .",
    "some authors studied also the convergence of a sequence along a filter .",
    "this notion was rediscovered independently by several authors , we could mention a.  robinson @xcite , a.  r.  bernstein @xcite ( these authors used ultrafilters only ) or m.  kattov @xcite .",
    "the definition of the limit along a filter can be reformulated using ideals  the dual notion to the notion of filter .",
    "this type of limit of sequences was introduced independently by p.  kostyrko , m.  maaj and t. alt @xcite and f.  nuray and w.  h.  ruckle @xcite and studied under the name _",
    "@xmath3-convergence _ of a sequence by several authors ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation for this direction of research was an effort to generalize some known results on statistical convergence .",
    "since the notions that we intend to generalize in this paper stem from one of the results on the statistical convergence , let us describe in more detail how they evolved .",
    "motivated by a result of t.  alt @xcite and j.  a.  fridy @xcite about statistically convergent sequences , the authors of @xcite also defined so called @xmath1-convergence ( a sequence @xmath4 being _",
    "@xmath1-convergent _ to @xmath5 provided that there exist @xmath6 such that the corresponding subsequence converges to @xmath5 ) and asked for which ideals the notions of @xmath3-convergence and @xmath1-convergence coincide .",
    "this question was answered in @xcite where the authors showed that these notions coincide if and only ifthe ideal @xmath3 satisfies the property ap , which we call @xmath7 here ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "later the analogues of the notion of @xmath1-convergence were defined and similar characterizations were obtained for double sequences ( see @xcite ) and nets ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper we define @xmath0-convergence as a common generalization of all these types of @xmath1-convergence and obtain results which strengthen the results from the above papers . in the last section we also point at neglected relation between the @xmath3-convergence of sequences and double sequences .",
    "although our motivation arises mainly from the results obtained for sequences , we will work with functions .",
    "one of the reasons is that using functions sometimes helps to simplify notation .",
