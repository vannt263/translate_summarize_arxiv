    "accelerating expansion of the universe has been shown from the type ia supernova ( snia ) observations @xcite since 1998 .",

    ", theorists introduce an exotic energy component with negative pressure , which is called as dark energy .",
    "this idea has greatly inspirited theorists to propose a lot of dark energy models .",
    "the simplest but most natural candidate of de is the cosmological constant @xmath0 , with the constant equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 .",
    "this model keeps a good fit with the cosmic observations , but it suffers from the fine - tuning problem and the cosmic coincidence problem . to avoid the issues , the unified dark fluid ( udf ) models have been put forward and further studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in principle",
    ", the eos can be determined to an integration constant by the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "based on this opinion , the so - called @xmath2cdm or constant adiabatic sound speed ( cass ) model was proposed @xcite , where a constant adiabatic sound speed @xmath3 was assumed .",
    "meanwhile , the cases of zero and time variable sound speed were respectively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "besides , the eos of the udf models can be specified as some different forms , such as chaplygin gas ( cg ) model and its generalized versions @xcite .",
    "the generalized cg ( gcg ) model keeps highly consistent with the cosmic observations and becomes indistinguishable from the @xmath0cdm model , one can see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to break away from the degeneracy of the udf models ,",
    "a kind of unified model with fast transition in the eos has been put forward in refs .",
    "if the transition is slow , the differences between the udf and @xmath0cdm are negligible . however , if the transition is fast , the model shows some different and interesting features . from the point of dynamics",
    ", the model with fast transition owns a longer matter dominated era than @xmath0cdm , and suddenly enters into a late @xmath0cdm - like epoch .",
    "several works have been devoted to study the features of unified model with fast transition , the viability of a udf model has been analysed by the adiabatic sound speed and the functional form of the squared jeans wave number in refs .",
    "theoretical analysis tells us that a viable unified model allows for the phenomenon of fast transition in the evolution of eos .",
    "additionally , the likelihood analysis on three models with varying eos has been carried out by the cosmic observations in ref .",
    "the results show that the models are not favored over @xmath0cdm by the akaike information criterion .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the models with fast varying eos have been constrained by the so - called cmb shift parameters , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are obtained based on the @xmath0cdm model . on the one hand ,",
    "the values of the cmb shift parameters depend on the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "therefore , the so - called circular problem would come out if one uses these derived data points to constrain other cosmological models .",
    "in fact , the cmb shift parameters would be different for different cosmological models due to different physics process around the last scattering surface , for example early dark energy model ref .",
    "@xcite where the contribution from dark energy may not be neglected due to nontrivial eos of dark energy .",
    "thus , it is dangerous to use the data points due to much departure from @xmath0cdm model . on the other hand ,",
    "the full cmb data points contain more information than the shift parameters .",
    "for instance , at the late epoch when the dark energy is dominated , the gravitational potentials decay and the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) arises .",
    "it affects to the anisotropy power spectra of cmb at large scale ( low @xmath7 parts ) due to the isw effect which is sensitive to the properties of dark energy .",
    "apparently , the cmb shift parameters do not include this information .",
    "one can see ref .",
    "@xcite about the advantages of the full cmb information .    to fill out the gap and avoid the so - called circular problem , in this paper we will not use the derived cmb shift parameters but the full information from wmap 7-yr data points to constrain our unified model with fast transition",
    "one can expect a tight constraint .",
    "furthermore , the entropic perturbations are included in the research process .",
    "the reason why we consider entropic perturbations is that the adiabatic sound speed is not enough to characterize the micro - scale properties .",
    "so , the effective sound speed as a specified model parameter is introduced . for a generalized dark matter",
    ", the effective sound speed was defined in ref .",
    "when the entropic perturbations vanish , the effective sound speed is reduced to the adiabatic sound speed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model with a constant adiabatic sound speed including entropic perturbations was studied , where the effective sound speed was fixed @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , the effective sound speed should be a free model parameter determined by the cosmic observations , one can see ref .",
    "@xcite . following this paper ,",
    "we consider the effective sound speed @xmath9 is a free parameter in the range of @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose a udf model with a fast transition in the eos .",

    "section iv is the conclusion .",

    ", the curve around the transition varies rapidly , this phenomenon is the so - called fast transition .",
    "obviously , the smaller the value of @xmath13 is , the faster the rapidity of transition becomes .    .",
    "the red dotted , green dot - dashed , blue dashed and black solid lines respectively correspond to the case of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the thick orange solid line is the critical state between slow and fast transition.,width=453,height=302 ]    then , we try to define roughly the concept of slow or fast transition from the geometry property of the curve . from the embedded small image in fig .",
