    "several past , present and planned space missions utilize a pair of spacecraft orbiting a celestial body in a tight formation . continuous high - precision range and range - rate measurements between the spacecraft yield detailed information about the gravity field of the target body .",
    "missions of this type include the gravity recovery and climate experiment ( grace ) mission @xcite in orbit around the earth ; the gravity recovery and interior laboratory ( grail ) mission , which comprises two spacecraft in orbit around the moon @xcite ; and planned missions such as a grace follow - on mission or a proposal for a grail - like mission in orbit around mars .    of these , the mission of particular current interest is grail , as the two grail spacecraft are presently ( 2012 ) orbiting the moon . in this paper",
    ", we therefore focus on the grail mission and its science observables .",
    "however , the lessons learned are also applicable to other , similar experiments .    to reach its science objectives ,",
    "the grail mission relies on precision navigation of both spacecraft and accurate range measurements between the two lunar orbiters performed with their on - board ka - band ranging ( kbr ) system .",
    "the instantaneous one - way range measurements performed at each spacecraft are time - tagged and processed on the ground to form dual one - way range ( dowr ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the mission relies on precision timing of all critical events ( using the on - board ultra - stable oscillator , or uso ) related to the transmission and reception of various microwave signals used on grail for formation tracking and navigation .",
    "the resulting time series of highly accurate radio - metric data will allow for a major increase in accuracy when studying the gravity field of the moon .",
    "the differential nature of the science measurements allows for the removal of a number of measurement errors introduced in the process .",
    "in particular , the approach compensates for errors due to long - term instabilities of the on - board usos .",
    "this allows for an improvement in accuracy by about two orders of magnitude when compared to other techniques .",
    "in fact , the anticipated accuracies are of the order of 1  @xmath0 m in range and 1  @xmath0 m/s in range rate .",
    "it was recognized early on during the mission development that due to the expected high accuracy of ranging data on grail , models of its observables must be formulated within the framework of einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "in fact , a naive application of the observable models developed for the grace mission @xcite may have led to significant model discrepancy ( as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as these models do not take into account relativistic contributions that are critical for grail . the ultimate observable model for grail must correctly describe all the timing events occurring during the science operations of the mission , including both the navigation observables ( s- and x - band , @xmath1  ghz and @xmath2  ghz correspondingly ) and inter - spacecraft tracking ( ka - band , @xmath3  ghz ) data .",
    "the model must represent the different times at which the events are computed , involving the time of transmission of the ka - band signal at one of the spacecraft , say grail - a , at @xmath4 , and the reception of this signal by its twin , grail - b , at time @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the model must include a description of the process of transmitting s - band and x - band navigation signals from either spacecraft and reception of this signal at a deep space network ( dsn ) tracking station at time @xmath6 .",
    "we model the range @xmath7 between the two spacecraft @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : grail ] for geometry and notations ) as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vector connecting the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) with the earth - moon barycenter ( emb ) , @xmath12 is the vector from the emb to the moon s ( m ) center of mass , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are vectors connecting the ssb with the positions of the two grail orbiters and vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 connect the moon s center of mass with the orbiters .    for navigation purposes ,",
    "both orbiters maintain communication links with a ground - based dsn antenna .",
    "the range @xmath17 between a grail spacecraft ( grail - a , for instance ) and a ground - based antenna can be modeled as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vector from the emb to the geocenter ( e ) , @xmath20 is the vector connecting the ssb with the ground antenna whereas the vector @xmath21 determines the geocentric position of the ground antenna s reference point .    for actual computations ,",
    "we use several different reference systems .",
    "the solar system barycentric coordinate reference system ( bcrs ) has its origin at the ssb .",
    "the origin of the geocentric coordinate reference system ( gcrs ) is the earth s center of mass",
    ". positions of dsn ground stations are given with respect to another terrestrial coordinate system , the topocentric coordinate reference system ( tcrs ; see also ref .",
    "we also consider the lunicentric coordinate reference system ( lcrs ; for additional discussion , see ref .",

    "each of these coordinate systems has a corresponding time coordinate . to compute the vector sums and differences , all",
    "vectors involved must be converted to a common relativistic space - time reference system .",
    "although in general relativity one can introduce any reference frame to describe the experiment , the best practical choice is offered by some realization of the bcrs .",
    "we will use a realization of the bcrs that is called the ssb reference frame .",
    "the coordinate time associated with the bcrs is tcb ( barycentric coordinate time ) . for practical applications ,",
    "it is often preferable to use another time scale , the tdb ( barycentric dynamical time ) .",
    "currently published planetary ephemerides are provided using tdb .",
    "tdb and tcb differ only by a linear scaling .",
    "the advantage of using tdb is that the difference between it and terrestrial timescales ( e.g. , tt , defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : timekeeping ] ) is as small as possible and periodic .",
    "the choice of the tdb as the ssb time coordinate is realized by the appropriate linear scaling of space coordinates and planetary masses ( see @xcite for review ) .",

    "the theory of general relativity is generally covariant . in the riemannian geometry that underlies the theory ,",
    "coordinate charts are merely labels .",
    "one may choose an arbitrary coordinate system to describe the results of a particular experiment .",
    "space - time coordinates have no direct physical meaning and it is essential to construct physical observables as coordinate - independent quantities .    on the other hand , some of the available coordinate systems have important practical advantages .",
    "these systems are usually associated with a particular celestial body , ground - based facility or spacecraft , thereby yielding a material realization of a reference system to be used to describe the results of precision experiments . in order to interpret the results of observations or experiments",

    "it is also known that an ill - defined reference frame may lead to the appearance of non - physical terms that may significantly complicate the interpretation of the data .",
