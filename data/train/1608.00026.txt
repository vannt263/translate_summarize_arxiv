    "it has been known for some time now that the atmospheres of about 25 - 50% of all white dwarfs are polluted with the presence of metals such as mg , al , si , ca , ti , cr , mn , fe , and ni . the relatively short gravitational settling times of these heavy elements indicate that refractory materials have either been recently deposited onto the surfaces of these stars , or that there is a nearly continual process of the accretion of such material ( e.g. , zuckerman et al .",
    "2010 ; koester et al .",
    "the composition of the pollutants is consistent with the accretion of material from rocky objects rather than cometary bodies ( zuckerman et al .  2007 ;",
    "gnsicke et al .",
    "2012 ; farihi et al .",
    "a smaller , but significant fraction , of these polluted white dwarfs ( zuckerman et al .",
    "1987 ) , are also found to have infrared signatures of dusty disks orbiting them ( kilic et al .",

    "2009 ; barber et al .  2012",
    "; rocchetto et al .",
    "2015 ) . at the present time",
    ", it appears that the most plausible explanation for this pollution is the accretion of rocky bodies that are the collisional or tidal breakup products of asteriods or planetesimals that remain from the white dwarf progenitor ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ; debes et al .  2012 ; mustill et al .  2014 ; veras et al .  2014 ; 2015 )",
    "a significant boost to our understanding of this scenario was made by vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015a ) who reported the discovery of periodic transits of the white dwarf wd 1145 + 017 ( hereafter , wd1145 ) using data from the k2 mission ( howell et al .",
    "vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015a ) detected six distinct periodicities in the k2 data ranging from 4.5 to 4.9 hours ( designated as `` a '' through `` f '' ) .",
    "the folded lightcurves corresponding to these periodicities typically exhibited 1 - 2 hour long dips with depths ranging up to 2% of the mean flux level .",
    "the determination of the transit shapes and depths were limited by the 1/2-hour long - cadence exposure times of k2 and the need to superpose many dips in order to produce a statistically significant signal .",
    "the six periodic signals appeared to be coherent over the @xmath080 days of the k2 observations .",
    "since the k2 discovery there have been a number of follow - up ground - based observations of wd1145 ( vanderburg et al .",
    "2015a ; croll et al .  2015",
    "; gnsicke et al .",
    "2016 ; rappaport et al .",
    "the earlier of these observations ( during 2015 april and may ) found relatively infrequent transits , but with greater depths ( up to 40% ) and more narrow widths of @xmath05 - 10 minutes ( vanderburg et al .",
    "2015a ; croll et al .",
    "the periodicity of these dips was difficult to measure accurately because of the limited coverage , but it was clear that the dips that were observed did not phase up to any of the k2 periodicities .",
    "the later follow - up observations of gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and rappaport et al .",
    "( 2016 ; hereafter r16 ) found a much higher rate of dip activity with a pattern that repeated at 4.5-hour intervals .",
    "these dips reached depths of @xmath060% and were sometimes so numerous that they overlapped to produce broad , i.e. , hour - long , depressions in the flux .",
    "the dips during 2015 november through 2016 january could be tracked coherently over periods of weeks to months , and at least a dozen independent periods in the range of 4.490 to 4.495 hours were identified .",
    "in addition r16 also reported a period of 4.5004 hours that they identified with the k2 ` a ' period .",
    "because of the stability of these periods , it could be concluded that the dust clouds must be emanating continually from sizable bodies , i.e. , with minimum masses of @xmath1 g to maximum masses of that of ceres at @xmath2 g ( see r16 ) .",
    "if there were no such body releasing the dust , the inferred dust clouds would quickly shear out within a few dozen orbits .    in 2015 april , xu et al .",
    "( 2016 ) made high - resolution spectroscopic measurements of wd1145 , and discovered numerous circumstellar metal absorption lines .",
    "the unique and impressive thing about these lines was their broad widths , all of which extended from @xmath3 to + 200 km s@xmath4 .    in an attempt to measure the size of the attenuating dust particles , croll et al .",

    "reflect some of the ideas developed in r16 .",
    "we are neither certain that these notions have been confirmed by the current work , nor have they been ruled out .",
    "we refer to the `` a asteroid '' as a possible few - hundred km body orbiting at the `` a period '' found during the k2 observations at 4.4988 hours ( vanderburg et al .",
    "2015a ; or indistinguishably , 4.5004 hours ) . when we refer to `` a fragments '' these pertain to smaller bodies ( of @xmath01 km size ) that were thought to have broken off the main asteroid body from its l1 point and gone into orbits that are @xmath00.2% shorter in period . in a sense , we use these terms as a shorthand to define the orbital periods , rather than as a full acceptance of the physical scenarios they imply .",

    "[ fig : waterfall00 ] we show in waterfall format , eight representative lightcurves taken throughout the 8 months of our observations .",
    "note that at all times over the course of the 8 months the dips were sufficiently deep to be accurately recorded by our relatively small aperture telescopes .",
    "the first lightcure , in november , has the most dip activity , and the last one shown , in july , has the least .",
    "starting in january most dips are found at the same phase . whereas the day - to - day lightcurves ( see fig .",
    "2 ) exhibit similar structures , allowing identification of the same dip in each , which enables drift direction and rate to be measured , on monthly timescales the dip structure is poorly correlated .",
    "an advantage of this `` traditional '' waterfall format is that it shows dip structure and depth clearly . but",
    "a shortcoming is that it can not accommodate large numbers of lightcurves without becoming very cluttered looking .",
    "also , precise phase locations are not easily determined without a fitting function , and this information is needed for the measurement of drift rates ( i.e. , orbital periods ) .",
    "figure [ fig : waterfall ] is a waterfall diagram of a different format . here",
    ", each dip is replaced by a bar whose length is the dip scale length , @xmath16 + @xmath17 , and whose thickness is proportional to the dip depth ( both as determined from the ahs fits ) .",
    "this type of waterfall diagram can accommodate large numbers of lightcurves , covering a long interval of dates ; 8 months for this case .",
    "it also assigns time to the y - axis with date increasing in the upward direction .",
    "the x - axis is orbital phase , using an ephemeris with bjdo = 2457347.9931 and p = 4.5004 hrs .",
    "this ephemeris was not only suggested by the most prominent periodic component of variation in the k2 data , the ` a ' period , but it was the most prominent component in the first half of the data analyzed in r16 .",
    "in such a waterfall plot the ` a ' asteroid passes in front of the wd star on every orbit at the same phase , suggested in this diagram by a red line at phase + 0.12 .",
    "if the inclination of the asteroid s orbit were close enough to @xmath20 so that it crossed in front of the wd , it would produce a transit at times corresponding to the vertical red line .",
    "since the asteroid is very much smaller than the star , these transits are not expected to be directly observable ( e.g. , because dips would be much less than 1% ) .",
    "however , if dust clouds were present close to the asteroid , and if the opaque portions of them were sufficiently large , every time the asteroid passed in front of the wd a transit fade event , or dip , would be observed .",
    "dips would then be confined close to the vertical red line .",
    "instead of observing this type of pattern , we observe dips that form a pattern of lines branching off the red line and drifting to the upper - left .",
    "this was the pattern observed during the entire observational interval covered by the r16 study .",
    "r16 explained this using a model in which fragments of the asteroid left the end facing the star ( the l1 end , since we hypothesized that the asteroid s hill sphere had shrunk to the size of the asteroid during an inward migration ) .",
    "since the fragments went into orbits with slightly smaller semi - major axes they completed their orbits slightly ahead of the asteroid , so any dust clouds that were generated by the fragments would produce transits occurring earlier with each orbit than the asteroid s passage in front of the star .",
    "several such `` drift lines '' are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] .",
    "r16 identified 15 drift lines , and provided a table of their associated periods .",
    "some drift lines begin close to the red line , and these are presumably caused by fragments that become active in producing dust clouds immediately upon breaking away from the asteroid .",
    "other drift lines begin at phases corresponding to days or weeks later than their hypothetical fragment breakaway date , defined as the date when the drift line projects backward in time to the red line .",
    "drift lines require @xmath090 days to complete a full phase cycle ( i.e. , lapping the asteroid ) . with this model",
    ", the explanation for a drift line appearing @xmath045 days after a presumed breakaway date , for example , is that it remained `` dormant '' for @xmath045 days before it began to produce a dust cloud ( i.e. , sufficiently large and opaque to produce observable dips ) .",
    "the vertically oriented box in fig .  [ fig : waterfall ] , located on the left of the vertical red line , includes many of the dips prior to mid - january 2016 . according to the model just described",
    ", these dips would be fragments that became active soon after breaking away from the asteroid . since most of them had reduced activity by the time they drifted about 0.1 phase units to the left there is a fall - off of dip activity for phases @xmath21 .",
    "this pattern accounts for the r16 detection of a strong periodicity at the k2 ` a ' period .",
    "something significant in the waterfall diagram changed on about 2016.01.21 ( it is just a coincidence that this is the cut - off date for observations that were included in r16 ) . on the assumption that the breakaway model described in r16 is correct , on this date a large group of fragments appears to have broken away , and the fragments in this group produce dips with a group drift pattern that has lasted for the 6 months that remained for the observational coverage of this work .",
    "this group of dips will be referred to as g6121 ( i.e. , g = group , 6 = 2016 , 1 = january , 21 = 21st day ) .",
    "their drift rate corresponds to a period of @xmath04.4912 hrs ( see also croll et al .",
    "another interesting thing to note is that when g6121 appeared there was a cessation of new individual breakaway events .",
    "it is not clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] that any distinct drift lines exist for the dips within g6121 since the dip symbols are too close together to see such a pattern . fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall2 ] is an expanded version for a 2-month date range starting with the g6121 creation date .",

    "waterfall ] , in late april , at phase @xmath220.5 , a group of dips appear , labeled g6420 .",
    "the 3 or 4 drift lines for this group have different slopes , and all of them are rotated clockwise with respect to the g6121 slope , signifying that they have longer periods than the long - lived g6121 group .",
    "the g6420 group is treated in the next section .",

    "it uses an ephemeris suggested by an initial analysis of the g6121 drift rate ( p = 4.4916 hrs ) . by using this period",
    "the drift lines appear close to vertical , which makes it easier to identify dip associations .",
    "the drift lines near zero phase are long - lasting , and many of the drift lines are nearly parallel .",

    "four drift lines are identified , and they all begin at y = 111 ( 2106.04.20 ) , x ( phase ) = + 0.36 .",
    "this group of dips illustrates what we suggested might be possible in r16 , namely that the date for the simultaneous creation of a group of fragments ( possibly due to a collision ) can be determined by backward extrapolation of drift lines to a date where they converge . in this case , however , no backward extrapolation is required , nor is a creation date conjecture necessary .",
    "even if observations had not been made until a few days after this group s first appearance a backward projection would still have yielded a fairly accurate creation date .",
    "the drift lines can be referred to with letters appending their group name , e.g. , g6420a , b , c and d. dip ` d ' fades to unobservable status first , after 13 days .",
    "the other dips last longer , as much as 21 days for `` b '' .",
    "dip ` d ' has a slope requiring a period almost as long as the ` a'-asteroid s period .",
    "if the ` d ' fragment s orbit is eccentric it could conceivably impact the ` a ' asteroid .",
    "the existence of `` b '' is the least certain because its dip features are close to the `` a '' dips and there are only 4 occasions that they were identified as a separate dip feature .",
    "figure [ fig : waterfall3 ] shows the abrupt appearance of a dip on apr 26 and phase + 0.55 .",
    "it is very brief , but deep .",
    "this is the same dip shown in the fig",
    ". 1 lightcurve at 22.7 ut , and also in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] ( starting with the 3rd lightcurve from bottom ) .",
    "the dip was found to move to greater phases at a high rate , corresponding to a period of @xmath23 hrs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bperiod ] .",
    "we refer to this dip as the `` b dip '' because it has a period almost exactly the same as the kepler k2 ` b ' period ( vanderburg et al , 2015a ) .",
    "our interpretation of this dip feature is that it is either a fragment that broke off an asteroid having a period close to the k2 ` b ' period , or it is the ` b ' period asteroid itself that is producing a dust cloud .",
    "for each dip that can be associated with other dips in a waterfall diagram for many dates , i.e. , producing a `` drift line , '' it is possible to determine how the dip properties vary during its lifetime .",
    "one such characterization is a quantity which we define as the `` equivalent width '' ( ` ew ' ) , i.e. , the integral under the dip curve , which we approximate as the product of the depth , @xmath15 , times the sum of the ingress time , @xmath16 , and egress time , @xmath17 , multiplied by a numerical factor of 0.79 , where the latter factor is needed to produce the correct result when using the ahs model ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : ahs ] ) : @xmath24 here we have normalized ew by an orbital period of @xmath04.5 hours so as to make ew dimensionless .",
    "if the portion of the dust cloud that transited in front of the wd were optically thin , then ew would be proportional to the projected area of all dust particles ( assuming that their circumferences are greater than @xmath0 one wavelength , i.e. , approaching a scattering cross section roughly equal to the geometric area of the grains ) .",
    "in particular , one can show that ew @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total grain area passing in front of the wd , @xmath27 is the radius of the wd , and @xmath28 is the orbital distance of the dust cloud .    as an example , we can describe the ew history of one dip sequence belonging to the g6121 group that appeared on 2016.02.03 and was present for almost all of the rest of the observing sessions , an interval of 4 months .",
    "figure [ fig : dip17_history ] shows the ew history for this dip vs.  date .",
    "note the turn - on time at day 32 ( doy = day of year for 2016 ) which is our suggested origin date for dip activity .",
    "after some variation , the ew is observed to undergo an abrupt rise at doy = 125 .",
    "the two sudden increases in the ew are consistent with the collision hypothesis for dust cloud creation .    in studying the dip histories of all the dip features for wd1145 , we have seen that , thus far , no dips deeper than 60% have been measured .",
    "either the dust clouds have not been opaque enough to produce deeper dips , or they are opaque and have not covered more than 60% of the stellar disk of the wd .",
    "these two extreme cases can be thought of as `` optically thin '' and `` optically thick '' models .",
    "knowing which of these alternatives to model , or what combination of them to employ , will be part of any analysis attempting to quantify dust production and loss mechanisms .",
    "the shape of the dips can sometimes differ for the two alternatives ( see discussion in alonso et al .",
    "many dips have begun with sharp structures ( e.g. , @xmath03 minutes wide and @xmath050% deep ) , but none of them in the present archive can be characterized with certainty to be `` flat - bottomed '' , as would be expected in a hard - body transit .",
    "detailed modeling of dip structures will be justified when larger aperture telescopes produce an archive of lightcurves with better snr than those in the present archive .    with 776 measured dips , and some 40 drift lines identified during the 8 months of observations , it is possible to characterize numerous drift line behaviors in the manner illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dip17_history ] .",
    "a complete description of the different behaviors , as well as modeling thick and thin dust clouds , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "one statistic that can readily be formed from all the measured dips , regardless of which dip feature they belong to , is a correlation between the dip egress times and the ingress times .",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : taus ] such a correlation .",
    "the first thing we see from this figure is that the median values of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are about 2.2 min .",
    "the ` duration ' , @xmath29 , of the dip can be expressed in terms of the parameters of the ahs model as : @xmath30 from which we conclude that the median dip duration is about 9 min .",
    "finally , we note that for a @xmath31-ratio defined to be @xmath32 there are somewhat more data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : taus ] with high @xmath31-ratios ( > 1.05 ) than low @xmath31-ratios ( < 0.95 ) , indicating a slight tendency for egress times to be longer than ingress times .",
    "in fact , there are 360 high @xmath31-ratio points vs. only 262 low @xmath31-ratio ones .",
    "this is significant at the 4-@xmath33 level , and we take it to be a real effect ( see also r16 ) .",
    "we can use the fitted ahs parameters for all of the lightcurves to derive a measure of the total source ` activity ' vs.  time over the course of our 8 months of observations .",
    "we accomplish this by computing the ew of the lightcurves ( i.e. , the `` area under the curve '' , as defined above ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this definition of `` equivalent width '' as `` activity level '' .",
    "note that the ew parameter is dimensionless and has values between zero and 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : activity1 ] shows `` equivalent width '' dip activity versus date for the 8-month interval of this study .",
    "activity begins at a high level in 2015 november , decreases to a low value in mid - february , rises to a similar high level in late april , after which it undergoes an apparent monotonic decrease that continues until the last observation date in july .",
    "figure [ fig : activity2 ] shows the same data on a log scale , for a 2-year interval in order to include the _ kepler _ k2 observations and follow - up ground - based observations reported by vanderburg et al ( 2015a ) and croll et al ( 2015 ) . as described in r16 , the _ kepler _ k2 discovery observations , as well as the follow - up ground - based observations in 2015 , were made when the `` dip activity '' was at a low level .",
    "when amateurs started observing in 2015 november the dip activity level was @xmath025 times greater .",
    "this dramatic rise in activity must have occurred between june and october of 2015 .",
    "our search for periodicities in the data train consisted of three different approaches . in the first",
    ", we subjected the data to a box least squares ( bls ) transform ( kovacs et al , 2002 ) .",
    "the results are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bls ] .",
    "what we see is a prominent peak with a frequency of 5.34385 cycles / day , with a frequency resolution of 0.0083 cycles / day , but with an uncertainty in determining the peak frequency of only 0.00042 cycles / day .",
    "this corresponds to a period of @xmath34 hours .",
    "all of the other highly significant peaks in the bls transform are associated with either this frequency , its higher harmonics , subharmonics , or their beat frequencies with the 1-day observing cycle .    the second period search consisted of brute force testing of @xmath35 trial periods against our fitted times of dips ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : ahs ] ) . for each trial period",
    "we checked whether the time interval between each distinct pair of dips was equal to an integer number of trial periods .",
    "we allowed for a plus or minus 2% leeway in terms of matching an integral number of cycles .",
    "the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : bls ] shows the number of `` matches '' for each trial frequency .",
    "this transform , which we call `` interval match transform '' ( ` imt ' ) , bears a remarkable similarity with the bls transform , and even has a higher signal - to - noise ratio at the peak at 4.49114 hours ( the same period determined from the bls analysis ) .",
    "the third approach for determining periodicities in the data involves direct inspection of the waterfall diagram . associating a series of dips and calling them a drift line",
    "was done `` by eye ''",
    "- i.e. , subjectively .",
    "usually a minimum of 4 dips had to be `` aligned '' for them to be considered .",
    "inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] to [ fig : waterfall3a ] illustrates the result of this process .",
    "r16 also addresses this subjective procedure , where a list of periods is given for dates before 2016.01.25 .",
    "figure [ fig : pfrag ] shows periods based on drift line slopes for the entire 8-month set of observations ( i.e. , shown in fig .  [ fig : waterfall ] ) .",
    "we find that all the periods in this plot lie between 4.4870 and 4.5012 hours , a range of only 0.3% .",
    "this corresponds to orbital radii that are the same to within 0.2% .",
    "if we remove the 6 periods farthest from the mean , then the remaining @xmath085% of the periods all lie between 4.490 and 4.496 , a range of only 0.13% , corresponding to orbits within an extraordinarily narrow ring of only 0.1% in width .",
    "during the 8-month observing period ending on 2016.07.13 ( the cut - off date for observations included in this work ) wd1145 produced four significant surprises : ( 1 ) a dramatic increase in `` activity '' occurred sometime between 2015 june and october , causing dip levels to be @xmath025 times greater than during the k2 observations of one year earlier as well as the follow - up ground - based observations during the first half of 2015 . ( 2 ) in mid - january 2016 the dip pattern of activity changed from a steady production of short - lived dips originating at the presumed ` a'-asteroid location to a cessation of such activity ; at the same time , a large number of longer - lived dips appeared in an inner ` a'-fragment orbit .",
    "( 3 ) on 2016 april 21 a group of 3 or 4 dips appeared at a phase that we interpret as corresponding to a location far from the ` a'-asteroid .",
    "these dips had a relatively large range of periods , and their drift lines radiated from their origin date .",
    "this demonstrates that when drift lines are observed long after the origin of the dust clouds producing the dips it is possible to infer a creation date by projecting drift lines backward in time to a convergence date of presumed origin .",
    "( 4 ) on april 26 , 2016 a dip suddenly appeared that repeated with a period corresponding to the k2 ` b'-period , with p = 4.6064 hours .",
    "this validates the existence of an asteroid at the ` b'-period orbit , and provides indirect support for the existence of the ` c ' through ` f ' asteroids .",
    "whenever observing sessions were long enough to observe more than one 4.5-hour orbital cycle , we always observed a near repeat of the dip pattern from the previous orbit ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1 ) . that is ,",
    "changes in the dips typically take numerous orbits , or even days to develop .",
    "some dips are recognizable ( i.e. , identifiable ) for up to several months .",
    "this indicates a certain stability to the dust clouds which strongly suggests that the dust can not be formed at a single instant , with the resultant dust cloud surviving as a discrete feature for many orbits .",
    "the argument against such a scenario is the following .",
    "consider a dust cloud that forms and grows to have a characteristic size that is comparable to that of the white dwarf . in that case",
    ", the cloud size likely extends in the radial direction ( i.e. , toward and away from the wd ) by a distance that is of the order of 1% its orbital radius . in turn",
    ", this means that the spread in orbital frequencies is @xmath01.5% of the mean orbital frequency . in that case",
    ", the dust cloud would spread out along its orbit by 360@xmath36 in about 65 orbits .",
    "however , most of the observed dips have a duration much less than one hour , which is only @xmath020% of an orbital cycle .",
    "this would occur within @xmath0 a dozen orbits , or within a couple of days .",
    "since we are able to track many of the dip features for weeks , to even months in a few cases , this implies that the dust must be at least partly continually produced .",
    "whether this dust production is due to sublimation from the molten surfaces of asteroids , or a nearly continuous bombardment of an asteroid by smaller bodies , including micrometeorites , is a matter that will not be addressed in this work .",
    "collisions between solid bodies can lead to the sudden creation of a dust cloud for two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the collision may produce debris with a particle - size distribution that extends down to micron - size dust .",
    "( 2 ) fresh surfaces are exposed to irradiation from the wd which leads to further heating , melting , and sublimation . the sudden appearance of a dip , or the sudden increase in an existing dip s depth , are candidates for the collision interpretation .    the 2016 april 20 group of dips , g6420 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : waterfall3a ] ) , is most easily explained by a fragment / fragment collision .",
    "the dips appeared without the presence of dips at their phase location on earlier dates , so the dust clouds associated with each fragment were new .",
    "each of the four major fragments was observed to orbit with a different period , and this indicates that they gained or lost specific orbital angular momentum and/or energy due to the collision .",
    "the case for a fragment / fragment collision is based on the location of the dips far from the ` a ' asteroid s orbital position .    the 25-fold increase in dip activity that occurred sometime between 2015",
    "june and october is another good candidate for the collision explanation .",
    "we suggest that a fragment may have undergone a change in its orbital eccentricity due to a nearby passage with another fragment , or even the ` a ' asteroid , and the new orbit then had an apastron distance that was close to the asteroid s orbit .",
    "in such a scenario it would be possible for the fragment to collide with the ` a ' asteroid , and this could initiate the release of new fragments from the asteroid .    if this explanation is correct then we would expect to see a diverging pattern of dip drift lines , analogous to what was seen for the g6420 group . indeed , as shown by fig .",
    "6 in the r16 paper , a waterfall plot using the ` a'-fragment ephemeris , 14 drift lines do in fact diverge from a date preceding the 2015 november start of observations ( they project backward to a date region near 2015 august and september ) .",
    "finally , individual dips can undergo a sudden depth increase , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : dip17_history ] .",
    "these depth increases could be due to collisions with small fragments , or possibly a dust cloud that produces an increase in micrometeoroid impacts .",
    "other mechanisms which could produce sudden increases in dust production rate are possible , but such a discussion is beyond the scope of this work .      the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) described in vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015a ) requires a debris disk to account for the near - ir flux measurements ( wise ch1 and ch2 , at 3.4 and 4.6 micron wavelength ) .",
    "a best fit was achieved when the disk had a brightness temperature of @xmath01145 k and a projected optically thick area @xmath0116 times that of the wd disk .",
    "what is the connection between the particles in the debris disk and the dust clouds that produce observable dips ? even observing 776 dips , as we have in this work , will not answer this interesting question .    from the orbital period of the dust clouds , combined with the estimated wd mass and radius",
    ", we know that the dust clouds orbit at a distance from the wd of @xmath094 wd radii . if the ` a'-fragments are coplanar with the debris disk , we can ask if they define the inner edge of the debris disk .",
    "if this is the case , then fig .",
    "15 would be a depiction of such a geometry .",
    "the asteroids presumed to exist corresponding to the k2 periods ` b ' through ` f ' would then be within the debris disk .",
    "the dashed trace in the lower panel is at the ` f'-asteroid location , at 108 wd radii .",
    "the upper panel shows how such a debris disk would be viewed from earth if the inclination were @xmath37 .",
    "this combination of inclination and inner / outer radii correspond to the required projected area for an optically thick disk ( with a brightness temperature of 1145 k ) to produce the measured ir excess fluxes .",
    "the diagram also corresponds to a geometry in which the orbits of the ` a'-asteroid , and its fragments , project close to one pole of the wd .",
    "if this geometry is correct , then when a fragment produces a dust cloud only half of it transits in front of the wd disk .",
    "there are many uncertainties associated with this model , and it is beyond the scope of this paper to address them . the purpose for this figure is to suggest how future modeling will be intimately connected to the 776 dips analyzed in this work .",
    "the k2 observations included @xmath0860 wds whose flux light curves were analyzed in a manner similar to that for wd1145 , but the wd1145 dips remain unique ( a. vanderburg , 2015b , and private communication 2016 ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that only a fraction , @xmath38 , of wds with @xmath39 @xmath40 , 90% confidence range ) meet the dual conditions of being orbited by dust clouds and having inclinations close enough to 90@xmath36 for any dust clouds that are present to be observed as transit dips .",
    "if 1% of inclinations are acceptable for producing transits when dust clouds are present , then perhaps @xmath04%-55% of wds ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) may have orbiting dust clouds .",
    "this statistic is compatible with the finding that 25 to 50% of wds have spectra exhibiting atmospheric pollution by metal absorption lines .",
    "we do not know what fraction of the time such stars exhibit dramatic increases in activity , such as the 25-fold one that we observed for wd1145 as event `` 1 '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : activity2 ] ) , but if it is 10% , for example , then among the 13,000 known wds there should be @xmath0@xmath42 wds ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) currently undergoing high levels of dust - produced transit activity .",
    "future surveys will be able to provide a more accurate estimate of how often wds with dust clouds exhibit the kind of easily observed , high levels of activity reported in this paper for an 8-month observing interval .      among the four surprise events mentioned above ,",
    "three were identified and well documented because the lightcurve observations of this work were frequent , sometimes with a daily cadence ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] and [ fig : activity1 ] ) .",
    "such monitoring is feasible for non - professional observers , provided dip depths exceeding @xmath03% are present and are sufficient for characterizing dip activity .",
    "this was the situation beginning after the 2015 october announcement that wd1145 was being transited by dust clouds , and it was superb good luck that when amateur observations began ( 2015.11.01 ) the dip activity level was suitably high for useful amateur observation and frequent monitoring .",
    "wd1145 has the prospect of becoming a regular target for advanced amateurs , and for pro / am collaborations .",
    "part of the appeal for dedicated observation is that the lightcurves change very often and dramatic surprises can be expected to occur several times a year during the heightened activity state .",
    "wd1145 activity has been gradually decreasing since late april , 2016 , and at the time of this writing ( 2016 july ) wd1145 may be returning to the low levels of activity observed by _",
    "kepler _ during the k2 mission .",
    "amateurs are capable of monitoring this decline , and also detecting the next dramatic rise to heightened activity .",
    "such monitoring is possible during the yearly observing season ( november to july ) on a daily basis , or weekly if activity level has been low for a long time , and this could be accomplished at practically no cost !",
    "it is reasonable to assume that amateurs can be counted upon to perform this role in the near - future .",
    "in this work we have documented the photometric behavior of wd1145 during an 8-month period of high dip activity .",
    "the total data set comprises 158 lightcurves collected over the 8-month interval during which we detected @xmath0700 significant dips in flux .",
    "we present an illustrative set of the lightcurves which show how the dips vary from night to night and from month to month .",
    "we use these to construct ` waterfall diagrams ' , which in turn allow us to track specific repeatable dip features in the lightcurves over substantial periods of times ( days to months ) . the features that can be tracked lead to precise orbital periods of the bodies responsible for producing the dust , which we infer to be fragments of asteroids .",
    "during the 8-month interval , we observed several very notable changes in the dip behavior .",
    "first , in 2016 january a large number of dust clouds appeared that had an orbital period of approximately 4.4912 hours .",
    "this event marked the end of a 3-month interval of short - lived dips that produced an apparent 4.5004-hour periodicity which previous studies had associated with the _ kepler _",
    "k2 ` a ' period .",
    "the second noteworthy event was a 2016 april 21 appearance of four dip features with drift lines in a waterfall diagram that diverged from their origin date and lasted for about two weeks .",
    "these dips appeared at a location in the orbit that can not be explained as fragments that had just broken away from the ` a ' asteroid .",
    "the third event was the sudden appearance of a dip feature with a period of 4.6064 hours , which we associate with the kepler k2 ` b ' period .",
    "this period had not been detected since the original k2 observations .",
    "we made use of the quantitative dip properties in two ways .",
    "first , we defined an  equivalent width \" ( ` ew ' ) to all the dips in a given orbit  basically the integrated area under the normalized flux lightcurve . in this way",
    ", we could quantitatively follow the dip ` activity ' as a function of time for both individual recognizable dip features and for all the dips during an orbit .",
    "we found that during most of our observations the overall dip activity level was more than an order of magnitude higher than during the time it was discovered with k2 ; however , by the end of our observations the dip activity had declined to a level close to its original state .",
    "the simplest model that accounts for wd1145 s behavior during the past 2 years is one in which an asteroid orbits close to the wd , and fragments that had earlier broken away from the inner end of the asteroid , are in orbits slightly smaller than the asteroid s orbit ( as suggested in r16 ) . we hypothesize that most of the time there are shallow dips produced by dust clouds emanating from old fragments .",
    "as we have argued , the dust is likely caused by a quasi - continuous production mechanism such as sublimation , micrometeroid bombardment , or another as yet unrecognized process .",
    "occasionally a fragment passes close to another fragment in a way that increases its orbital eccentricity , and if the apastron distance is as large as the asteroid s orbit it may eventually collide with the `` mother asteroid . '' the fragment / asteroid collision will initiate a phase of heightened dust production activity from a new population of fragments with fresh surfaces .",
    "although a few fragment / fragment collisions may occur , creating diverging dip drift patterns , most of the evolution in dip depth and width will be caused by changes in the quasi - continual dust production , e.g. , due to variations in the sublimation rate leading to the formation of the dust grains .",
    "the dust clouds , once formed , are then subject to dissipation via orbital shearing motion as well as radiation pressure . as fragments `` age '' their dust production decreases , and on a timescale of about a year the dip activity level returns to the pre - fragment / asteroid collision level .",
    "years or decades may pass until another fragment / asteroid collision initiates the next episode of heightened activity .",
    "according to this scenario it was fortunate that wd1145 s high activity coincided with an amateur observing project .",
    "if the heightened activity had occurred a year earlier only professional telescopes would have been in use for photometric observing , and the frequency of lightcurve observations might have been inadequate for the quality of characterization that is reported here .",
    "if the trend of decreasing activity since 2016 april continues , by the start of the next observing season ( november 2016 ) wd1145 will have returned to _ kepler _",
    "k2 observing date levels , i.e. , with dip depths of only a few percent . continued amateur monitoring can be counted on to provide news of the next outburst of heightened activity .",
    "given the exciting developments following the discovery of wd1145 , the notion that wds with `` polluted atmospheres '' ( i.e. , exhibiting metal - line absorption spectra ) are orbited by asteroid - size bodies in a way resembling wd1145 , becomes ever more compelling .",
    "it is also quite reasonable to assume that approximately 1% of such systems are oriented so that the asteroid and its fragments transit the wd ( orbital inclination @xmath5 89 degrees ) .",
    "however , it is not known how often such wds exhibit the same high level of dip activity that was encountered during the 8 months of observations described in this work . the presence of dips with 1 or 2% depth , as measured by _",
    "kepler , _ may be the most common state . therefore , as we argued , it is plausible that of the @xmath013,000 known wds , there may indeed be a handful that are currently in the dipping state of wd1145 .",
    "data files for the 6 months of observations of this work , plus the 2.5 months of observations reported on in the r16 publication , are available upon request from author blg .",
    "these files include normalized flux for each lightcurve data point , for each of the 158 lightcurves , as well as their 776 dip solutions ( bjd , depth , @xmath44 , observer and telescope for each dip ) .",
    "web page urls are also available from blg that show all lightcurves in great detail and in several formats .",
