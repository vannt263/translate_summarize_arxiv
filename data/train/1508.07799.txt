    "homodyne detection is an experimental method that is used to reconstruct quantum states of coherent light by repeatedly measuring a discrete set of field quadratures @xcite .",
    "usually , a very high detection efficiency and ad - hoc designed apparatuses with low electronic noise are required @xcite .",
    "new methods capable of discriminating between different quantum states of light , even with low detection efficiencies , will pave the road to the application of quantum homodyne detection for studying different physical systems embedded in a high noise environment @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , specific quantum statistical methods , based on minimax and adaptive estimation of the wigner function , have been developed in @xcite .",
    "these approaches allow for the efficient reconstruction of the wigner function under any noise condition , at the price of acquiring larger amounts of data .",
    "hence , they overcome the limits of more conventional pattern function quantum tomography @xcite . the important consequence of this novel statistical approach is that the @xmath0 detection efficiency threshold can be overcome and quantum tomography is still practicable when the signals are measured with appropriate statistics .",
    "the scope of this paper is to report the results of this method tested by performing numerical experiments .",
    "indeed , we consider a linear superposition of two coherent states and numerically generate homodyne data according to the corresponding probability distribution distorted by an independent gaussian noise simulating efficiencies lower than @xmath0 . by properly expanding the set of numerically generated data ,",
    "we are able to reconstruct the wigner function of the linear superposition within errors that are compatible with the theoretical bounds .",
    "our results support the theoretical indications that homodyne reconstruction of linear superposition of quantum states is indeed possible also at efficiencies lower than 0.5 .",
    "let us consider a quantum system with one degree of freedom described by the hilbert space @xmath1 of square integrable functions @xmath2 over the real line .",
    "the most general states of such a system are density matrices @xmath3 , namely convex combinations of projectors @xmath4 onto normalised vector states @xmath5 any density matrix @xmath3 can be completely characterised by the associated wigner function @xmath6 on the phase - space @xmath7 ; namely , by the non positive - definite ( pseudo ) distribution defined by @xmath8=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}{\\rm d}u\\,{\\rm e}^{i\\,u\\,p}\\,\\left < q - v/2\\vert\\hat{\\rho}\\vert q+v/2\\right>\\ . \\label{wigner}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the position and momentum operators obeying the commutation relations @xmath11=i$ ] , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are eigenstates of @xmath14 : @xmath15 .",

    "\\label{wigner1}\\ ] ] indeed , by direct inspection one finds @xmath20 in homodyne detection , a monochromatic signal photon state is mixed with a coherent reference state , a so - called local oscillator , by a @xmath21 beam splitter . the output",
    "is collected by two photodiodes and the difference photocurrent is measured .",
    "it can be proved that , when the local oscillator is significantly more intense than the signal , the homodyne photocurrent is proportional to the signal quadrature @xcite . denoting by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the single mode annihilation and creation operators associated with the signal ,",
    "the quadrature operator is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the relative phase between signal and local oscillator .",
    "the continuum set of quadratures with @xmath26 $ ] provides a complete characterization of the signal state . using the annihilation and creation operators @xmath27 one constructs position and momentum - like operators , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . with respect to the latter ,",
    "the quadrature operator reads : @xmath30 quadrature operators have continuous spectrum extending over the whole real line , @xmath31 ; given a generic one - mode photon state associated with a density matrix @xmath3 , its diagonal elements with respect to the ( pseudo ) eigenvectors @xmath32 represent the probability distribution over the quadrature spectrum .    in homodyne detection experiments the collected data consist of @xmath33 pairs of quadrature amplitudes and phases @xmath34 :",
    "these can be considered as independent , identically distributed stochastic variables .",
    "given the probability density @xmath35 , one could reconstruct the wigner function by substituting the integration with a sum over the pairs for a sufficiently large number of data .",

    "<S> standard quantum state reconstruction techniques indicate that a detection efficiency of @xmath0 is an absolute threshold below which quantum interferences can not be measured </S>",
    "<S> . however , alternative statistical techniques suggest that this threshold can be overcome at the price of increasing the statistics used for the reconstruction . in the following we present numerical experiments proving that quantum interferences can be measured even with a detection efficiency smaller than @xmath0 . at the same time we provide a guideline for handling the tomographic reconstruction of quantum states based on homodyne data collected by low efficiency detectors . </S>"
