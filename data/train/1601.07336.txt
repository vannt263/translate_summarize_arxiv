    "in the past a few years , inspired by advances in @xmath0-norm and @xmath1-norm techniques , sparse representation@xcite has been widely applied in computer vision , such as image segmentation@xcite , image deblurring@xcite and face recognition@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that wright _",
    "et al_. proposed a sparse representation based classification(src ) @xcite to classify facial images , which is the first time to exploit the discriminative nature of sparse represeor face recognition .",
    "in fact , facial images have a high dimensionality , which usually lie on a low - dimensional subspace or sub - manifold .",
    "thus , yang _ et al_. @xcite proposed a novel dimensionality reduction method that adopts src as a criterion to steer the design of a feature extraction method .",
    "in addition , many high - dimensional data in real world may be better modeled by nonlinear manifolds . to overcome the nonlinear obstruction , some researches suggest to map these data into a kernel feature space by using some nonlinear mapping , and then src is performed in this new feature space by utilizing kernel trick @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , most of the above work mainly focuses on the problem associated with vector - valued data .",
    "the higher - order signals like images ( 2d , 3d or higher ) have to be dealt with primarily by vectorizing them and applying any of the available vector techniques . as a result",
    ", such type vector features can not efficiently characterize the high - dimensional data in computer vision , machine learning and medical image analysis@xcite . concretely , in traditional sparse representation based classification , the sparsity representation for each query image is attained by a dictionary composed of all gallery data across all classes in a _ linear combination _ way .",
    "recent advance@xcite suggests that encoding images through symmetric positive definite ( spd ) matrices and then interpreting such matrices as points on riemannian manifolds can lead to promising classification performance .",
    "for instance , the human facial images are regarded as samples from a nonlinear sub - manifold@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the _ linear combination _ is not applicable to this case where data may be better modeled by nonlinear manifolds @xcite@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the direct applications of linear combination model to matrix - valued data will result in the comprised performance as inaccurate representation .",
    "consequently , the traditional src is also no longer available to classification on spd matrices as points on riemannian manifolds .    to address this problem ,",
    "a few solutions have been recently proposed to generalize sparse coding problems to riemannian manifolds , such as @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the most common approach is to calculate the tangent space to the manifold at the mean of the data points so as to obtain a euclidean approximation of the manifold@xcite .",
    "inspired by this idea , ho _",
    "et al_. @xcite firstly proposed a nonlinear generalization of sparse coding to handle the non - linearity of riemannian manifolds , via flattening a spd manifold using a fixed tangent space . in order to further measure the representation error effectively , in @xcite ,",
    "a tensor sparse coding framework was proposed for positive definite matrices based on the log - determinant divergence ( burg loss ) . instead of using extrinsic similarity measures as work@xcite , the authors@xcite proposed to use the intrinsic riemannian distance on the manifold of spd matrices .",
    "although locally flattening riemannian manifolds via tangent spaces can handle their non - linearity , it inevitably leads to very demanding computation due to switching back and forth between tangent spaces and the manifold@xcite .",
    "furthermore , linear reconstruction of spd matrices is not as natural as in euclidean space and this may incur errors @xcite . on the other line , to address this nonlinear problems via lrr , a nonlinear lrr model is proposed to extend the traditional lrr from euclidean space to stiefel manifold @xcite , spd manifold @xcite and abstract grassmann manifold @xcite respectively .",
    "low - rank representation based method , however , often suffers from high computational complexities as the nuclear norm regularized optimizing . from this view point",
    ", sparse representation based method can readily reduce the computational complexities greatly due to only solving @xmath0-norm optimization problems rather than nuclear - norm ones .",
    "the existing sparse representation methods on spd matrices can been shown to be effective for classification@xcite@xcite , however , there still remain questions about classification in the multiple sub - manifolds setting@xcite with sparse representation . as spd matrices are often that low - dimensional data embedded in high - dimensional non - euclidean spaces , their underlying sub - manifolds are geodesic and referred to riemannian multi - manifolds .",
    "let @xmath2 be a spd matrix and hence a point on @xmath3 , it can be assumed residing on the tubular neighborhood of some unknown geodesic sub - manifold @xmath4 , of a riemannian manifold . as for this issue ,",
    "sparse representation based classification @xcite@xcite has not been sufficiently explored yet .",
    "another reason , may not trivial , the sparse coding coefficients may vary a lot even for similar query samples in classification task as the mechanism of @xmath1-minimization . as a result , the unsatisfied recognition rate will be achieved .",
    "motivated by these observations , in this paper , we propose a neighborhood preserved sparse representation for robust classification on spd matrices .",
    "when encoding the query sample , we aim to use the training samples lying in its vicinity as the training samples and the query sample may reside in the same sub - manifold leading to a better classification performance . despite its simplicity",
    ", the proposed method performs well for classification task . specifically , to thoroughly exploit the intrinsic geometry among data on riemannian manifold , a neighborhood preserved prior induced from the geodesic distance , besides the sparsity ,",
    "is imposed on the sparse coefficients so that the similar query data produce similar sparse codes .",
    "the main contributions in our paper are summarized below .    1 .   to our best knowledge , it is the first attempts to formulate the local consistency into the sparse coding paradigm over a riemannian manifold via embedding them into rkhs .",
    "it is significantly different from the work in @xcite@xcite as the latter did not consider the riemannian geometry structure within data .",
    "2 .   to efficiently measure the neighborhood between data points on riemannian manifold , we compare the two geodesic distance under stein metric and log - euclidean metric , respectively . to our best knowledge",
    ", this is one of the first attempts , from the weighted structured perspective , to compare the benefit from this two metrics for analyzing spd matrices .",
    "we apply our proposed methods to several classification tasks where the data are depicted as region covariance matrices .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectionii ] , we give a brief review on the related works .",
    "section [ sectioniii ] is dedicated to introducing our novel neighborhood preserved kernel src , termed as npksrc .",
    "section [ sectioniv ] presents experimental results on image classification tasks .",
    "finally , section [ sectionv ] concludes our paper and also provides the directions for future improvements .",
    "before we introduce our model , in this section , we briefly review the recent development of sparse representation based classification methods@xcite@xcite and the analysis of riemannian geometry of spd manifold@xcite . for convenience , table [ notation ] gives the notation used throughout this paper .",

    "in this paper , a novel robust classification algorithm , termed as neighborhood preserved sparse representation , is proposed for spd matrices by fully exploiting the riemannian geometry structure within data .",
    "specifically , the local consistency constraint , formulated by the geodesic distance under log - euclidean metric , is imposed onto the sparse coding paradigm over a riemannian manifold .",
    "experimental results show that the proposed method can provide better classification solutions than the state - of - the - art approaches thanks to incorporating riemannian geometry structure .",
    "although our proposed method achieved promising performance in terms of recognition rate , there still exists some open issues deserving to study .",
    "one prompt direction may be how to devise a better weighted constraint such that the beneficial discriminant representations can be achieved .",
