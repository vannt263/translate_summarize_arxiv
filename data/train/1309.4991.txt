    "the starting point for the theory proposed here is simple but somewhat abstract .  instead of the five equations and five unknowns that the navier - stokes - fourier formulation employs to describe a single - component fluid in three spatial dimensions , this formulation requires six ( although the number of equations / unknowns drops back down to five for the linearized problem ) .",
    "the extra equation governs a new quantity , which i call the mechanical mass density and label as @xmath0 .",
    "it is a book - keeping variable to be used when defining inertial quantities such as linear and angular momentum and kinetic energy .",
    "the mechanical mass density is assumed to satisfy a continuity equation with nothing but convection to move it , while the ( actual ) mass density @xmath1 is governed by a balance law that includes a mass diffusion term in addition to a convection term .    behind the equations of motion that follow ,",
    "a philosophy has been adopted  to keep thermodynamics and mechanics separate in some key respects .  the non - convective mass flux , @xmath2 , is treated as one would the non - convective heat or internal energy flux , not , in other words , as a momentum involving a diffusion velocity .",
    "it is assumed to be dissipative and , consequently , its form is chosen based on non - equilibrium thermodynamic principles .",
    "on the other hand , the mechanical mass density may be viewed as the background mass density the material would have if it were somehow in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium with only the velocity field directly affecting it through the laws of continuum mechanics .",
    "the balance laws stemming from these ideas are proposed in  [ secbl ] .  in them , there appears a local continuum mechanical velocity , @xmath3 , which is used in the convection terms and in the definitions of the momentum and kinetic energy densities .",
    "also , in these inertial density definitions , the mechanical mass density is employed instead of the actual mass density .  finally , when postulating a form for the total pressure tensor appearing in the momentum equation , there is no allowance for mass diffusion effects , nor are mass diffusion and external body forces allowed to affect one another directly .",
    "the above statements warrant clarification :  i am not claiming there to be an absence of inertial effects arising from the mass diffusion .  after all , one may define momentum and kinetic energy densities involving the actual mass density or the total mass flux and then postulate balance laws for the time rate of change of those quantities .",
    "i prefer not to work with these , however , as their balance laws are complicated by cross - effects .  within my formulation ,",
    "the velocity @xmath3  is not responsible for the overall mass flow .  instead",
    ", it is seen to govern , through convection , only the mechanical part of the flow , e.g. that which is caused by pressure disturbances , moving boundaries , gravity , etc . , whereas the diffusional part of the mass flow is handled separately in accordance with non - equilibrium thermodynamics .  with this in mind ,",
    "the balance laws given in  [ secbl ]  for the linear momentum , angular momentum , and kinetic energy densities are understood to be laws for the _ mechanical part _ of the linear momentum , angular momentum , and kinetic energy densities .",
    "there are some interesting benefits to this approach .",
    "( 1 )  it circumvents the angular momentum conservation issues and other concerns raised in ttinger et al .",
    "@xcite , ( 2 ) because the diffusional part of the mass flux can be made to cancel with the convective part , it allows us to model an impermeable boundary with a non - zero normal velocity at that boundary  see  [ soundbc]as arising in the case of non - infinite acoustic impedance at a sound barrier ",
    "see morse and ingard @xcite , and ( 3 ) after appropriate constitutive equations and transport coefficients are chosen , it leads to the case of pure diffusion via fick s law when mass density gradients are present yet conditions have been chosen to eliminate all mechanical forces  see  [ diffusion ] .    in  [ secce ] and appendix [ applc ] ,",
    "the principles of irreversible thermodynamics are used to select general forms for the dissipative fluxes appearing in the balance laws .",
    "the navier - stokes - fourier formulation possesses two dissipative fluxes , the heat flux and the viscous pressure tensor , whereas mine at the outset possesses four : the aforementioned two , plus a non - convective mass flux and an energy flux due to chemical work .",
    "expressions for the chemical energy and heat fluxes are chosen in strict analogy to the first law of equilibrium thermodynamics .  with standard techniques ,",
    "my formulation produces linear constitutive laws that are expanded in terms of the usual affinities involving gradients of the velocity and temperature , as in the case of the navier - stokes - fourier formulation .",
    "however , there arise additional terms involving gradients of the chemical potential .",
    "since the non - convective internal energy flux may be expressed as the sum of those due to heat and chemical work , my formulation is found to have three independent constitutive laws and six transport coefficients ( two for each law ) , five of which are independent if onsager reciprocity is enforced .",
    "it may be difficult , if not impossible , to devise experiments for measuring each of my general transport coefficients individually .",
    "therefore , the proposed framework would not be very convenient or useful without a transport model to guide specific choices for the formulas of these transport coefficients .",
    "many thermodynamics textbooks , e.g. reif ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.12 ) , present a simple particle diffusion model as an introduction to non - equilibrium transport processes , the general idea being that the particles of a gas diffuse via random collisions with one another , and they carry with them extensive quantities , such as momentum and energy , which are exchanged during the collisions .",
    "these types of models , constructed for a classical monatomic ideal gas , are found to be qualitatively useful but quantitatively inaccurate , and thus they are immediately discarded for more complicated procedures based on the boltzmann equation .  however , within the setting of my general formulation , it is of interest to revisit these ideas of particle diffusion .",
    "i claim that my construction makes such an elementary picture a viable way of describing non - equilibrium transport in fluids .",
    "moreover , the ideas behind this model are not constrained to the very restrictive case of a classical monatomic ideal gas .  in  [ sectc ]",
    ", a transport model is proposed in which diffusing groups of particles have random encounters with other groups , whereby they exchange not only momentum and energy , but also mass .",
    "this gives rise to formulas for all six transport coefficients involving just one diffusion parameter , @xmath4 .",
    ", there is a little bit of flexibility regarding this issue as discussed in appendix [ tmd ] . ]  furthermore , onsager reciprocity and the second law of thermodynamics are both automatically satisfied , the latter requiring only that the fluid have intrinsic equilibrium thermodynamic stability and @xmath5 .",
    "the heat flux law arising from such a model turns out to be different from fourier s , and the diffusion transport assumption results in a new form for the viscous pressure , as well .  of course",
    ", it is important to be able relate @xmath4 to the typical transport parameters , the bulk and shear viscosities and heat conductivity , in problems for which the navier - stokes - fourier formulation is known to give the right answer .",
    "this is easily done by using sound attenuation data , for example , as shown in  [ sound ] .",
    "an equally important issue is that there must be a way of experimentally distinguishing between the two theories for a problem where the navier - stokes - fourier equations can be shown to fail .  light scattering , addressed in  [ ls ] ,  may prove to be such an experiment , and it is currently being conducted .    when considering the dimensionless knudsen number , @xmath6 , defined as",
    "the ratio of the fluid s mean free path length to some characteristic length scale in a particular problem , it should be emphasized that , like navier - stokes - fourier , mine is a formulation intended to be used in the hydrodynamic , or small @xmath6 , regime .",
    "i do not make any general claims that my continuum formulation works well into the more rarefied gas regime , although experimental data for sound propagation in the noble gases shows that mine performs significantly better than navier - stokes - fourier there  see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the previously mentioned light scattering experiment is being designed to study gases fully in the hydrodynamic regime which , up until now , has either been ignored or not adequately resolved in all other such experiments .",
    "sound propagation , light scattering , and several other problems are explored in  [ secprobs ] .  as a general rule ,",
    "one finds that the formulas derived from my equations tend to be , in many ways , much simpler and easier to interpret than those obtained from the navier - stokes - fourier theory .",
    "in fact for some problems , when only approximate answers may be computed with the navier - stokes - fourier equations , exact solutions result from my theory .",
    "another convenience is that , as demonstrated in appendix [ difp ] , it is quite easy to obtain values for the diffusion parameter @xmath4 , especially when compared to the task of measuring the three transport parameters required for the navier - stokes - fourier formulation .",
    "despite these appealing features , there are two aspects of my formulation that may appear troubling .",
    "( 1 ) the mechanical mass density is not a directly measurable quantity , and  ( 2 ) my formulation is incompatible with the kinetic theory of gases .  regarding the first item ,",
    "it should be observed that there are many instances of well - accepted macroscopic theories that involve computationally useful , but not directly measurable , quantities .",
    "the admitted difference here is that one is accustomed to conceiving of the mass density as an absolute concept with no ambiguity built into its definition and , therefore , seeming to present no need for alternate definitions .",
    "it is typical for more licence to be granted when defining new velocities and energies , for example .",
    "although the mechanical mass density is an abstract concept , my theory uses it not in place of  but rather in conjunction with  the actual mass density , which is a quantity that is measurable and tied , in an averaged sense , to the masses of the molecules comprising the fluid .",
    "the second of the concerns mentioned above carries more significance .",
    "the incompatibility is evident from the fact that the navier - stokes - fourier equations may be derived from the boltzmann equation via the chapman - enskog procedure for the special case of a classical monatomic ideal gas ( see huang ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.6 ) , for example ) .  with this procedure ,",
    "the navier - stokes - fourier formulation is the first - order approximation in the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it must be emphasized that the difference between navier - stokes - fourier and my theory is _ not _ a higher - order @xmath6  effect .",
    "therefore , mine may not be developed from the burnett equations or grad s moment method , for example .",
    "the connection between navier - stokes - fourier and kinetic gas theory is generally interpreted to mean that both are correct , but perhaps both are missing the same concept .",
    "i realize that without proof , this seems like a heretical claim .",
    "however , if the results of the aforementioned light scattering experiment support my theory , then this would necessitate a reconception of kinetic gas theory in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "i have not been alone in my efforts to include an extra diffusive mechanism as part of the fluid equations of motion .  for early examples ,",
    "see slezkin @xcite , @xcite and vallander @xcite , and for later examples , see klimontovich @xcite , @xcite , brenner @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and dadzie et al .",
    "my formulation proves to be significantly different from each of these treatments .",
    "to facilitate the subsequent development , let us first mention a few notational items .",
    "the number of lines under a symbol indicates its tensor order :  a scalar ( zeroth - order tensor ) has no underlines ( e.g. temperature , @xmath7 ) , a first - order tensor has one underline ( e.g. velocity , @xmath3 ) , a second - order tensor has two underlines ( e.g. pressure tensor , @xmath8 ) , etc .",
    "a tensor of arbitrary order is indicated in bold .",
    "the symbol @xmath9 is used to represent the second - order identity tensor and @xmath10  and @xmath11  to denote the zero vector and zero second - order tensor , respectively .",
    "all of the tensor operators used in this paper are defined in appendix [ appto ] .",

    "notice that only one transport parameter @xmath4 appears .  is not the self - diffusion coefficient , although these quantities are the same order of magnitude for gases ( see appendix [ difp ] ) . ]",

    "therefore , for convenience , let us define a dimensionless coefficient @xmath125  ( possibly a function of thermodynamic variables ) via@xmath126 in order to match greenspan s @xcite sound attenuation data in the hydrodynamic regime for classical monatomic ideal gases at room temperature , for example , we take @xmath127 .",

    "i hope to have motivated the proposed formulation by the simple transport mechanism underlying its constitutive equations , one that is easily generalized to model more complicated problems such as multicomponent fluid mixtures ( see appendix [ appmc ] ) .",
    "of course , its utility nonetheless hinges on the answers to two important questions :  ( 1 ) how adequately does this formulation perform in problems of fluid mechanics , and ( 2 ) are its predictions in the hydrodynamic regime quantifiably different from those found with the navier - stokes - fourier formulation ?",
    "next , let us briefly highlight some of the results that have been obtained so far .",
    "in all of the following sections but  [ shock ] , problems that may be examined with low mach number linearizations are considered .",
    ", to be the ratio of the characteristic speed in a particular problem to the fluid s sound speed , the low mach number regime is taken to be that in which @xmath134 .",
    "]  a one - dimensional linear stability analysis is carried out in  [ stability ] to show that my formulation is unconditionally stable provided that the diffusion parameter , @xmath4 , is positive .  in  [ diffusion ] , a mass equilibration problem with no mechanical forces is studied in order to show that my formulation reduces to one of pure diffusion governed by fick s law .",
    "next , low amplitude sound propagation , which is the subject of  [ sound ] , is demonstrated to be a way of relating my diffusion parameter , @xmath4 ,  to the transport parameters of the navier - stokes - fourier formulation by matching attenuations in the hydrodynamic ( small @xmath6 ) regime , thereby connecting the two theories in this sense .",
    "obviously , therefore , sound is not a good way to distinguish between my theory and navier - stokes - fourier .",
    "however , in  [ ls ] , light scattering is shown to provide a way of testing the difference .  the shifted brillouin peaks , which correspond to the sound ( phonon ) part of the spectrum , are virtually indistinguishable , as one would expect , but the central rayleigh peak predictions are significantly different .  for example , in a classical monatomic ideal gas in the hydrodynamic regime , my theory predicts a rayleigh peak that is about @xmath135 taller and narrower than the navier - stokes - fourier theory ( but with the same area so that the well - verified landau - placzek ratio remains intact ) .",
    "previous experimenters , e.g. clark @xcite and fookson et al .",
    "@xcite , did not study gases fully in the hydrodynamic regime , @xmath136 , choosing instead to focus on more rarefied gases with knudsen numbers in the range , @xmath137 ,  which extends into the slip flow and transition regimes .",
    "therefore , in order to verify my theory , it is important to conduct a high - resolution light scattering experiment for a gas in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "another striking difference in predictions arises from the non - linear steady - state shock wave problem considered in ",
    "[ shock ] .",
    "it is well - known that for this problem , the navier - stokes - fourier formulation  and all other accepted theories , for that matter",
    " produces normalized density , velocity , and temperature shock wave profiles that are appreciably displaced from one another with the temperature profile in the leading edge of the shock , velocity behind it , and density trailing in the back .",
    "my formulation , however , predicts virtually no displacement between these three profiles in the leading edge of the shock and much less pronounced displacements in the middle and trailing end of the shock .",
    "if an experiment can be devised to measure both the structure and position of the steady shock profiles of the mass density and , say , the temperature , then this would be another decisive test between my theory and all others .",
    "thermophoresis , or the down - temperature - gradient motion of a macroscopic particle in a resting fluid , is discussed in  [ therm ] .  for an idealized problem",
    ", it is shown that , through the steady - state balancing of the mechanical and diffusive terms of the mass flow , my theory provides a mechanism for thermophoresis that is not present in the navier - stokes - fourier formulation .  in the latter type",
    ", a thermal slip boundary condition at the particle s surface is needed in order to model thermophoretic motion , whereas the former type may be used to describe this motion with a no - slip boundary condition , i.e. one in which the tangential velocity of the particle at its surface equals that of the fluid .",
    "the concept of thermal slip is based on kinetic gas theory arguments in the slip flow regime , appropriate for @xmath138 , yet thermophoresis is observed in gases for much smaller knudsen numbers in the hydrodynamic regime and also in liquids .  therefore , there are obvious advantages to being able to model this problem without the thermal slip condition .",
    "another example in which we cancel the diffusional and convective parts of the mass flux at an impermeable boundary is considered in  [ soundbc ] .  here",
    ", we discuss acoustic impedance at a sound barrier , as presented in morse and ingard @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is demonstrated that my formulation allows an impermeable boundary with a non - zero normal velocity at that boundary as that which occurs in the case of non - infinite impedance .",
    "there is one topic that remains to be introduced .  as a step towards bridging the gap between microscopic and macroscopic scales in my theory ,",
    "the subject of fluctuating hydrodynamics is addressed in  [ flh ] , where it is shown that the thermodynamic interpretation of a continuum mechanical point ( i.e. a point occupied by matter and moving with velocity @xmath3 ) stemming from my formulation is fundamentally different from that of navier - stokes - fourier .  that is , in the navier - stokes - fourier theory , a continuum mechanical point is viewed as a thermodynamic subsystem in contact with its surrounding material which acts as a heat reservoir ; whereas in my theory , the surrounding material acts not only as a heat  but also a particle  reservoir .",
    "although i did not explicitly demonstrate it in this paper , the correlation formulas in  [ flh ] may be used to derive the light scattering spectra which follow in  [ ls ] .",
    "let us consider the cartesian one - dimensional problem in which variation is assumed to be in the @xmath139-direction only with @xmath140  as the only non - zero component of the velocity and there are assumed to be no body forces .",
    "if we use the helmholtz free energy formalism to recast the @xmath62-formulation ( [ smf1 ] ) with diffusion transport constitutive equations ( [ tc19])-([tc21 ] ) in terms of the variables , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath140 , and @xmath7 , and then linearize about the constant equilibrium state,@xmath141 via the expansions,@xmath142 where @xmath143  is a small dimensionless parameter proportional to the mach number , then we arrive at the following system of linear equations:@xmath144 where the subscript `` @xmath145 '' indicates that the parameter is evaluated at the constant equilibrium state ( [ c1 ] ) .  note that for this linearized problem , the mechanical mass equation ( [ c6 ] ) may be uncoupled from the rest of the system , ( [ c7])-([c9 ] ) .  postulating a solution,@xmath146{c}m_{1}\\\\ v_{x,1}\\\\ t_{1}\\end{array }",

    "the thermal roots ( [ c26 ] ) arise only when the temperature equation ( [ c109 ] ) is coupled back into the system .",
    "this means that within my formulation , thermal modes of the solution may contribute only to the temperature variable and not the pressure or velocity variables , i.e. the mechanical variables .  on the other hand",
    ", propagational and extra modes may contribute to all three .",
    "next , let us examine the length scales associated with each of these three types of roots .",
    "if we compute the length scale as the distance it takes for a mode to attenuate to @xmath237 of its amplitude , then we find the propagational , thermal , and extra mode lengths to be@xmath238@xmath239 and@xmath240 respectively , where ( [ c25])-([c27 ] ) and ( [ c28.5 ] ) have been used in the above .",

    "the extra mode has a length scale @xmath252 roughly equal to the mean free path length of the gas in its equilibrium state @xmath234 , regardless of sound frequency , and@xmath253 away from boundaries , the propagational modes of sound waves dominate .",
    "however , depending on the boundary conditions , the thermal and extra modes may play an important role near walls , causing the formation of boundary layers with lengths @xmath254  and @xmath252 , respectively .",
    "when the navier - stokes - fourier equations are recast in the gibbs free energy description and linearized as above , we arrive at the following system:@xmath255 which again yields dispersion relation ( [ c29 ] ) and the four roots ( [ c30 ] ) and ( [ c31 ] ) .  unlike in my formulation , none of the above equations uncouple from one another .",
    "therefore , in the navier - stokes - fourier formulation the two possible modes , propagational and thermal , may contribute to each of the three variables : pressure , velocity , and temperature .",
