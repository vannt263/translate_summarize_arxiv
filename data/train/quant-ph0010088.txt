    "the concept of spin is a fascinating topic in quantum theory . defined through the commutation relations ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 which are common to intrinsic spin @xmath2 as well as orbital angular momentum @xmath3 ,",
    "it is interesting to note that equation ( [ com ] ) , in the case of @xmath4 can be derived from the position - momentum commutation relations @xmath5=i\\ , \\quad \\,k = x , y , z.\\ ] ] on the other hand , intrinsic spin associated with point particles like electrons are described in terms of the ` up ' spinor , @xmath6 and the ` down ' spinor , @xmath7 which are well - defined mathematically once the definition ( [ com ] ) for spin is accepted .",
    "considering , therefore , the spinors as fundamental entities , schwinger @xcite visualized any state @xmath8 as made up of @xmath9 ` up ' spinors and @xmath10 ` down ' spinors through @xmath11}^{1\\over 2}}|00\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the creation operators for the spin ` up ' and spin ` down ' states , respectively .",
    "according to biedenharn and louck @xcite , this work of schwinger was motivated by the celebrated paper of majorana @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the fundamental uncertainty relation @xmath13 of heisenberg , which is equally valid for any pair of canonically conjugate variables , follows once ( [ pm ] ) is postulated . like wise , the uncertainty relations @xmath14 for the spin operator @xmath15 , with @xmath16 cyclically , are derivable for any spin state @xmath17 once ( [ com ] ) is postulated , although no two components of @xmath15 are canonically conjugate to each other .",
    "it is also well - known that @xmath18 in the case of the ground state of a simple harmonic oscillator in one dimension and this corresponds to the minimum uncertainty given by the equality in ( [ unc ] ) .",
    "a state for which @xmath19 is then said to be squeezed in configuration space .",
    "one can similarly define a squeezed state of the oscillator in momentum space . just as the idea of coherent states introduced by schroedinger @xcite for the harmonic oscillator was extended @xcite to discuss coherence in optics , the notion of squeezed states was also extended to the radiation field @xcite and to spin states @xcite as well .",
    "a spin state may be said @xcite to be squeezed if the variance @xmath20 associated with a spin component normal to the mean spin direction @xmath21 satisfies the condition , @xmath22 a more stringent condition @xmath23^{1\\over 2}<1,\\ ] ] has been advocated by wineland et al @xcite .",
    "kitagawa and ueda @xcite have argued that it would be possible to cancel out fluctuations in one direction normal to @xmath21 at the expense of the other , provided quantum correlations are established among the elementary spinors which constitute a spin @xmath24 state in the sense of ( [ sch ] ) . likewise a physical basis for ( [ xi ] ) has also been discussed by puri @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , a classification of pure states @xmath17 into two classes referred to as ` oriented ' and ` non - oriented ' has been suggested employing a construction of states of spin @xmath24 out of @xmath25 non - collinear spinors and it was explicitly shown in the case of @xmath26 that a state @xmath17 has to be necessarily non - oriented for it to be a squeezed state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the notion of spin squeezing to statistical assemblies of particles with spin @xmath24 as it will not only provide a complete spin description of spin squeezing but also facilitate planning of experiments to study squeezed spin states .",
    "this discussion is best done naturally by employing the language of the density matrix .",
    "an advantage of the density matrix formalism is that it can be applied with equal ease to discuss pure as well as the mixed spin systems .",
    "this formalism is outlined in section 2 using the well known spherical tensor representation for the density matrix . in section 3 the squeezing condition ( [ sc ] ) based on the uncertainty relation ( [ us ] ) is generalized to take care of statistical assemblies as well . in section 4 , we show that squeezing is exhibited by only non - oriented systems with non - zero vector polarization . in section 5 we discuss the squeezing behaviour of a mixed spin 1 state which naturally arises in experiments @xcite employing polarized spin @xmath27 beams on polarized spin @xmath28 targets .",
    "we also look into the spin - spin correlations which exist between these spinors when they are combined to yield a spin @xmath29 state .",
    "the density matrix @xmath30 for a spin @xmath24 system , pure or mixed has the standard expansion @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 , the identity operator ) are irreducible tensor operators of rank @xmath34 in the @xmath35 dimensional spin space with projection @xmath36 along the axis of quantization in the real 3-dimensional space .",
    "the @xmath32 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath37=[s][k_{1}][k_{2}]\\sum^{k_{1}+k_{2}}_{k=\\vert k_{1}-k_{2 } \\vert } \\left(1-(-1)^ { k_{1}+k_{2}-k}\\right)\\ c(k_{1}k_{2}k;q_{1}q_{2}q)\\nonumber\\\\   \\lo \\times w(sk_{1}sk_{2};sk)\\ \\tau^{k}_{q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote clebsch - gordan and racah coefficients respectively and we use the short hand @xmath40=\\sqrt{2 s+1}$ ] .",
    "they also satisfy the orthogonality relations @xmath41 here the normalization has been chosen so as to be in agreement with madison convention @xcite .",
    "the fano statistical tensors or the spherical tensor parameters @xmath42 in ( [ rho ] ) which characterize the given system are the average expectation values given by @xmath43 since @xmath30 is hermitian , and @xmath44 , these satisfy the condition @xmath45 apart from @xmath46 , there are @xmath47 real independent parameters for the most general mixed state .",
    "the density matrix @xmath30 for pure state satisfies @xmath48 , and hence a normalized pure state has only @xmath49 real independent parameters describing it .",
    "this leads to a set of constraints @xmath50\\sum _ { k_{1},k_{2 } } [ k_{1}][k_{2}]\\ w(sk_{1 } sk_{2};sk)\\ ( t^{k_{1 } } \\otimes t^{k_{2}})^{k}_{q}=[s]\\ t^{k}_{q}\\ ] ] on @xmath42 for each @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is worth noting here that in addition to the above representation for density matrix which uses spherical tensor operators , there also exist other representations such as the @xmath51 representation @xcite , where the density matrix is expanded in terms of the generators of the lie group @xmath51 , whose number is also @xmath52 .",
    "this representation is advantageous since the diagonal form of @xmath30 can be expressed in terms of the subset consisting of diagonal generators which are @xmath53 in number . on the other hand ,",
    "the spherical tensor representation which is widely used in spin physics has the advantage that the spherical tensor parameters have simple transformation properties under coordinate rotations in the real 3-dimensional space .",
    "if a coordinate frame i is transformed to ii through a rotation @xmath54,where @xmath55 are the eulerian angles , the @xmath42 in the respective frames are related through @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the matrix representation of the rotation .",
    "the spherical tensor operators @xmath58 are homogeneous polynomials of rank @xmath34 and projection @xmath36 , constructed out of the spin operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "a partially polarized or completely polarized state is said to be vector polarized if @xmath79 and aligned or tensor polarized if at least one @xmath80 . a cartesian coordinate frame chosen with its @xmath81axis parallel to @xmath82",
    "is referred to as lakin frame [ lf ] @xcite . in other words , in such a frame @xmath83 . on the other hand , a frame in which @xmath84 is real and @xmath85",
    "is referred to as the principal axes of alignment frame ( paaf ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is also identified as a frame in which the traceless second rank cartesian tensor @xmath86 ( which is defined by the @xmath42 ) is diagonal .",
    "while there is only one paaf for a system up to possible renaming of the axes , lakin frame on the other hand requires only @xmath87 axis to be along @xmath88 and depending on the choice of @xmath89 and @xmath90 axes , we have an infinite number of lfs .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relationship for the spin operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 satisfying ( [ com ] ) is given by ( [ us ] ) , where the variance @xmath91 and the average expectation value @xmath92 depend not only on the spin state but also on the frame with respect to which the spin operators have been specified .",
    "following kitagawa and ueda @xcite and puri @xcite , we have defined squeezing criterion in our earlier paper @xcite as follows . given the quantum state @xmath93 of spin @xmath24 , the mean spin direction associated with it is given by @xmath94 the state @xmath93 is then said to be squeezed in the spin component @xmath95 , if @xmath96 where @xmath97 is orthogonal to @xmath88 .",
    "this criterion of squeezing aims at characterizing squeezing as an intrinsic feature of the state and kitagawa and ueda @xcite have remarked that if the spin state is visualized as being made up of @xmath25 spin @xmath98 states , then the quantum correlations that exist among these component spins are responsible for the manifestation of squeezing in the given quantum state .",
    "they substantiate their statement through a pictorial representation in which they show that a spin coherent state which is built out of @xmath25 spinors all oriented in the same direction , is not squeezed as there exist no quantum correlations in such an arrangement . on the other hand , a squeezed state of spin",
    "is depicted as being built out of the same number of the spins which possess quantum correlation .",
    "we have looked into this aspect , in all its details , in the case of spin 1 in our earlier paper @xcite and an explicit connection between the spin - spin correlations and spin squeezing has been shown to exist . in the light of this we now adopt for the case of mixed states the generalized form of the above criterion . explicitly , a spin state specified by @xmath30 is said to be squeezed in the component @xmath99 , if @xmath100 where @xmath97 denotes any direction which is orthogonal to the vector polarization @xmath82 .",
    "it may be noted here that the squeezing criterion defined here is distinct from several others used in the literature @xcite .",
    "for example , if one uses the criterion @xmath101 where the components are referred to a frame chosen arbitrarily then , as has been pointed out by kitagawa and ueda @xcite , it turns out that a given state will be squeezed with respect to a component in one frame but will not be so in another frame .",
    "this aspect makes squeezing solely frame - dependent and extrinsic to the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the above form ( [ sq ] ) of the criterion suggests that a quantum state itself specifies a direction with respect to which it reveals the presence of squeezing in its spin component . as such ,",
    "this criterion , which we adopt here , characterizes any manifestation of squeezing as an intrinsic property of a spin system , like in the case of radiation field .",
    "we now classify , as in our earlier paper , the spin states into oriented and non - oriented states and study the squeezing aspect of states in each class based on this criterion ( [ sq ] ) .",
    "a spin system is said to be oriented @xcite if its density matrix @xmath30 has a diagonal form @xmath102 with its eigen states being the angular momentum basis states @xmath103 referred to the axis of quantization @xmath87 . in other words , an oriented system is one in which the populations are distributed with respect to the basis states @xmath104 and @xmath105 is then called the axis of orientation .",
    "it may be noted here that this definition for mixed states is a natural generalization of the definition of an oriented pure state defined in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "if @xmath106 denote the fractional populations of an oriented system in the states @xmath104 , the density matrix @xmath107 is given by the expansion @xmath108 the vector polarization @xmath82 , for such a system turns out to be along @xmath87 itself and in a lf whose @xmath81axis is along @xmath87 , we have @xmath109 any vector @xmath97 perpendicular to @xmath88 , therefore lies in the @xmath110-plane of the chosen lf and we can express it as @xmath111 this makes @xmath112 and we have @xmath113 since @xmath114 in the lakin frame .",
    "the variance in @xmath115 then becomes @xmath116,\\ ] ] so that the squeezing criterion ( [ sq ] ) for an oriented system takes the form @xmath117 and it is quite easy to see that this inequality is never satisfied for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that no oriented system , either pure or mixed , is squeezed .",
    "it is interesting to note here that every spin @xmath98 state , either pure or mixed , is always oriented .",
    "this is due to the property that any spin @xmath98 density matrix can always be diagonalized by an appropriate unitary matrix belonging to the group @xmath118 , the latter bearing the property that it provides a representation of the rotation group in 3-dimension . in other words",
    "the eigen states of the density matrix @xmath30 for a spin @xmath98 system can always be identified as the spin -up and spin down states with respect to an appropriate axis of quantization .",
    "this , together with what has been said above , implies that squeezing is absent in the case of spin @xmath98 , irrespective of whether the state is pure or mixed .",
    "we now look at the second class of spin states namely the _ non - oriented _ spin systems and look at their squeezing behaviour in what follows .      a non - oriented spin @xmath24 state @xmath93 has been defined earlier @xcite as one which can not be identified as eigen state of @xmath60 with any choice of @xmath81axis as the axis of quantization .",
    "we may therefore define a mixed non - oriented system as one where the eigen states @xmath119 of the density matrix @xmath30 can not all be identified with states @xmath120 with respect to any suitable @xmath81axis . in other words , at least one of the eigen states @xmath121 has to be non - oriented as defined earlier",
    ". the system will be maximally non - oriented if every one of the eigen states is non - oriented .",
    "such non - oriented systems can exist only for spin @xmath122 since the unitary group in @xmath123-dimension is homomorphic to the rotation group in 3-dimensions only in the particular case of @xmath124 .",
    "while an oriented system gets specified through the distribution of populations in angular momentum states with respect to a single axis namely the axis of orientation , it has been shown by ramachandran and ravishankar @xcite that a non - oriented system is characterised by more than one axis .",
    "this identification has been arrived at using the spherical tensor representation for the density matrix of such a system . in the most general case",
    "it has been shown by them that a set of @xmath125 axes @xmath126 are needed to characterize a non - oriented state .",
    "each @xmath42 in ( [ rho ] ) for any given @xmath30 can be expressed as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a real constant and @xmath129 is the spherical harmonic function associated with the direction @xmath130 .",
    "an oriented system , in this language , is one for which all the @xmath125 axes merge together to give a single axis @xmath131 , which is itself the axis of orientation .",
    "the choice of @xmath81axis along @xmath131 for an oriented system leads to the vanishing of all @xmath42 with @xmath132 and therefore , an oriented system in its lf is described by the fano statistical tensors @xmath133 only . the non - oriented systems , on the other hand , possess , in general , non - zero @xmath42 with respect to any angular momentum basis .",
    "before we look into the aspect of squeezing , it may be appropriate to briefly mention the nomenclature for the specific kinds of spin systems , often adopted in the spin physics literature .",
    "a spin system with non - zero @xmath66 is said to be vector polarized while that with non - zero @xmath69 is said to be aligned .",
    "a purely aligned system has non - zero @xmath69 but all other tensor polarizations including the vector polarization @xmath66 will be zero .",
    "coming back to the notion of squeezing , it is to be noted that for the squeezing criterion to be satisfied , the system should necessarily possess non - zero vector polarization since only then the right hand side of the inequality in ( [ sq ] ) will be non - zero and one can look for the satisfiability of the squeezing criterion .",
    "if the vector polarization is zero then every frame qualifies to be a lakin frame and since @xmath134 is always non - negative for any direction @xmath135 , we conclude that all non - oriented states which do not possess vector polarization lack squeezing .",
    "one can , however , define higher order squeezing behaviour via a proper criterion and examine such situations .",
    "having ruled out squeezing in the case of oriented systems and in the case of non - oriented systems with zero vector polarization , we are left with non - oriented systems which possess non - zero vector polarization .",
    "let us suppose that the density matrix of such a system is specified with respect to the angular momentum basis @xmath136 relative to a frame @xmath137 in terms of the spherical tensors @xmath42 through ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "we now make a transition to a particular lf @xmath138 in the following way .",
    "the vector polarization direction @xmath139 of the system is determined by using ( [ p ] ) .",
    "if @xmath140 denote the direction of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath137 , the frame @xmath137 is rotated first about the @xmath81axis through @xmath141 and then about the new @xmath142axis through @xmath143 .",
    "the frame so obtained ( call it @xmath144 ) is a lakin frame as the @xmath81axis of @xmath137 now coincides with @xmath87 .",
    "the spherical tensor parameters @xmath42 that specify the density matrix @xmath30 in this frame are related to @xmath145 through @xmath146 while this frame is enough for the purpose of identifying squeezing , we wish to use the additional degree of freedom of rotating @xmath144 about @xmath87 through an angle @xmath147 to get a special lf .",
    "the angle @xmath147 here is so chosen that the second rank tensor @xmath84 after the rotation is real . with this choice of @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the first being due to transition to a lf while the second being due to the use of additional degree of freedom of rotation about @xmath87 through @xmath151 . in the special lf @xmath148 , we then collect the relevant quantities needed for identifying squeezing given by @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 defining @xmath155 as in equation ( [ sper ] ) we get @xmath156 so that the squeezing criterion for @xmath155 takes the form @xmath157^{1\\over 2}\\left(2 t ^{2}_{2}\\cos 2\\phi - { \\textstyle{\\sqrt { 2\\over 3}}}t^{2}_{0}\\right )",

    "this inequality is indeed satisfied over a range of values for @xmath42 and we therefore conclude that squeezing is indeed exhibited by only non - orenited states with non - zero vector polarization . to support the claim made here we present below in table ( 1 ) several situations which reveal the presence of squeezing .",
    "we wish to note here that @xmath42 present in the table above actually correspond to realistic situations as they have been chosen in accordance with the positive semi - definiteness requirement of the density matrix @xmath30 .",
    "for example , for @xmath26 , this property of @xmath30 implies that the spherical tensor parameters have to satisfy the boundary conditions @xcite @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 if all the @xmath42s are treated as the component of a @xmath163 dimensional complex vector @xmath164 , then , when the spin system is subjected to an interaction , this vector @xmath164 starts moving in the @xmath165 dimensional complex space , of course , subjected to the above constraints .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how the squeezing evolves during such an evolution . this behaviour merits an independent study which is being taken up at present .",
    "the concept of channel spin plays an important role in hadron scattering and reaction processes .",
    "consider for example , a beam of nucleons colliding with a proton target both of which are prepared initially to be mixed states specified by their density matrices @xmath166= { 1 \\over 2 }   \\sum_{k , q } t^{k}_{q}(i)\\tau^{k^{\\dagger}}_{q}(i)\\   ; \\",

    "a glance at the above equation for @xmath66 suggests that the @xmath177axis ( of the lf ) should be chosen along @xmath178 .",

    "the graphical study also reveals that squeezing appears only when the degree of polarization of both the spins are more than 77% of that for a pure state in each case",
    ". in particular , when the states are pure , the combined system will also be in a pure state but the spin 1 projection of this pure state will be in an entangled state ( refer to equation ( 25 ) in reference @xcite ) .    in this state , the squeezing condition reduces to @xmath200 which agrees with the result obtained in our earlier paper @xcite ( except that we have called the angle between @xmath194 and @xmath195 as @xmath201 here , while it is taken as @xmath199 there ) .",
    "the origin of the squeezing behaviour of the coupled spin 1 system can be traced as arising due to the intrinsic quantum correlations that exist between the individual spinors .",
    "these correlations can be classified as ( 1 ) those that arise due to the coupling of the two subsystems and ( 2 ) those that arise when the combined total density matrix @xmath202 is projected on to the desired spin space . in our present case",
    ", we have taken @xmath202 to be a direct product of the two subsystem density matrices @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "such a @xmath202 is not entangled and therefore there are no correlations of the first kind . however , when we take the spin 1 projection of @xmath202 , the correlations of the second type will appear in the spin 1 projection .",
    "these correlations are given by @xmath205 where @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "we have done a detailed graphical study of the correlations and squeezing for various values of the independent parameters . while the study reveals that squeezing and correlations coexist and are equally more pronounced in certain ranges , there are also narrow regions where one exists in the absence of the other .",
    "all these aspects are revealed in the figures 4 - 6 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study more general cases of coupling of the sub systems in order to identify definite relationship between correlations and squeezing . in the context of quantum computation ,",
    "the nature of coupled states has been studied @xcite under the following configurations : + ( 1 ) @xmath202 is strongly separable ; i.e. , @xmath209 + ( 2 ) @xmath202 is weakly separable ; i.e. , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 + ( 3 ) @xmath202 is non - separable ; i.e. , @xmath202 can not be expressed as in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the third configuration is indeed recognized as possessing quantum entanglement .",
