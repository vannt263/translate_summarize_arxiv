    "_ hst _ s high resolution has been particularly important in opening up these fields and framing the questions : how did large scale structure initially form ? what is the role of hierarchical mergers ? what is the role of the massive central black holes ( bhs ) which now appear to be found in most nearby galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) ?",
    "just as high - resolution optical and near - ir observations are essential to the study of galaxy formation and evolution , x - ray astronomy has been key to the study of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "we now commonly explain agn via accretion onto massive black holes , with the difference between type  1 and type  2 agn explained via an obscuring torus in the standard unified model ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",

    "- ray surveys have provided essential information on the evolution of agn and on the origin of the xrb .",
    "about 80% of the @xmath7  kev background was resolved into discrete sources by rosat ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) , and most of these sources were identified as agn ( schmidt et al .",
    "these agn are typically broad line qsos or type  1 seyferts , to be expected given rosat s sensitivity to soft x - rays and thus unobscured agn .",
    "the deep rosat surveys also sampled the low end of the luminosity function of agn at high-@xmath8 , discovering strong _ density _ evolution ( hasinger et al .  1999 , miyaji et al .",
    "this is thought to be a consequence of the larger rate of interactions and distorted / irregular morphologies at high-@xmath8 ( lilly et al .",

    "nonetheless , the physical nature of the relation between agn evolution and galaxy evolution is unknown .",
    "recent evidence for the existence of this relationship comes from the strong correlation observed between bh mass and host galaxy bulge velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "but the very basic question of whether nuclear activity drives galaxy evolution or vice versa is still open .",
    "answering these questions requires observing obscured and unobscured agn _ and _ their hosts , as a function of redshift . the combination of _ hst _ and chandra provides the potential to first detect agn via their x - ray emission , and then to study their optical host galaxies with _",
    "this permits studying the effect of environment on agn and their evolution , and perhaps the effect of the agn on their environments .",
    "the immediate questions are : 1 ) are tidal interactions and/or distorted morphologies more prevalent in agn hosts than in field galaxies ? 2 ) are host galaxy characteristics correlated with agn characteristics like flux and hardness ( i.e. , obscured vs.  non - obscured ) , and do these correlations change with @xmath8 ?",
    "3 ) can we confirm the unified model at high @xmath8 ?",
    "4 ) can we measure agn luminosity vs.  expected eddington luminosity as a function of @xmath8 ( by estimating bh masses via follow - up velocity dispersion measurements of host bulges ) ?    in this paper",

    "there is a readily apparent dichotomy in the color magnitude distribution of the optical counterparts of the x - ray sources : a brighter group with @xmath60 , and a fainter group with @xmath61 .",
    "the fainter group ( containing only five sources ) is consistent in its color distribution with the field galaxy population .",
    "the other group is both significantly brighter and significantly redder , on average , than the population of field sources .",
    "further , those optically bright x - ray sources that are extended in our _ hst _ images ( those indicated by squares and circles in figure  [ fig : col_mag ] ) appear redder than the rest of the bright sources .",
    "this subset of bright extended sources occupies a narrow range of color , @xmath62 , while spanning a magnitude range @xmath63 .",
    "there is also a suggestion that the chandra - detected late type galaxies are optically fainter than the corresponding early - type galaxies .",
    "the fact that the x - ray sources with resolved optical candidates appear to occupy two different regions of color - magnitude space strongly suggests that we are seeing two ( or more ) different populations of sources .",
    "we note that the faint limit ( @xmath64 ) of the brighter population is well above our completeness limit , and that the distributions of these sources in both magnitude and color are significantly different from the field population distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig : col_hists ] , we plot histograms of the number of sources vs. color for the x - ray source counterparts ( solid ) and the field sources ( dotted ) .",
    "the top set of histograms includes sources at all magnitudes , the bottom is limited to sources with @xmath65 .",
    "the redder color of the x - ray emitting galaxies is obvious , even when we limit the field sample to the brighter sources .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test rules out a common underlying color distribution at the @xmath66 level .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram also shows a far greater incidence of x - ray counterparts for the optically brighter sources than for the fainter sources  16 _ cxo _ detections among the 195 _ hst _ sources with @xmath67 , in contrast to 5 detections among the 2060 sources with @xmath68 .",
    "we suggest that the brighter population is spatially relatively sparse , since the sources are observed well above the optical detection limit .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray luminosities estimated from the available preliminary redshifts suggest that these are predominantly agn : 11 of 16 optically bright sources have x - ray luminosities @xmath69  erg  s@xmath70 , and 5 have luminosities in the range @xmath71  erg  s@xmath70 , likely type  2 agn and/or starburst galaxies .",
    "the fact that the agn are associated , on average , with redder galaxies could suggest the presence of dust associated with mergers in agn hosts .",
    "the x - ray emitting galaxies in the optically fainter group represent a small fraction of the field galaxies , but their colors , on the other hand , are near the average for the field population .",
    "their optical fluxes are not much above our detection limits , and we suggest that these could well represent the high x - ray intensity tip of a much larger population of sources .    in figure",

    "we also plot a type  1 agn track ( for a qso of @xmath73 ) , assuming the fluxes are dominated by the flat - spectrum nuclear component .",
    "for the x - ray counterparts , we use the same symbols as in figure  [ fig : col_mag ] to distinguish between ellipticals , spirals , unresolved and indeterminate optical classifications .",
    "we further code for the intensity and hardness ratio for the x - ray sources , with size being proportional to x - ray flux , and darker shading indicating harder x - ray spectra .",
    "we see from the tracks that the bright , extended population of objects in the narrow color range @xmath74 are consistent with early - type galaxies and spirals at low to moderate redshifts ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "our optical data confirm that we see both early - type and spiral morphologies for these objects , and those preliminary redshifts which are available ( hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ) are also consistent with the expected range ( cf . table  2 ) .",
    "the range of apparent magnitudes ( @xmath76 ) is consistent with these objects being @xmath72 galaxies at these fairly moderate redshifts .",
    "we note that the spirals in this sample are generally fainter than the ellipticals , in agreement with the predictions from the redshifted tracks . finally , we find that the unresolved sources generally fall between the elliptical / spiral template tracks and those of the pure type  1 agn spectrum , suggesting that these objects are type  1 agn with smaller , varying admixtures of host galaxy contributions to the total flux .",
    "these point - like sources are also bluer , for a given magnitude , than the resolved sources .",
    "the colors of these objects are similar to starbursts , however their x - ray luminosities are higher than those expected for typical starbursts , thus we conclude that they are more likely to be agn .",

    "moreover , the one object in this faint group for which we have a preliminary redshift ( j033208.3@xmath15274153 ) is a nelg with @xmath82 , leading to an x - ray luminosity estimate of @xmath83  erg  s@xmath70 , in the rest frame energy range of @xmath84 .",

    "as stated earlier , the lack of objects at lower @xmath77 , i.e. in the lower left corner of the plot , is not an observational bias .",
    "as we move to even lower values of @xmath77 , we would eventually reach levels consistent with x - ray emission from normal galaxies .",
    "the unresolved sources tend to have higher @xmath77 , reflecting the relative dominance of agn emission over host galaxy contribution over these mostly type  1 agn .",
    "note also that the optical non - detections ( lower right ) are consistent with the high @xmath77 ratio of the faint population .    for fainter x - ray flux detection limits ,",
    "our models predict a substantial increase in the number of optically faint counterparts , the majority of which should be obscured agn at reasonably high redshifts of @xmath85 ( cf .",

    "if galaxy activity and x - ray emission were correlated with local environment , e.g. , from interaction - induced star formation and/or feeding of a central bh , we might expect to see more near neighbors around the _ cxo_-detected galaxies than typical for the field .",

    "although the chi - square test gives a high probability ( 0.49 ) of the null hypothesis that the two histograms are consistent with a single nearest - neighbor distribution function , the analysis would greatly benefit from enlarging the _ cxo_-detected population with wider optical coverage ( and with the 940  ksec cdfs data ) .",

    "the brighter population is both significantly brighter and significantly redder on average than the population of field sources .",
    "the fainter population ( only five sources ) is consistent in its color distribution with the field galaxy population .",
    "there is no significant difference in x - ray hardness between the groups , although in each group , the harder sources appear marginally redder .",
    "the optically bright x - ray sources identified with resolved galaxies are redder than the overall population of bright sources and lie in a narrow range of color : @xmath62 , over a magnitude range of @xmath94 .",
    "these values are consistent with @xmath72 galaxies at moderate redshifts of 0.5 to 1.2 , comparable to the range of preliminary redshifts already measured ( cf .",

    "the high x - ray luminosities suggest that most of these harbor agn .",
    "the redder colors of the _ cxo _ optical counterparts further imply that these agn hosts are dusty , as might be expected if mergers were associated with nuclear activity .",
    "the spirals in this sample are also generally fainter than the ellipticals , as expected from the comparison of their colors and luminosities with predicted galaxy templates .",
    "the bright population of galaxies lies well above our optical detection threshold , suggesting that these comprise a relatively sparse , volume - limited and not flux - limited population .",
    "the optically faint group of _ cxo _ sources is consistent in color distribution with the field galaxy population .",
    "these sources are likely to be high redshift type  2 agn ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "they appear softer than the nearer type  2 agn because their unobscured hard x - ray emission is substantially redshifted into the _ cxo _ soft band .",
    "we predict that at still fainter x - ray flux limits , we will find substantially more of the faint optical counterparts , but few additional members of the resolved brighter population .    in conclusion , we note that these _ hst _ observations cover only some @xmath95 of the full - depth 300  ksec cdfs area ( tozzi et al .",

    "our current results suggest that _ hst_/wfpc2 or acs exposures of the cdfs at @xmath96 mag arcsec@xmath97 can easily resolve the optical counterparts of many more of the chandra sources in our fainter population .",

    "these initial results already demonstrate the ability of _ hst _ , in a relatively modest amount of observing time , to readily detect the host galaxies of distant , low - luminosity agn and to reveal their morphology .",
