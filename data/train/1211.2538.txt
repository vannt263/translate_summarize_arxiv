    "it is known that nuclear masses are of great importance for the study of super - heavy nuclei @xcite , nuclear symmetry energy @xcite and nuclear astrophysics @xcite . for the synthesis of super - heavy nuclei ( shn ) , a reliable nuclear mass formula is required for providing some valuable information on the central position of the `` island of stability '' , the position of proton drip line and the properties of shn at their ground states .",
    "in addition , most of masses for nuclei along the r - process path have not yet been measured .",
    "accurate predictions for the masses of these extremely neutron - rich nuclei play a key role for the study of nuclear astrophysics .",
    "available nuclear mass formulas include some global and local formulas .",
    "for the global formulas , the model parameters are usually determined by all measured masses and the masses of almost all bound nuclei can be calculated .",
    "some global nuclear mass models have been successfully established , such as the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite which is based on the macroscopic - microscopic method , the hartree - fock - bogliubov ( hfb ) model @xcite , the duflo - zuker formula @xcite and the weizs \" acker - skyrme formula @xcite .",
    "these models can reproduce the measured masses with accuracy at the level of 600 to 300 kev .",
    "the local mass formulas are generally based on algebraic or systematic approaches .",
    "they predict the masses of unknown nuclei from the masses of known neighboring nuclei , such as the garvey - kelson relations @xcite , the isobaric multiplet mass equation , the residual proton - neutron interactions @xcite and the image reconstruction technique ( like the clean algorithm @xcite and the radial basis function method @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficult of the local mass formulas is that the model errors rapidly increase for nuclei far from the measured nuclei . for neutron drip line nuclei and super - heavy nuclei ,",
    "the differences between the calculated masses from these different models are quite large .",
    "it is therefore necessary to check the reliability and predictive power of the nuclear mass formulas .",
    "in ref . @xcite an improved nuclear mass formula , weizs \" acker - skyrme mass formula , was proposed .",
    "the total energy of a nucleus is written as a sum of the liquid - drop energy , the strutinsky shell correction @xmath1 and the residual correction @xmath2 , @xmath3 the liquid - drop energy of a spherical nucleus @xmath4 is described by a modified bethe - weizscker mass formula , @xmath5 with the isospin asymmetry @xmath6 and the coulomb energy , @xmath7    in the original bethe - weizscker formula , the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath8 is simply written as a constant . to consider the surface - symmetry energy of finite nuclei , the mass - dependence of the @xmath8 was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . to check the mass - dependence of @xmath8",
    ", we have studied the symmetry energy coefficients of finite nuclei based on the experimental data for masses @xcite .",
    "the liquid - drop energy which is a function of mass number @xmath9 and charge number @xmath10 can also be expressed as a function of @xmath9 and the isospin asymmetry @xmath11 . by performing a partial derivative of the liquid - drop energy per particle with respect to @xmath11 , the symmetry energy coefficients of finite nuclei can be extracted .",
    "in addition to the mass - dependence of @xmath8 , the isospin dependence of the symmetry energy coefficients of finite nuclei can also be clearly observed . to consider the isospin dependence of @xmath12",
    ", we proposed a new form for the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath13,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with which the mass- and isospin - dependence of @xmath8 can be reproduced reasonably well .",
    "the @xmath14 term in @xmath8 represents the traditional wigner effect @xcite . with the proposed form for @xmath8",
    ", we found that the accuracy of the liquid - drop formula can be improved by @xmath15 and the value of @xmath16 which represents the nuclear symmetry energy at normal density goes up to about 30 mev ( very close to the extracted value from other approaches ) .",
    "furthermore , it was found that the model parameters in the liquid - drop formula with the proposed form of @xmath8 are quite stable for different mass region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 term empirically describes the pairing effect with @xmath18 the influence of nuclear deformations on the liquid - drop energy is considered based on a parabolic approximation .",
    "we studied the variation of the energy of a nucleus as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 by using the skyrme energy - density functional plus the extended thomas - fermi approach @xcite , and found that the parabolic approximation is applicable for small deformations .",
    "the terms with @xmath21 in eq.(1 ) describe the contribution of nuclear deformation ( including @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 ) to the macroscopic energy .",
    "mass dependence of the curvatures @xmath21 is written as @xcite , @xmath23 according to the skyrme energy - density functional , which greatly reduces the computation time for the calculation of deformed nuclei .",
    "the microscopic shell correction @xmath24 is obtained with the traditional strutinsky procedure by setting the order @xmath25 of the gauss - hermite polynomials and the smoothing parameter @xmath26 with @xmath27 mev . @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the shell energy of a nucleus and of its mirror nucleus , respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 term in @xmath1 is to take into account the mirror nuclei constraint @xcite from the isospin symmetry , with which the accuracy of the mass model can be significantly improved by @xmath30 without introducing any new model parameters .",
    "the charge - symmetry and charge - independence of nuclear force implies the energies of a pair of mirror nuclei should be close to each other if removing the coulomb term . combining the macro - micro method , one finds that the difference of the shell correction for mirror nuclei should be close to each other .",
    "the experimental data also support this point . from the traditional strutinsky",
    "shell correction calculations , we note that the difference of the shell correction reaches a few mev for some nuclei . the new expression for the shell correction in which the shell energy of the mirror nucleus is also involved , is proposed to consider the mirror effect .    in the calculations of the shell corrections ,",
    "the single - particle levels are obtained under an axially deformed woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the isospin - dependent spin - orbit strength is adopted based on the skyrme energy - density functional , @xmath31 with @xmath32 for protons and @xmath33 for neutrons , which strongly affects the shell structure of neutron - rich nuclei and super - heavy nuclei .    in this formula",
    ", we also consider the wigner effect of heavy nuclei coming from the approximate symmetry between valence protons and neutrons .",
    "we found that some heavy doubly magic nuclei , such as @xmath34sn , @xmath35pb and @xmath36hs , lie along a straight line @xmath37 .",
    "the shell corrections of nuclei are approximately symmetric along this straight line .",
    "the wigner effect of heavy nuclei causes the nuclei along this line are more bound .",
    "the term @xmath38 is to consider this effect and reduces the rms error by @xmath15 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "finally , we would like to introduce a very efficient and powerful systematic correction to the global nuclear mass formulas - radial basis function ( rbf ) correction @xcite .",
    "the rbf approach is a prominent global interpolation and extrapolation scheme for scattered data fitting .",
    "it is widely used in surface reconstruction . based on a global nuclear mass formula and",
    "known masses , the differences between model calculation and experimental data are analyzed .",
    "the aim of the rbf approach is to find a smooth function @xmath39 to describe the differences @xmath40 .",
    "once the reconstructed function @xmath41 is obtained , the revised masses for unmeasured nuclei are given by @xmath42 .",
    "here , @xmath43 denotes the calculated mass from a global nuclear mass model .",
    "we find that the rbf correction can improve the accuracy of a global mass formula by @xmath44 to @xmath45 without introducing any new model parameters .",
