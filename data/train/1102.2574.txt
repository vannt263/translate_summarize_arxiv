    "the photoproduction of hyperons off the nucleon target is important in hadron physics since it reveals the strangeness - related interaction structures of hadrons .",
    "many experimental collaborations , such as clas at jafferson laboratory  @xcite , leps at spring-8  @xcite , etc , have performed energetic research activities for the photoproductions . up to the resonance region",
    "@xmath4 gev , a simple hadronic model including the tree - level diagrams has successfully explained the experimental data .",
    "however , as energy increases , this simple model needs to be extended to accommodate the effects from the interactions at the quark level . to reach this goal , mesonic regge trajectories , corresponding to all the meson exchanges with the same quantum numbers but different spins in @xmath1 channel at tree level ,",
    "were employed  @xcite .    in the present report",
    ", we investigate the @xmath5 photoproduction off the proton target , @xmath6 , beyond the resonance region with the extended model including the original hadronic model and the interpolated regge contributions . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , up to the resonance region , this production process is largely dominated by the contact - term contribution .",
    "note that this interesting feature supported by the experiments  @xcite is a consequence of gauge invariance in a certain description for spin-@xmath7 fermions .",
    "for instance , according to it , 1 ) one can expect a significant difference in the production strengths .",
    "we present the energy and angular dependences , photon - beam asymmetry , and polarization - transfer coefficients of the production process .",
    "furthermore the @xmath2-angle distributions function , @xmath8 in the gottfried - jackson frame using the polarization transfer coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also computed . due to the limited volume for the conference proceeding",
    ", we would like to focus on the @xmath2-angle distribution function here .",
    "more detailed results for various physical observables can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of our research focusses in the present report is the @xmath2-angle distribution function  @xcite , which is the angle distribution of @xmath2 , decayed from @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , in the @xmath1-channel helicity frame , i.e. the gottfried - jackson frame  @xcite . from this function ,",
    "one can see which meson - exchange contribution dominates the production process . according to a simple spin statistics ,",
    "the function becomes @xmath13 for @xmath11 in @xmath14 , whereas @xmath15 for @xmath11 in @xmath16 : @xmath17 where we have used a notation @xmath8 indicating the distribution function for convenience .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the strength of each spin state of @xmath11 , satisfying the normalization @xmath20 .",
    "now , we want to provide theoretical estimations on @xmath8 .",
    "taking into account the outgoing kaon ( @xmath21 ) does carry zero spin , all the photon helicity will be transffered to @xmath11 through the exchanging particle in @xmath1-channel , hence , it is natural to think that the polarization - transfer coefficients in the @xmath3 direction should relate to the strength coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath18 and @xmath19 in terms of the polarization transfer coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 as follows : @xmath22 which satisfy the normalization condition . in other words",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the strength that @xmath11 is in its @xmath14 state , and @xmath19 for @xmath16 similarly .    in ( a ) of figure  [ fig13 ] ,",
    "we draw @xmath8 as a function of @xmath23 for @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 gev , and @xmath26 gev at @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as seen in the figure , in the backward - scatreing region represented by @xmath29 , the curves for @xmath8 are similar to each other @xmath30 . on the contrary",
    ", they are different considerably for the forward - scattering region represented by @xmath27 , depending on @xmath31 .",
    "the curves , which are proportional to @xmath13 or @xmath15 , are mixed , and the portion of each contribution depends on @xmath31 . in ( b ) , we compare the numerical result for @xmath32 gev at @xmath33 with the experimental data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 .",
    "we normalize the experimental data with the numerical result by matching them at @xmath36 approximately .",
    "the theory and experiment are in a qualitative agreement , @xmath37 .",
    "although we did not show explicitly , theoretical result for @xmath8 changes drastically around @xmath38 . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the curve turns into @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , we compare them in ( c ) and ( d ) for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , for @xmath24 gev with ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 .",
    "again , we normalized the experimental data to the numerical result for the backward - scattering region ( d ) as done above .",
    "then , we used the same normalization for the forward - scattering region ( c ) .",
    "as shown in ( c ) , the experiment and theory starts to deviate from each other beyond @xmath43 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that there can be a small destructive interference caused by the @xmath44-exchange contribution to explain the experimental data shown in ( c ) .",
    "however , this is unlikely , since that of @xmath44 exchange only gives negligible effect on @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "hence , we consider the large deviation in ( c ) may come from the interference between @xmath11 and other hyperon contributions , which are not taken into account in the present work . as for the backward - scattering region",
    ", @xmath8 shows a curve @xmath30 , and the experimental data behaves similarly .",
    "although we have not considered the interference , for these specific angles , present theoretical estimations on @xmath18 are very similar to those given in ref .",
    "@xcite .     as a function of @xmath23 for @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 gev , and @xmath26 gev at @xmath27 and @xmath28 in ( a ) . in ( b ) , we compare the numerical result for @xmath24 gev and @xmath45 with the experimental data taken from ref .  @xcite . similarly , we show the comparisons in ( c ) and ( d ) for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , with ref .",
    "see the text for details.,width=604 ]",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0 photorproduciton . using the tree - level born approximation plus the regge contributions",
    ", we could reproduce the experimental data qualitatively very well .",
    "the interpolation between the feynman and regge propagators turns out to be crucial to describe the wide energy - range data .",
    "our theoretical estimations for the @xmath2-angle distribution function can be a useful guide for the future experiments .",
    "although the nucleon resonance contributions seem negligible for relatively wide - angle regions , hyperon resonances may play an important role , since the backward scattering regions have not been reproduced well .",
    "moreover , the asymmetric curve for the @xmath2-angle distribution at @xmath46 in the experimental data , being different from the numerical result , must be addressed carefully in the further studies .",
    "related works will appear elsewhere .",
