    "not only the mechanical moduli become complex and frequency dependent @xcite , but so do standard thermodynamic linear - response properties like the specific heat or the thermal expansion coefficient @xcite .    of the twelve basic complex , frequency - dependent thermodynamic linear - response coefficients only three are independent ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and its references ) .",
    "if one assumes stochastic dynamics , which is believed to be realistic for viscous liquids on time scales much longer than phonon times , in fact only two thermoviscoelastic response functions are truly independent @xcite .",
    "no reliable measurements of a full set of ( three ) thermoviscoelastic response function appear to exist for any highly viscous liquid .",
    "part of the reason for this may be the traditional focus in physics on phenomena on the molecular scale , but part of the problem most likely also comes from the considerable challenges associated with reliably measuring the thermoviscoelastic response functions .",
    "the problem is that the coupling between mechanics and thermodynamics caused by thermal expansion is nontrivial when the mechanical shear modulus is a significant fraction of the bulk modulus @xcite .",
    "this is true for solids in general , as well as for highly viscous liquids at frequencies of order the inverse relaxation time . for solids ,",
    "however , because the isobaric and isochoric specific heats are almost identical , the problem is not serious .",
    "for ultraviscous liquids , on the other hand , the problem can not be ignored . for such systems",
    "it was recently shown that the thermomechanical coupling implies that conventional methods fail to measure the isobaric , frequency - dependent specific heat @xcite .",
    "this is because truly isobaric conditions are difficult to establish experimentally due to the thermal expansion upon heating ; in most experiments attempting to measure the frequency - dependent specific heat the stress tensor is not proportional to the unit tensor ( i.e. , there is not hydrostatic equilibrium ) , and shear stresses relax on the very time scale that one wishes to monitor .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish the theoretical framework for measuring a complete set of thermoviscoelastic response functions utilizing spherical symmetry .",
    "the thermomechanical equations describing the coupling of mechanics to thermodynamics are well known since many years @xcite .",

    "note that the entropy production is quadratic in the perturbations , implying that entropy is conserved to first order @xcite , a fact that is utilized below .",
    "it follows from the above that the generic conjugated variables for a small system that relaxes mechanically and thermally with no shear forces are @xmath34 and @xmath35 . from an experimental point of view , however , it is not convenient only to consider an infinitesimal volume , @xmath24 . if one wishes to study relaxation on a time scale @xmath36 , the volume @xmath24 may only be considered small if the heat diffusion time @xmath37 across the volume is much smaller than @xmath36 .",

    "a further complication arises when the shear modulus becomes comparable to the bulk modulus , which is the case in the relaxation region of viscous liquids . in this case heat diffusion and mechanical stresses couple",

    "<S> once the transfer matrix has been calculated , it is fairly easy to deduce the equations describing various experimentally relevant special cases ( boundary conditions that are adiabatic , isothermal , isochoric , etc . ) . in most situations </S>",
    "<S> the relevant frequency - dependent specific heat is the longitudinal specific heat , a quantity that is in between the isochoric and isobaric frequency - dependent specific heats . </S>"
