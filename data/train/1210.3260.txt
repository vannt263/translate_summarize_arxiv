    "an interesting extension , which is also relevant experimentally,@xcite is a junction of y - shape , at which a single qd is coupled to one normal and two superconducting ( sc ) leads as shown in fig .",

    "this system has been studied by pala , governale and knig , using a real - time diagrammatic approach based on a perturbation expansion with respect to the tunneling matrix elements .",
    "@xcite their calculations reveal precise features of the josephson current and andreev bound states both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations where a finite bias voltage is applied between the dot and the normal lead .",
    "however , their approach is not applicable at low temperatures @xmath13 , and thus the competition between superconductivity and the kondo effect occurring in this system has been left to be explored .",
    "specifically , in the y - junction the conduction electrons from the normal lead can screen the local moment induced in the qd .",
    "this changes the sharp transition between the magnetic and non - magnetic ground states into a crossover between a kondo singlet and a cooper - pairing singlet .",
    "furthermore , the andreev scattering , which takes place between the qd and normal lead , can be controlled through the phase difference @xmath1 between the order parameters of two sc leads .",
    "this is because the sc proximity on the qd depends sensitively on the properties of the junctions , and thus on @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , the josephson current flowing between the two sc leads is affected by the andreev scattering of the conduction electrons from the normal lead .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study these interplays of the kondo , andreev , and josephson effects which can be observed for the qd embedded in this three terminal system.@xcite to this end , we explore a wide region of the parameter space of this y - junction , varying the position of a quantized energy level @xmath0 of the qd modeled with an anderson impurity , and also examine how an asymmetry of the josephson junction affects the low - temperature properties .",

    ", the sc pair correlations can penetrate into the qd and create a local cooper pair , consisting of a linear combination of an empty state and a doubly occupied state .",
    "the essential physics of the local cooper pairing can be deduced from the fixed point of the nrg in the limit of @xmath16 , where the coherence becomes of the order of the lattice constant .",
    "we consider in detail this large sc gap limit in the present work .",
    "the low - lying energy states of this y - junction can be described by a local fermi liquid of the interacting bogoliubov particles .",
    "this is because the normal lead , coupled to the qd , has a continuous energy spectrum at the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , the local sc pair potential @xmath17 is induced in the qd by the proximity effect .",
    "this @xmath17 also plays a central role , and it varies sensitively with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for instance , the conductance due to andreev scattering can be expressed at @xmath18 in terms of phase shift @xmath19 for the renormalized quasiparticles and the angle @xmath20 of the bogoliubov rotation determined by @xmath21 , and is enhanced at the crossover region between the kondo singlet and local - cooper pairing singlet.@xcite we also calculate the renormalized parameters for the interacting bogoliubov particles .",
    "the results of the renormalization factor @xmath22 , the wilson ratio @xmath23 , and the renormalized andreev level @xmath24 that corresponds to quasiparticle peak position appearing in the spectral function of the qd , provide us with sufficient information to understand the ground - state properties of the system thoroughly .",

    "the conductance due to the andreev scattering is proportional to @xmath320 , and thus has a peak when the phase shift takes the value of @xmath263 at crossover region between the local - cooper pairing and kondo singlet states .",
    "we see in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : yj_cond_asm ] that the position of the conductance peak shifts towards the larger @xmath1 side as @xmath19 becomes smaller with increasing @xmath310 .",
    "this also shows that the asymmetric coupling favors the sc proximity into the dot , and enlarges the parameter region for the local - cooper - pairing ground state .",
    "furthermore , the crossover behavior from the local - cooper pairing to the kondo regime , seen for the josephson current in the lower right panel for @xmath321 , is smeared as @xmath310 increases , and the current shows a simple sinusoidal @xmath1 dependence for large asymmetries .",
    "we have studied the crossover between a kondo singlet and a local - copper - pairing singlet , occurring in a quantum dot coupled to one normal and two sc leads .",
    "the low - energy states of the system can be described by excitations from a local fermi - liquid ground state of interacting bogoliubov particles . specifically in this three terminal configuration , the renormalized parameters for the quasiparticles vary as functions of the josephson phase @xmath1 , and the crossover occurs at finite @xmath322 as the phase difference varies in the range @xmath323 .",
    "we have calculated the phase shift @xmath19 , the renormalization factor @xmath22 , the renormalized andreev level @xmath190 , and the wilson raton @xmath23 in the large sc gap limit @xmath324 , using the nrg , and have deduced the transport properties at @xmath18 .",
    "the bogoliubov particles are strongly renormalized in the kondo regime while the renormalization is a minor effect in the local - cooper - pairing regime which corresponds to the _ frozen - impurity _ fixed point of the nrg . near the crossover between the two regimes",
    "a pair of renormalized andreev levels @xmath190 approach the fermi level , and the conductance between the dot and normal lead has a peak .",
    "the josephson current between the two sc leads is suppressed significantly in the kondo regime .",
    "we have also presented the spectral function calculated with the nrg .",
    "the results demonstrate precise features of the original andreev levels , which for the local - cooper - pairing state are broadened by @xmath159 and then renormalized as @xmath6 increases . in the kondo regime , the pair of renormalized andreev levels overlap to form a single peak near the fermi level while at high energies four additional peaks are visible .",
    "these peaks correspond to the excitations to the upper and lower atomic peaks , which are defined with respect to the bogoliubov particles and consist of a linear combination of the empty and doubly occupied electron states .",
    "thus , the broadened bare andreev peaks and a low energy feature corresponding to a kondo resonance can appear within the superconducting gap .",
    "for suitable parameters this should be observable experimentally in the discussed y - shape geometry .",
