    "considerable attention has been focused recently on the casimir effect @xcite which is a rare manifestation of the zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field at macroscopic scales .",
    "the casimir force arises as response to the change of the spectrum of zero - point oscillations when material boundaries are present .",
    "it acts between the boundaries of these bodies and depends on the parameters of their materials , their geometry ( including surface roughness ) , and on the temperature ( for a detailed information see the monographs and reviews @xcite ) .",
    "currently , many precision measurements of the casimir force between metal boundaries have been performed @xcite .",
    "their results were used for constraining hypothetical forces predicted by unified gauge theories of fundamental interactions @xcite and in nanotechnological applications @xcite .    with respect to the present state of the art ,",
    "the theoretical description of the casimir force calls for a careful account of all material properties and other relevant factors .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that the calculations of the temperature effect on the casimir force between real metals of finite conductivity run into serious troubles which have been the subject of much controversy @xcite . the key contradiction is on whether the term of the lifshitz formula @xcite related to the zero matsubara frequency for the _ perpendicular _ polarized modes of an electromagnetic field contributes to the physical quantities and , if so , how much would its contribution be . at the moment",
    "there are five distinct approaches to the resolution of this problem in the recent literature , namely :    * according to the first approach , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and supported in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the case of real metals the term of the lifshitz formula with zero matsubara frequency should be calculated by using the drude dielectric function . as a result",
    ", the perpendicular polarized modes do not contribute to this term .",
    "* in the other approach @xcite a special modification of the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula , supplemented by the drude model , was proposed leading to a nonzero contribution of the perpendicular polarized modes .",
    "this modification was done by analogy with the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite for an ideal metal but it does not coincide with it . * in the framework of the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite the modification of the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula was made identical to that for an ideal metal @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "@xcite the contribution of the perpendicular polarized modes with zero matsubara frequency is nonzero and should be calculated by substituting the free electron plasma dielectric function into the unmodified lifshitz formula . * finally ,",
    "according to the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , the description of the thermal casimir force can be obtained by using the leontovich surface impedance boundary condition ( recently this approach was applied also in ref .",

    "@xcite it is restricted by the range of only cryogenic temperatures , and in ref .",
    "@xcite by the case of sufficiently large separation distances and by the presence of thin covering metallic films . the approach ( b ) , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to resolve the contradictions arising for the drude model in combination with the lifshitz formula , was considered later in ref .",
    "@xcite as unnecessary as the drude model itself turned out to be irrelevant for the description of the thermal casimir force between real metals .",
    "it should be particularly emphasized that the approaches ( a ) and ( c ) were proved to be in contradiction with thermodynamics @xcite since they violate the nernst heat theorem .",

    "the present paper aims to work out quite clearly that the surface impedance approach provides an answer to all the complicated problems with the retarded casimir force between real metals at both zero and nonzero temperature .",
    "we demonstrate that the main reason why the drude model in combination with the lifshitz theory had failed to describe the thermal casimir force is the inadequacy of the standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field depending only on frequency inside a lossy real metal .",
    "rather than to consider fluctuations inside a metal , the surface impedance approach suggests that the effective boundary conditions take into consideration in a noncontradictory way the involved reflection properties from the surface of a real conductor . in this case",
    "no additional prescriptions are needed , and the values of the zero - frequency contributions for both parallel and perpendicular modes follow immediately from the explicit form of the impedance function .    on this basis , we present for the first time a derivation of the formula for the casimir free energy and force in a configuration of two parallel plates in the surface impedance approach ( in ref .  @xcite it was presented without proof by the use of a prescription changing the integration over continuous frequencies for the summation over the discrete matsubara frequencies ) .",
    "the necessity of this derivation results from the fundamental role played by the concept of the surface impedance in the theory of the casimir effect between real metals .",
    "the relationship between this formula and the lifshitz formula for the free energy is found ( the new formula is obtained by exchanging the reflection coefficients , which appear in the lifshitz formula , for the ones derived in the surface impedance approach ) .",
    "our derivation starts from the free energy of the oscillators and suggests also other means to derive the usual lifshitz formula for the thermal casimir force between dielectrics .",
    "the obtained formula is applied to compute the casimir free energy and force at different temperatures and separation distances between the test bodies . to do this",
    ", one has to use the impedance functions describing the regions of infrared optics , anomalous or normal skin effect depending on the value of the characteristic frequency giving the main contribution to the casimir force .",
    "it is shown that no contradictions with thermodynamics arise , and no artificial prescriptions for the zero - frequency term are needed ( we also demonstrate that the predictions of large temperature corrections to the casimir force at small separations and cryogenic temperatures , made in ref .",
    "@xcite , are in error since the impedance of the anomalous skin effect was used in @xcite outside its range of application ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we demonstrate the inadequacy of the concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field inside lossy real metals and remind the basic facts from the theory of surface impedance .",
    "iii is devoted to the derivation of the electromagnetic oscillation spectrum between two parallel plates starting from the impedance boundary condition . in sec .",
    "iv the formula for the casimir free energy is derived in the surface impedance approach .",
    "the new simple derivation of the usual lifshitz formula for the thermal casimir force between dielectrics is also given here .",
    "v contains the calculations of the casimir energy and force at zero temperature using the impedance approach .",
    "the results are compared with the previously known ones , obtained by the use of the usual lifshitz formula and the tabulated optical data , and found to be in agreement . in sec .",
    "vi the computations at nonzero temperature are performed in the impedance approach at different separation distances between the test bodies .",
    "they demonstrate good agreement in transition regions between the different analytical expressions for the impedance . in sec .",
    "vii the reader finds conclusions and a discussion of the relationship between the proposed impedance approach to the casimir effect and the theory of the van der waals forces valid at small separation distances between the test bodies .",
    "it is well known that the concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field works well for the description of zero - point oscillations within media with a frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity where no real electric current does arise .",
    "we will now look at a conductor in an external electric field , which varies with some frequency @xmath0 satisfying the conditions l_n(),l , [ 1 ] where @xmath1 is the mean free path of a conduction electron , @xmath2 is the penetration depth of the field inside a metal , @xmath3 is the conductivity , and @xmath4 is the fermi velocity .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) determine the domain of the normal skin effect @xcite .",
    "in this frequency region the external field leads to the initiation of a real current of the conduction electrons .",
    "the normal skin effect is characterized by the volume relaxation described by the temperature - dependent relaxation frequency @xmath5 . as a result ,",
    "the mean free path of the conduction electrons is also temperature - dependent , @xmath6 , and increases with a decrease of temperature .",
    "the interaction of the conduction electrons with the elementary excitations of the crystal lattice ( phonons ) leads to the occurrence of electric resistance and heating of the metal .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of a metal in the domain of the normal skin effect can be modelled by the drude function ( ) = 1- , [ 2 ] where @xmath7 is the plasma frequency of the free electron plasma model ( @xmath7 is temperature - independent ) .",
    "remind that the drude dielectric function ( [ 2 ] ) was used in the approaches ( a )  ( c ) ( see introduction ) in combination with the lifshitz formula to describe the thermal casimir force between real metals for the frequencies both inside and outside of the region ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this has led to difficulties including the violation of nernst s heat theorem ( see introduction ) .",
    "the physical reason for these difficulties becomes quite clear when one observes that the usual alternating electric field with frequencies characteristic for the normal skin effect inevitably leads to heating of a metal as it penetrates through the skin layer .",
    "by contrast , the thermal photons in thermal equilibrium with a metal plate or , much less , the virtual photons ( giving rise to the casimir effect ) can not , under any circumstances , lead to the initiation of a real current and heating of the metal ( of course , this is strictly prohibited by thermodynamics ) .",
    "hence the standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field penetrating inside a metal described by the drude dielectric function fails to model virtual and thermal photons in the frequency region ( [ 1 ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the lifshitz formula can not be applied in combination with the drude dielectric function ( [ 2 ] ) to describe the thermal casimir force even in the domain of the normal skin effect .",
    "these arguments are supported also by considering the other frequency regions . at higher frequencies or larger @xmath1 ( lower temperatures ) for most of the metals the anomalous skin effect holds , which is characterized by the inequalities",
    "_ a()l,_a ( ) , [ 3 ] where the skin depth is given by @xcite",
    "_ a()=()^1/3 , [ 4 ] and @xmath8 is the total area of the fermi surface [ in fact , within the inequalities ( [ 3 ] ) `` much less '' can be replaced by `` less '' thereby preserving eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) with a good precision ] . in the frequency region of eqs .  ( [ 3 ] ) the volume relaxation is not significant but the connection between the electric field and current becomes nonlocal . because of this , a metal can not be described by any dielectric function depending only on the frequency . as with the normal skin effect , this leads to the inapplicability of the standard concept of a fluctuating field spreading inside a medium described by @xmath9 and to the impossibility to calculate the casimir force on this theoretical basis .",
    "if one would like to preserve the role of a fluctuating field within the domain of the anomalous skin effect , some nonlocal generalization of this concept is required .",
    "[ note that for some metals , especially for alloys , instead of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , the inequalities @xmath10 hold , specifying the so - called relaxation domain @xcite ; here the space dispersion is also essential . ]    on further rise of the frequency , the inequalities hold _ rl , [ 5 ] where @xmath11 , which determines the domain of infrared optics ( note that the condition @xmath12 is also supported where @xmath13 is the fermi energy ) . in this domain the volume relaxation does not play any role and the space dispersion is absent . under the conditions ( [ 5 ] ) metals can be described in the framework of the free - electron plasma model with a frequency dependent dielectric permittivity ( ) = 1- . [ 6 ] according to the plasma model , the conductivity is pure imaginary and hence there is no any real current or heating due to an electric field penetrating into the metal .",
    "because of this , the standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field , as a model for the virtual and thermal photons , works well in the domain of infrared optics .",
    "remind that the plasma model dielectric permittivity in combination with the lifshitz formula was used to calculate the thermal casimir force [ see approach ( d ) from the introduction ] .",
    "this approach did not meet any difficulties or contradictions with the basic principles of thermodynamics and has led to physically reasonable results .",
    "the domain of infrared optics is followed by the domain of ultraviolet frequencies where metals become transparent .    as is evident from the foregoing",
    ", the standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field , penetrating into a metal described by the dielectric permittivity depending only on frequency can not be used as an adequate model for the virtual and thermal photons of some frequencies .",
    "there is a frequency region ( the domain of the normal skin effect ) where this model is in conflict with the basic properties of virtual and thermal photons at equilibrium which , among other things , can not lead to heating of a metal .",
    "in addition , in the region of the anomalous skin effect and relaxation domain a metal can not be described by the dielectric permittivity depending only on frequency . because of this , another theoretical basis is preferred to find the thermal casimir force between real metals different from the one used in the case of dielectrics . here",
    "we show that this basis is given by the concept of the surface impedance introduced by m.  a.  leontovich @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference of the surface impedance approach from the usual approaches is that it permits not to consider the electromagnetic fluctuations inside a metal .",
    "instead , the appropriate boundary conditions are imposed taking into account the properties of real metal _",
    "t = z ( ) , [ 7 ] where @xmath14 is the surface impedance of the conductor , @xmath15 and @xmath15 are the tangential components of electric and magnetic fields , and is the unit normal vector to the surface ( pointing inside the metal ) .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ 7 ] ) can be used to determine the electromagnetic field outside a metal .",
    "note , that the impedance @xmath14 and the condition ( [ 7 ] ) suggest a more universal description than the one by means of @xmath16 .",
    "they still hold under the inequalities ( [ 3 ] ) where a description in terms of the dielectric permittivity @xmath9 is impossible . for an ideal metal",
    "we have @xmath17 and for real nonmagnetic metals @xmath18 holds @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the surface impedance over the whole frequency axis is based on the kinetic theory @xcite and is rather cumbersome . however , in the domains of the normal and the anomalous skin effect , and also for infrared optics , simple asymptotic expressions follow which are of great help to compute the casimir force between real metals .",
    "thus , in the domain of the normal skin effect , given by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , the surface impedance is @xcite z_n()=(1-i ) .",
    "[ 8 ]    in the domain of the anomalous skin effect , determined by eq .",

    "one obtains an approximately spherical fermi surface and the impedance is @xcite z_a()= , [ 9 ] where @xmath19 was defined in eq .",

    "[ 10 ]    now one can impose the impedance boundary condition ( [ 7 ] ) on the surface of metal plates , find the oscillation spectrum in the space between the plates and calculate the casimir free energy density and force without consideration of a fluctuating electromagnetic field inside the metal .",

    "another approach , being similar in spirit , was used at @xmath20 in ref .",
    "@xcite where the reflection coefficients in the lifshitz formula were expressed in terms of @xmath14 .",
    "now , the question arises what expression for the impedance ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) or ( [ 10 ] ) should be used to calculate the casimir effect . to answer this question , it is good to bear in the mind that the main contribution to the casimir free energy and force is given by the frequency region centered around the so - called characteristic frequency @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the space separation between the two bodies , parallel plates for instance .",

    "the application region ( [ 3 ] ) of the anomalous skin effect at @xmath26k is very narrow and extends up to around @xmath27rad / s .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that with the decrease of temperature the application region of the normal skin effect practically disappears and the anomalous skin effect extends to all frequencies being lesser than @xmath25rad / s .",

    "m are equal or different , can be answered experimentally using the measurement scheme suggested recently in ref .",
    "we expect that the experimental result will be in accordance with the suggestion of the physical intuition ( note that this example with two pairs of plates was used with another aim in ref .",
    "in the foregoing we have presented the surface impedance approach to the theory of the casimir effect at both zero and nonzero temperature . in the impedance approach the effective boundary condition",
    "is imposed taking the real properties of the metal into account .",
    "previously this approach was considered as nothing more than a useful approximation to the more complete lifshitz theory using the concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field both outside and inside the boundary of the bodies .",
    "our conclusion is that the standard concept of a fluctuating field inside a metal , described by the dielectric permittivity depending only on frequency , in the region where a real current may arise , can not serve as an adequate model for the zero - point oscillations and thermal photons .",
    "it follows from the fact that the vacuum oscillations and the thermal photons in equilibrium under no circumstances can lead to a heating of the metal .",
    "if this fact is overlooked , contradictions with the thermodynamics arise when one substitutes into the lifshitz formula for the casimir free energy and force the drude dielectric function which takes into account the volume relaxation and , consequently , the joule heating .",
    "this situation reflects the nontrivial character of quantum fluctuations in nonhomogeneous case involving both vacuum and real metals , containing conduction electrons , in different spatial regions .",
    "in fact , in such cases the quantized electromagnetic field at nonzero temperature may not be represented in terms of ( quasi)-particles @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the concept of a fluctuating field becomes not so transparent as in nonlossy dielectric media .    in the light of this conclusion",
    ", the surface impedance approach takes on fundamental importance as ( at present ) the only self - consistent description of the casimir effect between real metals .",
    "it does not need any prescription for the zero - frequency contribution to the casimir energy and force . in all cases",
    "the correct expressions for the values of both reflection coefficients with two different polarizations at zero frequency are deduced from the general theoretical framework using the explicit form of the impedance function ( see sec .",
    "thus , a long discussion in the recent literature concerning the most adequate modification of the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula @xcite can be finalized .",
    "the surface impedance approach solves the puzzle with the violation of the nernst heat theorem and with negative values of entropy which appears when one substitutes the drude dielectric function into the usual lifshitz formula . in the impedance approach",
    "the entropy is in all cases nonnegative and takes zero value at zero temperature .",
    "thus , the general formulas given by eqs .",
    "( [ 41 ] ) , ( [ 42 ] ) , ( [ 43 ] ) , ( [ 46 ] ) , ( [ 48 ] ) , and ( [ 53 ] ) lay the theoretical basis for the calculation of the thermal casimir effect with respect to the needs of future precision experiments .",
    "the computations performed in secs .",
    "v , vi are in good agreement with the previous results obtained by the use of the optical tabulated data and the plasma model .",
    "the obtained results allow to remove the doubts that something is wrong with the lifshitz formula @xcite .",
    "in fact , the above formulas in the framework of the impedance approach coincide with the lifshitz formula .",
    "the only difference is that for real metals in the frequency regions , where the electromagnetic oscillations initiate a real current or where the space dispersion is essential , one must express the reflection coefficients not in terms of the dielectric permittivity but in terms of the surface impedance . the usual lifshitz formula , formulated in terms of the dielectric permittivity , preserves , however , major importance not only in applications to dielectrics but also in the theory of the non - retarded van der waals forces between metallic surfaces . as was mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , the surface impedance approach is applicable with the proviso that @xmath170 , i.e. , the separation distances between the test bodies must satisfy the condition @xmath171 .",
    "in essence , the frequency region @xmath172 is a subject of the optics of real metals near the plasma frequency @xcite . at separations @xmath173 between the test bodies the temperature effects are negligible .",
    "this is a region of the ultraviolet transparency where metals can be described on the same basis as dielectrics .",
    "the most adequate approach to the theory of the van der waals forces at so small separations is given by the hydrodynamical description of an inhomogeneous electron gas @xcite .",
    "this is a more general approach if compared with the lifshitz theory because it does not start with a model description of a metal in terms of the bulk dielectric permittivity . in the local limit , however , when the spatial dispersion is absent , the hydrodynamical approach leads to the usual lifshitz formula at zero temperature @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the usual lifshitz formula is well adapted for the calculation of the van der waals forces between real metals at separations @xmath173 if @xmath174 being obtained by the use of optical tabulated data for the complex refraction index ( the extension of the avalible tabulated data into the region of small frequencies makes almost no effect on the computational results ) .",
    "in conclusion it may be said that the lifshitz formula in combination with the impedance approach gives a solid foundation for the investigation of thermal effects onto the casimir force .",
    "this approach does not lead to contradictions and can be used as the theoretical basis for the needs of future experiments .",
