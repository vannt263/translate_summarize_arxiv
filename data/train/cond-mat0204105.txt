    "granular gases , i.e. systems of inelastically colliding particles , are widely spread in nature",
    ". they may be exemplified by industrial dust or interterrestrial dust ; the behavior of matter in planetary rings is also described in terms of the granular gas dynamics .",
    "as compared with common molecular gases , the steady removal of kinetic energy in these systems due to dissipative collisions causes a variety of nonequilibrium phenomena , which have been very intensively studied ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in most of these studies",
    "the coefficient of restitution , which characterizes the energy lost in the collisions , was assumed to be constant .",
    "this approximation , although providing a considerable simplification , and allowing to understand the main effects in granular gas dynamics , is not always justified ( see also the paper by thornton in this book  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , sometimes it occurs to be too crude to describe even qualitatively the features of granular gases . here",
    "we discuss the properties of granular gases consisting of viscoelastically colliding particles which implies an impact - velocity dependent restitution coefficient .",
    "the results are compared with results for gases consisting of particles which interact via a constant restitution coefficient and we see that the natural assumption of viscoelasticity leads to _ qualitative _ modifications of the gas properties .    the following problems will be addressed :    1 .   why does the restitution coefficient @xmath0 depend on the impact velocity @xmath1 ?",
    "2 .   how does it depend on the impact velocity ?",
    "3 .   what are the consequences of the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 on the collective behavior of particles in granular gases ?",
    "in particular how does @xmath3 influence : * the evolution of temperature with time ? * the evolution of the velocity distribution function with time ? * the self - diffusion in granular gases ?    in what follows",
    "we will show that the dependence of the restitution coefficient on the impact velocity is a very basic property of dissipative particle collisions , whereas the assumption of a constant restitution coefficient for the collision of three - dimensional spheres may lead to a physically incorrect dependence of the dissipative force on the compression rate of the colliding particles . from the hertz collision law and the general relation between the elastic and dissipative forces",
    "we deduce the dependence of the restitution coefficient on the impact velocity , which follows purely from scaling considerations .",
    "we also give the corresponding relation obtained from rigorous theory . using the dependence @xmath2 we derive the time dependence of the temperature , the time - evolution of the velocity distribution function and describe self - diffusion in granular gases in the homogeneous cooling regime .",
    "the collision of two particles may be characterized by the compression @xmath4 and by the compression rate @xmath5 , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the compression gives rise to the elastic force @xmath6 , while the dissipative force @xmath7 appears due to the compression rate .",
    "if the compression and the compression rate are not very large , one can assume the dependence of the elastic and dissipative force on @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath8 the dimension analysis yields the following functional form for the dependence of the restitution coefficient on the impact velocity @xcite :    @xmath9    therefore , the condition for a constant restitution coefficient imposes the relation between the exponents @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite :    @xmath13    for compressions which do not exceed the plasticity threshold , the particle s material behaves as a viscoelastic medium",
    ". then it may be generally shown  @xcite that the relation    @xmath14    between the elastic and dissipative force holds , independently on the shape of the bodies in contact , provided three conditions are met  @xcite :    1 .",

    "@xcite , the value of @xmath295 , corresponding to a crossover from the linear regime of evolution ( which refers to the homogeneous cooling state ) to the nonlinear regime ( when clustering starts ) may differ by orders of magnitude , depending on the restitution coefficient and on the density of the granular gas .",

    "given two systems of granular particles at the same density and the same initial temperature @xmath111 , consisting of particles colliding with constant and velocity - dependent restitution coefficient , respectively , the time @xmath297 allows to compare directly their evolution .",
    "a strong argument to use a temperature - based time has been given by goldhirsch and zanetti  @xcite who have shown that as the temperature decays , the evolution of the system changes from a linear regime to a nonlinear one .",
    "recent numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite also support our assumption : it was shown that while @xmath295 differs by more than a factor of three for two different systems , the values of @xmath298 , ( defined , as @xmath299 ) are very close  @xcite .",
    "these arguments show that one could consider @xmath297 as a relevant time - scale to analyze the granular gas evolution .    with the temperature decay @xmath300 for a constant restitution coefficient and @xmath301 for the impact - velocity dependent one ,",

    "thus , we conclude that clustering may be retarded for the latter system .",
    "in conclusion , we considered kinetic properties of granular gases composed of viscoelastic particles , which implies the impact - velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient .",
    "we found that such dependence gives rise to some new effects in granular gas dynamics : ( i ) complicated , non - monotonous time - dependence of the coefficient @xmath135 of the sonine polynomial expansion , which describes the deviation of the velocity distribution from the maxwellian and ( ii ) enhanced spreading of particles , which depends on time as a power law , compared to a logarithmically weak dependence for the systems with a constant @xmath0 .",
