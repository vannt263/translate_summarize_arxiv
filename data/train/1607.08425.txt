    "proceed , the colony grows and spreads laterally along the substrate .",
    "this process may occur in an ambient liquid or under a gas atmosphere .    the widespread occurrence of biofilms and their either detrimental or beneficial effect",
    "imply that it is highly important to understand the physico - chemical and biological principles of biofilm formation and spreading at different types of interfaces .",
    "hence the past decades have seen the development of a variety of theoretical biofilm models . on the one hand , there is a vast literature on the evolution of biofilms on flat solid substrates in contact with a bulk liquid , i.e. , at solid - liquid interfaces ( for reviews see for example @xcite ) .",
    "independent of the type of model used ( continuous , discrete or hybrid ) , the following processes are typically considered : cell attachement / detachment to / from the surface , cell division and cell death , matrix production , nutrients and oxygen uptake by the cell etc .",
    "transport is modeled via diffusion and convection through the liquid phase .",
    "relevant questions , which have been treated are e.g. the effect of cell transport mechanisms @xcite , nutrient concentration @xcite , biofilm matrix properties @xcite , or cell - to - cell signalling @xcite on the biofilm morphology , the interplay between bulk fluid flow and biofilm morphology @xcite , or the evolution of multispecies biofilms @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recently , also biofilms at solid - gas interfaces have attracted some attention as in the laboratory and in nature , biofilms also grow on moist solid substrates in contact with a gas phase . in this case",
    ", the spreading of a biofilm colony involves the motion of the three - phase contact line between the viscous biofilm , the solid substrate and the gas phase . in the contact line region",
    "wetting phenomena are likely to play a major role in the biofilm dynamics .",
    "indeed , it was shown experimentally , that in many cases biofilm spreading is not driven by the active mobility of individual bacteria but rather by growth processes and the physico - chemical properties of the biofilm components and the resulting fluxes @xcite .",
    "one example is a spreading mechanism studied for _ bacillus subtilis _ biofilms which relies on the auto - production of surfactin , which acts as surfactant .",
    "surfactants can promote rapid surface colonisation by altering the interfacial properties @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a local gradient in surfactant concentration results in a surface tension gradient which drives so - called marangoni flows that promote spreading @xcite .",
    "another example for a biofilm spreading mechanism that corresponds to a physico - chemical mechanism is the osmotic spreading .",
    "osmosis describes the transport of solvent across an interface that the solute is not able to pass .",
    "the most emblematic example is that of the transport of water through a semi - permeable membrane from a reservoir with low solute concentration into one with high solute concentration @xcite . for _",
    "bacillus subtilis _ and _ sinorhizobium meliloti _",
    ", the spreading behaviour on moist agar substrates is determined by the ability of the bacteria to produce the exopolysaccharide component of the polymeric matrix @xcite .",
    "the spreading mechanism results from gradients of osmotic pressure that are generated as bacteria consume water and nutrient to produce further biomass .",
    "the resulting osmotic imbalance between biofilm and agar substrate causes the biofilm to swell and spread through an uptake of water from the moist agar substrate .",
    "it was found experimentally , that nutrient depletion within a colony that grows on a nutrient - rich agar substrate in a gas atmosphere triggers an increase in matrix production that allows for a subsequent radial spreading which provides the biofilm with fresh nutrients @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental tracking of the distribution of the main phenotypes of a _ bacillus subtilis _ strain with fluorescence imaging techniques has shown that the matrix producing cells are predominantly located in the outer rim of the biofilm which also suggests that they play a crucial role in the spreading of a biofilm front @xcite .     as outlined above ,",
    "many aspects of the complex biofilm morphology have been modeled extensively with very detailed multidimensional approaches . with our present approach",
    "we are specifically aiming at investigating the role of surface forces , i.e.  capillarity and wettability , on the osmotic spreading of biofilms growing at agar - gas interfaces .",
    "thereby we neglect many aspect of biofilm complexity ( for example specifically modelling the nutrient and oxygen dynamics ) .",
    "instead we start out from the thermodynamic consistent theoretical framework developed for the evolution of films of passive suspensions @xcite , which we supplement by bioactive growth terms representing proliferation / death and matrix production . in the first presentation of this approach",
    "we focus on a simple case , where the biomass is only transported by passive mechanisms , as opposed to active transport via bacterial motility . because the osmotic spreading mechanism of biofilm growth results from physico - chemical processes occurring at the interface between the agar substrate and the biofilm",
    ", we include wetting effects into the model in terms of a derjaguin ( or disjoining ) pressure that is related to a wetting energy .",
    "this approach allows us to consistently describe the advancing biofilm edge and to study how biofilm growth results from the interplay between passive surface forces ( i.e. , wetting energy , surface tension ) , osmotic fluxes between agar and biofilm , and active growth processes .",
    "the following section  [ sec : mm ] presents our model and its numerical treatment .",
    "first , section  [ sec : mod - pass ] introduces the model for the passive case of a free - surface film of a suspension on a solid substrate in a gradient dynamics form .",
    "it describes the spreading film in terms of coupled evolution equations for continuous variables , namely , the effective heights of solute and solvent .",
    "we emphasise that the gradient dynamics form ( i ) allows for an easy and fully consistent extension towards more complex materials incorporating , e.g. , solvent - solute and solute - solute interactions @xcite , ( ii ) directly reflects the principles of non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , and ( iii ) and is fully equivalent to the hydrodynamic form obtained by long - wave approximation that consist of a thin film equation coupled to an advection - diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "the subsequent section  [ sec : mod - act ] introduces the bioactive growth term into the model and the term responsible for the osmotic influx and evaporation of the solvent . from there on , solvent and solute represent nutrient - rich water and biomass ( bacteria and the extracellular polymeric matrix ) , respectively .",
    "our numerical treatment of the model is briefly discussed in section  [ sec : num ] .    section  [ sec : res ] presents selected results obtained with our simplified model .",

    "the final section  [ sec : conc ] presents our conclusion .",

    "furthermore , some parameters as , e.g. , the mobility coefficients for the transfer of water from the agar into the biofilm , are not known .",
    "however , in the following we discuss how to calibrate the relevant scales and dimensionless parameters using the experiments by seminara and coworkers @xcite .",
    "as the biofilm evolution is highly sensitive to the environmental conditions , e.g. , the limiting biofilm height varies between several tens to several hundred @xmath109 m @xcite , the model has to be calibrated separately for each individual experiment .",
    "here we specifically use the experiment in ref .  @xcite .    from the biofilm height of @xmath11030@xmath109 m , the typical time scale for the transition between vertical and horizontal swelling of about 10h and the typical spreading velocity of about 200@xmath109 m @xmath111 we estimate the vertical length scale @xmath112=250 nm , the horizontal length scale @xmath113=20@xmath109 m and the time scale @xmath114=6min . from the measured dynamic contact angle of about 1@xmath115 , together with the estimated length scales we obtain the dimensionless wettability parameter @xmath93 , which is the value we have used for most calculations . a typical dimensionless growth rate constant @xmath92 ( figs .",

    "the estimate for the transfer coefficient of water between the agar substrate and the biofilm is not an easy task , since it crucially depends on the permeability of the agar and the interface thickness . in our simulations",
    "we have assumed that osmotic fluxes are faster than or on the same time scale as biomass growth and therefore the time scale of spreading is dominated by the interplay of biomass growth and surface forces . using the relation for the dimensionless mobility @xmath117 , where @xmath118nm@xmath119 @xcite denotes the permeability of the agar",
    ", @xmath120pas denotes the dynamic viscosity of water and with the size of the solute @xmath121 m we find a range of values for @xmath122 , i.e. , about the range we have studied in fig .",
    "[ figfronts ] .",
    "we have developed a simple model for the osmotic spreading of growing biofilms on the surface of moist agar substrates under air .",
    "to do so we have first laid out that a film of passive ( not bioactive ) mixtures or suspensions can be described by two coupled thin - film equations for the effective layer heights of solvent and solute .",
    "these can either be written in the form of a gradient dynamics on an underlying energy functional as derived in the literature or in the more usual hydrodynamic form of coupled thin film and advection - diffusion equations .",
    "the former way is advantageous as it allows for an easy extension towards more involved interaction and interfacial energies that it incorporates automatically in all relevant transport channels including the osmotic influx and evaporation .",
    "we have then shown that the passive model can serve as a basis for the study of the growth dynamics of biofilms as it can be supplemented by additional terms that account for bioactive processes .",
    "namely , these are proliferation / death processes , production of intercellular polymeric matrix and also the passive osmotic influxes caused by the growth of biomass in the film .",
    "we have derived and discussed a particular , simple model to study the osmotically driven spreading of biofilms which is observed experimentally for certain bacterial strains at moist agar - air interfaces .",
    "the model focuses on the fluid - like character of young biofilms and especially incorporates the wetting behaviour and the fluid flow in a consistent way by introducing a wetting energy ( i.e. , a derjaguin or disjoining pressure ) into the dynamic model . to our knowledge",
    "this has not been done before .     within this framework ,",
    "the biofilm spreads on a stable wetting layer , whereby spreading is driven by biomass production and a resulting osmotic influx from the agar .",
    "this has offered us the opportunity to study the influence of passive material parameters , such as , the wettability of the agar substrate and surface tension of the biofilm - air interface on the spreading behaviour of the biofilm . for the early stage of growth ,",
    "the model reproduces the transition from initial vertical swelling to horizontal spreading . in the long - time limit",
    ", the model shows that biofilms grow laterally by stable stationary growth fronts .",
    "these have been further analysed by applying continuation techniques . in this way",
    ", we were able to characterize the influence of model parameters , such as , the growth rate constant of the bacteria , the wetting properties and the strength of the osmotic influx on the velocity and profile of the fronts .",
    "our results show that our approach results in a qualitatively correct and quantitatively reasonable simple asymptotic model of osmotic biofilm spreading .",
    "it should be seen as a parallel approach to complex multi - scale biofilm models that can normally only be tackled by expensive numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , we plan to incorporate in the future further features of biofilm growth . possible extensions of the model include , for example , the auto - production and dynamics of surfactants in the biofilm which would allow one to study the role of surface tension gradient - driven flows ( marangoni flows ) on the spreading behaviour @xcite .",
    "we assume that biomass is produced in a bimolecular reaction by consuming the nutrient - rich water .",
    "the production of biomass includes the growth of bacteria as well as the production of extracellular matrix .",
    "the time evolution of the concentrations of water @xmath3 and biomass @xmath4 due to this processes is then given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a factor that describes the efficiency of this transformation which describes for example the amount of nutrients that the bacteria need to sustain their metabolism .",
    "for simplicity , we set @xmath125 .",
    "the growth rate constant @xmath26 depends , e.g. , on the nutrient concentration in the agar substrate and the bacterial strain . translating this growth into an evolution for the effective heights of water and biomass yields @xmath126 the growth of bacteria and",
    "the production of extracellular matrix is not unlimited because it is limited by effects as the availability of nutrient and oxygen across the biofilm .",
    "these processes limit the biofilm to a maximal height that corresponds , e.g. , to a balance of nutrient diffusion and consumption @xcite . as it is beyond the scope of this work to model oxygen and nutrient concentration directly ,",
    "we introduce a limiting amount of biomass @xmath74 that can maximally be sustained by the substrate , which depends , e.g. , on the nutrient concentration in the agar .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a factor @xmath127 into the growth term , corresponding to the well known logistic law , that describes a population dynamics which evolves towards a limiting value @xcite .",
    "in addition , we introduce a growth threshold at a small value @xmath128 that is motivated by the fact that at least one bacterial cell is needed for cell division and matrix production .",
    "it is introduced such that it shifts the onset of the logistic growth to this value .",
    "@xmath129 recall that the biofilm coexist with a thin wetting layer of height @xmath55 on the moist agar substrate .",
    "growth of bacteria in the wetting layer away from the biofilm would correspond to the spontaneous creation of new biofilm droplets away from the original biofilm . here",
    "we avoid this by modifying the growth term .",
    "we introduce a stable fixed point at @xmath130 in the growth term , which ensures that no bacterial growth takes place in the wetting layer that shall be in osmotic equilibrium with the agar . the final growth term is then given by @xmath131 please note that the introduction of the growth threshold and the stabilisation of the wetting layer only ammends the growth term at very small amounts of biomass as with increasing @xmath6 , the term @xmath132 fast approaches one . outside the zoom shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the logistic growth law remains practically the same .",
