    "the short wavelength domain of the laser radiation is very prospective for experimental observation and investigation of the dynamical schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "the operating @xmath2-ray laser facilities @xcite are able to generate only very small electric fields in the focal spot with the amplitude @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the schwinger critical field strength",
    ". however , there are perspectives to achieve the schwinger limit in this domain in the nearest future ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present work we investigate the residual electron - positron pair plasma ( eppp ) which is generated from vacuum after the cessation of a high - power laser pulse in the focal spot .",
    "in contrast to the well - known works @xcite , our approach is based on the analysis of a kinetic equation ( ke ) @xcite that is an exact nonperturbative consequence of the basic equations of motion of qed for the case of a linearly polarized time dependent electric field ( `` laser field '' ) .",
    "we limit ourselves to the domain of subcritical fields @xmath5 and to the case of rather short wavelength @xmath6 when the adiabacity parameter @xmath7 is large , @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to the multiphoton mechanism of the eppp excitation ( @xmath8 is the compton wavelength ) . in problems of vacuum particle production ,",
    "one usually studies the characteristics of the out - state , when the external field is switched off .",
    "this is due to the needs of an experiment aimed at finding free real particles .",
    "recently , however , there is a growing interest in the properties of the intermediate states ( mid - states ) , characterized by quasiparticle interactions in the presence of an external field .",
    "this is motivated by the likely role of the elementary reactions of the quasiparticles in the field and their possible experimental manifestations @xcite .    the most complete description of the pair production process for both the mid- and the out - states is given by the momentum distribution function . depending on the shape of the external field the vacuum excitations can form very complex and diverse momentum distributions which are essentially nonequilibrium ones .",
    "the complex form of the pair momentum spectrum should significantly affect the cross sections of elementary reactions and the development of avalanche - like electromagnetic cascades @xcite .",
    "it should also have some observable manifestations .",
    "the most striking difference between the nonequilibrium spectrum of produced particles and the equilibrium one is a significant non - monotonicity of @xmath9 .",
    "this deformation is much more pronounced in the mid - state which is important for elementary reactions and cascades .",
    "this feature has been noticed in the works @xcite for the case of a periodic field , and was later studied more in detail for a gaussian laser pulse in the work @xcite .",
    "the representative oscillations of the momentum distribution with a scale set by the laser frequency received an explanation on the mathematical basis for the stokes phenomenon in the theory of differential equations @xcite .",
    "other manifestations of such effects were studied in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that these remarkable features of the momentum distribution function are not captured by wkb - like approaches @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the only known exact solution for a homogeneous field in the form of a sauter bell generates a smooth spectrum @xcite .",
    "apparently , for the occurrence of nonmonotonic deformations of @xmath9 different scales must be present in the spectrum of the external field .",
    "the actual laser field is required in the spectrum of two different time scales , so that the question of the form @xmath9 is essential for the experiment .    in the framework of using limitations ,",
    "the following main results were obtained by both numerical and analytical approaches :    * the distribution function of the residual eppp has a complicated quasiperiodical character in both the longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) and the transversal ( @xmath11 ) momentum components resulting in a cellular structure in the momentum space ; * the profile function for switching - on ( and switching - off ) the laser signal has a considerable influence on the magnitude and structure of the momentum distribution of the residual eppp ; * together with the usual multiphoton mechanism of the eppp excitations the photon cluster mechanism of absorption of the laser field energy plays an essential role due to the relativistic nature of this system .    in sect .",
