    "the @xmath0-nucleus interaction near threshold is strongly attractive and absorptive as suggested by fits to the strong - interaction shifts and widths of @xmath2-atom levels  @xcite .",
    "global fits yield ` deep ' optical potentials with re  @xmath3 mev  @xcite , whereas more theoretically inclined studies that fit the low - energy @xmath4 reaction data , including the @xmath5 quasi - bound state @xmath6 as input for constructing density dependent optical potentials , suggest relatively ` shallow ' potentials with re  @xmath7 mev  @xcite .",
    "the issue of depth of the attractive @xmath0-nucleus potential is discussed in section [ sec : pot ] .",

    "atomic _ states are expected to exist  @xcite , independently of the size of re  @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kpb ] from ref .",
    "@xcite shows on the left - hand side a calculated spectrum of @xmath2 atomic states in @xmath9pb where , in particular , all the circular states below the @xmath10 state are not populated by x - ray transitions due to the strong @xmath2-nuclear absorption , and on the right - hand side it demonstrates saturation of the @xmath11 atomic - state width as a function of the absorptivity parameter i m  @xmath12 of @xmath8 .",
    "the physics behind is that a strong i m  @xmath8 acts repulsively , suppressing the _ atomic _ wavefunction in the region of overlap with i m  @xmath8 .",
    "the calculated width of the ` deeply bound ' atomic @xmath13 and @xmath11 is less than 2 mev , also confirmed by the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , calling for experimental ingenuity how to form these levels selectively by a non - radiative process  @xcite .",
    "this saturation mechanism does not hold for @xmath0-nuclear states which retain very good overlap with the potential .",
    "hence , the questions to ask are ( i ) whether it is possible at all to bind _ strongly _ @xmath0 mesons in nuclei , and ( ii ) are such quasi - bound states sufficiently narrow to allow observation and identification ?",
    "the first question was answered favorably by nogami  @xcite as early as 1963 arguing that the @xmath14 system could acquire about 10 mev binding in its @xmath15 state .",
    "yamazaki and akaishi , within a single - channel @xmath14 calculation  @xcite , reported a binding energy @xmath16  mev and width @xmath17  mev ; however , the recent coupled - channel @xmath18 faddeev calculation for @xmath14 by shevchenko et  al .",
    "@xcite finds a substantially broader @xmath15 state ( @xmath19  mev , @xmath20  mev ) .",
    "the current experimental and theoretical interest in @xmath0-nuclear bound states was triggered back in 1999 by the suggestion of kishimoto  @xcite to look for such states in the nuclear reaction @xmath21 in flight , and by akaishi and yamazaki  @xcite who suggested to look for a @xmath22 @xmath5 state bound by over 100 mev for which the main @xmath23 decay channel would be kinematically closed . some controversial evidence for relatively narrow states was presented initially in @xmath24 and @xmath25 reactions on @xmath26he ( kek - ps e471 )  @xcite but has just been withdrawn ( kek - ps e549/570 )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-nuclear states were also invoked to explain few weak irregularities in the neutron spectrum of the @xmath27 in - flight reaction on @xmath28o ( bnl - ags , parasite e930  @xcite ) , but subsequent @xmath27 and @xmath21 reactions on @xmath29c at @xmath30  gev / c ( kek - ps e548  @xcite ) have not disclosed any peaks beyond the appreciable strength observed below the @xmath0-nucleus threshold .",
    "ongoing experiments by the finuda spectrometer collaboration at da@xmath31ne , frascati , already claimed evidence for a relatively broad @xmath32 deeply bound state ( @xmath33  mev ) in @xmath34 reactions on li and @xmath29c , by observing back - to - back @xmath35 pairs from the decay @xmath36",
    "@xcite , but these pairs could more naturally arise from conventional absorption processes at rest when final - state interaction is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath37 reaction on @xmath38li has also been recently observed  @xcite .",
    "another recent claim for a very narrow and deep @xmath32 state ( @xmath39  mev , @xmath40  mev ) is also based on observing decay @xmath35 pairs , using @xmath41 annihilation data on @xmath26he from the obelix spectrometer at lear , cern  @xcite .",
    "one can not rule out that the @xmath35 pairs assigned in the above analyses to @xmath14 decay in fact result from nonmesonic decays of different clusters , say the @xmath22 @xmath5 quasi - bound state .",
    "a definitive identification may only be reached through a fully exclusive formation analysis , such as the one scheduled for j - parc  @xcite : @xmath42 finally , preliminary evidence for the @xmath22 @xmath5 state ( @xmath43  mev , @xmath44  mev ) has been recently presented by the finuda collaboration on @xmath38li by observing back - to - back @xmath45 pairs  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the issue of @xmath0 nuclear states is far yet from being experimentally resolved and more dedicated , systematic searches are necessary .",
    "it is interesting then to study theoretically @xmath0 nuclear quasi - bound states in the range of binding energy @xmath46 mev , in particular the width anticipated for such deeply bound states .",
    "this is described in section  [ sec : rmf ] within the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model for a system of nucleons and one @xmath0 meson interacting through the exchange of scalar ( @xmath47 ) and vector ( @xmath48 ) boson fields which are treated in the mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "the born approximation for @xmath8 due to the leading - order tomozawa - weinberg ( tw ) vector term of the chiral effective lagrangian @xcite yields a sizable attraction : @xmath49 for @xmath50 @xmath51 , where @xmath52 mev is the pseudoscalar meson decay constant . iterating the tw term plus next - to - leading - order terms , within an _ in - medium _ coupled - channel approach constrained by the @xmath53 data near the @xmath54 threshold , roughly doubles this @xmath0-nucleus attraction .",
    "it is found ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the @xmath6 quickly dissolves in the nuclear medium at low density , so that the repulsive free - space scattering length @xmath55 , as function of @xmath56 , becomes _ attractive _ well below @xmath57 .",
    "since the attractive @xmath58 @xmath59 is only weakly density dependent , the resulting in - medium @xmath54 isoscalar scattering length @xmath60 ) translates into a strongly attractive @xmath8 : @xmath61 however , when @xmath8 is calculated _ self consistently _ , namely by including @xmath8 in the propagator @xmath62 used in the lippmann - schwinger equation determining @xmath63 , one obtains re  @xmath64  mev  @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this weakening of @xmath8 , approximately back to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiral ] ) , is the strong absorptive effect which @xmath8 exerts within @xmath62 to suppress the higher born terms of the @xmath54 tw potential .",
    "the @xmath2-atom data used in global fits  @xcite span a range of nuclei from @xmath65li to @xmath66u , with 65 level - shift and -width data points . figure [ fig : v ] shows fitted @xmath0-nucleus potentials for @xmath67ni and @xmath9pb , for a @xmath68 potential with a complex strength @xmath69 , and for two density - dependent potentials marked by dd and f , also fitted to the same data . for the real part ,",
    "the depth of the @xmath68 potential is about @xmath70  mev , whereas the density - dependent potentials are considerably deeper , @xmath71  mev .",
    "these latter potentials yield substantially lower @xmath72 values of 103 and 84 , respectively , than the value 129 for the @xmath68 potential .",
    "we note that , although the two density - dependent potentials have very different parameterizations , the resulting potentials are quite similar . in particular , the shape of potential f departs appreciably from @xmath73 for @xmath74 , where the physics of the @xmath6 still plays some role .",
    "the density dependence of the potential f is qualitatively similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trho ] ) , by far providing the best fit ever reported for a global @xmath2-atom data fit .",
    "additional considerations for estimating @xmath8 are listed below .",
    "\\(i ) qcd sum - rule estimates  @xcite for vector ( v ) and scalar ( s ) self - energies : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the strange - quark ( current ) mass .",
    "the factor 1/2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcdv ] ) is due to the one nonstrange antiquark in the @xmath0 out of two possible , and the minus sign is due to @xmath77-parity going from quarks to antiquarks .",
    "this rough estimate gives then @xmath78  mev .",
    "the qcd sum - rule approach essentially refines the mean - field argument  @xcite @xmath79 where the 1/3 factor is again due to the one nonstrange antiquark in the @xmath0 , but here with respect to the three nonstrange quarks of the nucleon .",
    "\\(ii ) the ratio of @xmath80 production cross sections in nucleus - nucleus and proton - nucleus collisions near threshold , measured by the kaon spectrometer ( kaos ) at sis , gsi , gives clear evidence for attractive @xmath8 , estimated  @xcite as @xmath81  mev by relying on buu transport calculations normalized to the value @xmath82  mev .",
    "since the buu calculations apparently disregard @xmath83 absorption , a deeper @xmath8 may follow when nonmesonic absorption is included .",
    "in this model , expanded in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ( anti)kaon interaction with the nuclear medium is incorporated by adding to @xmath84 the lagrangian density @xmath85 : @xmath86 the covariant derivative @xmath87 describes the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the vector meson @xmath88 .",
    "the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the isovector @xmath56 meson was neglected , a good approximation for the light @xmath89 nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0 meson induces additional source terms in the equations of motion for the meson fields @xmath47 and @xmath90 .",
    "it thus affects the scalar @xmath91 and the vector @xmath92 potentials which enter the dirac equation for nucleons , and this leads to rearrangement or polarization of the nuclear core .",
    "furthermore , in the klein - gordon equation satisfied by the @xmath0 , the scalar @xmath93 and the vector @xmath94 potentials become _ state dependent _ through the _ dynamical _ density dependence of the mean - field potentials @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as expected from a rmf calculation .",
    "the @xmath0 potential was made complex by adding @xmath97 in a @xmath68 form fitted to the @xmath2 atomic data  @xcite . from phase - space considerations , @xmath97",
    "was then multiplied by a suppression factor , taking into account the binding energy of the antikaon for the initial decaying state , and assuming two - body final - state kinematics for the decay products in the @xmath98 mesonic modes and in the @xmath99 nonmesonic modes .",
    "the coupled system of equations was solved self - consistently .",
    "to give rough idea , whereas the static calculation gave @xmath100  mev for the @xmath2 @xmath13 state in @xmath29c , using the values @xmath101 corresponding to the @xmath2-atom fit , the dynamical calculation gave @xmath102  mev for this same state . in order to produce different values of binding energies ,",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 were varied in given intervals of physical interest .",
    "beginning approximately with @xmath29c , the following conclusions may be drawn :    \\(i ) for given values of @xmath105 , the @xmath0 binding energy @xmath106 saturates , except for a small increase due to the coulomb energy ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the difference between the binding energies calculated dynamically and statically , @xmath107 , is substantial in light nuclei , increasing with @xmath106 for a given value of @xmath108 , and decreasing monotonically with @xmath108 for a given value of @xmath106 .",
    "it may be neglected only for very heavy nuclei .",
    "the same holds for the nuclear rearrangement energy @xmath109 which is a fraction of @xmath107 .",
    "\\(iii ) the width @xmath110 decreases monotonically with @xmath108 , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ]    which shows calculated widths @xmath111 as function of the binding energy @xmath112 for @xmath13 states in @xmath113c and @xmath114ca , using the nonlinear nl - sh version  @xcite of the rmf model , and in @xmath115pb using the nl - tm1 version  @xcite .",
    "the dotted line shows the static ` nuclear - matter ' limit corresponding to the @xmath2-atom fitted value @xmath116 fm and for @xmath117 @xmath51 , using the same phase - space suppression factor as in the ` dynamical ' calculations .",
    "it is clearly seen that the functional dependence @xmath118 follows the shape of the dotted line .",
    "this dependence is due primarily to the binding - energy dependence of the suppression factor @xmath119 which falls off rapidly until @xmath120  mev , where the dominant @xmath121 gets switched off , and then stays rather flat in the range @xmath122  mev where the width is dominated by the @xmath83 absorption modes .",
    "the widths calculated in this range are considerably larger than given by the dotted line ( except for pb in the range @xmath123  mev ) due to the dynamical nature of the rmf calculation , whereby the nuclear density is increased by the polarization effect of the @xmath2 .",
    "adding perturbatively the residual width neglected in this calculation , partly due to the @xmath124 secondary mesonic decay channel , a representative value for a lower limit @xmath1  mev holds in the binding energy range @xmath122  mev .",
    "figure [ fig : rho ] shows on the left - hand side the calculated average nuclear density @xmath125 as a function of @xmath112 for @xmath2 nuclear @xmath13 states across the periodic table . in the light @xmath2 nuclei , @xmath126 increases substantially with @xmath112 to values about 50% higher than without the @xmath0 .",
    "the increase of the central nuclear densities is even bigger , as demonstrated on the right - hand side for a family of @xmath13 @xmath2 states in @xmath127pb , but is confined to a small region subsiding almost completely by @xmath128  fm , well within the nuclear volume . as a result ,",
    "@xmath129 on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] is only weakly enhanced as function of @xmath112 .",
    "in this talk i reviewed the phenomenological and theoretical evidence for a substantially attractive @xmath0-nucleus interaction potential , from a ` shallow ' potential of depth @xmath130 mev to a ` deep ' potential of depth @xmath71 mev at nuclear - matter density .",
    "i then reported on recent _ dynamical _ calculations  @xcite for deeply quasi - bound @xmath2  nuclear states across the periodic table .",
    "substantial polarization of the core nucleus was found in light nuclei , but the ` high ' densities reached are considerably lower than those found in the few - body calculations due to akaishi , yamazaki and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "an almost universal dependence of @xmath0 widths on the binding energy was found , for a given nucleus , reflecting the phase - space suppression factor on top of the increase provided by the density of the compressed nuclear core .",
    "the present results place a lower limit @xmath1  mev which is particularly useful for @xmath0 binding energies exceeding 100  mev .",
