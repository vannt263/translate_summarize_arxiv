    "until the turn of the century , very few spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies at @xmath10 and above had been identified and fewer still studied in any detail . given that this redshift range covers the first billion years after the big bang , this meant that there was little concrete evidence of how early galaxy formation proceeds . with the advent of deep imaging with 8 m ground - based telescopes , and with the goods and hudf projects carried out with hst ,",
    "it has become possible to photometrically identify distant galaxy candidates and potentially confirm them through spectroscopy .    by extending the lyman break technique @xcite , to @xmath0 using @xmath11 and @xmath12band imaging",
    ", @xcite showed that with the right observational setup it is now possible to securely identify multiple high redshift galaxies in individual 8 m telescope pointings .",
    "these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are identified _ via _ their redshifted uv continuum emission arising from strong unobscured star formation within the systems .",
    "subsequently , similar studies have been carried out by other authors in order to select galaxies with redshifts above @xmath13 @xcite and potentially to @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while some of these studies have included spectroscopic confirmation of samples derived from photometry , many others have not .",
    "these have relied on the high success rate of spectroscopic confirmation in previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* confirmed six of a sample of twelve candidates in a 40 arcmin@xmath1 field to be at @xmath15 ) to argue that photometric selection was reliable enough to carry out statistical studies on photometric samples .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , the reliability and completeness of such samples depends on a complex combination of factors , particularly the filter set and ccd response used to carry out the imaging . in the absence of spectroscopy",
    ", other data is required to help exclude contaminating galactic stars and @xmath16 elliptical galaxies from photometric samples , such as hst and/or deep near - ir ground - based imaging .",
    "one of the main advantages of purely photometric samples is that they can cover a relatively large area of sky in comparison to spectroscopic samples .",
    "however , given the difficulty of obtaining hst and near - ir data of sufficient depth over a large sky area , the use of photometric samples are often compromised .",
    "for this reason , despite the apparent ease of defining a photometric sample , there are distinct advantages in using a sample which has clear spectroscopic evidence of reliability when attempting to understand the statistics and other properties of star forming galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "accurate determinations of their clustering statistics , luminosity functions , star formation histories , stellar population properties and contribution to reionization all require an understanding of the contaminants in the sample being used for the study .",
    "adding to this the need for accurate redshifts in order to carry out many detailed studies of individual high redshift systems , the need for a well - defined photometric sample of @xmath10 lbgs with good spectroscopic follow - up is clear .",
    "@xcite showed that it was possible to obtain ground - based samples of such objects with a reasonable level of spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "however , the study covered a comparatively small area of sky and so could only be used to determine the simplest of statistical properties for such sources . in more recent years",
    "larger areas have been covered by spectroscopic programs e.g. @xcite and @xcite which confirmed 10 and 32 high redshift galaxies respectively .",
    "although these surveys are important to the understanding of the selection of high redshift galaxies and their properties , they often only target the brightest candidates spectroscopically or do not uniformly probe the corresponding photometric sample .",
    "one of the goals of this survey , described here and in future papers , is to observe many high redshift lbg candidates over a range of luminosities and colours to discover if the relatively high completeness seen in previous studies is applicable at fainter magnitudes . although the level of contamination of low redshift lyman break galaxy samples are often very low , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , such a low level can not be assumed for higher redshift samples .",
    "the differences in the selections functions and colours used mean that the two samples are contaminated by completely different galactic and extragalactic populations .    to address this , and other , goals we have carried out a large programme of imaging and spectroscopic observations which cover a sky area fourteen times larger than the original @xcite study including an expanded region of @xmath18 arcmin@xmath1 centered on the original @xcite pointing .",
    "this paper introduces the imaging data sets used to generate a sample of @xmath0 lbg candidates which were followed - up by the same spectroscopic setup used in the original @xcite work .",
    "also it describes a photometric sample of @xmath0 lbg candidates with well - determined reliability and completeness which can be used for statistical study , such as a determination and discussion of the @xmath10 lbg uv luminosity function presented here and a brief comparison of the results of a single @xmath19 colour cut to that of a sample selection with an additional @xmath20 criterion .",
    "the data presented here are drawn from from ten @xmath21 arcmin@xmath1 fields widely - separated on the sky .",
    "observations were carried out as part of an eso large programme , `` the eso remote galaxy survey '' , or ergs ( pi m. bremer , i d 175.a-0706 ) .",
    "this capitalised on existing deep optical imaging of multiple fields already obtained by the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) project @xcite , itself an eso large programme ( pi s. white , i d : 166.a-0162 ) .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic sample of ergs contains many tens of high redshift galaxies with secure redshifts @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : observations ] we discuss the imaging data that was used as a basis for this work and briefly describe follow - up spectroscopic observations . in section [ sec",
    ": select ] and [ sec : select ] we discuss the photometry and how the candidates were selected .",
    "we then discuss the final sample in section [ sec : highz ] and the estimated contamination fraction .",
    "the completeness of this sample is described in section [ sec : completeness ] .",
    "the morphology and observed uv luminosity function for the high redshift lbg candidates is considered in sections [ sec : morph ] and [ sec : nc ]    we adopt the standard @xmath22cdm cosmology , i.e. a flat universe with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "all photometry was determined in the ab magnitude system @xcite .",
    "in order to select a sample of objects containing @xmath0 lbgs all that is needed in principle is sufficiently - deep @xmath26 and @xmath27band imaging .",
    "selecting a flux limited sample in @xmath28 containing objects with an @xmath19 colour redder than a particular value ( usually @xmath2 or @xmath29 ) should identify a sample of @xmath0 lbgs with a completeness that depends on the statistical quality of the data .",
    "however , to _ cleanly _ select a sample of high redshift galaxy candidates without being swamped by contaminating cool galactic stars and lower redshift galaxies , a wide range of multi - band deep imaging is required .",
    "the data set used in this study includes optical imaging using the @xmath30 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath31 bands , near infrared imaging in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 bands and complementary high resolution @xmath28-band imaging from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) of ten widely separated fields each of size @xmath34 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the high galactic latitudes of these fields result in minimal galactic extinction effects and the original selection of the fields to observe @xmath35 clusters produced an effectively random sampling of the sky at @xmath0 , reducing the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "the majority of the imaging data were taken as part of ediscs @xcite , a photometric and spectroscopic survey of galaxy clusters selected from the las campanas distant clusters survey @xcite .",
    "the observing programme involved deep optical imaging using fors2 at the vlt , near - infrared imaging using sofi at the ntt , and high resolution imaging using the acs camera on hst .",
    "the fields were observed with fors2 in the @xmath30 , @xmath26 , and @xmath28 bands for approximately 2 hours each , with a field of view after dithering of @xmath36 . in the near - infrared , the fields",
    "were observed using sofi on the ntt in the @xmath32- and @xmath33-bands for at least 300 and 360 minutes respectively .",
    "the effective field of view of the near ir observations was typically @xmath37 , consequently only around 50 per cent of each optical field was covered .",
    "this ground based imaging was complemented by 80 orbits of hst / acs imaging @xcite .",
    "nine of the ten fields were observed for one orbit over the whole field and an additional four orbits in the central region using the f814w filter , with over 80 per cent of each ground - based optical field being covered by hst data . with typical seeing conditions for the ground based observations between 0.5@xmath38 and 0.8@xmath38 , the 2@xmath39 depth in a 2@xmath38 diameter aperture of each image was typically 28.1 in the @xmath30-band , 27.9 in the @xmath26-band , 27.1 in the @xmath28-band , 24.5 in the @xmath32-band and 23.7 in the @xmath33-band .",
    "details can be found in table [ depth_tab ] .",
    "the depths of the images were calculated by measuring the noise properties of multiple randomly placed 2@xmath38 apertures in background areas of the images .",
    "these images were reduced using standard techniques for bias and bad pixel removal and flat fielding .",
    "the software imcat @xmath40 was used to detect local minima in images smoothed with a 1@xmath38 gaussian to create a catalogue of local sky measurements .",
    "these measurements were then fitted to a bi - cubic polynomial and subtracted from the unsmoothed image .",
    "the images were also aligned with known stars in the usno catalogue to correct for camera distortions and the linear offset between the fields , preserving the surface brightness .",
    "specific details of the data reduction producing the calibrated images used in this study can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ depth_tab ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      due to the shapes of the filter bandpasses and the typical colours of low mass stars , a two colour selection , _",
    "i.e. _ criteria in @xmath19 and @xmath20 colours , is unable to efficiently select high redshift galaxies while eliminating m - type dwarf stars .",
    "given this and the range of @xmath20 colours predicted for high redshift objects , a single @xmath19 criteria was adopted . while the absence of an @xmath20 colour cut may lead to a higher contamination fraction in a purely optically selected sample , the addition of near - ir selection criteria minimise this effect as discussed in section [ sec : select ] .",
    "colour limits when there is no detection in corresponding band.,width=302 ]    the @xmath19 and @xmath20 colours of the spectroscopically observed sources within the photometric sample are shown in figure [ fig:1216riz ] .",
    "the small dots show the range of colours seen in the catalogue of all objects in a single field .",
    "over - plotted are the objects which were spectroscopically confirmed to be at high redshift ( asterisks are galaxies identified using only their continuum break and crosses are galaxies identified with ly@xmath41 line emission ) and confirmed lower redshift galaxies and stars with and without near - ir detections ( triangles and squares respectively ) .",
    "a number of sources , spectroscopically confirmed to be low redshift galaxies or galactic stars , have @xmath20 colours bluer than that expected from the models in figure [ fig : riz ] .",
    "this is most likely caused by a combination of photometric errors and different intrinsic properties of the sources to that assumed in the models .",
    "figure [ fig:1216riz ] illustrates that without the near - ir imaging many low redshift objects would not be distinguishable using only the optical colours .",
    "also , had an @xmath20 colour criteria been applied to eliminate lower redshift contaminants , many high redshift galaxies would have been excluded from the sample .",
    "a variety of @xmath19 and @xmath20 colour cuts could be used to isolate the stellar interlopers from the lbg candidate sample , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath42 . adopting this additional colour cut should , in principle , exclude any stellar interlopers , however for the case of @xmath42 , 36% of the spectroscopically confirmed high redshift sources would be rejected from the sample and only three of the nine spectroscopically confirmed lower redshift interlopers would be removed .",
    "thus , the application of such a colour cut for this combination of filters would significantly reduce the number of high redshift candidates biasing the sample to blue rest - frame uv continuum , while not significantly reducing the relative contamination .",
    "the additional near - ir selection criteria is an effective substitute for an @xmath20 colour cut , removing common interlopers without influencing the high redshift lbg sample .",
    "it is possible that for the optically - fainter objects we fail to reject contaminants because they are too faint to be detected in the near - ir data . at the flux limit of the sample",
    "there is a colour limit of @xmath43 and @xmath44 which does not exclude all possible low redshift contaminants even in the absence of photometric scatter .",
    "lower redshift objects can also scatter into photometric selections through photometric error and extreme colours .",
    "our spectroscopic programme was optimised to maximise the number of spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath10 objects and had sufficient slits to sample robustly all objects which obeyed the optical selection .",
    "consequently we were able to test if a given selection criteria improved the sample .",
    "a third of all photometric candidates with a range of @xmath28-band flux , colours and near - ir detections were observed .",
    "the spectroscopic identifications of this subsample can be used to estimate the fraction of contamination in the refined photometric high redshift sample .",
    "although a spectroscopic identification is harder to achieve for intrinsically fainter objects , figure [ fig : spechist ] shows that our confirmed high redshift lbgs are not biased to brighter @xmath28-band magnitudes and have a distribution similar to that of the refined sample as a whole ( figure [ fig : ihist ] ) . contrary to what would normally be expected , fainter objects can be identified spectroscopically if they have a strong ly@xmath41 emission line or a clear continuum break in a comparatively noise free region of the spectrum .",
    "these features can often make high redshift galaxies easier to identify than lower redshift objects without any emission lines . at low signal - to - noise",
    ", lower redshift objects can show essentially featureless continuum making any redshift determination difficult , if not impossible .",
    "as such , any observed objects which can not be identified in their spectra due to low signal - to - noise , often up to 50% of the observed sample , can not be assumed to lie at high or low redshift ; either scenario is possible .",
    "-band magnitudes for spectroscopically confirmed high redshift galaxies ( solid line ) and lower redshift objects ( galaxies and stars , dashed line ) within the raw photometric sample.,width=302 ]    of the 253 objects in the refined sample , 83 were observed on the spectroscopic masks .",
    "within this subsample 33 objects were confirmed to lie at @xmath45 , 9 were identified as intermediate galaxies or stars and 41 were detected spectroscopically but the signal - to - noise was too low to allocate a firm identification . of the identified objects ,",
    "20% were at a redshift lower than targeted .",
    "using the @xmath46-band imaging , the fraction of high and low redshift objects in the unidentified sample is estimated .    while none of the individually confirmed high redshift galaxies were detected in @xmath46 , by stacking 30 images we determined that their average colour was @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , a typical colour for the confirmed low redshift sources and the unidentified objects was obtained .",
    "the nine confirmed low redshift sources gave colour of @xmath48 . 201 unidentified objects in the refined sample , including those observed spectroscopically but resulted in low signal - to - noise , had an average colour of @xmath49 . where there was no detection in the stacked @xmath46-band image the 2@xmath39 limit for a 2@xmath38 circular aperture",
    "was measured using background regions . given the need for adequate background regions surrounding the central stack to estimate the depth of the image , a small number of sources were not included as they were positioned close to the edge of the near - ir field .",
    "assuming that the unidentified sample is a combination of the high ( @xmath47 ) and low redshift ( @xmath48 ) populations , the typical colours imply the unidentified sample contains at least @xmath5075% high redshift objects and less than @xmath5025% low redshift objects .",
    "combining these results with the spectroscopic identifications gives a contamination fraction of @xmath5020% for the refined sample .",
    "applying the same technique to all optically selected objects including the near - ir detected objects , the contamination fraction is estimated to be around @xmath5040% .",
    "the unidentified near - ir detected sources have an average colour of @xmath51 ( compared with a colour of @xmath52 for the near - ir detected objects confirmed to be at low redshift ) which implies a very high level of interloper within this subsample .",
    "the higher contamination rate estimated for the full sample clearly demonstrates the utility of the near - ir rejection of interlopers in addition to the purely optical selection .",
    "there have been several other spectroscopic studies of @xmath0 lbgs , for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the differences in selection function and filter sets used in these studies makes a direct comparison of the level of contamination difficult .",
    "one feature that all high redshift spectroscopic surveys share is the large fraction of unidentified sources due to insufficient signal - to - noise in the spectroscopy .",
    "this can be up to 50% of the observed sample .",
    "such studies can appear reliable because most or all of the spectroscopically identified objects are at high redshift , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite did not identify any lower redshift objects spectroscopically .",
    "however , care must be taken when assuming the same contamination rates for the spectroscopically unidentified sources and subsequently for the whole photometric sample , especially if only the brightest candidates have been targeted .",
    "although it is difficult to compare contamination fractions of different samples due to different selection , filters and instrument combinations @xcite , it seems that typical contamination rates are between 10% and 20% .",
    "@xcite shows that with contamination fractions of this level , measurements such as the angular correlation function of photometrically - selected lbg samples can be compromised because the expected contaminating population can themselves have a clear correlation signal . also , the difference in optical - to - near - ir colour between contaminants and confirmed high redshift lbgs demonstrated here can also cause problems in estimating the typical multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions of lbgs .",
    "if a population of contaminants individually - undetected in the near - ir are combined in a stacking analysis with true lbgs , they will redden the resulting sed , and artificially inflate the estimated age of the stellar population in a typical lbg or dust fraction .",
    "the completeness of the selection in each field was estimated by carrying out two kinds of simulations .",
    "the first is a simulation of recoverability which depends on the quality and depth of the imaging .",
    "this involved injecting artificial sources with known properties into our photometry data in order to determine the efficiency of sextractor in recovering them .",
    "the second simulation investigated the effects of the selection criteria and image quality on a model spectrum .      for each field ,",
    "300,000 artificial galaxies were generated covering a range of magnitudes from 22.0 to 28.0 and a @xmath19 colour was assigned within the range 0.0 to 3.0 .",
    "a surface brightness profile was chosen from a sample of four stellar profiles measured directly from the images to reflect the seeing conditions ( the high redshift candidates are unresolved in ground - based data ) , and a selection of hst / acs images of two or more galaxies seen at small angular separations selected in the goods data of the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) .",
    "the high resolution multiple systems were convolved with a gaussian profile to match the ground - based seeing conditions and were chosen with the same frequency as seen in the cdfs ( @xmath5020% ) to mimic this population . using the selected magnitude , colour and profile ,",
    "a ` simulated ' galaxy was created for the @xmath28-band and @xmath26-band images and placed at random coordinates within the field excluding previously masked areas near bright objects used in the photometric selection . by placing these galaxies directly onto the science image",
    ", the noise properties of the image were added to the simulated galaxy .",
    "the process was repeated one thousand times for each field as no more than 300 simulated galaxies were placed on any one image to prevent mutual overcrowding affecting the results .",
    "each new image with the simulated galaxies was processed through sextractor in the same way as the original science data , creating catalogues containing the simulated galaxies as observed on the images .",
    "after these were matched with the original galaxy information on magnitude , colour and position , a catalogue was created containing the known simulated magnitudes and the recovered sextractor magnitudes of each fake galaxy .",
    "the high redshift galaxy candidates were selected on two main criteria , a magnitude limit and a colour cut .",
    "the recoverability of the galaxies using the high redshift selection of @xmath3 and @xmath2 was measured for a range of colours and magnitudes and is shown in the contour plots of figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "eight of the ten fields show comparable results , with a completeness of 25% at the @xmath28-band flux limit .",
    "however two fields had consistently lower completeness which was caused by the two worst seeing conditions for the @xmath28-band observations , 0.73@xmath38 compared to an average of 0.6@xmath38 over the other eight fields .",
    "this spread the received flux over a larger area causing the objects to drop below the surface brightness limit . if the objects were detected , the photometry , made fainter by the seeing conditions , is corrected by the appropriate aperture corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows an average of the ten survey fields , with the simulated @xmath28-band magnitude and @xmath19 colour along the x and y axes respectively .",
    "the contours are placed at 20% , 40% , 60% , 80% and 90% of inserted galaxies recovered , using the colour selection of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows that the completeness of object recovery is generally independent of colour with the results reflecting the increasing photometric errors at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the maximum completeness never rises to more than @xmath53 due to object confusion despite areas near bright objects being masked .",
    "-band magnitude of the ` fake ' galaxy inserted into the images and the y - axis is the original colour assigned to this ` fake ' galaxy .",
    "the contours show the percentage recovery rate of these ` fake ' galaxies using the same method as the high redshift selection . it is shown that the completeness of object recovery is generally independent of colour with the results reflecting the increasing photometric errors at fainter magnitudes.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig : comp ] implies that only 60% of galaxies with an intrinsic @xmath19 colour of 1.3 would be included in the sample .",
    "this is not surprising as only @xmath5050% of objects would be expected to be included in the sample at the colour cut .",
    "even a small photometric error in the @xmath26 or @xmath28-band would cause the colour to become too blue .",
    "the applied @xmath19 colour criterion was chosen from the previous work of @xcite who found a colour cut of @xmath29 selects galaxies at @xmath54 using the same fors2 filters used in this work and models from @xcite . by adopting a bluer colour cut , completeness at this selection colour",
    "is much higher .",
    "although this could introduce a higher contamination fraction , the additional near - ir imaging should minimise this .",
    "also , the objects that were recovered with intrinsic colours bluer than our cut represent a population of objects that can contaminate the sample , rather than one that affects the sample completeness .",
    "these objects have their measured colours reddened by the statistical errors on the photometry . at @xmath55 a substantial fraction ( @xmath56 ) of objects with intrinsic @xmath57",
    "can be included in a sample with an observed cut of @xmath2 given the photometric properties of our source data .",
    "such objects are likely to be at @xmath58 and could be a substantial contaminating population depending upon their luminosity function . in reality , such objects would often have significant @xmath30-band flux or near - ir detections which would rule them out of the high redshift candidate sample .",
    "the second simulation determined the completeness of our final sample given the interplay of photometric cuts used to reject contaminants and the statistics of the photometry data , as a function of redshift .",
    "an artificial catalogue of @xmath59 sources was generated with a @xmath28-band magnitude distribution determined by the @xmath6 @xcite luminosity function .",
    "each galaxy was assigned a redshift ( in 0.01 redshift bins ) which determined its @xmath28-band magnitude and @xmath19 colour assuming a flat spectrum in @xmath60 and accounting for igm absorption using the modified madau perscription as a function of redshift ( described in section [ sec : optical ] ) .",
    "the @xmath30- , @xmath26- and @xmath28-band magnitudes of the artificial sources were then independently perturbed to match the typical noise properties of the imaging data and the typical weak lensing characteristics from the foreground clusters . the fraction of objects which were then recovered using the previous @xmath0 selection criteria ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath61 ) as a function of redshift is shown in figure [ fig : frac ] . in total , around 80% of galaxies at @xmath62 are selected using the photometric colour criteria of this work but completeness falls off rapidly below @xmath6 .    , @xmath2 and @xmath61 given the photometric errors of the imaging data .",

    "the luminosity distance , luminosity function and igm absorption were used to determine the apparent magnitude distribution and number density of objects scaled according to the volume within the redshift slice ( per arcmin@xmath1 ) .",
    "the colours of the objects in this redshift bin were calculated according to the fors2 instrumental response and filter profiles assuming the galaxies were flat in @xmath71 and incorporating @xcite igm absorption with a higher density of absorbing systems at high redshift as discussed in section [ sec : optical ] .",
    "the galaxy catalogues for each redshift bin were combined to create a sample with a magnitude , colour and redshift distribution which reflects the proposed luminosity function .    to simulate the properties of the survey fields , each galaxy in the artificial catalogue had colours and magnitudes perturbed by the photometric errors and typical weak lensing correction ( _ e.g. _ if 20% of the survey area was lensed by 0.1 magnitudes , 20% of the catalogue was randomly selected and the model magnitudes were brightened . ) using this artificial catalogue , the galaxy candidates were reselected using the original selection criteria ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath61 ) to produce the predicted magnitude distribution for the ergs survey for the assumed luminosity function with magnitude dependent completeness corrections ( as described in section [ sec : completeness ] ) in addition to the photometric errors , caused by the ergs image quality , and weak lensing corrections .",
    "having repeated this procedure for each combination of luminosity function parameters , the predicted and observed number counts were compared using @xmath72 statistics across the range of m@xmath73 and @xmath41 , allowing the normalisation , @xmath64 to vary .",
    "the resulting best fitting observed luminosity function is shown in figure [ fig : lf ] . as this method does not formally fit @xmath64 , the correction for contamination",
    "is applied to the normalisation after the fitting procedure .     fixed .",
    "@xcite @xmath74 luminosity function applied to @xmath6 assuming no evolution and given the imaging properties and selection of this study is shown by the dashed line .",

    "the errors shown are the poissonian errors of the number of objects in each bin.,width=302 ]     space illustrating the fitting of schechter functions to the observed galaxy number counts .",
    "the contours levels are 90% , 95% probabilities .",
    "with such a faint m * relative to the depth of the sample , the slope of the faint - end , @xmath41 , can not be constrained with this data.,width=302 ]    as figures [ fig : lf ] and [ fig : lfchi ] show , our results for the refined sample , are generally in agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "that result was derived from extremely deep multi - band hst imaging of a comparatively small area .",
    "the fidelity of the data means that it produces an intrinsically cleaner sample with less contamination than typical ground - based studies .",
    "we determined a formal best - fitting m@xmath75 at 1500 , 0.3 magnitudes fainter than that found by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for additional space and ground - based studies ) with @xmath76 .",
    "given that the best - fitting m@xmath73 falls into one of the faintest bins used for model fitting , the data set in this paper can not constrain the faint end slope ( figure [ fig : lfchi ] ) . when @xmath41 was set",
    "to -1.6 the @xmath72 best fitting characteristic magnitude was m@xmath77 and @xmath78 mpc@xmath79 agreeing , within the errors , with previous studies . as we are observing @xmath6 lbgs using an @xmath28-band filter at 7680",
    "the measured luminosity function is at 1250  compared to 1600  luminosity function in @xcite .",
    "such a difference in wavelength would result in different luminosity function parameters at lower redshift , due to the spectral slope of the source . as high redshift lbgs have relatively flat continuum , particularly between 1250  and 1600changes in the luminosity function parameters",
    "are expect to be small .",
    "assuming the luminosity function fitted to the refined sample defines the shape of the relationship , the normalisation , as defined by @xmath64 , can be adjusted to include the reliability of this sample ( @xmath5080% , see section [ sec : contamfrac ] ) .",
    "the adjusted normalisation gives @xmath80 mpc@xmath79 where the fraction of objects at high redshift is assumed to be constant with apparent magnitude .",
    "however , figure [ fig : ihist ] suggests that contamination is a more significant problem at brighter magnitudes with a high fraction of lower redshift objects compared to high redshift candidates .",
    "a magnitude dependant contamination correction , with a larger correction in the brightest bins , would change the shape of the luminosity function leading to a fainter m@xmath73 . even with the extensive spectroscopic followup carried out in the ergs project ,",
    "the number of confirmed high redshift galaxies is not sufficient to study the reliability of the photometric sample as a function of apparent magnitude .    for consistency with other work",
    ", we have used a @xcite luminosity function form for fitting .",
    "we note that the suitability of an analytic form derived from the expected form of galaxy mass functions is questionable for these intense starburst events .",
    "the uv emission arising from these lbgs is highly stochastic , tracing as it does short lived intense star formation events .",
    "the characteristic timescale for these is @xmath81myr @xcite in comparison to a survey window of 250 myr , _",
    "i.e. _ the measured uv luminosity function is only capturing a fraction of the overall lbg population .",
    "the uv luminosity function is therefore likely to be weakly related to mass distribution of star forming galaxies at these redshifts and therefore there is little _ a priori _ reason to expect it to follow a schechter function . indeed , it is plausible that the uv luminosity function is shaped by the time - dependent decay of uv emission from these short - lived starbursts , in effect the shape of the luminosity function mirrors the uv emission ( and therefore star formation ) history of a typical @xmath10 lbg starburst .",
    "although our data can be fit by a schechter function , it can be equally well fit by a simple power - law , n(l)@xmath82l@xmath83 .",
    "the main issue associated with determining the detailed uv luminosity function from bright to faint magnitudes at this redshift is the limited volume probed to the faintest levels .",
    "this necessitates combining together the number counts from at least two separate samples covering the bright and faint ends of the function .",
    "as these come from different volumes , the normalisation of the two ends can vary due to field - to - field variation caused by cosmic variance , or by magnitude - dependent contamination levels within the samples .",
    "indeed , an intrinsic power law extending from bright to faint levels could manifest an apparent break if the bright and faint regimes were determined from separate samples and the bright subsample was normalised high due to cosmic variance or a higher level of magnitude - dependent contamination .",
    "@xcite claimed that the number of @xmath17 sources , selected in a similar manner to this work , was less than that expected from the @xmath8 luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( about 1/3 the number of sources for @xmath3 ) , assuming no evolution between the epochs .",
    "although their data was taken with the same instrument as used in this work , their conclusion was drawn from only 10% of the sky area of this survey .",
    "nevertheless , our average number counts over 10 fields also implies a similar lack of bright sources compared to that expected if there was no evolution in the luminosity function between @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : lf ] compares the observed galaxy number counts ( crosses ) with that predicted using @xcite @xmath8 luminosity function down to @xmath7 .",
    "it can be seen that the observed number counts are a factor of @xmath503 less than would be expected if there is no evolution in the luminosity function between @xmath0 and @xmath74 , a deficit which increases with luminosity .",
    "although the epoch of reionization has ended by @xmath0 , the universe still requires a sufficient density of uv photons to counteract the process of recombination and keep the hydrogen ionised . even without the removal of contaminants ,",
    "there is a lack of galaxies providing ionising photons at these magnitudes .    the equation for the density of star - formation required for reionization from @xcite , modified to the cosmology assumed in this study ,",
    "was used to estimate the star - formation density required to maintain the ionisation state of hydrogen at a redshift of 5.1 , the mean redshift of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies within the photometric sample .",
    "the concentration factor of hydrogen was assumed to be 30 and the photon escape fraction used was @xmath84 @xcite , however these values are not well constrained and can vary largely .",
    "the total luminosity of the sample was found by converting all apparent magnitudes assuming the mean redshift of the confirmed high redshift galaxies within the sample for all objects .",
    "this was then converted to a star - formation rate using the relation given in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the star - formation density of the refined sample is a factor of @xmath504 lower than that necessary to maintain the ionisation of hydrogen at redshift @xmath505 .",
    "even when the whole photometric sample is used , without the removal of likely contaminants , the star - formation density is still nearly 3 times lower than required .",
    "these results imply that the majority of ionising photons originated from fainter sources below the observed flux limit , ( @xmath85 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even after the universe has fully reionized .",
    "another potential source of ionising photons are agn .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the density of agn at these redshifts is very low and as such can not be a large contributor to the overall photon budget of the universe at these redshifts .",
    "through a photometric colour selection we have produced a sample of 253 high redshift lyman break galaxy candidates at @xmath0 drawn from 10 widely - separated fields with @xmath86 photometry covering 275 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "using simulations and a comparatively large programme of follow - up spectroscopy we have been able to determine the completeness and reliability of the sample .",
    "the sample of 253 sources is approximately 80 per cent reliable ( _ i.e. _ has a @xmath87 per cent contamination rate ) .",
    "even with multiple photometric bands used to select objects , the relatively extreme colours of dropout galaxies make them vulnerable to systematic effects in photometry of individual objects .",
    "consequently , statistical results derived from large samples of photometrically - selected objects may well be prone to bias or error because of contamination within the samples . as has been pointed out elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contamination rates of only 15 per cent can significantly skew some statistical results .",
    "a large fraction of these galaxies have multiple components on scales probed by hst imaging .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the components are separate galaxies , or uv luminous regions embedded in a larger , darker underlying galaxy but deeper hudf studies suggest we are observing multiple galaxy systems .",
    "previous work has shown that lbgs appear to decrease in linear size with increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "this applies to individual components of multiple systems , but clearly not necessarily the systems themselves .",
    "contamination is a potentially serious issue in constraining the @xmath10 luminosity function . having taken into account our detailed reliability analysis , we confirm a decline of a factor of @xmath88 in the bright end of the luminosity function ( to @xmath7 ) from @xmath8 to @xmath6 .",
    "assuming a schechter fit to the uv luminosity function at @xmath0 , we obtain values for @xmath89 and @xmath90 mpc@xmath79 ( with a magnitude independent correction for completeness ) , in agreement with @xcite and others .",
    "however , we question the basis for the use of a schechter function .",
    "this is a proxy for a mass function , whereas the uv luminosity of lbgs arises from highly stochastic , short - lived starburst phases and should not necessarily correlate with the mass of the underlying system .",
