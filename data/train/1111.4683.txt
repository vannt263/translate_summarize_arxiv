    "the semileptonic @xmath2 meson transitions to the orbitally excited charmed mesons as well as the strong transitions of the excited charmed mesons into the other charmed states have been in focus of attention of many collaborations in the recent years .",
    "the babar and belle collaborations reported the measurement of the products / ratios of the branching fractions of some semileptonic and hadronic decays of the @xmath2 meson and orbitally excited charmed meson channels @xcite . considering these experimental progress and the fact that the decay channels containing orbitally excited charmed meson in the final state supply a considerable contribution to the total semileptonic @xmath2 meson decay width , more knowledge about the properties of orbitally excited charmed mesons like @xmath0 is needed both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "in the present letter , we calculate the mass and meson - current coupling constant of the @xmath0 tensor meson with quantum numbers @xmath3 in the framework of the qcd sum rules as one of the most applicable and powerful non - perturbative approaches to hadron physics . for details about the method and some of its applications see for instance @xcite .",
    "our results on the mass and meson - current coupling constant of @xmath0 tensor meson can be used in theoretical calculations on the decays of heavy mesons into orbitally excited charmed @xmath0 meson .",
    "moreover , they may be used to analyze the electromagnetic , semileptonic and strong decay modes of the @xmath0 into other charmed and lighter mesons ( for some decay modes of @xmath0 tensor meson and decay modes of heavy mesons into this state see @xcite ) . some properties such as mass ,",
    "meson - current coupling constant and electromagnetic multi - poles of the heavy - heavy , light - heavy and light - light tensor mesons have previously calculated using different frameworks .",
    "for some of them see @xcite and references therein .",
    "some semileptonic decays of the @xmath2 meson into the orbitally excited charmed mesons have also been studied in @xcite within the framework of constituent quark model .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly present calculations of the mass and meson - current coupling constant of the @xmath0 tensor meson within the framework of the qcd sum rules .",
    "section iii is devoted to the numerical analysis of the considered observables as well as comparison of our result on mass with experimental data .",
    "this section is dedicated to calculation of the mass and meson - current coupling constant of the @xmath0 tensor meson in the framework of the qcd sum rules .",
    "the starting point is to consider the following two - point correlation function : @xmath4\\mid   0{\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath5 is the interpolating current of the @xmath0 tensor meson and @xmath6 is the time ordering operator .",

    "the aforementioned correlation function is calculated via two alternative ways : phenomenologically ( physical side ) and theoretically ( qcd side ) .",
    "in physical side , the two - point correlation function is calculated in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom like mass , meson - current coupling constant , etc . the qcd side is obtained in terms of the qcd parameters such as quark masses , quark and gluon condensates , etc . the two - point qcd sum rules is obtained matching coefficients of the same structure representing the tensor mesons from both sides through a dispersion relation and quark - hadron duality assumption .",
    "finally , we apply borel transformation to stamp down the contributions belong to the higher states and continuum .      in the physical side , the correlation function",
    "is obtained inserting complete set of hadronic state having the same quantum numbers as the interpolating current @xmath5 into eq .",
    "( [ correl.func.101 ] ) .",
    "after performing integral over four - x and putting @xmath16 , we obtain the physical side of correlation function as following form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents contribution of the higher states and continuum . to proceed , we need to know the matrix element @xmath19 , which is defined in terms of the meson - current coupling constant , mass and polarization tensor @xmath20 combining eq .",

    "( [ lep ] ) and performing summation over polarization tensor via @xmath21 with , @xmath22 the final representation of physical side is obtained as @xmath23 where , the explicitly written structure gives contribution to the tensor state .",
    "the correlation function in qcd side , is calculated in deep euclidean region , @xmath24 , by the help of operator product expansion ( ope ) where the short and long distance contributions are separated .",
    "the short distance effects are calculated using the perturbation theory , while the long distance effects are parameterized in terms of quark and gluon condensates .",
    "any coefficient of the structure , @xmath25 , in qcd side , i.e. @xmath26 , can be written as a dispersion relation @xmath27 where the spectral density is given by the imaginary part of the @xmath26 function , i.e. , @xmath28 $ ] . as we mentioned above , the correlation function contains both perturbative and non - perturbative effects , hence the spectral density can be decomposed as @xmath29 where , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the contributions coming from perturbative and non - perturbative effects , respectively .",

    "( [ rhomatching ] ) , we obtain the following sum rule for the mass of the @xmath0 tensor meson : @xmath52",
    "in this section , we carry out numerical analysis of the sum rules for the mass and meson - current coupling constant of the @xmath0 tensor meson .",
    "the input parameters are taken to be @xmath53 @xcite , @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 @xcite .",

    "the physical quantities should be independent of these parameters , hence we shall look for working regions for these parameters such that the mass and meson - current coupling constant of the @xmath0 tensor meson weakly depend on these helping parameters .",
    "the continuum threshold @xmath56 is not totally arbitrary and it is in correlation with the energy of the first exited state . since we have no experimental information on the first excited state of the meson under consideration , comparing to the other charmed mesons with similar mass we choose the interval @xmath57 for the continuum threshold ( for more information see @xcite ) .",
    "this interval is obtained from @xmath58 and our numerical calculations show that in this region , the results of physical observables very weakly depend on the continuum threshold .    the working region for the borel mass parameter",
    "is determined requiring that not only the higher state and continuum contributions are suppressed but also the contributions of the higher order operators are ignorable , i.e. the sum rules are convergent . as a result , the working region for the borel parameter is found to be @xmath59 . to show how the ope is convergent and the contributions of the higher states and continuum",
