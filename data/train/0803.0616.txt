    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) at the foci of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt ) on board the suzaku observatory are best suited in the recent x - ray astronomy satellites such as asca ( @xcite ) , chandra ( @xcite ) , and xmm ( @xcite ) for diffuse and low surface brightness sources owing to their large collection area and low and stable background level .",
    "one of the xis , xis1 , has a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd , while the other three xis , xis0 , 2 , 3 , are equipped with front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds ( hereafter referred to as xis - fis ; @xcite ) .",
    "the background levels normalized by the effective area and the field of view ( fov ) , in terms of the s / n ratio to diffuse emissions , of the xis - fis are comparable to those of the asca sis ( @xcite ) . moreover , these background levels are @xmath0 and @xmath1 times lower than those of the xmm epic and the chandra acis at 5kev , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the background of the xis consists of three components : ( 1 ) non - x - ray background ( nxb ) ; ( 2 ) a solar component , which is emission from the earth s atmosphere illuminated by the sun and solar wind charge exchange ; and ( 3 ) a diffuse x - ray component from such sources a local hot bubble ( lhb ) , galactic diffuse x - ray emissions , and cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "while the x - ray background is produced by emission within the xrt fov , the xis nxb is caused by charged particles and @xmath2-rays ( mizuno et al .",
    "2004 ) entering the detector from various directions .",
    "therefore , the nxb varies with time according to the radiation environment of the satellite , i.e. the particle or @xmath2-ray spectra hitting on suzaku .",
    "since the altitude of orbit of suzaku is lower than that of xmm or chandra , the particle and @xmath2-ray spectra of suzaku are different from that of xmm or chandra . although these spectra are not entirely clear , their intensities of suzaku are relatively lower and more stable than those of xmm or chandra . in the case of xmm",
    "epic , solar soft protons produce flares of up to 10 times of the quiescent background level and affect 30 - 40% of xmm observation time ( carter et al .",
    "however , this component hardly affects suzaku .",
    "the solar component ( 2 ) includes the fluorescence lines of nitrogen and oxygen from the earth atmosphere and scattered solar x - rays .",
    "the intensity of the solar component depends both on the solar activity and on the elevation angle from the sunlit earth edge .",
    "this component can be minimized by filtering the data based on the elevation angle from the sunlit earth edge .",
    "emission lines of nitrogen and oxygen are enhanced through charge exchange between interplanetary and geocoronal neutral atoms and metal ions in the solar wind ( @xcite ) . referring to the solar wind data , proton or x - ray fluxes",
    ", helps the evaluation of this component .",
    "the spectrum of the cxb is approximated a power - law spectrum of photon index of @xmath3 in 2 - 10kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cxb is known to be a collection of faint unresolved extragalactic sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is uniform over the sky with some fluctuation .",
    "the lhb and galactic diffuse x - ray emissions are dominant below 1kev , and their spectra depend on the direction of the sky .",
    "snowden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed a model which provides their spectra based on the rosat all sky survey .    among the three components of the xis background ,",
    "the solar component is time variable and most difficult to model .",
    "we try to minimize it by using the orbital and altitude data , which are elevation angles from the day or night earth edge , and the solar wind data .",
    "the diffuse x - ray component is basically stable and can be evaluated by observation of other fields by suzaku .",
    "the target of this paper is to properly estimate the nxb so that we can use it as a background model .",
    "it is most important to establish a method to accurately evaluate the nxb spectra and time variations in order to maximize the advantage of the low background level of the xis .",
    "we thus construct an xis nxb database to be used in the evaluation of the nxb and introduce a method to generate the nxb model given the intensity of charged particles .",
    "we also examine and confirm the reproducibility of our nxb model .",
    "we constructed the database of the xis nxb from the events collected while suzaku was pointed toward the night earth ( nte ) . under this condition , the diffuse x - ray component ( 3 ) is blocked , and the solar component ( 2 ) does not contaminate .",
    "the criteria with which we selected the nte events are as follows .    * rev0.7 products ( @xcite ) of which the xis mode was normal @xmath4 or @xmath5 mode ( without burst or window options ) .",
    "the events were further filtered with the condition of @xmath6s , where t_saa_hxd means time after the passage of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "this criterion is used in revision 1.2 or 1.3 products ( @xcite ) , and this filtering excludes flares in the nxb intensity just after suzaku passed through the saa .",
    "the events during the telemetry saturation were also excluded .",
    "* _ cleansis _ in ftools was applied with the default parameters to exclude the flickering pixels . *",
    "the nte events were extracted for earth elevation angles ( elv ) less than @xmath7 and earth day - time elevation angles ( dye_elv ) greater than @xmath8 .",
    "since the xis was in initial operation during august 2005 , we collected the nte events from data observed between september 2005 and may 2006 with the above criteria .",

    "the subject of this paper is to generate the most appropriate nxb spectra for a given observation .",

    "the xis0 has relatively strong mn - k emission lines at 5.9 and 6.5kev as shown in table [ lines ] .",
    "this is due to stray x - rays from the @xmath14fe calibration source , although why the radiation is detected outside the calibration source regions remains unknown ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the xis - fis have a thick neutral layer beneath the depletion layer , most of the background events generated by charged particles produce charge over many pixels and are rejected as asca grade 7 events pixels .",

    "first , since the intensity of the nxb is not uniform over the ccd chip ( @xcite ) , the nxb spectrum needs to be extracted from the same region as the source spectrum in detector ( det ) coordinates ( @xcite ) . we can extract the nxb spectra sorted by the cut - off - rigidity for a given region defined in the det coordinate with the _ mk_corsorted_spec _ ( same applies to the _ mk_corsorted_spec_v1.0.pl _ ) .",

    "the summed - up spectrum is the nxb model to be subtracted from on - source spectra .",
    "one of the problems in this procedure is the presence of emission line components in the nxb spectra .",
    "these components are time - dependent ; the energy resolution of the xis degrades with time ( @xcite ) , and the intensities of the mn - k emission lines decrease with the half life of @xmath14fe , 2.73 years . since the nxb data contained in the nxb database are made from the nxb events between september 2005 and may 2006 and this time dependence is not taken into account , the emission line components in the nxb spectra can not be reproduced correctly for a given on - source observation .",
    "this problem becomes prominent for the observations after june 2006 .",
    "figure [ spec_comp ] shows an example of a raw on - source spectrum and the nxb model spectrum which we have described above .",
    "these are the averaged spectra of the xis - fis .",
    "figure [ spec_bef](a ) shows the on - source spectrum from which the nxb model spectrum is subtracted , black minus red line shown in fig .",

    "the model in fig .",

    "the line components mn - k@xmath17 , mn - k@xmath33 , ni - k@xmath17 , ni - k@xmath33 , and au - l@xmath17 , in the nxb model spectrum are fitted with the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) for august 2005 observations , at which point the degradation of the energy resolution was negligible .",
    "for example , in the energy range of 5.5 - 7.0kev where there are mn - k@xmath17 and mn - k@xmath33 lines , the spectrum is fitted with two gaussians plus a power - law continuum .",
    "we have set the line widths of the two gaussian components as free parameters .",
    "the emission lines of ni - k@xmath17 , ni - k@xmath33 , and au - l@xmath17 are similarly fitted .",
    "we simulate the spectrum of the five gaussian components using the _ fakeit _ command in xspec , using the fitting parameters determined in step 2 .",
    "the spectrum created in the step 3 is subtracted from the nxb model spectrum from step 1 .",
    "this should correspond to the nxb continuum spectrum from which the five gaussian line components are removed .",
    "we add the simulated line components to the nxb continuum spectrum created in step 4 , using the _ fakeit _ command .",
    "to take into account the degradation of energy resolution , this simulation needs to be done with the rmf calculated for the epoch of the on - source observation by using the _ xisrmfgen _ command in ftools .",
    "_ xisrmfgen _ is a response generator for the suzaku xis .",
    "the normalizations and line center energies of the five gaussian components are fixed with those obtained in step 2 , though radioactive decay of @xmath14fe is taken into account .",
    "the intrinsic widths of these lines are fixed to be zero .",
