    "metal - poor environments such as those in low - mass dwarf galaxies and the outskirts of normal spiral galaxies are chemically similar to the star - forming environments of the early universe . improving our understanding of these environments will help shed light on some of the processes that drive star formation in the early universe .",
    "it is clear that heavy elements help cool interstellar gas to initiate its eventual collapse into potential star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "how does star formation proceed without the presence of heavy elements ?",
    "does star formation require large concentrations of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath9 ) , or is this molecule just a byproduct of the star formation process at low metallicity ?    in a solar metallicity environment like that of the milky way , molecular hydrogen easily forms on the available dust grains .",
    "directly observing the h@xmath9  gas that will form stars is problematic since h@xmath9  does not radiate at temperatures below a few hundred kelvin , while stars form inside cold molecular clouds with temperatures of a few tens of kelvin .",
    "fortunately , co forms in conditions similar to h@xmath9 , and the luminosity of co ( l@xmath5 ) is correlated to the total mass of h@xmath9  ( m@xmath10 ; @xcite ; also see the recent review by @xcite and references within ) .",
    "while the conversion factor between l@xmath5  and m@xmath10  is fairly well established in normal galaxy disks with metallicity approximately equal to the solar value , it is much less certain at low metallicities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at low",
    "metallicity , dust is much less abundant ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dust on which h@xmath9  forms also plays a critical role in the shielding of the molecular gas from photodissociation by uv photons .",
    "the lower dust abundances also lengthen the time for h@xmath9  to reach chemical equilibrium by up to 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether atomic gas clouds can form stars in the absence of a significant molecular component .",
    "it is likely that for modest changes in metallicity from a solar abundance this is not a problem since [ ] can provide most of the needed cooling @xcite , and during collapse , the increase in density drives much of the gas into the molecular phase @xcite .    there has been extensive effort aimed at both observing and modelling these low metallicity environments .",
    "@xcite observed the co emission in 11 nearby , low metallicity dwarf galaxies and found a striking dropoff of detections around an oxygen abundance of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath11 8.0 .",
    "this same limit was seen by @xcite in 16 dwarf galaxies from the heracles survey @xcite .",
    "the lack of co detections at 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath11 8.0 could indicate the complete absence of co or it could point to our limited technological ability to recover the low surface brightness emission .",
    "the recent detection of co emission in wlm ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.8 ) by @xcite and marginal detection of co in sextans  a by @xcite both using the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ; @xcite ) suggests the latter .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the abundance of co drops as the metallicity decreases .",
    "simulations of star formation at low metallicity have shown that molecular hydrogen may form and become abundant prior to any co formation , even forming in gas with no dust or heavy elements ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we aim to place further constraints on the state of the molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) at low metallicity in relation to the star formation activity by observing the co ( j = 1 @xmath0 0 ) emission line in three nearby , low - metallicity , star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "we describe our observations in  2 and our galaxy sample in  3 .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 , compare our galaxy sample to those in the literature in  5 , and summarize our findings in  6 .",
    "we observed the co ( j = 1 @xmath0 0 ) 115.27120 ghz emission line in three extremely metal - poor galaxies ( leo  p , sextans  a , and sextans  b ) with the combined array for millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) in the d - configuration . because the carma primary beam ( @xmath21 arcmin ) covered the majority of the star forming disk in leo p , it was observed with a single pointing for a total of 24 hours between 11 february 2013 and 16 february 2013 .",
    "a seven - pointing mosaic was used to observe portions of sextans  a ( 17 total hours between 2 - 15 june 2013 ) and sextans  b ( 11 total hours between 28 march 2013 and 2 april 2013 ) that contained recent star formation activity as well as dense , potentially cold  gas @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows optical images of each galaxy .",
    "the contours represent the h i column density and the red circles denote the field of view of our carma observations in each galaxy .",
    "the correlator was set up to provide native channel widths of 2 km s@xmath8  ( 0.78 mhz ) for each galaxy .",
    "standard reduction procedures were followed using the miriad software package .",
    "baseline and rest frequency corrections were applied , high - amplitude data were flagged , and the sources were calibrated against flux ( 3c273 ) and phase ( 0854 + 201 , 1058 + 015 ) calibrators .",
    "the final data cubes have a natural weighted beam size of 3.5@xmath122.5and a velocity range of 600 km s@xmath8  centered near the velocity at which  emission was detected for each galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . table [ galprops ] lists relevant galaxy properties .",
    "in addition to each of the above spectral line observations , we placed the 12 remaining carma spectral windows to observe the continuum emission .",
    "each of these spectral win- dows covers a 500 mhz bandwidth ( 6 ghz total ) .",
    "similar reduction procedures as above were performed on the continuum data .",
    "the entire 6 ghz bandwidth was then combined into a single image for later analysis .",
    "we complement our co analysis with jansky very large array  emission line observations from two other studies : @xcite ( leo  p ) and @xcite ( sextans  a and sextans  b ) .",
    "we refer the reader to these manuscripts for full data reduction and processing steps .",
    "we utilize these natural weighted data sets to guide our search for co emission as we expect the co emission to overlap in frequency with the observed . in  [ h2mass ] we use the  data to estimate the amount of h@xmath9  for comparison to that computed from our co observations .",
    "we observed three nearby galaxies that show recent signs of star formation , suggesting that some amount of molecular gas is likely to be present .",
    "leo  p is a recently discovered , extremely low - mass galaxy identified by the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey @xcite .",
    "initial estimates for leo  p placed it at a distance between 1.5 and 2.0 mpc @xcite , while deep large binocular telescope imaging refined the distance determination to 1.62 mpc @xcite . at this distance ,",
    "leo  p has a total  mass of only 8.1@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath14 @xcite . despite its low gas content",
    ", leo  p is currently forming stars as evidenced by a young , blue stellar population as well as a single bright  region @xcite .",
    "there also exists evidence of a cold  ( t@xmath111000 k ) gas phase near this lone  region @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of the bright  region put a firm constraint on the oxygen abundance ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.17@xmath150.04 ; @xcite ) , establishing leo  p as one of the lowest metallicity gas - rich galaxies ever measured .",
    "since leo  p was discovered recently , no spitzer or herschel observations exist .    at distances of @xmath21.4 mpc @xcite ,",
    "sextans  a and sextans  b are both well - studied systems .",
    "each has a metallicity of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath16 7.55 @xcite and high column density  reservoirs ( @xcite ) .",
    "their  disks show evidence of cold  gas ( t @xmath11 1500 k ; @xcite ) , as well as co - spatial dust emission from spitzer imaging @xcite . following the methods used in herrera - camus et al .",
    "( 2012 ; specifically , a modified blackbody model with an emissivity index @xmath17=1.5 and a mass absorption coefficient of @xmath18@xmath19 = 9.5 @xmath20 g@xmath8 ) , the @xcite spitzer fluxes imply dust masses of @xmath21.1@xmath1210@xmath21 m@xmath14 and @xmath2240 m@xmath14 for sextansa and sextansb , respectively .",
    "this dust mass for sextans a can be compared to the @xmath2770 m@xmath22 derived from herschel observations in @xcite .    despite the  richness and ongoing star formation of our sample galaxies , to date",
    "no co emission has been found in sextans b or in leop ; a weak co detection in sextansa was reported in @xcite and is discussed further below . in figure [ galfig ]",
    "we show our half - power carma field - of - view ( red circles ) overlaid onto optical ( column a ) , h@xmath23 ( column b ) , and integrated  intensity ( column c ) images for leo  p ( top row ) , sextans  a ( middle row ) , and sextans  b ( bottom row ) .",
    "our carma observations cover areas with recent star formation and high - column density  emission .",
    "visual inspection of the final data cubes at 2 km s@xmath8  velocity resolution ( see figure [ galspec ] ) revealed no significant co emission in any of the three galaxies near the expected velocity ranges defined by the velocity ranges observed in .",
    "thus , in order to report the upper limits of any co emission , we follow a similar approach as @xcite , who presented high - sensitivity measurements of the co emission from the extremely metal - poor galaxy i zw 18 .",
    "first , we smooth the data to a velocity resolution of 18.4 km s@xmath8 , a typical linewidth observed in other nearby , low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then adopt an upper limit to the co intensity ( s@xmath5 ) of four times the average rms level in each channel over the observed  velocity range multiplied by the velocity resolution . to compute an upper limit to the luminosity of co emission ( l@xmath5 ) we use the equation l@xmath5",
    "= 2453@xmath12s@xmath24d@xmath25 where l@xmath5  has units of k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26 , s@xmath5 in units of jy beam@xmath8 km s@xmath8 , and d@xmath27 is the distance in mpc .",
    "table [ obsprops ] lists the derived upper limits for each galaxy .",
    "our upper limits of the co emission represent some of the most sensitive to date at the respective metallicities of each galaxy .",
    "previous co observations of the paradigm metal - poor galaxy i  zw  18 ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.17 ; @xcite ) by @xcite and @xcite yield an upper limit to the co luminosity of l@xmath5  @xmath28 10@xmath13 k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26 .",
    "our limit to the co luminosity in leo  p , which has a similar metallicity to i  zw  18 but is @xmath210 times closer , is @xmath230 times more sensitive .",
    "recently , @xcite observed a small region in sextans  a ( which is included in our observed region ) and claims a marginal 3.4@xmath4 co detection resulting in an l@xmath5 lower limit of 3670 k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26 .",
    "we discuss the implications of these limits below .",
    "the 3 mm continuum emission in normal galaxies is dominated by free - free emission from  regions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our observations are not sensitive enough to detect this emission in our target regions even though h@xmath23 emission exists in each region ( see figure [ galfig ] ) .",
    "we report here our upper limits as 4 times the rms level .",
    "the 3 mm continuum has an upper limit of 0.3 mjy for leo  p , 0.7 mjy for sextans  a , and 1.0 mjy for sextans  b.",
    "it is useful to compare our co observations to measurements of other nearby systems in the literature . in figure [ lcomet ]",
    "we plot the co luminosity versus the oxygen abundance for a sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "black crosses are derived from the sample of galaxies reported by @xcite and references therein .",
    "we have converted the co ( j = 2 @xmath0 1 ) observations in @xcite to co ( j = 1 @xmath0 0 ) by assuming the same constant ( 2 @xmath0 1)/(1 @xmath0 0 ) line ratio in units of k km s@xmath8 of 0.7 employed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "black open circles highlight a few galaxies of interest including the i  zw  18 limit @xcite as well as the recently reported lower limit to the co emission in wlm @xcite .",
    "we correct the wlm co ( j = 3 @xmath0 2 ) observation to co ( j = 1 @xmath0 0 ) by assuming the same ( 3 @xmath0 2)/(1 @xmath0 0 ) line ratio of 0.8 in units of k km s@xmath8 employed by @xcite .",
    "black filled circles represent the three galaxies in this study .",
    "it is clear from figure [ lcomet ] that the detection of co emission below metallicities of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath11 8.0 remains difficult . if our galaxies had co luminosities similar to the smc we clearly would have detected their emission .",
    "this lack of detection may not be due entirely to sensitivity issues , but may be the result of changes in the physical conditions that support co gas ( e.g. , metallicity , dust abundance , gas density , etc . ) .",
    "these changes in physical conditions have been noted several times in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the recent detection of co emission in the nearby galaxy wlm by @xcite suggest that newer technology may be able to detect co at much lower metallicities .",
    "deep co observations by observatories with larger light collecting areas such as the atacama large ( sub)millimeter array ( alma ) are needed to establish which of the above scenarios is the limiting factor in low metallicity co detection .      the luminosity of co is commonly used to infer the presence of molecular hydrogen . to convert l@xmath5  into m@xmath10  we need to know the relationship between the two quantities .",
    "substantial effort has been expended toward understanding this correlation ( see @xcite ) . for galactic metallicities",
    "the relationship between l@xmath5  and the h@xmath9  mass , m@xmath29 , is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 = 4.3 m@xmath14 ( k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26)@xmath8 .",
    "this conversion works because , at these metallicities , the co and h@xmath9  gas are coextensive .    for galaxies with metallicities much below solar ,",
    "this simple conversion is no longer valid .",
    "h@xmath9  can self - shield even with little dust present , thus there should exist clouds of `` co - faint '' h@xmath9  in star forming , low - metallicity environments which implies that the co and h@xmath9  are not coextensive .",
    "evidence for co - faint gas is particularly strong in the smc @xcite .",
    "these authors use star formation , dust , and gas tracers to infer the presence of molecular gas that emits only weakly in co , if at all .",
    "the deviation away from the galactic value of @xmath31 has also been inferred in co surveys of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we use our l@xmath5  limits to compute upper limits to m@xmath29 using a range of conversion factors .",
    "table [ h2masses ] lists computed h@xmath9  mass upper limits and the ratio of molecular - to - atomic hydrogen ( m@xmath29/m@xmath32 ) in the observed regions for various assumptions of @xmath31 described below . using the galactic value for @xmath31 results in molecular - to - atomic hydrogen mass ratios of @xmath21% for sextans  a and sextans  b and @xmath25% for leo  p , far below those typically observed in star - forming higher metallicity galaxies of 20 - 100% ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if we instead use the typical @xmath31 value inferred in the smc of 70 m@xmath14 ( k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26)@xmath8 @xcite , we compute h@xmath9  masses of @xmath210% of the  mass in sextans  a and sextans  b but @xmath280% for leo  p.",
    "lastly , we use the 3% solar metallicity models of @xcite to estimate m@xmath29 .",
    "these authors find that the conversion factor varies in their models from @xmath210 - 66.3 times the galactic value .",
    "a recent alma study of sbs  0335 - 052 @xcite suggests a lower limit value for @xmath31 @xmath33125 m@xmath14 ( k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26)@xmath8 at metallicities of @xmath23% solar , which falls within the range of values computed in @xcite .",
    "we use the larger value from @xcite here which corresponds to @xmath31 = 285 m@xmath14 ( k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26)@xmath8 to compute m@xmath29/m@xmath32 ratios of @xmath250% for sextans  a and sextans  b , and over 300% for leo  p. since low metallicity galaxies are dominated by atomic hydrogen , these unphysical molecular - to - atomic hydrogen mass ratios either rule out large values of @xmath31 or , more likely , the actual co emission in these galaxies is less than the derived upper limits .      yet another way of predicting the amount of h@xmath9  mass in the observed regions comes from the recent modelling of @xcite . this model ( hereafter kmt+ ) is an extension to the original models of @xcite and predicts both the h@xmath9-to-  mass suface density ratio , @xmath34 = @xmath35/@xmath36 , and the ensuing star formation rate surface density , @xmath37 . the kmt+ model assumes a two - phase ism where chemical equilibrium may never be reached prior to the onset of star formation in a low - metallicity environment . as a result , the formation of molecular species is more of a byproduct of the collapse of star forming clouds rather than preceded by it .",
    "that is , the h@xmath9  is formed in the centers of collapsing gas clouds where the temperatures are low enough and the densities are high enough rather than the molecules forming prior to the onset of collapse .",
    "this scenario thus suggests that large concentrations of molecular gas might not exist at extremely low metallicities .",
    "inputs into the kmt+ model are the total gas surface density , @xmath38 , the stellar + dark matter volume density ( @xmath39 ) , the metallicity ( z ) , and some nominal clumping factor ( cf ) .",
    "leo  p has a stellar mass of 5.7@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath22 and a radius of @xmath2 580 pc @xcite .",
    "if we assume the stars have a scale height of 100 pc then the stellar mass volume density is approximately 0.005 m@xmath22 pc@xmath40 .",
    "this value will change based upon our geometric assumptions and assumptions of the dark matter contribution .",
    "therefore we assume three different values for @xmath39 in order to bracket plausible values : the value in the solar neighborhood @xmath39 = 0.01 m@xmath22 pc@xmath40 @xcite and also values an order of magnitude above and below .",
    "@xcite suggests that cf = 1 for linear scales below @xmath2100 pc .",
    "the  linear beam sizes are @xmath233 pc for leo  p , @xmath280 pc for sextans  a , and @xmath2100 pc for sextans  b , thus we assume cf = 1 .",
    "we use the output @xmath34 values in combination with the  images to estimate the total h@xmath9  masses in each region .",
    "table [ krumh2masses ] shows the total h@xmath9  mass derived for each region in our galaxies .",
    "we can use these mass estimates to predict what values of l@xmath5 are expected for various assumptions of @xmath31 .",
    "we use the h@xmath9  mass estimates from the @xmath39 = 0.01 models for this exercise .",
    "the quoted errors reflect the values for the @xmath39 = 0.1 and 0.001 h@xmath9  mass estimates .",
    "table [ lcopreds ] lists various l@xmath5 predictions for our regions using the same @xmath31 values from table [ h2masses ] . if the kmt+ models are correct it seems very unlikely that co will be observed with current technology in leo  p , even with alma .",
    "the recent 3.4@xmath4 co detection ( l@xmath5 @xmath41 3670 k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26 ) reported by @xcite implies an @xmath31 @xmath16 60 m@xmath14 ( k km s@xmath8  pc@xmath26)@xmath8 in the kmt+ models .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with what is observed in objects of slightly higher metallicity ( e.g. , smc ) which require higher values of @xmath31 .",
    "there is hope , however , to observe co in sextans  a and sextans  b with modest alma observations .",
    "we use the sfrs computed from the h@xmath23 and fuv luminosities to compute limits to the amount of available molecular gas . to do this",
    "we need to multiply the sfr in units of m@xmath22 yr@xmath8 by an appropriate time scale .",
    "@xcite detail the sfrs of both sextans  a and sextans  b and show that the sfrs have remained relatively constant over the lifetimes of each galaxy with a relative uptick in sfr in the past @xmath25 gyr .",
    "there is currently no similar information available for leo  p. if we assume the sfrs have not changed significantly in the past couple of gyr , then we can use an estimation of the depletion timescale , that is , the amount of time it would take the current sfr to convert all of the available molecular gas into stars .",
    "@xcite find that for the smc , the molecular gas depletion time , @xmath42 , ranges from 0.6 - 7.5 gyr with large uncertainties depending on the linear scales probed .",
    "these authors results are similar to the results of other studies of molecular dominated regions in high metallicity galaxies conducted at 750 pc - 1 kpc scales which obtain @xmath42 @xmath2 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "we will adopt an order of magnitude approach to our calculation that will give us an upper limit to the amount of available molecular gas given our assumptions of a constant sfr over the depletion time of @xmath42 = 2 gyr .    with a depletion timescale of 2 gyr and the sfr@xmath43 values given in table [ galprops ] , we compute m@xmath29 = 1@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath22 , 3.4@xmath1210@xmath44 m@xmath22 , and 6.2@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath22 for leo  p , sextans  a , and sextans  b , respectively .",
    "these m@xmath29 values correspond to upper limits to the m@xmath29/m@xmath32 ratios of 33% , 39% , and 13% , respectively .",
    "computing the star formation rate using the h@xmath23 luminosity is notoriously unreliable at low metallicities @xcite .",
    "if instead we use the sfr@xmath45 values given in table [ galprops ] , we compute m@xmath29 = 1.0@xmath1210@xmath46 m@xmath22 and 2.3@xmath1210@xmath44 m@xmath22 for sextans  a and sextans  b , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to m@xmath29/m@xmath32 ratios of 114% and 49% .    in table",
    "[ halcopreds ] we compute the resulting co luminosities with our previous @xmath31 assumptions . if an @xmath47 of 4.3 is appropriate , we would have detected this amount of h@xmath9  in each of our galaxies with our observations .",
    "in fact , we would have detected sextans  a using any of the @xmath31 values with either sfr indicator .",
    "either the amount of co present in these galaxies is much lower than the upper limits calculated from the sfrs or our assumptions of a constant sfr and 2 gyr depletion timescale do not accurately describe the local physics .",
    "it is likely the depletion timescale is much longer than 2 gyr in low metallicity environments .",
    "the l@xmath5 values computed here are at least an order of magnitude more than those predicted by the kmt+ model for @xmath42 = 2 gyr .",
    "the kmt+ model allows for the depletion timescale to be as long as @xmath2100 gyr in the -dominated regions similar to what we expect in our systems .",
    "increasing the depletion timescale will , likewise , increase the derived l@xmath48 values .",
    "the data seem to favor larger values of @xmath49 but predicting an exact value requires more detailed understanding about the appropriate depletion timescales in each system .",
    "we present carma co ( j = 1 @xmath0 0 ) observations of three nearby , low - metallicity galaxies : leo  p , sextans  a , and sextans  b. we do not detect any co emission but derive very sensitive upper limits .",
    "we use the kmt+ models presented in @xcite and some reasonable physical assumptions to calculate a prediction for the estimated total mass of h@xmath9  in the three galaxies , as well as the expected co luminosity .",
    "we find that even under optimistic circumstances , co will be extremely difficult to observe in leo  p with current technology .",
    "on the other hand , co luminosities as low as  100 k km s@xmath8 pc@xmath50 can be detected with a modest amount of alma time , so sextans  a and sextans  b should be observable with alma . if future observations do find co emission in leo  p , then this may imply that the parameters in the kmt+ model and/or our assumptions about the physical conditions in leo  p are flawed in some way .",
    "even though co ( 1 - 0 ) has been the main tracer of molecular material in high - metallicity galaxies , other tracers of molecular gas need to be explored in low - metallicity systems .",
    "we suggest several useful observations that can trace molecular material in these systems .    1 .",
    "if the abundance of co is low and the emission is optically thin , observations of co ( j  =  2  @xmath0  1 ) may be a more sensitive probe of molecular gas in low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "the excitation conditions of the 2 - 1 transition are not particularly stringent , and the rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature can be up to 4 times higher than for the 1 - 0 transition in warm gas in lte for optically thin emission .",
    "continuum observations at sub - mm wavelengths ( e.g. , with alma band 9 ) would allow for a derivation of the dust content .",
    "it is interesting to note that the optical imaging and spectroscopy presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite each allow for the presence of a modest amount of differential extinction within leop .",
    "if dust is detected in leop , then this can be used to infer the presence of molecular material .",
    "we note that the observations of the local group galaxy wlm presented in @xcite made exactly such a prediction ; the subsequent detections of co in this system @xcite now represent the most metal - poor co measurement to date .",
    "observations of warm h@xmath9  emission lines in the infrared would allow for a direct search for molecular material ; while there would remain uncertainties about the excitation and temperature of the gas , such a detection of h@xmath51 that is co - spatial with the  maximum and star formation would provide the possibility for cooler h@xmath9  as well .",
    "emission from the [ cii ] 158 @xmath52 m line has been interpreted as a tracer of molecular gas in metal - poor environments @xcite .",
    "observations in this transition are possible with current instrumentation ( sofia ) , and could confirm the theoretical predictions described in the models discussed above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
