    "<S> we present an update of a spectroscopic follow - up survey at low - resolution of a large number of rr lyrae halo overdensity candidates found in the southern sky . </S>",
    "<S> the substructure candidates were identified in the rr  lyrae catalog of torrealba et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2015 ) using catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) data . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocities and mean metallicities have been estimated for target stars in almost half of the original overdensities to assess their potential membership to coherent halo features .    </S>",
    "<S> surveying the halo for substructure is important to identify the tidal remnants of accretion events that contributed to its formation . </S>",
    "<S> the northern sky has seen already a lot of progress towards this goal ( see review by belokurov 2013 ) , but the south remains quite unexplored . </S>",
    "<S> the crts with the work by torrealba et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2015 , from now on t15 ) has identified 27 overdensity candidates using rr  lyrae ( rrl ) variables . </S>",
    "<S> we started a low - resolution spectroscopic survey ( @xmath0 ) using primarily the goodman spectrograph at soar and the ldss3 at magellan . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained spectra to measure radial velocities and mean metallicities for the most promising targets . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocities are used in addition to positional information to search for stream - like features and metallicities for the stream candidate stars are measured to properly characterize the nature of the features found as real substructures .    </S>",
    "<S> we have covered so far 11 out of the 27 overdensities listed in t15 . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained more than one spectrum for at least 50% of our target rrl stars . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocities for 123 stars have been measured so far using templates from sesar ( 2012 ) , and mean metallicities have been estimated using a modified version of the @xmath1 method developed by layden ( 1994 ) for 99 of our targets . </S>",
    "<S> the typical errors in radial velocity and mean metallicity for the sample are @xmath220 km / s and @xmath20.2 dex , respectively .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  1 displays the rrls in the t15 catalog ( gray dots ) and those observed by us ( diamonds or ovals ) in each of the surveyed overdensities ( shaded polygons ) , color - coded according to their mean heliocentric distance .    </S>",
    "<S> our most interesting preliminary results indicate that we have probably found the southern extension of the virgo stellar stream velocity complex ( duffau et  al . </S>",
    "<S> 2014 ) in crv1 , while a bimodal radial velocity distribution in hya2 suggests there is indeed velocity substructure within the overdensity . </S>",
    "<S> hya1 is interesting as we have proper motion data available from the literature to combine with our radial velocities , and because in the same direction , albeit at a slightly larger heliocentric distance , a large overdensity has been identified by casetti - dinescu et  al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2015 ) as well . </S>",
    "<S> ant1 presents an extended radial velocity range with a narrow metallicity distribution , while cen3 has a velocity peak like the one expected for thick disk stars in the same direction of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> combining our data with proper motions , information available from other tracers , models of the disruption of the sagittarius dwarf and the smooth halo component of our galaxy will allow us to say more about the nature and origin of these overdensities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we will be able to explore the relation between the largest overdensity in t15 , sgr1 , and the tidal tails of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy . </S>"
