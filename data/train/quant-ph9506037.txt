    "furthermore we obtained four different types of infinite dimensional lie symmetry algebras , @xmath156 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 .",

    "there are no other local linearizations of the dg  equation .",
    "one type of linearizing transformations leaves the whole family of equations invariant , and was used to classify the subfamilies of the various lie symmetry algebras by gauge invariant parameters @xmath217 ( fig 1 . ) .",
    "the subfamily @xmath221 , @xmath222 , is outstanding because of its linearizability .",
    "the limiting case @xmath223 can be transformed into eulers equation @xcite and the methods to solve this subfamily can be adapted to the subfamily @xmath224 @xcite .",

    "the results for the schrdinger invariant subfamily are consistent ( up to a nonlinear gauge transformation ) with the results of g.  rideau and p.  winternitz @xcite in @xmath40 dimensions , who classified all evolution equations with @xmath228 lie symmetry algebra up to second order in spatial derivatives .",
    "the family in the _ gauge _ @xmath229 and @xmath214 is contained in their equation ( 3.6 ) for the special choice @xmath230 .",
    "finally note that for the subfamily there exists a hamilton functional generating the evolution equation @xcite and the corresponding dg  equation fits into the scheme of a nonlinear quantum theory proposed by s.  weinberg @xcite .",
