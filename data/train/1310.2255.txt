    "since early studies in the @xmath19s , we know that early - type galaxies ( etgs ) adhere to some empirical scaling relations , such as the luminosity - velocity dispersion @xcite , size - surface brightness @xcite , fundamental plane @xcite , black - hole mass - bulge mass @xcite , black - hole mass - velocity dispersion @xcite and black - hole mass - srsic index @xcite relations .",
    "such correlations , some of which were first used as distance estimators to help building the distance scale ladder , have given the astrophysical community important clues about the possible scenarios of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the same authors find indications of intrinsic size evolution , which can not be explained with the dilution of the population .",
    "in other words , @xcite find evidence that not all the progenitors of local quenched - etgs can be identified with the compact quiescent etgs observed at @xmath25 , because a substantial fraction of present - day etgs have stopped forming stars much later than the higher-@xmath5 etgs .",
    "an interesting conclusion of @xcite is that the stellar density of etgs scales with the mean density of the universe _ at the time of quenching_. this suggests that the host halo evolution could be the main driver of the galaxy evolution , in the sense that the redshift - dependence of the properties of an etg results similar to that of its host halo ( see also recent results by * ? ? ?",

    "there is not a unique method to identify a dm halo in a cosmological @xmath7-body simulation , because , as for every non - truncated and non - isolated particle system , it is not trivial to define the set of particles that belong to the object : various techniques have been proposed in the astrophysical literature ( e.g. , friends - of - friends or spherical overdensity algorithms ; see * ? ? ?",

    "the definition of the halo size is also non - trivial , since it is intimately affected by the choice of the spherical overdensity . as a matter of fact the definition of @xmath47 via equation",
    "is based on the idea that the material surrounding the overdensity is bound to the halo if the dynamical time of the particle is less than the hubble time at that redshift , so one can reasonably expect the halo of size @xmath47 to be in equilibrium .",
    "for this reason , @xmath47 is often , but improperly , called _ virial radius _ and , in any case , in the following we will adopt such convention .",
    "however , other definitions of the halo size are possible : for example , the gravitational radius ( i.e. , the true virial radius ) @xmath61 and the half - mass radius @xmath3 , i.e. , the radius of the sphere enclosing half the total mass of the halo , @xmath62 .    we also employ a definition of the halo velocity dispersion alternative to @xmath63 : we compute the velocity dispersion profile @xmath64 in the same fashion as the mass profile , where the velocity dispersion is calculated as in equation and the sum is only on the particles within the spherical region of radius @xmath45 . from the @xmath64 profile",
    ", we then estimate the _ central velocity dispersion _",
    "we define our sample of dm haloes by selecting those for which @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the convergence radius in the sense of @xcite , i.e. , the radius within which the two - body collisions dominate the orbital motions of the particles integrated by the code and the density estimates are therefore unreliable .",
    "we verified that , for our sample , the mass contained within the convergence radius is typically a small fraction of that contained within the half - mass radius , so our measurement of @xmath68 should be robust .",
    "the sample selected with the above criterion is made of @xmath69 dm haloes , with a lower limit in mass @xmath70 .              in this section",
    "we discuss the relations between different size and velocity dispersion estimators , in particular how the _ virial _ proxies ( @xmath47 , @xmath63 ) compare to the _ central _ ones ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 ) .    in this work we use @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see section [ sec : definitions ] ) to characterize the haloes because it is reasonable to expect that the stellar central velocity dispersion @xmath71 and the effective radius @xmath72 of the galaxies inside such haloes are more related to the halo central quantities than to the halo virial quantities .",
    "however , different choices would be possible .",
    "for instance , a tight correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath72 has been suggested , both theoretically ( see * ? ? ? * ) and using abundance matching techniques ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , it is well known that the ratio @xmath73 depends only weakly on the density profile ( see * ? ? ?",

    "it is therefore interesting to verify how the different proxies correlate in our sample of haloes and how their values depend on the choice of the critical overdensity @xmath43 .    in fig .",

    "we note that also the gravitational radius scales roughly as @xmath77 and this is because it depends only on virial quantities ( see equation [ def : rg ] ) , while the half - mass radius has slightly less steep dependence on @xmath43 , namely @xmath78 .",
    "this is an additional reason to prefer @xmath3 to @xmath47 in the present context .",
    "formally , also the quantity @xmath63 , and so @xmath2 , depends on @xmath43 , but the dependence is weak : the variation is no more than @xmath79 in @xmath63 , when varying @xmath43 by an order of magnitude .    in fig .",

    "we find that in all cases a linear correlation is in good agreement with the distribution of the haloes in the three planes ; fitting with power laws we get @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "interestingly , for a given halo , the ratio @xmath86 is very close to unity : the average ratio in our sample is @xmath87 .",
    "we recall that it is not a priori expected that the central quantities correlate linearly with the virial ones .",
    "this finding indicates that the dm haloes are not systematically non - homologous : in other words , more massive haloes are , on average , just rescaled versions of less massive haloes ( at least , as far as the relation between virial and central quantities is concerned ) .",
    "the scatter around the linear relations in fig .",
    "[ fig : rh - rg - rv ] can be ascribed to some degree of non - homology at a given halo mass or to the fact that some haloes are not completely virialized .",
    "we note also that @xcite recently found that there is a remarkable homology in their cluster - sized haloes sample : they argued that a tight relation exists between the mass and velocity dispersion profiles of dm haloes .",
    "moreover , they claimed that the mass - velocity dispersion relation of the halo sample is almost insensitive to the size definition ( in the range @xmath88 in equation [ def : halo ] ) because of such homology in the radial profiles .",
    "for the purposes of this work , given that , on average , the central quantities ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) scale linearly with the virial quantities ( @xmath63,@xmath47 ) , our results would be virtually unchanged if we adopted @xmath63 , instead of @xmath2 , and @xmath47 or @xmath74 , instead of @xmath3 , to characterize our haloes .      with the adopted halo definition ( equation [ def : deltac ] ) we expect the dm haloes to be virialized in every snapshot of the simulation from @xmath89 to @xmath22 .",

    "<S> we explore this hypothesis by studying the distribution of halo central velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) and half - mass radius ( @xmath3 ) as functions of halo mass @xmath4 and redshift @xmath5 , in a cosmological @xmath6-cdm @xmath7-body simulation . in the range @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath9 and @xmath10 , close to the values expected for homologous virialized systems . at fixed @xmath4 in the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 we find @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such evolution of the halo scaling laws is driven by individual haloes growing in mass following the evolutionary tracks @xmath14 and @xmath15 , consistent with simple dissipationless merging models in which the encounter orbital energy is accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the @xmath7-body data with etgs observed at @xmath16 by populating the haloes with a stellar component under simple but justified assumptions : the resulting galaxies evolve consistently with the observed etgs up to @xmath17 , but the model has difficulty reproducing the fast evolution observed at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a substantial fraction of the size evolution of etgs can be ascribed to a systematic dependence on redshift of the dark matter haloes structural properties .    </S>",
