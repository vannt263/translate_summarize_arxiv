[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     while higher snr thresholds tend to select higher equivalent width lines , the correspondence between the two quantities is complicated and the equivalent width distribution at a given signal - to - noise threshold varies in a complicated way with wavelength .",

    "[ saturation ] right panel ) .",
    "the trend of @xmath8 with redshift appears to be primarily driven by an evolution in the feii  equivalent width . fitting the medians of the distributions of the mgii  and feii  equivalent widths as a function of redshift results in measured slopes of @xmath580.06@xmath590.05 for @xmath5 vs. @xmath3 and @xmath580.20@xmath590.02 for @xmath35 vs. @xmath3 .",

    "although the catalog is constructed from the spectra of qsos observed uniformly with the sdss spectrographs , it is important to consider whether the observed trend could be the result of observational selection effects .",
    "as an initial test , we investigated whether the line ratios mgii  @xmath02796/mgii  @xmath02803 and feii  @xmath02586/feii  @xmath02600 in our sample show significant variation with redshift ; they do not , and fits ( to snr@xmath63 samples ) result in slopes of @xmath580.01@xmath590.13 and @xmath580.03@xmath590.01 respectively ( see also the left two panels of fig .",
    "[ saturation ] ) .",
    "in addition , the mgi@xmath02853/mgii equivalent width ratio does not vary significantly with redshift ( slope of 0.02@xmath590.01 ) . changing the subsamples by varying the signal - to - noise ratio cutoff does not change these results significantly , although in the case of the feii  @xmath02586/feii  @xmath02600 ratio , higher snr cuts result in a slightly more significant detection of a trend ( e.g. , for snr@xmath225 , feii  @xmath02586/feii  @xmath02600 vs. redshift has a slope of @xmath60 ) .",
    "while the wavelength separation between these various features is smaller than that between the mgii  and feii  features , there does not appear to be any systematic effect introduced by the fact that the lines are measured in different parts of the spectrum .",
    "the division in spectral coverage between the blue and red spectrographs at @xmath61  does result in a lower detection efficiency of absorption lines at these wavelengths and results in a slightly higher median equivalent width for the @xmath62 bin ; however , there is no obvious feature in the distribution of the line ratios and this bin does not affect the determination of the overall trend .    in order to determine whether the complicated selection function for absorption line detection could be responsible for the trend , we used the measured selection function from zm13 to create 1000 simulated datasets as follows .",
    "we simulated a large number of mgii  absorption lines ( distributed randomly in redshift within each redshift bin ) using the best - fit intrinsic exponential distribution of rest equivalent width computed by zm13 ( see equation 3 and table 1 in zm13 ) .",
    "for each mgii  absorber , the @xmath63 doublet ratio was drawn from a lognormal model based on a fit to the observed distribution of the ratio in the jhu - sdss dataset .",
    "then , for each mgii  absorber , an feii  absorption line was drawn randomly from a normal distribution of @xmath8 with a mean of 0.233 and @xmath64=0.143 . in order to test whether the selection would generate a systematic bias , the @xmath8 distribution was assumed to be constant with redshift .",
    "equivalent width uncertainties for the mgii and feii lines were assigned randomly , drawn from model fits to the actual fractional error distributions in these two lines . in each case",
    ", we constructed the two - dimensional distribution of @xmath65 versus @xmath66 and modeled the surface as a lognormal in @xmath65 and a polynomial in @xmath66 .",
    "we then  observed \" this set of intrinsic mgii+feii  absorbers using the equivalent width selection function for the jhu - sdss catalog ( zm13 ) .",
    "we selected absorbers and fit each of the 1000 such datasets in the same manner in which we fit the observed catalog and derived slope measurements for any gradient in @xmath13 ratio with redshift .",
    "since there was no evolution assumed in the data , any resulting slope is purely due to selection effects ( i.e. , completeness as a function of equivalent width and observed wavelength ) and the variation in the intrinsic distribution of @xmath5 with redshift .",
    "we do not detect the observed slope in the simulated @xmath8 distribution with a high degree of reliability .",
    "the 1000 trials resulted in a normal distribution of slopes with a small negative bias ( median recovered slope = @xmath67 ; standard deviation of 0.0033 ) ; the 95% ( 99% ) confidence limits on the slope are [ @xmath68 ( [ @xmath69 ) and none of the 1000 trials resulted in slope determinations @xmath70 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed trend is not the result of selection effects .",
    "our results show that the ratio of the equivalent widths of feii  to mgii  absorption lines along the lines of sight to qsos decreases with redshift .",
    "the trend survives a range of signal - to - noise ratio or equivalent width cuts and does not appear to be due to selection effects within the jhu - sdss zm13 dataset . in this section ,",
    "we discuss possible physical origins for the equivalent width ratio evolution .",
    "the strength of an isolated absorption line as measured by its equivalent width is related to its abundance in the gas phase and the velocity spread of the gas @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the @xmath13 ratio in terms of the fe / mg abundance ratio .",
    "however , in order to interpret the observed equivalent widths in terms of physical quantities associated with the absorbing clouds , we need to consider the effects of ( i ) saturation , ( ii ) kinematics , ( iii ) ionization , and ( iv ) depletion .",
    "we consider each of these in turn .    _",
    "( i ) line saturation : _ the @xmath5 distribution for the snr@xmath63 sample is a lognormal which peaks at @xmath71 , implying that the individual doublet lines have typical equivalent widths @xmath221  and lie in the logarithmic ( i.e. ,  saturated \" ) part of the curve of growth .",
    "it is therefore not obvious that we can interpret any observed trend with redshift as resulting from a trend in the abundance ratio of mg to fe without first understanding the effects of line saturation .    in order to investigate the effects of saturation on the observed ratio",
    ", we computed the curves of growth for mgii  and feii  for two different values of the doppler parameter , @xmath72=10  km  s@xmath73 and 50  km  s@xmath73 . for each case , we computed the expected @xmath8 values that result from a wide range in mgii  column density @xmath74 and [ mg / fe ] varying between 1 and 10 times the solar value . for a given @xmath72 ,",
    "even strongly saturated lines result in the equivalent width ratio @xmath8 depending on the [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio .",
    "hence , even if the observed absorption lines are single and saturated , they only dampen , but not erase , an intrinsic variation of the abundance ratio .",
    "most mgii absorption systems with @xmath75  are multiple systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this complicates the simple picture described here . fully modeling",
    "the result of saturation and multiplicity is beyond the scope of this paper , but instead we look to the data for clues to whether saturation effects are responsible for the observed trends .",
    "[ saturation ] shows the effect of saturation on three pairs of equivalent width ratios in our observational dataset .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath76 ratios ( shown in the first two panels ) asymptote toward the saturation value with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "however , neither of these ratios shows any evolution with redshift .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath13 ratio clearly evolves , with the median line ratio decreasing with increasing redshift in _ all _ @xmath5 bins .",
    "[ saturation ] also shows that the higher equivalent width bins also exhibit the evolution with redshift , albeit at lower strength than the lower equivalent width ( and less saturated ) bins .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that saturation effects will tend to weaken the relationship between @xmath8 and the intrinsic feii / mgii  abundance ratio of the absorbers , and then that these effects are likely only to dampen ( rather than induce ) a potential trend in @xmath8 with redshift .    _",
    "( ii ) multiplicity & kinematics : _ if the observed absorption lines are instead the result of blends of multiple unresolved ( lower equivalent width ) lines , then the individual lines might arise in lower column density clouds and are therefore presumably less saturated .",
    "the real situation is likely to be more complicated , with lines forming in clouds with varying kinematic properties .",
    "high - resolution studies have demonstrated that mgii lines are often made up of a number of components , typically between 2 and 10 , with the number of components increasing with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , they also find that the mgii and feii absorption lines show similar doppler parameters and correlated column densities and the distribution of @xmath77 column ratios does not depend strongly on velocity spread @xcite , nor does the kinematic spread show any evidence for significant evolution with redshift @xcite .",
    "hence , assuming the feii and mgii absorption lines are equally sensitive to the variations in the clouds as they evolve , the evolution of the ratio @xmath13 for individual absorption systems should change monotonically with the abundance ratio @xmath78 , although the magnitude of the change may be dampened by saturation effects .",
    "if , for some reason , the velocity structure or doppler parameter for these two species differs , due to e.g. , differences in ionization structure or incomplete mixing of metal species , this monotonic relation can break down . for example , incomplete metal mixing could arise in a delayed fe - enrichment scenario : if the kinematic spread of fe - rich material is narrower than that of @xmath10-enriched gas , this could give rise to a suppressed @xmath13 ratio without it reflecting a true dearth of fe atoms .",
    "however , even if this somewhat contrived scenario were realized , it would still point to an evolution in the sources of cgm enrichment . while it may be possible to create a trend in @xmath8 with redshift as a result of an evolving @xmath72",
    ", there is no obvious reason why the doppler parameter would evolve with redshift for just one species .",
    "better spectroscopic data ( higher spectral resolution , and on more species and ionization states ) on much larger samples than currently exist can help explore this issue further .    _",
    "( iii ) ionization correction : _ the first two ionization potentials for mg and fe are very similar : for mgi@xmath79mgii and fei@xmath79feii , they are 7.646 ev and 7.902ev respectively ; the second ionization potentials ( i.e. , mgii@xmath79mgiii and feii@xmath79feiii ) are 15.0357 ev and 16.1878 ev respectively @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the ionic abundances of the two elements , @xmath80 , is determined by the shape ( at these energies ) of the spectrum of the ionizing metagalactic radiation , which does not vary significantly over the redshift range considered here . using the @xcite model for the uv metagalactic flux as a function of redshift",
    ", we find that the ratio of the emissivity at the mg and fe 1st ionization potentials varies by less than 4% for @xmath81 ; the emissivity ratio at the wavelengths of the 2nd ionization potential varies by less than 2% .",
    "the bulk of the absorbers ( @xmath2296% ) in the jhu - sdss metal absorption line catalog have @xmath82 .",
    "these absorbers therefore correspond to regions with hydrogen column densities of @xmath83 ( if the doppler parameter is 10  km  s@xmath73 ; * ? ? ?",

    "they find that for hydrogen column densities @xmath84 , the n(mgii)/n(feii ) ratio ( and hence its inverse ) is essentially constant over a wide range of ionization parameter ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore unlikely that differences in ionization could drive the observed trend .    _",
    "( iv ) depletion : _",
    "mgii  absorption line systems are known to contain dust , exhibiting dust - to - gas ratios comparable to that observed for normal galaxies @xcite . since both mg and fe can be depleted onto dust grains ,",
    "it is necessary to understand whether differing depletion rates for the two elements as a function of redshift can result in the trend observed in their equivalent width ratios .    based on studies of the interstellar medium in our galaxy , the depletion rate for fe is approximately 2@xmath587 times larger than that for mg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , fe is depleted from the gas phase at a higher rate than is mg . using the tabulated model of @xcite for the dependence of the mg and fe gas phase abundance on the line - of - sight depletion strength @xmath85 , we find that the column density ratio @xmath86 varies as @xmath87 , i.e. , the gas - phase column density ratio increases with increasing depletion and dustier absorbing clouds ( which would presumably be more depleted in mg and fe ) would exhibit higher values of @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the only way to reproduce a trend where the @xmath13 ratio decreases with redshift through purely dust depletion effects is to have higher redshift absorbers be dustier ( and more depleted ) than lower redshift absorbers , an unlikely scenario .",
    "in contrast , we expect fe and dust content to increase as the universe ages and that fe is likely to be fractionally more depleted onto dust at lower redshift .",
    "hence , any detection of an increase ( to lower redshift ) in the observed gas - phase fe / mg abundance ratio is likely to reflect a stronger intrinsic increase in the abundance ratio . in other words",
    ", a measurement of the gas - phase fe / mg ratio would underestimate the true fe / mg , and the factor by which it is underestimated would be larger at low redshift than at high redshift .",
    "this goes in the sense , therefore , of making the observed relation imply a stronger underlying variation .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that depletion effects could explain away the observed trend .",
    "in contrast to various possible ( and somewhat contrived ) explanations discussed above , the expected variation of the rates of snia and ccsn should naturally produce the observed variation in @xmath8 and we therefore consider this next .",
    "we model the average universal fe / mg abundance ratio as resulting from the supernovae formed at each epoch as a result of the cosmic star formation rate history .",
    "we assume that the rate of core collapse supernovae follows the cosmic star formation rate density ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath88 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the number density of element @xmath100 is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the relative atomic mass of element @xmath100 .",

    "this simple model over - predicts the observed snia rates by a factor of 2 and over - predicts the solar photospheric abundance ratio of fe / mg at redshift @xmath107 by @xmath108 .",
    "this is not surprising given the large uncertainties in the yields and our other assumptions ( e.g. , ignoring the contribution from agb stars , uncertainties / variations in the imf , dtd , sfrd , and the large scatter in the data ) .",
    "rate by a factor of 0.6 can result in both a better fit to the observed rates and the solar abundance ratio . ]",
    "recently , @xcite modeled the metal enrichment in a galaxy resulting from agb stars and sne , investigating different assumptions for sn yields and snia dtds .",
    "they find that the observed local mass - metallicity relationships and the [ o / fe ] abundance in the milky way can be reproduced by models in which the snia dtd is a power - law and the light @xmath10 elements are expelled in galactic winds .",
    "the redshift variation of the fe / mg ratio computed by @xcite for a model milky way - type galaxy using a power - law dtd is also shown in fig .  [ models ] ; rather remarkably , its slope matches the evolution in @xmath8 observed in the jhu - sdss dataset .",
    "this lends further , though still circumstantial , support that the observed evolution can be explained as the result of the increasing dominance of snia yields changing the mean composition of the outflowing gas responsible for the absorption line systems over time .",
    "the comparisons of the models to the slopes measured in the data are only meant to be illustrative and not discriminatory .",
    "the scatter in the slope measurement is large and the models are only notional at this stage .",
    "nevertheless it is instructive that the measured variation shows slopes comparable to those predicted by models where all the evolution in the abundance ratios is the result of star formation in galaxies and enriched material ejected into their gaseos halos .",
    "the large scatter in the data may reflect the diversity of star formation histories , impact parameters of qso lines of sight through halos , and inhomogeneities in the halo gas .",
    "individual absorbers at any given redshift show significant scatter and the trend ( of @xmath8 with @xmath3 ) reported here is subtle ; it was only possible to measure the trend using the very large catalog of absorbers resulting from the sdss qso spectra .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that previous high - resolution studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not see the trend of @xmath8 with redshift in the small samples ( @xmath109 absorbers ) studied ( however , please see @xcite s analysis of the @xcite dataset , where a possible trend of decreasing @xmath110 is reported ) . in a",
    "vlt / uves high - resolution study of 100 weak ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) mgii  absorbers , @xcite found that clouds with high @xmath13 disappear from their sample at high redshift ( @xmath112 ) . in a complementary study of 81 strong absorbers identified in the same dataset",
    ", @xcite found that the @xmath13 ratio for @xmath113  absorbers is typically high and exhibits some evolution with redshift ; weaker absorbers ( 0.3@xmath114 ) instead showed a wider range and scatter in the @xmath13 ratio with no obvious trend .",
    "the authors interpret this as primarily due to kinematics : high - redshift absorbers with @xmath113  tend to be formed in regions with more kinematic spread ( and the feii  and mgii  lines are less saturated ) than their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "they also consider the effects of ionization and @xmath10-enhancement , but conclude that they can not discriminate between these effects .",
    "the sdss spectra have insufficient resolution to explore this issue adequately @xcite .",
    "however , splitting the sample into two equivalent width bins  0.3@xmath115  and @xmath116  following @xcite  we find that both subsets show evolution ( with slopes and 95% confidence ranges of @xmath117 , [ @xmath118 and @xmath119 , [ @xmath120 respectively ) .",
    "there is also evidence that the @xmath8 values show a much broader distribution for the 0.3@xmath115  subset than for the @xmath121  subset .",
    "it is not obvious from the large sdss dataset , therefore , whether splitting the data by equivalent width is justified or if the absorber population should be treated as a continuum , reflecting a range of gas physical conditions in the halos of galaxies .",
    "given the various caveats already described in using low - resolution data , it will be necessary to obtain high resolution spectroscopic observations of a sufficiently large sample ( @xmath1221000s ) of absorbers to properly disentangle the effects of saturation , kinematics and abundance .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the scatter in the equivalent width and ratio distributions compared to the results from numerical simulations will help us further understand the range of physical conditions in galaxy halos .",
    "we have investigated the equivalent width ratio @xmath123 for a large sample of mgii absorption line systems from the jhu - sdss metal absorption line catalog of @xcite and discovered that the ratio shows a trend with redshift .",
    "this trend does not appear to be the result of data artifacts or selection effects in the catalog .",
    "several reasons may exist for the observed evolution .",
    "however , a simple model shows that the trend is naturally explained by the evolving fe / mg abundance ratio that results from the changing relative rates of type ia and core - collapse sne .",
    "star - formation ( and hence supernovae production ) is primarily located in galactic disks , whereas the absorption lines under investigation here form in circumgalactic clouds in galaxy halos at large galactocentric distances .",
    "hence , if the equivalent width ratio reflects abundance variations in the cgm clouds , and if the enrichment by supernovae is indeed the primary cause for the cgm metallicity variations , then outflows must be efficient in transporting metals out of star - forming disks to large galactocentric radii .",
    "future spectroscopic surveys with the next generation of highly multiplexed multi - object spectrographs ( e.g. , desi on the mayall telescope , pfs on subaru , and 4most on vista ) will result in larger samples of absorption line systems and the ability to explore the chemical evolution of the universe in greater detail .",
    "higher signal - to - noise ratio and higher resolution spectroscopy of large samples spanning a large redshift range can confirm whether the trend observed in the fe / mg ratio is observed in other @xmath10-element lines and explore whether the changes are due to the chemical enrichment history of the universe ( as suggested here ) or if evolution in the cloud properties ( e.g. , ionization , kinematics , doppler parameter , substructure , etc . ) is instead responsible for the trend .",
    "detailed comparisons between the data and state - of - the - art cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be critical to this effort .",
