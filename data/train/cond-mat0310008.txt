    "recently , @xmath4-electron compounds with the hocoga@xmath0-type `` 115 '' tetragonal crystal structure have been intensively investigated in both the experimental and theoretical research fields of condensed matter physics . among such compounds , interesting magnetic properties",
    "have been reported for umga@xmath0 , where m is a transition metal ion .",
    "@xcite in particular , neutron scattering experiments have revealed that uniga@xmath0 exhibits the g - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase , while updga@xmath0 and uptga@xmath0 have the a - type af state .",
    "@xcite note that g - type indicates a three - dimensional nel state , while a - type denotes a layered af structure in which spins align ferromagnetically ( fm ) in the @xmath5 plane and af along the @xmath6 axis.@xcite it is quite interesting that the magnetic structure is different for u-115 compounds which differ only by the substitution of transition metal ions .",
    "u-115 materials have also been found to differ in their magnetic anisotropy . for m",
    "= ni , pd , and pt , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 exhibit curie - weiss behavior , but @xmath7 is somewhat larger than @xmath8,@xcite where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are magnetic susceptibilities for magnetic field parallel to the @xmath9 and @xmath6 axes , respectively .",
    "this anisotropy increases in the sequence uniga@xmath0 , updga@xmath0 , and uptga@xmath0 . on the other hand , for m = co , rh , ir , fe , ru , and os , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are almost independent of temperature , since these are pauli paramagnets , but in these cases @xmath8 is somewhat larger than @xmath7",
    "nonetheless , we again observe a tendency for the anisotropy to become larger for the progression from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and then to @xmath12 m ions .",
    "thus , it is characteristic of u-115 compounds that the magnetic properties are sensitive to the choice of transition metal ions .",
    "furthermore , uga@xmath1 , which is the mother compound of umga@xmath0 , has also provided intriguing experimental results .",
    "it has been reported that uga@xmath1 exhibits a g - type af metallic phase in the low - temperature region,@xcite but a `` hidden '' ordering different from the magnetic one has been suggested by resonant x - ray scattering measurements.@xcite unfortunately , orbital ordering in uga@xmath1 is not yet confirmed experimentally , but it may be an interesting possibility to understand the result of resonant x - ray scattering experiment on uga@xmath1 based on the orbital - ordering scenario .    here",
    "we note that one must pay close attention to the meanings of `` spin '' and `` orbital '' in @xmath4-electron systems . since they are tightly coupled with each other through a strong spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "distinguishing them is not straightforward in comparison with @xmath13-electron systems .",
    "this point can create serious problems when we attempt to understand microscopic aspects of magnetism and superconductivity in @xmath4-electron compounds .",
    "thus , it is necessary to carefully define the terms `` orbital '' and `` spin '' for @xmath4 electrons in a microscopic discussion of magnetism and superconductivity in uranium compounds . in order to overcome this difficulty , we have proposed to employ a @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme to discuss @xmath4-electron systems.@xcite",
    "let us note the advantages of the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme at the outset .",
    "first , it is quite convenient for the inclusion of many - body effects using standard quantum - field theoretical techniques , since individual @xmath4-electron states are clearly defined .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath14 coupling scheme we can not use such standard techniques , since wick s theorem does not hold .",
    "second we can , in principle , include the effects of valence fluctuations . in some uranium compounds ,",
    "the valence of the uranium ion is neither definitely u@xmath15 nor u@xmath16 , indicating that the @xmath4-electron number takes a value between 2 and 3 . in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme",
    "this is simply regarded as the average number of @xmath4 electron per uranium ion .    in this paper , then , we propose a new scenario based on the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme in order to understand the magnetic properties of uranium compounds , of which uga@xmath1 and umga@xmath0 are considered to be typical examples . a microscopic model constructed from the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme is analyzed using an unbiased method , such as the lanczos technique .",
    "for uga@xmath1 we obtain a phase diagram , including the paramagnetic ( pm ) state and several types of af phases .",
    "in particular , we note that the pm state is adjacent to an af metallic phase , consistent with the experimental results for uranium compounds having the aucu@xmath1-type crystal structure .",
    "we also discuss the orbital structure of the af metallic phase . by taking account of the effects of two - dimensionality",
    ", we find that the change in magnetic structure from g- to a - type af phases is reproduced , consistent with experimental results for umga@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the observed trends of the magnetic anisotropy within the umga@xmath0 series can be understood from the present results .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will introduce a microscopic model hamiltonian formulated on the basis of the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme . in sec .",
    "iii , numerical results for uga@xmath1 and umga@xmath0 are discussed in detail and compared with experimental results . in sec .",
    "iv , future developments are discussed and the paper is summarized . in the appendix , we analyze the local @xmath4-electron configuration in order to examine the validity of the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling picture @xmath17-@xmath9-@xmath17 experimental results on the level scheme in certain @xmath4-electron materials . throughout the paper",
    ", we use units such that @xmath18=@xmath19=1 .",
    "in this section we derive a microscopic hamiltonian for uga@xmath1 and umga@xmath0 based on the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the valence of the uranium ion , here we assume that the formal valence is u@xmath15 , including three @xmath4 electrons per ion . by considering the crystalline electric field ( cef ) potential and coulomb interactions , we then assign three electrons to states in the @xmath2=5/2 sextet .",
    "first , we define the one @xmath4-electron states in the aucu@xmath1-type cubic crystal structure .",
    "the effects of tetragonality will be discussed later . from the work of hutchings for the case of cubic symmetry , @xcite we identify two eigen energies as @xmath20 for the @xmath21 doublet and @xmath22 for the @xmath23 quartet , where @xmath24 is a cubic cef parameter .    in order to proceed with the discussion , it is necessary to know which is lower , @xmath21 or @xmath23 , in the one @xmath4-electron picture .",
    "for some crystal structures it is possible to determine the level scheme from intuitive discussions of @xmath4-electron wavefunctions and the positions of ligand ions . however , this is not the case for the aucu@xmath1-type crystal structure . for this case",
    "we invoke certain experimental results on cein@xmath1 , a typical aucu@xmath1-type ce - based compound , where @xmath21 and @xmath23 have been reported as ground and excited states , respectively , with an energy difference of 12mev.@xcite thus , we take @xmath21 to be lower for the present considerations , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) .    in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme for uga@xmath1",
    ", we accommodate three electrons in the one - electron energy states @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "there are two possibilities , i.e. , low- and high - spin states , depending on the hund s rule interaction and the splitting between the @xmath21 and @xmath23 levels . noting that the effective hund s rule interaction is small in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme,@xcite the low - spin state should be realized , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , this low - spin state is also consistent with the @xmath14 coupling scheme .",
    "details regarding electron configurations in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme are discussed in the appendix .    in the electron configuration shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the @xmath21 level is fully occupied to form a singlet .",
    "if this @xmath21 level is located well below the @xmath23 , the occupying electrons will not contribute to the magnetic properties .",
    "thus , we may be allowed to ignore the @xmath21 electrons for our present purposes , but this simplification will be examined more carefully in the following subsection .",
    "electrons in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme for ( a ) cein@xmath1 and ( b ) uga@xmath1 .",
    "note that up and down arrows denote pseudospin states in order to distinguish the two states of the kramers doublet . ]",
    "first , we discuss the @xmath4-electron kinetic term given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the annihilation operator for an @xmath4-electron with pseudospin @xmath27 in the @xmath28-orbital at site @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the @xmath4-electron hopping matrix element between @xmath28-and @xmath31-orbitals along the @xmath32 direction . indices @xmath9 and @xmath33 denote the @xmath34 and @xmath35 orbitals , respectively , while @xmath6 indicates the @xmath21 . here , the pseudospin has been introduced to distinguish the two states of the kramers doublet .",
    "when we evaluate @xmath30 for nearest - neighbor hopping via the @xmath27 bond , it is given by @xmath36 for the @xmath37-direction , @xmath38 for the @xmath39-direction , and @xmath40 for the @xmath3-direction .",
    "note that @xmath41=@xmath42 in the cubic system . in this paper",
    ", @xmath42 is taken as the unit of energy .",
    "later , @xmath41 will be treated as an extra parameter in order to take account of the tetragonality .",
    "we immediately notice that non - zero hoppings occur only among @xmath23 orbitals . since the @xmath21 orbital has nodes along the cubic axes , it is localized in the present tight - binding approximation .",
    "this further justifies the suppression of @xmath21 .",
    "one may question the foregoing approach on the grounds that it is based entirely on nearest - neighbor hopping processes . in order to address this concern ,",
    "it is useful to examine the results of band - structure calculations , e.g. , for cein@xmath1 ( ref .  ) and uga@xmath1 ( ref .  ) .",
    "note that both results have been obtained assuming the system is in the paramagnetic state . in order to focus on the @xmath4 electron components of the energy band , we concentrate on the bands around the @xmath43 point near the fermi level .",
    "for cein@xmath1 , the energy band dominated by @xmath21 character is found to be lower than the @xmath23-dominated band , consistent with the local level scheme in fig .",
    "an important point is that the fermi level intersects the @xmath21-dominant band , indicating that the fermi surface is mainly composed of @xmath21 electrons hybridized with ga - ion @xmath44 electrons .    on the other hand , for uga@xmath1",
    ", the @xmath21 band is also lower than the @xmath23 band , but here the fermi level crosses the @xmath23 band .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 band appears to be fully occupied , consistent with the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling level scheme , as shown in fig .",
    "since the main contribution to the fermi surface comes from @xmath23 electrons , it is natural to dwell on the @xmath23 bands and ignore the occupied @xmath21 bands in giving further consideration to many - body effects .",
    "it is useful to consider the fermi - surface structure of @xmath45 in comparison with that of the band calculations . in fig .  2",
    ", we show fermi - surface sheets derived from @xmath45 for the case of @xmath46=1 , where @xmath47 indicates the average number of @xmath23 electrons per site . owing to the multi - orbital nature of the problem , we observe two fermi - surface sheets .",
    "a cube - like fermi surface is centered on the @xmath43 point and a second sheet is composed of three connected tubes along the three cubic axes .    in the band - structure calculation results , two fermi surface sheets",
    "are also observed.@xcite one sheet surrounds the @xmath43 point with a small hole at the center .",
    "another is a large sphere - like fermi surface centered at the r point .",
    "since the carrier number is simply fixed at unity per site in the tight - binding model , it is difficult to obtain perfect agreement . except for details",
    ", however , @xmath45 can reproduce the fermi - surface structure of the band calculation in spite of its simplification .",
    "tight - binding model for @xmath47=1 .",
    "note that we obtain two fermi - surface sheets , ( a ) and ( b ) , due to the multi - orbital nature of the model .",
    "note also that both sheets are depicted in the electron picture .",
    "the bounding box indicates the first brillouin zone for a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the @xmath43 point is located at the center of the box , while the apices denote r points . ]      following the above discussion , the effective hamiltonian for uranium compounds will be expressed by a @xmath23-orbital degenerate hubbard model , given as @xmath48 where @xmath45 denotes the @xmath23 part of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and @xmath49 is written as @xmath50 here @xmath51=@xmath52 and @xmath53= @xmath54 .",
    "the level splitting @xmath55 between @xmath23 orbitals is introduced in order to consider certain tetragonal cef effects for the case of umga@xmath0 .",
    "when we analyze the magnetic properties of uga@xmath1 , this term is not needed . for the time being , @xmath55 is then set to be zero .    the coulomb interaction term @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 denote intra - orbital , inter - orbital , exchange , and pair - hopping interactions , respectively .",
    "these are expressed in terms of racah parameters , and the relation @xmath58=@xmath59+@xmath60+@xmath61 holds due to the rotational invariance in orbital space.@xcite for @xmath13-electron systems , one also has the relation @xmath60=@xmath61 . when the electronic wavefunction is real , this relation is easily demonstrated from the definition of the coulomb integral .",
    "however , in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme the wavefunction is complex , and @xmath60 is not equal to @xmath61 in general . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume here that @xmath60=@xmath61 , noting that essential results are not affected .",
    "since double occupancy of the same orbital is suppressed owing to the large value of @xmath58 , pair - hopping processes are irrelevant in the present case .",
    "among several possible methods to analyze the present microscopic model , in this paper we have employed the exact diagonalization technique .",
    "although this has the drawback that it is difficult to enlarge the system size , this method offers the clear advantage that it is possible to deduce the magnetic structure in an unbiased manner . in order to discuss the ground - state properties , it is useful to calculate both the spin and orbital correlations , which are defined , respectively , by @xmath62 with @xmath63= @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66=@xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 is the number of sites .",
    "first let us consider the cubic system .",
    "due to severe limitations of computer memory , our calculations are restricted to a 2@xmath692@xmath692 cube .",
    "nonetheless , essential points on the spin structure can be captured . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , as a typical result for spin correlation , we show @xmath70 as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath59=6 . from the changes in the dominant component",
    ", we can define three regions as ( i ) @xmath60@xmath710.45 , ( ii ) 0.45@xmath71@xmath60@xmath712.05 , and ( iii ) @xmath60@xmath722.05 . in region",
    "i , the dominant component of @xmath70 appears at @xmath73=@xmath74 , indicating a g - type af structure .",
    "definitions of spin structure are shown in fig .",
    "note that for c - type [ @xmath73=@xmath75 , @xmath75 , @xmath75 ] and a - type [ @xmath73=@xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 structure , @xmath70 has the same value for each @xmath73 due to the cubic symmetry . in region",
    "ii , 0.45@xmath71@xmath60@xmath712.05 , the cubic symmetry seems to be broken .",
    "of course , this is spurious because of the smallness of the system , but for reasons given below , this phase is considered to be `` metallic '' , and it is conventionally called the pm phase . note that the af correlation with @xmath80 is still dominant for 0.45@xmath71@xmath60@xmath710.8 , indicating that the system is in a metallic magnetic phase . for 0.8@xmath71@xmath60@xmath712.05 , a - type af correlations turn out to be dominant .     as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath59=6 .",
    "( b ) spin structures in the fm , a - type af , c - type af , and g - type af phases . ]    here we discuss the evidence for a crossover between insulating and metallic behavior given by the spin correlation function . in an insulating phase , the spin structure is essentially determined by a round trip for an electron just between neighboring sites , leading to orbital - dependent superexchange interactions .",
    "thus , cubic symmetry is maintained in the spin correlation function even for a small - sized cluster such as a 2@xmath692@xmath692 cube .",
    "however , in the pm metallic phase , electrons tend to gain kinetic energy by moving around the whole system .",
    "such a motion depends sensitively on the anisotropy of the shape of the orbital .",
    "specifically , in a small - sized cluster , the spin correlation function in the pm phase depends on the choice of the basis set for orbitals , and the cubic symmetry of the spin correlations appear to be broken owing to the smallness of the system .",
    "thus , the spurious violation of cubic symmetry in the spin correlations is considered to be a signal for a metallic phase .",
    "note that the metal - insulator boundary itself depends on the system size . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", cubic symmetry should exist in the metallic phase , since the effect of orbital anisotropy is smeared by averaging over the whole system .",
    "in fact , the band dispersion relation has cubic symmetry , as is easily checked by diagonalizing @xmath45 in momentum space .",
    "when we further increase the value of @xmath60 , the spin correlations recover cubic symmetry in region iii , @xmath60@xmath722.05 .",
    "again we find an insulating phase , but the spin structure is now considered to be a - type af . the change from g- to a - type af phase with increasing @xmath60",
    "can be understood in terms of the competition between kinetic and magnetic energies , in analogy with manganites.@xcite namely , for large @xmath60 there is an energy gain for an fm spin pair on neighboring sites , but not for an af spin pair .",
    "thus , there is a tendency for the occurrence of ferromagnetism in the large-@xmath60 region .",
    "when we compare the magnetic energy of nearest - neighbor pairs , we notice that the number of fm pairs in the a - type af phase is larger than for the g - type phase .",
    "thus , for large values of @xmath60 the a - type phase appears .     for @xmath81 .",
    "meanings of the symbols are the same as those in fig .",
    "orbital arrangements ( b ) for @xmath60@xmath710.7 and ( c ) for @xmath60@xmath720.7 . ]    in fig .",
    "4(a ) we show typical results for orbital correlations as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath59=6 . corresponding to the changes in the dominant component of the spin correlation",
    ", we again see three regions . in region i ( @xmath60@xmath710.45 ) ,",
    "@xmath82 has two degenerate dominant components of @xmath73=@xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the orbital pattern is given by a mixture of two a - type orbital correlations , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "since the hamiltonian is not invariant under orbital exchange , @xmath82 should not have the same magnitude for @xmath73=@xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath83 . on the other hand , in region iii ( @xmath60@xmath722.05 )",
    "the @xmath84 component is dominant , suggesting a g - type orbital pattern as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) .     for @xmath60=0 .",
    "( b ) orbital correlation as a function of @xmath59 for @xmath60=0 .",
    "( c ) phase diagram for uga@xmath1 obtained by the exact diagonalization .",
    "the region of @xmath60@xmath85@xmath59 is ignored , since it is unphysical .",
    "see fig .",
    "3(b ) for the definitions of abbreviations . here",
    "`` pm - g '' indicates the pm phase with enhanced @xmath84 spin correlation . ]",
    "now we focus our attention to the region ii , in which we can see the crossover in the orbital pattern between figs .  4(b ) and ( c ) . note that the crossover point is different from that between g- and a - type af phases observed in @xmath70 .",
    "this may be related to the appearance of two distinct transition temperatures of uga@xmath1 around at @xmath86.@xcite namely , one is related to ordering of spin and another is originating from orbital degree of freedom .",
    "an interesting point is that both orbital patterns , figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) , are antiferro - like in the basal plane .",
    "this may be detected in future by careful experiments .    in order to consider the spin and orbital structure of uranium compounds ,",
    "let us focus on the small-@xmath60 region . for @xmath60=0",
    ", we show @xmath70 as a function of @xmath59 in fig .",
    "5(a ) . in the pm region for small @xmath59 such as for @xmath59@xmath712 , there is no dominant component in @xmath70 , but for @xmath59@xmath722 , @xmath74 correlation gradually grows . the pm phase with dominant @xmath84 spin correlation is defined as `` pm - g '' in this paper . with further increasing @xmath59 ,",
    "eventually the ground state becomes g - type af insulating for @xmath59@xmath724 .    in the experimental results for ux@xmath1 ,",
    "when the lattice constant becomes large in the order of x = si , ge , sn , and pb , the system is changed from pauli paramagnetic to af metallic.@xcite for x = al , ga , in , and tl , a similar change has been reported .",
    "@xcite if we simply consider that the increase of the lattice constant leads to the decrease in the effective hopping , @xmath87 becomes large with the increase of the lattice constant .",
    "then , the present phase diagram in the small-@xmath60 region is consistent with the experimental results for ux@xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the orbital correlation as a function of @xmath59 is shown for @xmath60=0 . in the region corresponding to pm - g , both orbital patterns , figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) , are possible in principle , but we note that the pattern ( b ) appears for larger value of @xmath59 in the pm - g region near the g - af insulating phase .",
    "since uga@xmath1 is an af metal , it may be natural to consider that the orbital correlation corresponding to fig .",
    "4(b ) can be detected in actual compounds .",
    "note also that two types of orbital arrangement , figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) , should be distinguished by the structure along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "this point may be clarified in future experiments .",
    "after we have performed calculations for several parameter sets , the ground - state phase diagram is completed on the @xmath88 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "the pm phase exists for large parameter space and in the boundary region between pm and g - type af states , we can see the pm phase with dominant @xmath84 spin correlation .",
    "note that such a pm - g region is not specific to the case of @xmath60=0 , since it appears even when we increase the hund s rule interaction .",
    "here we briefly discuss the phases in the large-@xmath60 region .",
    "we observe an interesting similarity with the phase diagram for undoped manganites rmno@xmath1,@xcite in which mobile @xmath89-electrons are tightly coupled with the jahn - teller distortions and the background @xmath90 spins .",
    "note that the present hamiltonian is just equal to the @xmath89 electron part of the model for manganites.@xcite in the so - called double - exchange system with large hund s rule coupling between @xmath89 and @xmath90 electrons , the jahn - teller distortion suppresses the probability of double occupancy and it plays a similar role as the interorbital coulomb interaction @xmath59 .",
    "the af coupling among @xmath90 spins , @xmath91 , controls the fm tendency in the @xmath89-electron phases .",
    "roughly speaking , large ( small ) @xmath91 denotes small ( large ) @xmath60 .",
    "then , we see an interesting similarity between fig .",
    "5(c ) and the phase diagram for manganites , except for the pm region .",
    "especially , a chain of the transition , fm@xmath92a - af@xmath92c - af@xmath92g - af , occurs with decreasing @xmath60 ( increasing @xmath91 ) .",
    "again we stress that the present @xmath23 model for @xmath4-electron systems is essentially the same as the @xmath89 orbital model in the @xmath13-electron systems .",
    "it is interesting to observe common phenomena concerning orbital degree of freedom in @xmath4-electron systems .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "we have analyzed our model for the case of a cubic system in an effort to understand uga@xmath1 .",
    "our analysis has yielded a magnetic , metallic phase with antiferro - like orbital correlations , consistent with the experimental results . in order to extend this discussion to tetragonal systems such as umga@xmath0 ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce two new ingredients into the model hamiltonian .",
    "one is a non - zero value for @xmath55 , which is a level splitting between two of the orbitals . under a tetragonal cef",
    ", there are two @xmath21 levels and one @xmath93 . of these the @xmath93 state",
    "is the same as @xmath94 for the cubic system .",
    "the two @xmath21 states are given by linear combinations of the @xmath95=@xmath96 and @xmath97 states , which can also be expressed as an admixture of @xmath21 and @xmath98 .",
    "for simplicity , we introduce @xmath55 as a splitting energy between the @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "secondly , it is necessary to change the hopping amplitude along the @xmath3-axis . in umga@xmath0 ,",
    "the mga@xmath99 layer is sandwiched between two uga@xmath1 sheets , suggesting that the hopping amplitude of @xmath4-electrons along the @xmath3-axis should be reduced from that in uga@xmath1 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate this reduction quantitatively , since one must include correctly the hybridization with @xmath13-electrons in the transition metal ions and with @xmath44-electrons in the ga ions .",
    "thus , we manage the anticipated reduction by simply treating @xmath41 as a parameter .    in figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) , typical results for spin and orbital correlations are shown for @xmath100=0.8 , @xmath60=0 , and @xmath59=3.5 . for @xmath101@xmath1021 , a g - af phase",
    "is observed , since the hamiltonian is effectively reduced to a single - band model at half - filling , and the superexchange interaction stabilizes the g - af state .",
    "however , the a - af phase appears for @xmath103@xmath71@xmath55@xmath71@xmath104 near the orbitally degenerate region .",
    "the mechanism of the appearance of the a - af phase in the negative @xmath55 region will be discussed later , in terms of an orbital - based scenario . regarding the orbital structure , for @xmath101@xmath1021 , simple ferro - orbital ( fo ) ordered phases are obtained . in the narrow region",
    "where @xmath105@xmath71@xmath55@xmath71@xmath106 , we have identified an antiferro orbital ( afo ) pattern , as shown in fig .",
    "although the crossover point from an fo to an afo pattern deviates slightly from the a - af and g - af phase boundary , it is basically considered that the a - af phase appears in the region with an fo pattern .    in fig .",
    "6(c ) , we show the phase diagram in the @xmath107 plane for @xmath60=0 and @xmath59=3.5 , in which the ground state for @xmath55=0 and @xmath41=1 is magnetic metallic , as seen in fig .",
    "it is found that an a - type af phase appears in the negative @xmath55 region for @xmath41@xmath720.68 .",
    "note that the appearance of the a - af phase is not sensitive to @xmath41 as long as @xmath41@xmath720.68 .",
    "rather , @xmath55 seems to play a key role in controlling the change of the magnetic phase .",
    "here we recall the experimental fact that uniga@xmath0 exhibits a g - type af phase , while uptga@xmath0 shows an a - type.@xcite thus , it is necessary to relate the effect of @xmath55 to the difference in magnetic structure found between uniga@xmath0 and uptga@xmath0 .",
    "although @xmath41 may differ among u-115 compounds , we focus here on the effect of @xmath55 .     for @xmath41=0.8 , with @xmath60=0 and @xmath59=3.5 .",
    "( c ) phase diagram of the magnetic structure in the @xmath107 plane for @xmath60=0 and @xmath108 .",
    "( d ) ferro orbital pattern in the a - type af phase . ]",
    "let us now discuss the reasons for the appearance of an a - af phase . for negative values of @xmath55 , we easily obtain fo ordering composed of @xmath94 orbitals , as illustrated in fig",
    ".  6(d ) . for electrons to gain kinetic energy of motion along the @xmath3-axis ,",
    "it is necessary to place the af spin arrangement along this same axis . in the fm spin configuration",
    ", electrons can not move along the @xmath3-axis due to the pauli principle , since hopping occurs @xmath109 between @xmath94 orbitals along the @xmath3-axis . on the other hand , in the @xmath110 plane @xmath33-orbital electrons can hop to neighboring @xmath9-orbitals with a significant amplitude , which is larger than that between neighboring @xmath33-orbitals .",
    "thus , in order to gain kinetic energy , electrons tend to occupy @xmath9-orbitals even in the fo state composed of @xmath33-orbitals , as long as @xmath101 is not so large .",
    "when we explicitly include the effects of the hund s rule interaction @xmath60 , electron spins should have fm alignment between neighboring sites in order to gain energy in hopping processes from @xmath33- to @xmath9-orbitals .",
    "consequently , a fm spin configuration is favored in the @xmath110 plane .",
    "in fact , in spite of the fo state for @xmath103@xmath111@xmath55@xmath1110 , we can see a significant component of @xmath112 . in cases with antiferro orbital correlations",
    ", spin correlation tends in general to be fm , as has been widely recognized in orbitally degenerate systems .",
    "here we mention a relation of @xmath55 to the magnetic anisotropy in u-115 materials . for uptga@xmath0 with the a - af phase ,",
    "@xmath7 is larger than @xmath8 , whereas this anisotropy is not pronounced in uniga@xmath0 with the g - af phase.@xcite an analysis for the high - temperature region based on @xmath14 coupling yields the @xmath113=@xmath1141/2 kramers doublet as the ground state among the dectet of @xmath60=9/2 ( @xmath115=6 and @xmath116=3/2).@xcite the states with @xmath113=@xmath1141/2 in the @xmath14 coupling scheme have significant overlap with @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "accordingly , by the present definition @xmath55 should be negative to place @xmath94 below @xmath98 .",
    "if the absolute value of @xmath55(@xmath1110 ) becomes large , @xmath94 is well separated from @xmath98 and the magnetic anisotropy will consequently become large .",
    "thus , a change from g- to a - type af phase is consistent with the trends of magnetic anisotropy in uniga@xmath0 and uptga@xmath0 .",
    "finally , we make a brief comment about the effect of @xmath100 . following the above discussion",
    ", the a - af phase should appear even for small @xmath100 .",
    "however , in the persent calculation it disappears for @xmath100@xmath710.68 , a critical value which seems to be rather large .",
    "such a quantitative point depends on the system size , and we note that it is necessary to perform the calculation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a problem for future consideration .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a calculational model with active orbital degrees of freedom in an effort to understand the magnetic structure of uranium compounds from a microscopic point of view . in order to construct such a model ,",
    "we have incorporated the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , in which one - electron states are defined first , and coulomb interactions are included subsequently .",
    "this approach is consistent with the itinerant picture for @xmath4 electrons .",
    "by using an exact diagonalization technique , we have found a magnetic metallic phase with antiferro - like orbital correlations for uga@xmath1 and a change in the magnetic structure from g- to a - type af phases for umga@xmath0 .    in an effort to understand the magnetism and superconductivity of @xmath4-electron systems from a microscopic standpoint , we have carried out a study of an orbitally degenerate model .",
    "while such investigations are just beginning , we already see a number of opportunities for future work along this path . concerning issues directly related to the present paper",
    ", it is highly recommended that calculations be carried out in the thermodynamic limit , in order to confirm the present exact diagonalization results .",
    "for instance , the magnetic susceptibility should be evaluated in the random phase approximation or fluctuation - exchange method .",
    "with such an approach , the magnetic structure can be discussed by detecting the divergence in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this is one of our future tasks .",
    "another problem is how to establish the effective reduction of @xmath100 in considering the case of umga@xmath0 . in such systems ,",
    "mga@xmath99 sheets are interspersed between uga@xmath1 layers , but the main process may occur through the ga ions.@xcite to analyse this , it is necessary to treat a three - dimensional @xmath4-@xmath44 model with explicit consideration of u and ga ions .",
    "this is another problem for future investigation .",
    "we comment briefly on the cef levels of 115 compounds . in this paper , we have considered the umga@xmath0 systems by introducing a splitting energy @xmath55 between @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "this procedure did not include changes in the basis wavefunctions . nonetheless , in following the present strategy , a better way to consider u-115 might be to accommodate three electrons in the cef levels of ce-115 . regarding the latter systems , there are some interesting results in the literature . in analyses of the susceptibility and specific heat , @xcite for example",
    ", the ground level has been considered to be @xmath119 , consistent with @xmath7@xmath111@xmath8 in ce-115 , and the first excited level has been suggested to be @xmath120 , not @xmath93 . regarding cerhin@xmath0 ,",
    "neutron scattering experiments have been performed in spite of the inclusion of indium , @xcite identifying energy levels in the sequence @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath93 , in agreement with previous analyses.@xcite if we simply put three electrons into the cef levels of cerhin@xmath0 , assuming hund s rule coupling to be small , it may be difficult to understand the appearance of a - type af phases , since @xmath55 becomes positive within the level scheme of ce-115 .    a simple way to understand such",
    "a discrepancy is to remark that ce-115 contains in and m = co , ir , and rh , while the u-115 considered here contains ga and m = ni , pd , and pt .",
    "different ions lead to different effects on the level scheme .",
    "in fact , the magnetic anisotropy of ucoga@xmath0 ( pauli paramagnet ) is small compared with that of uniga@xmath0 , and @xmath8 is slightly larger than @xmath7 . in ufega@xmath0 , which is also a pauli paramagnet ,",
    "we have found that @xmath7@xmath111@xmath8 , opposite to what is observed in uniga@xmath0 and uptga@xmath0 . we envisage that in umga@xmath0",
    ", @xmath55 is positive for m = fe , slightly positive for m = co , and negative for m = ni .",
    "moreover , @xmath101 increases in the sequence @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 transition metal ions , consistent with the magnetic anisotropy .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed an orbitally degenerate model appropriate for uga@xmath1 and umga@xmath0 using an exact diagonalization technique .",
    "what we have found is a magnetic metallic phase with antiferro - like orbital correlations . by introducing tetragonal effects such as level splitting and a reduced hopping amplitude along @xmath3-axis",
    ", we have reproduced the change in the spin structure from g- to a - type af phases , corresponding to uniga@xmath0 and uptga@xmath0 .",

    "this work has been supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research from japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "the computation in this work has been partly done using the facilities of the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo",
    "in this appendix , we examine a local @xmath4-electron state based on the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , comparing it with that obtained from the @xmath14 coupling scheme and from experimental results . concerning the level scheme for the @xmath121 electron state , we consider two cases .",
    "first , we consider the aucu@xmath1-type cubic crystal structure with one @xmath4 electron per site .",
    "as already mentioned in the main text , a typical material is cein@xmath1 , in which @xmath21 and @xmath23 are the ground and first excited states , respectively,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "if we accommodate one more electron to consider the @xmath122 configuration , immediately there appear two possibilities , `` low '' and `` high''-spin states .",
    "when the cef splitting energy between @xmath21 and @xmath23 levels is smaller than the hund s rule coupling , the second electron should be accommodated in the @xmath23 levels . in the situation",
    "in which one is in the @xmath21 and the other in the @xmath23 , a @xmath123 or @xmath124 triplet appears for the @xmath122 state in general , but under special conditions , a @xmath125 doublet can occur . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cef splitting is larger than the hund s rule interaction , then the @xmath122 ground state is formed from two @xmath21 electrons , leading to a @xmath126 state .",
    "when we compare this @xmath126 state with that in the @xmath14 coupling scheme , we notice that it is given by a mixture of @xmath60=0 and @xmath60=4 states , but the @xmath60=4 component is found to be dominant .",
    "note also that @xmath126 is the antisymmetric representation of @xmath127 .    since we do not know the exact value of the hund s rule interaction in @xmath4-electron compounds , it is difficult to determine the @xmath122 state by purely theoretical arguments . in this case",
    ", we have to refer to data on actual materials .",
    "fortunately , we have the example of prin@xmath1 , a typical @xmath122 material with aucu@xmath1-type crystal structure . from several experimental results ,",
    "@xmath126 has been confirmed to be the ground level in prin@xmath1.@xcite thus , the low - spin state should be taken for the aucu@xmath1-type structure in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .      here",
    "the reader may pose a naive question : is the hund s rule interaction really that small in @xmath4-electron systems ?",
    "we have already had to answer this question in a previous paper.@xcite in a word , we are considering the effective hund s rule interaction in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , not in the @xmath14 coupling scheme .",
    "the original form for the hund s rule interaction is written as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 denotes the operator for the `` real '' @xmath4-electron spin at site @xmath29 and @xmath130 is the hund s rule interaction among @xmath4 electrons in @xmath131=3 orbitals . in order to transfer this to the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme , it is convenient to use the well - known relation @xmath132=@xmath133@xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the land s @xmath136-factor and @xmath137 is the operator for the total angular momentum of @xmath2=5/2 at site @xmath29 . from standard textbooks ,",
    "we easily obtain @xmath135=6/7 , indicating that @xmath132=@xmath138 .",
    "thus , the hund s rule term in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme is rewritten as @xmath139 with @xmath140=@xmath141 .",
    "note then that the magnitude of the hund s rule interaction is effectively reduced by the factor 1/49 in the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme . even if @xmath130=1ev , @xmath140 is reduced to be about 200k , which is comparable with the cef splitting energy .",
    "thus , it is possible to have the low - spin state in the @xmath2-@xmath2 couping scheme .",
    "next , we take a further step to the @xmath142 state by adding one more @xmath4 electron .",
    "since @xmath21 is fully occupied to form @xmath126 , the next electron should be placed in the @xmath23 state as shown in fig .",
    "7(c ) , clearly indicating that there exists an active orbital degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath142 state composed of two @xmath21 and one @xmath23 electron is expressed as @xmath143 in the terminology of group theory .",
    "when we again consider actual materials , ndin@xmath1 is found to be a typical @xmath142 material with the aucu@xmath1-type crystal structure . in experiments ,",
    "it has been established that @xmath143 is the ground level,@xcite as we have found with the present @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "let us turn our attention to another crystal structure in which @xmath23 is lower than @xmath21 in the @xmath121 configuration .",
    "typical materials are the rare - earth hexaborides rb@xmath144 with r = ce , pr , and nd .",
    "as is well known , the ground level of ceb@xmath144 is @xmath23 , indicating that the quadrupolar degree of freedom plays an active role in this material.@xcite in fact , anomalous behavior related to quadrupolar ordering has been suggested by several exeprimental results .",
    "first , we note that the level splitting between @xmath23 and @xmath21 is assumed to be larger than the hund s rule interaction .",
    "when we accommodate two electrons in @xmath23 orbitals , the triplet ( @xmath124 ) , doublet ( @xmath125 ) , and singlet ( @xmath126 ) states are allowed . among these , owing to the effect of the hund s rule interaction , even if it is small , the @xmath124 triplet should be the ground state .",
    "this has actually been observed in prb@xmath144.@xcite further , in order to consider ndb@xmath144 , yet another electron is put into the @xmath23 orbital , making a total of three .",
    "alternatively , we may say that there is one hole in the @xmath23 orbital .",
    "such a state is found , again , to be characterized by @xmath143 .",
    "experimental results on ndb@xmath144 have actually been reported which lead to the ground state of @xmath143.@xcite thus , when @xmath23 is the ground state for the one @xmath4-electron case , we obtain @xmath124 for the @xmath122 and @xmath143 for the @xmath142 configurations .",
    "we have shown that the ground states deduced from the @xmath2-@xmath2 couping scheme are consistent with experimental results . however , in order to explain the experimental results quantitatively , it is unavoidable to analyze the cef levels using the @xmath14 coupling scheme .",
    "what we would like to stress is that even in a localized system , the symmetry of the ground level can be understood via the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "we need to recognize the limitations of the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme when we treat a local electronic state .",
    "for instance , to consider the @xmath142 state , we simply put three electrons into the cef level scheme which is determined with the @xmath121 configuration .",
    "thus , the wavefunction of the @xmath142 state is uniquely determined .",
    "however , in an actual situation , the dectet labelled by @xmath60=9/2 ( @xmath115=6 and @xmath116=3/2 ) is split into two @xmath23 and one @xmath93 orbital .",
    "the ground - state wavefunctions will then depend on the two cef parameters @xmath24 and @xmath145.@xcite as mentioned above , in order to explain experimental results on localized @xmath4-electron materials , ones should analyze the cef effects in the system using the @xmath14 coupling scheme . in this paper , however , the electronic states are considered with an itinerant picture based on the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
    "thus , it is important to check that the local electronic state formed by @xmath4 electrons in this way is consistent with the symmetry of the state obtained with the @xmath14 coupling scheme .    in summary",
    ", it has been shown that the ground states of the @xmath122 and @xmath142 configurations can be qualitatively reproduced by accommodating @xmath4 electrons in the cef levels of a corresponding @xmath121 material , provided that the cef level splitting is larger than the hund s rule interaction .",
    "thus , the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme works even in the localized case .",
    "accordingly , we believe that a microscopic theory can be developed in which we discuss the magnetism and superconductivity of @xmath4-electron compounds in terms of the @xmath2-@xmath2 coupling scheme .",
