    "the paradigm of the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) of relativistic particles ( krymsky @xcite , axford et al .",
    "@xcite , bell @xcite , blandford & ostriker @xcite ) is generally accepted as the most likely scenario of production of galactic cosmic rays ( cr ) in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . over the last 30 years a significant progress has been achieved in the development of theoretical models and understanding of the basic features of dsa ( see e.g. malkov & drury @xcite for a review ) . on the other hand , the recent detailed studies of spectral and morphological features of young snrs , first of all in the x - ray and very - high - energy or tev gamma - ray band , provide excellent observational material for development of detailed numerical models of acceleration and radiation of relativistic electrons and protons in young snrs .",
    "these observations generally confirm in general terms the predictions of dsa .",
    "in particular the synchrotron x - radiation observed from many young snrs implies an existence of multi - tev energy electrons which is naturally explained by dsa .",
    "the detection of tev gamma - rays from snrs , like cas  a , rx j1713.7 - 3946 , vela jr .",
    ", rcw  86 ( see aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) give a more direct and unambiguous information about the effective acceleration of particles , electrons and/or protons , in snrs to energies exceeding 100 tev . in spite of the high quality data obtained from these snrs and intensive theoretical and phenomenological studies",
    ", we can not yet firmly distinguish between two competing processes of gamma - ray production : the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the background electromagnetic radiation by accelerated electrons ( leptonic model ) or a decay of neutral pions , mainly produced by accelerating protons during the interaction with the gas of the remnant ( hadronic model ) .",
    "it should be noted that this ambiguity concerns the interpretation of the origin of gamma - rays , rather than the question of acceleration of protons in general .",
    "the presence of multi - tev electrons in the snr shells most likely implies also acceleration of protons - not only because the dsa operates identically for both electrons and protons ; the presence of larger amount of nonthermal protons is needed in any case for production of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the vicinity of a supernova shock . this is a necessary condition for effective acceleration of particles via dsa ( see malkov & drury @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in this paper we conduct detailed study acceleration of electrons and protons with an emphasis on the spectral and morphological features of high energy radiation produced by these particles in young supernova remnants . for that purpose",
    "we use a new numerical code of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration developed by one of us in collaboration with v. ptuskin ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) .",
    "this model can be considered as a natural development of existing numerical codes ( see e.g. berezhko et al.@xcite , kang et al @xcite ) , with new additional elements which despite their strong impact on the overall picture of acceleration in general , and on the properties of high energy radiation of snrs in particular , have been ignored in the past .",
    "namely , in our treatment , the solution of spherically symmetric hydrodynamic equations is combined with the energetic particle transport and acceleration by the _",
    "forward _ shock ( fs ) and _ reverse _ shock ( rs ) .",
    "nonlinear response of energetic particles via their pressure gradient results in self - regulation of acceleration efficiency . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first study in which the modification of the reverse shock and the nonthermal radiation related to the reverse shock is taken into account .",
    "the detailed calculations of radio , x - ray , gamma - ray emission components conducted within a self - consistent treatment of particle acceleration by both forward and reverse shocks allows direct comparison of the observed spectral and morphological features with the model predictions .",
    "the inclusion of the radiation components related to the reverse shock seems to us a rather obligatory condition , given the effective acceleration of particles at the reverse shock to very high energies , as it is demonstrated in this paper . in this",
    "regard we note that the parameters characterizing the reverse shock can be significantly different in comparison with the parameters at the forward shock . as a result",
    ", the properties of radiation components from the reverse and forward shocks can be also significantly different .",
    "in particular the density of plasma and the magnetic field in the reverse shock can be very low which would dramatically increase the contribution of the ic component compared to the hadronic ( @xmath0-decay ) component of gamma - rays . because of the higher gas density and stronger magnetic field , in the forward shock one may expect an opposite relation between the contributions of the electrons and protons to the high energy gamma - radiation .",
    "the results of this study have a general character and can be applied to different young snrs . in order to demonstrate their astrophysical implication , in this paper we apply the model to the supernova remnant rx j1713.7 - 3946 -",
    "the brightest and best studied tev gamma - ray source among known shell - type supernova remnants ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the high quality gamma - ray and x - ray images and energy spectra available for this source make it a kind of template source for theoretical studies . on the other hand , this source have quite unusual radiation features ( e.g. a lack of thermal x - radiation , a very low intensity of the synchrotron radio emission , etc . )",
    "so the conclusions derived for this source can not be directly extended to other snrs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the observational information about the supernova remnant rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the short description of the model and basic features of accelerated particles is given in section 3 .",
    "the results of modeling of the broad - band emission radiation produced in hadronic and leptonic scenarios are presented and discussed in sections 4 , 5 and 6 . in section 7",
    "we compare the magnetic field amplification and the maximum particle energies achieved in forward and reverse shocks . finally , in sections 8 and 9 we discuss and summarize the obtained results .",
    "the shell - type snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 was discovered in x - rays during the rosat all - sky survey ( pfeffermann & aschenbach @xcite ) .",
    "the following observations of asca , chandra , xmm - newton and suzaku ( koyama et al .",

    "@xcite , hiraga et al .",
    "@xcite , takahashi et al .",
    "@xcite , tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite ) revealed that the x - ray emission predominantly consists of the synchrotron component without an indication of a thermal x - ray component at the level of sensitivity of these instruments .",
    "the suzaku measurements ( tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite ) allowed accurate derivation of the broad - band x - ray spectrum of the source over two energy decades , from 0.4 kev to 40 kev .",
    "it is described by a power - law with a photon index @xmath1 and a smooth cut - off around a few kev .",
    "the remnant is close to the position of the guest star ad393 described in the ancient chinese records ( wang et al.@xcite ) .",
    "if this not an accidental coincidence , the age of the remnant should be close to 1600 years .    using the association of the supernova remnant with nearby molecular clouds , different estimates of the distance to the source",
    "have been suggested : @xmath2 kpc ( slane et al .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath3 kpc ( fukui et al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath4 kpc ( cassam - chena et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the remnant was claimed to be detected in gamma - rays by the cangaroo collaboration ( muraishi et al .",
    "later , the observation with the hess array of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes revealed indeed a bright tev gamma - ray source with a shell - type morphology quite similar to the synchrotron x - ray image of the source ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) the energy spectrum measured over the interval from 0.3 tev to 100 tev is hard ; it is characterized by a photon index @xmath5 with a break or a cutoff around 10 tev ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the remnant is rather faint in radio .",
    "the recent atca measurements at 1.4 ghz gave the radio - intensity @xmath6 jy from the whole remnant ( acero et al .",
    "the radio and x - ray images clearly show also an inner shell ( ellison et al .",
    "@xcite , lazendic et al .",

    "@xcite , hiraga et al .",
    "@xcite , acero et al .",
    "@xcite ) with an angular diameter 0.5 degrees while the angular diameter of the remnant is close to one degree .",
    "the inner shell in the radio and x - ray images can be naturally attributed to the reverse shock propagating in the supernova ejecta , assuming that the electrons are accelerated also at the reverse shock .",
    "this is likely to be the case of the supernova remnant cas a ( helder & vink @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the reverse shock is not treated as an efficient accelerator , because the magnetic field of ejecta might be very weak due to the large expansion factor of the exploded star .",
    "however , similar to the case of the forward shock , the magnetic field can be significantly amplified also at the reverse shock ( see ellison et al .",
    "@xcite ) , for example , in the course of the nonresonant streaming instability introduced by bell @xcite . another probable explanation of the inner shell could be its association with a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "it is known that an active pulsar may produce a corresponding nebula in an expanding supernova ejecta ( chevalier @xcite ) .",
    "the inner shell does contain the radio pulsar psr j1713 - 3945 with a period @xmath7 ms , but the latter is located at a distance @xmath8 kpc .",
    "also , the pulsar s current spin - down luminosity does not exceed @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "this power is too low to produce the inner shell.the shell contains also a central compact object 1wga j1713.4 - 3949 which is presumably a neutron star related to the remnant ( lazendic et al .",

    "hydrodynamical equations for the gas density @xmath11 , gas velocity @xmath12 , gas pressure @xmath13 , and the equation for the quasi - isotropic cr momentum distribution @xmath14 in the spherically symmetrical case are given by    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the cr pressure , @xmath22 is the advective velocity of crs , @xmath23 is the adiabatic index of the gas and @xmath24 is the cr diffusion coefficient .",
    "it was assumed that the diffusive streaming of crs results in the generation of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves .",
    "cr particles are scattered by these waves .",
    "that is why the cr advective velocity @xmath25 may differ from the gas velocity @xmath26 .",
    "damping of these waves results in an additional gas heating .",
    "it is described by the last term in eq .",
    "two last terms in eq .",
    "( 4 ) correspond to the injection of thermal protons with momenta @xmath27 , @xmath28 and mass @xmath29 at the fronts of the forward and reverse shocks at @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 determine the corresponding injection efficiency .",
    "the pressure of energetic electrons is neglected , i.e. the electrons are treated as test particles .",
    "the evolution of electron distribution is described by an equation similar to eq.(4 ) , but with additional terms describing synchrotron and ic losses .",
    "cr diffusion is determined by magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "strong streaming of accelerated particles changes medium properties in the shock vicinity .",
    "in particular , the cr streaming instability in young snrs results in a high level of mhd turbulence ( bell @xcite ) and even in amplification of magnetic field ( bell @xcite ) . due to this effect the protons can be accelerated to energies beyond the the so - called lagage and cesarsky limit , @xmath34  tev ( lagage & cesarsky @xcite ) .    according to the recent numerical modeling of this instability , the magnetic field",
    "is amplified by the flux of run - away highest energy particles in the relatively broad region upstream of the shock ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic energy density is a small fraction ( @xmath35 ) of the energy density of accelerated particles .",
    "this amplified almost isotropic magnetic field can be considered as a large - scale magnetic field for lower energy particles which are concentrated in the narrow region upstream of the shock . streaming instability of these particles produces mhd waves propagating in the direction opposite to the cr gradient .",
    "this gradient is negative upstream of the forward shock and mhd waves propagate in the positive direction .",
    "we apply a finite - difference method to solve numerically eqs .",
    "( 1 - 4 ) upstream and downstream of the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "the auto - model variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 are used instead of the radius @xmath38 upstream of the forward shock at @xmath39 and upstream of the reverse shock at @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the gases compressed at forward and reverse shocks are separated by a contact discontinuity ( cd ) at @xmath41 that is situated between the shocks .",
    "we use variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 instead of @xmath38 between the shocks downstream of the forward and reverse shocks , respectively .",
    "a non - uniform numerical grid upstream of the shocks at @xmath39 and @xmath40 allows to resolve small scales of hydrodynamical quantities appearing due to the pressure gradient of low - energy crs .",
    "( 4 ) for crs was solved using an implicit finite - difference scheme .",
    "an explicit conservative tvd scheme ( trac & pen @xcite ) for hydrodynamical equations ( 1 - 3 ) and uniform spatial grid were used between the shocks .",
    "these equations are solved in the upstream regions using an implicit finite - difference scheme .",
    "the magnetic field plays no dynamical role in the model .",
    "since we do not model the amplification and transport of magnetic field here , its coordinate dependence should be specified for determination of cosmic ray diffusion and for calculation of synchrotron emission and losses .",
    "we shall assume below that the coordinate dependencies of the magnetic field and the gas density coincide upstream and downstream of the forward shock : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the gas density of the circumstellar medium .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is similar to the alfvn much number of the shock and determines the value of the amplified magnetic field strength .",
    "the magnetic energy downstream of the shock is estimated to be several percents of the dynamical pressure @xmath47 as was derived from the width of x - ray filaments in young snrs ( vlk et al .",
    "the characteristic range of this parameter is @xmath48 .",
    "for example , the energy of the magnetic field of about 3.5 percent of the dynamical pressure ( vlk et al .",
    "@xcite ) and characteristic compression ratio of a modified shock @xmath49 correspond to @xmath50 .",
    "since the plasma density @xmath51 decreases towards the contact discontinuity downstream of the forward shock , the same is true for the magnetic field strength according to eq .",
    "this seems reasonable because of a possible magnetic dissipation in this region .",
    "situation is different downstream of the reverse shock at @xmath52 .",
    "the plasma flow is as a rule strongly influenced by the rayleigh - taylor instability that occurs in the vicinity of the contact discontinuity and results in generation of mhd turbulence in this region .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field does not depend on radius downstream of the reverse shock while the dependence in the upstream region is described by the equation similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) :    @xmath53 @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the radius where the ejecta density has a minimum and equals @xmath56 .",
    "this radius @xmath57 is generally close to the reverse shock radius @xmath58 and is equal to it if the reverse shock is not modified by the cosmic ray pressure .",
    "cr advective velocity may differ from the gas velocity on the value of the radial component of the alfvn velocity @xmath59 calculated in the isotropic random magnetic field : @xmath60 .",
    "here the factor @xmath61 describes the possible deviation of the cosmic ray drift velocity from the gas velocity . using eq .",
    "( 5 ) we obtain @xmath62 the similar expression for the cosmic ray drift velocity is used upstream of the reverse shock at @xmath40 .",
    "we use values @xmath63 and @xmath64 upstream of the forward and reverse shocks respectively , where alfvn waves are generated by the cosmic ray streaming instability and propagate in the corresponding directions .",
    "the damping of these waves heats the gas upstream of the shocks ( see mckenzie & vlk @xcite ) and limits the total compression ratios by a number close to 6 . in the downstream region of the forward and reverse shock at @xmath65 we put @xmath66 and therefore @xmath67 .",
    "here we use the energy dependence of the cr diffusion coefficient like in the case of bohm diffusion : @xmath68 calculated for the magnetic field radial dependencies given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 describes the possible deviations of diffusion coefficient from the one achieved in the regime of bohm diffusion , @xmath70 .",
    "since the highest energy particles are scattered by small - scale magnetic fields , their diffusion is faster than the bohm diffusion ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) .",
    "the same is true for low energy particles because they can be resonantly scattered only by a fraction of the magnetic spectrum . throughout the paper",
    "we use the value @xmath71 .",
    "in real situations the level of mhd turbulence drops with distance upstream of the shock , so the diffusion could be quite fast there .",
    "the characteristic diffusive scale of highest energy particles is a small fraction @xmath72 of the shock radius ( see zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) and is determined by the generation and transport of mhd turbulence in the upstream region ( see also vladimirov et al .",
    "@xcite , amato & blasi @xcite ) .",
    "the value @xmath73 is determined by ratio of diffusion coefficient @xmath74 in the circumstellar medium and diffusion coefficient @xmath75 in the vicinity of the shock .",
    "the mhd turbulence is amplified exponentially in time before the shock arrival from the background level by cosmic ray streaming instability . since",
    "this process is not modelled here , we simply multiply the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath76 to the additional factor @xmath77 upstream of the forward shock and to a similar factor @xmath78 upstream of the reverse shock .",
    "the characteristic range of @xmath79 is @xmath80 ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed that the supernova ejecta has some velocity distribution @xmath81 just after the supernova explosion ( e.g. chevalier @xcite ) @xmath82 here the index @xmath83 characterizes the steep power - low part of this distribution .",
    "the radial distribution of ejecta density is described by the same expression with @xmath84 .",
    "the characteristic ejecta velocity @xmath85 can be expressed in terms of energy of supernova explosion @xmath86 and ejecta mass @xmath87 as    @xmath88    figures 1 - 5 illustrate the numerical results that are obtained for the snr shock propagating in the medium with hydrogen number density @xmath89 @xmath90 and temperature @xmath91 k. the number density of helium nuclei @xmath92 was assumed .",
    "we use the ejecta mass @xmath93 , the energy of explosion @xmath94 erg and the parameter of ejecta velocity distribution @xmath95 .",
    "these combination of these parameters is chosen to explain the obtained gamma - ray fluxes within the hadronic model of gamma - rays ( see next section ) .",
    "the initial forward shock velocity is @xmath96 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the injection efficiency is taken to be independent of time @xmath97 , and the injection momenta are @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the high injection efficiency results in significant shock modification already at early epochs of the snr expansion while the thermal sub - shock compression ratio is close to 2.5 .",
    "this is in agreement with calculations of collisionless shocks ( zirakashvili @xcite ) and are supported by radio - observations of young extragalactic snrs ( chevalier @xcite ) . in hadronic models of gamma - radiation of rx j1713.7 - 3946",
    "the ratio of relativistic electrons to protons @xmath100 appears significantly lower compared to the observed ratio for galactic cosmic rays which is around 0.01 at 10 gev .",
    "a possible explanation could be the dependence of the electron injection efficiency on the shock speed . in the paper",
    "we assume that the electron injection is inversely proportional to the square of the shock speed .",
    "then the electron to proton ratio @xmath101 for a characteristic shock speed 3000 km s@xmath10 of young snrs corresponds to @xmath102 in the old snrs with a characteristic shock speed 300 km s@xmath10 .",

    "the distance between reverse and forward shocks is only 10@xmath114 of the remnant radius .",
    "note that the automodel chevalier - nadezhin solution with @xmath95 predicts 23@xmath114 thickness ( chevalier @xcite ) .",
    "this can be attributed to the strong modification of both shocks by cr pressure .",
    "the reverse shock is strongly decelerated only when the forward shock sweeps the gas mass comparable to the ejecta mass at @xmath115 yr and when the transition to the sedov phase begins .",
    "it is important that the observable ratio @xmath116 is achieved at the sedov phase when the forward shock speed is close to 1/3 of the characteristic ejecta speed @xmath85 .",
    "since the synchrotron x - ray emission of snr rx  j1713.7 - 3946 extends well beyond 1 kev , the present forward shock speed can not be significantly less than @xmath117 km s@xmath10 .",

    "the nonthermal emission of snrs can not be treated out of the context of thermal emission . in particular , any standard hadronic model of gamma - rays",
    "predicts heating of the gas to high temperatures with intense x - ray emission .",
    "the lack of such emission from the most pronounced tev emitting snr , rx j1713.7 - 3946 , can be interpreted as an argument against the hadronic models of gamma - rays ( katz & waxman @xcite ) or an evidence of extremely high efficiency of transformation of the kinetic energy of explosion to acceleration of relativistic particles ( drury et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "though our numerical calculation show that in the hadronic models of gamma - rays the thermal bremsstrahlung appears to be an order of magnitude below the suzaku x - ray data ( see figs 6 and 7 ) , the actual flux of x - ray emission in this energy range is higher due to the contribution from the line x - ray emission ( see e.g. ellison et al .",
    "the latter strongly depends on the chemical composition of the x - ray emitting plasma . for the composition similar to one observed in the sun",
    ", the intensity of x - ray lines can significantly exceed the free - free continuum ( see ellison et al .",
    "this means that such lines must be observed contrary to x - ray data .",
    "based on this fact , cassam - chena et al .",
    "@xcite derived an upper limit on the ambient plasma density @xmath198 @xmath90 .",
    "this value is several times lower than @xmath132 @xmath90 in the hadronic models considered in this paper .",
    "a simplest explanation of this could be that chemical composition of the circumstellar gas is strongly different from the solar one e.g. due to absorption of x - ray line emitting ions by dust grains .",
    "we should note that the thermal x - ray emission may be strongly depressed at the supernova shocks that are very strongly modified by the cosmic ray pressure when the shock compression ratio @xmath199 . in this case",
    "only a small part of dissipating energy is transferred to the thermal plasma and the gas temperature may be below 0.1 kev even under the electron - ion thermal equilibrium ( drury et al .",
    "@xcite ) however such compression ratios are not observed in our model .",
    "the strong heating of the upstream plasma due to the damping of alfvn waves results in the modest shock modification with @xmath200 .",
    "even if one assumes that the waves are not damped and the gas heating is negligible , the wave pressure will be high and it will also prevent the strong shock modification ( see caprioli et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "very high compression ratios are possible at radiative shocks in a high density plasma where the waves are damped and the gas loses energy radiatively .    another possibility to explain a low thermal x - ray luminosity of the remnant is related with a nonuniform circumstellar medium .",
    "chandra observations reveal a complex network of non - steady bright spots and filaments inside the x - ray emitting shell ( uchiyama et al .",
    "@xcite ) . if dense filaments with a small volume factor exist already in the circumstellar medium and determine the mean density of the plasma , say 1 @xmath90 , they will not be shocked by the snr shock coming and the mean density of the shocked material will be rather low say 0.01 @xmath90 . however the plasma density `` seen '' by tev accelerated protons can be close to the total mean value because of the relatively fast diffusion . as a result they will be able to produce tev gamma - ray with a flux close to the observed one",
    ". an enhanced magnetic field inside the filaments may also produce the observed x - ray variability of bright spots ( uchiyama et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "an interesting consequence of this scenario is that the gamma - ray intensity at low energies can be reduced because of the slow diffusion of gev protons which prevents their effective penetration into the dense filaments . as a result ,",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum due to p - p interactions can be quite similar to the ic gamma - ray spectra expected in leptonic models .",
    "this possibility makes quite difficult the identification of the origin of gamma - radiation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the thermal x - rays produced in the gas shocked by the forward shock are rare observed in young supernova remnants . for example , the thermal x - ray emission of the supernova remnants tycho and sn1006 is produced by shocked ejecta that is enriched by heavy elements ( cassam - chena et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in this regard",
    "the snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 perhaps is not a very special example .",
    "it is at a later evolutionary phase in comparison with snrs mentioned above , so the ejecta is situated deeply inside and has a very low density ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this could be the reason why the thermal x - ray emission of ejecta is not observed .",
    "on the other hand , the thermal emission from the downstream region of the forward shock is not detected similar to many other young snrs .",
    "the young remnant rcw 86 is well known source with thermal x - ray line emission observed from the forward shock ( see yamaguchi et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this remnant the chemical abundance of heavy ions downstream of the forward shock seems indeed below the solar one .      the comparison of figs .",
    "6&7 with figs .",
    "8&9 shows that the spectral shape of gamma - emission is better reproduced in hadronic models .",
    "however the difference perhaps is not sufficient for a definite conclusion concerning the origin of gamma - radiation radiation based on the current data .",
    "the spectra predicted by two models deviate significantly at very high ( @xmath201  tev ) and low @xmath202  gev energies .",
    "the first energy domain can be explored with the next generation ground - based detectors with significantly improved sensitivity compared to hess . in particular",
    ", the confirmation of the the last spectral points above 30 tev reported by hess with limited statistical significance , would be a strong argument in favor of the hadronic origin of gamma - rays .",
    "also , the hadronic model predicts gamma - ray flux below 100 gev at the level of @xmath203 , while the ic gamma - ray flux predicted by the leptonic model around 1 gev is closer to @xmath204 .",
    "it is expected that the measurements conducted with the agile and fermi telescopes will soon provide a decisive answer for the mev / gev flux from rxj  1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the detection of a signal close to @xmath205 would imply hadronic origin of radiation . on the other hand",
    ", the much lower flux would favor the ic origin of radiation but still could not reject the hadronic origin , given that gamma - rays could be produced in dense filaments .",
    "as discussed above , because of slow diffusion of low energy protons that prevents their effective penetration into the filaments , the gev emission from p - p interactions in the dense filaments could be suppressed .",
    "this model can also give a reasonable , in our view , explanation of the lack of thermal x - ray line emission .",
    "we should note , however , that the real picture could be more complex , in particular we may expect non - negligible deviations of energy spectra because of non - spherical geometry , different shock properties at different parts of the shock surface , _",
    "etc_. moreover , one may expect comparable contributions of gamma - rays from interactions of both accelerated protons and electrons , but produced in different proportions in different regions of the remnant ( see below ) . in this regard ,",
    "detailed spectroscopic measurements of gamma - rays from different parts of the remnant seem to be a key towards understanding of acceleration processes which take place in this source .",
    "if the magnetic field is indeed as high as required in hadronic models , we should expect , according to fig.10 , thin filaments with a width of about @xmath206 in the remnant periphery .",
    "the linear filaments are indeed present at chandra image ( uchiyama et al .",
    "@xcite , lazendic et al .",
    "@xcite ) but in the vicinity of the inner ring that might be related to the reverse shock .",
    "this agrees with fig.10 - 12 . the most recent x - ray image of xmm - newton ( acero et al .",
    "@xcite ) shows several linear filaments with the width @xmath207 present in this image , but they all are situated inside the boundary of the x - ray emission .",
    "the boundary itself is not sharp that is presumably related with a nonuniform circumstellar medium .",
    "the lack of sharp x - ray boundary is better explained by leptonic models . according to fig.11 and fig.12",
    "some amount of x - rays is expected from the region located beyond the forward shock . in the leptonic model it is possible because accelerated electrons have sufficiently high energies to produce synchrotron x - rays in the low magnetic field .",
    "the gamma - ray radial distributions predicted by hadronic models are sharper than the distributions calculated within the leptonic models ( see fig.13 ) . however , because of limited angular resolution of gamma - ray telescopes , it is not possible , unfortunately , to distinguish between the distributions predicted by two models .",
    "it is demonstrated in fig.13 in which the profiles are smoothed with a typical for cherenkov telescope arrays point spread function assuming gaussian distribution with @xmath208 .",
    "both smoothed profiles reasonably agree with the angular distribution of tev gamma - rays as measured by hess .",
    "an improvement of the angular resolution of future detectors by a factor of two should allow identification of the origin of the parent particles .",
    "on the other hand , this can be done with current detectors like hess , veritas and magic , for a young nearby snr with a larger angular size . in this regard , the young supernova remnant vela jr ( rx j0852.0 - 4622 ) with gamma - ray properties quite similar to rx j1713.7 - 3946 as reported by hess ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but with angular diameter @xmath209 , is a promising object for such studies .",
    "the observed ratio of the forward shock radius to the reverse shock radius robustly constraints the type of supernova explosion that produced snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 . for reasonable values of the energy of supernova explosion @xmath210 erg ,",
    "the ejecta mass must be small , @xmath211 , otherwise the forward shock speed would be too low for production of synchrotron radiation extended to hard x - ray domain .",
    "such small ejecta masses correspond to ib / c or iib core collapse supernova ( chevalier @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar medium around these types of supernova is created by the stellar wind of the supernova progenitor",
    ". it may be a low density ( @xmath212 @xmath90 ) bubble created by stellar wind of progenitor during the main sequence period of the star evolution or by a stellar wind of a wolf - rayet progenitor .",
    "because of very low densities , the observed gamma - rays can be produced only via ic scattering of electrons .",
    "if the bubble is created during the red supergiant stage of the supernova progenitor or during the interaction of the slow red supergiant wind with the fast wolf - rayet wind , the gas density could be sufficiently high for effective production of gamma - rays at interactions of accelerated protons .    in all models",
    "considered the forward shock of snr have swept only 6 - 15@xmath213 .",
    "this mass is comparable or slightly less than the mass ejected by progenitors of ib / c and iib supernova during the stellar evolution .",
    "this means that the shock just have swept the progenitor s material ejected during the stellar evolution .",
    "the interaction with the molecular gas surrounding the remnant only starts",
    ". the exceptions could be the very dense cores of molecular gas ( clouds c and d ) that are situated already inside the forward shock ( fukui @xcite ) .",
    "probably the forward shock has enveloped the clouds , and a high pressure gas from the downstream region drove secondary shocks into the clouds ( see chevalier @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these shocks are strongly decelerated and become radiative .",
    "that is why they do not produce the thermal x - rays ( see also cassam - chena et al .",
    "the nonthermal x - rays can be produced at these shocks by high - energy electrons from the remnant s shell in the compressed magnetic field of the cloud , while the highest energy gamma - rays from pion decay are mainly produced inside the cloud where the target density is high ( fukui @xcite ) .",
    "if the highest energy protons freely penetrate into the clouds , the corresponding gamma - emission from the pion decay may exceed the gamma - emission from the pion decay of the remnant by a factor that is the ratio of the cloud mass to the mass swept up by the forward shock .",
    "if the clouds c and d indeed contain about 100 - 1000 solar masses ( fukui @xcite ) , this ratio should be close to 10 - 100 . since this is not the case , as it follows from the hess results",
    ", the hadronic models can survive only if the penetration into the clouds is depressed .",
    "such a possibility seems unlikely , at least for the highest energy protons .    on the other hand , in the leptonic models of gamma - rays , in which the bulk of the gamma - ray emission is produced via ic scattering of electrons",
    ", one may expect significant contribution of hadronic gamma - rays produced in the clouds c and d. namely the gamma - ray fluxes from p - p interactions shown in figs.8&9 can be enhanced by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude . apparently ,",
    "from these regions we should expect also low energy , mev / gev gamma - rays .",
    "because of low density of the ambient gas , the gamma - radiation outside the c and d clouds will be dominated by the ic component , therefore the gamma - ray flux at mev / gev energies is expected to be faint ( see figs.8.&9 ) .    in fig .",
    "14 we demonstrate the feasibility of the `` composite '' scenario .",
    "the hadronic component of gamma - rays from dense clouds is shown by multiplying the flux expected from the low density gas downstream of the forward shock by a factor of 120 .",
    "the ratio of the gamma - rays from clouds to the flux from other parts of the shell depends on the ratio of the mass of clouds to the mass of the shell , provided that all particles freely enter the dense clouds .",
    "this however could not be the case especially for the low energy particles which introduces large uncertainties in the predictions of the flux of this component of radiation .",
    "on the other hand , if the enhancement of hadronic gamma - rays in clouds is indeed very large , this could help to improve the fit of the gamma - ray data both at low ( sub tev ) and high energy ( multi - tev ) regions ( see fig .",
    "note that in this scenario we expect also gamma - rays from dense clouds due to bremsstrahlung of electrons .",
    "however , as long as the total energy in protons significantly exceeds the energy in relativistic electrons , the interaction of latters with the dense gas will dominate over the bremsstrahlung .",
    "the parameters characterizing acceleration of particles in the reverse shock in the leptonic models are not strongly constrained .",
    "while in the hadronic models the reverse shock must be an efficient accelerator of multi tev electrons in order to produce the synchrotron x - radiation observed from the inner ring , in the leptonic models the acceleration by the inverse shock is not required . indeed , in the leptonic models the electrons accelerated at the forward shock",
    "may easily reach the contact discontinuity downstream of the forward shock with relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "they will produce x - rays in the amplified magnetic field between the contact discontinuity and the reverse shock ( see fig.11 ) .",
    "the magnetic field can not be weak in this region since the inner ring is clearly visible in radio .",
    "the corresponding radio - electrons must be accelerated at the reverse shock .",
    "the magnetic field amplified at the reverse shock has probably rather small scales .",
    "this is because the scale of the most unstable mhd mode is proportional to the strength of the undisturbed field in the case of the non - resonant streaming instability ( bell @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field of ejecta @xmath214 g is significantly smaller than the field in the circumstellar medium ( presumably about @xmath215 g ) .",
    "the small - scale magnetic field is not a very efficient scatter of highest energy electrons . as a result",
    ", the diffusion may be significantly faster than the bohm diffusion , and the acceleration at the reverse shock up to tev energies might be impossible .",
