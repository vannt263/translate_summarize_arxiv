    "galaxy cluster masses are clearly of cosmological significance , and examples abound : ( 1 ) the differences in cluster evolution as a function of mass provide constraints on the power spectrum ( @xcite , 1994 ) , ( 2 ) comparisons of the amounts of luminous and non  luminous matter in clusters provide clues to the nature of dark matter and the efficiency of galaxy formation ( @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) the cluster mass  to  light ratio and baryon fraction constrain the cosmological density parameter @xmath13 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cluster mass studies tend to focus on the central regions where virial equilibrium is a more accurate approximation , and the weak lensing signals are easiest to detect . here",
    "we apply a method to measure the mass beyond the virialized region in the double cluster a2626 .",
    "we utilize recent improvements in the understanding of the fundamental plane ( fp ) to constrain the total cluster binding mass by revisiting the subcluster radial infall model ( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , measuring fp distances ( with an accuracy of 15% to 25% ) to a reasonably large sample of cluster galaxies can yield a very accurate ( sub)cluster distance ( @xcite ) . for two bound subclusters , the line of sight separation",
    ", the line of sight velocity difference , and the projected separation provide enough information to estimate the total cluster binding mass in cases where a radial infall model is appropriate .",
    "although a2626 is rather distant , it is well suited for this analysis because simply demonstrating that the two subclusters are bound and infalling has interesting implications . a straightforward application of the radial infall model , using the ( rest frame ) line of sight velocity difference and the virial mass estimates within each subcluster ,",
    "rules out bound and infalling merger models ( @xcite ; hereafter mgw96 ) ; the virial masses are not large enough to produce the apparent velocity difference .",
    "thus , fp distances used to determine whether or not the subclusters in a2626 are bound and infalling serve as an independent test of the virial estimators , or alternatively , as a means of measuring the mass beyond the virialized region of the cluster .",
    "possible pitfalls to this approach include ( 1 ) distance biasing fp zeropoint ( or shape ) differences between subclusters , ( 2 ) deviations from radial infall , and ( 3 ) significant interactions between the virialized regions of the two subclusters .",
    "fp variation with cluster environment is an area of active research ( e.g. @xcite ; hereafter jfk96 ) ; current indications are that distance biases are smaller than 5% for ellipticals within clusters and are related to observable variations in the stellar populations within cluster galaxies . as discussed below , subcluster pairs suffering from pitfall numbers 2 and 3 can be identified through corresponding observational signatures .",
    "we argue that the radial infall model and fp distances provide a promising method for determining cluster masses on scales larger than the virialized region in low redshift clusters ; if coupled with estimates of cluster light at larger radii , these mass measures should suffice to determine whether mass to light ratios vary significantly between the virialized core and the surrounding infall region . for higher redshift cluster pairs , our approach could be used to quantify the level of environmentally induced fundamental plane zeropoint variations .",
    "we describe the double cluster a2626 , the fp observations , and the reductions in @xmath14 . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive fp coefficients , discuss constraints on the stellar populations in each subcluster , and derive constraints on their relative distances .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of the radial infall model applied to a2626 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 5 . throughout the paper we use @xmath15",
    "km / s / mpc .",
    "below we describe abell 2626 ( @xcite ) , summarize previous observational results detailed elsewhere ( mgw96 ) , present the new observations , and describe the reductions and analysis in detail .      a redshift survey with the decaspec ( @xcite ) mounted on the mdm hiltner 2.4  m telescope in fall 1993 and 1994 revealed that abell 2626 ( @xmath16  km / s , richness class 0 ) is composed of at least two systems with mean line of sight velocities which differ by @xmath17  km / s ( mgw96 ) .",
    "as is clear from fig .",
    "[ figvel ] and table [ grouptab ] , there are two main components with cluster  like dispersions : group a centered at a velocity of @xmath18  km / s and group b centered at a velocity of @xmath19  km / s ( 90% statistical confidence limits ) . as discussed in mgw96 , the 11 galaxies centered at @xmath20  km / s are most likely part of a background , low density structure because ( 1 ) the dispersion is low ( @xmath21  km / s ) and ( 2 ) a large fraction of these galaxies are gas rich 73% have emission lines compared to 39% ( 33% ) for group a ( b ) .",
    "if the velocity of the low density structure corresponds to hubble flow then its distance from groups a and b is from 20@xmath22  mpc to 50@xmath22mpc .    the group a and b masses , velocity dispersions , central densities and x  ray properties all differ .",
    "as noted in table [ grouptab ] , the virial mass of subgroup a is roughly twice that of b , and the line of sight velocity dispersions are @xmath23  km / s and @xmath24  km / s ( 90% statistical confidence limits ) .",
    "the absence of observed x  ray emission from group b can be used to place a limit on the central gas density in group b ( mgw96 ) . in particular , the _ einstein _",
    "imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) image of the region reaches roughly 50 times fainter than the peak in the x  ray emission from group a. the group a central gas density is @xmath25  @xmath26 , so the central gas density in group b must be @xmath27  @xmath26 .",
    "although the contrast in the projected galaxy densities of groups a and b is difficult to quantify , the smoothed distribution ( figure 3 in mgw96 ) indicates that the central density in group b is @xmath28 times less than the central density in group a. thus , the ratio of gas to galaxy density may be the same in both groups .    as discussed below , if groups a and b are on a radial infall trajectory , then the minimum implied gravitational mass is more than the sum of their virial masses .",
    "however , it is also possible that the velocity difference is just due to hubble flow .",
    "the magnitude distributions of the confirmed members of both groups indicate that the merger hypothesis is favored over hubble flow at 93% confidence ( mgw96 ) . to further investigate this issue we measure fundamental plane distances to each cluster and determine the line of sight distance difference directly .",
    "to do so we first use @xmath1 band ccd photometry to identify a sample of early type galaxies with redshift confirmed membership .      on november 21 , 1995 , we used a thinned , tektronix 1024@xmath29 ccd mounted on the mdm hiltner 2.4  m telescope to image galaxies in a2626 and j8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 24@xmath30 pixels are 0.275  @xmath31 on a side . the seeing varied during the night between 0.85  @xmath31 and 1.05  @xmath31 . because the night was non ",
    "photometric , we determine the photometric zeropoint of each @xmath1 band image externally . for the a2626 galaxies we use photometric images taken previously ( mgw96 ) on the mdm  1.3  m to zeropoint our images .",
    "specifically , we use aperture photometry of isolated stars in the 2.4  m and 1.3  m frames to determine the 2.4  m zeropoint .",
    "the 1.3  m images are reduced to the kron  cousins system using landolt ( 1992 ) standards .",
    "for j8 we rely primarily on published photoelectric galaxy aperture photometry ( @xcite ) to determine the r band zeropoint but also use stellar aperture photometry from a photometric 1.3  m image for one galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to our primary imaging run , we acquired additional hiltner 2.4 m images through the generosity of paul schechter ; the reductions for these data were similar .",
    "the @xmath1 band galactic extinction is 0.062  mag toward a2626 ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database , @xcite ) and 0.185  mag toward j8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we approximate the @xmath32 correction as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the galaxy redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "we account for the peculiar velocity component of the line of sight velocity when applying the cosmological dimming correction ; specifically , two of the factors of @xmath35 in the cosmological dimming are due to relativistic effects and two are due to the change in the geometry of the universe between emission and detection . writing @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the hubble flow and peculiar velocity components of the redshift , the cosmological dimming is written @xmath39 ; in terms of the observed and peculiar redshift , the correction is @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 is model dependent . as an example , if groups a and b are at the same distance and the peculiar velocity correction were incorrectly taken to be @xmath42 , the fundamental plane distances would be biased so that group b would appear closer than group a by @xmath43% .",
    "we bias subtract , flat field ( using twilight flats ) , and clean the images using standard iraf tasks . for each galaxy , we calculate sky subtracted radial profiles and uncertainties .",
    "uncertainties have a poisson component added in quadrature with an assumed 1% flat fielding uncertainty .",

    "our fitting procedure accounts for the effects of psf smoothing and pixel extent as described in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we determine the parameters of the and disk components by minimizing the @xmath49 difference between the seeing convolved model and the observed profile .",

    "the integral flux follows from the bulge , disk and psf parameters .",
    "specifically , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a bessel function , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the fourier transforms of the psf , the bulge , and the exponential disk .",
    "following @xcite , we use a psf of the form @xmath59 and find it to be a good fit to stars on the 2.4  m images with @xmath60 .",
    "we use the analytic approximation to the fourier transform of the law ( @xcite ) , and the exact form of the transform of the disk component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fitting procedure has three steps :    * fit the psf parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 using radial profiles of @xmath63 stars within each 2.4  m image ; best fit parameters minimize the @xmath49 difference between the observed and model profile .",
    "* feed initial guesses for the bulge and disk parameters into a simplex minimization routine ( @xcite ) which minimizes the @xmath49 difference between the seeing convolved theoretical and observed profiles . at each iteration",
    "the full fourier integral is solved for each point in the radial profile ; with an hp735 the minimization takes several minutes .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in the observed profile , a theoretical uncertainty is introduced to account for imperfections in the smoothing corrections ( e.g. the exact form of the psf ) .",
    "specifically , the uncertainty for each profile point has a component which is proportional to the fractional effect of the smoothing on the model profile .",
    "this has the positive effect of making the fit results less sensitive to the inclusion / exclusion of the heavily smoothed inner points in the profile and to the details of the smoothing operation .",
    "we include a theoretical uncertainty which is 10% of the fractional effect of the smoothing on the model profile .",
    "this is consistent with a philosophy that we can correct for seeing effects at the 90% level .",
    "* we fit a bulge only model to the profile and compare the minimum @xmath49 for this model to the bulge plus disk @xmath49 . for galaxies",
    "where @xmath49 is only minimally improved by the inclusion of the disk component we use the bulge only fit .",
    "once the fitting is complete , we use the best fit parameters to calculate @xmath2 the half luminosity radius , @xmath64 the surface brightness at @xmath2 , and @xmath4 the mean surface brightness within @xmath2 .",
    "we test our fitting routines by ( 1 ) fitting artificial galaxy images , ( 2 ) comparing results from multiple images of the same galaxy , and ( 3 ) comparing our results to those of saglia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the cluster j8 .",
    "we create artificial images by adding a galaxy described by an  profile to a flat background of @xmath65 cts / pixel .",
    "we then smooth the artificial image and introduce poisson noise . by using delta functions instead of  profiles",
    "we produce stars which are then used to measure the psf parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the process of fitting artificial galaxy images tests the accuracy of our fitting in that case where the true galaxy profile is well described by an  profile .",
    "we find that the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 are constrained to an accuracy of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath2 as small as 50% the fwhm of the psf .",
    "as expected , the accuracy of the combination @xmath68 ( which appears in the equation describing the fundamental plane ) is constrained to @xmath69 because the errors in @xmath2 and @xmath4 are correlated .",
    "we also compare results from subarcsecond seeing images of seven a2626 galaxies to results from poorer quality images .",
    "the mean offset between the parameters in the good and poor seeing images of the same galaxies are consistent with zero , and the scatter is small .",
    "specifically , @xmath70 with an rms of 0.0823 , @xmath71 with an rms of 0.0196 , and @xmath72 with an rms of 0.0097 .",
    "we observed five galaxies in the efar cluster j8 ( @xcite ) for which we have photometric zeropoints .",
    "these observations provide the strongest test of our methods because the data , reductions and analyses differ significantly .",
    "there are no significant offsets between our values and efar values ( @xcite ) ; specifically , @xmath73 with an rms of 0.2735 , @xmath74 with an rms of 0.0729 , and @xmath75 with an rms of 0.0249 .",
    "these three tests of our photometric methods indicate that our procedure is accurate and makes only a small contribution to the observed scatter in the fundamental plane ( see below ) .      on november 22 and 23 , 1995",
    ", we used the decaspec ( @xcite ) plus mkiii spectrograph mounted on the mdm hiltner 2.4  m telescope to obtain spectra of four galaxy fields in abell 2626 , one field in j8 ( @xcite ) , and multiple spectra of five hd stellar velocity standards .",
    "the decaspec fibers subtend 2.3@xmath31 in the focal plane .",
    "we used a grism blazed at 5,700    with 600  l / mm , yielding a typical psf of 5.3    at 2.18    per pixel and coverage from 4,300    to 6,500 .",
    "four or five thirty minute exposures were obtained for each of the a2626 fields ; shorter exposures were obtained for the brighter j8 field .",
    "we extracted the spectra , using arc lamp exposures taken on either side of each object exposure to dispersion correct .",
    "we then combined the spectra from the four to five exposures , excluding cosmic rays through sigma clipping of large , positive deviations . with the decaspec",
    "there are four sky spectra for each object spectrum .",
    "we combined the sky spectra for each object , scaled the sky spectrum using the flux in the 5577    sky line , and then removed the sky contribution from the object spectrum .",
    "the final spectra range in signal to noise ( s / n ) from s / n=20 to 75 per pixel at 5,300   .",
    "we obtained spectra of more galaxies , stellar velocity and lick linestrength standards ( @xcite ) using the modspec mounted on the mdm hiltner 2.4 m telescope in nov and dec 96 .",
    "we used a 1,200  l / mm grating , the 200  mm camera , a thinned ccd with 24  @xmath30 m pixels , and a 1.7@xmath31 wide slit ; standard longslit reductions led to spectra with 2    resolution , 1   / pixel sampling , and coverage from 4,800  to 5,800 .",
    "galaxy exposure times ranged from 20  min to 2.5  hrs , and the spectra have s / n@xmath76 per pixel .",
    "the higher resolution of this setup allowed us to accurately measure galaxy dispersions as low as 100  km / s .    for each run , galaxy dispersions and velocities",
    "are extracted using the stellar templates from that run and the cross correlation peak fitting available in fxcor ( iraf.rv ) ; we use the approximate wavelength region 4,8005,800  which contains the strong mg features .",
    "the correlation peak width is transformed to an intrinsic galaxy dispersion using translation tables created for each stellar template ; the translation tables are produced by cross correlating the stellar templates against gaussian broadened versions of themselves .",
    "the final galaxy dispersion is the mean of the dispersions from each stellar template in the run .",
    "finally , an aperture correction @xmath77 is applied .",
    "this aperture correction accounts for the falling dispersion profile in early type galaxies ; we normalize to an aperture of radius @xmath78 and a galaxy with @xmath79 .",
    "for the longslit spectra we use @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the width and length of the rectangular aperture ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties in our dispersions using monte carlo techniques . for each galaxy spectrum",
    "we broaden a stellar template to mimic the measured dispersion , scale the template to the observed cts / pix in the region around 5,200   , and add the sky at the observed level .",
    "we sample this artificial galaxy spectrum 100 times , introducing the poisson noise and sky subtracting , and then measure the dispersion .",
    "we use the rms of the measured dispersions around the input value as a measure of the velocity dispersion uncertainty ( see table [ galtab ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the simulations indicate that averaging the dispersions measured by cross correlating against multiple templates does not improve the accuracy .",
    "however , these simulations consider only poisson noise effects ; we average the multiple dispersion measurements from each galaxy spectrum to reduce template mismatch systematics .",
    "we have multiple spectra for 21 galaxies .",
    "the distribution of dispersion differences scaled by the uncertainties for the 28 comparison pairs has an rms of 0.97 , indicating that the monte carlo uncertainties are a reasonably good estimate of our true dispersion uncertainties .",
    "the mean scaled difference ( @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the uncertainty in the difference ) between modspec and decaspec measurements for 23 comparison pairs has a mean of @xmath85 with an rms scatter about this mean of 0.89 ; the variance weighted , mean logarithmic difference between modspec and decaspec dispersions is @xmath86 . because there is no evidence for a systematic difference between dispersions measured with the decaspec and the modspec",
    ", we apply no correction .",
    "we note that the modspec was used in measuring dispersions for 10 of the 16 galaxies in group a and 5 of the 8 galaxies in group b ; so any systematic offset between decaspec and modspec measurements would add to the fp scatter within each group , but would not bias the estimate of the distance difference .",

    "second , the study of more distant double clusters ( at @xmath199 ) provides a means of directly probing for environmentally driven biases in fp distance estimates .      here",
    "we apply this approach to the double cluster a2626 at @xmath0  km / s .",
    "because of the cluster distance , it is critical to make seeing corrections while extracting @xmath89 and @xmath4 .",
    "our method is similar to the one described by saglia _",
    "( 1993b ) , but includes a seeing ",
    "correction uncertainty which makes the photometric parameters less sensitive to the in / exclusion of central points in the profile .",
    "we also note that the cosmological dimming correction to the surface brightness has a peculiar velocity dependence which may be important in cases where many fp distance estimates are combined to produce a single , more accurate cluster distance ( @xmath150 ) .    through numerous cross checks",
    "we demonstrate that our estimates of the combination @xmath200 which appears in the fp are sufficiently accurate that their errors make no significant contribution to the fp scatter ; using a monte carlo approach we estimate the velocity dispersion uncertainties ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "these parameters for the 8 galaxies in group b and the 16 in group a are listed in table [ galtab ] .",
    "we combine galaxies from both clusters in a single fit , weighting to account for incompleteness ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "our best fit fp coefficients ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are statistically consistent with measurements in other clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ figfp ] ) .",
    "the rms scatter about this plane in @xmath203 is 0.09 , corresponding to 23% distance uncertainties per galaxy .",
    "we examine the distribution of @xmath7 equivalent widths with the galaxy spectra from both subclusters ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "we find that there is no evidence for significant differences in the @xmath7@xmath3 relation ( see fig .",
    "[ mgfig ] ) .",
    "our result does not contradict the recently noted correlation between cluster environment and linestrength ( jfk96 , @xcite ) ; the expected offset in @xmath7 ( given the velocity dispersion differences between groups a and b ) is too small to detect with our data .",
    "the difference in the fundamental plane zeropoints for the two clusters is @xmath205 , consistent with no offset ( @xmath107 ) . under the assumption that this zeropoint difference is indicative of distance differences , @xmath206 , where the uncertainty follows from scatter around the median distance in each cluster with the best fit fp coefficients .",
    "we use the @xmath122 bootstrap resampling simulations to measure the variation of the distance offset as fp coefficients vary .",
    "the relative distance constraint is robust enough to reject the hubble flow hypothesis ( @xmath207 ) in 99% of the simulations . under the hubble flow hypothesis , the two clusters are not interacting gravitationally , and the velocity difference reflects pure hubble flow .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath1 band magnitude distributions of confirmed members of both clusters rules out hubble flow with 93% confidence ( mgw96 ) .",
    "if the subclusters were on an outgoing trajectory ( bound or unbound ) , then the line of sight distance difference would have to be greater than their current recession velocity times the age of the universe ( @xmath208  mpc ) which is greater than the hubble flow value : @xmath209 ; thus , models where groups a and b are on outgoing trajectories are ruled out with higher confidence than pure hubble flow .",
    "therefore , our relative distances indicate that the subclusters are bound and infalling with 99% confidence ( see fig .",
    "[ figdistance ] ) .      assuming bound and infalling subclusters ,",
    "we model these kinematics with a radial infall model ( @xcite ) ; this two body model is appropriate for separations large compared to the scale of the virialized region of the cluster and in cases where there are no other massive clusters in the neighborhood . given the projected separation , line of sight velocity difference , and line of sight separation , the radial infall model provides an estimate of the total cluster binding mass which depends weakly on the adopted age of the universe . from fig .",
    "[ figmerge ] , the total binding mass is at least 1.65 times higher than the virial sum , a difference significant at @xmath11",
    ". the total binding mass could be much larger than this minimum .",
    "the differences in these two mass estimates could indicate ( 1 ) deviations from radial infall , ( 2 ) an error in the virial estimate , or ( 3 ) significant mass beyond the virialized region . the x  ray image of a2626 provides no indication of interactions between the two subclusters , and there is no third subcluster , so the radial infall model should be appropriate in a2626 .",
    "if the virial estimators are biased low , then the radial infall model indicates that @xmath210 ( see table [ grouptab ] ) , which would be a surprisingly high value ( e.g. ramella et al .",
    "these arguments suggest that the minimum merger mass is larger than the virial mass because it is sensitive to mass in the cluster infall region .    taking the merger mass as a lower limit on the mass within the cluster infall region",
    ", we can address whether there is evidence for variation of the mass to light ratio between the cluster core and infall region .",
    "the galaxy light is calculated within a region which only extends to a projected radius of 1.5@xmath22  mpc ; presumably both the galaxy and mass distributions extend beyond this region .",
    "we have no ccd photometry over the larger region to directly measure the total cluster light . assuming that the projected galaxy distribution falls off as @xmath211 ( e.g.  @xcite ) with a similar luminosity function to the galaxies in the central region , the total cluster light grows as @xmath212 for @xmath1 larger than the core radius . under these assumptions , within a diameter of @xmath213  mpc there is enough light to yield a mass  to  light ratio of @xmath214 throughout the cluster even with the higher mass estimate from the radial infall model . of course",
    ", the binding mass could be many times larger than the minimum value , so the mass  to  light ratio could increase significantly outside the virialized cluster core .",
    "a study of the cluster light extending to larger radius and a larger sample of fp distances would yield more concrete information regarding any variation in the cluster mass  to  light ratio in a2626 .",
    "fp studies of other double clusters , coupled with ( 1 ) a more detailed accounting of the radial distribution of cluster light and ( 2 ) larger redshift samples to enable a more accurate estimate of the virial mass , should provide interesting constraints on the distribution of cluster mass and possible differences in the efficiency of galaxy formation beyond the virialized region .",

    "four of our 24 galaxies show peculiar morphologies ; here we detail the peculiarities and demonstrate that eliminating them from the analysis does not significantly alter our conclusions .",
    "the following are morphological types which we derived by comparing deep 2.4  m images and the carnegie atlas of galaxies ( @xcite ) :      without these four galaxies , group a ( b ) contains 12 ( 8) galaxies ; we now apply the analysis detailed in @xmath220 to this smaller sample .",
    "the best fit form of the fp is @xmath221 and the scatter around this plane in @xmath120 is 0.080 ( 20% distance uncertainty ) .",
    "these coefficients are consistent with the values from the full sample , but the scatter is somewhat smaller and the @xmath112 uncertainty is larger .",
    "the fp coefficient uncertainties are determined ( as before ) through bootstrap resampling and refitting the sample .",
    "the rms scatter around the median distance estimator in group a ( b ) is 0.066 ( 0.115 ) ; the zeropoint difference corrected for homogeneous malmquist bias is @xmath222 the zeropoint difference and uncertainty ( from the scatter ) are somewhat smaller than for the whole sample ( see eqn . [ gamoff ] ) .",
    "this measurement is inconsistent with the hubble flow hypothesis at @xmath223 or 97.7% confidence . the bootstrap refitting produces a distribution of @xmath145 which includes the variation in the fp coefficients ; 5000 refits of this smaller sample rule out the hubble flow hypothesis with 98.2% confidence . in summary , removing 4 galaxies which have morphological peculiarities slightly reduces the significance with which the hubble flow model can be rejected in abell 2626 ."

    "<S> we use fundamental plane ( fp ) distance estimates to the components of the double cluster a2626 ( @xmath0  km / s ) to constrain cluster kinematics and estimate total binding mass . </S>",
    "<S> we employ deep @xmath1 band ccd photometry , multi  object spectroscopy , and software designed to account for seeing effects to measure the fp parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for 24 known early type and s0 cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> the fp coefficients from this sample ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are consistent with others reported in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> we examine the @xmath7 equivalent width distributions within both subclusters and find them to be indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> lacking evidence for stellar population differences , we interpret the fp zeropoint offset between the two subclusters as a measure of the distance difference . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance to subcluster @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement is consistent with the subclusters being at the same distance , and it rules out the hubble flow hypothesis ( distances proportional to velocity ) with 99% confidence ; analysis of the subcluster galaxy magnitude distributions rules out hubble flow at 93% confidence . </S>",
    "<S> both results favor a kinematic model where the subclusters are bound and infalling .    </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the total cluster binding mass by modelling the subcluster merger as radial infall . </S>",
    "<S> the projected separation , the line of sight velocity difference and the line of sight separation constrain the cluster mass ; the _ minimum _ possible total binding mass is 1.65 times higher than the sum of the standard virial masses , a difference statistically significant at the @xmath11 level . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss explanations for the inconsistency including ( 1 ) biases in the standard virial mass estimator , ( 2 ) biases in our radial infall mass estimate , and ( 3 ) mass beyond the virialized cluster region ; if the standard virial mass is significantly in error , the cluster has an unusually high mass  to  light ratio ( @xmath12 ) . because observational signatures of departures from radial infall are absent </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the implications of mass beyond the virialized , core regions .    </S>",
