    "each marble therefore does a standard continuous - time random walk on the graph but the different walks are dependent .",
    "this process is called _ the interchange process _ and is one of the standard examples of an interacting particle system , related to exclusion processes ( where the marbles have only a few possible colors ) but typically more complicated .",
    "further , when one considers the evolution of the permutation taking the initial positions of the marbles to their positions at time @xmath6 , one gets a continuous - time random walk on a ( weighted ) _ cayley graph _ of the group of permutations @xmath1 .",
