    "since its formal foundation as a theory of ground - state properties @xcite , density functional theory has developed into one of the most successful methods of modern many - body theory , today also with well - established extensions such as , e.g. , time - dependent @xcite and current @xcite density - functional theory ( dft ) . in particular in the field of metal cluster physics , dft calculations have contributed substantially to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of both ground and excited state properties @xcite .",
    "understanding the properties of small metal particles in turn offers technological opportunities , e.g. , to better control catalysis @xcite , as well as fundamental insights into how matter grows @xcite .",
    "since the electronic and geometric structure of metal particles consisting of only a few atoms still can not be measured directly , photoabsorption spectra are their most accurate probes .",
    "especially the spectra of charged sodium clusters have been measured with high accuracy for a broad range of cluster sizes and temperatures @xcite .",
    "a distinct feature of these spectra is that at elevated temperatures of several hundred k , in particular for the larger clusters , only a few broad peaks are observed , whereas at lower temperatures ( 100 k and less ) , a greater number of sharp lines can be resolved for clusters with only a few atoms .",
    "the peaks observed in the high - temperature experiments found an early and intuitive explanation as collective excitations in analogy to the bulk plasmon and the giant resonances in nuclei : different peaks in the spectrum were understood as belonging to the different spatial directions of the collective motion of the valence electrons with respect to the inert ionic background . on the other hand",
    ", the sharp lines observed in the low - temperature experiments were interpreted as a hallmark of the molecule - like properties of the small clusters explicable , in the language of quantum chemistry @xcite , only in terms of transitions between molecular states .    in this work we present a density functional approach to the calculation of excitations that leads us to a unified and transparent physical understanding of the photoabsorption spectra of sodium clusters .",
    "we first derive a general variational principle for the exact energy spectrum of an interacting many - body system . from this , we derive an approximate solution in the form of quantum fluid - dynamical differential equations for the density displacement fields associated with the electronic vibrations around their ground state . by solving these equations",
    ", we obtain the eigenmodes within the dft ; hereby only the ground - state energy functional and the occupied kohn - sham orbitals are required .",
    "we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by calculating the photoabsorption spectra of small sodium clusters and comparing our results to low - temperature experiments and to configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculations . in this way",
    "we can show that also the spectra of the smallest clusters can be understood , without knowledge of the molecular many - body wavefunction , in an intuitive picture of oscillations of the valence - electron density against the ionic background .",
    "starting point for the derivation of the variational principle is the well - known fact that for a many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath0 with ground state @xmath1 and energy @xmath2 , the creation and annihilation operators of all the eigenstates obey the so - called equations of motion for excitation operators @xcite @xmath3 | 0 \\rangle & = & \\hbar \\omega_\\nu \\langle 0 | { \\cal o_\\nu o_\\nu^\\dagger } | 0 \\rangle \\\\   \\langle 0 | { \\cal o_\\nu}[h , { \\cal o_\\nu } ] | 0 \\rangle & = & \\hbar \\omega_\\nu \\langle 0 | { \\cal o_\\nu o_\\nu } | 0 \\rangle = 0 , \\label{equofmotion2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined by @xmath6 of course , the exact solution of these equations are in general unknown . but",
    "a variety of approximations to the true excited states can be derived from them , e.g. , the tam - dancoff scheme and the small amplitude limit of time - dependent hartree - fock theory ( rpa ) . as discussed in @xcite , also higher - order approximations can be obtained .",
    "related to these equations , we derive the following variational principle : solving the equations ( [ equofmotion1 ] ) and ( [ equofmotion2 ] ) for the lowest excited state can be achieved by solving the variational equation @xmath7}{\\delta q}=0\\ ] ] in the space of all hermitean operators . here",

    "we would like to point out that in earlier work @xcite , the rpa equations have been derived with a related technique that made use of both generalized coordinate and momentum operators .",
    "the advantage of our present derivation is that  although within linear response theory  it goes beyond rpa and , due to the formulation in terms of a generalized coordinate only , is particularly suitable for the formulation of the variational principle in the framework of density functional theory as shown below .",

    "the square roots of the eigenvalues then give the excitation energies and from the eigenvectors , the oscillator strengths can be computed .    it should be noted that for systems as small as the ones studied here , generalized gradient approximations @xcite and their extensions @xcite in general are a better approximation to the exchange and correlation energy than the lda . however , in the present case lda is a good approximation since the valence electrons in sodium clusters are strongly delocalized .",
    "furthermore , the bond length underestimation in lda which was shown to strongly influence optical properties @xcite is corrected to a large extent by using the smooth - core pseudopotential which by construction gives bondlegths close to the experimetal ones when used with the lda @xcite .",

    "the lca correctly reproduces the electronic transitions , despite the fact that only two electrons are involved . due to",
    "( [ seecon ] ) , one can very easily visualize how the electrons move in a particular excitation by plotting the corresponding @xmath86 , giving a `` snapshot '' picture of @xmath87 .",
    "for the two main excitations , a crossection of this quantity along the symmetry axis ( @xmath88 axis ) is shown in the lower left and upper right contourplots , and the ground - state valence electron density is shown in the lower right for reference .",
    "in the plots of @xmath87 , shadings darker than the background grey indicate a density increase , lighter shadings indicate a decrease .",
    "it becomes clear that the lower excitation corresponds to a density oscillation along the @xmath88 axis whereas the higher excitation corresponds to two energetically degenerate oscillations perpendicular to the symmetry axis .",
    "( for the sake of clarity , we plotted the corresponding oscillator strengths on top of each other in the photoabsorption spectrum . )",
    "this is exactly what one would have expected intuitively .",
    "but the plots reveal that besides the expected general charge transfer from one end of the cluster to the other , the presence of the ionic cores hinders the valence electrons to be shifted freely , creating a density shift of reverse sign in between the ionic cores .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the ionic ground - state configuration of @xmath89 with our labeling of axes in the upper left , the experimental low - temperature ( @xmath90 100 k ) photoabsorption spectrum @xcite in the upper right , the lca photoabsorption spectrum in the lower left , and the ci spectrum adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite in the lower right .",
    "again , a phenomenological line broadening was introduced in the presentation of both the lca and the ci results .",
    "the lca spectrum again is in close agreement with the experimentally observed spectrum , showing three intense transitions . with our choice of the coordinate system , the lowest excitation corresponds to a density oscillation in @xmath88 direction , whereas the two higher excitations oscillate in both @xmath91 and @xmath92 directions . in the interpretation of the lca results ,",
    "it must be kept in mind that due to our finite grid spacing the numerical accuracy for the excitation energies is about 0.03 ev , which is absolutely sufficient in the light of the physical approximations that we are making .",
    "but due to this finite numerical resolution and the fact that we evaluate each direction of oscillation separately , the @xmath91 and @xmath92 components of the excitations at 2.7 ev and 3.4 ev , which really should be degenerate for symmetry reasons , appear as extremely close - lying double lines .",
    "however , since the symmetry of the cluster was in no way an input to our calculation , it is a reassuring test that the lca , indeed , fulfills the symmetry requirement within the numerical accuracy .",
    "furthermore , it is reassuring to see that with respect to the relative heights of the peaks the lca is very close to the ci results , with differences observed only in the small subpeaks that are not seen experimentally anyway . and",
    "small differences to the ci calculation are already to be expected simply because of the use of different pseudopotentials and the resulting small differences in the ground - state structure .",
    "in summary , we have derived a set of quantum fluid - dynamical equations from a general variational principle for the excitations of a many - body system .",
    "the equations describe here the eigenmodes of the system s ( valence ) electrons and require only the knowledge of the occupied ground - state kohn - sham orbitals . from these equations , we have computed the photoabsorption spectra for small sodium clusters and find quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed peak positions .",
    "thus , even low - temperature photoabsorption spectra can be understood in an intuitive picture of density oscillations , without knowledge of the true ( or any approximate ) many - body wavefunction .",

    "<S> a partial differential eigenvalue equation for the density displacement fields associated with electronic excitations is derived in the framework of density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> our quantum fluid - dynamical approach is based on a variational principle and the kohn - sham ground - state energy functional , using only the occupied kohn - sham orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for an intuitive interpretation of electronic excitations in terms of intrinsic local currents that obey a continuity equation . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the capabilities of this non - empirical approach by calculating the photoabsorption spectra of small sodium clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra shows that even for the smallest clusters , the resonances observed experimentally at low temperatures can be interpreted in terms of density vibrations . </S>"
