    "the observation of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of exciton - polaritons has generated a large amount of interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "the focus has now turned to examining various properties of the condensate , such as thermal equilibration @xcite , superfluidity @xcite , vortex formation @xcite , and elementary excitations @xcite . if the trend followed by atom optics physics community holds for the exciton - polariton community , one important branch of study of exciton - polariton becs will be the application of periodic potentials on the bec system .",
    "optical lattices have attracted much attention , spurred on by the experiments demonstrating the phase transition between a bec and a mott insulating state in a bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the application of the periodic potential simultaneously increases the particle - particle interaction , as well as decreasing the kinetic energy .",
    "this allows the ratio of the hubbard on - site interaction to the hopping amplitude @xmath2 to be varied at will .",
    "the experiment has been of particular interest in the quantum information community , since the experiment realizes a nearly ideal quantum simulator @xcite .",
    "a quantum simulator is a device that directly recreates a quantum many - body problem in the laboratory . by experimentally modifying physical parameters , such as the periodic potential amplitude , temperature , and density",
    ", one may explore the phase diagram of the system .",
    "the formation of a bose - hubbard model using polaritonic systems was first proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop the theory for exciton - polaritons subject to a periodic potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : device]a ) .",
    "in contrast to the works of refs .",
    "@xcite , where the polariton interaction originates from an effective nonlinearity due to a coupling to atomic sites , our interaction originates from the excitonic components of the polaritons , which ultimately originates from a coulomb interaction .",
    "starting from a microscopic hamiltonian for electrons and holes and their coulomb interaction , we derive the origin of the bose - hubbard model that is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , allowing an accurate determination of the bose - hubbard parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . from an experimental point of view , steps towards a similar experimental configuration as the optical lattice have been realized already by modifying the semiconductor microcavity system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that a band structure was successfully formed using a metal deposition technique .",
    "the periodic metal structure on the surface changes the boundary conditions of the photon field , thus creating a static periodic potential for the polaritons @xcite .",
    "other methods for trapping polaritons have been proposed by etching the microcavity @xcite .",
    "such etching techniques are anticipated to produce stronger trapping potentials and access a more strongly correlated regime @xcite .",
    "the formal similarity in the treatment of indirect excitons allows us to write general formulas that capture both the polariton and indirect exciton interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : device]b ) .",
    "polaritons are described in the @xmath3 limit of the formulas , where @xmath4 is the bilayer separation of the indirect exciton system .",
    "indirect excitons have a non - zero @xmath4 , but a vanishing photon component .",
    "although only exciton - polaritons have currently been observed to undergo bose - einstein condensation so far @xcite , there is a large amount of interest in becs of indirect excitons , as well as works of indirect excitons in periodic lattices @xcite , motivating us to write the generalized formulas for both cases .",
    "we place particular interest on what parameters are required for observing a bose - hubbard mott transition . for indirect excitons , as the bilayer separation @xmath4 is increased , the bosonic nature of the excitons gradually diminishes due to the reduced electron - hole interaction .",
    "the system is more appropriately described as a fermi - hubbard model in this limit .",
    "we discuss the criterion for this crossover to occur for our model .",
    "we also conjecture that a crossover between a bose mott insulator to a fermi mott insulator should take place with increasing bilayer separation , in analogy to the more commonly known bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "si units are used throughout this paper .",

    "for example , deformation potentials induced by surface acoustic waves @xcite and dipolar traps @xcite are type i potentials .",
    "meanwhile , the piezoelectric trapping technique @xcite is an example of a type ii trapping potential .",

    "the lack of the dependence on the wavelength @xmath7 is due to the cancellation of the dependence of the coulomb interaction energy @xmath128 and the kinetic energy @xmath129 .",
    "the wavelength @xmath7 is still important however , as it sets the energy scale of the whole bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the energy scale should be set such that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are larger than the temperature of the experiment , such that only the lowest energy band is occupied .",
    "furthermore , semiconductor systems possess an inevitable disorder potential due to reasons such as crystal imperfection and damage during fabrication , thus @xmath7 should be set small enough such that the hopping energy @xmath1 overcomes this disorder potential strength . for larger potentials than @xmath34",
    ", a lighter polariton mass is allowable for reaching the phase transition .",
    "thus in practice a combination of blue - detuned polaritons and large potentials is probably the most favorable experimental configuration .",

    "assuming that the lifetime of the very exciton - like polaritons can be approximated by typical exciton lifetimes @xmath140ns @xcite , this corresponds to an energy scale @xmath141ev .",
    "we thus see that for the above parameters the lifetime requirement is satisfied .    the coulomb interaction is increased for indirect excitons as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uandtplot ] .",
    "however , the increase is fairly modest for bilayer separations of the order of the bohr radius . thus considering that indirect excitons",
    "have not been observed to undergo bec yet , the moderate advantage of increased interactions ( at the sacrifice of a lighter polariton mass ) is outweighed by the difficulty of cooling the system into the ground state .",
    "the state of the polaritons may be measured using standard photoluminescence measurements that measure the coherence across the condensate @xcite . in analogy to the experiments of greiner _",
    "@xcite , the transition to the mott insulator state should lead to a lack of spatial coherence across the sample , resulting in the destruction of the far - field interference pattern .",
    "however , the disappearance of interference fringes does not unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a mott insulator , since an uncondensed state will also have the same interference characteristics .",
    "therefore , a second order coherence hanbury - brown - twiss measurement is also necessary to determine the correlations between the photons emanating from the sample . at unit filling in a mott insulator state , the conditional probability of detection of a photon originating from a particular site following detection from the same site vanishes .",
    "a similar diminished probability is present at higher filling factors .",
    "this is the identical technique used to observe anti - bunching behavior in single photon generation .",
    "we now turn to the effect on the particle statistics of indirect excitons as the bilayer separation is increased . for @xmath142 , excitons are well approximated by bosons for sufficiently low density , which motivated us to describe the system as a bose - hubbard model in section [ sec : periodic ] . in the limit @xmath143 , excitons can not be described by bosons , and are more properly described as a double fermi - hubbard model , with electron - hole interactions between them . since the two descriptions are rather different with differing phase transition criteria , it is of interest to know at what @xmath4 this crossover occurs .",

    "the operator @xmath149 may be interpreted as the correction operator to the commutation relation ( [ bcommutation ] ) , as it contains the non - bosonic component of the exciton operators .    due to the presence of the @xmath149 operator ,",
    "@xmath150-particle states defined using the @xmath151 operators defined in ( [ excitonoperator ] ) do not have the simple @xmath152 normalization of bosonic states .",

    "a derivation of this normalization factor is given in appendix [ app : bosefermi ] , up to powers linear in the correction operator @xmath154 .",

    "however , a reasonable criterion for the location of the crossover from bosonic to fermionic behavior may be defined as when the second term in the above expression becomes of the order of unity : @xmath165 the solution to the above criterion is plotted in fig .",

    "as @xmath33 is increased , the wannier functions become more localized , effectively reducing the area that the excitons are confined in .",
