    "recent developments in spectroscopy have led to very precise experimental values for the @xmath1 lamb shift and the rydberg constant  @xcite , so that now the lamb shift provides the best test of quantum electrodynamics for an atom .",
    "these achievements have spurred great theoretical efforts aimed at matching the current experimental accuracy ( for a review of the present status and recent developments in the theory of light hydrogenic atoms , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical prediction is expressed in terms of three small parameters : @xmath2 describing effects due to the binding of an electron to a nucleus of atomic number @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ( frequently accompanied by @xmath5 ) from electron selfinteractions ; and the ratio of electron to nucleus masses .",
    "the lamb shift is of the order @xmath6 ; all corrections through the second order in the small parameters are known , as well as some of the third order @xcite .",
    "another source of corrections is the spatial distribution of the nuclear charge . even for hydrogen , the experimental uncertainty in the measurement of the proton root mean",
    "square charge radius poses an obstacle for further theoretical progress .",
    "fortunately , measurements can be performed also with the muonic hydrogen whose spectrum is much more sensitive to the proton radius .",
    "a comparison of the theoretical prediction @xcite and anticipated new measurements @xcite is expected to soon improve the knowledge of this crucial parameter .",
    "in this paper we focus on the second - order radiative - nonrecoil contributions to the lamb shift of order @xmath0 . the total result for the corrections of this order",
    "was presented first in @xcite and improved in @xcite .",
    "our full result is compatible with the previous ones and has better precision . when comparing contributions from individual diagrams with @xcite , however , we find small discrepancies in some cases .",
    "in section  [ eval ] we present the details of our approach , and in section  [ res ] we present our results . in appendix  [ app ]",
    "we show the results for the master integrals , and in appendix  [ appb ] new analytic results for two diagrams .",
    "we consider an electron of mass @xmath7 orbiting a nucleus of mass @xmath8 and atomic number @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is assumed to be of such a size that @xmath9 is a reasonable expansion parameter .",
    "we are interested in corrections to the lamb shift of order @xmath0 and leading order in @xmath10 , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the squared modulus of the wave function of an @xmath13 bound state with principal quantum number @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the reduced mass of the system ) , and @xmath16 is the momentum space representation of the amplitude of the interaction between the electron and the nucleus at orders @xmath17 and @xmath18 . both particles are considered to be at rest and on their mass shell  @xcite .",
    "the correction @xmath19 is given by the sum of all the three - loop diagrams presented in figs .",
    "[ vacuum ] and [ other ] . in these figures",
    ", the continuous line represents the electron , and the dashed line represents the interaction with the nucleus .",
    "the reason for this is that for our purposes this interaction can be replaced by an effective propagator . in all diagrams ,",
    "the leading order in @xmath10 comes from the region where all the loop momenta scale like @xmath7 .",
    "the part of the diagrams representing the interaction between the electron and the nucleus at order @xmath20 is given by the sum of the direct and crossed two - photon exchange shown in fig .",
    "[ graphdelta ] . if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the loop and nucleus momenta , respectively , and @xmath23 , the sum of the nucleus propagators can be approximated at leading order by @xmath24 since the nucleus is considered to be at rest , this gives us a @xmath25 .",
    "together with the propagators of the two photons , this constitutes the effective propagator .",
    "we used dimensional regularization , and renormalized our results using the on - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "for all the photon propagators in figs .",
    "[ vacuum ] and [ other ] we used a general covariant @xmath26 gauge .",
    "the overall cancellation of the dependence on the gauge parameter in the final result provided us with a good check for our calculations . since the gauge invariance of the sum of the subdiagrams in fig .",
    "[ graphdelta ] is trivially and independently fulfilled , for the photonic part of the effective propagator we used the feynman gauge .",
    "the different sets of vacuum polarization diagrams .",
    "each set represents the drawn diagram plus all the possible permutations of its pieces . ]    the diagrams involving a two - loop electron self - interaction and vertex corrections . ]",
    "the sum of the direct and crossed diagrams is approximated by an effective propagator ( the double line represents the propagator of the nucleus ) . ]    since we are considering free asymptotic states with independent spins , the dirac structures of the electron and the nucleus factorize , and we simplify them by inserting each of the structures between the spinors of the initial and final states and averaging over the spins of the initial states .",
    "we use the program ` qgraf `  @xcite to generate all of the diagrams , and the packages ` q2e ` and ` exp `  @xcite to express them as a series of vertices and propagators that can be read by the ` form `  @xcite package ` matad  3 `  @xcite . finally , `",
    "matad  3 ` is used to represent the diagrams in terms of a set of scalar integrals using custom - made routines . in this way",
    ", we come to represent the amplitude @xmath27 in terms of about 18000 different scalar integrals .",
    "these integrals can be expressed in terms of a few master integrals by means of integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities  @xcite .",
    "using the so - called laporta algorithm @xcite as implemented in the ` mathematica ` package ` fire `  @xcite , we find 32 master integrals .. ]    since the program ` fire ` deals only with standard propagators , when using it we worked only with one of the nucleus propagators , instead of the dirac delta of the effective propagator .",
    "that is , instead of working with @xmath28 , we worked with @xmath29 , for example .",
    "working with just one of the propagators is enough for this purpose , as the ibp method is insensitive to the @xmath30 prescription ( remember from eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) that in our approximation this is the only difference between the two propagators ) . since each diagram in figs .",
    "[ vacuum ] and [ other ] represents the subtraction of two integrals that only differ in the nucleon propagator , when applying the ibp method we can set to zero any resulting integral in which the propagator @xmath29 disappears .",
    "this can be done because the same integral with the propagator @xmath31 instead would give the exact same contribution and thus the difference between the two is zero .",
    "once the reduction to master integrals is complete , we can simply substitute back the delta function in place of the nucleon propagator .    in order to calculate the master integrals , we turned the expressions in appendix  [ app ] into a representation in terms of feynman parameters .",
    "the procedure we then followed in most cases was to use a mellin - barnes representation  @xcite to break up sums of feynman parameters raised to non - integer powers and transform the integrals into integrals of gamma functions over the imaginary axis .",
    "in some cases , we were able to obtain analytical results .",
    "otherwise , we used the ` mathematica ` packages ` mb `  @xcite and ` mbresolve `  @xcite to perform a numerical calculation .    for integrals",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ app ] ) , the mellin - barnes representation was too cumbersome for a numerical evaluation . in these cases",
    "we used the ` mathematica ` package ` fiesta  1.2.1 `  @xcite with integrators from the ` cuba ` library  @xcite to perform numerical computations using sector decomposition @xcite . like ` fire ` , ` fiesta ` can only process standard propagators as input .",
    "this means that we had to use the momentum representation of the integrals with the nucleon propagators instead of the delta function .",
    "we separately calculated the integrals containing @xmath40 and the ones containing @xmath41 instead , and added the two results .",
    "we checked the method by computing with ` fiesta ` some integrals we had already found with ` mb ` and ` mbresolve ` .",
    "the results always agreed .",
    "there was one case , integral @xmath39 , where the ` fiesta ` result for the integral with @xmath41 was numerically unstable .",
    "fortunately , in this case we could find a representation in terms of feynman parameters that we could compute directly using ` cuba ` , without further treatment .",
    "this was possible because the integral is finite , and the representation was free of spurious divergences .",
    "we cross - checked this result using a beta version of ` fiesta  2 `  @xcite , which did not produce the instabilities we encountered in the former version .",
    "we performed an additional cross - check of our results by changing the basis of integrals . to do this",
    ", we took one of the integrals we computed with ` fiesta ` and used the ibp method to express it in terms of a similar integral of our choice ( same as the original one , but with some propagator(s ) raised to different powers ) plus other master integrals we already knew .",
    "we then computed the new integral with ` fiesta ` and checked if the final result for the lamb shift ( or for individual diagrams ) agreed with the calculation in the old basis .",
    "since changing the basis modifies the coefficients of all the integrals involved in the change , the agreement of the results obtained with different bases is a very good cross - check of our calculations .",
    "this cross - check was performed for several integrals . in particular , we changed integrals @xmath42 and @xmath36 , which are the ones limiting our precision , and integrals @xmath35 and @xmath39 . since the last two integrals contain most of the propagators for integral types @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", the corresponding changes of basis affect the coefficients of most of the other integrals of the respective type .",

    "for completeness , the known analytic results for sets ii and iii of the vacuum polarization diagrams are given in appendix  [ appb ] as well .",
    "it should be mentioned that the errors of the results in eqs .",
    "( [ vac ] ) , ( [ as ] ) , and ( [ total ] ) are not obtained from the sum of the errors of the diagrams in tables [ tvac ] and [ tother ] .",
    "once we decompose the problem into the calculation of master integrals , the diagrams are no longer independent , as the same master integral contributes to several different diagrams .",
    "thus , to find the error of our total result , we first sum all diagrams and then sum all the errors of the integrals in quadrature .",

    "we should stress again that our calculation is done using dimensional regularization while the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed in four dimensions . even though all the individual diagrams are finite , one can imagine situations where the two regularization methods give different partial results .",
    "however , we do not observe significant cancellations in the sum of the differences .",
    "thus , it seems the differences are real although practically negligible ; their sum is very small and amounts to @xmath65 , which is the error estimate in @xcite . thus our results agree within that error .",
    "we have applied particle theory methods to compute , in dimensional regularization and a general covariant gauge , the corrections of order @xmath0 to the lamb shift .",
    "we have made use of ibp techniques to reduce the problem of computing all the necessary feynman diagrams to the simpler problem of computing 32 scalar integrals .",
    "mellin - barnes integral representations and sector decomposition have then allowed us to obtain analytic results for some of these integrals , and good numerical results for the rest . with this , we have been able to reproduce and improve the results from previous calculations .",
