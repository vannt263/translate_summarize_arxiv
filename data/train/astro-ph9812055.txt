    "cosmic rays with energies up to 100 tev are thought to arise predominantly through shock acceleration by supernova remnants ( snr ) in our galaxy ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) .",
    "a fraction of the cosmic rays accelerated should interact within the supernova remnant and produce @xmath0rays ( drury et al .",
    "1994 , gaisser et al .",
    "1998 , baring et al . 1999 ) , and recent observations above 100 mev by the egret instrument on the compton gamma ray observatory have found @xmath0-ray signals associated with at least two supernova remnants  ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni ( esposito et al . 1996 )",
    ". however , brazier et al . (",
    "1996 ) have suggested that the @xmath0-ray emission from ic  443 may be associated with a pulsar within the remnant rather than the remnant itself .",
    "further evidence for acceleration in snr comes from the rossi x - ray timing explorer observations of cassiopeia a showing a non - thermal component in the spectrum ( allen et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the asca observation of non - thermal x  ray emission from sn  1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "reynolds ( 1996 ) and mastichiadis ( 1996 ) interpret the latter as synchrotron emission by electrons accelerated in the remnant up to energies as high as 100 tev , although donea and biermann ( 1998 ) suggest it may be bremsstrahlung from much lower energy electrons .",
    "the cangaroo telescope appears to have detected tev @xmath0-rays from sn1006 ( tanimori et al .",
    "1998 ) , while there has been a disappointing lack of detections of tev @xmath0-rays from ic443 and @xmath0  cygni .",
    "this may be related to the matter density in which the snr shocks propagate ( baring et al .",
    "1999 ) , higher densities yielding lower cut - off energies for ic443 and @xmath0  cygni .    acceleration to somewhat higher energies than 100 tev may be possible ( markiewicz et al . 1990 ) , but probably not to high enough energies to explain the smooth extension of the spectrum to 1 eev .",
    "several explanations for the origin of the cosmic rays in this energy range have been suggested : reacceleration of the supernova component while still inside the remnant ( axford 1991 ) ; by several supernovae exploding into a region evacuated by a pre - supernova star ( ip and axford 1991 ) ; or acceleration in shocks inside the strong winds from hot stars or groups of hot stars ( biermann and cassellini 1993 ) .",
    "very recently , an analysis of arrival direction data from agasa ( hayashida et al . 1998 ) shows excesses in the directions of the galactic centre and the cygnus region which could not easily be explained by charged particle propagation from these sources .",
    "if indeed the excess is due to these sources it may provide some evidence for a component of the cosmic rays at 1 eev being neutrons . at 5 eev the spectral slope changes , and there is evidence for a lightening in composition ( bird et al .",
    "1994 , dawson et al .",
    "1998 ) and it is likely this marks a change from galactic cosmic rays to extragalactic cosmic rays being dominant .    an alternative ,",
    "although less popular , scenario is that almost all cosmic ray nuclei are of extragalactic origin ( e.g. brecher and burbidge 1972 , and references therein ) . in any case , whether or not the lower energy cosmic rays are indeed galactic , at the highest energies ( above @xmath1  ev ) it is very probably extragalactic .",
    "the cosmic ray air shower events with the highest energies so far detected have energies of @xmath2 gev ( hayashida et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath3 gev ( bird et al .",
    "1995 ) , and recent results from agasa have shown there to be a continuous spectrum between @xmath4 gev and @xmath3 gev ( takeda et al .",
    "the question of the origin of these cosmic rays having energy significantly above @xmath4 gev is complicated by propagation of such energetic particles through the universe .",
    "nucleons interact with the cosmic background radiation fields , losing energy by bethe - heitler pair production , or interacting by pion photoproduction , and in the latter case may emerge as either protons or neutrons with reduced energy .",
    "the threshold for pion photoproduction on the microwave background is @xmath5 gev , and at @xmath3 gev the energy - loss distance is about 20 mpc .",
    "propagation of cosmic rays over substantially larger distances gives rise to a cut - off in the spectrum at @xmath6 gev as was first shown by greisen ( 1966 ) , and zatsepin and kuzmin ( 1966 ) , the `` gzk cut - off '' , and a corresponding pile - up at slightly lower energy ( hill and schramm 1985 , berezinsky and grigoreva 1988 ) .",
    "these processes occur not only during propagation , but also during acceleration , and may actually limit the maximum energies particles can achieve .    in this chapter",
    "i give an overview of shock acceleration , describe interactions of high energy protons and nuclei with radiation , discuss maximum energies obtainable during acceleration , and the shape of the spectrum near maximum energy , outline propagation of cosmic rays through the background radiation and the consequent electron - photon cascading , and finally discuss conventional and exotic models of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "interactions of cosmic rays with radiation are important both during acceleration when the resulting energy losses compete with energy gains by , for example , shock acceleration , and during propagation from the acceleration region to the observer . for ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ,",
    "the most important processes are pion photoproduction and bethe - heitler pair production both on the microwave background , and synchrotron radiation . in the case of nuclei ,",
    "photodisintegration on the microwave background is important . in this section",
    ", i shall describe how to calculate the mean free path for such interactions , and briefly discuss how to simulate the interactions using the monte carlo method .",
    "the mean interaction length , @xmath7 , of a proton of energy @xmath8 is given by , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the differential photon number density of photons of energy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the appropriate total cross section for the process in question for a centre of momentum ( cm ) frame energy squared , @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angle between the directions of the proton and photon , and @xmath16 is the proton s velocity .    for pion photoproduction @xmath17 and @xmath18 for photon - proton pair - production",
    "the threshold is somewhat lower , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for both processes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 corresponds to a head - on collision of a proton of energy @xmath8 and a photon of energy @xmath11 .",
    "examination of the integrand in equation [ eq : mpl ] shows that the energy of the soft photon interacting with a proton of energy @xmath8 is distributed as @xmath23 in the range @xmath24 where @xmath25 similarly , examination of the integrand in equation [ eq : mpl ] shows that the square of the total cm frame energy is distributed as @xmath26 in the range @xmath27 .",
    "the monte carlo rejection technique can be used to sample @xmath11 and @xmath13 respectively from the two distributions , and equation [ eq : s ] is used to find @xmath15 .",
    "one then lorentz transforms the interacting particles to the frame in which the interaction is treated ( usually the proton rest frame ) , and samples momenta of particles produced in the interaction from the appropriate differential cross section by the rejection method .",
    "the energies of produced particles are then lorentz transformed to the laboratory frame , and the final energy of the proton is obtained by requiring energy conservation . in this procedure , it is not always possible to achieve exact conservation of both momentum and energy while sampling particles from inclusive differential cross sections ( e.g. multiple pion production well above threshold ) , and the momentum of the last particle sampled is therefore adjusted to minimize the error .",
    "the mean interaction lengths for both processes , @xmath28 , are obtained from equation [ eq : mpl ] for interactions in the microwave background and are plotted as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgpiee3k_xloss ] . dividing by the inelasticity , @xmath29 , one obtains the energy - loss distances for the two processes , @xmath30      in the case of nuclei",
    "the situation is a little more complicated .",
    "the threshold condition for bethe - heitler pair production can be expressed as @xmath31 and the threshold condition for pion photoproduction can be expressed as @xmath32 since @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass number , we will need to shift both energy - loss distance curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgpiee3k_xloss ] to higher energies by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "we shall also need to shift the curves up or down as discussed below .    for bethe - heitler pair production",
    "the energy lost by a nucleus in each collision near threshold is approximately @xmath35 .",
    "hence the inelasticity is @xmath36 and is a factor of @xmath34 lower than for protons . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section goes like @xmath37 , so the overall shift is down ( to lower energy - loss distance ) by @xmath38 .",
    "for example , for iron nuclei the energy loss distance for pair production is reduced by a factor @xmath39 .    for pion production",
    "the energy lost by a nucleus in each collision near threshold is approximately @xmath40 , and so , as for pair production , the inelasticity is factor @xmath34 lower than for protons .",
    "the cross section increases approximately as @xmath41 giving an overall increase in the energy loss distance for pion production of a factor @xmath42 for iron nuclei .",
    "the energy loss distances for pair production and pion photoproduction are shown for iron nuclei in fig .",
    "[ fig : fepiee_xloss ] .",
    "photodisintegration is very important and has been considered in detail by tkaczyk et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , puget et al . ( 1976 ) , karakula and tkaczyk ( 1993 ) , epele and roulet ( 1998 ) and stecker and salamon ( 1999 ) .",
    "the photodisintegration distance defined by @xmath43 taken from stecker and salamon ( 1999 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fepiee_xloss ] together with an estimate made over a larger range of energy by protheroe ( unpublished ) of the total loss distance based on photodisintegration cross sections of karakula and tkaczyk ( 1993 ) .",
    "since iron nuclei will be fragmented during pion photoproduction , the photodisintegration distance of fe at high energies should be consistent with @xmath44 _ the mean free path _ for pion photoproduction by fe at higher energies , and this is found to be the case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fepiee_xloss ] ) .",
    "for stochastic particle acceleration by electric fields induced by motion of magnetic fields @xmath45 , the rate of energy gain by relativistic particles of charge @xmath46 can be written ( in si units ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 and depends on the acceleration mechanism .",
    "i shall give a simple heuristic treatment of fermi acceleration based on that given in gaisser s excellent book ( gaisser 1990 ) .",
    "i shall start with 2nd order fermi acceleration ( fermi s original theory ) and describe how this can be modified in the context of astrophysical shocks into the more efficient 1st order fermi mechanism known as shock acceleration .",
    "more detailed and rigorous treatments are given in several review articles ( drury 1983a , blandford and eichler 1987 , berezhko and krymsky 1988 ) .",
    "see the review by jones and ellison ( 1991 ) on the plasma physics of shock acceleration which also includes a brief historical review and refers to early work .",
    "gas clouds in the interstellar medium have random velocities of @xmath49 km / s superimposed on their regular motion around the galaxy .",
    "cosmic rays gain energy on average when scattering off these magnetized clouds .",
    "a cosmic ray enters a cloud and scatters off irregularities in the magnetic field which is tied to the cloud because it is partly ionized .    in the frame of the cloud : ( a ) there is no change in energy because the scattering is collisionless , and so there is elastic scattering between the cosmic ray and the cloud as a whole which is much more massive than the cosmic ray ; ( b ) the cosmic ray s direction is randomized by the scattering and it emerges from the cloud in a random direction .",
    "consider a cosmic ray entering a cloud with energy @xmath50 and momentum @xmath51 travelling in a direction making angle @xmath52 with the cloud s direction .",
    "after scattering inside the cloud , it emerges with energy @xmath53 and momentum @xmath54 at angle @xmath55 to the cloud s direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_acc_orig ] ) .",
    "the energy change is obtained by applying the lorentz transformations between the laboratory frame ( unprimed ) and the cloud frame ( primed ) . transforming to the cloud frame : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    transforming to the laboratory frame : @xmath59    the scattering is collisionless , being with the magnetic field . since the magnetic field",
    "is tied to the cloud , and the cloud is very massive , in the cloud s rest frame there is no change in energy , @xmath60 , and hence we obtain the fractional change in lab - frame energy @xmath61 , @xmath62    we need to obtain average values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . inside the cloud ,",
    "the cosmic ray scatters off magnetic irregularities many times so that its direction is randomized , @xmath65 the average value of cos@xmath52 depends on the rate at which cosmic rays collide with clouds at different angles .",
    "the rate of collision is proportional to the relative velocity between the cloud and the particle so that the probability per unit solid angle of having a collision at angle @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "hence , for ultrarelativistic particles ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68 and we obtain @xmath69 giving @xmath70 since @xmath71 .",
    "we see that @xmath72 is positive ( energy gain ) , but is 2nd order in @xmath73 and because @xmath71 the average energy gain is very small .",
    "this is because there are almost as many overtaking collisions ( energy loss ) as there are head - on collisions ( energy gain ) .",
    "fermi s original theory was modified in the 1970 s ( axford , lear and skadron 1977 , krymsky 1977 , bell 1978 , blandford and ostriker 1978 ) to describe more efficient acceleration ( 1st order in @xmath73 ) taking place at supernova shocks but is generally applicable to strong shocks in other astrophysical contexts .",
    "our discussion of shock acceleration will be of necessity brief , and omit a number of subtleties .    here ,",
    "for simplicity , we adopt the test particle approach ( neglecting effects of cosmic ray pressure on the shock profile ) , adopt a plane geometry and consider only non - relativistic shocks .",
    "nevertheless , the basic concepts will be described in sufficient detail that we can consider acceleration and interactions of the highest energy cosmic rays , and to what energies they can be accelerated .",
    "we consider the classic example of a sn shock , although the discussion applies equally to other shocks . during a supernova explosion several solar masses of material",
    "are ejected at a speed of @xmath74 km / s which is much faster than the speed of sound in the interstellar medium ( ism ) which is @xmath75 10 km / s . a strong shock wave propagates radially out as the ism and its associated magnetic field piles up in front of the supernova ejecta .",
    "the velocity of the shock , @xmath76 , depends on the velocity of the ejecta , @xmath77 , and on the ratio of specific heats , @xmath0 through the compression ratio , @xmath78 , @xmath79 for sn shocks the sn will have ionized the surrounding gas which will therefore be monatomic ( @xmath80 ) , and theory of shock hydrodynamics shows that for @xmath80 a strong shock will have @xmath81 .",
    "in order to work out the energy gain per shock crossing , we can visualize magnetic irregularities on either side of the shock as clouds of magnetized plasma of fermi s original theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_acc_shock ] ) . by considering the rate at which cosmic rays cross the shock from downstream to upstream , and upstream to downstream",
    ", one finds @xmath82 and @xmath83 , giving @xmath84 note this is 1st order in @xmath85 and is therefore more efficient than fermi s original theory .",
    "this is because of the converging flow ",
    "whichever side of the shock you are on , if you are moving with the plasma , the plasma on the other side of the shock is approaching you at speed @xmath86 .    to obtain the energy spectrum we need to find the probability of a cosmic ray encountering the shock once , twice , three times , etc .",
    "if we look at the diffusion of a cosmic ray as seen in the rest frame of the shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : up_downstream ] ) , there is clearly a net flow of the energetic particle population in the downstream direction .",
    "the net flow rate downstream gives the rate at which cosmic rays are lost downstream @xmath87 since cosmic rays with number density @xmath88 at the shock are advected downstream with speed @xmath89 ( from right to left in fig .",
    "[ fig : up_downstream ] ) and we have neglected relativistic transformations of the rates because @xmath90 .",
    "upstream of the shock , cosmic rays travelling at speed @xmath91 at angle @xmath15 to the shock normal ( as seen in the laboratory frame ) approach the shock with speed @xmath92 as seen in the shock frame . clearly , to cross the shock ,",
    "then , assuming cosmic rays upstream are isotropic , the rate at which they cross from upstream to downstream is @xmath94    the probability of crossing the shock once and then escaping from the shock ( being lost downstream ) is the ratio of these two rates : @xmath95 the probability of returning to the shock after crossing from upstream to downstream is @xmath96 and so the probability of returning to the shock @xmath97 times and also of crossing the shock at least @xmath97 times is @xmath98^{k}.\\ ] ] hence , the energy after @xmath97 shock crossings is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the initial energy .    to derive the spectrum",

    "the observed cosmic ray spectrum is steepened by energy - dependent escape of cosmic rays from the galaxy .      for simplicity ,",
    "we have neglected the effect of cosmic ray pressure on the shock which can alter the shock profile .",
    "the original method of treating this non - linear effect is the two - fluid method , the two - fluids being plasma and cosmic rays , and this is reviewed by drury  ( 1983b ) .",
    "the shock profile , instead of being a step - function becomes smoothed , and this affects the acceleration of low and high energy particles differently .",
    "lower energy particles with short diffusion mean free paths spanning only part of the shock profile ( i.e. effectively seeing a lower @xmath78 ) will have a steeper spectrum , while high energy particles with longer diffusion mean free paths spanning most of the shock profile ( i.e. effectively seeing a higher @xmath78 ) will have a flatter spectrum .",
    "the net result of this is a spectrum with upward curvature .",
    "in addition , as a result of the cosmic ray pressure far downstream providing additional slowing of the plasma , the overall compression ratio from far upstream to far downstream may be even higher than in the test particle case giving an even flatter spectrum for the highest energy particles ( ellison and eichler 1984 ; see baring 1997 for a brief review and additional references ) .",
    "shocks in jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are likely to be relativistic , i.e. @xmath109 .",
    "this will affect the acceleration in two ways : ( a ) the adiabatic index of a relativistic gas is @xmath110 giving @xmath111 for a strong shock , and so one would expect from eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] a flatter spectrum with @xmath112 .",
    "however , for relativistic plasma motion with bulk velocities comparable to those of the particles being accelerated , the approximations used to derive eqns .",
    "[ eq : r_loss ] and  [ eq : r_cross ] are no longer valid , the escape probability being greater and the particles being anisotropic , with the result that @xmath113 .",
    "detailed studies have shown a trend in which shocks with larger @xmath114 generally have lower @xmath115  ( kirk and schneider 1987 , ellison and jones 1990 )",
    ". however , the spectral index is very sensitive to the pitch angle ( see baring 1997 for additional references ) .",
    "here we again neglect effects of cosmic ray pressure and consider only a non - relativistic shock .",
    "the acceleration rate is defined by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the time for one complete cycle , i.e. from crossing the shock from upstream to downstream , diffusing back towards the shock and crossing from downstream to upstream , and finally returning to the shock .    the rate of loss of accelerated particles downstream is the probability of escape per shock crossing divided by the cycle time @xmath118    we see immediately that the ratio of the escape rate to the acceleration rate depends on the compression ratio @xmath119 and for a strong shock ( @xmath81 ) the two rates are equal .",
    "as we shall see later , a consequence of this is that the asymptotic spectrum of particles accelerated by a strong shock is the well - known @xmath108 power - law .",
    "we shall discuss these processes in the shock frame ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : up_downstream ] ) and consider first particles crossing the shock from upstream to downstream and diffusing back to the shock , i.e.  we shall work out the average time spent downstream . since we are considering non - relativistic shocks , the time scales are approximately the same in the upstream and downstream plasma frames , and so in this section i shall drop the use of subscripts indicating the frame of reference .",
    "diffusion takes place in the presence of advection at speed @xmath120 in the downstream direction .",
    "the typical distance a particle diffuses in time t is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the diffusion coefficient in the downstream region .",
    "the distance advected in this time is simply @xmath123 .",
    "if @xmath124 the particle has a very high probability of returning to the shock , and if @xmath125 the particle has a very high probability of never returning to the shock ( i.e. it has effectively escaped downstream ) .",
    "so , we set @xmath126 to define a distance @xmath127 downstream of the shock which is effectively a boundary between the region closer to the shock where the particles will usually return to the shock and the region farther from the shock in which the particles will usually be advected downstream never to return",
    ". there are @xmath128 particles per unit area of shock between the shock and this boundary . dividing this by @xmath129 we obtain the average time spent downstream before returning to the shock @xmath130",
    "consider next the other half of the cycle after the particle has crossed the shock from downstream to upstream until it returns to the shock . in this case",
    "we can define a boundary at a distance @xmath131 upstream of the shock such that nearly all particles upstream of this boundary have never encountered the shock , and nearly all the particles between this boundary and the shock have diffused there from the shock . then dividing the number of particles per unit area of shock between the shock and this boundary , @xmath132 , by @xmath129 we obtain the average time spent upstream before returning to the shock @xmath133 and hence the cycle time @xmath134    the acceleration rate",
    "is then given by @xmath135 assuming that the diffusion coefficients upstream and downstream have the same power - law dependence on energy , e.g. , @xmath136 then the acceleration rate also has a power - law dependence @xmath137 note that more correctly , the diffusion coefficient will be a function of magnetic rigidity , @xmath138 , which , for ultra - relativistic particles considered in this paper , is approximately equal to @xmath139 where @xmath46 is the charge .",
    "however , here we are mainly concerned with singly charged particles and shall work in terms of @xmath8 rather than rigidity .",
    "we next consider the diffusion for the cases of parallel , oblique , and perpendicular shocks , and estimate the maximum acceleration rate for these cases .",
    "the diffusion coefficients required , @xmath140 and @xmath122 , are the coefficients for diffusion parallel to the shock normal .",

    "the radiation length changes as @xmath286 , where @xmath287 gev , and @xmath288 is the standard bethe - heitler radiation length in cm ( stanev et al . 1982 ) .",
    "protheroe and stanev ( 1996 ) found that average shower maximum will be reached below sea level for energies @xmath289 gev , @xmath290 gev , and @xmath291 gev for @xmath0rays entering the atmosphere at @xmath292 = 1 , 0.75 , and 0.5 respectively .",
    "such showers would be very difficult to reconstruct by experiments such as fly s eye and at best would be assigned a lower energy .    before entering the earth s atmosphere @xmath0-rays and electrons are likely to interact on the geomagnetic field ( see erber ( 1968 ) for a review of the theoretical and experimental understanding of the interactions ) .",
    "in such a case the @xmath0-rays propagating perpendicular to the geomagnetic field lines would cascade in the geomagnetic field , i.e. pair production followed by synchrotron radiation .",
    "the cascade process would degrade the @xmath0-ray energies to some extent ( depending on pitch angle ) , and the atmospheric cascade would then be generated by a bunch of @xmath0-rays of lower energy .",
    "aharonian et al . (",
    "1991 ) have considered this possibility and conclude that this bunch would appear as one air shower , having the energy of the initial gamma - ray outside the geomagnetic field , being made up of the superposition of many air showers of lower energy where the lpm effect is negligible .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath0-rays above 300 eev would be observable by fly s eye , etc .",
    "there is however , some uncertainty as to whether pair production will take place in the geomagnetic field .",
    "this depends on whether the geomagnetic field spatial dimension is larger than the formation length of the electron pair , i.e. the length required to achieve a separation between the two electrons that is greater than the classical radius of the electron ( see also stanev and vankov 1996 ) .",
    "at low energies , propagation of cosmic rays through the galaxy smears out their arrival directions , giving rise to an almost isotropic distribution .",
    "however , simulations of cosmic rays through a model of the galactic magnetic field including a turbulent component shows that for energies greater than @xmath293z  eev significant anisotropies may be expected from sources in our galaxy ( see , e.g. , lee and clay 1995 ) .",
    "clearly , at much higher energies the magnetic field of our galaxy plays an insignificant role in smearing directions of extragalactic cosmic ray nuclei .",
    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays can be subject , however , to significant deflection and energy dependent time delays in large scale extragalactic or halo magnetic fields .",
    "lemoine et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have performed monte carlo simulations of propagation which show how the duration of cosmic ray emission in distant sources has a dramatic effect on the observed spectrum .",
    "for example , in one model , a bursting source at 30  mpc with an @xmath108 spectrum gave a spectrum very strongly peaked at 110 eev .",
    "ryu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) consider the possibility that the cosmic magnetic field , instead of being uniformly distributed , is strongly correlated with the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "they derive an upper limit to the magnetic field in filaments and sheets of @xmath294 which is @xmath295 times higher than the previously quoted values . clearly , if such cosmic structures have high magnetic fields this will have important consequences for cosmic ray acceleration and propagation .",
    "for example , tanco ( 1998b ) has considered propagation through well ordered compressed magnetic fields ( @xmath296 g ) inside cosmological walls and found the cosmic ray flux leaving a wall to be highly anisotropic ( by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude ) , being greatest near the central perpendicular of the wall .",
    "thus , we might expect an anisotropy in the direction perpendicular to the nearest cosmological wall ( centaurus ) .",
    "he also found that arrival directions of cr are smeared , and correlations between @xmath0-rays and cr in bursting events are lost .",
    "sigl , lemoine and biermann ( 1998 ) have considered propagation in the local supercluster with @xmath297 g , with a maximum eddy length of 10  mpc and a distance to the nearest source of 10  mpc . for a soft injection spectrum , @xmath298 , and with both the source and the observer in the local supercluster ( sheet with thickness 10  mpc ) they found excellent agreement with the spectrum observed above 10 eev .",
    "below 100 eev cosmic rays diffuse , with arrival directions at earth being spread out over @xmath299 while above 200 eev they are just deflected but still have a significant spread in arrival directions of @xmath300 explaining the lack of correlation of the highest energy cosmic ray with any known nearby source .",
    "tanco ( 1998a ) noted that the local distribution of luminous matter is far from uniform , and using a redshift distribution based on the cfa redshift catalog they found agreement with the observed super - gzk spectrum .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by blasi and olinto ( 1998 ) .",
    "while the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays remains uncertain , there appears to be no necessity to invoke exotic models .",
    "shock acceleration , which is believed to be responsible for the cosmic rays up to at least 100 gev , is a well - understood mechanism and there is evidence of shock acceleration taking place in radio galaxies ( biermann and strittmatter 1987 ) , and the conditions there are favourable for acceleration to at least 300 eev .",
    "such a model , in which cosmic rays are accelerated in fanaroff - riley class ii radio galaxies , can readily account for the flat component of cosmic rays which dominates the spectrum above @xmath301 eev ( rachen et al .",
    "1993 ) . indeed , one of the brightest fr",
    "ii galaxies , 3c 134 , is a candidate source for the 300 eev fly s eye event ( biermann , 1997 ) .",
    "whatever the source of the highest energy cosmic rays , because of their interactions with the radiation and magnetic fields in the universe , the cosmic rays reaching earth will have spectra , composition and arrival directions affected by propagation .",
    "in particular the composition of the arriving particles may differ drasticly from that on acceleration .",
    "for example , the accompanying fluxes of neutrinos produced in the sources and by cascade processes during propagation to earth may dominate the spectrum at highest energies .",
    "the astrophysics ingredients to the propagation ( e.g. , magnetic field intensities and configurations ) are still somewhat uncertain , and we need better statistics on the arrival directions , energy spectra and composition , as well as the intensity of the diffuse backgrounds of very high energy neutrinos and @xmath0-rays ( partly produced in cascades initiated by cosmic ray interactions ) .    the auger project ( auger collaboration 1995 ) , an international collaboration to build two uhe cosmic ray detectors , one in the united states and one in argentina , each having a collecting area of about 3000 km@xmath302 , and will measure the energy spectrum and anisotropy of the highest energy cosmic rays with the required precision , and will also be sensitive to extremely high energy neutrinos ( capelle et al . 1998 ) . the next generation neutrino telescopes , such as the planned extension of amanda , icecube ( shi et al 1998 ) , and antares ( blanc et al .",
    "1997 ) , may have effective areas of 0.1  km@xmath303 , or larger , and be sufficiently sensitive to detect bursts of neutrinos from extragalactic objects and to map out the spectrum of the diffuse high energy neutrino background .",
    "once we have better better statistics of particle fluxes we will be better placed to understand the origin of the highest energy particles occurring in nature . furthermore , once the astrophysics is worked out , cosmic rays will be the tool for exploring particle physics well above terrestrial accelerator energies .",
    "this chapter is based in part on a lecture given at erice ( protheroe 1996 ) .",

    "<S> in this chapter i give an overview of shock acceleration , including a discussion of the maximum energies possible and the shape of the spectrum near cut - off , interactions of high energy cosmic rays with , and propagation through , the background radiation , and the resulting electron - photon cascade . </S>",
    "<S> possible sources of the highest energy cosmic rays are discussed including active galaxies , gamma ray bursts and topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> i argue that while the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still uncertain , it is not necessary to invoke exotic models such as emission by topological defects to explain the existing data . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that shock acceleration at fanaroff - riley class ii radio galaxies can account for the existing data . </S>",
    "<S> however , new cosmic ray data , as well as better estimates of the extragalactic radiation fields and magnetic fields will be necessary before we will be certain of the origin of the highest energy particles occurring in nature .    </S>",
