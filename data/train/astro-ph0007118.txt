    "hard x - ray observations are the most efficient way of tracing emission due to accretion mechanisms , such in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . hard x - ray selection is less affected by strong biases present at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , a column of a few times @xmath6 @xmath5 has negligible effect in the 5 - 10 kev band , while it reduces by @xmath7 times nuclear emission below 2 kev .",
    "soft x - ray surveys ( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "1998 , schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) are also often contaminated by non nuclear components , like emission from binaries and/or from optically thin plasmas in star - formation regions surrounding the nucleus .",
    "optical and uv color selection is biased against objects with even modest extinction or an intrinsically ` red ' emission spectrum ( see e.g. vignali et al .",
    "sensitive hard x - ray surveys are therefore powerful tools to select large samples of agn less biased against absorption and extinction .",
    "our approach consists in taking advantage of the large field of view and good sensitivity of the bepposax mecs instrument ( boella et al .",
    "1997a , b ) to survey tens to hundreds of square degrees at fluxes @xmath8 ( fiore et al .",
    "2000a ) , and using higher sensitivity xmm - newton and chandra observations to extend the survey down to @xmath9 on several deg@xmath0 ( at this flux the majority of the hard xrb is resolved in sources ) .",
    "the results on the optical identification of a sample of faint chandra sources discovered over the first 0.14 deg@xmath0 have been published by fiore et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "this approach is complementary to deep pencil beam surveys ( @xmath10 deg@xmath0 , see e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 , hornschemeier et al .",
    "2000 ) , and we cover a different portion of the redshift  luminosity plane . our purpose is to study cosmic source populations at fluxes where a reasonably large fraction of the hard xrb is resolved ( 20 - 30% at the bepposax flux limit ) , but where the x - ray flux is high enough to provide x - ray spectral information in higher sensitivity follow - up observations .",
    "this would allow the determination of the distribution of absorbing columns in the sources making the hard xrb , providing strong constraints on agn synthesis models for the xrb .",
    "furthermore , large area surveys allow the search for previously ` rare ' agn , like ` red ' quasars or other minority agn populations ( kim & elvis 1999 ) and quantify their fractional contribution to the agn family .",
    "finally , at our x - ray flux limits the optical counterparts are bright enough to allow relatively high quality optical spectroscopy , useful to investigate the physics of the sources .",
    "the high energy large area survey ( hellas ) has been performed in the 4.5 - 10 kev band because : a ) this is the band closest to the maximum of the xrb energy density which is reachable with the current imaging x - ray telescopes , and b ) the bepposax mecs point spread function ( psf ) greatly improves with energy , providing a 95 % error radius of 1@xmath11 in the hard band ( fiore et al .",
    "2000a ) , allowing optical identification of the x - ray sources .",
    "about 80 deg@xmath0 of sky have been surveyed so far using 142 bepposax mecs fielda at @xmath12 deg .",
    "( fields centered on bright extended sources and bright galactic sources were excluded from the survey , as well as fields close to lmc , smc and m33 . )",
    "a robust detection algorithm has been used in coadded mecs1+mecs2+mecs3 ( or mecs2+mecs3 for observations performed after the failure of the mecs1 unit ) 4.5 - 10 kev images .",
    "the method consists in first convolving the x - ray image with a wavelet function , to smooth the image and increase contrast , and then in running a standard slide - cell detection method on the smoothed image , to locate count excesses above the local background .",
    "the statistics of each candidate detection is then accurately studied and the final net counts are estimated from the original ( un - smoothed ) image to preserve poisson statistics .",
    "the background is calculated using source - free boxes near the source region .",
    "the detection has been run several time for each field , changing the size of the wavelet function , to a ) take into account the variation of the mecs psf with the offaxis angle , and b ) to detect efficiently sources with variable extension .",
    "the quality of the detection has always been checked interactively .",
    "we used a probability threshold of 99.94 % ( about 3.5 @xmath13 ) .",
    "sources detected in regions of radius 4 , 6 or 8 arcmin around targets ( depending on the target brightness ) have been excluded from the sample , which includes a total of 147 sources down to a 5 - 10 kev flux of @xmath14 .",
    "count rates were converted to fluxes using a fixed conversion factor equal to 7.8@xmath15 ( 5 - 10 kev flux ) per one `` 3 mecs count '' ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "this factor is appropriate for a power law spectrum with @xmath16 , but due to the narrow band it is not strongly sensitive to the spectral shape : for @xmath17 and 0.8 it is 8.1 and 7.6 @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the skycoverage varies from @xmath18 deg@xmath0 at @xmath19 to 6.6 , 50 and 84 deg@xmath0 at fluxes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . after correcting for this skycoverage",
    "we find 16.9@xmath223.0(6.4 ) sources deg@xmath23 at @xmath24 ( fiore et al .",
    "2000a , comastri et al . 2000 ) .",
    "first quoted errors are the @xmath25 statistical confidence interval .",
    "errors in brackets include systematic uncertainties , due to the lack of knowledge of the real spectrum of the faint sources .",
    "this logn - logs corresponds to a resolved fraction of the 5 - 10 xrb equal to 20 - 30 % , depending on the xrb normalization ( comastri this meeting , vecchi et al .",
    "the observed number counts are consistent , within the errors , with the extrapolations from the bepposax ( giommi et al 2000 ) and asca ( cagnoni et al .",

    "to study the spectral variety of the hellas sources we have calculated for each source the softness ratio ( s - h)/(s+h ) , s=1.3 - 4.5 kev , h=4.5 - 10 kev .",
    "figure 1 plots ( s - h)/(s+h ) as a function of source total 5 - 10 kev flux .",
    "sources under or close to the berillium strongback supporting the mecs window have been excluded from this analysis , because their observed softness may be systematically lower than real .",
    "the number of the remaining sources in the sample is 126 .",
    "many of the hellas sources have a low ( s - h)/(s+h ) , indicating a hard spectrum .",
    "assuming @xmath16 , we find that 36(5 ) of the 126 sources have 1.3 - 4.5 kev count rates lower than that expected at confidence level @xmath27 .",
    "large absorbing columns densities are likely responsible for the hard spectrum of these sources .",
    "a deficit of very hard sources at fluxes @xmath28 is also evident in figure 1 .",
    "this can be due to both an astrophysical and a technical reason .",
    "the first is a redshift effect : the observed softness ratio of sources with similar intrinsic absorbing column density increases with the redshift , as the observed cut - off energy moves toward lower energies .",
    "the second is the mecs reduced sensitivity to hard sources , due to the rapid increase of the vignetting of the telescopes with the energy and with the off - axis angle . to quantify the latter effect we have computed loci of equal 4.5 - 10 kev count rate for a given flux , shown by dashed lines in figure 1 .",
    "the strong curvature of these lines toward low values of ( s - h)/(s+h ) indicate that a large part of the deficit of faint hard sources is probably due to this effect .",
    "the curves are bent toward high flux values at high ( s - h)/(s+h ) too , because the mecs sensitivity is reduced for very soft sources by the berillium window , which absorbs most photons below @xmath29 kev .",
    "the 4.5 - 10 kev sensitivity is maximum for an unabsorbed power law spectrum of @xmath30 .",
    "correlations of the hellas source catalog with catalogs of cosmic sources provide 26 coincidences ( 7 radio - loud agn , 13 radio - quiet agn , 6 clusters of galaxies ) , suggesting that most of the hellas sources are agn .",

    "r of broad line agn are different ( at the @xmath37 level ) from that of narrow line agn , which , on average , have a lower ( s - h)/(s+h ) , and are therefore likely to be more x - ray absorbed , and an higher b  ",

    "the ( s - h)/(s+h ) of the 24 broad line agns is marginally anticorrelated with z ( spearman rank correlation coefficent of -0.364 for 22 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a probability of 92% ) . the number of sources is not large enough to reach a definite conclusion , but it is interesting to note that this correlation goes in the opposite direction than expected .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the optical depth in the optical band , due to dust extinction , to that in the x - ray band , due to photoelectric absorption , should scale as @xmath42 .",
    "highly x - ray obscured broad line blue continuum quasar can exist only if their dust to gas ratio or their dust composition strongly differs from the galactic one ( also see maiolino , this meeting ) .",

    ", this suggests that roughly one third of the hard x - ray background is due to sources similar to local seyferts and quasars .",

    "agn contribution is observed in the k band , especially in the 2 ` red ' quasar .",
    "this means that many , if not most of the objects making the hard x - ray background can not be distinguished from normal galaxies using optical and near - ir photometry .",
    "in fact only the 4 broad line blue quasar would have passed the color criterion of the pg catalog , thus indicating that a large fraction of the accretion power in the universe may actually have been missed in optical color survey such as the bqs ( u    b@xmath44 ) .",
    "multicolor photometry techniques based on galaxy templates ( e.g. giallongo et al . 1998 ) may be efficiently used to assess the redshift of the hard x - ray selected sources .",
