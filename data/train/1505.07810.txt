    "<S> recently much effort has been made towards the introduction of non - hermitian random matrix models respecting @xmath0-symmetry . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between complex @xmath0-symmetric matrices and split - complex and split - quaternionic versions of hermitian matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two new random matrix ensembles of ( a ) gaussian split - complex hermitian , and ( b ) gaussian split - quaternionic hermitian matrices , of arbitrary sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that these ensembles represent universality classes for @xmath0-symmetric matrices . for the case of @xmath1 matrices </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic expressions for the joint probability distributions of the eigenvalues , the one - level densities and the level spacings in the case of real eigenvalues .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> there has been a surge of research interest in @xmath0-symmetric quantum theories , accompanied by a multitude of experimental applications and realisations @xcite . for finite - dimensional systems represented by matrices </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0-symmetry is equivalent to the reality of the characteristic polynomial @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath0-symmetric matrices have either real or complex conjugate eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> their eigenvectors are orthogonal with respect to a suitably defined @xmath2 inner product @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been conjectured that @xmath0-symmetry is closely related to split - quaternionic extensions of quantum theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that split - quaternionic extensions of hermitian matrices are indeed a natural representation of @xmath0-symmetric matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this equivalence allows us to introduce new @xmath0-symmetric random matrix ensembles .    in conventional quantum systems , </S>",
    "<S> random matrices play an important role due to their ability to describe spectral fluctuations in sufficiently complicated systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the famous bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture states that the spectral fluctuations of quantum systems with chaotic classical counterparts are similar to those of certain random matrices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are three important universality classes for hermitian quantum systems , depending on the time - reversal properties of the system , corresponding to the gaussian orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic ensembles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - hermitian random matrix models , on the other hand , whose eigenvalues are in general complex , are widely studied , and have applications ranging from dissipative quantum systems and scattering theory to quantum chromodynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> several attempts towards defining @xmath0-symmetric random matrices and identifying universality classes for @xmath0-symmetric systems have been made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of them are restricted to @xmath3 matrices , due to the lack of a natural parameterisation of larger @xmath0-symmetric matrices . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the split - complex and split - quaternionic versions of the gaussian unitary and symplectic ensembles as candidates for representing new universality classes for @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the new ensembles are invariant under orthogonal and unitary transformations , reflecting the invariance of split - complex and split - quaternionic hermitian matrices , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the split - complex case is closely related to the well - known real ginibre ensemble @xcite , which in itself is @xmath0-symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the formulation in terms of split - complex hermitian matrices might offer a new approach towards solving some outstanding problems regarding the spectral features of ginibre matrices . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> the split - quaternionic hermitian ensemble is not directly related to any previously studied ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with a brief summary of some important properties of split - complex and split - quaternionic numbers and matrices that we will need in the following . </S>",
    "<S> split - complex numbers @xcite are numbers of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the imaginary unit of the algebra , such that @xmath7 the conjugate of a split - complex number is given by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the `` norm '' of a split complex number , defined by @xmath9 can be positive , null , or negative . </S>",
    "<S> a split - complex number can be represented as a real @xmath3 matrix @xmath10 similarly , a generic split - quaternion @xcite @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 satisfy the relations @xmath15 the conjugate of a split - quaternion is defined as @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the `` norm '' of a split - quaternion is defined similar to the split - complex case by @xmath17 and again can be positive , null , or negative . </S>",
    "<S> a split - quaternion can be represented as a complex @xmath3 matrix @xmath18    in analogy to the case of quaternionic vector spaces @xcite we can define an ( indefinite ) inner product for two vectors @xmath19 with split - quaternionic components as @xmath20 the adjoint @xmath21 of a split - quaternionic matrix @xmath22 is then defined as @xmath23 , which in terms of the elements means taking the transpose and split - quaternionic conjugate , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we can generalise the concept of hermiticity to split - quaternionic matrices , by referring to matrices with split - quaternionic elements that satisfy @xmath25 as _ split - hermitian_. the set of split - hermitian matrices is invariant under standard unitary transformations . </S>",
    "<S> the subset of split - complex hermitian matrices is invariant under orthogonal transformations only . </S>",
    "<S> the space of @xmath26 split - hermitian matrices is @xmath27-dimensional , and the subspace of split - complex hermitian matrices is @xmath28-dimensional .    </S>",
    "<S> we can define eigenvalues and eigenvectors of split - hermitian matrices using the complex @xmath3 matrix representation in ( [ split_quat_matrix_rep ] ) for the elements . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting characteristic polynomial is real , thus the eigenvalues are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs . </S>",
    "<S> further , the eigenvalues of the @xmath29 representation are doubly degenerate , in analogy to kramer s degeneracy for quaternionic hermitian matrices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the split - quaternionic eigenvectors belonging to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal with respect to the inner product ( [ eqn_splitprod ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we define the class of @xmath0-symmetric matrices as the set of complex matrices with real characteristic polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any split - hermitian matrix can be interpreted as a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> a simple counting argument shows that the spaces of split - hermitian and complex @xmath0-symmetric matrices are in fact isomorphic . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath30 complex matrix has @xmath31 real parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are linearly independent linear functions of the parameters . that is , </S>",
    "<S> if we condition the matrix to have a real characteristic polynomial , we find one constraint for the parameters for the coefficient of each power in the polynomial , yielding @xmath32 linearly independent constraints . </S>",
    "<S> that is , a @xmath0-symmetric matrix can be parameterised by @xmath33 parameters , just as a split - hermitian matrix of the same size , thus they are isomorphic . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the subspace of split - complex hermitian matrices is isomorphic to the space of real @xmath0-symmetric matrices ( which is just the space of all real matrices ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now introduce random matrix ensembles of split - complex and split - quaternionic hermitian matrices , as direct generalisations of the standard gaussian unitary and gaussian symplectic ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we consider split - quaternionic and split - complex matrices whose elements are independently distributed normal random variables , subject to the constraint of split - hermiticity . </S>",
    "<S> we define the probability density function on the space of split - complex hermitian matrices @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 thus , this ensemble is invariant under orthogonal transformations of @xmath34 .    in the split - quaternionic case , </S>",
    "<S> we define the probability distribution on the space of matrices @xmath34 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and here @xmath39 performs the transpose of @xmath34 and complex conjugation with respect to the imaginary unit @xmath40 only . </S>",
    "<S> hence this ensemble is invariant under unitary transformations of @xmath34 , reflecting the invariance class of split - quaternionic hermitian matrices . </S>",
    "<S> note that the matrix elements of @xmath34 are by definition statistically independent for both ensembles ( [ eqn_p(h)_compl ] ) and ( [ eqn_p(h)_quat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , these new ensembles fulfil the two defining properties of the standard gaussian ensembles , of independence of the matrix elements and invariance under the invariance transformations of the class of matrices on which the ensemble is defined . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the two split - hermitian ensembles constitute universality classes for @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall now derive analytic expressions for the joint probability density of the eigenvalues and the one - level densities for the case of @xmath41 , following a method similar to the one used in @xcite for the real ginibre ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the split - complex case . </S>",
    "<S> writing @xmath42 with @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 the eigenvalues of h are given by @xmath45 clearly these eigenvalues can be real or complex conjugate , depending on the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    to deduce the joint probability density of the eigenvalues </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 we have to transform from @xmath49 and @xmath46 to @xmath50 and @xmath46 , and then integrate over @xmath47 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath51 and thus we find @xmath52 when integrating over @xmath46 and @xmath47 we have to consider that @xmath53 are real by definition . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we integrate over the regions @xmath54 , and @xmath55 to find @xmath56    from the joint probability distribution we can deduce the one - level density of the eigenvalues . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we have to distinguish between the case of real or complex conjugate eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath57 are real then @xmath58 integrating over one of the real eigenvalues then yields the one - level density for real eigenvalues @xmath59 we see that there is a non - zero probability to obtain two real eigenvalues , which is given by the normalisation of @xmath60 , as @xmath61 . + if @xmath57 are complex conjugate one of the eigenvalues entirely determines the other , and the joint probability density automatically reduces to the one - level density for complex eigenvalues @xmath62 the factor of two accountes for the fact that the eigenvalues are indistinguishable . the total one - level density of a complex eigenvalue is then given by @xmath63     split - complex hermitian ensemble ( [ eqn_p(h)_compl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the top left panel shows the histogram of the eigenvalues using numerically obtained eigenvalues from @xmath64 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the right panels show the histogram of the conditionally complex eigenvalues ( top ) in comparison to the analytical result ( bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom left panel shows the numerical and analytical distribution for conditionally real eigenvalues.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    [ splitcompdists ]    figure [ splitcompdists ] depicts the numerically obtained histogram of the eigenvalues of a large number of split - complex hermitian matrices sampled from the distribution ( [ eqn_p(h)_compl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot the probabilities conditional on real and complex eigenvalues respectively in comparison with the analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a good agreement between the numerics and the analytical results ; in particular , there is a sharp peak in the histogram for @xmath65 reflecting the @xmath46-function in the analytic distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the distributions ( [ gsuereal ] ) and ( [ gsuecompl ] ) are similar to those obtained from the @xmath3 real ginibre ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the two ensembles can be explicitly related . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath66 split - complex hermitian ensemble can be brought , via a parameter - independent orthogonal transformation on the @xmath67 matrix representation , to a matrix which is spectrally equivalent to two copies of a matrix from the @xmath66 real ginibre ensemble , with elements distributed as @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly we find that @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> that is @xmath76 are independently and identically distributed as @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar relation holds in the @xmath26 case .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the split - quaternionic case . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath78 with @xmath79 ; that is , we have the probability distribution @xmath80 transforming to the variables @xmath48 , @xmath46 , @xmath81 , and @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 we now proceed to integrate over the regions where the original parameters remain real . to ensure that @xmath84 we need @xmath85 rearranging this inequality as a limit on @xmath81 and integrating over @xmath81 , followed by integrating over @xmath46 over the region @xmath86 , leaves @xmath87 where @xmath88 to ensure that @xmath89 , we additionally require @xmath90 now , transforming our variables @xmath91 into polar coordinates @xmath92 and integrating over @xmath93 $ ] leaves the joint probability density function of @xmath57 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 the region @xmath96 is different for real eigenvalues in comparison to complex conjugate eigenvalues .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of real eigenvalues , the reality of @xmath46 implies that we integrate over @xmath97.$ ] we thus find the joint probability distribution for real eigenvalues as @xmath98 integrating over one of the eigenvalues we find the one - level density in the case of real eigenvalues as @xmath99 in the split - quaternionic case , the probability of obtaining real eigenvalues is @xmath100 , slightly smaller than in the split - complex case .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath101 and @xmath102 are complex conjugate , however , the reality of @xmath46 means that @xmath103 that is , we now have to integrate over @xmath104 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for the fact that the eigenvalues are indistinguishable , we thus obtain the one - level density for complex eigenvalues @xmath105 again we can express the total one - level density of a complex eigenvalue in the form ( [ totaldens ] ) .     for the split - quaternionic case.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    [ fig_eig_hist_quat ]    figure [ fig_eig_hist_quat ] depicts numerically obtained eigenvalue densities for a large number of matrices sampled from the distribution ( [ eqn_p(h)_quat ] ) in comparison with the analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a dip in the one - level density for real eigenvalues , similar to the one in the @xmath106 one level density for @xmath1 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the exact form of the distribution ( [ gssereal ] ) however , is distinctively different from the gue case .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally derive the level spacing distributions in the case of real eigenvalues for the split - hermitian ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> these are the distributions of the spacings @xmath107 , subject to the requirement that the mean level spacing is one . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we subsitute @xmath108 , in the joint probabilities of the real eigenvalues . for the split - complex case </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath109 integrating @xmath110 over the whole real line , normalising and rescaling to ensure that the mean spacing is one , we obtain @xmath111 this is identical to the level spacing for the goe , as has been noted before for the real ginibre ensemble @xcite .    for the split - quaternionic hermitian ensemble we again substitute @xmath112 and @xmath110 in the joint probability distribution for real eigenvalues to obtain @xmath113 after integrating over @xmath110 and appropriate rescaling we obtain @xmath114 where @xmath115        [ gsselevelreal ]    figure ( [ gsselevelreal ] ) depicts the numerically obtained histogram of the level spacings of the eigenvalues of a large number of split - complex hermitian and split - quaternionic hermitian matrices sampled from distributions ( [ eqn_p(h)_compl ] ) and ( [ eqn_p(h)_quat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an excellent agreement with the analytical reasults . </S>",
