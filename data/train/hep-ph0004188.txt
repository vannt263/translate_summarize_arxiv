    "cosmology ( from the greek : _ kosmos _ , universe , world , order , and _ logos _ , word , theory ) is probably the most ancient body of knowledge , dating from as far back as the predictions of seasons by early civilizations . yet , until recently , we could only answer to some of its more basic questions with an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "this poor state of affairs has dramatically changed in the last few years , thanks to ( what else ? ) raw data , coming from precise measurements of a wide range of cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , we are entering a precision era in cosmology , and soon most of our observables will be measured with a few percent accuracy .",
    "we are truly living in the golden age of cosmology .",
    "it is a very exciting time and i will try to communicate this enthusiasm to you .",
    "important results are coming out almost every month from a large set of experiments , which provide crucial information about the universe origin and evolution ; so rapidly that these notes will probably be outdated before they are in print as a cern report .",
    "in fact , some of the results i mentioned during the summer school have already been improved , specially in the area of the microwave background anisotropies .",
    "nevertheless , most of the new data can be interpreted within a coherent framework known as the standard cosmological model , based on the big bang theory of the universe and the inflationary paradigm , which is with us for two decades .",
    "i will try to make such a theoretical model accesible to young experimental particle physicists with little or no previous knowledge about general relativity and curved space - time , but with some knowledge of quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics .",
    "our present understanding of the universe is based upon the successful hot big bang theory , which explains its evolution from the first fraction of a second to our present age , around 13 billion years later .",
    "this theory rests upon four strong pillars , a theoretical framework based on general relativity , as put forward by albert einstein  @xcite and alexander a. friedmann  @xcite in the 1920s , and three robust observational facts : first , the expansion of the universe , discovered by edwin p.",
    "hubble  @xcite in the 1930s , as a recession of galaxies at a speed proportional to their distance from us .",
    "second , the relative abundance of light elements , explained by george gamow  @xcite in the 1940s , mainly that of helium , deuterium and lithium , which were cooked from the nuclear reactions that took place at around a second to a few minutes after the big bang , when the universe was a few times hotter than the core of the sun . third , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the afterglow of the big bang , discovered in 1965 by arno a. penzias and robert w. wilson  @xcite as a very isotropic blackbody radiation at a temperature of about 3 degrees kelvin , emitted when the universe was cold enough to form neutral atoms , and photons decoupled from matter , approximately 500,000 years after the big bang . today",
    ", these observations are confirmed to within a few percent accuracy , and have helped establish the hot big bang as the preferred model of the universe .      where are we in the universe ? during our lectures , of course , we were in asta papiernika , in `` the heart of europe '' , on planet earth , rotating ( 8 light - minutes away ) around the sun , an ordinary star 8.5 kpc cm . ] from the center of our galaxy , the milky way , which is part of the local group , within the virgo cluster of galaxies ( of size a few mpc ) , itself part of a supercluster ( of size @xmath0 mpc ) , within the visible universe ( @xmath1 mpc ) , most probably a tiny homogeneous patch of the infinite global structure of space - time , much beyond our observable universe .",
    "cosmology studies the universe as we see it .",
    "due to our inherent inability to experiment with it , its origin and evolution has always been prone to wild speculation .",
    "however , cosmology was born as a science with the advent of general relativity and the realization that the geometry of space - time , and thus the general attraction of matter , is determined by the energy content of the universe  @xcite , @xmath2 these non - linear equations are simply too difficult to solve without some insight coming from the symmetries of the problem at hand : the universe itself . at the time",
    "( 1917 - 1922 ) the known ( observed ) universe extended a few hundreds of parsecs away , to the galaxies in the local group , andromeda and the large and small magellanic clouds : the universe looked extremely anisotropic .",
    "nevertheless , both einstein and friedmann speculated that the most `` reasonable '' symmetry for the universe at large should be _ homogeneity _ at all points , and thus _ isotropy_. it was not until the detection , a few decades later , of the microwave background by penzias and wilson that this important assumption was finally put onto firm experimental ground .",
    "so , what is the most general metric satisfying homogeneity and isotropy at large scales ?",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , written here in terms of the invariant geodesic distance @xmath3 in four dimensions , @xmath4 , see ref .",
    "@xcite , everywhere , unless specified . ] @xmath5\\,,\\ ] ] characterized by just two quantities , a _ scale factor _ @xmath6 , which determines the physical size of the universe , and a constant @xmath7 , which characterizes the _ spatial _ curvature of the universe , @xmath8 spatially open , flat and closed universes have different geometries .",
    "light geodesics on these universes behave differently , and thus could in principle be distinguished observationally , as we shall discuss later . apart from the three - dimensional spatial curvature",
    ", we can also compute a four - dimensional _ space - time _ curvature , @xmath9 depending on the dynamics ( and thus on the matter / energy content ) of the universe , we will have different possible outcomes of its evolution .",
    "the universe may expand for ever , recollapse in the future or approach an asymptotic state in between .      in 1929 ,",
    "edwin p. hubble observed a redshift in the spectra of distant galaxies , which indicated that they were receding from us at a velocity proportional to their distance to us  @xcite .",
    "this was correctly interpreted as mainly due to the expansion of the universe , that is , to the fact that the scale factor today is larger than when the photons were emitted by the observed galaxies . for simplicity , consider the metric of a spatially flat universe , @xmath10 ( the generalization of the following argument to curved space is straightforward ) .",
    "the scale factor @xmath6 gives _ physical size _ to the spatial coordinates @xmath11 , and the expansion is nothing but a change of scale ( of spatial units ) with time .",
    "except for _ peculiar velocities _ , i.e. motion due to the local attraction of matter , galaxies do not move in coordinate space , it is the space - time fabric which is stretching between galaxies . due to this continuous stretching ,",
    "the observed wavelength of photons coming from distant objects is greater than when they were emitted by a factor precisely equal to the ratio of scale factors , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the present value of the scale factor .",
    "since the universe today is larger than in the past , the observed wavelengths will be shifted towards the red , or _ redshifted _",
    ", by an amount characterized by @xmath14 , the redshift parameter .    in the context of a frw metric",
    ", the universe expansion is characterized by a quantity known as the hubble rate of expansion , @xmath15 , whose value today is denoted by @xmath16 . as i shall deduce later , it is possible to compute the relation between the physical distance @xmath17 and the present rate of expansion , in terms of the redshift parameter , refers to luminosity , which characterizes the amount of light emitted by an object .",
    "( [ luminositydistance ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath18 at small distances from us , i.e. at @xmath19 , we can safely keep only the linear term , and thus the recession velocity becomes proportional to the distance from us , @xmath20 , the proportionality constant being the hubble rate , @xmath16 .",
    "this expression constitutes the so - called hubble law , and is spectacularly confirmed by a huge range of data , up to distances of hundreds of megaparsecs .",
    "in fact , only recently measurements from very bright and distant supernovae , at @xmath21 , were obtained , and are beginning to probe the second - order term , proportional to the deceleration parameter @xmath22 , see eq .",
    "( [ decelerationparameter ] ) .",
    "i will come back to these measurements in section  3 .",
    "one may be puzzled as to _ why _ do we see such a stretching of space - time . indeed ,",
    "if all spatial distances are scaled with a universal scale factor , our local measuring units ( our rulers ) should also be stretched , and therefore we should not see the difference when comparing the two distances ( e.g. the two wavelengths ) at different times .",
    "the reason we see the difference is because we live in a gravitationally bound system , decoupled from the expansion of the universe : local spatial units in these systems are _ not _ stretched by the expansion .",
    "the wavelengths of photons are stretched along their geodesic path from one galaxy to another . in this consistent world picture , galaxies are like point particles , moving as a fluid in an expanding universe .",
    "so far i have only discussed the geometrical aspects of space - time .",
    "let us now consider the matter and energy content of such a universe .",
    "the most general matter fluid consistent with the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is a perfect fluid , one in which an observer _ comoving with the fluid _ would see the universe around it as isotropic . the energy momentum tensor associated with such a fluid can be written as  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pressure and energy density of the fluid at a given time in the expansion , and @xmath26 is the comoving four - velocity , satisfying @xmath27 .",
    "let us now write the equations of motion of such a fluid in an expanding universe . according to general relativity",
    ", these equations can be deduced from the einstein equations ( [ einsteinequations ] ) , where we substitute the frw metric ( [ frwmetric ] ) and the perfect fluid tensor ( [ perfectfluid ] ) . the @xmath28 component of the einstein equations constitutes the so - called friedmann equation @xmath29 where i have treated the cosmological constant @xmath30 as a different component from matter .",
    "in fact , it can be associated with the vacuum energy of quantum field theory , although we still do not understand why should it have such a small value ( 120 orders of magnitude below that predicted by quantum theory ) , if it is non - zero .",
    "this constitutes today one of the most fundamental problems of physics , let alone cosmology .",
    "the conservation of energy ( @xmath31 ) , a direct consequence of the general covariance of the theory ( @xmath32 ) , can be written in terms of the frw metric and the perfect fluid tensor ( [ perfectfluid ] ) as @xmath33 where the energy density and pressure can be split into its matter and radiation components , @xmath34 , with corresponding equations of state , @xmath35 .",
    "together , the friedmann and the energy - conservation equation give the evolution equation for the scale factor , @xmath36    i will now make a few useful definitions .",
    "we can write the hubble parameter today @xmath16 in units of 100 kms@xmath37mpc@xmath37 , in terms of which one can estimate the order of magnitude for the present size and age of the universe , @xmath38 the parameter @xmath39 has been measured to be in the range @xmath40 for decades , and only in the last few years has it been found to lie within 10% of @xmath41 .",
    "i will discuss those recent measurements in the next section .",
    "one can also define a _ critical _",
    "density @xmath42 , that which in the absence of a cosmological constant would correspond to a flat universe , @xmath43 where @xmath44 g  is a solar mass unit .",
    "the critical density @xmath42 corresponds to approximately 4 protons per cubic meter , certainly a very dilute fluid ! in terms of the critical density it is possible to define the ratios @xmath45 , for matter , radiation , cosmological constant and even curvature , today , @xmath46    we can evaluate today the radiation component @xmath47 , corresponding to relativistic particles , from the density of microwave background photons , @xmath48 , which gives @xmath49 .",
    "three massless neutrinos contribute an even smaller amount .",
    "therefore , we can safely neglect the contribution of relativistic particles to the total density of the universe today , which is dominated either by non - relativistic particles ( baryons , dark matter or massive neutrinos ) or by a cosmological constant , and write the rate of expansion @xmath50 in terms of its value today , @xmath51 an interesting consequence of these redefinitions is that i can now write the friedmann equation today , @xmath52 , as a _ cosmic sum rule _",
    ", @xmath53 where we have neglected @xmath47 today .",
    "that is , in the context of a frw universe , the total fraction of matter density , cosmological constant and spatial curvature today must add up to one .",
    "for instance , if we measure one of the three components , say the spatial curvature , we can deduce the sum of the other two .",
    "making use of the cosmic sum rule today , we can write the matter and cosmological constant as a function of the scale factor ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 & & \\,\\omega_\\lambda(a)={\\lambda\\over3h^2(a)}={\\omega_\\lambda a^3\\over a + \\omega_{\\rm m}(1-a ) + \\omega_\\lambda(a^3-a)}\\hspace{5mm}\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{lr}\\stackrel{a\\rightarrow0}{\\longrightarrow}&0\\\\ \\label{omegal } \\stackrel{a\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\longrightarrow}&1\\end{array}\\right.\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that for sufficiently early times , @xmath56 , all matter - dominated frw universes can be described by einstein - de sitter ( eds ) models ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the radiation component starts dominating , see eq .",
    "( [ h2a ] ) , but we still recover the eds model . ] on the other hand , the vacuum energy will always dominate in the future .",
    "another relationship which becomes very useful is that of the cosmological deceleration parameter today , @xmath22 , in terms of the matter and cosmological constant components of the universe , see eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) , @xmath58 which is independent of the spatial curvature .",
    "uniform expansion corresponds to @xmath59 and requires a precise cancellation : @xmath60 .",
    "it represents spatial sections that are expanding at a fixed rate , its scale factor growing by the same amount in equally - spaced time intervals .",
    "accelerated expansion corresponds to @xmath61 and comes about whenever @xmath62 : spatial sections expand at an increasing rate , their scale factor growing at a greater speed with each time interval",
    ". decelerated expansion corresponds to @xmath63 and occurs whenever @xmath64 : spatial sections expand at a decreasing rate , their scale factor growing at a smaller speed with each time interval .",
    "it is enlightening to work with a mechanical analogy of the friedmann equation .",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ friedmannequation ] ) as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the equivalent of mass for the whole volume of the universe .",
    "equation ( [ mechanicalanalog ] ) can be understood as the energy conservation law @xmath67 for a test particle of unit mass in the central potential @xmath68 corresponding to a newtonian potential plus a harmonic oscillator potential with a _ negative _ spring constant @xmath69 .",
    "note that , in the absence of a cosmological constant ( @xmath70 ) , a critical universe , defined as the borderline between indefinite expansion and recollapse , corresponds , through the friedmann equations of motion , precisely with a flat universe ( @xmath71 ) . in that case , and _ only _ in that case , a spatially open universe ( @xmath72 ) corresponds to an eternally expanding universe , and a spatially closed universe ( @xmath73 ) to a recollapsing universe in the future .",

    "weak interactions were too slow to keep neutrinos in thermal equilibrium with the plasma , so they decoupled .",

    "although the isotropic microwave background indicates that the universe in the _ past _ was extraordinarily homogeneous , we know that the universe _ today _ is not exactly homogeneous : we observe galaxies , clusters and superclusters on large scales . these structures are expected to arise from very small primordial inhomogeneities that grow in time via gravitational instability , and that may have originated from tiny ripples in the metric , as matter fell into their troughs .",
    "those ripples must have left some trace as temperature anisotropies in the microwave background , and indeed such anisotropies were finally discovered by the cobe satellite in 1992 .",
    "the reason why they took so long to be discovered was that they appear as perturbations in temperature of only one part in @xmath207 .",
    "while the predicted anisotropies have finally been seen in the cmb , not all kinds of matter and/or evolution of the universe can give rise to the structure we observe today .",
    "if we define the density contrast as  @xcite @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the average cosmic density , we need a theory that will grow a density contrast with amplitude @xmath214 at the last scattering surface ( @xmath215 ) up to density contrasts of the order of @xmath216 for galaxies at redshifts @xmath19 , i.e. today .",
    "this is a _ necessary _ requirement for any consistent theory of structure formation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropies observed by the cobe satellite correspond to a small - amplitude scale - invariant primordial power spectrum of inhomogeneities @xmath217 where the brackets @xmath218 represent integration over an ensemble of different universe realizations .",
    "these inhomogeneities are like waves in the space - time metric .",
    "when matter fell in the troughs of those waves , it created density perturbations that collapsed gravitationally to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies , with a spectrum that is also scale invariant .",

    "that is , cosmic structure formed from the bottom up : from galaxies to clusters to superclusters , and not the other way around .",
    "this fundamental difference is an indication of the type of matter that gave rise to structure .",
    "the observed power spectrum of the galaxy matter distribution from a selection of deep redshift catalogs can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .    we know from big bang nucleosynthesis that all the baryons in the universe can not account for the observed amount of matter ,",
    "so there must be some extra matter ( dark since we do nt see it ) to account for its gravitational pull .",
    "whether it is relativistic ( hot ) or non - relativistic ( cold ) could be inferred from observations : relativistic particles tend to diffuse from one concentration of matter to another , thus transferring energy among them and preventing the growth of structure on small scales .",
    "this is excluded by observations , so we conclude that most of the matter responsible for structure formation must be cold .",
    "how much there is is a matter of debate at the moment .",
    "some recent analyses suggest that there is not enough cold dark matter to reach the critical density required to make the universe flat .",
    "if we want to make sense of the present observations , we must conclude that some other form of energy permeates the universe . in order to resolve this issue ,",
    "even deeper galaxy redshift catalogs are underway , looking at millions of galaxies , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the anglo - australian two degree field ( 2df ) galaxy redshift survey , which are at this moment taking data , up to redshifts of @xmath222 , over a large region of the sky .",
    "these important observations will help astronomers determine the nature of the dark matter and test the validity of the models of structure formation .        before cobe discovered the anisotropies of the microwave background",
    "there were serious doubts whether gravity alone could be responsible for the formation of the structure we observe in the universe today .",
    "it seemed that a new force was required to do the job .",
    "fortunately , the anisotropies were found with the right amplitude for structure to be accounted for by gravitational collapse of primordial inhomogeneities under the attraction of a large component of non - relativistic dark matter .",
    "nowadays , the standard theory of structure formation is a cold dark matter model with a non vanishing cosmological constant in a spatially flat universe .",
    "gravitational collapse amplifies the density contrast initially through linear growth and later on via non - linear collapse . in the process ,",
    "overdense regions decouple from the hubble expansion to become bound systems , which start attracting eachother to form larger bound structures .",
    "in fact , the largest structures , superclusters , have not yet gone non - linear .    the primordial spectrum ( [ harrisonzeldovich ] ) is reprocessed by gravitational instability after the universe becomes matter dominated and inhomogeneities can grow .",
    "linear perturbation theory shows that the growing mode  , for all @xmath223 .",
    "] of small density contrasts go like  @xcite @xmath224 in the einstein - de sitter limit ( @xmath225 and 0 , for radiation and matter , respectively ) .",
    "there are slight deviations for @xmath226 , if @xmath227 or @xmath74 , but we will not be concerned with them here .",
    "the important observation is that , since the density contrast at last scattering is of order @xmath228 , and the scale factor has grown since then only a factor @xmath229 , one would expect a density contrast today of order @xmath230 . instead , we observe structures like galaxies , where @xmath231 .",
    "so how can this be possible ?",
    "the microwave background shows anisotropies due to fluctuations in the baryonic matter component only ( to which photons couple , electromagnetically ) . if there is an additional matter component that only couples through very weak interactions , fluctuations in that component could grow as soon as it decoupled from the plasma , well before photons decoupled from baryons .",
    "the reason why baryonic inhomogeneities can not grow is because of photon pressure : as baryons collapse towards denser regions , radiation pressure eventually halts the contraction and sets up acoustic oscillations in the plasma that prevent the growth of perturbations , until photon decoupling . on the other hand , a weakly interacting cold dark matter component could start gravitational collapse much earlier , even before matter - radiation equality , and thus reach the density contrast amplitudes observed today .",
    "the resolution of this mismatch is one of the strongest arguments for the existence of a weakly interacting cold dark matter component of the universe .",
    "how much dark matter there is in the universe can be deduced from the actual power spectrum ( the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function of density perturbations ) of the observed large scale structure .",
    "one can decompose the density contrast in fourier components , see eq .",
    "( [ densitycontrast ] ) .",
    "this is very convenient since in linear perturbation theory individual fourier components evolve independently .",
    "a comoving wavenumber @xmath232 is said to `` enter the horizon '' when @xmath233 .",
    "if a certain perturbation , of wavelength @xmath234 , enters the horizon before matter - radiation equality , the fast radiation - driven expansion prevents dark - matter perturbations from collapsing .",
    "since light can only cross regions that are smaller than the horizon , the suppression of growth due to radiation is restricted to scales smaller than the horizon , while large - scale perturbations remain unaffected .",
    "this is the reason why the horizon size at equality , eq .",
    "( [ horizonsizeequality ] ) , sets an important scale for structure growth , @xmath235 the suppression factor can be easily computed from ( [ lineargrowth ] ) as @xmath236 . in other words ,",
    "the processed power spectrum @xmath237 will have the form : @xmath238 k^{-3}\\,,&\\hspace{1cm}k\\gg k_{\\rm eq}\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] this is precisely the shape that large - scale galaxy catalogs are bound to test in the near future , see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . furthermore , since relativistic hot dark matter ( hdm ) transfer energy between clumps of matter , they will wipe out small scale perturbations , and this should be seen as a distinctive signature in the matter power spectra of future galaxy catalogs . on the other hand ,",
    "non - relativistic cold dark matter ( cdm ) allow structure to form on _ all _ scales via gravitational collapse .",
    "the dark matter will then pull in the baryons , which will later shine and thus allow us to see the galaxies .",
    "naturally , when baryons start to collapse onto dark matter potential wells , they will convert a large fraction of their potential energy into kinetic energy of protons and electrons , ionizing the medium . as a consequence",
    ", we expect to see a large fraction of those baryons constituting a hot ionized gas surrounding large clusters of galaxies .",
    "this is indeed what is observed , and confirms the general picture of structure formation .",
    "in this section , i will restrict myself to those recent measurements of the cosmological parameters by means of standard cosmological techniques , together with a few instances of new results from recently applied techniques .",
    "we will see that a large host of observations are determining the cosmological parameters with some reliability of the order of 10% . however , the majority of these measurements are dominated by large systematic errors .",
    "most of the recent work in observational cosmology has been the search for virtually systematic - free observables , like those obtained from the microwave background anisotropies , and discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "i will devote , however , this section to the more ` classical ' measurements of the following cosmological parameters : the rate of expansion @xmath16 ; the matter content @xmath77 ; the cosmological constant @xmath78 ; the spatial curvature @xmath239 , and the age of the universe @xmath240 . ) . ]",
    "these five basic cosmological parameters are not mutually independent . using the homogeneity and isotropy on large scales observed by cobe",

    "i will review here the first three , and leave the last method for section  4.4 , since it involves knowledge about the primordial spectrum of inhomogeneities .",
    "imagine a quasi - stellar object ( qso ) at large redshift ( @xmath275 ) whose light is lensed by an intervening galaxy at redshift @xmath276 and arrives to an observer at @xmath269 .",
    "there will be at least two different images of the same background _",
    "variable _ point source .",
    "the arrival times of photons from two different gravitationally lensed images of the quasar depend on the different path lengths and the gravitational potential traversed .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the time delay and the angular separation of the different images of a variable quasar can be used to determine @xmath16 with great accuracy .",
    "this method , proposed in 1964 by refsdael  @xcite , offers tremendous potential because it can be applied at great distances and it is based on very solid physical principles  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are very few systems with both a favourable geometry ( i.e. a known mass distribution of the intervening galaxy ) and a variable background source with a measurable time delay .",
    "that is the reason why it has taken so much time since the original proposal for the first results to come out .",
    "fortunately , there are now very powerful telescopes that can be used for these purposes .",
    "the best candidate to - date is the qso  @xmath277 , observed with the 10 m keck telescope , for which there is a model of the lensing mass distribution that is consistent with the measured velocity dispersion . assuming a flat space with @xmath278",
    ", one can determine  @xcite @xmath279 the main source of systematic error is the degeneracy between the mass distribution of the lens and the value of @xmath16 .",
    "knowledge of the velocity dispersion within the lens as a function of position helps constrain the mass distribution , but those measurements are very difficult and , in the case of lensing by a cluster of galaxies , the dark matter distribution in those systems is usually unknown , associated with a complicated cluster potential .",
    "nevertheless , the method is just starting to give promising results and , in the near future , with the recent discovery of several systems with optimum properties , the prospects for measuring @xmath16 and lowering its uncertainty with this technique are excellent .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the gravitational collapse of baryons onto the potential wells generated by dark matter gave rise to the reionization of the plasma , generating an x - ray halo around rich clusters of galaxies , see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . the inverse - compton scattering of microwave background photons off the hot electrons in the x - ray gas results in a measurable distortion of the blackbody spectrum of the microwave background , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "since photons acquire extra energy from the x - ray electrons , we expect a shift towards higher frequencies of the spectrum , @xmath280 .",
    "this corresponds to a _",
    "decrement _ of the microwave background temperature at low frequencies ( rayleigh - jeans region ) and an increment at high frequencies , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "measuring the _ spatial _ distribution of the sz effect ( 3 k spectrum ) , together with a high resolution x - ray map ( @xmath281 k spectrum ) of the cluster , one can determine the density and temperature distribution of the hot gas . since the x - ray flux is distance - dependent ( @xmath282 ) , while the sz decrement is not ( because the energy of the cmb photons increases as we go back in redshift , @xmath283 , and exactly compensates the redshift in energy of the photons that reach us ) , one can determine from there the distance to the cluster , and thus the hubble rate @xmath16 .",
    "the advantages of this method are that it can be applied to large distances and it is based on clear physical principles .",
    "the main systematics come from possible clumpiness of the gas ( which would reduce @xmath16 ) , projection effects ( if the clusters are prolate , @xmath16 could be larger ) , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium of the x - ray gas , details of models for the gas and electron densities , and possible contaminations from point sources .",
    "present measurements give the value  @xcite @xmath284 compatible with other determinations . a great advantage of this completely new and independent method",
    "is that nowadays more and more clusters are observed in the x - ray , and soon we will have high - resolution 2d maps of the sz decrement from several balloon flights , as well as from future microwave background satellites , together with precise x - ray maps and spectra from the chandra x - ray observatory recently launched by nasa , as well as from the european x - ray satellite xmm launched a few months ago by esa , which will deliver orders of magnitude better resolution than the existing einstein x - ray satellite .",
    "cepheids are low - mass variable stars with a period - luminosity relation based on the helium ionization cycles inside the star , as it contracts and expands .",
    "this time variability can be measured , and the star s absolute luminosity determined from the calibrated relationship . from the observed flux one can then deduce the luminosity distance ,",
    "( [ luminositydistance ] ) , and thus the hubble rate @xmath16 . the hubble space telescope ( hst )",
    "was launched by nasa in 1990 ( and repaired in 1993 ) with the specific project of calibrating the extragalactic distance scale and thus determining the hubble rate with 10% accuracy .",
    "the most recent results from hst are the following  @xcite @xmath285 the main source of systematic error is the distance to the large magellanic cloud , which provides the fiducial comparison for cepheids in more distant galaxies .",
    "other systematic uncertainties that affect the value of @xmath16 are the internal extinction correction method used , a possible metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity relation and cluster population incompleteness bias , for a set of 21 galaxies within 25 mpc , and 23 clusters within @xmath286 .    with better telescopes coming up soon , like the very large telescope ( vlt ) interferometer of the european southern observatory ( eso ) in the chilean atacama desert , with 4 synchronized telescopes by the year 2005 , and the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) proposed by nasa for 2008",

    "realized that the so called nebulae were actually distant galaxies very similar to our own .",
    "soon afterwards , in 1933 , zwicky found dynamical evidence that there is possibly ten to a hundred times more mass in the coma cluster than contributed by the luminous matter in galaxies  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not until the 1970s that the existence of dark matter began to be taken more seriously . at that time",
    "there was evidence that rotation curves of galaxies did not fall off with radius and that the dynamical mass was increasing with scale from that of individual galaxies up to clusters of galaxies .",
    "since then , new possible extra sources to the matter content of the universe have been accumulating : @xmath287    the empirical route to the determination of @xmath77 is nowadays one of the most diversified of all cosmological parameters .",
    "the matter content of the universe can be deduced from the mass - to - light ratio of various objects in the universe ; from the rotation curves of galaxies ; from microlensing and the direct search of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) ; from the cluster velocity dispersion with the use of the virial theorem ; from the baryon fraction in the x - ray gas of clusters ; from weak gravitational lensing ; from the observed matter distribution of the universe via its power spectrum ; from the cluster abundance and its evolution ; from direct detection of massive neutrinos at superkamiokande ; from direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) at dama and ukdmc , and finally from microwave background anisotropies .",
    "i will review here just a few of them .",
    "the most straight forward method of estimating @xmath77 is to measure the luminosity of stars in galaxies and then estimate the mass - to - light ratio , defined as the mass per luminosity density observed from an object , @xmath288 .",
    "this ratio is usually expressed in solar units , @xmath289 , so that for the sun @xmath290 .",

    ", account for @xmath298 , and thus  @xcite @xmath299 as a consequence , the luminous matter alone is far from the critical density .",
    "moreover , comparing with the amount of baryons from big bang nucleosynthesis ( [ omegabaryon ] ) , we conclude that @xmath300 , so there must be a large fraction of baryons that are dark , perhaps in the form of very dim stars .",
    "the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies provide the most direct evidence for the existence of large amounts of dark matter .",
    "spiral galaxies consist of a central bulge and a very thin disk , stabilized against gravitational collapse by angular momentum conservation , and surrounded by an approximately spherical halo of dark matter .",
    "one can measure the orbital velocities of objects orbiting around the disk as a function of radius from the doppler shifts of their spectral lines .",
    "the rotation curve of the andromeda galaxy was first measured by babcock in 1938 , from the stars in the disk .",
    "later it became possible to measure galactic rotation curves far out into the disk , and a trend was found  @xcite .",
    "the orbital velocity rose linearly from the center outward until it reached a typical value of 200 km / s , and then remained flat out to the largest measured radii .",
    "this was completely unexpected since the observed surface luminosity of the disk falls off exponentially with radius , @xmath301 , see ref .",
    "therefore , one would expect that most of the galactic mass is concentrated within a few disk lengths @xmath302 , such that the rotation velocity is determined as in a keplerian orbit , @xmath303 .",
    "no such behaviour is observed .",
    "in fact , the most convincing observations come from radio emission ( from the 21 cm line ) of neutral hydrogen in the disk , which has been measured to much larger galactic radii than optical tracers .",
    "a typical case is that of the spiral galaxy ngc 6503 , where @xmath304 kpc , while the furthest measured hydrogen line is at @xmath305 kpc , about 13 disk lengths away .",
    "the measured rotation curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] together with the relative components associated with the disk , the halo and the gas .        nowadays",
    ", thousands of galactic rotation curves are known , and all suggest the existence of about ten times more mass in the halos of spiral galaxies than in the stars of the disk .",
    "recent numerical simulations of galaxy formation in a cdm cosmology  @xcite suggest that galaxies probably formed by the infall of material in an overdense region of the universe that had decoupled from the overall expansion .",
    "the dark matter is supposed to undergo violent relaxation and create a virialized system , i.e. in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this picture has led to a simple model of dark - matter halos as isothermal spheres , with density profile @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is a core radius and @xmath308 , with @xmath309 equal to the plateau value of the flat rotation curve .",
    "this model is consistent with the universal rotation curve seen in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . at large radii",
    "the dark matter distribution leads to a flat rotation curve . adding up all the matter in galactic halos up to maximum radii",
    ", one finds @xmath310 , and therefore @xmath311 of course , it would be extraordinary if we could confirm , through direct detection , the existence of dark matter in our own galaxy .",
    "for that purpose , one should measure its rotation curve , which is much more difficult because of obscuration by dust in the disk , as well as problems with the determination of reliable galactocentric distances for the tracers .",
    "nevertheless , the rotation curve of the milky way has been measured and conforms to the usual picture , with a plateau value of the rotation velocity of 220 km / s , see ref .",

    "we will come back to direct searched of dark matter in a later subsection .",
    "the existence of large amounts of dark matter in the universe , and in our own galaxy in particular , is now established beyond any reasonable doubt , but its nature remains a mystery .",
    "we have seen that baryons can not account for the whole matter content of the universe ; however , since the contribution of the halo ( [ omegahalo ] ) is comparable in magnitude to the baryon fraction of the universe ( [ omegabaryon ] ) , one may ask whether the galactic halo could be made of purely baryonic material in some non - luminous form , and if so , how one should search for it . in other words , are machos the non - luminous baryons filling the gap between @xmath314 and @xmath315 ? if not , what are they ?",
    "let us start a systematic search for possibilities .",
    "they can not be normal stars since they would be luminous ; neither hot gas since it would shine ; nor cold gas since it would absorb light and reemit in the infrared .",
    "could they be burnt - out stellar remnants ?",
    "this seems implausible since they would arise from a population of normal stars of which there is no trace in the halo .",
    "neutron stars or black holes would typically arise from supernova explosions and thus eject heavy elements into the galaxy , while the overproduction of helium in the halo is strongly constrained .",
    "they could be white dwarfs , i.e. stars not massive enough to reach supernova phase . despite some recent arguments ,",
    "a halo composed by white dwarfs is not rigorously excluded .",
    "are they stars too small to shine ?",
    "perhaps m - dwarfs , stars with a mass @xmath316 which are intrinsically dim ; however , very long exposure images of the hubble space telescope restrict the possible m - dwarf contribution to the galaxy to be below 6% .",
    "the most plausible alternative is a halo composed of brown dwarfs with mass @xmath317 , which never ignite hydrogen and thus shine only from the residual energy due to gravitational contraction .",
    "in fact , the extrapolation of the stellar mass function to small masses predicts a large number of brown dwarfs within normal stellar populations .",
    "a final possibility is primordial black holes ( pbh ) , which could have been created in the early universe from early phase transitions  @xcite , even before baryons were formed , and thus may be classified as non - baryonic .",

    "imagine an observer on earth watching a distant star in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , 50 kpc away .",
    "if the galactic halo is filled with machos , one of them will occasionally pass near the line of sight and thus cause the image of the background star to brighten .",
    "if the macho moves with velocity @xmath327 transverse to the line of sight , and if its _ impact parameter _ , i.e. the minimal distance to the line of sight , is @xmath318 , then one expects an apparent lightcurve as shown in fig .",

    "the typical duration of the light curve is the time it takes a macho to cross an einstein radius , @xmath329 .",

    "there are at present two types of experiments : neutrino oscillation experiments , which measure only _ differences _ in squared masses , and direct mass - searches experiments , like the tritium @xmath391-spectrum and the neutrinoless double-@xmath391 decay experiments , which measure directly the mass of the electron neutrino and give a bound @xmath392 2 ev . neutrinos with such a mass could very well constitute the hdm component of the universe , @xmath393 .",

    "+ - what is the global structure of the universe beyond our observable patch ?",

    "there is nothing in the theory that determines this parameter a priori .",
    "however , it is directly related , via the friedmann equation ( [ friedmannequation ] ) , to the dynamics , and thus the matter content , of the universe , @xmath452 we can therefore define a new variable , @xmath453 whose time evolution is given by @xmath454 where @xmath455 characterizes the _ number of @xmath456-folds _ of universe expansion ( @xmath457 ) and where we have used eq .",

    "a small perturbation from @xmath87 will drive the system towards @xmath463 .",

    "perhaps the universe indeed started with such a peculiar initial condition , but it is epistemologically more satisfying if we give a fundamental dynamical reason for the universe to have started so close to spatial flatness .",
    "these arguments were first used by robert dicke in the 1960s , much before inflation .",
    "he argued that the most natural initial condition for the spatial curvature should have been the planck scale curvature , @xmath470 , where the planck length is @xmath471 cm , that is , 60 orders of magnitude smaller than the present size of the universe , @xmath472 cm . a universe with this immense curvature would have collapsed within a planck time , @xmath473 s , again 60 orders of magnitude smaller than the present age of the universe , @xmath474 s. therefore , the flatness problem is also related to the age problem , why is it that the universe is so old and flat when , under ordinary circumstances ( based on the fundamental scale of gravity ) it should have lasted only a planck time and reached a size of order the planck length ? as we will see , inflation gives a dynamical reason to such a peculiar initial condition .",
    "an expanding universe has _",
    "particle horizons _ , that is , spatial regions beyond which causal communication can not occur .",
    "the horizon distance can be defined as the maximum distance that light could have travelled since the origin of the universe  @xcite , @xmath475 which is proportional to the hubble scale .",
    "for instance , at the beginning of nucleosynthesis the horizon distance is a few light - seconds , but grows _ linearly _ with time and by the end of nucleosynthesis it is a few light - minutes , i.e. a factor 100 larger , while the scale factor has increased _ only _ a factor of 10 .",
    "the fact that the causal horizon increases faster , @xmath476 , than the scale factor , @xmath477 , implies that at any given time the universe contains regions within itself that , according to the big bang theory , were _ never _ in causal contact before .",
    "for instance , the number of causally disconnected regions at a given redshift @xmath14 present in our causal volume today , @xmath478 , is @xmath479 which , for the time of decoupling , is of order @xmath480 .    .",
    "at the time of decoupling , the volume that gave rise to our present universe contained many causally disconnected regions ( top figure ) .",

    "this constitutes the so - called horizon problem , which is spectacularly solved by inflation . from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=377 ]    this phenomenon is particularly acute in the case of the observed microwave background .",
    "information can not travel faster than the speed of light , so the causal region at the time of photon decoupling could not be larger than @xmath482 light years across , or about @xmath483 projected in the sky today .",
    "so why should regions that are separated by more than @xmath483 in the sky today have exactly the same temperature , to within 10 ppm , when the photons that come from those two distant regions could not have been in causal contact when they were emitted ?",

    "in modern physics , elementary particles are represented by quantum fields , which resemble the familiar electric , magnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "a field is simply a function of space and time whose quantum oscillations are interpreted as particles . in our case ,",
    "the inflaton field has , associated with it , a large potential energy density , which drives the exponential expansion during inflation , see fig .",
    "[ fig32 ] . we know from general relativity that the density of matter determines the expansion of the universe , but a constant energy density acts in a very peculiar way : as a repulsive force that makes any two points in space separate at exponentially large speeds .",
    "( this does not violate the laws of causality because there is no information carried along in the expansion , it is simply the stretching of space - time . )        this superluminal expansion is capable of explaining the large scale homogeneity of our observable universe and , in particular , why the microwave background looks so isotropic : regions separated today by more than @xmath483 in the sky were , in fact , in causal contact before inflation , but were stretched to cosmological distances by the expansion .",
    "any inhomogeneities present before the tremendous expansion would be washed out .",
    "this explains why photons from supposedly causally disconneted regions have actually the same spectral distribution with the same temperature , see fig .",
    "[ fig31 ] .",
    "moreover , in the usual big bang scenario a flat universe , one in which the gravitational attraction of matter is exactly balanced by the cosmic expansion , is unstable under perturbations : a small deviation from flatness is amplified and soon produces either an empty universe or a collapsed one . as we discussed above , for the universe to be nearly flat today , it must have been extremely flat at nucleosynthesis , deviations not exceeding more than one part in @xmath484 .",
    "this extreme fine tuning of initial conditions was also solved by the inflationary paradigm , see fig .",
    "[ fig33 ] .",
    "thus inflation is an extremely elegant hypothesis that explains how a region much , much greater that our own observable universe could have become smooth and flat without recourse to _ ad hoc _ initial conditions .",

    "these relics are diluted by the superluminal expansion , which leaves at most one of these particles per causal horizon , making them harmless to the subsequent evolution of the universe .",
    "the only thing we know about this peculiar scalar field , the _ inflaton _ , is that it has a mass and a self - interaction potential @xmath485 but we ignore everything else , even the scale at which its dynamics determines the superluminal expansion . in particular , we still do not know the nature of the inflaton field itself , is it some new _ fundamental _ scalar field in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , or is it just some _ effective _ description of a more fundamental high energy interaction ?",
    "hopefully , in the near future , experiments in particle physics might give us a clue to its nature .",

    "suppose that , during inflation , the scalar field evolves very slowly down its effective potential , then we can define the slow - roll parameters  @xcite , @xmath512 it is easy to see that the condition @xmath513 characterizes inflation : it is all you need for superluminal expansion , i.e. for the horizon distance to grow more slowly than the scale factor , in order to solve the homogeneity problem , as well as for the spatial curvature to decay faster than usual , in order to solve the flatness problem .",

    "one of the most astonishing predictions of inflation , one that was not even expected , is that quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field are stretched by the exponential expansion and generate large - scale perturbations in the metric .",

    "we say that these parameters are _ degenerate _ with respect to the observations",
    ". however , often one finds combinations of various experiments / observations which break the degeneracy , for example by depending on a different combination of parameters .",
    "this is precisely the case with the cosmological parameters , as measured by a combination of large - scale structure observations , microwave background anisotropies , supernovae ia observations and hubble space telescope measurements , a feature named somewhat idiosyncratically as `` cosmic complementarity '' , see ref .",
    "it is expected that in the near future we will be able to determine the parameters of the standard cosmological model with great precision from a combination of several different experiments , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig42 ] .",
    "we have entered a new era in cosmology , were a host of high - precision measurements are already posing challenges to our understanding of the universe : the density of ordinary matter and the total amount of energy in the universe ; the microwave background anisotropies on a fine - scale resolution ; primordial deuterium abundance from quasar absorption lines ; the acceleration parameter of the universe from high - redshift supernovae observations ; the rate of expansion from gravitational lensing ; large scale structure measurements of the distribution of galaxies and their evolution ; and many more , which already put constraints on the parameter space of cosmological models , see fig .",
    "[ fig30 ] .",
    "however , these are only the forerunners of the precision era in cosmology that will dominate the new millennium , and will make cosmology a phenomenological science .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that all physical theories are approximations of reality that can fail if pushed too far .",
    "physical science advances by incorporating earlier theories that are experimentally supported into larger , more encompassing frameworks . the standard big bang theory is supported by a wealth of evidence , nobody really doubts its validity anymore . however , in the last decade it has been incorporated into the larger picture of cosmological inflation , which has become the new standard cosmological model .",
    "all cosmological issues are now formulated in the context of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "it is the best explanation we have at the moment for the increasing set of cosmological observations .    in the next few years",
    "we will have an even larger set of high - quality observations that will test inflation and the cold dark matter paradigm of structure formation , and determine most of the 12 or more parameters of the standard cosmological model to a few percent accuracy ( see table  1 ) .",
    "it may seem that with such a large number of parameters one can fit almost anything .",
    "however , that is not the case when there is enough quantity and quality of data .",
    "an illustrative example is the standard model of particle physics , with around 21 parameters and a host of precise measurements from particle accelerators all over the world .",
    "this model is , nowadays , rigurously tested , and its parameters measured to a precision of better than 1% in some cases .",
    "it is clear that high - precision measurements will make the standard model of cosmology as robust as that of particle physics . in fact",
    ", it has been the technological advances of particle physics detectors that are mainly responsible for the burst of new data coming from cosmological observations .",
    "this is definitely a very healthy field , but there is still a lot to do . with the advent of better and larger precision experiments , cosmology is becoming a mature science , where speculation has given way to phenomenology .",
    "there are still many unanswered fundamental questions in this emerging picture of cosmology .",
    "for instance , we still do not know the nature of the inflaton field , is it some new fundamental scalar field in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , or is it just some effective description of a more fundamental high energy interaction ?",
    "hopefully , in the near future , experiments in particle physics might give us a clue to its nature .",
    "inflation had its original inspiration in the higgs field , the scalar field supposed to be responsible for the masses of elementary particles ( quarks and leptons ) and the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "such a field has not been found yet , and its discovery at the future particle colliders would help understand one of the truly fundamental problems in physics , the origin of masses . if the experiments discover something completely new and unexpected , it would automatically affect inflation at a fundamental level .",
    "one of the most difficult challenges that the new cosmology will have to face is understanding the origin of the cosmological constant , if indeed it is confirmed by independent sets of observations . ever since einstein introduced it as a way to counteract gravitational attraction , it has haunted cosmologists and particle physicists for decades .",
    "we still do not have a mechanism to explain its extraordinarily small value , 120 orders of magnitude below what is predicted by quantum physics . for several decades",
    "there has been the reasonable speculation that this fundamental problem may be related to the quantization of gravity .",
    "general relativity is a classical theory of space - time , and it has proved particularly difficult to construct a consistent quantum theory of gravity , since it involves fundamental issues like causality and the nature of space - time itself .    the value of the cosmological constant predicted by quantum physics is related to our lack of understanding of gravity at the microscopic level .",
    "however , its effect is dominant at the very largest scales of clusters or superclusters of galaxies , on truly macroscopic scales .",
    "this hints at what is known in quantum theory as an anomaly , a quantum phenomenon relating both ultraviolet ( microscopic ) and infrared ( macroscopic ) divergences .",
    "we can speculate that perhaps general relativity is not the correct description of gravity on the very largest scales .",
    "in fact , it is only in the last few billion years that the observable universe has become large enough that these global effects could be noticeable . in its infancy , the universe was much smaller than it is now , and , presumably , general relativity gave a correct description of its evolution , as confirmed by the successes of the standard big bang theory .",
    "as it expanded , larger and larger regions were encompassed , and , therefore , deviations from general relativity would slowly become important .",
    "it may well be that the recent determination of a cosmological constant from observations of supernovae at high redshifts is hinting at a fundamental misunderstanding of gravity on the very large scales .",
    "if this were indeed the case , we should expect that the new generation of precise cosmological observations will not only affect our cosmological model of the universe but also a more fundamental description of nature .",
