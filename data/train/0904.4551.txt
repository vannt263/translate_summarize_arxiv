    "coalescence of binary neutron stars is one of the most promising sources for kilometer - size laser interferometric detectors such as the ligo  @xcite , geo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , and tama  @xcite .",
    "latest statistical estimate indicates that detection rate of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars will be 1 event per @xmath14300 years for the first - generation interferometric detectors and @xmath15100 events per year for the advanced detectors  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that gravitational waves from binary neutron stars will be detected within the next decade .",
    "the merger of the binary neutron stars has also been proposed as a likely candidate for the central engine of short @xmath16-ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite .",
    "the observational facts that short grbs have a cosmological origin ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) indicate that the central engine supplies a large amount of energy @xmath17 ergs in a very short time scale @xmath181 s  @xcite .",
    "according to a standard scenario based on the merger hypothesis , a stellar - mass black hole surrounded by a hot and massive disk ( or torus ) should be formed after the merger .",
    "possible relevant processes to extract the energy of this black hole - accretion disk system for launching a relativistic jet are neutrino - anti neutrino annihilation and magnetically driven mechanisms .",
    "recent semi - analytic calculations ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) show that an accretion rate of @xmath19/s is required for neutrino annihilation models to achieve sufficiently high energy efficiency . also , recent numerical studies ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that if the disk had a mass @xmath20 , it could supply the required energy by neutrino radiation .",
    "recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite of ( kerr ) black hole - accretion disk system find that the rotational energy of the black hole can be extracted via magnetohydrodynamics processes as a form of the poynting flux .",
    "in particular the results are in general agreement with the predictions of blandford and znajek @xcite . in this case",
    ", the black hole is required to be rapidly rotating for efficient energy extraction .",
    "this fact motivates to calculate final mass and spin of the black hole formed after the merger , and to clarify whether such a massive disk can be formed , and to clarify what type of the progenitors are necessary for formation of a system composed of a black hole and a massive disk .    for theoretically studying the late inspiral , merger , and ringdown phases of the binary neutron stars ,",
    "numerical relativity is the unique approach . until quite recently",
    ", there has been no longterm general relativistic simulation that self - consistently clarifies the inspiral and merger phases because of limitation of the computational resources or difficulty in simulating a black - hole spacetime , although a number of simulations have been done for qualitative studies @xcite .",
    "the most crucial drawbacks in the previous works are summarized as follows ( but see refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( i ) the simulations were not able to be continued for a long time after formation of a black hole and/or ( ii ) the simulations were short - term for the inspiral phase ; the inspiral motion of the binary neutron stars is followed only for @xmath212 orbits .",
    "the simulations were usually started with a quasiequilibrium state which is obtained assuming that approaching velocity between two neutron stars is zero , that is not realistic . as a result of this treatment ,",
    "non - zero approaching velocity at the onset of merger is not correctly taken into account , and moreover , effects of non - zero eccentricity could play an unfavored role @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform an improved simulation overcoming these drawbacks ; ( i ) we adopt a moving - puncture approach @xcite , which enables us to evolve black hole spacetimes for an arbitrarily long time ; ( ii ) we prepare binary neutron stars in quasiequilibrium states of a large separation as the initial condition . in the chosen initial data , the binary neutron stars spend @xmath22 orbits in the inspiral phase before the onset of merger , and hence , approximately correct non - zero approaching velocity and nearly zero eccentricity results . furthermore , we add a non - zero approaching velocity at @xmath23 . the magnitude of the approaching velocity can be estimated by a post - newtonian ( pn ) analysis ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : form ] in detail ) . adding the approaching velocity suppresses an artificial orbital eccentricity caused by an incompleteness of the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "in addition , a non - uniform grid with a sufficiently large computational domain @xcite is employed to perform longterm accurate simulations with a relatively low computational cost .",
    "a longterm simulation of binary neutron stars , in which the inspiral phase is followed for 35 orbits , has very recently been performed by baiotti et al . using the polytropic and @xmath0-law eoss for modeling the neutron stars @xcite . with these simple eoss",
    ", they self - consistently investigated the inspiral , merger , and ringdown processes .",
    "however , as is well known , such eoss are oversimplified for modeling the neutron stars , and hence , the results are only qualitative . in this paper",
    ", we perform a longterm simulation not with such simple eoss but by adopting a nuclear - theory - based eos .",
    "we focus in particular on quantitatively clarifying the formation process of a black hole for the case that it is formed promptly ( i.e. , in the dynamical time scale @xmath212 ms ) after the onset of merger . more specifically ,",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is ( 1 ) to determine the condition for prompt black hole formation , ( 2 ) to determine the final mass and spin of the black hole formed after the merger , ( 3 ) to clarify quantitative features of gravitational waves emitted in the merger and ringdown phases , and ( 4 ) to estimate the mass of disks surrounding the formed black hole .    here , some words of explanation are necessary about nuclear - theory - based eos ( often referred to as realistic eos ) .",
    "there are two types of nuclear - theory - based eoss for modeling the neutron stars .",
    "one is zero - temperature nuclear eos such as the akmal - pandharipande - ravenhall ( apr ) eos @xcite .",
    "this type of eoss could be suitable for modeling not so young neutron stars , such as neutron stars in binary neutron stars just before the merger , for which the thermal energy per nucleon is much smaller than the fermi energy .",
    "the other is finite - temperature eos such as the shen s eos @xcite .",
    "this type of eoss should be employed for studying high - energy phenomena such as supernova core collapse and the merger phase of binary neutron stars .",
    "one problem faced when choosing eoss is that no one knows the truly realistic eos for high - density nuclear matter .",
    "this implies that for studying the inspiral and merger phases of binary neutron stars by numerical simulation , it is necessary to systematically perform many simulations adopting a variety of nuclear - theory - based eoss .",
    "indeed , one of the important roles in gravitational - wave detection is to constrain nuclear eos from detected gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , numerical simulation for a variety of eoss has to be performed for deriving all the possible gravitational waveforms .",
    "there are many cold eoss that have been proposed @xcite , and a systematic theoretical survey of the gravitational waveforms for clarifying their dependence on the eoss is possible .",
    "by contrast , there are only a few finite - temperature eoss @xcite .",
    "this implies that a systematic study is not possible when adopting the finite - temperature eoss .    in the series of our papers @xcite , we have found that shock heating during the merger phase increases the thermal energy of the neutron stars .",
    "this indicates that adopting finite - temperature eoss is desirable for a sophisticated study of the merger process .",
    "however , the shock heating is not very strong during the merger and the thermal energy per nucleon after the shock heating is only @xmath24 of the fermi energy of the nuclear matter in the central region of the merged object ( see sec .",
    "thus , the thermal energy is not essential at least for short - term evolution of the main body of the merged object . in particular ,",
    "the thermal energy plays a minor role in determining the criterion for prompt black hole formation at the merger and its process . because of this reason , in the previous two papers @xcite",
    ", we have adopted a hybrid eos in which the pressure and thermal energy are divided into cold and hot parts .",
    "the cold part is determined by the zero - temperature nuclear - theory - based eoss , and the hot part is simply modeled by a @xmath0-law eos . in this method , the main part ( cold part ) of the eos is appropriately modeled , although a minor part ( finite - temperature part ) is modeled in an approximate manner .",
    "the merit of this eos is that a variety of the cold eoss can be systematically employed for the simulation .",
    "the hybrid eos may not be appropriate for studying the longterm evolution of a hypermassive neutron star which is formed when the total mass of the system is not large enough for prompt black hole formation .",
    "the reason for this is that in the hypermassive neutron star , longterm shock heating and cooling via neutrino emission are likely to play a role .",
    "however , for studying prompt black hole formation , which is the main subject of this paper , the hybrid eos seems to be acceptable because the roles of the shock heating and neutrino cooling do not seem to be essential .",
    "thus , following previous papers @xcite , numerical simulations are performed , employing the hybrid eos . specifically , we adopt the apr eos for the cold part following ref .",

    "the surface integral is performed for several radii near the outer boundaries , and we check that the resulting gravitational waveforms depend only weakly on the extracted radii .",

    "the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves extracted at several radii should be extrapolated to obtain those at infinity for deriving precise waveforms , as often done in the simulation for binary black holes  @xcite .",
    "however , numerical waveforms computed in hydrodynamic simulation are not as precise as those in the simulations for vacuum spacetime , because the order of the accuracy is reduced at shocks , discontinuities , and places where the gradient of hydrodynamic quantities is large in the standard numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "this implies that numerical error is primarily determined by such sources , and hence , the finiteness of the extraction radius does not become the main source of the numerical error . to illustrate this fact , we generate fig .",

    "this plot shows that the amplitude depends very weakly on the extraction radius ; relative difference among three results is much smaller than 1% , typical error size induced by the poor resolution of hydrodynamics mentioned above .",

    "we compute total radiated energy and angular momentum by time integration as @xmath87      gravitational waveforms in the inspiral phase computed in numerical simulation should be compared with those by the pn approximation , because it provides an accurate waveform if the orbital velocity @xmath88 is not extremely relativistic ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) . assuming that binary components are point masses and their quasicircular orbits evolve adiabatically",
    ", orbital evolution of the binary stars can be analytically determined with 3pn accuracy and gravitational waveforms are derived with the 3.5pn accuracy @xcite .",
    "recently , several phenomenological prescription for improving the pn results , which is applicable even to highly relativistic orbits of @xmath90 , have been proposed . among them",
    ", high - accuracy simulations for equal - mass and nonspinning binary black holes  @xcite have proven that the so - called taylor t4 formula provides the orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms with a high accuracy at least up to about one orbit before the onset of the merger .",
    "the taylor t4 formula appears to be a good approximation also for unequal - mass and nonspinning binaries  @xcite ( but see ref .",
    "@xcite for a depression of the accuracy for the taylor t4 in spinning cases ) .",
    "because we focus only on nonspinning binaries , it is safe to assume that the taylor t4 formula would be a good approximate formula , and thus , we explore a match between the numerical and taylor - t4 s waveforms for the inspiral phase .    one issue in comparison in the present context",
    "is that the effect of tidal deformation of neutron stars , which is not taken into account in the taylor t4 formula , plays an important role for close orbits .",
    "this implies that the numerical waveforms should not agree with the waveforms by the taylor t4 formula for such orbits .",
    "thus , we compare two waveforms for @xmath91 ( see sec .",
    "iii a for definition of @xmath6 ) .    more specifically , in comparison , two waveforms have to appropriately align as done in refs .",
    "our procedure in this work is as follows : first we calculate the orbital angular velocity by @xmath92 .",
    "then , we determine the reference time at which two waveforms give the same value of @xmath93 .",
    "recent studies in the context of the binary black holes have shown that the reference value of @xmath93 should be @xmath94 because beyond this value the pn approximation breaks down   @xcite .",
    "for the binary neutron stars , the value of @xmath95 is even too large because the compactness of neutron stars is much smaller than that of black holes and hence the merger already started at such a high value .",
    "also , the effect of tidal deformation of neutron stars plays an important role for @xmath96 . due to this reason",
    ", the reference value of @xmath93 is chosen to be @xmath97 for all the runs in this paper .",
    "except for the orbit just before the merger , binary neutron stars are in a quasicircular orbit because the time scale of gravitational radiation reaction at newtonian order @xmath98 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is several times longer than the orbital period .",

    "since it is covered by @xmath12580 grid points , we expect that numerical results in this paper are much more accurate than those in the previous work . in physical units , the grid spacing around the neutron stars are about 200 meter for the highest grid resolution . on the other hand , the grid spacing in a wave zone , where gravitational waves are extracted , is @xmath126 km .",
    "radius of apparent horizon of black hole finally formed is covered by about ten grid points .",

    "<S> this value depends weakly on the total mass and mass ratio , and is about @xmath13 larger than that of a black hole formed from nonspinning binary black holes ; ( iv ) for the black - hole formation case , fourier spectrum shape of gravitational waves emitted in the merger and ringdown phases has a universal qualitative feature irrespective of the total mass and mass ratio , but quantitatively , the spectrum reflects the parameters of the binary neutron stars . </S>"
