    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we plot the neutral excitation gaps as a function of @xmath56 near the transition point from the spt phase to the zfm phase for various @xmath77 . when @xmath80 , a gap closure occurs at the transition point . </S>",
    "<S> however , once @xmath77 becomes finite but still very small , we do not observe such gap closure . in this case , the spt phase and the zfm phase can adiabatically evolve into each other . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a direct evidence that the spt phase is protected by time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , according to the group cohomology theory , this spt phase is the haldane phase @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> haldane phase is usually identified by a nonlocal string order @xcite , which can now be observed @xcite in quantum gas . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our model , this phase is protected by time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> there is no conventional string order @xcite .     as a function of @xmath56 at @xmath72 . </S>",

    "<S> four entanglement spectra represented by triangles ( @xmath82 ) almost overlap . </S>",
    "<S> , width=291 ]    instead , haldane phase is generally characterized by the even - fold degeneracy @xcite of the entanglement spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be verified in our dmrg simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement spectra are defined as @xmath83 with @xmath84 the eigenvalues of the reduced density - matrix , which is readily available in our dmrg simulations . in our work </S>",
    "<S> , the reduced - density matrix is obtained by tracing out half of a chain . in the main panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , we present four lowest entanglement spectra at @xmath72 for @xmath85 . in the deep haldane phase , </S>",
    "<S> the four entanglement spectra are already degenerate ( within our numerical error ) . in the vicinity of the right boundary , slight </S>",
    "<S> splitting of the entanglement spectrum is observed . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig5 ] , we plot the lowest eight entanglement spectra for @xmath81 as a function of @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest four spectra merge as the size increases and the other four already overlap for our finite sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we also check some other spectrum and confirm the degeneracy is a multiple of four . </S>",
    "<S> this provides robust numerical evidence for the spt phase . </S>",
    "<S> we want to mention that the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum is closely related to the boundary conditions . with obc , </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic degeneracy will become twofold@xcite .    in conclusion , by using density - matrix renormalization group method </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate numerically a one - dimensional correlated bosonic lattice model with a synthetic soc that was realized in recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we found an spt phase in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> such an spt phase has a unique ground state , gapful bulk excitations for pbc as well as gapless edge modes for obc . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the extended bose - hubbard model , this model has no inversion symmetry due to the presence of the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate numerically that the spt phase is protected by time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is then classified into a haldane phase . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm this by the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this topologically nontrivial phase , we find four other phases in the phase diagram : a mott insulating phase with no long range order , a yfm superfluid and a zfm insulating phase , where time - reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken , and a density - wave phase , where the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken . </S>",
    "<S> the spt phase can be identified by measuring the dynamic structure factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of gapless edge modes in the spt phase can be directly observed in ultracold systems @xcite . </S>",
