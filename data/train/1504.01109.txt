    "for the first event , the filament did not erupt within 3 days , instead , it was separated into two parts ( north and south filaments ) .",
    "the close neighborhood and common direction of the bright threads in the filament and the open ar fan loops suggest similar magnetic connectivity of these two flux systems . these threads in both parts of the filament may imply the configuration of the magnetic field lines ( li & zhang 2013b ; joshi et al .",

    "these small - scale magnetic fields seemed to disturb the stability of the south filament , which resulted in the partial eruption of the filament .",
    "the statistics showed that the shorter distance between the new active regions and quiescent filaments , the less time between active region appearance and filament disappearance ( bruzek 1952 ; balasubramaniam et al . 2011 ) .",
    "thus the time interval of 4 days is too long and it is not reasonable to correlate the ar emergence within the filament channel with the later eruption .",
    "a case of filament eruption on the 4th day after a new flux emergence away from the filament channel was analyzed by feynman & martin ( 1995 ) .",
    "the active region continued to emerge on the day of the eruption and they attributed the eruption to the flux emergence .",
    "however , in our first event , the ar emergence ceased about 2 days before the eruption .",
    "we suggest that the eruption of the south filament is caused by the emergence and cancellation of the small - scale magnetic flux ( figure 5 ) nearby the barbs about 20 hr before its eruption .    in the second event ,",
    "the emerging flux occurred nearby a barb of the filament with a maximum magnetic flux of 4.2@xmath010@xmath2 mx , about one order of magnitude less than that of the first event .",

    "the main body of the filament in the second event underwent a transition from slow - rise phase to fast - rise phase .",
    "the velocity of the filament increased to 170 km s@xmath6 and the acceleration reached about 260 m s@xmath15 about 20 min after the start of the fast - rise phase .    according to the models of aulanier et al .",

    "the change of the parasitic patches nearby the barbs is responsible for the evolution of barbs . in our study ,",
    "the observed flux convergence and cancellation of parasitic polarity disturbed the magnetic fields passing through the barb , and the tether - cutting reconnection ( moore et al . 2001 ) between the field lines supporting the barb material ( magnetic dips nearby the barb ) and nearby network fields might be triggered .",
    "then the stability of the filament was catastrophically destroyed and the filament was erupted rapidly .",

    "no barbs of the filament are observed nearby the emerging ar .",
    "afterwards , the emergence and cancellation of small - scale magnetic flux occurred nearby the barbs and the south filament erupted .",
    "for the second event , the emerging magnetic flux nearby the barb followed by flux cancellation resulted in the filament eruption about 20 hr later despite the fact that the emerging flux was one order of magnitude less than that of the ar in the first event .",
    "our findings imply that the location of emerging flux within the filament channel is probably crucial to filament evolution . if the flux emergence appears nearby the barbs , flux cancellation of emerging flux with the filament magnetic fields is prone to occur .",
    "the flux cancellation results in the tethers to cut and reconnection to take place beneath the filament ( vemareddy et al .",
    "2012 ; kuridze et al .",
    "2013 ; huang et al . 2014",
    "; jing et al . 2014 ) .",
    "thus flux emergence / cancelation and tether - cutting reconnection around the barbs of the filament cause the destabilization of the filament and the onset of its eruption .",
    "if the flux emergence within the filament channel is far away from the barbs , the occurrence of flux cancellation between emerging flux and the filament magnetic fields is not easy , and the equilibrium of filament is not destroyed .",
    "the comparison of the two events shows that the emergence of an entire ar may still not be enough to disrupt the stability of a filament system and the actual eruption does occur only after the flux cancellation sets in .",
    "zuccarello et al . (",
    "2014 ) observed flux cancellation toward the compact polarity inversion line during the 8 - 10 hr preceding the eruption .",
    "sterling et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also suggested that the main filament ejection was triggered by flux cancelation between the positive flux elements and the surrounding negative field . in our work ,",
    "the filament eruptions studied are associated with flux emergence , but occur only after completion of the emergence and/or after the onset of the magnetic cancellation following the emergence .",
    "although we do not perform modelling of the magnetic field of the filaments and their barbs , our observations of the emergence followed by cancellation in relation to the timing of filament eruptions add to the debate on the mechanism behind destabilization of solar structures .",

    "<S> we make a comparative analysis for two filaments that showed quite different activation in response to the flux emergence within the filament channels . </S>",
    "<S> the observations from the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) and global oscillation network group ( gong ) are carried out to analyze the two filaments on 2013 august 17 - 20 and september 29 . </S>",
    "<S> the first event showed that the main body of the filament was separated into two parts when an active region ( ar ) emerged with a maximum magnetic flux of about 6.4@xmath010@xmath1 mx underlying the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the close neighborhood and common direction of the bright threads in the filament and the open ar fan loops suggest similar magnetic connectivity of these two flux systems . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium of the filament was not destroyed within 3 days after the start of the emergence of the ar . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> similar observations have never been reported before . in the second event , </S>",
    "<S> the emerging flux occurred nearby a barb of the filament with a maximum magnetic flux of 4.2@xmath010@xmath2 mx , about one order of magnitude less than that of the first event . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging flux drove the convergence of two patches of parasitic polarity in the vicinity of the barb , and resulted in cancellation between the parasitic polarity and nearby network fields . </S>",
    "<S> about 20 hours after the onset of the emergence , the filament was entirely erupted . </S>",
    "<S> our findings imply that the location of emerging flux within the filament channel is probably crucial to filament evolution . if the flux emergence appears nearby the barbs , flux cancellation of emerging flux with the filament magnetic fields is prone to occur , which probably causes the filament eruption . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the two events shows that the emergence of an entire ar may still not be enough to disrupt the stability of a filament system and the actual eruption does occur only after the flux cancellation sets in . </S>"
