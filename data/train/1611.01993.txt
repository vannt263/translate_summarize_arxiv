    "second law of thermodynamics had been and will always be one of the strongest rules of nature .",
    "however , its validity has been questioned many times but it always hold on average . challenging the validity of the second law dates back nearly 150 years ago , when maxwell proposed his famous thought experiment @xcite . in his gedanken experiment he considered a box filled with gas .",
    "now , this box is divided into two parts by a partition . in that partition",
    "there is a small door whose dimension is comparable to the gas molecule .",
    "a demon monitors the gas particles and allow to pass them through the door .",
    "when a faster molecule comes from left , the demon allows it to transfer into right side by opening the door , while the demon closes the door if a slower molecule comes from the left . on the other hand , the demon only allows to transfer slower molecules from right side to the left .",
    "hence over a course of time sorting takes place and right part of the box contains faster molecules compared to the left . since the average kinetic energy of gas particles determines the temperature of the gas , over time colder side become more colder and hotter side become more hotter .",
    "this happens when the demon monitors the gas particles by only knowing velocity of each individual gas molecules .",
    "this seems to be violation of the second law . because the second law forbids transfer of heat from cold body to hot body without doing any work .",
    "there is another famous example , given by szilard in 1921 , where a demon is involved and second law is apparently broken @xcite .",
    "he formulated an engine that can extract energy from a single heat bath and convert it into useful work in presence of information in a cyclic process . in his original derivation",
    "he took a single particle confined in a box of volume v and the box is connected to a bath with temperature t. a demon is placed to monitor the system and extract energy .",
    "first the demon put a partition quickly in the middle and separate the box into two equal parts .",
    "the gas molecule would be confined into any one of the parts .",
    "then it measures in which part the molecule is in .",
    "depending on the measurement , the partition is moved isothermally such that @xmath0 amount of work is extracted . finally the partition is removed and the system goes to its original state . for classical systems , insertion and removal of the partition do not need any energy .",
    "hence , one can extract energy from heat bath repeatedly which is surprising and the system is termed as a perpetual machine",
    ". however , it is unfair to treat a single particle kicking randomly to the wall of the box as an ideal gas .",
    "but , any system that undergoes a phase - space splitting can be used as a working system to harness energy . in both the cases the demon uses its acquired information smartly and decreases the entropy of the system without performing any work by himself .",
    "it can be shown that one can perform measurement without involving any energy cost .",
    "the paradox of this apparent violation of second law can be resolved if one includes memory of the demon as a part of the whole system .",
    "the memory which records the state of the system has to be reset to its initial state .",
    "this process is called erasure. it is a irreversible process because there is no one to one correspondence between input and output of this process . according to the landauer principle any logically irreversible transformation of classical information",
    "is necessarily accompanied by dissipation of at least @xmath1 of heat per lost bit @xcite .",
    "this leads to an entropy increase of the bath at least by @xmath2 per bit .",
    "entropy cost for resetting demon s memory is always larger than the initial entropy reduction , thereby safeguarding the second law .",
    "the importance of szilard engine and maxwell demon is that they made information in the same footing as entropy that will be discussed below in more detail .",
    "in information theory , the shannon entropy of a random variable x with probability density at any time @xmath3 , is defined as @xmath4 .",
    "shannon entropy denotes the uncertainty of the random variable and measures the amount of information required to describe the random variable .",
    "when x represents the microscopic state of a physical system one can define the non - equilibrium entropy as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "recent development of stochastic thermodynamics reveals that the shannon entropy has a clear meaning in certain situation and determines the energetics in non - equilibrium processes for systems connected to one or more thermodynamic reservoirs .",
    "let us consider a system connected to a bath of temperature t. the system is evolved by a protocol @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes corresponding time dependent hamiltonian .",
    "then the system energy at any time is given by @xmath9 corresponding non - equilibrium free energy is defined as @xcite    @xmath10    here",
    "t denotes the temperature of the bath to which the system is connected .",
    "suppose the protocol is kept fixed at a particular value of @xmath7 then the system will reach to the equilibrium distribution @xmath11 with @xmath12 the inverse bath temperature and the partition function @xmath13 .",
    "note that equilibrium distribution should not depend on time . here",
    "the time in the bracket just denotes the value of the protocol @xmath7 at which the equilibration is done .",
    "now if we put @xmath14 in eq.([noneq - ent ] ) then the non - equilibrium entropy will coincide with the corresponding equilibrium entropy and one can recover usual relation @xmath15 with @xmath16 as equilibrium free energy when the protocol fixed at the value of @xmath7    suppose the system is initially in a non - equilibrium state @xmath17 .",
    "then it is evolved by an external protocol @xmath7 upto time @xmath18 and the system reaches to another non - equilibrium state @xmath19 . @xmath20 and @xmath21 represents the work done on the system and heat transferred to the bath during this process . then according to the first law of thermodynamics , the internal energy change of the system during this evolution becomes @xmath22 the change in non - equilibrium system entropy @xmath23 consists of two terms .",
    "total entropy production @xmath24 is strictly positive quantity .",
    "the second term is the entropy flow to the bath and is defined as @xmath25 . using first law and the definition of non - equilibrium free energy one can get the second law for non - equilibrium regime @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "that means the extractable work @xmath28 is always bounded by decrease of non - equilibrium free energy difference @xmath29 .",
    "this is a more general equation . now",
    "if the system starts from equilibrium and reaches to another equilibrium point after evolution then the above equation will be reduced to the usual equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes dissipated work and @xmath32 is the equilibrium free energy change .",
    "in information theory , the relative entropy or kullback leibler distance measures the distance between two distributions and is defined as @xmath33 this distance the distinguishability between two distributions .",
    "however , it is not symmetric .",
    "if the two distributions coincide , @xmath34 then relative entropy vanishes .",
    "physically @xmath35 is the number of bits required on average to describe the random variable in terms of @xmath36 . using the property , @xmath37 for @xmath38 we have @xmath39=\\sum_x [ p(x)-q(x)]=1 - 1=0,\\nn\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that relative entropy is always positive .",
    "the mutual information between two random variables u and v is defined as @xmath40 mutual information is basically the relative entropy between the joint distribution of the two random variables with their product distribution .",
    "note that , unlike relative entropy , mutual information is symmetric i.e , @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is always positive and vanishes only when these two random variables u and v are statistically independent i.e. , there is exists no correlation between them .",
    "one can rewrite @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the conditional entropy and quantifies uncertainty of u for given v. now , @xmath45 represents uncertainty of u. hence , mutual information denotes the reduction of uncertainty of one random variable due to knowledge of another .",
    "we will now discuss the effect of measurement on a system with probability density @xmath46 .",
    "suppose , a measurement is performed and m is the outcome like left or right in the szilard engine .",
    "the probability density will be updated to @xmath47 after this measurement .",
    "if the system is initially in equilibrium , @xmath47 will not be canonical due to measurement .",
    "thus measurement leads the system to a non - equilibrium state although there is no energy cost .",
    "the change in non - equilibrium entropy due to measurement is @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "taking the average over all possible outcomes with probability @xmath51 , the non - equilibrium entropy change becomes @xmath52 note that , in measurement process neither the hamiltonian nor the micro - state of the system is affected .",
    "that means the average energy of the system does not change due to measurement .",
    "hence the non - equilibrium free energy change will become @xmath53 as , @xmath54 there is always increase in non - equilibrium free energy which can be eventually used to extract work in an isothermal process at later times .",
    "this explains the functioning of a szilard engine in a cyclic process .",
    "information seems to be an abstract quantity at first glance .",
    "however , it is not .",
    "when a measurement is performed , the obtained information is being stored in a piece of paper or in the hard - disk etc . in these perspective",
    ", landauer shed new light in his famous article information is physical @xcite . any physical system with multiple distinguishable meta - stable states",
    "can be used to store the information . however",
    ", these states should have long enough lifetimes and should not be affected by the environmental fluctuations or any external constraints .",
    "then only a system can act reliably as memory in desired time .",
    "it means ergodicity must be broken or effectively broken in the timescale when memory is reliable .",
    "the total phase space @xmath55 is split into several ergodic regions @xmath56 for each memory outcome @xmath57 .",
    "magnetization in a small ferromagnetic domain of a standard magnetic memory or high energy barriers separating microscopic degrees of freedom in single electron memory are few examples in this regard .",
    "let @xmath51 denotes the probability to be in the ergodic region @xmath58 of the memory .",
    "now if the memory is in local equilibrium , one can take @xmath59 and @xmath60 as average energy and non - equilibrium entropy of the corresponding ergodic region .",
    "the non - equilibrium free energy of the memory can be written as @xcite @xmath61 where , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the shannon entropy of the informational states .",
    "note that , total entropy of the memory is sum of shannon entropy @xmath64 and the individual internal entropies @xmath60 . now after manipulation of the memory , we assume that the hamiltonian of the system reaches to its initial hamiltonian .",
    "then we need to concern only about the expression of @xmath51 for particular memory state .",
    "suppose during measurement the state changes from @xmath65 with probability @xmath66 to the state @xmath67 with probability @xmath51 .",
    "the change in free energy for the memory for this case will be @xmath68 .",
    "similarly for resetting the memory to its original state @xmath65 the free energy change will be @xmath69 and work done to reset the memory must follow @xmath70 in this respect , if one takes symmetric memory @xmath71 , the free energy change will be reduced to only the shannon entropy change @xmath72 . now if we reset the state to a standard state such that @xmath73 and all other @xmath74 then @xmath75 .",
    "this is the `` restore to zero process '' and one gets @xmath76 . if the memory consist of only two states and for random bit @xmath77 , one obtain the celebrated landauer s limit @xmath78 while equality holds for reversible processes .",
    "this is the famous landauer s principle which states that the minimum work need to erase one bit of information is @xmath79 .",
    "the opposite of the restore to zero processes increases disorder in the states of memory , as a result , one can easily extract work out of this process .",
    "this trick is used in recently proposed autonomous information engine model where information is used as a fuel to extract thermodynamic work in isothermal process .",
    "hence an ordered state of memory registrar can be treated as a reservoir of information and can be taken to be in same footing with other thermodynamic reservoirs like thermal or chemical bath .",
    "in this section we have described a model where information is used as a fuel to extract work @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a system ( demon ) , a work source and an information reservoir ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the system can interact with two thermal reservoirs , hot and cold .",
    "a mass that can be lowered by gravity or pulled up against gravity is used as a work source .",
    "a stream of bits written on a tape is used as an information reservoir .",
    "the information can be written/ removed during the operation .",
    "the system can exchange information with the information reservoir but not energy .",
    "although , it can exchange energy with the work source and the thermal bath .",
    "the dynamics is taken autonomous that means there is no external control .",
    "the system reaches unique steady state depending on its parameter .",
    "the main motivation of this study is to find the effect of thermal bias along with the work source and informational source .",
    "recently d mandal and c jarzynski has given a simple model @xcite where the system is connected with single bath and it exhibit erasure and engine . in another model",
    "@xcite it exhibit refrigerator and erasure . in the present model one can get engine , refrigerator and erasure simultaneously in a single model .",
    "the system can perform as engine by extracting energy out of the thermal reservoirs , refrigerator by transferring heat from cold to hot bath and erasure by removing information content in the tape .",
    "we will explain these definitions in more detail in later section .",
    "it is observed , even more surprisingly , the system can perform any two of these behaviors simultaneously ! however , these behaviors are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , the efficiency of the engine and the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator can go beyond the carnot limit .",
    "let us take a three state system ( a , b , c ) and these states are non - degenerate fig.([model2 ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two successive energy levels is taken to be same ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the transition can occur between a to b , b to c and vice versa by exchanging heat from the cold bath spontaneously with temperature @xmath81 and internal energy of the system gets changed .",
    "however , the transition between a to c and vice versa is restricted .",
    "it depends on the value of the interacting bit written on the tape .",
    "as the bit has two states 0 and 1 , the combined system has 6 states .",
    "the bit state is changed from 0 to 1 when the transition occur from c0 to a1 ( clockwise rotation ) and vice versa ( anti - clockwise rotation ) . however , transition between c1 and a0 is not allowed .",
    "note that , the bit state do not change when transition occurs between a and b , b and c. during the transition from c0 to a1 ( clockwise rotation ) , energy is absorbed from the hot bath at temperature @xmath82 by an amount @xmath83 while the system performs w amount of work by pulling a mass m to a height @xmath84 by a frictionless pulley in a gravitational force field g ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "note that , during this transition , the internal energy of the demon is increased by @xmath86 .",
    "using first law one can write    @xmath87     0 , the mass is lifted at an amount @xmath84 for every transition c @xmath88 a while for every transition a @xmath88 c the mass is lowered by same amount .",
    "however @xmath89 0 the mass is connected to right side of the small circle , so the transition c @xmath88 a lowers the mass and the transition a @xmath88 c lift it up.,width=264 ]     similarly the difference between b and c is also @xmath80 .",
    "the energy absorbed / released during any transition between c0 and a1 is denoted as e such that @xmath90 .",
    "( b ) all the allowed transitions and corresponding bath where energy is exchanged.,width=264 ]    , width=113 ]    all the allowed transitions are shown in fig.([model2 ] ) and they form a linear chain fig.([model2 ] ) .",
    "the weight parameter @xmath91 is defined by @xmath92 and is bounded by @xmath93 .",
    "let the tape is moving with a speed @xmath94 and interaction happens only with the nearest bit ( one bit at a time ) . during time @xmath18",
    ", the system ( demon ) evolves along with the bit .",
    "then next bit arrive and earlier bit moves forward containing the information .",
    "note that only during the interaction with the system the bit may flip .",
    "if @xmath18 is small , system hardy evolves .",
    "however , if @xmath18 is large system gets enough opportunity to evolve along with the bit .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath96 denotes the probability of 0 and 1 in the incoming bit stream . @xmath97",
    ". then one can define @xmath98 as the probability of excess number of 0 in incoming bit stream .",
    "the shannon entropy of the incoming bit stream is defined as @xmath99 this shannon entropy measures amount of disorder present among the bits .",
    "however , we have ignored the correlation between the successive bits .",
    "it also quantifies the amount of information present in the bit stream .",
    "more disorder is equivalent to more information .",
    "note that , if every bits are zero the shannon entropy is zero . where it is again true when every states are 1 .",
    "shannon entropy becomes maximum when both 0 and 1 state are equally probable and its value then become @xmath100 .",
    "now if @xmath101 and @xmath102 represents the probability of 0 and 1 in the outgoing bit stream then corresponding shannon entropy will be @xmath103 the change of shannon entropy of the bits , written on the tape , will be simply @xmath104 . now , if @xmath105 , it means some information is written on the tape or the bits stream become more disordered . on the other",
    "if @xmath106 , it implies during the interaction with the demon some information has been erased and it acts as an erasure .",
    "if @xmath107 represents average number of clockwise ( cw ) rotation then @xmath108 where @xmath109  @xmath102 . during each cw rotation @xmath83 energy",
    "is absorbed from hot bath while system performs @xmath110 amount of work .",
    "hence the average heat dissipated to the hot bath will be given by @xmath111 and average work done on the system will be @xmath112 using the first law on can readily write the average heat dissipated to the cold bath as @xmath113 since the system operates in steady state the entropy production of the system ( demon ) will be zero .",
    "then total entropy production will be @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the bath entropy production . in next section",
    "the model is analyzed taking help of numerical simulation .",
    "this problem may become simpler by taking @xmath116 @xmath117 .",
    "this implies all the three states of the system are degenerate .",
    "due to presence of bits the joint state @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 has energy @xmath83 while @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 has energy zero .",
    "the transition between @xmath123 and @xmath118 takes place with the interaction of the bath @xmath82 and @xmath124 energy will be exchanged .",
    "then this problem will be reduced to original mandal jarzynski model @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the bath is set at @xmath125 .",
    "the interaction time with the demon with each bit is kept fixed at @xmath126 .",
    "then one can obtain the phase diagram numerically as shown in fig.([mandal ] ) by simply varying @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the system will acts as an engine ( red plus region ) by extracting heat from single heat bath and convert it completely into output work .",
    "this is quite surprising .",
    "however the entropy of the outgoing bits will be more compared to the incoming bits ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "hence in the expense of information as a fuel , the system performs an engine . in green region ,",
    "the system acts as an erasure where it erases information ( @xmath130 ) written on the tape while work is done on the system ( @xmath131 ) . in other region in phase space ( blue region ) , it neither perform as an engine ( @xmath131 ) nor a erasure ( @xmath129 ) and denoted by dud .     and cycle time @xmath132 .",
    "there are thee regions in the phase diagram namely i ) engine ( red plus ) , ii ) eraser ( green cross ) , iii ) dud ( blue star ) , width=264 ]    next we move to earlier problem .",
    "the temperature of the hot and cold bath is set at @xmath125 and @xmath133 respectively .",
    "the separation between two successive energy levels is taken at @xmath134 and @xmath132 .",
    "then one can obtain the phase diagram by simply varying @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "it is important to mention that the system experiences two forces ( randomization of bits and pull of gravity ) besides the thermal bias between two baths .",
    "the phase diagram is obtained due to the interplay of these three forces .     and @xmath133 . the other parameters set at @xmath80=0.5 and @xmath132 .",
    "the phase diagram consist of seven regions namely i)only engine ( red plus ) , ii ) only eraser ( green cross ) , iii ) dud ( blue star ) , iv ) only refrigerator ( pink open box ) , v ) eraser and refrigerator ( yellow open circle ) , vi)erasure and engine ( cyan full box ) , vii ) engine and refrigerator ( black full circle ) , width=264 ]    the phase diagram ( fig.([phase-1 - 0.5 ] ) ) consists of 7 regions .",
    "i ) in red plus region the system performs as an engine by extracting work @xmath135 on average while writing information on the tape @xmath136 .",
    "the efficiency of an engine @xmath137 can exceed carnot limit ( @xmath138 for this case ) .",
    "ii ) the system acts as an erasure @xmath139 in green cross region , while work is done in the system @xmath140 .",
    "iii ) in pink open box region , it performs as a refrigerator @xmath141 by transferring heat from cold bath while @xmath131 and @xmath136 .",
    "apart from these three regions , there are another three regions where combination of any two is possible . such as : iv ) in yellow open box region",
    "the system simultaneously acts as an erasure @xmath139 and refrigerator @xmath141 .",
    "however , in this regime , work is done on the system on average ; v ) in the triangular area in the middle ( cyan full box ) thermal bias plays a dominate role in such a way that the demon simultaneously performs as an erasure @xmath139 and engine @xmath135 by extracting work on average .",
    "vi ) in black full circle region , the demon transfer heat from cold bath @xmath141 as well as it extracted work on average @xmath135 .",
    "however on average information is written on the tape @xmath136 .",
    "the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator @xmath142 can take value beyond carnot limit ( @xmath143 for this case ) in this region and some part of pink box region vii ) finally in blue star region , the system does not acts as an engine , erasure or refrigerator and we call it dud .    it is observed @xmath144 throughout the phase space .",
    "hence , all the regions are consistent with the generalized second law of thermodynamics .",
    "information and thermodynamics are treated in a single framework .",
    "the generalized second law is proved when system starts and ends at non - equilibrium state .",
    "we have explained the performance of szilard engine which seems to violate the second law .",
    "we have shown that when measurement is performed , although the energy of the system is not changed , the non - equilibrium free energy apparently increases .",
    "hence one can extract energy in cyclic process from single heat bath using acquired information by measurement .",
    "however , erasure of stored information requires work to be done on system .",
    "a memory device can be used as a information reservoir which can be used to increase the performance of a device .",
    "we have formulated a simple model of autonomous information engine .",
    "we have found the system can act as an engine , refrigerator or an eraser .",
    "even combination of any two is possible in some parameter space .",
    "we have achieved the efficiency of the engine to be greater than carnot limit .",
    "the coefficient of performance of refrigerator also goes beyond the carnot limit .",
