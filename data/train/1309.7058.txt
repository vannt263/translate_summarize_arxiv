    "the growth of @xmath54 is regulated by the balance between the rates of ionization , @xmath100 , and recombination , @xmath101 .",
    "if recombinations are ignored , i.e. @xmath102 , then @xmath54 increases steeply , and the mw gets reionized at @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "thus , the larger is @xmath58 , the more gentle is the slope of the curve . at @xmath109",
    "the growth of @xmath54 temporarily decreases because of both the disappearance of pop  iii stars , producing more ionizing photons than pop  ii @xcite , and the quenching of sf in minihaloes .",
    "the rise of @xmath54 at @xmath110 is due to @xmath90 dwarf galaxies , which become the dominant stellar ( photon ) sources ( fig .",

    "the higher is @xmath58 , the later this condition is satisfied , and thus the lower is @xmath98 .",
    "the reionization histories obtained by assuming @xmath112 ( fig .",

    "an equally good agreement is achieved by adopting an escape fraction that increases with redshift at @xmath113 , and @xmath114 at @xmath12 ] , and @xmath116 . in this case",
    "the mw environment is @xmath117 reionized at @xmath5 , when @xmath0 dwarf galaxies dominate the sf ( fig .",
    "thus , @xmath99 yields the most conservative results for dwarf galaxies .    , averaged over 50 merger histories ( solid line as in fig .",
    "the contribution by galaxies with different masses is shown . ]    within this assumption we can inspect fig .  [ fig3 ] where we show , as a function of @xmath98 , the contribution of galaxies with different masses to the time - integrated comoving photon density , @xmath118 .",
    "we see that @xmath0 dwarf galaxies are the _ primary reionization sources _ of the mw environment , providing @xmath3 of the ionizing photons independent of @xmath98 , and thus of @xmath58 .",
    "their contribution rises up to @xmath119 for our reference model ( @xmath120 , @xmath7 ) . at @xmath113",
    "the reionization process is driven by @xmath20 dwarf galaxies , which provide @xmath121 of @xmath118 . at @xmath122",
    "the photo - dissociating / ionizing radiation produced by the _",
    "same _ dwarf galaxies quenches the sf in these systems , and the reionization is completed by @xmath123 dwarf galaxies , which account for @xmath124 of the ionizing photon budget at @xmath125 .",
    "the evolution of the metal filling factor , @xmath38 , is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] along with the contribution of galaxies within different mass ranges .",
    "we find that metals fill @xmath126 of the mw volume by @xmath96 , and @xmath127 by @xmath128 , implying that the metal enrichment of the mw environment proceeds slower than reionization . in fig .",
    "2b the @xmath2-evolution of the two filling factors are plotted against each other , and we can see that @xmath129 when @xmath130 , independent of the assumed @xmath58 value . in fig .",
    "2b we can also see the imprint of pop  iii stars , which accelerate the early evolution of @xmath54 but not @xmath38 .",
    "this is because in our model pop  iii stars are assumed to form with a standard imf , and so they have have harder spectra then pop  ii but same sn explosion energy .",
    "even with this conservative hypothesis we find that at @xmath131 _ dwarf galaxies _ can account for @xmath132 of the metal - enriched volume , and for @xmath133 at @xmath134 , when @xmath135 . at @xmath136",
    "we find that the gas in the mw environment is enriched up to an average metallicity @xmath137 ( see also fig .  4 of ssf07 ) , and that @xmath138 of these metals have been ejected from @xmath0 dwarf galaxies . at lower @xmath2 , radiative feedback processes ( and merging ) strongly reduce the sf in dwarf galaxies and thus their instantaneous metal - ejection rate . at @xmath10",
    "however , @xmath11 of @xmath139 still originates from these high-@xmath2 dwarfs , which therefore dominate the integrated contribution to the metal - enrichment of the mw environment .",
    "we used a data - calibrated cosmological model for the formation of the milky way to show that the high-@xmath2 counterparts of nearby dwarf galaxies could easily be the primary reionization sources and the early metal - polluters of the mw environment .",
    "our model predictions at @xmath22 are consistent with the sf histories of mw dwarf galaxies : ultra - faint dwarfs stop forming stars before the end of reionization @xcite , which does not affect the evolution of the more massive classical dsphs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the average sf rates predicted for @xmath0 dwarf galaxies are also within the observed range for the oldest stellar populations ( see fig .",
    "1b ) , implying that their photon / metal contribution has not been overestimated .",
    "independent of @xmath98 ( @xmath140 ) , and thus of the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath141 , we found that dwarf galaxies can produce @xmath3 of the ionizing photons required to fully ionize the mw environment , @xmath142 , in agreement with recent models and observations for cosmic reionization .",
    "as @xcite , we predict that reionization is initially driven by @xmath20 haloes , the progenitors of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies and the most common objects at @xmath143 .",
    "it is then completed by more massive dwarf galaxies , which are not affected by the radiative feedback processes that halt the sf in the smallest systems .",
    "the same @xmath0 dwarf galaxies that reionize the mw environment can also drive its early metal - enrichment via sn - driven outflows ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the metals ejected by dwarf galaxies can provide @xmath138 of the total mass of heavy elements in the mw environment at @xmath134 , when @xmath135 , and @xmath11 at @xmath144 .",
    "this implies that the high - z analogues of _ present - day _ dwarf galaxies could have dominated the metal - enrichment of the gaseous environments surrounding galaxies for @xmath87  gyr , thus suggesting possible links between the chemical abundances observed in their ancient stellar populations , and in the gas measured in distant qso absorption lines . for reasonable values of @xmath145 @xcite the reionization histories we found are compatible with our assumed evolution of the minimum mass for star - formation , @xmath28 , which is determined by radiative feedback . our fiducial model ( @xmath120 , @xmath99 ) , which predicts @xmath146 at @xmath147 and @xmath104 at @xmath7 , provides an electron scattering optical depth that is consistent with wmap / planck data , @xmath148 .",
    "assuming that all photons are absorbed by the mw environment ( mean free path @xmath149mpc ) , we find that at @xmath69 the intensity of uv radiation is @xmath150erg@xmath151s@xmath61hz@xmath61@xmath152sr@xmath61 .",
    "our findings for @xmath98 are consistent with @xcite , ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) who constrained @xmath153 to match the radial distribution and luminosity function of the mw satellites .",
    "thus , although our model can not make predictions for how many luminous galaxies survive merging , our inferred history of reionization is consistent with these additional constraints .    finally , we found that pop  iii stars are hosted by low - mass dwarf galaxies , and that they no longer form in the mw environment when @xmath154 .",
    "if the pop  iii imf is biased towards massive stars , then the uv emissivity will naturally increase at @xmath155 , as required by recent models for cosmic reionization .",
    "the massive nature of primordial stars has been overlooked recently because of the lack of a clear signature in the chemical abundances of _ very _ metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these new observational results , however , remain consistent with the predictions of our model for galactic halo stars , which are independent of the pop  iii imf ( ssf07 ) .",
    "thus , we can not exclude that pop  iii stars were massive , as also pointed out by recent simulations ( @xmath156 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in conclusion",
    ", low - mass dwarf galaxies hosting massive pop  iii stars could represent the hidden source of ionizing radiation that is missing at high-@xmath2 . hence their impact on mw environment",
