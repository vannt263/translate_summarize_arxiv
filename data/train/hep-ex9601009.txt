    "elastic photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons , @xmath71 , has previously been studied at photon - proton centre - of - mass energies up to @xmath72 gev in fixed target experiments  @xcite . at these energies",
    "the reaction @xmath71 has the characteristics of a soft diffractive process : a cross section rising weakly with the centre - of - mass energy , a steep forward diffractive peak in the @xmath11 distribution , where @xmath11 is the four - momentum transfer squared at the proton vertex , and @xmath12-channel helicity conservation .    at the energies of the previous experiments ,",
    "elastic vector meson photoproduction is well described as a soft diffractive process in the framework of the regge theory  @xcite and of the vector dominance model ( vdm )  @xcite . in this approach , this reaction is assumed to proceed at high energy through the exchange of a `` soft '' pomeron trajectory  @xcite with an effective intercept of @xmath73 and a slope of @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "recent experimental results  @xcite extend the validity of this approach to the high energies of hera for elastic @xmath76 photoproduction .",
    "this approach also provides predictions  @xcite for the total photoproduction cross section consistent with the measurements made at hera  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the predictions of regge theory fail to describe the recently measured rapidly rising cross sections at hera for elastic @xmath77 photoproduction  @xcite and for exclusive @xmath78 production ( @xmath79 ) in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "the measurements for the latter two processes are consistent with perturbative qcd calculations  @xcite . in these calculations",
    "the scale of the process is given by the virtuality @xmath80 of the exchanged photon for exclusive dis @xmath78 production or depends on the mass of the vector meson for elastic @xmath77 photoproduction .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations for the proton structure function @xmath81 are consistent with the data  @xcite at hera energies for a scale as small as @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "if the scale of elastic vector meson photoproduction is given by the mass of the vector meson , the scale of elastic @xmath0 photoproduction is between that of elastic @xmath78 and @xmath77 photoproduction and between that of elastic @xmath78 photoproduction and exclusive dis @xmath78 production .",
    "it is therefore of interest to measure elastic @xmath0 photoproduction and to see whether the scale of the process is large enough to cause a deviation from the behavior of a soft diffractive process .",
    "the expectations of regge theory and vdm may also be confronted by a measurement of elastic @xmath0 photoproduction at hera energies . in the additive quark model  @xcite and vdm",
    ", the reaction @xmath71 can proceed only by pomeron exchange  @xcite , and is thus a particularly clean example of a diffractive reaction .",
    "this paper reports a measurement with the zeus detector at hera of high energy production of @xmath0 mesons in the reaction @xmath84 using events with @xmath85 in which neither the scattered proton nor the scattered positron was observed in the detector .",
    "the @xmath0 was observed , via its decay into @xmath86 , in the kinematic range @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 @xmath83 , where @xmath89 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic diagram for the reaction @xmath90 where each quantity in parentheses is the four - momentum of the particle .",
    "the kinematics of the inclusive scattering of unpolarised positrons and protons is described by the positron - proton centre - of - mass energy and any two of the following variables :    * @xmath91 , the negative of the four - momentum squared of the exchanged photon ; * @xmath92 , the fraction of the positron energy transferred to the hadronic final state in the rest frame of the initial state proton ; * @xmath93 , the centre - of - mass energy squared of the photon - proton system , where @xmath94 is the proton mass .    for the description of the exclusive reaction @xmath95 ( @xmath2 )",
    "the following additional variables are required :    * @xmath96 , the four - momentum transfer squared at the proton vertex ; * the angle between the @xmath0 production plane and the positron scattering plane ; * the polar and azimuthal angles of the decay kaons in the @xmath0 rest frame .    in the present analysis , events were selected in which the final state positron was scattered at an angle too small to be detected in the main zeus calorimeter .",
    "thus the angle between the @xmath0 production plane and the positron scattering plane was not measured . in such untagged photoproduction events",
    "the @xmath80 value ranges from the kinematic minimum @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the electron mass , to the detector limit @xmath99 , with a median @xmath80 of approximately @xmath100 . because of this small @xmath80 value",

    "is obtained as the ratio of the corresponding @xmath122 cross section , integrated over the _",
    "y _ and @xmath80 ranges covered by the measurement , and the photon flux factor @xmath123 integrated over the same _ y _ and @xmath80 ranges .",
    "during 1994 hera operated with a proton beam energy of 820 gev and a positron beam energy of 27.5 gev . in the positron and",
    "the proton beams 153 colliding bunches were stored together with an additional 17 proton and 15 positron unpaired bunches .",
    "these additional bunches were used for background studies .",
    "the time between bunch crossings was 96 ns .",
    "the typical instantaneous luminosity was @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "a detailed description of the zeus detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the main components used in this analysis are outlined below .    charged particle   momenta   are   reconstructed   by the vertex detector ( vxd )  @xcite , the central tracking detector ( ctd )  @xcite and the rear tracking detector ( rtd )  @xcite .",
    "the vxd and the ctd are cylindrical drift chambers placed in a magnetic field of 1.43 t produced by a thin superconducting coil .",
    "the vertex detector surrounds the beam pipe and consists of 120 radial cells , each with 12 sense wires .",
    "the ctd surrounds the vertex detector and consists of 72 cylindrical layers , organized in 9 superlayers covering the polar angular region @xmath126 .",
    "the rtd is a planar drift chamber located at the rear of the ctd covering the polar angular region @xmath127 . using the information from the vxd , the ctd and the rtd for the two - track events of this analysis , the primary event vertex was reconstructed with a resolution of 1.4 cm in z and 0.2 cm in the transverse plane .",
    "the high resolution uranium - scintillator calorimeter cal  @xcite is divided into three parts , the forward calorimeter ( fcal ) , the barrel calorimeter ( bcal ) and the rear calorimeter ( rcal ) , which cover polar angles from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , @xmath129 to @xmath130 , and @xmath130 to @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "each part consists of towers which are longitudinally subdivided into electromagnetic ( emc ) and hadronic ( hac ) readout cells .",
    "the transverse sizes are typically @xmath132 @xmath133 for the emc cells ( @xmath134 @xmath133 in rcal ) and @xmath135 @xmath133 for the hac cells . from test beam data , energy resolutions with @xmath136 in gev of @xmath137 for electrons and @xmath138 for hadrons",
    "have been obtained .",
    "proton - gas events occuring upstream of the nominal @xmath111 interaction point are out of time with respect to the @xmath111 interactions and may thus be rejected by timing measurement made by the scintillation counter arrays veto wall , c5 and srtd respectively situated along the beam line at @xmath139 cm , @xmath140 cm and @xmath141 cm .",
    "the luminosity is determined  @xcite from the rate of the bethe - heitler process @xmath142 where the photon is measured by the lumi calorimeter located in the hera tunnel in the direction of the positron beam .",
    "zeus has a three level trigger system .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken with the `` untagged vector meson photoproduction trigger '' described in this section .",
    "the photoproduction events are `` untagged '' since the scattered positron escapes undetected through the beam pipe hole in the rcal .",
    "the first level trigger ( flt ) required :    * a minimum energy deposit of 464 mev in the electromagnetic section of the rcal , excluding the towers immediately surrounding the beam pipe ; * at least one track candidate in the ctd ; * less than 1250 mev deposited in the fcal towers surrounding the beam pipe . * the time of any energy deposited in the veto wall , the c5 and the srtd to be consistent with an @xmath111 interaction and not with a proton - gas event .",
    "the second level trigger ( slt ) rejected background events exploiting the excellent time resolution of the calorimeter .",
    "the third level trigger ( tlt ) used information from the ctd to select events with a reconstructed vertex , at most 4 reconstructed tracks and an invariant mass less than 1.5 gev for at least one two - track combination assuming that the particles are pions .",
    "the rate of the untagged vector meson photoproduction trigger leaving the tlt was about 2 hz . because of this high rate the trigger was prescaled .",
    "the recorded data collected during 1994 from this trigger correspond to an effective integrated luminosity of @xmath143 @xmath144 .",
    "the following offline cuts were applied to select the reaction @xmath145 :    * exactly two oppositely charged tracks associated with a reconstructed vertex ; * each track within the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath146}$ ] . ]",
    "range @xmath147 and with a transverse momentum greater than 150 mev .",
    "these cuts select the high efficiency and well understood region of the tracking detector ; * the z coordinate of the vertex within @xmath148 cm of the nominal interaction point ; * in bcal and rcal , not more than 200 mev in any emc ( hac ) calorimeter cell which is more than 30 cm ( 50 cm ) away from the extrapolated impact position of either of the two tracks .",
    "this cut rejects events with additional neutral particles ; * energy deposit in fcal less than 0.8 gev .",
    "this cut reduces the contamination from diffractive proton dissociation , @xmath149 .",
    "since the detector geometry and the trigger limit the observable kinematic range for the reaction @xmath71 , the selected events were restricted to the region : @xmath150 @xmath151 where the acceptance is well understood and the background contamination due to proton dissociation is relatively small .",
    "the acceptance for untagged elastic @xmath0 photoproduction was calculated by monte carlo methods .",
    "the reaction @xmath95 was simulated using two different event generators . the first one , dipsi , is based on a model by ryskin  @xcite .",
    "it describes elastic vector meson production by the exchange of a pomeron which interacts with the quark - antiquark pair into which the incoming virtual photon fluctuates .",
    "the second generator , jetphi , uses a vdm approach and was written in the framework of the jetset package  @xcite .",
    "events were generated in the @xmath152 range from 50 to 90 gev and the @xmath80 range between @xmath153 and 4 @xmath83 .",

    "the input vertex distribution was simulated in accordance with that measured using non - diffractive photoproduction events .",
    "the generated events were processed through the zeus detector and trigger simulation programs as well as through the analysis chain .",
    "the same offline cuts were used for the monte carlo events and for the data .",

    "the acceptance as a function of @xmath152 and @xmath157 is shown in fig .",
    "the acceptance drops at low values of @xmath152 because the decay kaons enter bcal , not rcal , thus providing no trigger . at high @xmath152 as well as at low @xmath158 values the acceptance decreases because the decay kaons emerge at a large polar angle and are not detected by the ctd .",
    "the acceptance as a function of @xmath159 , the invariant mass of the two decay kaons , is flat in the @xmath0 mass region .",
