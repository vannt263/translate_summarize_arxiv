    "@xcite have been black hole formation and the associated issues of gravitational collapse and the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "while there are numerous examples of initial conditions that form a naked singularity in the context of general relativity , none of them are generic as required by the terms of cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "however it has been proposed that three dimensions might be an exception @xcite",
    ". a recent study of collapsing _ shells _ in three dimensions with _ no _ angular momentum showed that a naked singularity and a cauchy horizon can form as the final result of shell collapse for a _ broad _ variety of initial data @xcite .",
    "this feature is quite generic since the results are independent of the types of collapsing shell matter such as pressureless dust , polytropic matter , and a generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) .",

    "the formation of a naked singularity is of great importance in association with the ads / cft correspondence @xcite since one might ask whether or not the quantum correlation function at the ads boundary is properly defined in the presence of a bulk singularity .",
    "this in turn raises additional issues associated with the collapse to a naked singularity , particularly the proper inclusion of quantum ( gravity ) effects in the bulk @xcite .",
    "thus far the possible scenarios for the emergence of a naked singularity have been explicitly analyzed for collapse to final states ( black holes or otherwise ) with no angular momentum @xcite . indeed , relatively little is explicitly known about the gravitational collapse of matter with nonzero angular momentum in any dimension .",
    "it is therefore natural to take into account an extension of gravitational collapse to exterior black holes with rotation ( or other possible configurations ) and to investigate how rotational effects alter previous results @xcite concerning cosmic censorship violation .",
    "while this problem is technically formidable in higher dimensions , a study of gravitational collapse of shells in three dimensions is considerably more tractable .",
    "so we shall consider this problem in our paper .    to this end , we introduce a co - rotating coordinate system on the shell , which simplifies the matching procedure .",
    "the angular momentum produces a potential barrier around the origin , preventing the shell from contracting to zero size .",
    "we analyze the possible collapse scenarios by investigating the effective potential for all types of equation of state . for a pressureless dust shell",
    ", we find that its angular momentum prevents the creation of a singularity at the origin , unlike the non - rotating case @xcite .",
    "previous work on rotating dust shell collapse was carried out in the hamiltonian formalism , an alternative to the darmois - israel formalism @xcite . for a more restricted class of scenarios",
    ", they found that singularities were also avoided .",
    "our work goes beyond this insofar as we consider shells with pressure . in this case ,",
    "curvature singularities of finite spatial extent are formed before they meet the barrier , and the effective potential and surface stress - energy tensor diverge . therefore under rather generic conditions it is possible for a naked singularity to form , violating cosmic censorship as in the non - rotating collapse scenario @xcite .",

    "violation of cosmic censorship occurs from the gravitational shell collapse , regardless of the rotation and initial data .",

    "these are the only scenarios ; the centrifugal barrier forbids a naked singularity from forming .",
    "however for shells with pressure we have another scenario in which a naked singular ring can form , violating cosmic censorship .",
    "when the exterior spacetime is taken to be a geometry with a point mass , one might expect that the collapsing shell could form a curvature singularity within finite time , since there is no event horizon as with the non - rotating system in ref .",
    "however we have shown that a naked singularity never forms in the collapse of a rotating dust shell due to a centrifugal barrier in the effective potential experienced by the shell .",
    "collapse scenarios for shells with pressure show that a naked ring singularity of finite size can be formed , where the effective potential and the surface stress - energy tensor diverge . for asymptotically ds boundary conditions a collapsing shell with pressure can form a naked singularity , also .",
    "if the interior spacetime is ( k)ds , then a cosmological horizon can form from an expanding shell . which of these scenarios occurs depends on the choice of parameters and initial conditions .    for asymptotically flat boundary conditions the qualitative behaviours are similar ,",
    "i.e. _ , a rotating collapsing dust shell does not form a naked singularity , but a shell with pressure can form a naked singularity . for a polytropic shell this will be a naked singular ring of finite size . the qualitative behaviour is more or less intermediate between the asymptotically ads and ds cases as implied by the choice of @xmath57 and illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : numpics2 ] and [ fig : numpics8 ] , though there are some anomalous regions that do not reveal this simple trend .",
    "the most intriguing lesson of this paper is that the centrifugal barrier in the effective potential governing the time evolution of a rotating dust shell can prevent formation of a naked singularity .",
    "however if the shell has pressure , a ring singularity may form for a typical class of equations of state , i.e. , @xmath321 , where the pressure dominates the angular momentum , with quite general initial data .",
    "so if the exterior spacetime is assumed to be a geometry without a ( covered ) black hole event horizon , then the singularity may be naked and the violation of cosmic censorship is possible .",
    "we have found that a collapsing shell can form either a black hole / cosmological horizon or a naked singularity or bounce to infinity , depending on the initial data .",
    "this suggests a set of phase transitions @xcite along with accompanying critical phenomena , similar to that discovered for scalar matter @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to study these phenomena explicitly as they could reveal universal features of the critical exponents in three dimensions .",
    "since we have confined our study to three dimensions ( where there is no gravitational radiation ) , some caution is warranted in applying our results to higher dimensions .",
    "we have found that the angular momentum does not in general prevent violation of cosmic censorship in three dimensions , where local gravitational interactions vanish outside of matter .",
    "an interesting extension of our work would be to include higher derivative terms , whose effect is to produce such interactions .",
    "another interesting extension is the inclusion of quantum effects , since they might be expected to prevent singularity formation , thereby sidestepping the cosmic censorship issue .",
