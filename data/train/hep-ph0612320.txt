    "recently , the study on the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is extended from finite temperature and baryon chemical potential to finite isospin chemical potential . the physical motivation to study pion superfluid formed at high isospin density",
    "is related to the investigation of neutron stars , isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy .",
    "different approaches , such as chiral perturbation theory@xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite , random matrix method@xcite , lattice qcd@xcite , ladder qcd@xcite and strong coupling lattice qcd@xcite , have been used to investigate the qcd phase structure at finite isospin density .",
    "it is found that there is a phase transition from the normal phase to the pion superfluid at a critical isospin chemical potential which is exactly the pion mass in the vacuum , @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature and chemical potential dependence of meson masses in the pion superfluid is calculated in the njl model@xcite , linear sigma model@xcite and @xmath1 theory@xcite .",
    "the familiar meson properties are significantly changed in the pion superfluid phase . in the normal phase which is controlled by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration , the scalar and pseudoscalar collective modes of a two flavor quark system are @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons . however , they are no longer the eigenmodes of the hamiltonian in the pion superfluid , and the new eigenmodes are the linear combination of them .",
    "it is the combination that guarantees the goldstone mode corresponding to the spontaneous isospin symmetry breaking@xcite .    to investigate the dynamic processes which may be considered as signatures of the pion superfluid",
    ", one needs not only the meson masses but also other in - medium meson properties in the superfluid . in this letter , we will study the hadron mixing and coupling constants for @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons at finite isospin density .",
    "it is well known that , the perturbation theory of qcd can well describe the new phases at extremely high temperature and high density , but the study on the phase structure at moderate temperature and density depends on lattice qcd calculation and effective models with qcd symmetries .",
    "one of the models that enables us to see directly how the dynamic mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration operate is the njl model@xcite applied to quarks@xcite .",
    "when the parameters in the model are properly chosen , the calculated chiral phase transition line@xcite in temperature and baryon chemical potential plane is very close to that obtained with lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "recently , this model is used to investigate color superconductivity@xcite at moderate baryon density and pion superfluidity@xcite at finite isospin density . we will study the meson mixing and coupling constants in the pion superfluid in the framework of this model .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we review the njl model in mean field approximation for quarks and random phase approximation ( rpa ) for mesons in the normal phase at finite isospin chemical potential . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we focus on the meson mixing and meson couplings to quarks in the pion superfluid .",
    "we summarize in section [ s4 ] .",
    "the mesons in the normal phase at finite isospin chemical potential are controlled by chiral dynamics and explicit isospin symmetry breaking . in this section",
    "we review the quark propagator in mean field approximation and meson polarizations in rpa in the njl model at finite temperature and baryon and isospin chemical potentials .",
    "the lagrangian density of the two flavor njl model at quark level is defined as@xcite @xmath4\\ ] ] with scalar and pseudoscalar interactions corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 excitations , where @xmath5 is the current quark mass , @xmath6 is the four - quark coupling constant with dimension ( gev)@xmath7 , @xmath8 are the pauli matrices in flavor space , and @xmath9 is the quark chemical potential matrix with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the @xmath12- and @xmath13-quark chemical potentials and @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the baryon and isospin chemical potentials .    at zero isospin",
    "chemical potential , the lagrangian density has the symmetry of @xmath16 corresponding to baryon number symmetry , isospin symmetry and chiral symmetry . at finite isospin chemical potential , the isospin symmetry @xmath17 and chiral symmetry @xmath18 are explicitly broken to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the chiral symmetry restoration at finite isospin chemical potential means only degeneracy of @xmath2 and @xmath21 mesons , the charged @xmath22 and @xmath23 behave still differently .    introducing the chiral and pion condensates",
    "@xmath24 with @xmath25 and taking all the condensates to be real , the quark propagator in mean field approximation can be expressed as a matrix in the flavor space @xmath26 with the four elements@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the energies of four quasi - particles with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and effective quark mass @xmath31 , and @xmath32/2 $ ] are the energy projectors .",
    "the quark propagator ( [ quarkpropagator ] ) is the background of our following calculations for quarks and mesons . from the definitions of the chiral and pion condensates ( [ condensate1 ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to express them in terms of the matrix elements of the quark propagator , @xmath33,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sigma_d = - \\sum_p tr\\left[i { \\cal s}_{dd}(p)\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\pi = \\sum_p tr \\left[\\left({\\cal s}_{ud}(p)+{\\cal s}_{du}(p)\\right)\\gamma_5\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace @xmath34 is taken in color and dirac spaces , and the four momentum integration is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 at finite temperature @xmath37 .",
    "note that , for @xmath38 or @xmath39 there is always @xmath40 , since in this case the chemical potential difference between @xmath41 and @xmath12 is the same as that between @xmath42 and @xmath13 .",
    "the coupled set of gap equations ( [ gap1 ] ) determines self - consistently the three condensates .",
    "the isospin chemical potential dependence of the effective quark mass @xmath43 and pion condensate @xmath3 is explicitly shown in @xcite .",
    "the phase transition from the normal phase to the pion superfluid is of second order .    in the njl model ,",
    "the meson modes are regarded as quantum fluctuations above the mean field . the two quark scattering via meson exchange can be effectively expressed at quark level in terms of quark bubble summation in rpa@xcite .",
    "the quark bubbles , namely the meson polarization functions are defined as@xcite @xmath44 with the trace @xmath45 taken in color , flavor and dirac spaces and the meson vertexes @xmath46 the explicit @xmath47 and @xmath15 dependence of the meson polarization functions ( [ polarization1 ] ) used in the following discussion can be found in appendix b of @xcite .    at @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the critical isospin chemical potential for the pion condensate ,",
    "the system is in the normal phase with diagonal quark propagator , and the bubble summation in the effective interaction in rpa selects its specific isospin channel by choosing at each stage the same proper polarization@xcite .",
    "therefore , the meson masses @xmath50 which are determined by poles of the meson propagators at @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related only to their own polarization functions@xcite , @xmath53 from the comparison of these mass equations with the gap equation for the pion condensate @xmath3 at @xmath54 but finite @xmath15 , the critical isospin chemical potential where the normal phase ends and the pion superfluid starts is exactly the pion mass in the vacuum@xcite , @xmath0 , and the @xmath15 dependence of the meson masses is simple@xcite , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses at @xmath59 . the isospin neutral mesons keep their vacuum masses , while the isospin charged mesons change their masses linearly .",
    "these relations hold until the pion condensate starts .    the meson couplings to quarks , @xmath60 ,",
    "are related to the residues at the corresponding poles of the meson propagators@xcite , @xmath61^{-1}|_{k_0=m_m}.\\ ] ]",
    "in the phase with finite pion condensate which leads to spontaneous isospin symmetry breaking , the quark propagator contains off - diagonal elements , we must consider all possible isospin channels in the bubble summation in rpa@xcite . while there is no mixing between @xmath21 and other mesons@xcite , @xmath62 ,",
    "the other three mesons are coupled together , and the effective interaction in two quark scattering via exchanging these mesons in rpa becomes a summation in the meson space , @xmath63 with the meson matrix @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the meson polarization matrix@xcite @xmath67 @xmath68 is its determinant , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 . in this case , @xmath72 and @xmath23 are no longer the eigenmodes of the hamiltonian , the new eigenmodes are linear combinations of them . in the following we call these new eigenmodes in the pion superfluid phase as @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath21 mass and coupling constant are still controlled by its own polarization function at @xmath52 , @xmath75^{-1}|_{k_0=m_{\\pi_0}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since it is independent of the other mesons . at @xmath54 ,",
    "the @xmath21 mass is exactly equal to the isospin chemical potential@xcite , @xmath76 . at the critical point @xmath0 , it is continuous with the solution @xmath77 in the normal phase .",
    "the masses of the new eigenmodes @xmath73 and @xmath74 are determined by the pole of the effective interaction at @xmath52 , @xmath78 it can be proven analytically that there is always a zero solution which guarantees the goldstone mode , @xmath79 , corresponding to the spontaneous isospin symmetry breaking@xcite .    in order to derive the coupling constants for the new modes ,",
    "we first expand the effective interaction @xmath80 around the meson mass @xmath81 at @xmath52 , @xmath82 and then make a transformation from the coupled meson space ( @xmath83 ) to the diagonalized meson space ( @xmath84 ) . with the help of the pole equation ( [ mass4 ] ) for the mass @xmath85 , we can derive the relations between the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath86 , @xmath87 where all the quantities are evaluated at @xmath88 . taking into account the symmetric property of @xmath86 , @xmath89 the effective interaction @xmath80 via changing a @xmath90-meson in the diagonalized meson space",
    "can be written as @xmath91 in terms of the new meson vertex @xmath92 where @xmath93 is defined as @xmath94 .",
    "since the meson coupling constant is defined as the residue of the effective interaction at the pole , we can extract the @xmath90-meson coupling constant @xmath95 from ( [ ueff3 ] ) , @xmath96    to explicitly describe the meson mixing in the pion superfluid phase , we can introduce mixing angles between two mesons , for instance , the angels @xmath97 between @xmath22 and @xmath2 , @xmath98 between @xmath23 and @xmath2 and @xmath99 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the @xmath100-meson channel , @xmath101 it is easy to see that only @xmath97 and @xmath98 are independent .",
    "the mixing angels in the @xmath102 and @xmath74 channels can be defined in a similar way .",
    "since the njl model is non - renormalizable , we can employ a hard three momentum cutoff @xmath103 to regularize the gap equations for quarks and pole equations for mesons . in the following numerical calculations , we take the current quark mass @xmath104 mev , the coupling constant @xmath105 gev@xmath7 and the cutoff @xmath106 mev@xcite .",
    "this group of parameters corresponds to the pion mass @xmath107 mev , the pion decay constant @xmath108 mev and the effective quark mass @xmath109 mev in the vacuum .",

    "the critical isospin chemical potential @xmath49 does not change with @xmath14 till @xmath111 which is determined by the comparison of the gap equation for the pion condensate at @xmath112 and @xmath113 with the pion mass equation in the vacuum . with increasing temperature , the critical value @xmath49 increases and the pion superfluid region decreases , due to the melting of pion condensate in hot mediums .     plane at fixed temperature @xmath37 .",

    "are the collective excitation modes of the system , and there is no mixing among them . in the pion superfluid phase with @xmath116 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 indicate the @xmath117 and @xmath118 mixing strengths in the @xmath100-meson channel , and @xmath99 reflects the relative strength between them . while in the very beginning of the superfluid",
    "any mixing is weak , it develops fast . for @xmath119 mev which corresponds to @xmath120 ,",
    "the mixing is already so strong that the contribution from @xmath22 to @xmath100 is larger than that from @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath23-component in @xmath100 becomes more important than the @xmath2-component itself even for @xmath121 mev .",
    "therefore , at not very high isospin chemical potential the @xmath23- and @xmath22-components start to dominate the @xmath100 mesons . while the @xmath118 mixing is always stronger than the @xmath122 mixing , namely @xmath123 , the relative strength shown by @xmath99 decreases with increasing isospin density .    at zero temperature , since the phase structure of the pion superfluid does not change till the baryon chemical potential @xmath124 mev , see the vertical straight line in fig.[fig1 ] , the mixing angles at finite baryon chemical potential @xmath125 mev are exactly the same as the ones shown in the upper panel of fig.[fig2 ] . since the pion superfluid happens only at low temperature , we calculated the @xmath15 dependence of the meson mixing angels at @xmath126 gev and @xmath127 gev , shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig2 ] . from the comparison with the upper panel , the shape of the mixing angles at finite temperature and",
    "baryon chemical potential is almost the same as that at @xmath54 , the only remarkable change is the critical value @xmath49 .",

    "the vertex for @xmath102 can be greatly simplified as @xmath130 at any temperature and baryon and isospin chemical potentials .",
    "the goldstone mode contains only @xmath22- and @xmath23-components , and the fractions for the two components are exactly the same .",

    ", the coupling constants are calculated through the diagonal polarization functions @xmath132 . at @xmath54",
    ", @xmath132 depends only on the quark mass @xmath43 , meson mass @xmath133 and isospin chemical potential @xmath15 . since @xmath133 for isospin neutral mesons @xmath2 and @xmath21 and @xmath43 are constants , the coupling constants @xmath134 and @xmath135 are @xmath15 independent . in the pion superfluid phase , the coupling constants , determined by the diagonal and off - diagonal polarization functions @xmath136 , behave very differently . from the mass relation @xmath137 at @xmath138 , the couplings @xmath139 and @xmath135 approach each other at large enough @xmath140 .",
    "note that @xmath141 is no longer a constant but changes slowly in the pion superfluid . since we did not consider the meson widths in the pole equation ( [ mass4 ] ) , the condition for a meson to decay into a @xmath142 and a @xmath143 is that its mass lies above the @xmath144 threshold .",
    "the meson masses , calculated through the pole equations ( [ mass1 ] ) in the normal phase and ( [ pi0 ] ) and ( [ mass4 ] ) in the pion superfluid , are shown in fig.15 of @xcite . in the pion superfluid ,",
    "the heaviest mode is @xmath100 and its mass is beyond the threshold value . as a result",
    ", there exists no @xmath100 meson , and the coupling constant @xmath145 drops down to zero at the critical point @xmath49 and keeps zero at @xmath116 . for the other three mesons @xmath146 and @xmath74 , their masses are below the threshold value , and the coupling constants are nonzero .    from fig.[fig2 ] , the meson mixing angels are only slightly changed by finite temperature @xmath37 and baryon chemical potential @xmath14 , when @xmath37 and @xmath14 are in a reasonable region .",

    "we have investigated the meson mixing and meson coupling constants in the njl model at finite isospin chemical potential . in the pion superfluid phase ,",
    "the normal mesons are no longer the collective excitation modes of the system , and the mixing among them becomes important . for the goldstone mode , it contains only charged pions and their fractions are exactly the same in the whole superfluid region . for the other new eigenmodes ,",
    "the meson mixing starts to control the system at @xmath148 mev which is only a little bit higher than the critical value @xmath149 mev at @xmath150 .",
    "the coupling constants for the conventional mesons in the normal phase and for the new eigenmodes in the pion superfluid phase behave very differently .",
    "the splitting of meson mass and coupling constant due to explicit and spontaneous isospin symmetry breaking can be used to further calculate the @xmath151 scattering and the number ratio @xmath152 in isospin asymmetric matter , which can help us to measure the meson properties at finite isospin density .",
