    "there is no similar lower bound when the yamabe constant is positive , and this is one explanation why the positive case is much more difficult to study . for instance one can use kobayashi s lower bound to prove that if @xmath5 is a closed @xmath18-manifold and @xmath24 is obtained by performing surgery on a sphere of dimension @xmath25 then @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "certain computations of the invariant can be deduced from this result , for instance in dimension 4 it implies that if @xmath27 then @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "but for the above reasons studying the behavior of the invariant under surgery in the positive case becomes much more difficult and it is still unknown if the surgery result holds as in the non - positive case .",
    "recently b. ammann , m. dahl and e. humbert @xcite proved that there is a positive constant @xmath29 , which depends only on @xmath18 and @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 .",

    "compares @xmath33 with @xmath34 , where @xmath14 is any smooth positive function in @xmath2 and @xmath35 is the spherical symmetrization of @xmath14 ( as explained below ) .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 norms of the functions is immediate and to compare the @xmath36-norms of the gradients one applies the coarea formula and the comparison of the isoperimetric profiles given by the levy - gromov isoperimetric inequality .",
    "the same type of argument works as soon as one has lower bounds for the isoperimetric profile and the scalar curvature of a metric @xmath10 , and this is the idea we will apply in this work",
    ".    we will denote by @xmath38 the isoperimetric profile of @xmath39 .",
    "namely , for any @xmath40 we consider all the regions in @xmath2 of volume @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be the infimum of the volumes of their boundaries . if a region @xmath43 realizes the infimum it is called an _ isoperimetric region _ and",
    "@xmath44 is called an _",
    "isoperimetric hypersurface_. for all manifolds appearing in this article",
    "isoperimetric regions are known to exit and their boundaries are smooth hypersurfaces .",
    "note that sometimes in the definition of the isoperimetric profile there is a normalization by the volume of the manifold , but since we will be interested in riemannian manifolds with infinite volume this is not possible .    in this article",
    "we will concentrate in obtaining a lower bound for the yamabe constant of @xmath0 .",
    "first we point out that for a non - compact manifold @xmath45 of positive scalar curvature we define its yamabe constant by    @xmath46    to apply the ideas mentioned above we need estimates for the isoperimetric profile .",
    "but the isoperimetric regions in @xmath47 are not known when @xmath48 .",
    "the isoperimetric profiles of the cylinders @xmath49 were described by by r. pedroza in @xcite . in section 2",
    "we will use his results and the ros product theorem in @xcite to prove the following comparison :    @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "given a non - negative smooth function @xmath52 we will build in section 3 symmetrizations @xmath53 which are nonincreasing radial function on the sphere @xmath54 and by using the previous theorem and the ideas mentioned above we will prove :    @xmath55 ) \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\epsilon}{3^{3/4 } } y(s^4 ) $ ] .",
    "note that    @xmath56    similar ideas can be applied to the products @xmath47 , for any @xmath30 and @xmath18 .",
    "but since some non - trivial numerical computation must be carried on it seemed better to focus in the particular case of @xmath0 .",
    "now , since for any riemannian metric @xmath10 on any 2-dimensional closed manifold @xmath2 it is proven in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) that    @xmath57 ) = y(s^2 \\times \\re^2 , [ g_0 + dx^2 ] ) , \\ ] ]    we obtain as a corollary that    if @xmath2 is a closed 2-dimensional manifold then @xmath58 .",
    "as far as we know this is the best result known about the yamabe invariants of @xmath59 when @xmath2 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 admits metrics of positive scalar curvature , and so it is known that @xmath62 $ ] . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that @xmath63 ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) for the explicit constant ) . but",
    "no other estimate is known to the best of the author s knowledge . in the case of @xmath64",
    "the product einstein metric , @xmath65 , is a yamabe metric ( since it is the only unit volume metric of constant scalar curvature in its conformal class by the classical theorem of m. obata @xcite ) . then one knows that @xmath66 ) = 16 \\pi \\approx 0.816 y(s^4 ) $ ] and it was proved by c. bhm , m. wang and w. ziller in @xcite that the inequality is strict .",
    "so in particular the last theorem does not give any new information for this case .",
    "we also point out that there are a few computations where the invariant falls into the interval @xmath67 , only in dimensions 3 and 4 . in dimension 3",
    "it was proved by h. bray and a. neves @xcite that the conformal class of the constant curvature metric on the projective space @xmath68 achieves the yamabe invariant and so @xmath69 and it was later shown by k. akutagawa and a. neves that this value is also the yamabe invariant of the connected sum of @xmath68 with any number of copies of @xmath70 @xcite . in dimension 4 c. lebrun proved that the conformal class of the fubini - study metric on @xmath71 realizes the yamabe invariant of @xmath71 and so @xmath72 and later m. gursky and c. lebrun showed that this is also the value of the yamabe invariant of the connected sum of @xmath71 with any number of copies of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem 1.1 .",
    "first we discuss a comparison between the isoperimetric profiles of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and between those of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath20 is the round metric for @xmath21 , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , ( where @xmath80 ) .",
    "we picked @xmath81 to match the maximums of the isoperimetric profiles @xmath82 and @xmath83 and we will prove in subsection 2.1 that @xmath84 . to obtain our lower bound on the yamabe constant of @xmath0",
    "we will need to compare the isoperimetric profile of @xmath0 with one of a 4-sphere @xmath85 .",
    "as we increase @xmath86 the scalar curvature decreases and this improves the lower bound .",
    "but the isoperimetric profile also increases and this makes our lower bound smaller .",
    "the value @xmath79 is the one for which one obtains the best lower bound for the yamabe constant .",
    "this should become clear in section 3 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath87 the round n - sphere of scalar curvature @xmath30 . note that according to this notation @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the isoperimetric profile for the spherical cylinder @xmath90 , @xmath48 , was recently studied by r. pedrosa @xcite .",
    "he shows that isoperimetric regions are either a cylindrical section or congruent to a ball type region and gives explicit formulae for the volumes and areas of the isoperimetric regions and their boundaries .",
    "the cylindrical section @xmath91 has volume @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , and its boundary has area @xmath94 .",
    "let us recall the values of @xmath95 that we will use : @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the ball type regions @xmath98 are balls whose boundary is a smooth sphere of constant mean curvature @xmath9 . the sections of @xmath98 , namely @xmath99 , are geodesic balls in @xmath21 centered at some fixed point .",
    "if we let @xmath100 be the maximum of the radius of those balls then @xmath101 . the formulas for the volumes of @xmath102 and its boundary obtained by pedroza are    @xmath103    @xmath104    where @xmath105    moreover , for @xmath106 , one obtains the formulas    @xmath107    @xmath108    with @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 is an increasing function of @xmath111 until it reaches the value @xmath112 .",
    "this value is achieved for @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "then for @xmath115 we have @xmath116 . and for any @xmath117 we have @xmath118 ( and the isoperimetric region is the corresponding spherical cylinder ) . as we mentioned before we picked @xmath119 so that the maximum of @xmath120 is @xmath121 .",
    "therefore to make the comparison of the isoperimetric profiles we only need to consider the @xmath122 regions and volumes @xmath123 .",
    "the isoperimetric regions in @xmath125 are geodesic balls , and we have the formula :    @xmath126    and as we mentioned above    @xmath127    these formulas are explicit and the only problem to prove the desired inequalities is that one can not find the inverse of the functions which give the volumes of the regions .",
    "nevertheless it is very easy ( and we hope this is clear to the reader ) to prove numerically the desired inequality for values of the volume away from 0 .",
    "the problem at 0 is that the isoperimetric profiles are very close and have a singularity at 0 ( the derivatives of the functions which give the volume vanish at 0 ) . since the scalar curvature of @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath128 it is know from a result of o. druet @xcite that the desired inequality holds for small values of the volume , but there is no lower bound for how small the volume has to be . we will prove explicitly that @xmath129 for @xmath130 by going through the numerical estimates .",
    "this is of course a very elementary and probably uninteresting job ; the reader might want to skip this part and go directly to the end of this subsection .    in order to prove the required inequality for small values of the volume we need to look at the taylor expansion of the formulas for the volumes of the isoperimetric regions and their boundaries .",
    "let @xmath131 and call @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "then we have ( by a explicit computation )    @xmath134    @xmath135    moreover , one can easily estimate that for @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 and therefore we have    @xmath139    and    @xmath140    the isoperimetric regions in @xmath141 are geodesic balls , and we have the formula :    @xmath126    then we let    @xmath142    and    @xmath143    we see    @xmath144    and @xmath145    now set @xmath146 . then    @xmath147    @xmath148 .",
    "moreover , one can easily check that for @xmath136 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "therefore we have    @xmath151    and    @xmath152    it follows that for @xmath136 we have    @xmath153 @xmath154 and    @xmath155",
    "@xmath156 @xmath157    now , for @xmath136 we have @xmath158 ( since @xmath159 is increasing ) . and so , we have that if @xmath136 then @xmath160 . since @xmath161 we have proved that @xmath162 for @xmath163 .",
    "once we dealt with sufficiently small values of the volume checking the desired inequality for the isoperimetric functions is a completely standard numerical argument . instead of going through it",
    ", we will simply provide with the graphics for @xmath164 ( figure [ fig : s2]a ) , for @xmath165 ( figure [ fig : s2]b ) and for @xmath166 ( figure [ fig : s2]c ) .",
    "the situation is similar to the one in the previous subsection .",
    "@xmath169 is isometric to @xmath170 .",
    "then we consider the formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and let @xmath171 .",
    "then if we call @xmath172 and @xmath173 it follows that @xmath174 for small values of @xmath175 .",
    "this holds until @xmath176 when @xmath177 .",
    "let @xmath178 .",
    "then for @xmath179 we have that @xmath180 . the only problem to verify the inequality is for small values of the volumes . in this case",
    "the problem becomes simpler because of the factor @xmath181 .    by a direct computation",
    "we see that @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "it follows that @xmath184 .",
    "but it was proved by v. bayle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 52 ) that the function @xmath185 is decreasing .",

    "then @xmath246 for @xmath228 and the lemma follows .",
    "we are now ready to give the proof of theorem 1.1 :    it follows from subsection 2.2 and lemma 2.1 that the theorem holds for @xmath247 . on the other hand ,",
