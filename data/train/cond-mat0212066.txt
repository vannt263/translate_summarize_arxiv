    "renormalization group methods have contributed in many ways to the understanding of the low energy properties of interacting fermion systems .",
    "early work using these methods focused on one - dimensional systems@xcite ; mathematical studies have been done for weakly coupled systems in one@xcite and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "general properties of interacting electrons were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the exact rg schemes were used to prove the existence of the landau - fermi liquid in two dimensions under certain conditions@xcite .    in the course of the last few years , the method has been applied to highly anisotropic two - dimensional models like the hubbard model on the square lattice and variants thereof@xcite without any crude simplifications of the dispersion relation and phase space .",
    "the approximate rg schemes used in these studies are derived from exact renormalization group equations@xcite that can be applied to wide variety of models and that allow a clearer view on the approximations necessary in practical calculations .    in these approximate studies in two dimensions ,",
    "the flow of the self energy has up to now mainly been neglected , with the exception of the following studies . for the @xmath2 hubbard model",
    "the fermi surface flow was included dynamically in the rg flow@xcite ( see the appendix of that paper ) .",
    "it was found that at a fixed density close to the van hove density , @xmath3 gets reduced in the flow .",
    "the quasiparticle scattering rate was estimated in the @xmath2 hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle weight was calculated for the special case of the half - filled band by zanchi@xcite .",
    "he found a substantial reduction of the weight at the saddle points @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the question of selfenergy effects in a wider context , to bring out the points relevant for this paper .",
    "the selfenergy shifts the fermi surface and it changes the fermi velocity and the quasiparticle weight , as well as the curvature of the fermi surface and the quasiparticle scattering rate .",
    "for weakly coupled systems with curved fermi surfaces and without van hove singularities , detailed phase space arguments were applied to prove that the curvature of the fermi surface develops no singularity , the quasiparticle weight remains close to one and the correction to the fermi velocity is small @xcite . in particular , this flow does not change the instabilities of the fermi liquid towards a superconducting state , which shows up as an initially marginal growth of the four  point function that leads to a divergence at a scale related to the critical temperature .",
    "moreover , the old question of continuity@xcite of the results of perturbation theory in the limit @xmath6 was solved : it was shown in ref .   that the problem of `` anomalous diagrams '' in ref",
    ".   arose only because of an insufficient renormalization procedure ( which amounts to the attempt of describing the shift of the fermi surface merely by a shift in the chemical potential ) .",
    "the deformation of the fermi surface was calculated by halboth and metzner in perturbation theory in the hubbard model@xcite ; they found that there is a density @xmath7 , below which the fermi surface tends to become rounder and above which it tends to become more squarelike .",
    "we note that this density value can be understood geometrically as the smallest one where umklapp processes first contribute to the two  loop selfenergy ; at this density the singularity analysis of ref .",
    "changes as well .",
    "recently it was pointed out that a fermi surface close to the van hove points is in principle unstable towards a spontaneous breaking of the fourfold symmetry@xcite .    a curved fermi surface away from the critical points of the dispersion relation is a necessary condition for fermi liquid behavior . in presence of van hove singularities and in situations with small curvature , such as very close to half",
    " filling at @xmath8 and in quasi",
    " one  dimensional systems , the selfenergy can be expected to be relevant .",
    "the prototypical case of a perfectly flat fermi surface is ( apart from half  filling in two dimensions , where the situation is further complicated by the presence of van hove singularities ) the one  dimensional fermion system .",
    "simple descriptions of the flow towards the luttinger liquid within the wilsonian rg concept have been given for example by metzner et al .",
    "@xcite or the recent comprehensive review by bourbonnais@xcite . a mathematical proof that the flow of the quasiparticle weight leads to the luttinger exponents was given by benfatto et al.@xcite .",
    "recently busche et al.@xcite rederived the flow of the quasiparticle weight @xmath9 in the 1d luttinger model and even obtained the spectral function of the luttinger fixed point .",
    "thus the functional rg schemes give a detailed description of luttinger liquid physics .",
    "one important advantage of this method is that it neither requires exact scaling laws nor relies on the peculiarities of one spatial dimension , and that it applies to a wide class of model hamiltonians .    from the rg point of view , the existence of the luttinger liquid fixed point hinges on the cancellations to all orders between the particle ",
    "hole terms at @xmath10 and the particle  particle terms at @xmath11 .",
    "this cancellation is there already in lowest order , where the wave function renormalization still does not enter .",
    "it is a one  dimensional phenomenon : in higher dimensions , it is absent , and the interactions almost always flow to strong coupling , i.e.  diverge at a positive energy scale . already before this point ,",
    "the rg flow in the fermionic variables breaks down .",
    "this signals the possible opening of a gap in the fermionic excitation spectrum , the simplest case being superconductivity .",
    "a key question is if the selfenergy effects , when fed back into the flow equations of the four  point interaction , can remove such instabilities altogether . in particular , a strong suppression of the quasiparticle weight might prevent a flow to strong coupling , and thus instabilities with ordering tendencies , at all . for curved fermi surfaces , this has proved not to be the case @xcite , but the situation is less simple for quasi-1d systems@xcite and models with van hove singularities on the fermi surface@xcite .    in the present article",
    "we address this question using the numerical @xmath0patch implementation of the rg scheme for the 1pi functions@xcite .",
    "we incorporate the second order flow of the selfenergy in a way similar to the one  dimensional study by busche et al.@xcite , but we also include the flow of the renormalized interactions , which is relevant in more than one dimension .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "our calculation correctly reproduces the suppression of the quasiparticle weight and the exponent of the luttinger model in the one  dimensional hubbard model . in quasi1d systems with curved",
    "fermi surfaces the flow to strong coupling remains almost unaffected by renormalization of the quasiparticle weight , in the parameter regime we study .",
    "the same holds for the fully two  dimensional system : the suppression of the quasiparticle weight does not prevent the flow to strong coupling .",
    "this implies that the @xmath1-wave superconductivity found in the weakly repulsive hubbard model@xcite close to half filling is not destroyed by the inclusion of these selfenergy effects .",
    "another piece of information that is provided by our scheme is the anisotropy of the quasiparticle weight around the fermi surface . at temperatures above the flow to strong coupling",
    "this information can be used for a fermi liquid description of the normal state .",
    "our finding is that in the simple hubbard model the quasiparticle weight varies only mildly around the fermi surface and no anomalous effects should be expected based on that .",
    "the renormalization group equations for the 1-particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertex function have been described in several works@xcite . the basic input for these equations is to assume that the quadratic part of the original action depends continuously on a certain parameter , here called @xmath12 .",
    "the rg equations then describe the evolution of the vertex functions of the system when this parameter is varied . in most applications @xmath12 is taken to be an infrared energy cutoff ( or , similarly , momentum shells are integrated out ) ; under certain conditions however it may be appropriate to use the physical temperature@xcite .",
    "although the latter choice is intuitively appealing and preferable when investigating if ferromagnetic instabilities occur@xcite , we will use here the conventional ir cutoff scheme , because it is simpler and requires less numerical effort in the @xmath0-patch implementation , and because here we shall only study parameter regions where ferromagnetism was found to be absent@xcite .    in the ir cutoff rg the quadratic part @xmath13 of the action , in our case @xmath14 ,",
    "is supplemented with a cutoff function @xmath15 , @xmath16 we take @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a fixed smooth function that increases from @xmath11 to @xmath19 in a small interval of length @xmath20 around @xmath21 .",
    "later we shall take the limit @xmath22 , which gives a step function cutoff .",
    "the function @xmath23 and the stepfunction limit are discussed in the appendix .",
    "thus @xmath24 is unity for band energy @xmath25 but gets very large for @xmath26 , thus strongly suppressing low energies and effectively restricting the integration over the fermionic modes to those above @xmath12 . taking the derivative with respect to @xmath12",
    "one obtains a functional rg equation for the generating functional of the connected correlation functions and its legendre transformation , the effective action .",
    "an expansion in the fields yields an hierarchy of coupled differential equations for the 1pi @xmath27point vertex functions .",
    "the hierarchy is infinite because the derivative of the @xmath27-point vertex depends on the @xmath28point vertex .",
    "we truncate the hierarchy by setting the 1pi 6point function equal to zero , and are left with the two equations presented graphically in fig .",
    "[ oneloopeqs ] .",
    "the first equation determines the flow of the self energy @xmath29 and the second that of the two  particle interaction , i.e.  the four - point vertex . the barred internal line in fig .",
    "[ oneloopeqs ] denotes a single scale propagator @xmath30 while the internal line without bar stands for the interacting one - particle green function at the given scale , @xmath31 in this paper we consider the limit of a sharp cutoff , @xmath32 .",
    "we discuss in the appendix how this limit is taken ; the result is @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "when inserting these expressions in the flow equations , undefined quantities like @xmath36 can appear at special values of the shift momentum @xmath37 ( e.g.  at @xmath38 ) .",
    "the sharp cutoff limit of all such terms is , however , well  defined and unique .",
    "we discuss in some detail in the appendix the limiting rule for avoiding these ( seeming ) ambiguities .    by spin rotation symmetry , the coupling function is @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 fixed by momentum conservation in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) . here",
    "@xmath43 includes frequency and spatial momentum .    in terms of an expansion in the bare coupling function , the above ",
    "mentioned truncation is exact up to second order .",
    "however , the rg provides more than just a second  order calculation : the evolution of the interaction and the selfenergy is continually fed back into the rg differential equation .",
    "this effectively sums up contributions from arbitrarily high order and thus produces a scale  dependent resummation of perturbation theory .",
    "we note that the above  mentioned truncation does not correspond to an expansion to a fixed loop order : the flow equations appear to be one  loop , but they also take into account two  loop effects by iteration .",
    "since we are not doing a semiclassical expansion in orders of @xmath44 , this is not a problem by itself .",
    "the relevant question is when higher orders significantly change the flow .",
    "they certainly do so when the coupling functions get too large ; a detailed discussion of what `` large '' means is given in ref .  .    by power - counting arguments ,",
    "the leading part of the flow is given by the interaction processes between particles close to the fermi surface , that is , with frequency close to zero and spatial momenta on the fermi surface .",
    "thus we drop the frequency dependence of the four - point vertex , so that @xmath45 , and calculate @xmath46 with wavevectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 on the fermi surface .",
    "we discretize the remaining angular dependence by introducing patches around @xmath0 wavevectors on the fermi surface and approximate the coupling function by its @xmath49 values at the patch wavevectors .",
    "this device of angular patches ( or `` sectors '' ) has been used in various works .",
    "it is the basic method for mathematical studies of 2d fermion systems , where @xmath0 is chosen as @xmath50 at scale @xmath12 , i.e.  it increases at low energies , as one approaches the fermi surface .",
    "the strong constraints implied by momentum and energy conservation in two dimensions then yield an intrinsic @xmath51 expansion@xcite . as a concrete calculational tool this @xmath0-patch technique",
    "was first used by zanchi and schulz@xcite and then in a number of subsequent works@xcite .",
    "the projection to the fermi surface suffices to obtain the leading coupling function flow but it would be incorrect to assume that the full 1pi four  point function is well approximated by the projection to the fermi surface . to obtain observables , one has to study the flow of response functions@xcite , or , more generally , the flow of functions with general external momenta .        .",
    "the spin indices belonging to wavevectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) are the same . ]    the quasiparticle residue that we want to calculate is determined by the frequency dependence of the selfenergy . because we do not use a cutoff in the frequencies , we would in principle have to calculate the self energy over the whole frequency axis .",
    "however , the singularity of the propagator is at zero frequency , so the behavior of the selfenergy near to zero frequency is the most important .",
    "we calculate the frequency derivative at zero imaginary frequency and at the fermi surface as @xmath56 where the denominator is the difference between the two smallest matsubara frequencies @xmath57 ( here @xmath58 denotes the projection of @xmath59 to the fermi surface ) .",
    "we then determine the quasiparticle weight as @xmath60^{-1 }   .\\ ] ] and write @xmath61 the above involves a number of approximations .",
    "as already discussed , we have approximated the quasiparticle weight for a particle at band energy @xmath62 by the quasiparticle weight on the fermi surface at the rg scale @xmath63 .",
    "this effectively reduces the total weight to @xmath64 because high frequency modes also get this weight .",
    "since we are interested in the low energy properties , this plays no important role .",
    "we have also neglected the fermi surface shift @xmath65 . moreover , in writing ( [ zpropagators ] ) , we have assumed that the correction to the @xmath59dependence of the dispersion relation ( involving @xmath66 ) is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath64 so that we can effectively write @xmath67 in the denominator once we have put @xmath64 in the numerator of the propagators .",
    "this is correct in the one  dimensional case because there , the dependence on @xmath68 and on @xmath69 is similar ; in 2d it is a further assumption .",
    "an investigation of this assumption is underway , as well as a more detailed calculation of the fermi surface shift extending that of ref .  .",
    "the quasiparticle scattering rate in the 2d case was considered in ref . and turned out to be reasonably small until the couplings exceed the perturbative range .    as indicated above",
    ", the frequency dependence of the four  point vertex can be dropped in determining the leading part of the flow , but not from the full four  point function .",
    "in particular , it is obvious from the form of the equation for the selfenergy that the external momentum does not enter the internal line , hence the frequency dependence of the selfenergy must come from a frequency dependence of the four  point function .",
    "again we employ an approximation that is exact to second order  like in ref . we reinsert the integrated form of the equation for the four  point function in the selfenergy equation .",
    "this gives a two  loop diagram , in which we now again approximate the two appearing full four  point functions @xmath70 by coupling functions @xmath71 .",
    "the right hand side of the differential equation for the selfenergy is now nonlocal in @xmath12 : the change of four - point vertex and selfenergy at scale @xmath12 involves four - point vertices and selfenergies at scales @xmath72 . in the next section",
    "we will compare this nonlocal equation with its local approximation where four - point vertex and self - energy at scale @xmath73 are approximated with the ones at @xmath12 .",
    "this iteration of the solution of the rgde is a general method that can also be applied to the full system of equations : setting the 1pi @xmath74point function equal to zero means restricting the @xmath74point function to tree diagrams in the bare interaction .",
    "if the bare interaction is a four  point interaction , these trees are of order @xmath75 in the four  point coupling .",
    "the resulting truncated system of equations can be solved by iterative substitution as above .",
    "thus the truncation of setting the 1pi @xmath74point function equal to zero is exact to order @xmath76 in the coupling , and indeed we will reproduce the luttinger liquid exponents to second order in our calculation . by the same method one can get higher order corrections to the luttinger exponents if one truncates at a higher @xmath27 .",
    "we note that this method to reconstruct higher - loop contributions to the selfenergy is less approximate than the scheme used in ref . .",
    "the latter assumes that the forward scattering occurring in the one - loop diagrams for the selfenergy can be decomposed in parts that only depend on the total momentum or the momentum transfer ( which may be less accurate for anisotropic systems ) and interchanges scale and frequency dependences of the scattering vertex in a non - generic way .",
    "the reconstruction of the two - loop contributions as described above renders these approximations unnecessary .",
    "there are two distinct one - loop diagrams for the flow of the self energy ( the hartree and the fock diagram ) and 5 one - loop diagrams ( one particle - particle and four particle - hole diagrams ) for the coupling function ( see figures 4 and 5 in ref .  ) .",
    "therefore we get ten diagrams from inserting the flow of the coupling function into the two one - loop diagrams for @xmath77 , shown in fig .",
    "[ twoloopdias ] .",
    "four of these diagrams are of one - loop@xmath78tadpole - type , hence frequency - independent in our approximation and thus do not contribute to @xmath64 .",
    "thus we are left with six two - loop diagrams for @xmath79 .",
    "one - loop contributions or real two - loop terms .",
    "we only keep the logarithmically divergent two - loop diagrams .",
    "one internal line is at scale @xmath12 , indicated by the bar in fig .",
    "[ twoloopdias ] , and one of the other two lines corresponds to a single - scale propagator at scale @xmath73 that is being integrated over .",
    "the third line is an interacting green function with support on modes above @xmath73 . ]    in condensed notation the rg equations for the selfenergy are @xmath80 here the star stands for the momentum integration and matsubara frequency summation according to the standard diagrammatic rules ( for details , see refs .  ) .",
    "similarly , the equation for the coupling function reads @xmath81 in the following we consider the renormalized vertex and coupling function @xmath82^{1/2 }   \\gamma^{(4)}_{\\lambda , s_1s_2s_3s_4 } ( \\vec{k}_1,\\vec{k}_2,\\vec{k}_3,\\vec{k}_4 )   \\label{gammaren } \\\\   { { \\tilde{v}}}_\\lambda ( \\vec{k}_1,\\vec{k}_2,\\vec{k}_3 )   & = &   \\left [   z_\\lambda ( \\vec{k}_{1 } ) z_\\lambda ( \\vec{k}_{2 } ) z_\\lambda ( \\vec{k}_{3 } ) z_\\lambda ( \\vec{k}_{4 } ) \\right]^{1/2 } \\ ,   v_\\lambda(\\vec{k}_1,\\vec{k}_2,\\vec{k}_3 )   \\label{renv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they describe the interaction between the quasiparticles with renormalized amplitude @xmath64 at the corresponding energy scale . if the limit @xmath83 can be taken and @xmath64 remains nonzero , the quasiparticle scattering amplitudes of the emergent landau fermi liquid can be read off eq .",
    "( [ renv ] ) .",
    "the flow equations can now be expressed in terms of @xmath84 and @xmath64 and the @xmath85 defined in ( [ zpropagators ] ) as @xmath86 ( here the dot denotes @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 in an expansion in terms of the bare coupling function , the last term on the right hand side of ( [ rengflo ] ) is of third order . in the luttinger model , this term cancels exactly against the third order contribution to the coupling function flow@xcite .",
    "because of the cancellation between the particle  hole and particle  particle terms in the first term , the coupling in the luttinger model does not flow in this approximation , as it must be . in higher dimensions we also have to drop this term to remain consistent to second order .",
    "keeping this term would require also taking into account the higher orders in the flow of the coupling function , that is , truncating only at @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , in the following we drop the second term in ( [ rengflo ] ) . as just discussed , this is consistent both in 1d and in higher dimension and thus allows us to compare the flow in the luttinger model with that in weakly and fully two  dimensional situations .",
    "an important feature of the equations is that the @xmath9 factors do not appear in the equation for the renormalized four point vertex any more , so that the flow of the renormalized four point function is the same as that of the ( unrenormalized ) four point function when the @xmath9 factor is dropped altogether .",
    "therefore a small @xmath9 factor can only prevent a flow to strong coupling through ( [ gammaren ] ) .",
    "one conclusion of this work will be that - in contrast with the 1d case - in the 2d system the suppression of the quasiparticle weight is weak as long as the coupling function remains in the perturbative range .",
    "the full two - loop flow of the coupling function is left for future work , but the value of @xmath9 obtained from our calculation will already give us a first estimate of the size of these two  loop terms .    as discussed above , @xmath84 is now replaced by the integrated equation ( [ rengflo ] ) , with @xmath90 replacing @xmath84 on the right hand side , in ( [ zflo ] ) .",
    "we can now solve for @xmath9 in the one  dimensional case . if @xmath90 is independent of scale and has initial value @xmath91 , eq .",
    "( [ zflo ] ) reads ( in the local approximation described above ) @xmath92 with @xmath93 the value of the two  loop contribution and @xmath91 the coupling constant .",
    "this integrates to the power law @xmath94 it follows that the two  point function has an anomalous decay exponent given by @xmath95 .",
    "this argument also shows that it is not necessary to include a rescaling of the momenta in the rg transformation to obtain anomalous dimensions , contrary to some claims@xcite .    in higher dimensions and for curved fermi surfaces",
    ", the overlapping loop effect@xcite implies that the two  loop integral is small , so that ( [ zflo ] ) reads @xmath96 the solution of which remains close to one for all @xmath97 if @xmath91 is small .",
    "however , in that case , the coupling function is not constant because of the cooper instability , so that eventually @xmath9 would also differ significantly from @xmath19 . on the other hand , to get a bound we only need to replace @xmath98 by the maximal value of the @xmath12dependent coupling function in ( [ zdge2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath9 does not differ much from @xmath19 before the couplings get of order @xmath99 , which is outside of the range where the one  loop coupling flow is justified@xcite .",
    "so @xmath9 plays no important role in the flow .",
    "moreover , when restricting to temperatures above the critical temperature for superconductivity , the couplings remain small if they started out small , and the @xmath9 factor remains close to @xmath19 : the system is a weakly coupled fermi liquid @xcite .    when the fermi surface contains van hove points or flat parts , the @xmath9 factor can , however , get strongly suppressed .",
    "we investigate this in sec .  v.",
    "in this section we apply our formalism to the one - dimensional hubbard chain .",
    "we have already seen that when the couplings do not flow , the @xmath9 factor obeys a power law , so that our approximation does describe the luttinger exponents .",
    "thus the numerical calculations in this section serve mainly as a check for the numerical implementation but they also gives some insight on the magnitude of band structure effects .",
    "the tight binding dispersion along the chain is given by @xmath100 where the chemical potential @xmath101 determines the particle number .",
    "in the usual @xmath102-ology terminology@xcite one considers four coupling constants @xmath103 with two incoming and one outgoing quasiparticle on the fermi surface . for the hubbard interaction @xmath104 at the initial stage of the rg procedure",
    "they all have the same value @xmath105 .",
    "first let us consider the case away from half filling . in this case",
    "the one - loop flow of the interactions does not lead to strong coupling .",
    "the coupling @xmath106 involves scattering into states away from the fermi surface and does not influence the low energy physics .",
    "@xmath107 does not couple to any logarithmically diverging channel and does not flow in the usual rg schemes .",
    "@xmath108 is irrelevant and is driven to zero towards lower scales .",
    "@xmath109 is somewhat reduced as the difference @xmath110 is a constant in the one - loop flow .",
    "the simplest model completely neglects the flow of @xmath109 and sets @xmath111 .",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , and in accordance with refs . and , in the local approximation ( described in the previous section ) to the rg equations the quasiparticle weight is suppressed like @xmath112 if we allow the coupling constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 to flow , this gets modified@xcite to @xmath113    \\ , .\\ ] ]    -local approximation to the rg equations , while the thick solid lines are without the local approximation .",
    "the thick dashed - dotted line is for @xmath114 .",

    "[ lumo ] we compare these expressions with our numerical rg scheme . if we choose the same local approximation the agreement is excellent down to scales @xmath117 ( we start the flow at @xmath118 ) .",
    "we also observe some deviations in the initial flow due to the non - linearity of the dispersion relation .",
    "below @xmath119 these deviations are negligible and could be absorbed in the powerlaws ( [ g2z ] ) and ( [ g1g2z ] ) by simple prefactors . the rg equations that are nonlocal in the scale yield lead to quantitative corrections . if we neglect the flow of the coupling function ( left plot in fig .",
    "[ lumo ] ) , the non - local corrections slightly weaken the luttinger exponent . in the case where the coupling function is allowed to flow ( right plot ) , the non - local corrections suppress the @xmath9 factors further because the couplings @xmath108 and @xmath109 are decreasing functions of the rg scale .",
    "nonzero temperature @xmath120 causes the expected saturation of the flow of @xmath9 at scales @xmath121 .",
    "note that in our case , where @xmath116 , corresponding to @xmath122 , and the initial scale @xmath123 , the suppression of @xmath9 is relatively weak .",
    "next let us consider the case of nonzero hopping @xmath124 between hubbard chains .",
    "this leads to the dispersion relation @xmath125 the curvature of the fermi surface ( see fig . [ tp2plot ] ) induced by @xmath126 prevents the cancellation of the one - loop flow of the interaction and cuts off the divergence of the self energy derivatives .",
    "phase space considerations indicate that above this cutoff scale @xmath127 set by the curvature the system will resemble a one - dimensional system , while below @xmath127 it will behave like a two - dimensional fermi liquid and maybe undergo a flow to strong coupling .",
    "analytic expressions for the quasiparticle weight in coupled chains and the crossover from 1d to 2d behavior can be found in the review by bourbonnais@xcite .",
    "they are based on a random phase approximation for the interchain motion and state that @xmath128 where the second factor describes the effective decrease of the interchain hopping by the renormalization of the quasiparticles on the chains .",
    "@xmath129 is the exponent that describes the decay of @xmath64 on a single chain . in our case @xmath130 .",

    "the repulsive scattering processes are largest between the almost nested flat sides of the fermi surface ( see arrow in left plot ) .",

    "the minimal quasiparticle weight at @xmath133 is 0.89 . ]    in absence of interchain hopping and umklapp scattering , the one - loop flow of the coupling constants does not lead to strong coupling because the cooper diagrams cancel the @xmath10-particle - hole diagrams that would otherwise lead to a nesting instability .",
    "this delicate balance gets destroyed by nonzero @xmath126 as particle - particle and particle - hole diagrams depend on the transverse wavevector in a different way .",
    "partial nesting between almost parallel parts of the fermi surface generates a growth of some coupling constants ( see fig .",
    "[ g20tp03 ] ) .",
    "interactions between different layers of coupled chains can in principle induce spin density wave ordering with the corresponding wavevectors at finite temperature . with increasing @xmath134 and larger",
    "the fermi surface becomes more and more rounded and sufficiently away from half filling the nesting features get washed out .",
    "the specific question we are interested in is whether the flow of the quasiparticle weight becomes significant in the scale range where these nesting features develop .",
    "this is important as many studies of potential instabilities in quasi-1d materials neglect possible selfenergy effects .",

    "therefore , at least for the parameters considered here , the flow of the quasiparticle weight does not qualitatively alter the conclusions drawn from the one - loop flow of the coupling function .",

    "the flow of the renormalized coupling function is unmodified compared to the earlier studies neglecting the flow of the quasiparticle weight . here",
    "we focus on the case @xmath8 and on the flow of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "we want to analyze a ) how strong the suppression of the quasiparticle weight is and whether these two - loop effects get comparable to the one - loop terms that drive the coupling function ; b ) whether the @xmath9-factor develops a distinctive anisotropy around the fermi surface , e.g. at higher temperature , when the flow of the coupling function remains finite .",
    "first let us describe the @xmath0-patch results shown in fig .",
    "[ g32mu0 ] for half filling and in fig .",
    "[ w32mu23 ] for electron density @xmath142 per site .",
    "we observe that the quasiparticle weight gets increasingly suppressed toward low scales where the coupling functions get large .",
    "the suppression is strongest close to the van hove points .",
    "thus the flow is consistent with a vanishing quasiparticle weight at low energies at least in the saddle point regions .",
    "nevertheless we note that even if we follow the growth of the renormalized coupling function far out of the perturbative range , the suppression of @xmath9 remains rather weak .",
    "this shows that the two - loop effects diminishing the quasiparticle weight are small compared to the one - loop contributions driving the coupling function and that the one - loop approximation@xcite for the latter may be justified in this scale range .",
    "a similar picture is found away from half filling . in fig .",
    "[ w32mu23 ] we show data for @xmath143 and initial @xmath144 . at low temperatures the flow goes towards a @xmath1-wave superconducting instability .",
    "the quasiparticle weight gets somewhat suppressed towards the instability , but the renormalized coupling constants flow off to strong coupling . although the flow of the @xmath9-factors is driven by the interactions , it still continues an approximately logarithmic decrease while the interactions seem to diverge with some power - law .",
    "this indicates that at these scales the two - loop contributions are much weaker than the one - loop terms that drive the flow to strong coupling . at higher temperatures ,",
    "@xmath145 the coupling function does not diverge , and we can follow the flow to lowest scales . the flow of the quasiparticle weight gets cut off at scales @xmath146 and remains close to unity over the full fermi surface .",
    "like in the quasi-1d cases studied in the last section the suppression of @xmath9 is only mildly anisotropic .",
    "next we interpret these findings and put them into context with other works in the literature .",
    "the flow of the quasiparticle weight close to the saddle points was studied by dzyaloshinski@xcite for @xmath147 in a system restricted to the saddle point regions , and more recently by zanchi@xcite for the half - filled case using a @xmath0-patch formalism related to ours .",
    "dzyaloshinski@xcite neglected the logarithmically divergent particle - hole diagrams with respect to the logarithm - squared particle - particle diagrams .",
    "consequently in the repulsive hubbard model his flow does not lead to strong coupling .",
    "nonetheless the quasiparticle weight approaches zero at low scales , similar to the luttinger liquid case .",
    "however , at least for our choice of parameters , the particle - hole diagrams always drive the flow to strong coupling , even if the nesting is weaker .",
    "zanchi@xcite argued that for the half - filled case and @xmath8 the quasiparticle weight approaches zero at the saddle points at scales above the divergence scales of any susceptibilities , indicative of an anomalous normal state without long range order .",
    "the suppression of the quasiparticle weight is in qualitative agreement with our results .",
    "however we note that in the perturbative range , where the approach is valid , the suppression of @xmath9 is only weak . therefore in our opinion",
    "no strong conclusions regarding the order of closely competing poles in the flow of @xmath9 and various susceptibilities can be drawn . in view of the weakness of the two - loop effects it appears to be more likely that for the half - filled perfectly nested case the barely attenuated growth of the coupling function leads to spin - density wave ( sdw ) order in the ground state where quasiparticles exist only above the sdw energy gap or at temperatures above the instability .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that at temperatures above the runaway flow of the interactions ( see thin lines in fig .",
    "[ g32mu0 ] ) the flow of the quasiparticle weight saturates at low scales and remains nonzero .",
    "thus , although we can not rule out the possibility , we do not find any evidence for a non - fermi liquid or luttinger - liquid like state at temperatures above the flow to strong coupling .",
    "a similar expectation regarding the one - particle spectrum holds for densities less than half filling : the growth of the renormalized coupling function out of the perturbative range indicates the opening of a gap at least on parts of the fermi surface . in the case @xmath142 per site we expect superconducting long range order of @xmath148-symmetry . in our approximation the flow of the interactions is unchanged by the flow of the quasiparticle weight and develops a strongly dominant diverging pair scattering in the @xmath148-channel as discussed by several authors@xcite . the weak suppression of the quasiparticle weight down to scales where the pair scattering is already much larger than the bandwidth shows the irrelevance of two - loop effects .",
    "thus our results affirm the evidence for @xmath1-wave superconductivity in the hubbard model at weak to moderate @xmath91 .",
    "note however that there are examples of one - dimensional systems where a one - loop flow to strong coupling does not lead to a ( quasi-)long - range ordered ground state . in the half",
    "filled two - leg hubbard ladder @xcite the single particle spectrum is fully gapped , yet all spin- and charge correlation functions remain exponentially decaying .",
    "we pointed out@xcite that in the 2d hubbard model for nonzero @xmath3 the flow to strong coupling strongly resembles the one in the two - leg ladder and that this may indicate a novel strong coupling state for a certain parameter range of the 2d hubbard model different from the @xmath8 case studied above .",

    "the @xmath0-patch renormalization group scheme enables us to trace the change in behavior of weakly correlated electron systems as a function of dimension , by interpolating the ratio of the hopping parameters in the two directions from zero to one .",
    "it reproduces the luttinger liquid behavior in the one - dimensional models away from commensurate band filling on one side and the fermi liquid state with its various infrared instabilities on the other side .",
    "the present rg calculation still involves a cascade of approximations but our results match well with established knowledge acquired by other methods .",
    "in one spatial dimension the quantitative precision of the rg scheme can be checked directly by exact numerical techniques : in the study of boundaries of luttinger liquids the comparison with density matrix renormalization group calculations turned out to rather promising@xcite .",
    "biermann et al.@xcite used extended dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) to calculate the quasiparticle weight in coupled chains .",
    "their findings for nonzero interchain hopping are qualitatively similar to the rg results , e.g. the suppression and also the anisotropy of the @xmath9-factors are relatively weak along the fermi surface ( note however that the rg calculation for @xmath9 applies only at weak couplings , and higher order corrections might further decrease the @xmath9-factors ) .",
    "we believe that the true strength of the @xmath0-patch rg lies in its flexibility and transparency . due to these properties",
    "the method may open the way to an unified qualitative picture of low dimensional weakly coupled electron systems .",
    "a direct conclusion of this work is the partial justification of the neglect of the wave function renormalization in several previous renormalization group studies of the 2d hubbard model@xcite .",
    "at least for the parameters used in these studies and over the scale range where the perturbative scheme is expected to be valid , the quasiparticle weight remains nonzero and its flow does not affect the one - loop flow to strong coupling in the second order approximation .",
    "similar statements can be made about the one - loop fermi surface shift@xcite and the quasiparticle scattering rate@xcite .",
    "the physical picture that is suggested by these findings for the hubbard model close to half filling is that the most plausible interpretation of the runaway flow of the coupling function is the formation of an energy gap at least on parts of the fermi surface and not a gapless state resembling a luttinger liquid . due to the limited validity range of the weak coupling approach our results",
    "can not support a conjectured pseudogap@xcite at temperatures above the antiferromagnetic instability in the half - filled hubbard model . on the other hand",
    "our calculations show that the antiferromagnetic instability and also the @xmath1-wave superconducting instability found in earlier studies @xcite persist if the flow of the quasiparticle weight is included .",
    "in particular the possibility of @xmath1-wave superconductivity in the hubbard model is still debated@xcite , however mostly at larger @xmath91 .",
    "our analysis underpins the positive answer for the weak coupling sector of the model .",
    "an analysis of the renormalization of the dispersion relation and of the higher  order flow of the coupling function will provide further checks for the existing results . regarding further applications of the method we mention the wide class of quasi-1d conductors like bechgaard or fabre salts@xcite .",
    "these systems show a variety of magnetically ordered or charge - ordered states and many undergo transitions into supposedly unconventional superconducting states .",
    "the hopping parameters of these materials are known to a good extent@xcite and a weak coupling description is expected to make sense .",
    "thus our method should be well applicable and useful to understand the main features of the phase diagrams of these materials and the interplay between one- and higher - dimensional physics .",
    "some steps in this direction have been undertaken by duprat and bourbonnais@xcite .",
    "we have used an approximation scheme where all relevant contributions up to second order in the interactions are taken into account .",
    "this correctly reproduces the luttinger liquid case , where the flow of the renormalized interaction vanishes also in second order@xcite . in those cases where the second order flow leads to strong coupling , higher order contributions will become large at some scale .",
    "the physical content of the strong coupling fixed points in two - loop @xmath102-ology studies@xcite is , however , rather questionable , as the fixed point coupling constants are typically larger than the bandwidth and thus outside the perturbative range .",
    "moreover the information obtained by careful one - loop studies of 1d systems agrees well with the results of numerical techniques or bosonization .",
    "of course , our rg method can in principle be used later on to investigate the higher order flow of the interactions as well .",
    "for the time being , note that our present scheme at least provides estimates when higher order effects such as the flow of the quasiparticle weight become important .",
    "in addition we note that the @xmath0-patch approach in its present form can be used to extract a precise landau - fermi liquid description of two - dimensional systems like the hubbard model at temperatures above the flow to strong coupling , extending existing studies@xcite that do not consider the renormalization of the quasiparticle weight . in view of the somewhat harmless flow of the @xmath9-factors in the two - dimensional models discussed above we do , however , not expect drastic changes of the results .",

    "note the extra factor @xmath208 .",
    "let us compare this with the result of taking @xmath209 in the above results .",
    "if we integrate over @xmath129 , set @xmath210 and take the limit @xmath209 , we also get only an integral over `` half of '' the fermi surface : the intersection of the level set @xmath211 ( along which we integrate ) with the support of @xmath212 ( where @xmath213 ) is , in the limit @xmath209 with @xmath214 fixed , equal to @xmath215 , which is the half of the fermi surface .",

    "looking at the details of the @xmath190 integration is also necessary for @xmath197 if @xmath37 happens to be a perfect nesting vector for the fermi surface .",
    "if there is a van hove singularity on the level set @xmath220 , the jacobian @xmath221 has a nonintegrable singularity at each point @xmath222 on @xmath220 where @xmath223 .",
    "we cut out small neighborhoods of all such singularities by a smooth partition of unity .",
