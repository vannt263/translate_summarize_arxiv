    "the problem of the expansion of a plasma into vacuum has received much attention in recent years mainly in the context of the understanding of the expansion of plasma clouds generated by laser irradiated materials @xcite .",
    "the expansion of negatively charged dust particles in cometary tails @xcite and the expansion of the solar wind plasma into the wake region of inert objects such as asteroids or the moon @xcite has also stimulated theoretical and numerical studies on the problem of the expansion of a plasma into vacuum .",
    "the impact of fast moving clusters of atoms or molecules on a solid surface are also known to produce expanding plasma clouds . in particular , dust particles , typically in the micro to nano meter range , hitting spacecraft at velocities up to hundreds of km / s",
    "have been repeatedly detected in space @xcite . in most laser plasmas experiments only the electrons ( not the ions )",
    "are heated by the laser s electromagnetic field . in these experiments , the initial state of the plasma",
    "is characterised by of hot electron population , carrying all of the energy , and a cold ion population , too tenuous for collisions to operate . on the other hand ,",
    "dust impact generated plasma clouds are initially dense enough for electrons and ions to be in thermodynamic equilibrium everywhere within the cloud with the possible exception of the cloud / vacuum interface .",
    "one fluid models @xcite , or two fluid models allowing for a separate description of ions and electrons ( see the classical review paper @xcite ) are the appropriate tools to model the collisional regime of the expansion . at some point however , provided the expansion takes place in vacuum or in a tenuous plasma and provided the collisional mean free path of an electron grows faster than the cloud radius @xmath9 , the expansion becomes collisionless and a kinetic description necessary .",
    "typically a nano meter dust particle impact at the solar wind speed is expected to ignite an expanding plasma cloud with some @xmath1 electrons and ions and a characteristic temperature of 10ev turns collisionless at cloud dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "the cloud then continues its expansion in the free collisionless regime until its density has declined to a value comparable to the ambient plasma density , which at earth s orbit occurs for a meter order cloud radius .",
    "thus , during the free collisionless expansion regime the cloud radius grows by a factor of order @xmath3 before it merges with the ambient plasma . at such small scales magnetic forces",
    "can be safely neglected given that the larmor radius of a low energy 1ev electron in interplanetary space already exceeds 600 m.    the aim of this paper is to explore the unconstrained collisionless expansion of a plasma cloud using kinetic simulations .",
    "the plasma made of identical single ionised ions and an equal number of electrons is assumed to be initially confined within a spherical shell which will be instantly removed to let the plasma expand freely into vacuum .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be initially at rest and at thermodynamic equilibrium implying equal ion and electron temperatures .",
    "this kind of initial condition differs from most of the published papers on the expansion of a plasma into vacuum where ions are generally assumed to be cold as in most laser heated laboratory plasma ( e.g. @xcite using fluid models , or @xcite using kinetic models ) .",
    "we note that some of the presented results , in particular concerning the shape of the asymptotic electron velocity distribution function ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) , have been anticipated by manfredi and mola ( 1993 ) @xcite using the strictly collisionless vlasov model and a hotter plasma . in this work",
    "we use a one dimensional n - body scheme to solve the equations of motion for a large number of ions and electrons so that collisions are not exclude a priori .",
    "the similarities between our results and the results by manfredi and mola are then due to the fact that we assume the cloud to be marginally collisional from the beginning with the expansion further reducing the collisionality until an asymptotic `` frozen '' self - similar state is reached .",
    "it is worth noting that analytic self - similar solutions in the quasi - neutral limit , where charge separation is assumed to be small exist in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such solutions are expected to hold in the limit of an electron debye length being small with respect to the cloud dimension which we do suggest to be the case if the latter turns collisionless during its expansion . however , the formation of an extended electron precursor , which appears to be inevitable in the spherical case @xcite , suggest that the quasi - neutral assumption necessarily fails in the electron dominated , outer shells of the cloud .    the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec_def ]",
    "we introduce the basic parameters and equations relevant to the problem of the expansion of a spherically symmetric plasma . since we focus our attention to the case of clouds which are initially collision dominated , we complete section [ sec_def ] with an outline the necessary conditions for a transition towards a collisionless regime to occur . in section [ sec_setup ]",
    "the initial conditions and parameters for a simulation of a typical case are specified .",
    "the results of the simulation are discussed in detail in sections [ sec_asymptotic ] to [ sec_velocities ] .",
    "a summary of the paper is presented in section [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric electron - ion plasma cloud made of @xmath11 singly charged ions and @xmath11 electrons expanding into vacuum . during the first phase of the expansion the plasma is supposed to be sufficiently dense to be dominated by interparticle collisions .",
    "this phase is conveniently described by fluid dynamics @xcite and will not be treated in this paper . under favourable conditions , however , the cloud radius @xmath12 may grow larger than the collisional mean free path of a thermal electron . at this particular radius",
    "@xmath13 the cloud plasma becomes collisionless and enters a new regime which is no longer tractable within the frame of a fluid theory .",
    "the reason for using electrons instead of ions to define the end of the collisional regime is that for a given temperature the collisionality of the latter may be substantially reduced as soon as the external shells of the cloud start moving faster than the ion thermal velocity as under such circumstances ions can no longer approach each other . as we shall see below the expansion velocity",
    "is indeed suprathermal for the ions after a short lapse of time roughly corresponding to the time required for the cloud to double its radius .",
    "as the expansion is supposed to be collisional for @xmath14 we assume that electrons and ions are initially ( at time @xmath15 ) in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium and confined within the spherical shell @xmath13 .",
    "as the state of the plasma at the end of the fluid ( collision dominated ) phase is generally not known as it strongly depends on the cloud structure at the time of its formation and also on the adopted equation of state , we assume that ions and electrons are initially distributed according to a zero mean velocity maxwell - boltzmann distribution with temperature @xmath16 . in order for the electron mean free path to be uniquely defined we do also assume that at @xmath17 the density within the cloud is spatially uniform . a more realistic description of the initial state of the cloud when @xmath13 , not even taking into account the presence of different ion species and neutrals ( e.g. @xcite ) , should include a non zero , radially varying fluid velocity profile , and a complex plasma - vacuum interface ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that even if one assumes that the early , collisional phase is governed by simple inviscid gas dynamics , the spatial and temporal structure of the expanding cloud has been shown to strongly depend on both the assumed energy equation ( isentropic , isothermal , ... ) and on the density and temperature distribution within the cloud at the time of its formation @xcite .",
    "a few words on the radial velocity profile @xmath18 . in situations where the cloud radius @xmath9 is allowed to grow much larger than the radius of the cloud at the time of its formation",
    "the evolution must be close to self - similar .",
    "unlike the density and temperature profiles , the velocity profile then converges towards @xmath19 for @xmath20 independently of the conditions at the time of formation and independently of whether the governing equations are fluid @xcite or kinetic @xcite .",
    "one may then be tempted to select a linear velocity profile @xmath21 as initial condition for the collisionless regime , where @xmath22 is the instant of cloud formation .",
    "unfortunately , such a profile is a priori incompatible with the assumption of a constant density profile unless very special , and unlikely , conditions exist at @xmath23 .",
    "more sophisticated initial conditions based on approximate self - similar solutions from compressible gas dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ) will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "previous works @xcite on the spherical expansion of a plasma into vacuum have pointed out that the problem is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 at @xmath17 , where @xmath4 is the electron debye length ( si units ) @xmath25 in equation ( [ eq_ld ] ) @xmath26 is the absolute value of the electron charge , @xmath27 the permittivity of free space , @xmath28 the temperature and @xmath29 the electron density . in equation ( [ eq_ld ] ) and during the remaining of this paper we assume that temperatures are given in energy units , i.e. temperatures are implicitly multiplied by the boltzmann constant @xmath30 . in situations when @xmath31 the thermal energy of the electrons is too low to allow for a substantial charge separation at the cloud surface :",
    "the expansion is quasi - neutral . on the other hand , in situations when @xmath32 most of the electrons are energetic enough to overcome the electrostatic forces which bind them to the ions . in this case",
    ", the cloud becomes positively charged on a time scale of the order of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the electron thermal velocity ) and the associated peak electric field is much stronger than in the quasi - neutral case . in the limit @xmath35 ( the so called coulomb explosion ) all electrons escape from the cloud and the expansion",
    "is driven mainly by the repulsive forces pushing the unshielded ions away from each other .",
    "let us now estimate the parameter @xmath7 at time @xmath17 , when the plasma becomes collisionless . to this end",
    "we use the fokker - planck expression for the mean free path of a thermal electron @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the coulomb logarithm and @xmath38 the strong interaction radius , usually defined as the larger of the classical distance for a strong electrostatic interaction between thermal electrons @xmath39 or the de broglie length for a thermal electron @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the reduced planck constant . for temperatures exceeding 9ev the quantum mechanical definition",
    "should therefore be used to define the @xmath38 . as typical cloud temperatures",
    "are expected to be of the order of a few ev up to at most 20ev and also because of the classical nature of the presented simulation , we stick to the classical definition throughout the paper .",
    "we emphasise that this assumption does not invalidate the subsequent discussions and the presented simulation for the case of temperatures higher than 9ev since we do only require @xmath38 being small with respect to the radius of the spherical shell @xmath42 defining the inner boundary of the simulation domain ( see [ sec_setup ] ) . now , even for an exceedingly hot cloud at 81ev , the quantum mechanical definition of @xmath38 is just three times larger than the classical definition .    equation ( [ eq_mfp ] ) is a good estimate of the mean free path of a thermal electron in a weakly coupled plasma with @xmath43 . for values @xmath44 equation ( [ eq_mfp ] ) may still be used as a fair estimate of @xmath45 . by noting that the initial density @xmath46 is related to the cloud radius and the total number of electrons @xmath11 via @xmath47 it follows from ( [ eq_ld ] ) and by setting @xmath48 in ( [ eq_mfp ] ) that the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 only depends on the total number of charged particles @xmath49 in the cloud , viz .",
    "@xmath50^{1/4 } .\\label{eq_lambda}\\ ] ] we note indeed , that given the constraint @xmath51 , the coulomb logarithm @xmath52 is a function of the total number of particles @xmath49 via @xmath53 which leads to the relation @xmath54 . equation ( [ eq_lambda ] ) indicates that the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 is independent of the temperature @xmath16 and much smaller than unity as @xmath49 is generally a large number and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "we conclude that at the time an initially collisional plasma cloud becomes collisionless it finds itself in the quasi - neutral expansion regime @xmath31 .",
    "for example , in the case of a @xmath57 dust particle impacting on a spacecraft at solar wind speed the generated plasma cloud contains some @xmath58 charged particles corresponding to a coulomb logarithm @xmath59 and @xmath60 .      in this paper",
    "we restrict our discussion to the unconstrained expansion of a plasma cloud where the initial cloud s radius @xmath5 increases by a large factor @xmath61 before the dynamics of the expansion becomes affected by external factors , such as the ambient plasma . in the case of a dust impact",
    "generated plasma expanding into the ambient plasma ( the interplanetary plasma ) we can neglect the ambient plasma as long as the cloud density is much higher than the ambient plasma density .",
    "indeed , for the nanodust impact considered above producing @xmath62 charges with a typical per particle energy of 10ev ( see @xcite ) one finds , by setting @xmath63 in equation ( [ eq_mfp ] ) , that the plasma cloud can be considered collisionless for @xmath5 larger than a few @xmath0 . since the initial size of the cloud , just after impact , is necessarily comparable to the size of the dust grain ( at most a few tens nm ) most of the plasma within the cloud is collisional at least during the first phase of the expansion .",
    "the growing cloud will then turn collisionless provided the mean free path @xmath45 grows faster than the cloud radius @xmath9 . disregarding the weak dependence of the coulomb logarithm @xmath52 on the plasma density @xmath29 and assuming a polytropic equation of state @xmath64 one finds @xmath65 .",
    "thus , for @xmath66 , the ratio @xmath67 is a growing function of @xmath9 which means that the plasma must turn collisionless during expansion .",
    "if during the early phase of the expansion the conductive heat flux @xmath68 is unimportant the expansion must be adiabatic with an index @xmath69 and the cloud turns increasingly collisional , at least as long as standard adiabatic fluid equations are applicable .",
    "let us estimate under which conditions the conductive heat flux is dominant by comparing the the conductive term and the adiabatic term in the energy equation for a spherically symmetric collisional gas of point particles : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the material derivative . if the plasma in the cloud is collisional we can then use the spitzer - hrm expression @xcite for the conductive flux . neglecting the contribution to the flux from the ions we therefore set @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the electron pressure .",
    "let us concentrate on the centre of the cloud at @xmath74 .",
    "if the plasma was initially uniform , at rest and spherically symmetric , it follows that density , pressure and temperature must have an extremum at @xmath74 and a vanishing first derivative at all times . on the other hand if the fluid velocity was initially zero at the centre it has to stay so for ever given that the acceleration is @xmath75 by virtue of the vanishing first derivative of the pressure .",
    "one may taylor expand the velocity near @xmath74 as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 . according to the above discussion , the taylor expansion of the temperature up to the first non constant term is @xmath78 . of course",
    ", the same expansion can be applied to both density and pressure .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath79 we can then write the energy equation ( [ eq_dtdt ] ) for the central region of the cloud as @xmath80 where @xmath81 . the first term on the right in equation ( [ eq_dtdt_0 ] ) corresponds to the adiabatic cooling due to the expansion while the second term corresponds to the non adiabatic cooling due to heat conduction . for the expansion to be non",
    "adiabatic the latter has to be of comparable order , or larger , than the former . in this case",
    "the effective polytropic index of the plasma is smaller than adiabatic @xmath82 and a transition from collisional to non collisional becomes possible if conduction is strong enough to reduce @xmath83 below the critical value @xmath84 . in order to estimate the relative importance of the 2 terms in ( [ eq_dtdt_0 ] )",
    "we need an estimate of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . using the available macroscopic parameters of the cloud , like its radius @xmath9 and the expansion velocity @xmath87 of the front",
    ", it is natural to set @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we can then estimate the departure from adiabaticity by comparing the conductive to the adiabatic term , viz @xmath90 from ( [ eq_adiabatic_ratio ] ) it appears that the expansion is adiabatic in the limit of vanishing small mean free path @xmath91 .",
    "however given that the typical expansion velocity @xmath87 is of the order of a few times the ion thermal velocity , the ratio @xmath92^{1/2})\\gg 1 $ ] is much larger than unity .",
    "thus , unless the knudsen number @xmath93 conduction is not negligible and the expansion can not be adiabatic . clouds with negligible heat conduction , i.e. for @xmath94 much smaller than @xmath95 , are expected both to remain collisional and to obey the equations of standard adiabatic gas dynamics in spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "this conclusion has to be softened somewhat as the collisional approximation for @xmath68 used in equation ( [ eq_sh ] ) may be inaccurate for @xmath96 ( e.g. @xcite ) and is even expected to saturate at @xmath97 for @xmath98 @xcite .      in the remaining of the paper we assume that the cloud under consideration goes through a phase where the knudsen number @xmath99 ensuring that the cloud turns collisionless at some critical radius @xmath13 .",
    "the free expansion then continues until the cloud s density has decreased to a level comparable to the ambient plasma . at earth orbit , where the solar wind density is generally smaller than 10 electrons per @xmath100 , the cloud density is substantially larger than the ambient plasma density for up to a meter order cloud radius @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the expansion can be assumed to be both collisionless and independent of the ambient plasma while the cloud radius @xmath9 grows from @xmath101 up to @xmath102 , which corresponds to an expansion factor @xmath103 .",
    "given such a large expansion factor it is justified to assume that all particles within the cloud have purely radial velocities @xmath104 as the transverse velocity component @xmath105 ( perpendicular to the radial direction ) rapidly decreases during expansion since the angular momentum of individual particles @xmath106 is conserved in a collisionless and spherically symmetric field . neglecting the centrifugal force due to the transverse component of the particle velocity , the equations of motion for a particle of mass @xmath107 and charge @xmath108 in a spherically symmetric force field reduce to @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the radial electric field experienced by a particle at distance @xmath79 from the cloud s centre .",
    "we shall verify a posteriori that neglecting the centrifugal term @xmath111 , which normally appears on the rhs of equation ( [ eq_dvdt ] ) , is justified by the fact that the field at the particle s position decreases asymptotically as @xmath112 ( cf section [ sec_efield ] ) , which is slower than the @xmath113 dependence from the centrifugal term .",
    "given the spherically symmetric field @xmath110 assumed in ( [ eq_dvdt ] ) the particles must be interpreted as infinitely thin spherical shells rather than point particles .",
    "this approximation is justified as long as the number of particles within a given spherical shell is large with respect to unity , i.e. for radial distances @xmath114 at time @xmath17 .",
    "strict spherical symmetry reduces the original three dimensional system to a one dimensional system which can be treated much faster on a computer .",
    "the main drawback is an unrealistic description of the central part of the cloud which does not really matter as the small ( and continuously decreasing ) number of particles living in this region makes these particles statistically irrelevant anyway .",
    "equations ( [ eq_dvdt ] ) and ( [ eq_drdt ] ) must be supplemented by an equation for the electric field which for a distribution of @xmath49 thin spherical shells of radius @xmath115 and charges @xmath116 is simply @xmath117",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the motion in phase space of a fraction of electrons and ions from a numerical simulation of a spherical cloud expanding into vacuum .",
    "positions and velocities of @xmath49 particles ( @xmath11 electrons and @xmath11 ions ) are time advanced according to equations ( [ eq_dvdt ] ) and ( [ eq_drdt ] ) using a classical third order leap frog integration scheme @xcite .",
    "the electric field is computed at every time step using the updated particles positions and the field equation ( [ eq_e ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions consist in @xmath118 particles uniformly distributed within the spherical shell @xmath119 corresponding to @xmath120 .",
    "thus , even though the simulated number of particles @xmath49 is much smaller than in a typical dust impact generated plasma cloud , it is still large enough for the key parameter @xmath7 to be much smaller than unity so that the expansion is quasi - neutral .",
    "the inner sphere @xmath121 can not be penetrated by particles and is merely there to avoid the divergence of the coulomb potential for @xmath122 when particles ( actually thin spherical shells ) approach the central region . in practice we chose @xmath123 , which is both sufficiently small to minimise its influence on the overall system s evolution and sufficiently large with respect to the strong interaction radius @xmath38 to rule out binary collisions and self - charge effects .    in the following , if not otherwise stated , we normalise charge to the elementary charge e , mass to the electron mass @xmath124 , length to @xmath42 , electric field to @xmath125 , velocities to @xmath126 , time intervals to @xmath127 and temperatures to @xmath128 . with these normalisation , and by consistently normalising density to @xmath129 ,",
    "the debye length ( [ eq_ld ] ) reads @xmath130 , the mean free path ( [ eq_mfp ] ) @xmath131 and the electric field of a point charge @xmath68 becomes @xmath132 .",
    "we then set the initial temperature , for both electrons and ions , to @xmath133 and the cloud radius to @xmath134 .",
    "the resulting coulomb logarithm is then @xmath135 and according to ( [ eq_mfp ] ) , the mean free path @xmath45 is equal to @xmath134 as postulated . in code units the thermal velocity of the electrons is @xmath136 and the strong interaction radius @xmath137 which , as required , is much smaller than both @xmath134 and @xmath138 .    for convenience in figure [ fig1 ] and in all subsequent figures we use normalised positions",
    "@xmath139 with the temporal variation of the scale length defined by @xmath140 .",
    "we choose to set the arbitrary constant @xmath141 in order to have @xmath142 .",
    "the ion to electron mass ratio is set to @xmath143 so that @xmath15 does actually turns out to be of the order of the ion sound crossing time @xmath144 , a characteristic time for the initial system . as already stated , at @xmath17 particles are uniformly distributed within the spherical shell @xmath145 following maxwell - boltzmann velocity distributions for both ions and electrons : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the thermal velocity of the corresponding species @xmath148 .",
    "the particle trajectories shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] illustrate two key aspects of the expansion which will be discussed in sections [ sec_traj ] and [ sec_phase ] .",
    "first , as @xmath20 , all trajectories are seen to collapse towards the curve @xmath149 . as a consequence the temperature at a given position @xmath150",
    "is seen to decrease with time as the particles velocities appear to be less and less scattered as time progresses .",
    "second , whereas ions rapidly line up in a structureless ribbon along the @xmath149 curve , electrons converge towards a more complex structure , also aligned on the @xmath149 curve , but with a bulging of the ribbon in the region @xmath151 . as we shall see below the bulging",
    "is due to the bouncing motion of electrons trapped in an electrostatic potential well .      in this section",
    "we show that for @xmath152 all particle trajectories must end up onto the @xmath149 curve provided the electric field decays sufficiently fast everywhere in the system . to this end",
    "we taylor expand the asymptotic evolution of a particle velocity in terms of the small parameter @xmath153 , i.e. @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is just an arbitrary finite time level . from the equation of motion ( [ eq_dvdt ] )",
    "we obtain the asymptotic evolution of a particle s velocity @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "the asymptotic evolution of the particle s position is formally obtained by integrating ( [ eq_drdt ] ) , i.e. @xmath158 . using @xmath159 from equation ( [ eq_v_asympt ] ) , and for @xmath160 one obtains @xmath161 the last term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq_xi_asympt ] ) vanishes for @xmath152 provided @xmath162 at position @xmath150 decays faster than @xmath163 in which case @xmath164 , confirming that the end point of a particle s trajectory lies on the @xmath165 curve . for a time dependence of the electric field",
    "@xmath166 it is possible to compute the slope of a particle s trajectory in the phase space directly from equations ( [ eq_v_asympt ] ) and ( [ eq_xi_asympt ] ) . indeed , assuming that for @xmath20 the variation of the electric field at a given particle position is due primarily to the time dependence of @xmath162 rather than to the particle s motion , one obtains @xmath167 .",
    "thus , for @xmath168 , corresponding to the final , self - similar , evolution of our system ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) , @xmath169 , i.e. trajectories approach the @xmath165 curve on horizontal trajectories with @xmath170 . in the particular case where @xmath171 ( which applies to the simulation for @xmath172 ) equations ( [ eq_v_asympt ] ) and ( [ eq_xi_asympt ] ) reduce to @xmath173 equation ( [ eq_xi_inf ] )",
    "shows that for sufficiently late times @xmath174 confirming that the variation of the electric field at particle s position is asymptotically dominated by the field decay and not by the particle s motion .",
    "the interesting point about equation ( [ eq_xi_inf ] ) is that it shows that for @xmath20 ( which allows neglecting the @xmath175 term ) particles approach their final position @xmath176 from the left or the right depending on the sign of @xmath177 .",
    "thus , in an overall positive electric field , which is indeed the case for the expanding cloud problem at hand ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) , ions approach their final position from the left in @xmath178 space while electrons approach their final position from the right .",
    "thus , ions ( electrons ) which are initially on the right ( left ) of the @xmath149 curve will first cross the @xmath149 curve before converging towards their asymptotic position on horizontal @xmath179 trajectories .",
    "this behaviour is already visible on the early phase of the expansion shown on figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the shrinking of the phase space volume occupied by the particles in the @xmath178 phase space is merely the consequence of the time dependence of the scaling length @xmath12 .",
    "the equations of motion for an individual particle ( [ eq_dvdt ] ) and ( [ eq_drdt ] ) deriving from the general hamiltonian of the system @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 , it follows that any volume @xmath183 must be conserved along particle trajectories in @xmath184 space .",
    "thus , @xmath185 with the consequence that @xmath186 , i.e. the volume covered by the particles in the @xmath178 phase space shrinks in time as @xmath187",
    ". on the long term all particles must end up aligned on the @xmath149 curve with the spatial distribution of the charges being a function of the initial conditions , i.e. on the dimensionless parameter @xmath188 only .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show characteristic trajectories of selected electrons and ions in ( @xmath189 ) phase space . from the figures it is immediately apparent that both species behave in a radically different way .",
    "ions follow rather dull trajectories and are either accelerated outwards ( in particular the outermost ones ) or move at approximately constant velocity .",
    "the fastest electrons ( in general the ones at largest radial distance @xmath150 ) are seen to steadily reduce their outflow velocity in the attractive field of the positively charged interior of the cloud .",
    "however , electrons , with sufficiently low initial energy ( the ones with end velocity @xmath190 ) , do cross the @xmath149 curve and eventually bounce within an electrostatic trap . in",
    "order to understand the trajectories in the @xmath178 space it may be useful to rewrite the equations of motion ( [ eq_dvdt ] ) and ( [ eq_drdt ] ) by setting @xmath191 , viz @xmath192 where we have used @xmath193 with @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_dvdxi ] ) shows that when a trajectory crosses the @xmath165 it satisfies the condition @xmath196 ( cf figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) unless the electric field @xmath197 . in this particular case",
    "the particle s velocity is constant @xmath198 and ( [ eq_dxidt ] ) shows that it takes an infinite time for the particle to reach the @xmath149 curve as @xmath199 .",
    "multiple reflections are associated with an equal number of crossings of the @xmath149 curve , from top to bottom for an inward directed force and from bottom to top for an outward directed force .",
    "note that particles approaching the centre @xmath200 make an artificial reflection there as their radial velocity must change from negative to positive .",
    "given that in the simulations particles are not allowed to approach the centre at a distance less than @xmath201 reflection does effectively occur at @xmath202 instead .",
    "electrons bouncing back and forth in an expanding potential well can be efficiently cooled by first order fermi deceleration .",
    "now , despite the fact that both , bouncing and non bouncing electrons lose kinetic energy , the phase space volume occupied by the two populations evolves differently in time .",
    "thus , whereas the velocity difference @xmath203 between two electrons with initial velocities @xmath204 and @xmath205 increases in time for @xmath206 , the opposite is true for the trapped ( and eventually bouncing ) electrons with initial velocities @xmath207 ( see figure [ fig3 ] )",
    ". loosely speaking , trapped electrons contribute to rise the particle concentration @xmath208 in velocity space while non trapped electrons , and basically all ions , contribute to reduce the particle concentration in velocity space .",
    "both effects are visible in figure [ fig5 ] which shows that @xmath209 substantially grows over its initial value for @xmath210 where fermi deceleration occurs . for @xmath211",
    "the electron trajectories in velocity space are divergent and @xmath209 falls below its initial value , instead .    a schematic representation of the electron dynamics in phase space and the corresponding evolution of their velocity distribution function @xmath212 summarising the discussion of this section is shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that some electrons have time to bounce several times during the simulation before their motion becomes frozen onto the @xmath149 curve .",
    "others , for example the ones with initial velocity @xmath213 and final velocity near @xmath214 are unable to perform a full bounce period during the time of the simulation .",
    "the reason is that the bouncing period @xmath215 for a particle of mass @xmath107 and charge @xmath108 moving in the potential @xmath216 of a point charge @xmath68 is of the order @xmath217 ( kepler s third law ) so that @xmath218 grows faster than the expansion time @xmath219 .",
    "thus , as the bouncing time to expansion time ratio @xmath220 grows as @xmath221 the bouncing motion for a given particle will become frozen as soon as @xmath222 exceeds a value of order unity .",
    "electrons for which @xmath223 may just be a able to bounce once but may still lose a significant fraction of their initial kinetic energy if their total energy ( kinetic + potential ) is small and negative . a particle hitting a wall moving at velocity @xmath224",
    "is slowed down by @xmath225 or @xmath226 depending on whether its initial velocity @xmath227 is in the range @xmath228 or @xmath229 , respectively . given that the expansion velocity of the electrostatic walls is rather slow compared to the electron thermal velocity @xmath230 ( the peak of the electrostatic profile in figure [ fig8 ] at @xmath231 moves outwards at a velocity @xmath232 ) , 2 or 3 reflections are required to slow down a thermal electron below the critical velocity @xmath233 which separates bouncing and non bouncing electrons ( see figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the maximum initial velocity @xmath234 of a trapped electron can be estimated by equating the bouncing period @xmath215 and the expansion time @xmath235 @xmath236^{1/2}\\label{eq_v_star}.\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq_v_star ] ) may appear rather useless , @xmath237 being an unknown function of @xmath150 .",
    "however , we expect the right hand side of equation ( [ eq_v_star ] ) to be largest after a short time of the order @xmath238 ( the inverse electron plasma frequency ) from the beginning of the simulation .",
    "thus , an a priori estimate is possible if we assume that @xmath68 corresponds to the number of electrons in the outer debye shell of the initial cloud , i.e. @xmath239 . in the present case @xmath118 and @xmath240 so that @xmath241 . with these numbers and by setting @xmath242 and @xmath243 in equation ( [ eq_v_star ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath244 which appears to be a fair estimate of the upper limit for the initial velocity of trapped electrons ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic ion velocity distribution is shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the ion distribution closely follows the electron distribution for @xmath245 ( roughly twice the ion thermal velocity @xmath246 ) while at higher velocities , up to the velocity of the fastest ions in the simulation @xmath247 , the ion density is in excess over the electron density . on the other hand , for @xmath248",
    "the asymptotic distribution @xmath249 falls below its initial value @xmath250 while the opposite occurs for @xmath251 . in principle , given that the mobile electrons tend to escape from the cloud , all ions should be accelerated outwards by the positive charge @xmath237 of the remnant ( see bottom panel of figure [ fig9 ] ) and its associated , outwards directed electric field ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the outwards directed force should produce a displacement towards larger radial velocities of the original velocity distribution @xmath252 with @xmath253 below some minimum velocity .",
    "the displacement of @xmath254 towards higher radial velocity is visible in [ fig7 ] for the fastest ions with end velocities @xmath251 .",
    "however , no region with @xmath255 is visible at low velocities , though .",
    "the reason is that the slow ions are kept in the inner part of the cloud by the inwards falling , fermi decelerated , electrons .",
    "the coupling between ions and cold electrons is so efficient there that the electric field asymptotically goes to zero for @xmath256 ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] also shows that up to @xmath257 both electron and ion velocity distributions are conveniently fitted by a single maxwellian distribution with thermal speed @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the average particle mass .",
    "if we assume that the electron distribution is a maxwellian sharply cut at an upper velocity @xmath234 , such that the missing electrons are those in the outer debye shell of the initial sphere @xmath260 , we obtain the estimate @xmath261 ( where @xmath262 is the error function ) which gives @xmath263 .",
    "obviously , @xmath264 is an overestimate of the number of electrons in the electron precursor . from figure [ fig9 ]",
    "we take that this number is roughly 5 times smaller than @xmath264 which allows for a more realistic estimate @xmath265 , i.e. @xmath266 .",
    "the spatial and temporal structure of the electric field is shown in figure [ fig8 ] .    as expected , after a dynamic initial phase , when particles are close to their asymptotic position in the @xmath178 space , the electric field intensity decays as @xmath267 .",
    "the spatial structure @xmath268 is characterised by a central region @xmath269 where , apart from fluctuations due to the small number of particles , the field intensity is essentially zero , corresponding to the region where the electron and ion density are equal ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) . for @xmath270",
    "the field intensity rapidly rises towards the maximum @xmath271 at @xmath272 , followed by a gentler negative slope over a much larger spatial scale .",
    "the large scale is associated with the scale of the electron precursor , which is obviously forged by the initial electron velocity distribution , and scales as @xmath273 .",
    "the shorter scale of the rising part of the field profile is forged by the ions and scales as @xmath274 .    the charge distribution at the end of the simulation at @xmath275 is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig9 ] where , again , @xmath237 represents the charge within the sphere of radius @xmath150 .",
    "the maximum @xmath276 is reached for @xmath277 .",
    "thus @xmath278 , corresponding to roughly @xmath279 of the positive charge contained in the outermost debye shell of the cloud at @xmath280 . on the other hand",
    "the charge at the position of the electric field maximum is @xmath281 giving a maximum field intensity @xmath282 as confirmed by the latest profiles of @xmath162 shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "changing to si units we obtain a more useful expression @xmath283 where @xmath284 is expressed in v / m and @xmath9 in metres .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the spatial fluid velocity profiles @xmath285 for both electron and ions at the end of the simulation .",
    "not surprisingly both populations have velocities profiles close to the @xmath149 curve ( top panel ) . plotting the fluid velocities @xmath286 versus @xmath150 ( bottom panel ) shows that while all ions and electrons located within @xmath287 do closely follow the @xmath149 curve ( meaning that they are already frozen ) electrons with @xmath288 stay below the @xmath149 curve .",
    "these electrons are still flowing ( falling ) inwards along the dashed lines , corresponding to the @xmath289 trajectories predicted for a @xmath290 declining electric field ( see section [ sec_traj ] ) .",
    "the electron inflow velocity at @xmath275 peaks near @xmath291 at about @xmath292 of the absolute ion fluid velocity .",
    "the ion velocity will not evolve significantly after @xmath275 as it is already well approximated by @xmath293 .",
    "the asymptotic position of the electrons near @xmath294 at @xmath275 , will lie some @xmath292 closer to the centre of the cloud .",
    "this late displacement of the electrons will not modify the final structure of the electric field significantly as the density of these inflowing electron is substantially lower than the ion density near @xmath295 ( see figure top panel in [ fig9 ] ) . on the other hand , electrons at @xmath296 are too fast for the ions to catch up with and constitute the final electron precursor .",
    "when dust particles travelling in the interplanetary space hit a solid object at characteristic velocities of the order of tens to hundreds km / s , a plasma cloud is generated at the impact point .",
    "the cloud is formed due to the vaporisation and partial ionisation of the dust particle itself and the target material .",
    "the subsequent expansion of the cloud is hemispherical rather then spherical as assumed in the above model . in the case of",
    "a non conducting and charge neutral target the above results should not be modified in any substantial way . on the other hand",
    ", one should be extremely cautious when trying to interpret the electric signals measured on a spacecraft as spacecraft are generally positively charged due to electrons being stripped from their metallic surface through photoionisation by solar radiation .",
    "the associated electric field ( typically of the order of a few v / m ) exceeds the cloud s internal electric field very early during the expansion , causing stripping of most of the cloud s electrons @xcite .",
    "not only is the expanding cloud subject to charging so that the long term expansion is more like a coulomb explosion@xcite rather than a quasi - neutral expansion as described above , but the role of the photoelectrons , continually emitted and recollected by the spacecraft , must be taken into account when trying to interpret the voltage pulses measured on spacecraft antennae . indeed , in the scenario described in appendix a of the zaslawsky et al paper @xcite ) , the voltage pulses measured on individual antennae in conjunction with the impact of nano dusts on the stereo spacecraft are not a direct measure of the field within the post impact expanding plasma cloud but are the consequence of the equilibrium photoelectron return current towards the part of the antenna within the plasma cloud being interrupted .",
    "the interruption of the photoelectron return current induces an accumulation of positive charges on the antenna which is then measured by on board detectors as a temporal variation of the potential between the antenna and the spacecraft .    let us estimate the electrostatic potential through a real cloud generated by a nanoparticle hitting a target in interplanetary space using the above model . as we shall see the intrinsic field of the cloud is too weak to account for the impact associated potential pulses observed on stereo .",
    "the electrostatic potential through the simulated plasma cloud is shown in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "the total drop in the electrostatic potential is @xmath297 while , as already stated , the peak charge is @xmath298 ( see bottom panel in figure [ fig9 ] ) . assuming a linear relation between @xmath299 and @xmath300 we find @xmath301 this relation can be interpreted as the electrostatic potential at the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath302 enclosing a charge @xmath300 .",
    "multiplication of equation ( [ eq_deltav ] ) by @xmath303 in si units , leads to the dimensional version of ( [ eq_deltav ] ) : @xmath304 where @xmath9 is in meters and @xmath305 in volts .",
    "let us use equation ( [ eq_deltav_si ] ) to estimate the voltage pulse @xmath299 due to the impact of a @xmath306 kg grain ( size @xmath307 nm ) travelling at @xmath308km / s .",
    "the number of electrons and ions within the plasma cloud can be estimated via the semi - empirical formula @xmath309 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath310={\\rm c}$ ] , @xmath311=$]kg and @xmath312=$]km / s . with these parameters",
    "we obtain @xmath313 and , from the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath49 established in the discussion following equation ( [ eq_lambda ] ) we find @xmath314 . plugging this value into in equation ( [ eq_deltav_si ] ) leads to @xmath315 .",
    "thus , when the cloud s radius has grown to @xmath316 cm , i.e. when its density has fallen to a value comparable to the interplanetary density , @xmath317 only . noting that the effectively measured voltage is obtained by averaging over the whole antenna length , i.e. by multiplying the above voltage by @xmath318 , where @xmath319 is the length of the antenna ( 6 m on stereo ) and @xmath320 the length of the part of the antenna within the cloud , the voltage predicted by the model is far too week to be directly detectable and in any case much too weak to induce the up to 100mv pulses observed on stereo .",
    "previous estimates of the voltage pulse associated with nano - size dust impacts were based on the assumption that the charge separation within the expanding cloud is total with @xmath321 electrons in the precursor@xcite .",
    "the assumption , adopted here , that charge separation only occurs at the time when the expanding cloud becomes collisionless , without influence of potential external fields , reduces the number of electrons in the precursor to a much smaller number of order @xmath322 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq_emax ] ) we can estimate the maximum electric field within the above cloud to be of order @xmath323 .",
    "thus , when the cloud has reached @xmath324 the maximum field is already down to 1v / m , i.e. comparable to the spacecraft s own field . beyond this size ,",
    "the cloud will start loosing its electrons to the spacecraft .",
    "however , even in case of a complete charge separation such that the electrostatic field outside the cloud is given by the coulomb field @xmath216 , the latter is much too weak ( at most a few mv ) to account for the on board measured voltage pulses associated with nanodust impacts . as we shall explain in more details in a forthcoming paper , but as already briefly exposed in the appendix a of @xcite , the strong potential pulses measured on individual antennas on stereo are due to the perturbative effect of the expanding cloud on the photoelectrons surrounding the antenna .",
    "we have explored numerically the unconstrained spherically symmetric expansion of an initially uniform , overall neutral and at thermodynamic equilibrium cloud of immobile plasma .",
    "the initial temperature and density of the plasma are such that the cloud s radius equals the fokker - planck collisional mean free path of a thermal electron , representing an admittedly crude model of an expanding cloud at the time it becomes collisionless . consistently assuming that the ion and electron velocity distributions are maxwellians at the time of the collisional to collisionless transition",
    ", it follows that the key parameter of the problem @xmath24 can be written as a function of the total number of ions and electrons in the cloud only . due to the @xmath325 dependence ( see equation ( [ eq_lambda ] ) ) typical nano size grain impacts which are expected to ignite plasma clouds with @xmath326 , @xmath7 is always much smaller then unity , i.e. the collisionless expansion is quasi - neutral .    during the initial phase of the collisionless regime most electrons ( the less energetic ones )",
    "lose nearly all of their kinetic energy thorough fermi deceleration in the expanding potential ( see figure [ fig11 ] ) . on the other hand the outermost ions near the electric field maximum ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) ,",
    "are accelerated outwards by the positive electric field .",
    "the net effect is that ions and electrons do asymptotically tend towards having the same velocity distribution up to a threshold of the order of the ion thermal velocity ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the fact that all particle trajectories converge towards the @xmath149 curve as @xmath20 implies that electron and ion fluid velocities end up being simple linear functions of the distance @xmath79 from the expansion centre .    at late times the ion density profile is conveniently described by @xmath327 $ ] where @xmath328 is the thermal velocity based on the initial temperature @xmath16 and the mean mass @xmath329 . because of @xmath31 the electron density @xmath330 closely follows the ion density up to a distance @xmath331 solution of the equation @xmath332 .",
    "beyond this point the electron density is flat up to a radial distance of the order of @xmath333 as observed in vlasov simulations @xcite .",
    "the electric field is essentially zero for @xmath334 ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) but rises towards a maximum on the ion length scale @xmath335 and decreases slowly on the electron precursor length scale @xmath336 . at late times",
    "the maximum field intensity @xmath337 is essentially nailed down by the number of electrons in the outer shell of the cloud of thickness @xmath338 .",
    "this number can be expressed in terms of the total number of particles @xmath49 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath339 to give @xmath340 , implying that the electric field intensity must be proportional to @xmath341 . in our representative simulation",
    ", we find @xmath342 which we expect to hold as long as @xmath343 and provided the cloud has changed from collisional to collisionless during expansion .",
    "the electrostatic potential through the cloud has been found to be @xmath344 .",
    "the electrostatic potential difference between the cloud s centre and infinity predicted by the model is far too weak to be account for the voltage pulses , sometimes exceeding 100mv , observed on the s / waves tds detector on the stereo spacecraft following a nano - sized dust particles impact .",
    "one plausible reason for this discrepancy is that spacecraft are positively charged due to photoelectron emission through their sunlight exposed surfaces .",
    "the resulting electric field , typically of the order of a few @xmath345 at 1au from the sun , generally exceeds the maximum field intensity within the plasma cloud before its dilution in the ambient plasma .",
    "the late evolution of the cloud is therefore dominated by the spacecraft field which strips most or all of the electrons from the cloud which then sees both its charge and its internal electrostatic potential field increase by a factor of order @xmath346 . however , even in case of an unrealistically large nanodust impact generated cloud with some @xmath347 and with all electrons stripped - off , the total electrostatic potential difference would merely be a smallish @xmath348 at the time of its maximum extension , when @xmath349 .",
    "considering that the measured field is down by at least a factor @xmath350 , where @xmath319 is the the total length of the antenna ( @xmath351 on the stereo spacecraft ) , one must conclude that the on board measured fields are not a direct measure of the cloud s intrinsic field .",
    "indeed , recent findings by zaslavsky et al @xcite indicate that nanodust impact associated clouds strongly affect the photoelectron environment of the antenna . in the scenario proposed by zaslavsky et al the photoelectrons emitted by the sunlight exposed surface of the antenna",
    "are temporarily hindered to fall back onto it because of the presence of the cloud s perturbing field .",
    "the resulting net photoelectron current is strong enough to allow for a fast positive charging of the antenna which is compatible with the measured field intensities .",
    "the bottom line is that the presented model is not directly applicable to the case of plasma clouds generated by nanodust impacts on spacecraft as neither the spacecraft potential nor the surrounding photoelectrons have been considered .",
    "the model is however expected to be applicable in case of nanodust impacts on uncharged targets .",
