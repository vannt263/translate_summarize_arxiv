    "the availability of ultra - short laser pulses @xcite opens up new ways of studying time - dependent electronic processes in atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite and at solid surfaces @xcite . in surface physics the time delay of a core electron emitted through the surface potential barrier can now be compared on an attosecond timescale with valence electron photoemission in time - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "this makes it important to develop appropriate theoretical tools for studying such processes , in particular for solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation accurately .",
    "a problem arises with the boundary in solving this equation  if an electron is ejected from an atom , for example , how is its wave - function treated as it propagates outwards towards the edge of the computational region ?",
    "one approach is to apply absorbing boundary conditions at the edge of the region @xcite , but this is an approximation @xcite ; complex coordinate methods can also be used to remove the outgoing wave in solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "other methods are used in atomic physics to study photoionization in particular  the wave - function can be expanded in complex basis functions @xcite , and floquet methods use a floquet - fourier series expansion of the wave - function @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been work on transparent boundary conditions , so that the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation in some restricted region of interest , which we call region i , propagates out through the boundary into the rest of the system , region ii , without reflection .",
    "it has been shown by hellums and frensley @xcite using a matrix partitioning of the hamiltonian that these boundary conditions are equivalent to an extra `` memory '' term  a time - dependent embedding or self - energy term  added to the hamiltonian .",
    "this spatial partitioning , and the corresponding form of the embedding term , is appropriate for a hamiltonian constructed with localized basis functions or spatially discretized wave - functions .    an embedding method for solving the time - independent schrdinger equation in the region of interest was developed many years ago by the author @xcite .",
    "the operator which embeds region i  the embedding potential  is given by the surface inverse of a green function for region ii , evaluated over the boundary between the regions .",
    "any convenient basis set can be used to expand the wave - functions ( or green function ) in region i , and the method has been widely used in accurate surface calculations @xcite , and recently in photonics applications @xcite .",
    "the embedding potential is a generalized logarithmic derivative , giving the normal derivative of the wave - function over the boundary of region i in terms of the amplitude  in mathematical terms it is a dirichlet - to - neumann map @xcite .",
    "it is this form of embedding potential , rather than a tight - binding or discretized form , which we shall apply in this paper to the time - dependent problem .",
    "the time - dependent version of the dirichlet - to - neumann map has been studied by ehrhardt @xcite , and applied to embedding the time - dependent schrdinger equation , discretized spatially as well as temporally  ehrhardt paid particular attention to the stability and accuracy of the time - evolution .",

    "recently kurth _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have developed a spatially discretized method to study quantum transport through a structure between two leads , replacing the leads by time - dependent embedding self - energies ; they also consider time - varying bias potentials in the leads .",

    "( this wave - function is the bound state of the static potential ; the oscillating potential is equivalent , by the kramers - henneberger transformation @xcite , to the static potential in a spatially uniform time - varying electric field . )",
    "they solve this problem on a finite spatial grid , with the boundary relationship , for zero potential in the external region , applied to the end grid points .    instead of using a finite - difference grid , ermolaev _ et al .",

    "the matrix element of the kinetic energy operator evaluated over this finite region of space gives a normal derivative term at the boundary of region i , and this is evaluated using the green function relationship with the boundary amplitude .",
    "they also consider the time - evolution of the bound state of the @xmath2 potential , but instead of transforming the spatially homogeneous , time - varying electric field using the kramers - henneberger transformation , they treat the problem directly , with a sinusoidally - varying field in region ii .",
    "like ermolaev _ et al .",
    "_ we will also use a basis set for expanding the wave - function in region i , but we incorporate the amplitude - derivative relationship in a way analogous to the energy - dependent embedding method @xcite .",
    "we begin this paper with a derivation in section 2 of the time - dependent embedding method , based on our original method for embedding the stationary schrdinger equation . in section 3",
    "we derive the time - dependent embedding potential analytically for a constant external potential in region ii , and demonstrate a numerical technique for embedding on to a constant electric field .",
    "we move on to model applications in sections 4 and 5 . in section 4",
    "we shall consider the same problem as boucke _",
    "@xcite  the oscillating potential @xmath3 $ ] acting on the @xmath4 bound state , using a very small region i enclosing this potential and embedding on to zero potential on either side .",
    "we shall see that the results are in excellent agreement with a finite - difference calculation extending a large distance on either side of the time - varying potential . in this section",
    "we shall next consider the excitation of a localized wave - function at a the surface of a free - electron metal by a time - dependent perturbation , with a static electric field on the vacuum side of the surface .",
    "we could use this in a model of photo - assisted field emission @xcite , or even pump - probe experiments ; here the calculation provides a test of the embedding potential for a uniform electric field .",
    "the problems we solve in section 4 are restricted to wave - functions confined initially to region i , though in the course of time - evolution they leak outside .",
    "this is a severe restriction for surface physics or other condensed matter applications , where the initial wave - function is usually an extended state . in section 5",
    "we shall show how the time - evolution of such wave - functions can be calculated using embedding , with region i containing the time - dependent perturbing potential , but not necessarily the starting wave - function .",
    "the model calculation we shall describe in section 5 corresponds to the surface of a free - electron metal , with a sinusoidal time - dependent potential applied in the surface region ( region i ) . with a small basis set",

    "the embedding problem can be represented schematically by figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we wish to solve the schrdinger equation  either time - independent or time - dependent  in the whole system , regions i + ii : region i is treated explicitly , and region ii is replaced by an `` embedding potential '' at the interface s , added on to the hamiltonian for region i. in a typical application to surfaces , region i would be the surface layer or two of atoms together with the potential barrier region , and region ii would be the vacuum on one side and the substrate crystal on the other @xcite .",
    "the embedding potential ensures that the wave - functions evaluated in region i match correctly in amplitude and derivative on to the appropriate solutions of the schrdinger equation in region ii .",
    "the original embedding method is based on a variational principle for the energy , and we shall here outline the derivation @xcite .",

    "it is assumed that at an external boundary ( the dashed line in figure [ fig1 ] ) , the wave - functions satisfy a homogeneous boundary condition , typically going to zero . the expectation value of @xmath13 is then given by @xmath14 the first two terms in the numerator are the expectation values of the hamiltonian in regions i and ii .",
    "the third term , an integral over the boundary s , contains the difference in normal derivatives on either side of s ( measured outwards from i ) and comes from the kinetic energy operator acting on the kink in the trial function .",
