    "according to latest observations @xcite , around 69% of the universe is constituted by the dark energy ( de ) sector , responsible for its current accelerating phase , and almost 26% by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) sector in the form of dust .",
    "these two sectors are considered not to interact with each other , and the resulting scenario has been believed to be the best description of the present observable universe , due to its agreement with a large number of independent observations . however , some potential problems such as the coincidence one @xcite , namely why are the dark energy and dark matter energy densities of the same order although they follow completely different evolutions , have led to a large amount of research towards scenarios in which the above two dark sectors exhibit a direct interaction .",
    "such a mutual direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter can not be excluded from the field theoretical point of view , independently of the specific nature of the former , i.e. whether it arises through a universe - content modification @xcite or through a gravitational modification @xcite . hence , many different scenarios of interacting dark energy have been constructed ( see @xcite for reviews and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly enough , recently it has been shown that the current data might favor the late - time interaction between cdm and the vacuum energy @xcite or the dynamical dark energy sector @xcite .    in the present work we are interested in providing updated constraints on the scenarios of interacting dark energy , using the very recent observational data , along with the new local value of the hubble parameter with a 2.4@xmath0 determination , released in @xcite .",
    "in particular , considering a direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background , and assuming that both ( effective ) fluids obey a barotropic equation of state , the cosmological dynamics becomes richer and thus the evolution equations for cdm and dark energy become different from their standard forms .",
    "hence , one can use observational data in order to fit the deviation from non - interaction , without the need to specify a specific interaction form , i.e. keeping the analysis in a general ground .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ide ] we provide a brief description of the expansion history of the universe in the background of an interacting scenario . in section [ data ]",
    "we describe the latest data sets for our analysis , while in section [ results ] we use them and we extract the constraints on the various quantities .",
    "finally , section [ discu ] is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "let us briefly describe the scenario of interacting dark energy . in a background of a frw universe with",
    "metric @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the scale factor and @xmath5 the spatial curvature ( with @xmath6 for flat , open and closed universe respectively ) , the first friedmann equation can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble rate , with dots denoting derivatives with respect to the cosmic time , and with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denoting the energy densities of radiation , baryons , cold dark matter and dark energy , respectively .",
    "since the physics of the radiation and baryonic sector is known quite well , we assume that these sectors are independently conserved . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dark energy and dark matter sectors interact directly , the energy conservation law for the interacting cdm - de components reads as @xmath13 , where the total energy - momentum tensor is @xmath14 , or equivalently @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a specific interaction form that has to be chosen by hand . as usual",
    ", one can quantify the effect of the above interaction on the dark matter evolution through a deviation from the standard dust - matter evolution , namely considering that the dark matter energy density evolves as @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 the present value , and where the parameter @xmath19 becomes zero in the non - interacting case .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath19 quantifies the deviation from non - interacting case ( @xmath20 corresponds to energy flow from dark matter to dark energy ) , without the need to consider a specific interaction form @xmath16 . combining ( [ dotrho ] ) , ( [ rho0a3 ] ) and considering that the dark energy sector is described by an equation - of - state parameter of the form @xmath21",
    ", we find that the energy density of the dark energy component evolves as @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the present value of @xmath12 .",
    "clearly , in the absence of a coupling with the cdm component , the conventional dynamical dark energy scenario is recovered .",
    "note that for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we may identify @xmath26 and the above expressions reduce to the vacuum decaying scenario @xcite .",
    "in the present work we confront the constraints on the cosmological parameters that can be obtained by probes that map the late - time universe ( @xmath27 ) expansion history .",
    "the baseline of our analysis is the hubble parameter measurements obtained with the cosmic chronometers ( cc ) technique , however we additionally consider standard probes such as supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) , local hubble parameter value @xmath28 ones , and baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements ( bao ) , to diminish the degeneracy between the free parameters of the models . in the following subsections , we present the data sets considered in our analysis .",
    "the cc approach to measure @xmath29 was first introduced in @xcite , and it uses relative ages of the most massive and passively evolving galaxies to measure @xmath30 , from which @xmath29 is inferred . the latest implementation has been explained in detail in @xcite , where the possible sources of uncertainty and related issues are also discussed .",
    "we consider the compilation of hubble parameter measurements provided by @xcite .",
    "it contains the latest updated list of @xmath29 measurements @xcite obtained with the cosmic chronometers approach , comprising of 30 measurements spanning the redshift range @xmath31 .",
    "this sample covers roughly 10 gyr of cosmic time .",
    "furthermore , in our analysis we also include the new local value of @xmath28 as measured by @xcite with a 2.4 @xmath0 determination , which yields @xmath32 km / s / mpc .",
    "sne ia were the main tool to discover late - time acceleration @xcite , and they still provide the best constraints on dark energy sector .",
    "sne ia are very bright `` standard candles '' and thus are used to measure cosmic distances .",
    "we consider here the latest ",
    "joint light curves \" ( jla ) sample @xcite , comprised of 740 sne ia in the redshift range @xmath33 $ ] . from the observational point of view",
    ", the distance modulus of a sne ia can be abstracted from its light curve assuming that supernovae with identical color , shape and galactic environment have on average the same intrinsic luminosity for all redshifts .",
    "this hypothesis is quantified by a empirical linear relation , yielding a standardized distance modulus @xmath34 of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 corresponds to the observed peak magnitude in rest frame b band and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are nuisance parameters in the distance estimate .",
    "the absolute magnitude is related to the host stellar mass ( @xmath40 ) by a simple step function : @xmath41 if @xmath42 , otherwise @xmath43 .",
    "the light - curve parameters ( @xmath36 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) result from the fit of a model of the sne ia spectral sequence to the photometric data . in our analysis",
    "we assume @xmath39 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 as nuisance parameters .",
    "another important cosmological probe are the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "the bao can be traced to pressure waves at the recombination epoch , generated by cosmological perturbations in the primeval baryon - photon plasma , appearing as distinct peaks in large angular scales .",
    "we use the following bao data to constrain the expansion history of the scenario at hand : the measurement from the six degree field galaxy survey ( 6df ) @xcite , the main galaxy sample of data release 7 of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - mgs ) @xcite , the lowz and cmass galaxy samples of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss - lowz and boss - cmass , respectively ) @xcite , and the distribution of the lymanforest in boss ( boss - ly ) @xcite .",
    "these measurements and their corresponding effective redshift @xmath47 are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data measurements included in our analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see , when analyzing the scenario with @xmath48 + @xmath28 data , we observe that @xmath25 combined with @xmath49 is preferred ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , when we break the degeneracy of the parameters , combining the analysis with sneia / jla + bao + cmb observations , namely using @xmath48 + @xmath28 + sne ia @xmath50 bao + cmb data , we observe that @xmath51 ( with a minor tendency for @xmath52 , i.e. for an energy flow from dark energy to dark matter ) , however with @xmath53 up to 3@xmath2 confidence level .",
    "more specifically we note that @xmath54 at 3@xmath2 .",
    "the 2@xmath2 confidence - level bounds can be seen in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "hence , we deduce that the global fits from the map of the universe expansion history have a slight preference towards a cosmological scenario of interacting dark energy .",
    "this is the main result of the present investigation , and it is in agreement with the results of other observational works @xcite , however it has been arisen through the novel use of the recently released cosmic chronometers data .",
    "in the present work we have extracted observational constraints on the scenario of interacting dark energy , without the need to consider a specific interaction form , using the recently released cosmic chronometers data . in particular , considering a general direct interaction between dark matter and dark energy sectors has the general effect of altering the evolution of the former to @xmath55 , where @xmath19 is the parameter that quantifies the deviation from the non - interacting case .",
    "hence , one can use observational data in order to fit @xmath19 as well as the other cosmological parameters .",
    "in our analysis we used ( i ) the very recently released cosmic chronometer data sets along with the very latest measured value of the local hubble parameter , @xmath32 km / s / mpc @xcite , ( ii ) `` joint light curves '' ( jla ) sample containing 740 latest supernovae type ia data points , ( iii ) baryon acoustic oscillation data points , ( iv ) cmb distance priors adopting 2015 planck tt , te , ee + lowp data , marginalized over the amplitude of the lensing power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we presented two different sets of values of the model parameters , one arising using the combined set of @xmath48 + @xmath28 data ( summarized in fig .",
    "[ qm1 ] and table [ tab2 ] ) , and one arising using the @xmath48 + @xmath28 + sneia / jla + bao + cmb data ( summarized in fig .",
    "[ qm2 ] and table [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "we found that the combined analysis @xmath48 + @xmath28 slightly favors a non - zero value for the interacting parameter @xmath19 , while the dark energy equation - of - state parameter lies below @xmath56 .",
    "additionally , for the combined analysis , using @xmath48 + @xmath28+sneia / jla @xmath50 bao @xmath50 cmb data , we found that @xmath19 is close to zero , nevertheless the possibility of a small interaction is not ruled out , and moreover we find that the dark energy equation - of - state parameter lies below @xmath56 at 3@xmath2 confidence level .",
    "in summary , using the latest observational data , we have found that an interaction between dark matter and dark energy sectors is mildly favored .",
