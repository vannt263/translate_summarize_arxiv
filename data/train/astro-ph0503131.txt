    "nova persei 1901 ( gk per ) is one of the most extensively observed and studied classical nova shells over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "it is known to be a fast onemg nova with v@xmath17 1200 km s@xmath5 , m@xmath17 7 @xmath18 m@xmath12 and distance @xmath19 470 pc ( payne - gaposchkin 1957 ; mc laughlin 1960 , pottasch 1959 ) .",
    "nova persei ( 1901 ) is the first recorded nova to show a light echo due to the reflection of light off the nearby interstellar material ( kapteyn 1901 ) .",
    "coudrec ( 1939 ) shows that the light echo region and the reflection nebula detected later in 1917 ( barnard 1917 ; oort 1951 ) around gk per are results of large - scale circumstellar sheets of dust clouds .",
    "the optical remnant is 103@xmath2090 arcsec@xmath21 ( diameter@xmath140.23 pc ) .",
    "the images show high asymmetry and the remnant has evolved into series of knots and filaments .",
    "the bulk of emission arises in the southwestern quadrant indicating interaction between the nova ejecta and the ambient gas ( slavin , obrien @xmath22 dunlop 1995 , seaquist et al .",
    "furthermore , the remnant is detected with the very large array ( vla ) at 1.49 @xmath22 4.86 ghz as a non - thermal , polarized radio source with a spectral index of -0.67 and a flux of 24 mjy at 1 ghz ( reynolds @xmath22 chevalier 1984 ) .",
    "in addition , the flux densities are 8.7 , 20.6 , 29 , 33 and 38 mjy at frequencies 4.86 , 1.49 , 0.608 , 0.408 and 0.327 ghz , respectively ( biermann , strom , @xmath22 falcke 1995 ) .",
    "this shows the existence of shocked circumstellar or interstellar material .",
    "the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) observations at 60@xmath23 m and 100@xmath23 m reveal a symmetric far - ir emission region extending around the nova out to 6 pc ( 17@xmath24 either side ) suggested to be an ancient planetary nebulae associated with the binary ( bode et al .",
    "1987 ; bode , obrien , @xmath22 simpson 2004 ) .",
    "recent optical wavelength observations of the vicinity of gk per show that some of this symmetric nebulosity is produced during the quiescent mass - loss phase of the central binary because of the evolved nature of the secondary ( tweedy 1995 ) .",
    "more recent ir observations also indicate that the ir emission within 17@xmath24 of the source is of material originating from the secondary ( dougherty et al .",
    "scott , rawlings , @xmath22 evans ( 1994 ) have discovered symmetric blobs of co emission bracketing the central object at about @xmath25 200 arc seconds .",
    "overall , it is widely believed that the gk per nebula behaves like a young supernova remnant ( snr ) in the pre - sedov phase interacting with its dense circumstellar medium .",
    "classical novae are a subset of cataclysmic variables which are interacting binary systems hosting a main - sequence secondary ( sometimes a slightly evolved star ) and a collapsed primary component , a white dwarf ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "an outburst on the surface of the white dwarf as a result of a thermonuclear runaway in the accreted material causes the ejection of 10@xmath26 to 10@xmath27 m@xmath12 of material at velocities up to several thousand kilometers per second ( shara 1989 ; livio 1994 ; starrfield 2001 ) .",
    "though there has been no previous detection of old classical nova remnants in the x - ray wavelengths ( evolving like supernova remnants ) , classical nova remnants have been detected in the hard x - rays ( above 1 kev ) as a result of wind - wind interactions _ in the outburst stage _",
    "( balman et .",
    "al . 1998 ; mukai @xmath22 ishida 2001 ; orio et al . 2001 ; ness et al . 2003 ) . in general",
    ", the hard x - ray radiation above 1 kev emitted from the hot shocked gas in nova remnants should be a powerful diagnostic for the nature of mass - loss mechanisms in classical nova outbursts together with the morphology , the elemental abundances and the evolution of nova shells .",
    "a long - sought insight into this issue has been gained with the discovery of the remnant old shell of classical nova persei ( 1901 ) in the x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray shell around gk per was first discovered in a 50 ksec exposure with the rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) ( balman @xmath22 gelman 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray nebula extended to 46@xmath28 southwest , 60@xmath28 northwest , 52@xmath28 southeast , and 43@xmath28 northeast of the point source with an elliptical shape and lumpy morphology .",
    "the count rate of the shell was found as 0.01@xmath250.001 c s@xmath5 .",
    "the estimated spectral parameters of the nova shell were : n@xmath9 @xmath14 1.3@xmath250.3@xmath29 @xmath4 , and kt @xmath14 0.16@xmath250.03 kev ( @xmath142@xmath30 k ) .",
    "the implied unabsorbed x - ray flux was f@xmath31 @xmath14 3.0@xmath32 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 with l@xmath31 @xmath14 8.0@xmath33 erg s@xmath5 ( 470 pc ) .",
    "in general , what was detected by the rosat hri were the condensations in the shell .",
    "since the rosat hri did not have any adequate spectral resolution , a advanced ccd spectrometer ( acis ) observation was proposed .    in this paper ,",
    "i present the characteristics of the spectrum , its components , and the detailed morphology of the shell .",
    "finally , i discuss the results in comparison with the observations in the other wavelengths together with their implications on the novae theory and evolution of the classical nova shells .",
    "gk per and its vicinity is observed using the ( weisskopf , odell , @xmath22 van speybroeck 1996 ) advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al .",
    "2000 ) for a 95 ksec on 2000 february 10 , pointed 1 arc minute offset from the nominal point on s3 ( the back - illuminated ccd ) with no gratings in use yielding a moderate non - dispersive energy resolution .",
    "the data are obtained at the faint mode .",
    "has two focal - plane cameras and two sets of transmission gratings that can be inserted in the optical path ( hetg and letg ; high and low energy transmission gratings ) .",
    "the acis is used either to take high resolution images with moderate spectral resolution or is used as a read out device for the transmission gratings .",
    "acis is comprised of two ccd arrays , a 4-chip array , acis - i ( four front - illuminated ccds ) ; and a 6-chip array , acis - s ( four front - illuminated and two back - illuminated ccds ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of acis arrays varies depending on the type of ccd in use , front or back illuminated ccds , and the row numbers in the given ccd as a function of distance from the read out node or the aim point .",
    "the acis - s3 has a moderate spectral resolution e/@xmath34e @xmath14 10 - 30 ( falls to about 7 below 1 kev ) with an unprecedented angular resolution of 0@xmath28.49 per pixel ( half - power diameter ) .",
    "the x - ray center ( cxc ) has carried out the standard pipeline processing on the raw acis events , producing an aspect - corrected , bias - subtracted , graded ( limited to grade 02346 ) and gain - calibrated event list ( revision 2 data ) . in order to double",
    "check the standard processing , `` acis process events '' thread is used to calibrate the level 1 data using the necessary gain and `` fef '' files with the aid of ciao 3.1 and the suitable caldb ( v.2.27 - 28 ) .",
    "the data analysis is performed with ciao version 2.1 , 2.2 in the preliminary conference proceedings balman ( 2002a , b ) and in this paper with versions 2.3 and 3.1 along with xspec version 11.2.0/11.3.0 and ximage version 4.0 for data preparation , spectral and spatial analysis .",
    "prior to the analysis , the data are also filtered from the effects of the random flaring that occur during the observations with the acis - s by excluding events that are 3@xmath35 above the mean count rate in the light curve which reduced the exposure time to about 81 ksec after cleaning .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the data could be found in balman ( 2002a , b ) .",
    "observatory provides good spatial resolution data with high sensitivity thus , an 81 ksec observation provides an excellent opportunity to detect faint x - ray sources in the given region of the sky . to utilize this ,",
    "the celldetect algorithm ( harnden et al . 1984 ) is used to detect sources in the whole field image . as a result",
    ", 16 new x - ray sources are detected over 6@xmath36 confidence level above the background ( kpc - yolda @xmath22 balman 2002 ) .",
    "most of the sources are found as possible extragalactic sources .",
    "some of them could also be a galactic cataclysmic variable , a low - mass x - ray binary or a cooling neutron star .",
    "the bright x - ray nebula extends to 52@xmath28 south , 41@xmath28 north , 45@xmath28 west , and 38@xmath28 east of the point source with an irregular shape , most counts coming from a region centered at the sw .",
    "the count rate from the vicinity of the shell is 0.10@xmath250.01 c s@xmath5 .",
    "the count rate ratio of the hemisphere centered around ne to the one centered on the sw is 2:3 .",
    "figure 1 displays an exposure corrected image of the nebula between 0.3 and 10 kev obtained with the acis - s ( s3 ) .",
    "the acis transfer streak is cleaned and the pileup psf of the central source is removed from the raw image . the central source ( the binary system )",
    "is extracted by modeling a two - dimensional psf normalized to 1.65 c s@xmath5 ( i.e. , similar to the source count rate without pileup ) using chart and marx ( version 4.08 ) ( see also section 4.1 and 4.2 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows emission from the shell that is 2@xmath36 above the background with a resolution of 0@xmath28.5 per pixel .",
    "a variable smoothing is applied on the image using a gaussian of @xmath36=0@xmath28.5 - 1@xmath28 .",
    "the shell is not well developed with an average surface brightness of ( 4.9@xmath252.9)@xmath37 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 arsec@xmath38 .",
    "the x - ray nebula shows complex lumped morphology with structure ( eg .",
    ", clump / blob / filament ) sizes constrained by the smoothing performed on the image @xmath14 1@xmath28- 2@xmath28 .",
    "large scale features could be collections of smaller clumps / blobs or arcs and filaments which indicate radial elongations .",
    "it has a central circular region brighter on the western side and there is a rather faint conical emission region more extended compared with the central brighter part ( see section 6 ) .",
    "since the observation was the first detection of the spectrum of such a nebulosity around a classical nova , several different models were tested on the data to understand the characteristics .",
    "the search showed that no single model could be fitted to the spectrum of the entire shell with a @xmath39 better than 8 .",
    "the spectrum of the entire nova shell showed a thermal plasma emission below 2 kev .",
    "the harder x - ray tail of the spectrum above 2 kev was also best fitted with a thermal plasma emission model .",
    "equilibrium or non - equilibrium ionization models yielded similar fits .",
    "a power law model was ruled out for the spectrum of the entire remnant because of the non - physical spectral indices derived from the results in contrast with the non - thermal ( synchrotron emission ) nature of the radio data ( balman 2002a ) .",
    "the spectrum was remarkably flat above 2 kev .",
    "figure 2 shows the best fitted two - component emission model of vmekal ( mewe , gronenschild @xmath22 van den oord 1985 ; liedahl et al .",
    "1995 ) + pshock ( borkowski et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the shell photons were extracted using an annulus with an inner radius of 12@xmath28.5 and an outer radius of 67@xmath28.5 .",
    "the background was also derived from an annular region farther out around the nova normalized to the source extraction region .",
    "the spectrum was calculated using a minimum of 50 counts per bin and the channels below 0.3 kev and above 9 kev were excluded due to low statistics .",
    "the spectral parameters that were derived from the fits to the second component resulted in a very high shock temperature in excess of 50 kev and shock speed larger than 5000 km s@xmath5 which were inconsistent with all the measurements in the other wavelengths .",
    "this problem was largely due to the excess photon contribution from the wings of the psf of the piled - up central source .",
    "such a contaminating component resulted in significantly higher temperature and flux for the second component above 2 kev , and shifts in the central line energies ( toward lower energies ) of the lower temperature component below 2 kev .",
    "this excess emission compared with the observed psf of the central source also needed to be properly cleaned in order to study the image of the shell .",
    "sections ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) describe the problem and the procedure / method used to clean and remove this effect of the psf wings from the shell data ( i.e , images and spectra ) .",
    "pileup results in the ccds when two or more photons are detected as a single event .",
    "the consequences are spectral hardening since apparent energy is approximately the sum of two ( or more ) energies and underestimation of the true counting rate of the point sources .",
    "it is expected that pileup problem also distorts the psf of the central source by creating holes at the centers ( pulse saturation ) and the psf wings become more prominent as the count rates increase . as a result , appreciable central source counts can be detected in a region within 2@xmath24 of the pointed source .",
    "this contaminates any extended emission in the close vicinity of the central source .",
    "the source photons of gk per has a pileup of about 89@xmath40 where one expects the emission from the shell to be affected by the pileup psf and the prominent psf wings . in order to exclude the spectrum of the central source , gk per ,",
    "the nova shell photons are extracted from an annular region of 12@xmath28.5 to 67@xmath28.5 in radius ( as presented in sec 4.0 ) .",
    "this should largely avoid the contamination from the piled - up central source , but it will be inefficient to exclude the effects of the prominent psf wings beyond 12@xmath28.5 out to 67@xmath28.5 in radius . to segregate the counts of the nova shell from the central source counts in the wings of the psf ( at the vicinity of the nova shell ) ,",
    "an archival search within the acis - s pointings ( no grating or hetg observations ) has been performed .",
    "the prime motivation of the search has been to measure the count rate in the psf wings in an annular region of 12@xmath28.5 out to 67@xmath28.5 radius in comparison with the count rate in a circular region of 12@xmath28.5 .",
    "the particular extraction radii is assumed only to compare the gk per observation with other archival observations .",
    "the two different regions assumed are designated as : ( 1 ) the _ source _ defined as the circular photon extraction region of 12@xmath28.5 radius ( 25 pixels ) , and ( 2 ) the _ shell _ defined as the annular photon extraction region of 12@xmath28.5 to 67@xmath28.5 in radius .",
    "the count rates within the _ source _ and _ shell _ regions are compared for several observations so that an acceptable estimate of the count rate in the wings of the psf can be made for the central source of gk per in the vicinity of the nova shell given the central source count rate of gk per ( pileup rate ) .",
    "over 300 archival data of _ pointed sources _ on the acis - s array have been analyzed imposing several criteria : ( 1 ) energy spectrum of the source peaks about 1 - 2 kev and have a hard x - ray tail , ( 2 ) pointings are within a region of 2@xmath24 of the nominal point on acis s-3 , ( 3 ) all observations have the same frame time of 3.2 sec and obtained in the faint mode , ( 4 ) no special spatial filtering has been performed during the observation for pileup mitigation , ( 5 ) hetg observations with bright first order data have also been excluded , ( 6 ) observations with pileup count rates brighter than a few c / s ( i.e. 3 c / s ) are also excluded since the scaling relation is altered , ( 7 ) observations that show strong background flares and anomalous high background rates have been disregarded . as a result , about 15 suitable pointings have been recovered that fits all the criteria .",
    "figure 3a shows the count rate in a region of 12@xmath28.5 radius ( 25 pixels ) , the _ source _ , versus the count rate in an annular region of 12@xmath28.5 to 67@xmath28.5 in radius , the _ shell _ , both centered at the point source .",
    "finally , a scaling relation between the count rates in two different regions described as the _ source _ and _ shell _ is derived .",
    "the curve in figure 3a is best fitted by the quadratic function , ax@xmath21+bx+c , where a=-0.12@xmath250.09 , b=1.11@xmath250.14 , and c=-0.18@xmath250.03 .",
    "this has been used to approximate the count rate in the psf wings of gk per within the region covered by the classical nova shell .",
    "for a _ source _ count rate of 0.2 c s@xmath5 ( pileup rate ) , the estimated count rate in the psf wings ( _ shell _ region ) within the classical nova shell is 0.037 c s@xmath5 , which yields an actual nova shell count rate around 0.063 c s@xmath5 ( instead of 0.1 c s@xmath5 ) .",
    "this is also checked using an archival acis - s hetg data of gk per obtained during a dwarf nova outburst .",
    "the zeroth order pileup source count rate is used to estimate the count rate in the described shell with the aid of the derived scaling relation ( same extraction radii is assumed ) .",
    "considering that a lower frame time , and spatial clipping are used to mitigate the pileup to some extend and that the source is in outburst , the scaling function yields similar results .",
    "i would like to note that the contamination problem described here could be important for acis observations of other astrophysical objects like galaxies / clusters and centrally filled composite snrs .    in order to remove the central source from the image of the nova shell of gk per together with the prominent psf wings ,",
    "a psf is created using chart .",
    "several psfs are merged to achieve the correct count rate within the nova shell region ( i.e. , 0.037 c s@xmath5 in the psf wings ) .",
    "the final central source count rate of the combined psf in the _ source _ region is close to the count rate ( within 8@xmath40 ) of the central source , gk per , when there is no pileup ( 1.7 - 1.8 c s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the un - piled central source rate is calculated using an archival asca data of gk per ( i.e. , spectrum ) and pimms .",
    "next , the combined psf is extracted from the total image to achieve figure 1 .",
    "the central source , gk per , has 89@xmath40 pileup and has about 0.037 c s@xmath5 in the region of the x - ray shell due to its prominent psf wings .",
    "thus , this will also affect the `` entire nova shell spectrum '' where the spectrum of the central source will be appearing as a component of the nova shell spectrum of gk per as a result of the counts in the psf wings .",
    "i would like to note that though gk per has a dusty environment , previous x - ray observations with several different satellites have not recovered any dust scattering halo around the source which could have affected the emission below 1 kev .",
    "the result of the analysis presented in section ( 4.1 ) , for the sources which suffer from the pileup effect on acis - s3 , indicates that the spectra derived from the _ shell _ regions ( as denoted in section [ 4.1 ] ) , basically from the psf wings , may be better approximated with the spectra derived from the _ source _ regions , but scaled down .",
    "this is only because the spectral shapes resemble each other , and not that the spectra from the psf wings have pileup photons ( as in the _ source _ regions ) .",
    "theoretically , pileup in the psf wings should either be non - existent or very small , however the spectra from the psf wings may show spectral hardening .",
    "figure 3b shows a collection of spectra of the sources used for calibration where the above assumptions can be clearly investigated .",
    "the upper curves represent the _ source_-region spectra and the lower curves represent the _ shell_-region spectra ( spectra obtained from the psf wings ) .",
    "the sources have very similar pileup source count rates to gk per in the stated _ source _ extraction region 0.19 - 0.21 c s@xmath5 ( more or less similar central source spectra with a hard x - ray tail - three objects are other cvs ) . in order to remove the spectrum of the psf wings of the central source from the nova shell spectrum ,",
    "first a spectrum ( of gk per ) is extracted from a circular region of radius 12@xmath28.5 ( _ source_-region ) .",
    "this spectrum is fitted with a composite model of photoelectric absorption , bremsstrahlung and power law models .",
    "the best fit parameters are used to recalculate / rescale this spectrum using both marx and webspec yielding a count rate of 0.037 c s@xmath5 .",
    "the parameters used to model this _ source_-region spectrum are an n@xmath9 of 1.16@xmath2010@xmath41 , a covering fraction of 0.95 , a kt of 13.3 kev , a bremsstrahlung normalization of 5.54@xmath2010@xmath42 , a photon index of 2.5 and a power law normalization of 7.93@xmath2010@xmath27 .",
    "figure 4 shows the central source spectrum of gk per derived from the _ source_-region ( upper curve ) , the modeled spectrum to be subtracted ( middle curve ) , and the un - piled central source spectrum of gk per ( lower curve ) .",
    "the un - piled source spectrum is extracted from the out - of - time events of the acis transfer streak .",
    "i want to point out that all three data sets in figure 4 are consistent with one another and the un - piled source spectrum can be approximated with the modeled spectrum to an acceptable extend . finally , the modeled spectrum ( middle curve ) is subtracted pi channel by pi channel from the nova shell spectrum of gk per .",
    "figure 5a shows the resulting total nova shell spectrum after removing the spectrum of the psf wings of the central source , gk per .",
    "the total number of nova shell photons between 0.3 - 1.6 kev is 4675 and between 1.6 - 8.0 kev is 410 after removal of the background and the photons from the wings of the central source psf .",

    "an elaboration of this scenario is in section [ 7.1 ] .",
    "the nebula displays a different structure compared with the broad band image at the emission line energy detected around 0.907 kev .",
    "the ne ix emission line image shows a symmetric cone - like shape centered at the sw direction ( see figure 8) and the flattening on the sw is more prominent .",

    "this continuum image , also , subtracts out any central source photons since it includes both the source and the shell continuum in the channel range .",
    "i need to note that some of the line emission and diffuse neon emission could have been lost in this process , but figure 8 is a cleaned image .",
    "both of the line and continuum images are regrouped by two pixels and smoothed by a gaussian of @xmath35=2@xmath28 before subtraction .",
    "the resolution of the final image ( continuum subtracted ) is 1@xmath28 per pixel and shows emission from the shell that is 2@xmath35 above the background . the neon image of the shell clearly reveals a cone , a one sided shell ( i.e. , hemisphere ) , where the remnant rams into a wall like structure and is compressed in that direction .",
    "the image also shows a very lumpy morphology with clump sizes limited by the resolution of the image @xmath14 2@xmath28 .",
    "the size of the cut - cone is @xmath14 63@xmath28 in the flattened zone and @xmath14 112@xmath28 -116@xmath28 in the wings toward the north and east in the image . assuming 99 years for the elapsed time and a linear expansion law , the velocities required to create the wings are @xmath14 2600 - 2800 km s@xmath5 and the flattened zone is @xmath14 1100 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the high velocity necessary for creation of the `` wings '' detected in the ne ix image are more than twice the expansion speed of the nova shell detected in the other wavelengths and about the same in the sw region which is the flattened zone .",
    "this shows that the ejecta material is mixed in the forward shock . using the extensions above and the law of cosines ,",
    "the cone angle is calculated to be @xmath14 74@xmath70 .",
    "the axis of the cone is in the same direction with the axis of the polar cones attributed from the material lying in the light - echo region ( seaquist et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the reverse shock regions are prone to formation of knots because of rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "the width of the interaction region between the forward and reverse shocks shrinks considerably with increasing compression ratio ( due to existence of nonlinear diffusive particle acceleration ) and the convective instabilities can reach all the way into the forward shock . as a result , clumps and filaments can be found in the vicinity of the forward shock region . for low compression ratios , any enhancement of the radial magnetic field could play the same role and rayleigh - taylor instabilities can still extend all the way into the shock front ( see also blondin @xmath22 ellison 2001 for a discussion ) .",
    "this explains the existence of knots of emission ( neon knots ) in the forward shock zone of gk per and also mixing of the ejecta material into the forward shock .",
    "however , this does not necessarily account for the large asymmetry detected in the remnant .",
    "therefore , a contributing factor to the above argument for the structure in the emission line would be the existence of undecelerated , cool and dense neon knots in the shell that have caught up with the forward shock and surpassed it in se and nw directions where the interstellar density is low .",
    "such a phenomenon was also suggested for the knots in cas a , vela , cygnus loop and others .",
    "the se - nw direction is also the site for the reflection nebula , the symmetric far - ir emission nebulosity , and suggested to be a region of low density ( lawrence et al .",
    "1995 ; tweedy 1995 ; bode et al . 1987 ; seaquist et al . 1989 ) .",
    "this is also supported by the co map of the vicinity of the nova which shows a relatively empty environment toward the north and east of the nova and a prominent co emission toward the south ( hessman 1989 ; scott et al .",
    "1994 ) . moreover , detected neon clumps could be formed at an early stage in the eruption of the nova and matter could be ejected as knots in high velocity winds during the early outburst stage ( shore et al .",
    "this also implies a binary orientation origin for the asymmetry in the remnant together with the non - uniform density profile of the circumstellar medium around the nova .",
    "in addition to the ne ix emission line image , other possible emission line images were constructed at around 0.58 kev ( o vii line ) and 0.43 kev ( n vi line ) .",

    "they are also corrected for the contamination caused by the acis transfer streak and the psf wings as described in sec .",
    "all three bands indicate different structure .",
    "the first two bands ( up to 1.5 kev ; figure 9a , b ) show generally a filled semi - circular structure brighter on the western side with the brightest zone at the flattened rim which is more evident in the second band .",
    "this resembles the structure of the total band image ( see figure 1 ) except for the `` wing '' structure detected predominantly in the neon emission line ( seen also in the second band image ) .",
    "the second band image is more cone - like owing largely to the motion of the neon knots as described in the previous paragraphs .",
    "the third band ( hardest x - rays ) image is partially resolved ( detected spectrally in sec .",
    "the original discovery of the x - ray nebula of gk per was also at a resolution of low significance with the rosat hri between 0.2 - 2.4 kev ( see figure 1 in balman @xmath22 gelman 1999 ) .",

    "part of this elliptical emission zone is also the region where the peak spectrum is derived and the non - thermal x - ray emission is detected .",
    "the different structures in the three different energy bands support that the x - ray emission from the shell of gk per has different components .      in order to investigate the conditions within the shell and determine the evolutionary stage of the remnant , spectral and spatial comparisons in different wavelengths are necessary . detailed results from the recent data on gk per are not available .",
    "however , a preliminary comparison of the x - ray image has been made by _ aligning _ the image with the recent images obtained in the optical and radio wavelengths .",
    "figure 10a shows the x - ray image and an overlay of contours derived from the hst image obtained with the [ nii ] filter ( brightest emission line in the optical wavelengths ) ( hst   knots and filaments are in general coincident with the central circular region of the x - ray nebula , not with the `` wings '' detected predominantly in the ne ix image ( see also figure 9 ) .",
    "both images do not show a well developed shell and are brighter on the western hemisphere rather than the east .",
    "this is not an effect of the x - ray absorption since the spectral fits do not yield significant variation in the n@xmath9 parameter in different directions within the nebula .",
    "in general , the [ nii ] image is larger toward the sw of the nova which indicates cooling in the forward shock and that the remnant has evolved in comparison with the aligned images in seaquist et al .",
    "the optical shell , mostly composed of knots and filaments , suggests large - scale density gradients in the vicinity of the classical nova .",
    "though the contours look circular in geometry , the hst data indicates an elliptical velocity gradient in the shell with the fastest material lying in the nw to se direction ( shara 2002 , private communication ) , which is the direction the elongation in the x - ray nebula lies , as detected in the image of the ne ix line and figure 9b .",
    "since there is x - ray emission both from the reverse and forward shocks , the line emission in the uv and optical wavelengths coming from within the shell and the pre - shock zone should be affected by the ionization due to x - ray irradiation ( i.e. , particularly , the luminosity and evolution of the h@xmath98 emission line ; chevalier @xmath22 fransson 1994 ; chevalier @xmath22 oishi 2003 ) . the [ oiii ] emission line is a characteristics of the shock zones in circumstellar interaction , however the [ oiii ] emission from the shell is weak and mostly suppressed in the sw region where the x - ray emission is the brightest ( seaquist et al .",
    "1989 ; slavin et al .",
    ". this could be because the expanding shell is stopped very efficiently and the shock speeds are low in this region ( shifting the emission to nii and h@xmath98 lines ) .",
    "the densities of the optical knots in the sw are also detected to be high in comparison with the ones in the ne , se and nw , thus the prominent emission lines are that of [ nii ] and h@xmath98 ( seaquist et al .",

    "the image of the x - ray nebula has been aligned also with a recent vla image obtained at 1.425 ghz in 1997 ( vla   emission , see also balman 2002a ) .",
    "the flattening on the sw is evident in both images .",
    "an intriguing result of this combination image is that the peak of the non - thermal radio emission falls slightly offset toward inside of the shell from the brightest x - ray region ( x - ray peak of the nova shell ) .",
    "this indicates that the particle acceleration could be occurring at the reverse shock zone consistent with the high absorption associated with the non - thermal x - ray component ( see section 5.0 ) .",
    "in addition , the outer ridge of the radio shell falls in the x - ray bright zone , as well .",
    "an example similar to this has been detected in the observation of the young supernova remnant 1e 0102.2 - 7219 ( gaetz et al .",
    "moreover , in figure 10b the radio wavelength contours show a trace of the `` wings '' at a 1.5@xmath35 confidence level ( figure 8 , see also the second band image in figure 9 ) .",
    "the part of the radio wavelength ( 1.425 ghz ) image associated with the `` wings '' seems to be a part of a much larger and fainter emission which may not be associated directly with the shell , but the circumstellar / interstellar environment of the nova .",

    "the content of the radio spectrum along the `` neon wings '' is at this time unknown .",
    "in general , the observation of the shell of nova persei ( 1901 ) has revealed that the remnant evolves similar to the young supernova remnants expanding into its circumstellar medium , a leftover wind ejecta expelled in the course of the binary evolution , and a co enhanced interstellar medium in the vicinity ( similar to type ii snrs : chevalier @xmath22 fransson 1994 hereafter cf94 ; see also truelove and mckee 1999 for a general review ) .",
    "a conspicuous interpretation of the spectrum of the nova shell is such that the origin of the emission below 2 kev is partly of the ejecta ( e.g. , ne and n emission lines ) and the circumstellar matter , namely the forward shock ( also the transition zone ) , whereas the emission above 2 kev is of the reverse shock region ( owing to the absorption by high equivalent neutral column density ) .",
    "there is significant difference ( 3@xmath35 ) between the neutral hydrogen column densities of the two components of the nova shell spectrum .",
    "this could be explained in the context of snr evolution where such a cool layer may exist between the forward and the reverse shocks in the early phases .",
    "the size ( @xmath34r ) of this cold shell is less than 5@xmath99 cm ( less than 0.0005 arc seconds at 470 pc distance ) for an snr 100 years old ( cf94 ) , with a range of density 2@xmath100 to 3@xmath60 @xmath13 ( cf94 ) .",

    "the size of an snr at the same evolutionary age with gk per is larger by a factor of 20 at the least .",
    "thus , time may disperse a cool shell between the forward and reverse shocks in snrs of high velocities and large sizes , but , since gk per is considerably slower ( compared with an snr 100 years old ) and more compact with respect to an snr at the same evolutionary age , this cool absorbing layer could stay intact . moreover , the size of gk per is equivalent to an snr a few years old . in such cases ,",
    "a distinct cool layer is likely ( if the reverse shock is radiative ) and the emission from the reverse shock would be absorbed .",
    "the high x - ray absorption detected for the shell of gk per between 0.5 - 2 kev is not largely due to the neutral hydrogen , but to the neutral metals owing to the fact that the absorbing layer is the cooled part of the reverse shock / ejecta itself .",
    "the composition of the ejecta is enhanced in metal abundances of n , ne and possibly o. even the circumstellar wind material is at least of solar composition .",
    "the absorptivity per hydrogen atom greatly increases above 0.1 kev due to the existence of metals like n , o , ne , and fe of solar abundances ( wilms , allen @xmath22 mccray 2000 and references therein ) which would yield large equivalent column densities of neutral hydrogen .",

    "the average expansion speed detected for the nova is about 1200 km s@xmath5 in the optical and uv wavelengths ( see also sec 1 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the values obtained by measuring the size of the x - ray nebula in the sw direction ( see section 6.0 ) , but inconsistent with the speeds calculated for nw and se directions ( see section 6.0 ) .",

    "the nova shell of gk per is a site where energetic electrons are produced by diffusive shock acceleration ( particle acceleration ) confirmed by the observation via the discovery of the synchrotron emission from the non - thermal electrons in the reverse shock zone .",
    "the detected power law emission in the x - rays reveals the same spectral index as in the radio wavelengths recovered with the fits using a srcut model of emission .",
    "the detected x - ray photon index is 2.3@xmath0 , the spectral index is 0.68@xmath2 and the unabsorbed luminosity is 4.6 @xmath76 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the remnant is age - limited .",
    "the non - thermal electron density is about 3.01@xmath143 ( f=1 ) and the efficiency of injection in the reverse shock is about 1.4@xmath143 .",
    "this value is similar to the efficiency derived for sn 1006 which is the most efficient snr in particle acceleration .",
    "however , the derived luminosity for gk per is lower because the emitting volume is smaller . the cool x - ray temperature ( 0.1 - 0.3 kev ) of the forward shock indicates that there is nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration occurring in this region , also .",
    "however , the efficiency and the luminosity is low ( l@xmath31@xmath593@xmath156 erg s@xmath5 and @xmath69@xmath622.8 ) and can not be resolved from the thermal emission .",
    "this complies with the theoretical expectations that for young snrs the contribution from particle acceleration into the energetics of the systems will be small .",
    "the calculated break frequency for the remnant shows that gk per is also a strong candidate for gamma - ray emission ( out to the knee ) due to the accelerated particles in the reverse shock region with e@xmath85 about 15 - 30 tev ( this should be more or less correct for the forward shock region , too ) .",
    "the x - ray nebula has a low temperature component ( below 2 kev ) , the first component , that is a ( non - equilibrium ionization ) thermal plasma close to ionization equilibrium , possibly dominated by emission lines , with kt@xmath14 0.1 - 0.3 kev and an x - ray luminosity @xmath14 4.3@xmath16 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "this component shows the he - like ne ix ( i.e , most contribution may be coming from a forbidden emission line ) and he - like n vi line emission derived from the spectral fits ( and a possible o vii emission line ) .",
    "no h - like line emission is detected .",
    "this component is associated with the forward shock region and the transition zone owing to the low neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "thus , it is a mixed plasma of shocked circumstellar matter and ejecta material .",
    "the electron density within this region is 0.6 - 11.2 @xmath13 ( for a filling factor of 1 ) .",
    "the n@xmath58 in the circumstellar medium is @xmath6160 @xmath13 ( n@xmath58@xmath144.1 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the higher energy component of the entire shell spectrum above 2 kev is most likely a plasma emission of bremsstrahlung origin with no resolved emission lines .",
    "the fits using a thermal bremsstrahlung model of emission reveal a shock temperature of kt = 1.04@xmath169 kev and an x - ray luminosity ( 6.6 - 0.14)@xmath67 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "it is found to be heavily absorbed with n@xmath9 = ( 4.0 - 22.0)@xmath10 @xmath4 suggesting that there is a cold layer of material between the two x - ray components and the second component is most likely originating from the shocked gas in the reverse shock zone .",
    "the x - ray analysis reveals that this cold layer is a plasma of solar abundances with n / n@xmath12@xmath1411 and ne / ne@xmath12@xmath1418 where the high metalicity of the ejecta in this cooling layer is largely responsible for the high optical depth between 0.2 and 2 kev .",
    "it is also important to note that this high column density of neutrals absorbs the emission below 1.5 kev where most of the line emission would be detected .",
    "the standard nova theory predicts enrichment of metal abundances produced prior to the outburst via mixing processes .",
    "this observation reveals for the first time a minimum enhancement of neon 13 - 21 and nitrogen 1 - 5 times its solar number fraction from a remnant in the x - rays that is 100 yrs old .",
    "moreover , the existence of enhanced neutral abundances of neon and nitrogen in the `` cold absorbing shell '' supports this finding . as a result",
    ", this confirms that the outburst was a result of a violent tnr on an onemg wd , which would , also , explain the existence of a blast wave .",
    "the high nitrogen ratio is a direct evidence of the @xmath170 unstable nuclei which must have been ejected with the blast wave from the nova in the early stages .",
    "the kinetic energy density of the ejecta is ( 0.3 - 1.5)@xmath171 erg @xmath13 where the maximum limit comes from the calculated shocked mass ( i.e. ( 2.1 - 38.5)@xmath15 m@xmath12 ) .",
    "the energy densities of the thermal plasma , magnetic field and non - thermal electrons are 5.1@xmath37 erg @xmath13 , 2.3@xmath11 erg @xmath13 and 3.0@xmath11 erg @xmath13 , respectively , implying that the magnetic field and the non - thermal electrons are almost / in equipartition at the shock zone .",
    "the energy budget of the nova remnant indicates that not all the kinetic energy has appeared as thermal energy in the shock zone , in accordance with the fact that the remnant is young .",
    "thus , considerable energy is still going into expansion of the shell and about less than 34@xmath40 appears as thermal energy with about less than 2@xmath40 in the accelerated particles .",
    "the low x - ray luminosity ( 4.3@xmath16 erg s@xmath5 ) of the forward shock indicates that the remnant is adiabatic .",
    "the reverse shock is radiative .",
    "overall , the nova shell of gk per resemble a sedov remnant ( of snrs ) .",
    "the cooling in the forward shock is also detected in the hst [ nii ] images ( very similar to h@xmath98 images ) aligned with the x - ray data ( see figure 10a ) .",
    "the nova shell of gk per remains to be unique with its characteristics over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "it behaves as a miniature snr with typical characteristics , yet it is the first detection of cnrs ( classical nova remnants ) , which can be a new class of x - ray emitters that have considerably low surface brightness / luminosity and shocked mass compared with snrs ; as a result evolving faster than , but similar to snrs .",
    "the luminosity range for such objects are between a few@xmath16 to a few@xmath172 ergs s@xmath5 as the adiabatic remnants start to cool . after the outburst of a classical nova ,",
    "the typical cooling timescale for the hard x - ray emission components due to wind - wind interactions is about three years ( balman et al .",
    "however , as the shell interacts with its circumstellar environment , it should produce about the range of luminosity above depending on how strong the shock will be ( i.e. , density contrast / compression ratio ) and how the expansion will affect the surface brightness of the remnant .",
    "two other candidates , dq her and rr pic indicate residual emission coming from the location of their shells ( mukai , still , @xmath22 ringwald 2003 ; balman 2002b ) . recovering cnrs require simultaneous high sensitivity and spatial resolution and pose a challenge given the characteristics of the present and upcoming x - ray missions .",
    "the acis detector on and epic pn on newton - xmm could discover some of the close - by and luminous cnrs .",
