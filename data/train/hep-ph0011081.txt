    "in any given supersymmetric theory , a consistent analysis of the soft terms is necessary in order to make reliable predictions .",
    "such a systematic analysis was performed at tree level by brignole , ibez and muoz @xcite some time ago for a large class of four - dimensional string models .",
    "one of the nice features of this analysis was to make explicit the dependence of the soft terms in the auxiliary field vacuum expectation values ( _ vev _",
    "s ) and thus to relate them directly to the supersymmetry breaking mechanism . in this respect , the auxiliary fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 associated respectively with the string dilaton and the moduli fields are expected to play a central role in these superstring models .",
    "this analysis showed that , besides a universal contribution associated with the dilaton field , soft terms generically receive from moduli fields a non - universal contribution which may lead to a very different phenomenology from the standard one referred to as the minimal supergravity model .",
    "recently , a new contribution to the soft supersymmetry breaking terms has been discussed under the name of `` anomaly mediated terms '' @xcite that arise at the quantum level from the superconformal anomaly .",
    "they are truly supergravity contributions in the sense that they involve the auxiliary fields of the supergravity multiplet , more precisely the complex scalar auxiliary field @xmath3 in the minimal formulation ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "however if these contributions are included , then all one - loop contributions to the soft terms should be taken into account . in what follows , we present the general form of these contributions , expressed in terms of the auxiliary fields and we discuss them for several classes of superstring models .",
    "we stress that some of the contributions depend on the way the underlying theory regulates the low energy effective field theory .",
    "in particular we find a model of anomaly mediation where the scalar masses might be non - vanishing at one loop .",
    "in this section , we give the complete expressions for the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , where @xmath4 is the gravitino mass ( typically less than 10 tev ) and @xmath5 is the renormalization scale , taken to be the scale at which supersymmetry is broken ( typically @xmath6gev or higher ) ] . let us start by introducing our notations .",
    "we consider a set of chiral superfields @xmath7 ( the associated scalar field will be denoted by @xmath8 ) which belong to two distinct classes : the first class @xmath9 denotes observable superfields charged under the gauge symmetries , the second class @xmath10 describes hidden sector fields , typically in the models that we will consider the dilaton and t and u moduli fields .",
    "their interactions are described by three functions : the khler potential @xmath11 , the superpotential @xmath12 and the gauge kinetic functions @xmath13 , one for each gauge group @xmath14 .",
