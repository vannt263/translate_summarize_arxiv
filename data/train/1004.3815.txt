    "nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) models  @xcite are schematic quark models useful as a tool to understand the physics associated with chiral symmetry and the phase structure in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "njl types of model are extensively used in studies related to nuclear astrophysics , such as the ones concerning neutron and quark stars , while sophisticated versions of the model are also employed to study color superconducting phases in deconfined quark matter in attempts to unveil the qcd phase diagram ( for njl model reviews , both at zero and at finite temperature and density , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since the model does not include gluon degrees of freedom and thus can not be used to study confinement , its use is more suitable for the study of the low - temperature regime of qcd and quark matter , where the physics of confinement is less important .",
    "however , in this regime the strong - coupling and nonperturbative nature of the nuclear matter becomes relevant .",
    "many studies using njl - type of models have restricted themselves to the use of the large-@xmath2 ( ln ) limit ( where @xmath2 is the number of colors ) , which is also equivalent to the hartree approximation  @xcite .",
    "although a number of investigations of higher - order corrections beyond the hartree approximation have been carried out in the past ( see , e.g. , @xcite in particular for the next - to - leading @xmath1 calculations ) , these studies are in general technically involved and not obvious , and they may open new issues . typically , because of the intrinsic non - renormalisability of the model , going to higher orders requires in general the introduction of new parameters , sometimes making the conclusion and comparison with simpler ln results to depend on extra parameters .",
    "it is thus of interest to examine alternative methods able to go beyond mean - field approximations , to determine how they perform as compared to the ln approximation , and whether they provide both qualitatively and quantitatively relevant corrections to the large-@xmath2 constraint .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest @xmath0 version of the njl model that will be exploited beyond the ln limit , or mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , by means of the optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) . the opt method ( which also goes by different names , or has many variants ,",
    "e.g. `` delta - expansion ''  @xcite , order - dependent mapping  @xcite , etc ) is notorious for allowing evaluations beyond the mfa because of the way it modifies the ordinary perturbative expansion , giving a nontrivial ( nonperturbative ) coupling dependence . in particular , in models with an @xmath3 or @xmath4 symmetry , an important part of next - to - leading @xmath5 corrections are captured at first opt order , although it is basically a different approximation scheme than the @xmath5 expansion , while corrections belonging formally to higher @xmath5 order are also partly included . in",
    "the few studied models where perturbative orders are available at high orders , the opt turns out to improve substantially the convergence of ordinary perturbation , resumming the latter to some extent , and providing convergent sequences of approximations to some nonperturbative results .",
    "examples of successful applications include the precise determination of the critical temperature for weakly interacting dilute bose gases  @xcite , phase diagrams for scalar theories  @xcite , gross - neveu ( gn ) types of model  @xcite and yukawa theories  @xcite , as well as the recent precise determination of critical dopant concentration in polyacetylene  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the precise location of the tricritical point and the mixed liquid - gas phase within the gn model in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite illustrates how this method can be a powerful tool beyond standard perturbation theory , since these important effects were missed by the mfa and could not be precisely determined by monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "moreover in the @xmath3 gn model it has been shown very recently  @xcite that a percentage level of accuracy can be reached already at first opt and @xmath5-expansion order , when in this case the relevant renormalization group dependence is incorporated .",
    "the method has also been recently applied with success to the study of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "finally , closer to njl model considerations , the opt approach has been applied in the past directly to the full qcd lagrangian ( at zero temperature ) , in a way consistent with renormalization , obtaining , for instance , estimations of the quark condensate and pion decay constant in the chiral symmetry limit  @xcite .    the opt version adopted here is mainly indicated to nongauge theories , which ( at finite temperature ) require the method to be extended , for example , by adding and subtracting a hard - thermal - loop improvement that modifies the propagators and vertices in a self - consistent way , in the so - called hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory ( htlpt )  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the opt method , as applied at first order to the simplest version of the njl model , does not introduce new effective parameters beyond those present in the standard mft or ln picture , while providing at the same time nontrivial corrections beyond ln approximation .",
    "applying the opt to the njl model actually provides a rather complete description of the thermodynamics of the model , showing how corrections beyond ln change known results at that level of approximation .",
    "this allows to pinpoint how important these corrections may be in providing a reliable description for the model . by studying different thermodynamical quantities , like the trace anomaly , specific heat and quark susceptibility",
    ", we are also able to understand how useful these quantities might be as indicators for precise location of the critical points in the phase diagram , a topic of most interest today in the context of quark - gluon phase transition and heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the basic features of the two - flavor njl model . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss how the opt has to be implemented within this model . in sec .",
    "iv we evaluate the landau s free energy density and its optimization is performed to the first nontrivial order in the opt . in sec .",
    "v we establish the validity of the goldstone theorem at this opt order , and derive all necessary expressions to rederive a consistent set of basic vacuum njl parameters matched to the pion mass and decay constant . in sec .",
    "vi we present a series of numerical results that are relevant at various regimes of temperature and/or density .",
    "the phase diagram of the njl model , as well as many relevant thermodynamical quantities , are further explored and compared with the corresponding ln approximation results .",
    "our conclusions and perspectives are presented in sec .",
    "two appendixes are included to give some relevant technical expressions and details of our calculations .",
    "the njl model is described by a lagrangian density for fermionic fields given by  @xcite    @xmath6 ,    \\label{njl2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 ( a sum over flavors and color degrees of freedom is implicit ) represents a flavor isodoublet ( @xmath8 types of quarks ) @xmath9-plet quark fields , while @xmath10 are isospin pauli matrices . the lagrangian density ( [ njl2 ] ) is invariant under ( global ) @xmath11 and , when @xmath12 , the theory is also invariant under chiral @xmath13 .",

    "( [ njl2 ] ) is also allowed by the chiral symmetry and such a term can become important at finite densities , generating a saturation mechanism depending on the vector coupling strength that provides better matter stability . within the ln approximation ( or mfa ) , the effect of such a term in the thermodynamical potential is to produce a shift on the chemical potential . however",
    ", this term will not be considered here .    due to the quadratic fermionic interaction , the theory is nonrenormalizable in 3 + 1 dimensions ( @xmath15 has dimensions of @xmath16 ) , meaning that divergences appearing at successive perturbative orders can not be all eliminated by a consistent redefinition of the original model parameters ( fields , masses , and couplings ) .",
    "the renormalizability issue arises during the evaluation of momentum integrals associated with loop feynman graphs in a perturbative expansion and , in the process , one usually employs regularization prescriptions ( e.g. dimensional regularization , sharp cutoff , etc ) to formally isolate divergences .",
    "however , the procedure introduces _",
    "arbitrary _ parameters with dimensions of energy that do not appear in the _ original _ lagrangian density . within the njl model a sharp cut off ( @xmath17 )",
    "is preferred and since the model is nonrenomalizable , one has to fix @xmath17 to a value related to the physical spectrum under investigation .",
    "this strategy turns the 3 + 1 njl model into an effective model , where @xmath17 is treated as a parameter , as usual in effective nonrenormalizable field theory models .",
    "the experimental values of quantities such as the pion mass ( @xmath18 ) and the pion decay constant @xmath19 are used to fix both , @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "an interesting alternative regarding regularization within the njl model is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where explicit evaluation of divergent integrals is avoided by assuming in intermediate steps only general symmetry properties of the regularization , such that the finite parts are integrated in a way independent of the regularization ) .",
    "a second important issue regards the fact that , when @xmath20 , the quark propagator brings unwanted infrared divergences , meaning that the evaluations have to be carried out in a _ nonperturbative _ fashion .",
    "moreover , very often physical quantities ( like the self - energy ) appear as powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath21 , which is greater than unity , preventing any possibility of calculations via standard perturbative methods .    in analytic nonperturbative evaluations",
    ", one can consider one - loop contributions dressed by a fermionic propagator , whose effective mass , @xmath22 , is determined in a self - consistent way .",
    "this approximation is known under different names , for example , the hartree , ln or mean - field approximation . to obtain the effective potential ( or landau free energy density ) , @xmath23 , for the quarks",
    ", it is convenient to consider the bosonized version of the njl , which is easily obtained by introducing auxiliary fields ( @xmath24 ) through a hubbard - stratonovich type of transformation . here",
    ", @xmath25 is evaluated using the ln approximation , which is equivalent to the mfa .",
    "then , to introduce the auxiliary bosonic fields and to render the theory more suitable for use of the ln approximation , it is convenient to use @xmath26 and to formally treat @xmath9 as a large number , which is set to the relevant value , @xmath27 , at the end of the evaluations .",

    "\\label{delta12}\\ ] ]    in order to discuss issues related to chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) and goldstone s theorem , it is useful to temporarily consider the chiral limit of the original theory by setting @xmath12 .",
    "note then that the actual chiral limit and original lagrangian is recovered for @xmath36 , and that @xmath37 at this stage is an arbitrary mass parameter , as usual in the opt method .",
    "now , a well - established result concerning the opt evaluation of the free energy density ( or effective potential ) , @xmath23 , in the ln limit , shows that @xmath38 becomes exactly the classical value of the background fields , so that both approximations coincide in this limit .",

    "( [ delta12 ] ) , the njl becomes analogous to the gn model , displaying discrete csb . in this case , numerous applications show that , when considering the ln limit , we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "however , within the njl model , apart from the scalar channel , one also has to deal with the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "this situation was addressed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the interpolation mass parameter , @xmath37 , can be extended to account for arbitrary mass parameters in the pseudoscalar direction .",
    "this can be accomplished by redefining @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ delta12 ] ) such that    @xmath41    implying in the most general case , four mass parameters , @xmath37 and the three components of @xmath42 , to be fixed by a well - defined prescription ( optimization ) to determine them .",
    "however , as the landau free energy ( or equivalently , the effective potential ) is concerned , only the fluctuations in the scalar direction become relevant when only the scalar field @xmath43 acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( @xmath44 by slight abuse of notation ) .",
    "in other words , one assumes from now on that @xmath45 , which can be shown to imply  @xcite within the opt that @xmath46 could be relevant to address the further breaking of the remaining @xmath47 symmetry , a case that is not considered here . ] . taking this simplest solution",
