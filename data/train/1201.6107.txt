    "nowadays the most accepted model in cosmology which explains the evolution of the universe is known as @xmath0cdm . in this model 4 per cent of the total content of the universe is baryonic matter , 22 per cent is non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) and the rest is in some form of cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath0cdm has achieved several observations with outstanding success , like for example the fact that the cosmic microwave background radiation can be explained in great detail and that it provides a framework within one can understand the large - scale isotropy of the universe and important characteristics on the origin , nature and evolution of density fluctuations which are believed to give rise to galaxies and other cosmic structures .",
    "there remain , however , certain conflicts at galactic scales , like the cusp profile of central densities in galactic halos , the overpopulation of substructures predicted by @xmath4-body numerical simulations which are an order of magnitude larger than what has been observed , etc ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite )",
    ".    there are other important issues of the @xmath0cdm model which require further considerations .",
    "observations point out to a better understanding of the theory beginning with the local void , which contains far fewer galaxies than the expected .",
    "another problem arises for the so called pure disk galaxies , which do not appear in numerical simulations of structure formation in the standard model .",
    "these problems would be solved , if the structure grew faster than it does in the standard paradigm @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite also found that the collision velocity of 3000km / s at r200 for the bullet cluster is very unlikely and might no be explained by the standard model .",
    "a final example of inconsistencies can be seen in a paper by @xcite , who found anomalies in the mass power spectrum obtained by sdss and the one obtained with the cdm model . with these and other results",
    "it seems necessary to change the @xmath0cdm paradigm to try and explain the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "the incorporation of a new kind of dm , different from the one proposed by the @xmath0cdm model into the big bang theory holds out the possibility of resolving some of these issues .",
    "several authors have proposed interesting alternatives in where they try to solve the latter explained difficulties that the cdm scenario seem not solve .",
    "some of these models consider warm dark matter ( @xcite , @xcite ) , self interacting dark matter ( @xcite,@xcite ) , and other exotic scenarios as braneworld models @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are models that do not include dm but instead modify the newtonian force law @xcite .",
    "other alternative scenario that has received much attention in the last years is the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) model .",
    "the main idea is simple ( see @xcite ) , the nature of the dm is completely determined by a fundamental scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "the sfdm model proposes that galactic haloes form by bose - einstein condensation of a scalar field ( sf ) whose boson has an ultra - light mass of the order of @xmath6ev . from this mass",
    "it follows that the critical temperature of condensation @xmath7tev is very high , therefore , they form bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) drops very early in the universe . in addition , the compton length @xmath8 associated to this boson is about @xmath9  kpc that corresponds to the dark halo - size of typical galaxies in the universe .",
    "thus , it has been proposed that these drops are the haloes of galaxies ( see @xcite ) , @xmath10 , that haloes are huge drops of sf . on the other hand ,",
    "big structures form like in the @xmath0cdm model , by hierarchy @xcite , thus , all successful predictions of the standard model at large scales are well reproduced by sfdm . in other words , in the sfdm model the haloes of galaxies do not form hierarchically , they are formed at the same time and in the same way when the universe reaches the critical temperature of condensation of the sf . from this",
    "it follows that all galaxies must be very similar because they formed in the same manner and at the same moment @xcite .",
    "therefore , from this paradigm we have to expect that there exist well formed galaxy haloes at higher redshifts than in the @xmath0cdm model . in this model",
    "the scalar particles with that ultra light mass are such that their wave properties avoid the cusp problem and reduce the high number of small satellites by the quantum uncertainty principle @xcite which is another problem that is still present in the @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "summarizing , it is remarkable that with only one free parameter , the ultra - light scalar field mass ( @xmath11ev ) , the sfdm model fits :    1 .   the evolution of the cosmological densities @xcite .",
    "the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "3 .   the scalar field has a natural cut off , thus the substructures in clusters of galaxies is avoided naturally . with a scalar field mass of @xmath12ev",
    "the amount of substructure is compatible with the observed one @xcite .",
    "we expect that sfdm forms galaxies earlier than the cdm model , because they form becs at a critical temperature @xmath13tev .",
    "so if sfdm is right , we have to see big galaxies at high redshifts with similar features @xcite .",
    "the rotation curves of big galaxies and lsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "6 .   with this mass ,",
    "the critical mass of collapse for a real scalar field is just @xmath14 , i.e. , the one observed in galaxies haloes @xcite .",
    "the observed properties of dwarf galaxies , i.e. , the minimum length scale , the minimum mass scale , and their independence from the brightness @xcite .",
    "and recently it has been demonstrated that if the scalar mass is @xmath15ev , the sfdm haloes would have cores large enough to explain the longevity of the cold clump in ursa minor and the wide distribution of globular clusters in fornax ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea was first considered by @xcite and independently by @xcite suggested bosonic dark matter as a model for galactic halos @xcite . in the bec model , dm haloes can be described , in the non - relativistic regime , as newtonian gravitational condensates made up of ultra light bosons condensated in a single macroscopic wave function .",
    "thus , becs haloes can be described as a coherent scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "several authors have introduced a dynamic scalar field with a certain potential @xmath16 as a candidate to dark matter , although there is not yet an agreement for the correct form of the potential of the field .",
    "one interesting work pointing this way was done by @xcite and independently by @xcite where they used a potential of the form @xmath17 $ ] to explain the core density problem for disc galaxy halos in the @xmath0cdm model ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented a model for the dm in spiral galaxies , in which they supposed that dm is an arbitrary sf endowed with a scalar potential .",
    "other scalar potential widely used to describe dm is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this potential is very interesting because it can mimic the cosmological evolution of the universe predicted by the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "if we consider a sf self - interaction , we need to add a quartic term to the sf potential @xcite , in this case the equation of state of the sf is that of a polytope of index n=1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "different issues of the cosmological behavior of the sfdm / bec model have been studied ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed fuzzy dark matter that is composed of ultra light scalar particles who are initially in the form of a bec . in their work",
    "@xcite used a bosonic dark matter model to explain the structure formation via high - resolution simulations , @xcite reviewed the key properties that may arise from the bosonic nature of sfdm models .",
    "recently @xcite developed a further analysis of the cosmological dynamics of sfdm / bec as well as of the evolution of their fluctuations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in the same direction , @xcite studied , the growth of scalar fluctuations and large - scale structure formation with the fluid approach of the sfdm / bec model .    on the other hand ,",
    "sfdm / bec model has provided to be a good candidate for dm haloes of galaxies in the universe because it can explain many aspects where the standard model fails ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , many numerical simulations have been performed to study the gravitational collapse of sfdm / bec model @xcite .",
    "@xcite found approximate analytical expression and numerical solutions of the mass - radius relation of sfdm / bec haloes .",
    "recently , @xcite give constraints on the boson mass to form and mantain more than one vortex in sfdm / bec haloes .",
    "these constraints are in agreement with the ultra light mass founded in previous works ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "lately , @xcite performed n - body simulations to study the dynamics observed in ursa minor dwarf galaxy .",
    "they model the dark matter halo of ursa minor as a sfdm / bec halo to establish constraints for the boson mass .",
    "moreover , they introduce a dynamical friction analysis with the sfdm / bec model to study the wide distribution of globular clusters in fornax . an overall good agreement is found for the ultra light mass @xmath19ev of bosonic dark matter .",
    "the main objective of this review is to introduce the framework of the sfdm / bec model that assumes that dm is a scalar field that involves a self - interacting potential of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath6ev is the mass of the scalar field , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we solve the friedmann equations for the sfdm / bec model to show that it behaves just like the cdm model . also , we show that the sfdm / bec predicts galaxy formation earlier than the cdm model , because they form bec at a critical temperature @xmath21 tev .",
    "so , if sfdm is right , this would imply that we have to see big galaxies at high redshifts . in order to do this ,",
    "we study the density fluctuations of the scalar field from a hydrodynamical point of view , this will give us some information about the energy density of dark matter halos necessary to obtain the observational results of large - scale structure .",
    "here we will give some tools that might be necessary for the study of the early formation of structure .",
    "in section [ cosmology ] we study the cosmological evolution of the sf with a field and a fluid approach .",
    "we obtain a numerical solution for the scalar density as well as analytical expressions for the kinetic and potential energies of the sf . also , we study the evolution for the density contrast of scalar fluctuations in the linear regime . in section [ galacticsfdm ]",
    "we study the rotation curves and the cusp / core discrepancy with sfdm haloes to compare with the predictions of cdm .",
    "finally we give our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the framework of the standard cosmological model is of a homogeneous and isotropic universe whose evolution is best described by friedmann s equations that come from general relativity and whose main ingredients can be described by fluids whose characteristics are very similar to those we see in our universe .",
    "of course , the universe is not exactly homogeneous and isotropic but this standard model does give us a framework within which we can study the evolution of the expansion rate of the universe as well as the evolution of small fluctuations that give rise to gravitational structures in the universe as galaxies and clusters of galaxies .    in this section ,",
    "we study the cosmological dynamics of the sfdm / bec model and the evolution of their scalar perturbations with two different frameworks : the field and fluid approach .",
    "we use the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric with scale factor @xmath22 .",
    "our background universe is composed by sfdm ( @xmath23 ) endowed with a scalar potential @xmath24 , radiation ( @xmath25 ) , neutrinos ( @xmath26 ) , baryons ( @xmath27 ) , and a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) as dark energy .",
    "we begin by recalling the basic background equations . from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 for a scalar field ,",
    "the scalar energy density @xmath29 and the scalar pressure @xmath30 are given by @xmath31 @xmath32 where the dots stand for the derivative with respect to the cosmological time and @xmath33 is the kronecker delta .",
    "thus , the equation of state ( eos ) for the scalar field is @xmath34 with @xmath35    the radiation fields , the baryonic component and the cosmological constant are represented by perfect fluids with baryotropic equation of state @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant , @xmath38 . for example ,",
    "@xmath39 for radiation and neutrinos , @xmath40 for baryons , and for a cosmological constant @xmath41 .",
    "the einstein - klein - gordon equations that describe this universe are ( in units @xmath42 ) .",

    "notice that background scalar quantities at zero order have the subscript @xmath47 . in order to solve the system of equations ( [ eq : back ] ) , we define the following dimensionless variables @xmath48    here we take the quadratic scalar potential @xmath49 with @xmath50ev . using these variables ,",
    "the equations ( [ eq : back ] ) for the evolution of the background universe are transformed into    @xmath51    [ eq : dsb ]    where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the e - folding number @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54    we have introduced the variable @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a constant , as a control parameter for the dynamics of @xmath57 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsb_s ] ) , @xmath58 is a constant and the exponent @xmath59 is @xmath60 ( see @xcite for more details of the control parameter ) . with these variables ,",
    "the density parameters @xmath61 for each component @xmath62 can be written as @xmath63 subject to the friedmann constraint @xmath64 in addition , we may write the eos of the scalar field as @xmath65 since @xmath66 is a function of time , if its temporal average tends to zero , this would imply that @xmath67-dark matter can be able to mimic the eos for cdm .",
    "we solve the system of equations ( [ eq : dsb ] ) for the background universe numerically with a four order adams - bashforth - moulton ( abm ) method .",
    "we take as initial conditions the best estimates from 5-years @xcite and 7-years wmap @xcite values to @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the exponent @xmath73 . in fig.[fig : phi ] we see the evolution of the scalar field @xmath74 . this figure shows how the scalar field oscillates very stark about the minimum of the scalar potential @xmath75 , on the bottom of this figure we show a zoom of these oscilations . in fig.[fig : ox ] we show the evolutions of the kinetic ( @xmath76 ) and potential energy ( @xmath77 ) of the scalar field , as expected , the sf oscilations are translated into very stark oscilations for the kinetic and the potential energies of the sf .",
    "however , observe the evolution of the dark matter density of the scalar field , that means @xmath78 in fig.[fig : back ] .",
    "note the following crucial point , although the kinetic and potential energies show very stark oscillations , the sum of both energies does not oscillates at all , this sum is the density parameter @xmath79 , which does not display any oscillation .",
    "the important point we have to take from now on into account is that the oscillations are not physical observables at all , they are a feature of the sf , what we observe in fact is the density of the sf which does not oscillates .",
    "fig.[fig : back ] shows the numerical evolution of the density parameters in our model today , so that it relates to the redshift @xmath25 by @xmath80 . ] . at early times , radiation dominates the evolution of the universe .",
    "later on , the universe has an epoch where the energy density radiation is equal to the dark matter density , at @xmath81 , then dark matter begins to dominate the evolution .",
    "the recombination era in sfdm model occurs at @xmath82 . at later times , the cosmological constant dominates the dynamics of the universe at @xmath83 .",
    "the behavior is exactly the same as in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "furthermore , in the recombination era of the sfdm model , the neutrinos made up @xmath84 per cent of the universe completely in agreement with the measurements of wmap .",
    "fig.[fig : w0 ] shows the evolution of the eos for the sf .",
    "although the eos varies with time ( oscillations ) , the temporal average , @xmath85 , drops to zero .",
    "therefore , sfdm is like a pressureless fluid and behaves as cdm at cosmological scales ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .      in this section",
    "we perform a transformation in order to solve the friedmann equations analytically with the approximation @xmath86 .    here",
    "we take the scalar potential as @xmath87 , ( we remain that we use units where @xmath42 unless it is stipulated ) .",

    "so , our background field is proposed as @xmath92 where , @xmath93 and with this our sf in the background can be finally expressed as , @xmath94 with this we obtain @xmath95 ^ 2 .",

    "exist small deviations of this model that were the cosmological seeds to lead the large - scale structure formation in the universe . in this section",
    "we compute the growth of the sfdm overdensities @xmath108 at the stage when the density contrast @xmath109 is much smaller than unity .",
    "it is believed that the universe was almost uniform after inflation , with very small density contrast .",
    "as the universe expanded , the small over - densities grew until they began to collapse , leading to the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "here we consider small enough deviations in the flrw model , so that they can be treated by linear perturbation theory .      in the sfdm paradigm ,",
    "the dark haloes of the galaxies are becs composed of ultra light scalar particles with @xmath15ev then it would be about @xmath110 gev@xmath111 scalar particles to follow in a single galaxy and the occupation numbers in galactic haloes are so big that the dm behaves as a coherent classical scalar field @xmath5 that obeys the klein - gordon equation @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the dalambertian .",
    "therefore , to study the structure formation in the universe we describe a non - interacting sfdm model such that : i ) it can describe it more as a field than as particles and ii ) we find a function that only depends on the three spatial coordinates and time .",

    "is the difference between its value in some event in real space - time , and its corresponding value in the background .",
    "so , for example for the sf we have @xmath114 where the background is only time dependent , while the perturbations also depend on the space coordinates .",

    "another advantage in using this gauge is that @xmath119 will play the role of the gravitational potential , this will help us to have a simpler physical interpretation , i.e. , both potentials @xmath119 and @xmath116 are then related .",
    "this metric has already been used in other works ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "it is worth noting that , to this moment this last set of equations do not involve any approximations with respect to equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) and can be used in linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "now , neglecting squared terms , second order time derivatives and products of time derivatives in this last set of equations we get , @xmath185 where the equation for the gravitational field is given by the poisson s equation ( [ poisson ] ) . in these equations",
    "we have introduced @xmath186 , such that @xmath187 .",

    "note that @xmath188 can represent the velocity field for the fluid and @xmath189 will be the particles density number within the fluid .",
    "also there exists an extra term of third order for the partial derivatives in the waves amplitude which goes as the gradient of @xmath190 , this term would result in a sort of quantum pressure that would act against gravity .",
    "we remain that @xmath119 represents the gravitational field .",
    "these two sets of equations ( [ navier ] ) and ( [ navier1 ] ) would be analogous to the euler s equations of classical fluids , with the main difference that there exists a quantum term , which we will call @xmath191 and will be given by @xmath192 which can describe a force or a sort of negative quantum pressure .",
    "for equation ( [ navier ] ) we have that @xmath189 will represent the mass density or the particles density number of the fluid , where all the particles would have the same mass .",
    "finally , these equations describe the dynamics of a great number of non - interacting identical particles that manifest themselves in the form of a fluid , also equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) can describe a great number of non - interacting but self - interacting identical particles in the way of a bose gas , when the probability density is interpreted as the density number .",
    "now , these hydrodynamical equations are a set of complicated non - linear differential equations . to solve them",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a vecinity of total equilibrium .",
    "for this let @xmath91 be the mass density of the fluid in equilibrium , the average velocity @xmath193 will be taken as zero in equilibrium , so we will only have @xmath194 out of equilibrium .",
    "then , the matter in the universe will be considered as a hydrodynamical fluid inside an universe in expansion .",
    "this system will then evolve in this universe and later on they will collapse because of their gravitational attraction .    then from ( [ navier ] ) for the mass density of the fluid in equilibrium we have , @xmath195 with solutions of the form @xmath196 where as we know , in general if we have an equation of state of the form @xmath197 and consider cdm or dust as dark matter such that @xmath198 it holds that @xmath199 then , when the scale factor was small , the densities were necessarily bigger .",
    "now , the particles density number are inversely proportional to the volume , and must be proportional to @xmath200 , therefore the matter energy density will also be proportional to @xmath200 , result that is consistent with our expression ( [ back ] ) .",
    "in addition , the cosmological behavior of @xmath91 is in agreement with the numerical results show in fig . [",
    "fig : back ] .",
    "now for the system out of equilibrium we have @xmath201 equations that are valid in a universe in expansion . in order to solve system ( [ outeq ] ) we look for solutions in the form of plane waves , for this the convenient ansatz goes as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the position vector and @xmath59 is a real wavevector which corresponds to a wavelength @xmath136 . if we substitute these ansatz in the set of equations ( [ outeq ] ) , we then have @xmath204 where we have defined the velocity @xmath205 to solve the system is convenient to rotate the coordinate system so that the propagation of the waves will be along the direction of one of the axes . for this we know that the velocity vector can be divided into longitudinal ( parallel to @xmath59 ) and transverse ( perpendicular to @xmath59 ) parts , such that @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the vector perpendicular to the wave propagation vector @xmath208 . in terms of @xmath207 for equations ( [ eq1])-([modos ] ) we have @xmath209 in addition to an equation for @xmath207 , @xmath210 , with solutions",

    "is given by , @xmath216 where @xmath217 is defined as the sound velocity ( which in our case it is not ) .",
    "now lets analyze equation ( [ deltacdm ] ) at the beginning of the matter dominated era a time just after the epoch of equality , and just before recombination when the radiation has cooled down and the photons do not interact with the electrons anymore , for a relativistic treatment see @xcite . in this era , @xmath218 , practically all the interesting fluctuation modes are well within the horizon , and the evolution of the perturbations can be well described within the newtonian analysis . at this time",
    ", matter behaves like dust with zero pressure .",
    "so we have @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 therefore @xmath222 . for equation ( [ deltacdm ] )",
    "we have @xmath223    the solutions to this equation are of the form @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are integration constants , from this solution we can see that we have modes that will disappear as time goes by , and modes that grow proportionally to the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is an important result , because then the density contrast will grow proportionally to the expansion of the universe when this is dominated by matter .",
    "then , these fluctuations can maybe grow and give life to the galaxies , clusters of galaxies and all the large - scale structure we see now a days .",
    "now lets see what happens to the sfdm at this epoch ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "the evolution of the perturbations in this case will be given by equation ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "in general we have that in equation ( [ delta ] ) the term @xmath227 is very small throughout the evolution of the pertubations ( @xmath228 for small @xmath59 ) , so it really does not have a significant contribution on its evolution .",
    "when the condition @xmath102 is taken we can have a bec that might be or might not be stable , if there exists stability the results of sfdm are consistent with those obtained from cdm ( in this case both equations ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ deltacdm ] ) are almost equal ) , the condition of stability for the bec in the sfdm case will come from the study of @xmath229 together with @xmath191 .",
    "@xmath230    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the perturbations used for the @xmath0cdm model grow in a similar way for the sfdm model , when @xmath102 , in this case both perturbations can give birth to structures quite similar in size , and this will happen with all the fluctuations as long as @xmath59 is kept small .    when @xmath231 the results are quite different , so when discussing the evolution of the density perturbations , there are two different cases : i ) in the case of @xmath232 the amplitude of the density contrast tends to decrease as @xmath229 grows bigger and bigger away from zero until the amplitude of the density takes negative values ( around @xmath233 ) , telling us that this kind of fluctuations can not grow in time , and hence do not form a bec .",
    "ii ) on the other hand if @xmath234 the fluctuations for the density contrast alway grow despite their size , this results means either than the fluctuations grow and form a stable bec or than the density grows because it is collapsing into a single point and our bec might be unstable , the study of the stability of this fluctuations needs then to be studied with non - linear perturbation theory .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in both figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the initial condition for @xmath235 goes as @xmath236 in accordance with the data obtained from wmap .",
    "if these fluctuations result stable and because they are big in size , this means that they can only give birth to large structures .",
    "these fluctuations can then help for the formation of large clusters or other large - scale structure in the universe at its early stages ( around @xmath218 ) .",
    "then , as these kind of sfdm can only interact with radiation in a gravitational form it is not limited by its interaction with radiation , and the dark matter halos can then create potential wells that will collapse early in time giving enough time for the structures to form .",
    "then if dm is some kind of sfdm , the luminous matter will follow the dm potentials giving birth to large - scale structure .",
    "finally , a further analysis is required to obtain better results of the growth of scalar perturbations with self - interacting sfdm as well as to study the transition between linear and no linear regime of scalar fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that the sfdm model at cosmological scale is a plausible alternative to dm nature because it preserves all the success of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in this section we study the sfdm / bec model at galactic scales , we will focus on the cusp / core discrepancy between the numerical predictions of the standard model and the astronomical observations .",
    "as already said before , recent observations in far and nearby galaxies have shown that the @xmath0cdm model faces serious conflicts when trying to explain the galaxy formation at small scales @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath0cdm simulations the halos present rising densities towards the central region behaving as @xmath237 well within 1 kpc @xcite . on the other hand , several observations suggest that the dynamics ( rotation curves ) of dwarf and lsb galaxies are more consistent with a constant central density @xcite , this is most commonly known as the cusp / core problem @xcite .    studying a wide range of galaxies of different morphologies and with magnitudes in the interval",
    "@xmath238 @xcite fit their rotation curves ( rc ) using a burkert profile for the dm @xcite and found that @xmath239 remains approximately constant , where @xmath240 with @xmath241 the central dm density and @xmath242 the core radius .",
    "similar result where found in @xcite .",
    "exploring further the constant value of @xmath243 for the dm , @xcite found that within @xmath242 the dm central surface density in terms of the mass inside it ( @xmath244 ) is @xmath245m@xmath246 pc@xmath247,the gravitational acceleration due to dm felt by a test particle at the radius @xmath242 was found to be @xmath248 additionally they reported the acceleration due to the luminous matter at @xmath242 to be @xmath249 .    in the @xmath0cdm model",
    "the galaxies have evolve through numerous mergers and grew in different environments , the star formation and basic properties of the galaxies are not expected to be a common factor among them . therefore giving both the constancy of @xmath243 and the core in the central regions of galaxies seems very unlikely in this model .",
    "any model trying to become a serious alternative to @xmath0cdm has to succeed in reproducing observations in which the standard model fails but also has to keep the solid description at large scale .",
    "it is always necesary to test the sfdm / bec model with the two observations mentioned above , the cusp / core problem and the constant dm central surface density . in order to do this , in @xcite",
    "it was used the thomas - fermi approximation and a static bec dm halo to fit rotation curves of a set of galaxies .",
    "however , so far there was no comparison between the density profile and the data , in that work this was done by fitting rotation curves of 13 high resolution low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies and additionally compare the fits to two characteristic density profiles 1 ) the cuspy navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile that results from n - body simulations using @xmath0cdm and 2 ) the pseudo isothermal ( pi ) core profile .",
    "the comparison allow to show that the model is in general agreement with the data and with a core in the central region .",
    "for the second goal the meaning of a core is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "large scale @xmath4-body simulations using collissionless cdm the internal region of dm halos show a density distribution described by a power law @xmath250 with @xmath251 , such behaviour is what is now called a cusp .",
    "on the other hand , observations mainly in dwarf and lsb galaxies seem to prefer a central density going as @xmath252 .",
    "this discrepancy between observation and the cdm model receives the name of cusp / core problem . among the empirical profiles most frequently used to describe the constant density behavior in this galaxies are the pi @xcite , the isothermal @xcite and the burkert profile @xcite .",
    "even though their behavior is similar in the central region and is specified by the central density fitting parameter , their second parameter called the core radius does not represent the same idea .",
    "for instance , in the pi profile ( eq.([eq : pi ] ) ) we see that the core radius will be the distance in which the density is half the central density . for the burkert profile",
    "the core radius @xmath253 will be when @xmath254 and for an isothermal profile ( i ) @xcite @xmath255 .",
    "hence , we see an ambiguity in the meaning of the core radius , they get the same name but the interpretation depends on the profile . if we want to compare the central density of lsb galaxies with that of nfw , it usually suffice to have a qualitative comparison , so far this is what we have been doing by fitting empirical profiles .",
    "however , high resolution rotation curves demand a more quantitative comparison . indeed ,",
    "if we want to test models by fitting rcs we have to know the specific meaning and size of the core , then we will be able to tell if a model is consistent with a cusp or not by making a direct comparison with the data .",
    "in @xcite it was proposed a new definition for the core and core radius that allow us to decide when a density profile is cusp or core . using this definition in the sfdm / bec model discussed above it is possible to find that the sfdm / bec model can reproduced the constant value of @xmath243 and as a crosscheck with the pi profile , in @xcite",
    "was found that the results are in very good agreement with observations .",
    "this argues in favor of the model and the core definition .",
    "following @xcite we provide the dark matter density profiles that will be used for the analysis . the case in which the dark matter is in the form of a static bec and",
    "the number of dm particles in the ground state is very large was considered in @xcite . following this paper and assuming the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite which neglects the anisotropic pressure terms that are relevant only in the boundary of the condensate , the system of equations describing the static bec in a gravitational potential @xmath75 is given by @xmath256    @xmath257    with the following eos @xmath258 where @xmath259 , @xmath260 is the mass density of the static bec configuration and @xmath261 is the pressure , as we are considering zero temperature @xmath261 is not a thermal pressure but instead it is produced by the strong repulsive interaction between the ground state bosons .",

    "in addition to this , we have chosen this profile because it is representative of what is called the cuspy behavior ( @xmath251 ) in the center of galaxies due to dm .",

    "we adopt the previous interpretation .    applying the definition to ( [ eq : becrho ] ) we get the core radius for the sfdm / bec profile @xmath283 and for comparison we use ( [ eq : pi ] ) because in turns out that the parameter @xmath272 corresponds to the core radius as defined above .",
    "finally , fitting the nfw profile provides a direct comparison between a cusp and core and hence to the cusp / core problem .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : becrho ] ) that the sfdm / bec model satisfies @xmath284 near the origin , but a priori this does not imply consistency with observed rcs .",
    "therefore we reproduce the fit of the profiles to thirteen high resolution observed rcs of a sample of lsb galaxies given in @xcite .",
    "the rcs were taken from a subsample of @xcite , we chose galaxies that have at least 3 values within @xmath285 kpc , not presenting bulbs and the quality in the rc in h@xmath286 is good as defined in @xcite .",
    "the rcs in this work omit galaxies presenting high asymmetries and included in the error bars are experimental errors in the velocity measurement , inclination and small asymmetries . because the dm is the dominant mass component for these galaxies",
    "we adopt the minimum disk hypothesis ( neglects baryon contribution to the observed rc ) .    as the difference between a core and a cusp",
    "is not overlapped only for data values inside @xmath287kpc and given that in the interval @xmath285 to @xmath288kpc the slopes of core and cusp profiles are very similar , which can lead to the wrong conclusion that cuspy halos are consistent with observations , we determined the logarithmic slope and the uncertainty following @xcite with the difference that we fit only the data within @xmath287 kpc and that there is no need of an uncertain `` break radius '' .    in fig .",

    "the density profiles corresponding to the rcs fits are also shown in fig [ fig : rotcur ] for each galaxy .",
    "we see that the sfdm / bec fit slightly deviates from the farthest data points as a result of having a finite radius @xmath262 that is fixed by the same data .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that the halo might be more extended than the value @xmath262 . as a matter of a fact , the more the extended the `` flat '' outer region in the rcs the more conspicuous the discrepancy .",

    "in this work , we revisit an alternative paradigm to dark matter nature known as scalar field dark matter or bose - einstein condensate dark matter model . in this model a fundamental scalar field plays the role of dark matter in the universe .",

    "[ fig3 ] we can see that sfdm can have bigger fluctuations just before the @xmath0cdm model does , i.e. , it might be that no hierarchical model of structure formation is needed for sfdm and is expected that for the non - linear fluctuations the behaviour will be quite the same as soon as the scalar field condensates , in a very early epoch when the energy of the universe was about @xmath9 tev .",
    "thus , the standard and the sfdm / bec model can be contrasted in their predictions concerning the formation of the first galaxies .",
    "if in the future we see more and more well formed and massive galaxies at high redshifts , this could be also a new indication in favour of the sfdm / bec paradigm .",
    "on the other hand , we also studied the implications of a sfdm / bec model at galactic scales .",
    "we find that the sfdm / bec model gives a constant density profile that is consistent with rcs of dark matter dominated galaxies .",
    "the profile is as good as one of the most frequently used empirical core profiles but with the advantage of coming from a solid theoretical frame .",
    "we fit data within @xmath287kpc and found a logarithmic slope @xmath307 0.27@xmath3 0.18 in perfect agreement with a core .",
    "it is important to notice that the cusp in the central regions is not a prediction that comes from first principles in the cdm model , it is a property that is derived by fitting simulations that use only dm .",
    "in addition , we review a new definition for the core and core radius that allows a definite distinction when a density profile is core or cusp . using this definition",
    "we find the core radius in the sfdm / bec profile to be in most cases over @xmath292kpc bigger than the core radius in the pi profile . as a second result of the core definition ,",
    "we show the constant value of @xmath243 which is proportional to the central surface density .",
    "this result is one of several conflicts that jeopardize the current standard cosmological model .",
    "finally , with all these intriguing results sfdm / bec model could be a serious alternative to the dark matter problem in the universe .",
    "although the observational evidence seems to be in favor of some kind of cold dark matter , if we continue to observe even more galaxies at higher redshifts and if higher resolution observations of nearby galaxies exhibit a core density profile , this model can be a good alternative to @xmath0cdm .",
    "we expect that the close future observations in galaxies surveys can decide the nature of the dark matter .",

    "<S> in the last time the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has suggested more and more that it is not able to describe all the properties of nearby galaxies that can be observed in great detail as well as that it has some problems in the mechanism by which matter is more rapidly gathered into large - scale structure such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we revisit an alternative model , the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) model , which proposes that the galactic haloes form by condensation of a scalar field ( sf ) very early in the universe , i.e. , in this model the haloes of galaxies are astronomical bose - einstein condensate drops of sf . on the other hand , large - scale structures like clusters or superclusters of galaxies form similar to the @xmath0cdm model , by hierarchy , </S>",
    "<S> thus all the predictions of the @xmath0cdm model at cosmological scales are reproduced by sfdm . </S>",
    "<S> this model predicts that all galaxy haloes must be very similar and exist for higher redshifts than in the @xmath0cdm model . in the first part of this review we revisit the cosmological evolution of sfdm model with a scalar potential @xmath1 with two different frameworks : the field and fluid approach . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the evolution equations of the sf in the linear regime of perturbations as well . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar fluctuations have an oscillating growing mode and therefore , this kind of dark matter could lead to the early formation of gravitational structures in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we also revisit how bec dark matter haloes exhibit a natural cut of the mass power spectrum . in the last part </S>",
    "<S> , we study the core central density profiles of bec dark matter haloes and fit high - resolution rotation curves , we show a sample of some low surface brightness galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes is @xmath20.27 @xmath3 0.18 . using a model independent new definition of the core in the bec density profile </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the recent observation of the constant dark matter central surface density can be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in light of the difficulties that the @xmath0cdm model is currently facing the sfdm model can be a worthy alternative to keep exploring further . </S>"
