    "the sliding of two solid bodies relative to one another is a non - equilibrium process where the kinetic energy of the uniform motion is transferred into energy of irregular microscopic motion , i.e. into heat .",
    "this dissipative process leads to friction , called _ dry friction _ , which differs from viscous friction . since more than 200  years the phenomenological laws of dry friction ( coulomb s laws ) are well - known and are well established in applied physics @xcite .",
    "they state that the friction force is given by a material parameter ( friction coefficient ) times the normal force .",
    "the coefficient of static friction ( i.e. , the force necessary to start sliding ) is larger or equal to the coefficient of the kinetic friction ( i.e. , the force necessary for sliding at a constant velocity ) .",
    "one can not expect that coulomb s law can be derived as rigorously as the laws of viscous friction .",
    "the reason is that the latter one can be deduced from the well - established theory of near - equilibrium thermodynamics whereas dry friction works mostly far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "in fact coulomb s laws oversimplify a very complex behavior which involves elastomechanical , plastic , and chemical processes operating on different length and time scales ( for a general overview of the interdisciplinary aspects of dry friction see ref .  ) .",
    "experimentally deviations of coulomb s law are often found @xcite .",
    "for example , the kinetic friction depends on the sliding velocity .",
    "a common pattern is that it first decreases , then goes through a minimum and finally increases @xcite . in the case of a thin lubrication layer ( thickness : a few monolayers )",
    "one often finds the contrary : the kinetic friction first increases , then goes through a maximum and finally decreases @xcite .    in the last ten years the interest in dry friction ( i.e. , friction between solids ) has been aroused again due to the possibility of reproducible friction experiments on the mesoscopic and nanoscopic scale ( nanotribology ) @xcite .",
    "there is some hope that for such less complex systems an understanding is possible by theoretical modeling @xcite . from the general point of view of nonequilibrium thermodynamics",
    "there is also some hope that it should be possible to develop a simple model which shows all the basic phenomenological features of dry friction . like the ising model in the theory of ferromagnetism",
    "it is acceptable that such a model is not realistic in every details .",
    "what is more important is that it is on the one hand sufficiently complex to be a testing ground of basic concepts of the statistical mechanics of dry friction .",
    "on the other hand it should be simple enough to get analytical results .",
    "the frenkel - kontorova - tomlinson ( fkt ) model goes back to an old idea of tomlinson which explains coulomb s laws on the atomic level @xcite .",
    "his attempt concerns the most puzzling feature of dry friction , namely , that the friction force remains finite in the limit of quasistatic sliding ( i.e. , sliding velocity going to zero ) .",
    "it is clear that this behavior can not be treated , like viscous friction , as the linear response of a system near thermal equilibrium .",
    "tomlinson s idea was that friction is caused by mutual `` plucking '' of surface atoms .",
    "each plucked surface atom vibrates .",
    "plucking is possible only if the sliding brings surface atoms into metastable states from which they suddenly jump into more stable ones .",
    "the energy difference is turned into kinetic energy which is totally dissipated due to the emission of some type of bulk or surface waves ( e.g. , sound waves ) by the plucked atom .",
    "this is the basic dissipation channel .",
    "tomlinson s mechanism works even in the limit of quasistatic sliding provided that the barrier between the metastable and the stable states is sufficiently high and the temperature sufficiently low .",
    "this simple picture assumes ( i ) that the relaxation time of a plucked atom is much smaller than the averaged time between two jumps of the same atom and ( ii ) that a vibrating atom does not excite vibrations of other surface atoms .",
    "these assumptions lead to a kinetic friction that does not depend on the sliding velocity @xcite",
    ".    the first assumption does not hold if either the vibration after the jump is not totally dissipated until the next plucking event of the same atom ( weak dissipation ) or the jump itself occurs on a time scale larger than the averaged time between two plucking events of a single atom ( strong dissipation ) .",
    "one can imagine that in the case of atomically flat surfaces such plucking events occur in a regular fashion with a frequency ( so - called _ washboard frequency_@xcite ) which is determined by the sliding velocity multiplied by the principal wave number of the surface structure . in the case of weak damping we can therefore expect _ resonances _ which should lead to a velocity - dependent kinetic friction with resonance peaks .",
    "the situation can be modeled by the independent oscillator or tomlinson model @xcite .",
    "it is a damped harmonic oscillator ( eigenfrequency @xmath2 ) interacting with a sliding surface ( velocity @xmath3 ) which is described by a spatially periodic potential with wave number @xmath4 .",
    "two types of resonances are possible in the tomlinson model @xcite : _ normal resonance _ where the oscillator is plucked after @xmath1 oscillations ( resonance condition : @xmath5 ) , and _ parametric resonance _ which is an instability where oscillations are excited due to the modulation of the effective frequency of the oscillator during sliding ( resonance condition : @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is an integer)@xcite . in the case of weak interaction",
    "these resonances can be calculated analytically , whereas in the case of strong interaction the motion of the oscillator becomes chaotic and pronounced hysteresis occurs@xcite .",
    "the kinetic friction becomes a wild , multi - valued function of the sliding velocity .",
    "this is even the case after averaging over an ensemble of _ identical _ oscillators@xcite .",
    "the easiest way of taking into account the coupling between surface atoms is to introduce a linear nearest - neighbor interaction of the oscillators .",
    "this leads to the frenkel - kontorova - tomlinson model which we have already introduced in ref .  .",
    "the fkt model assumes two rigid sliding bodies where the layer of surface atoms of one body is modeled by a mechanical particle - spring model ( see fig .",
    "there are two kind of springs , a nearest - neighbor spring and a spring which couples each particle to the body .",
    "the interaction between the two bodies is described by a spatially periodic potential .",
    "the dissipative coupling of the layer with the environment is modeled by damping terms which are proportional to the relative velocities .",
    "the static properties ( ground state , meta - stable states , static friction ) of the one - dimensional fkt model have already been discussed in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we investigate dynamical properties such as the kinetic friction of the one - dimensional fkt model . a brief summary of ref .   and of this paper",
    "is given in ref .  .",
    "the fkt model is far from being realistic in certain aspects .",
    "its main disadvantages are the following .",
    "the assumption of harmonic particle interaction does not hold in the case of strong distortions .",
    "the elasticity of the bulk is missing which leads to an artificial gap in the phonon dispersion relation ( see sec .",
    "[ hi.l ] ) .",
    "the fkt model shares many similarities with the burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model@xcite , which was proposed as a model of an earthquake fault .",
    "there also a linear , harmonic chain of blocks attached via springs at a rigid plate is assumed .",
    "but the interaction with the other surface is modeled by phenomenological force describing a dry friction law .",
    "mostly velocity - weakening laws are used .",
    "that is , the friction force decreases with the sliding velocity .",
    "the dynamical properties of the bk model have been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ def ] the fkt model and the kinetic friction @xmath7 are defined .",
    "the behavior for small sliding velocities is treated in sec .",
    "[ low ] . here",
    "mostly stick - slip motion of individual particles occurs . at higher velocities excitations of phonons",
    "become important .",
    "the consequence of several kinds of resonances is discussed in sec .",
    "[ hi ] . in the last section",
    "we compare our results with other models , especially with the bk model .",
    "the frenkel - kontorova - tomlinson ( fkt ) model has already be introduced in ref .  .",
    "thus the key features are described only briefly . here",
    "we will concentrate more on the dynamical properties of the model which have not been investigated in ref .  .",
    "also a definition of kinetic friction @xmath7 is given .",
    "a linear chain of @xmath8 particles coupled harmonically forms the backbone of the fkt model ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the particles can move only parallel to the sliding direction .",
    "thus the model is completely one - dimensional .",
    "all particles have the same mass which defines the mass unit .",
    "also the nearest - neighbor interaction is assumed to be uniform which defines the force unit .",
    "the chain is the interface between two rigid sliding bodies which are modeled in two very different ways .",
    "the interaction with the lower body is described by a spatially periodic potential .",
    "its periodicity defines the unit of the length scale .",
    "the interaction with the upper body is assumed to be harmonic .",
    "that is , each particle is coupled via a spring to the upper body .",
    "all springs are identical and they are attached with equal spacing at the upper body .",
    "the boundary conditions are assumed to be periodic .    in this paper",
    "the motion of the chain is investigated for the case of sliding the upper body against the lower one at constant velocity @xmath3 .",
    "this externally constrained sliding leads to vibrations within the chain .",
    "these vibrations excite waves into the bulk of the sliding bodies which carries energy away from the sliding interface . in the fkt model",
    "the degrees of freedom which are responsible for these waves are not explicitly present .",
    "we include their effect by introducing two phenomenological damping forces which are proportional to the particle velocity measured relative to the lower and the upper body , respectively . in this paper",
    "we investigate the fkt model in the limit of zero temperature where fluctuation forces disappear .",
    "below we will see that the kinetic friction is directly given by the rate of energy which is transferred into these basic dissipation channels .",
    "the equation of motion of the fkt model reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the position of particle @xmath11 relative to its equilibrium value given by the upper body , @xmath12 is ratio of the lattice constant of the upper body to that of the lower body , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the strengths of interaction with the lower and upper body , respectively , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the damping constants of the particle motion relative to the lower and upper body , respectively .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath17 which requires @xmath18 the transformation @xmath19 turns ( [ def.eqm ] ) into @xmath20 with @xmath21    in addition to the symmetries of the fkt model already mentioned in ref .  , eq .",
    "( [ def.eqm ] ) is invariant under translation in time by an integer multiple of the inverse sliding velocity .",
    "below we will see that all solutions which do not break this symmetry are defined by a single one - parameter function , the dynamical hull function , which is similar to the static hull function @xcite .    for the results presented in the following sections , the equation of motion ( [ def.eqm2 ] )",
    "is often integrated numerically .",
    "we have done this by using a second - order runge - kutta scheme which in the non - damping case is identical with the verlet algorithm @xcite . for the time step",
    "we have chosen @xmath22 .",
    "this is sufficient because all simulations are done for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding fastest time scale is @xmath25 .",
    "the kinetic friction @xmath7 is the temporal average of the force necessary to keep the body sliding at a constant velocity @xmath3 .",
    "it is given by the sum of the forces between the particles and the upper body @xcite , @xmath26    there is a second equivalent definition which clearly shows the dissipative nature of the kinetic friction .",
    "the idea is that after the decay of transients the energy flows through the system at a constant rate .",
    "that is , the energy which is put into the system per unit time by sliding is on average totally dissipated .",
    "thus the total energy ( i.e. , the kinetic and the potential energy ) of the chain is on average constant . with the further assumption that the motion of the @xmath27 s is bounded",
    "we get @xmath28    from the last definition we clearly see that the kinetic friction is proportional to the _ rate _ of energy transfer from the motion of the interface particles into some types of bulk waves .",
    "this is a general principle : the kinetic friction is determined by the various rates of energy transfer starting from the uniform macroscopic motion of the sliding bodies and ending in some dissipation channels . for the fkt model",
    "we are mainly interested in the efficiency of the transfer from the macroscopic sliding into microscopic motion of the interface particles . in section",
    "[ hi ] we will see that this efficiency is rather high if phonons are excited resonantly .",
    "that is , the kinetic friction as a function of the sliding velocity shows resonance peaks .    in the following sections we always discuss the kinetic friction without the first term of definition ( [ def.fk2 ] )",
    "that is , in any plot of @xmath7 versus @xmath3 one should add @xmath29 .",
    "we will see that for very large velocities this term dominates the second one .",
    "in this section we investigate the fkt model for very small sliding velocities .",
    "in fact we are treating the quasistatic limit @xmath30 . in ref .",
    "we have already discussed the disappearance of the kinetic friction in this limit if @xmath13 is less than some critical value @xmath31 . here",
    "we investigate @xmath7 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath13 below and above this threshold .      in ref .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath32 the stationary values of the @xmath27 s follow the quasistatic sliding adiabatically . furthermore , there is only one stationary state which can be described by the static hull function @xmath33 [ defined by eq .",
    "( 10 ) in ref .   which is identical with ( [ hi.heqm ] ) for @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the solution of the equation of motion ( [ def.eqm2 ] ) in the quasistatic limit reads @xmath35 using ( [ def.fk2 ] ) we immediately see that the kinetic friction behaves viciousely , i.e. , @xmath36 with an effective damping constant @xmath37 in the tomlinson limit ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) and for @xmath39 an analytic expression can be obtained ( see appendix  [ ap1 ] ) . in the limit @xmath40",
    "the effective damping constant diverges like @xmath41      for @xmath42 additional metastable states appear @xcite . due to quasistatic sliding",
    "these states eventually annihilate with an unstable counterpart in a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite . at those points",
    "the chain has to find a new metastable configuration .",
    "that is , the particles of the chain no longer move adiabatically .",
    "they start to move with finite velocities , and after a transient they reach a new metastable state .",
    "the dissipated energy is the difference in potential energy before and after the reconfiguration event .",
    "this is the generalization of tomlinson s friction mechanism .",
    "the kinetic friction in the quasistatic limit is therefore the averaged energy drop per jump @xmath43 divided by the averaged distance @xmath44 between the relative positions of the sliding bodies between two subsequent reconfiguration events : @xmath45    in the overdamped limit , i.e. , @xmath46 , the system selects via steepest descent the nearest possible metastable state on the energy surface .",
    "starting with an arbitrary metastable state the system will reach after several jumps a state which can be obtained by adiabatic deformation from the ground state of the undriven fkt model @xcite .",
    "then this state always reappears after each jump .",
    "the reason for this selection rule is closely related to the fact that the ground state has the highest depinning force of all metastable states @xcite . the sequence of reconfiguration events becomes therefore regular .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is the ratio of two coprime integers @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) where @xmath48 is a divisor of @xmath8 . in each reconfiguration event",
    "@xmath50 equally spaced particles jump into the neighboring potential wells . each jumping particle together with the neighboring particles dissipates @xmath51 .",
    "thus the totally dissipated energy is @xmath52 .",
    "the distance between two events is @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath54 near the onset of friction @xmath7 scales like @xmath55 the leading orders of this expansion are calculated in appendix  [ ap1 ] for @xmath39 and for the tomlinson limit . for @xmath56 we get ( see appendix  [ ap1 ] ) @xmath57 in the limit @xmath58 the kinetic friction is approaching the static friction @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ f.low ] shows for several values of @xmath12 the static friction @xmath60 and the kinetic friction @xmath61 which are obtained numerically by solving the delay equation of the hull function @xmath33 .",
    "first of all , we notice the excellent agreement between analytical and numerical results for @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the kinetic friction is approaching the static friction from below not only for @xmath62 but also for @xmath63 ( i.e. , for decreasing commensurability of @xmath12 ) .",
    "in fact the difference scales like @xmath53 for @xmath64 .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument .",
    "the jumps of the @xmath50 particles represent a kind of microslip leading to typical stick - slip motion with a sawtooth curve of the lateral force @xmath65 as a function of the relative position between the sliding bodies .",
    "the maximum of this curve defines @xmath60 whereas the kinetic friction is the average in accordance with definition ( [ def.fk1 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath66 is given by half the height of the jumps which is proportional to @xmath53 because in each jump @xmath50 particles are jumping over a distance which is independent of @xmath48 for @xmath64 .",
    "the jump is roughly proportional to the largest gap in the hull function @xmath33 ( see figs .  2 in ref .  ) .",
    "if we take inertia into account , i.e. , @xmath67 finite , the system does not necessarily select the nearest possible minima of the energy landscape .",
    "that is , the particle may jump over several potential wells before being captured .",
    "this has two consequences : ( i ) it lowers the kinetic friction which can become zero in the extreme case of @xmath68 .",
    "( ii ) it makes the motion irregular .",
    "that is , the states between the reconfiguration events are no longer equivalent to the ground state , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are fluctuating properties .    this irregular behavior is similar to the irregular motion in the bk model @xcite .",
    "for example , as in the bk model the fkt model shows a power law distribution of @xmath69 up to a certain cutoff value @xcite .",
    "this cutoff monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath71 the power law disappears and the distribution is exponential @xcite . the power law behavior has also fed the speculation that dry friction may be a self - organized critical process .",
    "this subject is not addressed here .",
    "the interested reader is referred to ref .   where the fkt model is discussed in this context .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the chain does not change qualitatively if the sliding velocity is finite but still small .",
    "there is again a regular sequence of reconfiguration events where @xmath50 equally spaced particles jump .",
    "it is expected that @xmath72 increases with @xmath3 because the critical slowing down of the system near a saddle - node bifurcation delays the reconfiguration event .",
    "thus the energy drop @xmath69 is larger than in the quasistatic limit because at the beginning of the reconfiguration event the strings connecting the particles with the upper body are stretched more . from simulations we find that @xmath73 is indeed positive ( see figs .",
    "[ f.lows ] and [ f.fk ] ) .",
    "we also see that after reaching a maximum @xmath7 decreases . this can be understood in the following way . in the simulations shown in figs .",
    "[ f.lows ] and [ f.fk ] the motion is not overdamped .",
    "therefore the particles oscillate after jumping .",
    "if the sliding is sufficiently fast they are still oscillating at the next jumping event .",
    "thus they explore the phase space and may therefore overcome the barrier before it disappears in the saddle - node bifurcation mentioned above . for increasing sliding velocity the delay caused by critical",
    "slowing down is more and more compensated by this mechanism .",
    "it leads to a local maximum of @xmath72 at a velocity which scales like @xmath67 .",
    "this is roughly confirmed by the friction curves in fig .",
    "[ f.lows ] .",
    "in the previous section we have investigated the fkt model in a regime where tomlinson s basic dissipation mechanism works , namely , that the energy put into the system is released and subsequently dissipated in recognizable reconfiguration events . for increasing sliding velocity the average time between successive reconfiguration events will eventually become smaller than the average time scale on which such events take place .",
    "reconfiguration events overlap and are no longer recognizable .",
    "thus we have entered a new regime where the particles are always in motion . in this regime",
    "the friction may be strongly enhanced due to _ resonances of waves _ ,",
    "i.e. , phonons .    in this section",
    "the consequences of these resonances are investigated on various levels .",
    "first we treat the linearized equation of motion . in a second step",
    "we calculate numerically all regular solutions which do not break the discrete temporal translation symmetry of the equation of motion . then irregular solutions are investigated . at the end of this section we report on solitary behavior .",
    "the external potential describing the hard surface of the lower body makes the equation of motion ( [ def.eqm2 ] ) nonlinear .",
    "therefore it is very hard to find analytical solutions . for a weak potential ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath74 , and sufficiently strong dissipation one can expect that the oscillations of the particles are small .",
    "thus we can linearize the equation of motion , @xmath75 both terms on the right - hand side which are proportional to @xmath13 can be considered as driving terms .",
    "these driving terms are periodic in @xmath76 and @xmath11 with frequency @xmath77 and wave number @xmath78 .",
    "we call this driving wave the `` washboard wave '' .",
    "it leads to different types of resonances .",
    "the first driving term is responsible for the _ main resonance_.",
    "the last term leads to _",
    "parametric resonance_. both terms are responsible for _ superharmonic resonance_.    the washboard wave can resonantely excite phonons ( i.e. , sound waves ) which are solutions of ( [ hi.leqm ] ) for @xmath79 .",

    "to get the same result with ( [ def.fk1 ] ) one has to calculate @xmath10 up to second order in @xmath13 ( see appendix  [ ap2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath30 the kinetic friction ( [ hi.fkmr ] ) goes to zero .",
    "thus we have the frictionless case @xmath32 from sec .  [ low0 ] .",
    "for @xmath39 we recover in leading order of @xmath13 the exact result ( [ ap1.gamma ] ) .",
    "the solution ( [ hi.fkmr ] ) increases with @xmath3 , reaching the maximum @xmath88 at @xmath89 and decreases to zero like @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the resonance peak occurs at that washboard frequency @xmath77 which corresponds to the frequency of the phonon having the same wave vector as the washboard wave .",
    "qualitatively the same behavior of the kinetic friction as a function of the sliding velocity is often found in dry friction experiments between atomically flat surfaces with a few monolayers of lubricating molecules in between @xcite .",
    "usually such friction curves are interpreted as a dynamic phase transition from liquid - like behavior at small velocities to a solid - like state at high velocities . at the maximum of the kinetic friction the lubrication layer",
    "is assumed to be in an amorphous state @xcite .",
    "we can give an estimate of the validity of the kinetic friction ( [ hi.fkmr ] ) .",
    "the linearized equation of motion works fine as long as @xmath92 . using ( [ hi.a ] )",
    "we find @xmath93 ^ 2+(2\\pi v\\gamma)^2 .",

    "thus ( [ hi.fkmr.max ] ) is a good approximation as long as @xmath94 . for sliding velocities much larger than @xmath95 the approximation is always good because the particles make only tiny oscillations around their equilibrium positions .",

    ", the solution ( [ hi.xi ] ) would lead to a term of the form @xmath96 it is therefore natural to expand @xmath10 into a fourier series : @xmath97 the linearized equation of motion turns into a set of linear algebraic equations for the fourier coefficients @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath101 for small values of @xmath13 , ( [ hi.am ] ) can be solved perturbatively ( see appendix  [ ap2 ] ) . in order to express @xmath7 in terms of the fourier components",
    "@xmath98 , we use again definition ( [ def.fk2 ] ) of the kinetic friction @xcite : @xmath102    because @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath103 we expect a peak in @xmath72 near the _ superharmonic resonance velocity _ @xmath104 this justifies an approximation of @xmath7 which takes only the leading term in the power series of @xmath98 into account : @xmath105 this is not a correct expansion of @xmath7 in powers of @xmath13 but it reproduces the superharmonic resonance peaks qualitatively very well as is shown in figure  [ f.res](a ) .",
    "it also gives the right scaling of the height of the resonance peaks , namely , @xmath106 for the superharmonic resonance of order @xmath0 .",
    "a special case of superharmonic resonance is @xmath107 which is the main resonances .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath108 thus the superharmonic resonance peaks occur between zero and @xmath109 .",
    "but they do not order sequentially ( i.e. , @xmath110 for some @xmath111 ) even though @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "the last term in the linearized equation of motion ( [ hi.leqm ] ) is also responsible for parametric resonance of phonons .",
    "parametric resonance is an instability phenomenon .",
    "the prototype is a pendulum with a vertically oscillating support @xcite .",
    "the linearized equation of motion is the well - known mathieu equation @xcite which is a ( damped ) oscillator with eigenfrequency @xmath2 .",
    "energy can be put into the oscillator due to periodic modulation ( with frequency @xmath114 ) of a parameter which determines @xmath2 .",
    "if the oscillator is damped this energy will dissipate .",
    "the behavior of such a parametrically driven oscillator is very different from an oscillator which is driven by an additive force . in the latter case",
    "the response is linear whereas in the first case it is strongly nonlinear .",
    "the linear relationship between the amplitude of the oscillation and the strength of an additive force is caused by the fact that the driving force is _ independent _ of the amplitude of the oscillation whereas in a parametrically driven oscillator the force is proportional to the amplitude .",
    "this leads to a positive feedback mechanism . for a small proportionality",
    "constant ( i.e. , strength of driving ) more energy is dissipated than is gained from driving and the oscillation dies out .",
    "but if the strength of driving exceeds a certain threshold , more energy is gained than is dissipated and the amplitude increases . in a linear equation like the mathieu equation",
    "such solutions go to infinity .",
    "but in real systems like the pendulum , nonlinearities will eventually saturate this growth .",
    "the threshold for parametric resonance is a function on the frequency ratio @xmath115 .",
    "it has relative minima near the _ parametric resonance condition _",

    "the wave number @xmath162 is not arbitrary because momentum conservation ( [ hi.decay.c ] ) has to be satisfied : @xmath253 eliminating @xmath162 in ( [ ap4.ksum ] ) by using ( [ ap4.kp ] ) leads to a nonlinear algebraic equation for @xmath163 which can be solved only numerically except for @xmath254 . in this case",
    "all wave vectors are identical .",
    "that is , @xmath255    the type of the extremum is determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the second derivative of the dispersion relation ( [ hi.disp ] ) . for @xmath254",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath258 thus the extremum is either a maximum or minimum depending on the sign of @xmath259 . in the general case we have two eigenvalues given by @xmath260 where @xmath261 @xmath262 times the eigenvalue @xmath263 , and @xmath264 times the eigenvalue @xmath265 .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath164 near an extremum of @xmath266 can be easily obtained after a linear transformation of the coordinate system @xmath244 into a new system @xmath267 which is given by the eigendirections of the matrix defined by the second derivatives of @xmath158 calculated at the extremum . up to second order we get @xmath268 where @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) is the number of positive ( negative ) eigenvalues of that matrix .",
    "a non - singular matrix leads to @xmath269 , otherwise @xmath270 .",
    "the scaling behavior near an extremum is determined by the states nearby .",
    "thus we perform the integration ( [ hi.rho ] ) only in a spherical domain of radius @xmath271 : @xmath272 where @xmath273 .",
    "one integration yields @xmath274 in the case of either a relative minimum or maximum ( i.e. , @xmath275 or @xmath276 ) we get therefore @xmath277 in the case of a saddle ( i.e. , @xmath278 ) we perform the second integration ( [ ap3.rho2 ] ) by using the euler substitution @xmath279 which yields @xmath280 neglecting the contribution from the upper limit we get @xmath281 where @xmath282 the logarithmic term appears only if @xmath283 is not zero .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath284 holds .",
    "thus @xmath285                          in ref .",
    "also multiple resonances of the form @xmath286 , where @xmath1 is an integer greater than two , are mentioned .",
    "but such resonances do not occur in the limit of disappearing interaction and dissipation .",
    "therefore we believe that the occurrence of these resonances depends on the model .",
    "this should not be confused with the fact that for the _ undriven _ fkt model , where the positions of the sliding bodies are _ not _ externally controlled , metastable states occur not before @xmath13 exceeds a second threshold @xmath287 ( for more details , see ref .  ) ."
