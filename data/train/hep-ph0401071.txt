    "in standard model qcd , the hadronic contributions to the widths of ground state quarkonia are attributed to gluonic decays .",
    "the pseudoscalar states , para - quarkonia , decay predominantly into two gluons while the vector states , ortho - quarkonia , being color singlet spin one states , must decay into three gluons . unlike para - positronium , which can not decay into three photons in ordinary qed due to charge conjugation symmetry , para - quarkonium can decay into three gluons .",
    "however , the three gluon mode is infrared singular and one - loop corrections to the two gluon mode must be included to obtain a finite contribution to the hadronic width @xcite .    by assuming that quarkonia",
    "are weakly bound it is possible to calculate the ncqcd correction to the three gluon lifetimes by computing the annihilation amplitudes for a noninteracting quark and antiquark at rest and supplying a factor of the square of the bound state wave function at the origin , @xmath8 , to account for the leading binding effect .",
    "there is no need to devise an effective interaction as in the case of the pion decay into three photons @xcite .",
    "the ncqcd amplitudes contributing to the three gluon corrections were calculated using the feynman rules of ref.@xcite .",
    "these rules contain contributions involving @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the momenta of two gluons . to ensure that the unitarity conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are satisfied , we take @xmath15 and write @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a unit vector and @xmath19 is the noncommutativity scale .",

    "however , rather than simply keeping the leading term in @xmath40 , we investigated the behavior of the correction to all orders in @xmath40 .",

    "the inclusion of ncqcd corrections to the three gluon decay widths of ortho- and para - quarkonium does not change the magnitudes of their hadronic widths substantially for scales @xmath19 of order @xmath63 tev .",
    "that said , the ncqcd results are interesting in the sense of what they imply about the consistency of perturbative calculations in these models .    for ortho - quarkonium",
    ", the two gluon decay is forbidden by yang s theorem .",
    "hence the three gluon decay can not have any soft gluon singularities because there are no two gluon one - loop corrections available to cancel them .",
    "the absence of soft gluon singularities , which is , of course , a feature of the qcd three gluon decay width , persists when the small ( positive ) ncqcd correction is included .",
    "this is guaranteed by the form of the squared amplitude , eq.([oampsq ] ) .",
    "the situation with para - quarkonium is somewhat more involved because , unlike para - positronium , which can only decay into two photons , both two gluon and three gluon decays are allowed in qcd . in this case",
    ", the three gluon decay has infrared singularities , which can be combined with the one - loop corrections to the two gluon decay to obtain a finite contribution to the hadronic width @xcite . here ,",
    "too , the ncqcd correction is infrared finite , but only as a result of a cancellation provided by the ncqcd effective coupling .",
    "interestingly , this correction is negative , and , while small for realistic values of @xmath36 , it can not change the sign of the total width for any value of @xmath40 .    in summary",
    ", we are led to the conclusion that it is not necessary to invoke the smallness of @xmath36 to obtain a sensible ncqcd correction to the hadronic decays of quarkonia . in principle , should we be presented with a fourth generation of very heavy quarks with lifetimes sufficiently long to produce quarkonia , corrections to their decay widths associated with non - commutative geometry could be calculated consistently in the sense that they are finite for any value of @xmath40 .",
