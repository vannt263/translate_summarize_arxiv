    "the essence of this paper is the simple observation that the curvature tensor of a pseudo - riemannian symmetric space satisfies an identity analogous to the 4 t relation in the theory of vassiliev invariants .",

    "using the metric to identify @xmath3 with @xmath4 , we get a tensor @xmath5 .",

    "this will not only have the obvious implication that @xmath9 produces constant functions on @xmath10 , but also that it satisfies the @xmath11 relation on chord diagrams .",
    "therefore , it defines a weight system and a finite - type invariant of knots through the universal vassiliev invariant .",
    "the algebra of chord diagrams , with the @xmath11 relation , can be equivalently represented as closed trivalent jacobi diagrams , modulo the ihx and as relations . through this viewpoint",
    ", there is a striking connection to metrized lie algebras , which can be used to construct weight systems @xcite .",
    "this is done by placing the totally antisymmetric structure tensor @xmath12 at each trivalent internal vertex and contracting edges using the metric .",
    "the jacobi identity ensures that the ihx relation is satisfied , and one obtains a central element in the universal enveloping algebra . by applying a representation of the lie algebra and taking the trace ,",
    "this construction produces a numerical weight system .",
    "as we shall see , the weight systems defined by symmetric spaces are in fact of this lie algebra type and realized through the holonomy lie algebra and its action on the tangent spaces of the symmetric space .    using the curvature of a hyper - khler metric to construct weight systems",
    "was previously proposed by rozansky and witten @xcite .",
    "soon after , it was realized by kapranov and kontsevich @xcite that the construction would also work in the holomorphic symplectic setting , using the atiyah class in place of the curvature . at each trivalent vertex of a jacobi diagram , rozansky and",
    "witten put a copy of the curvature , viewed as one - form @xmath13 , and contracted using the holomorphic symplectic form .",
    "the one - form part of @xmath14 is left out of this contraction , so the result gives a cohomology class of degree equal to the number of trivalent vertices .",
    "it can be integrated if the dimension of the manifold is appropriate .",
    "the bianchi identity plays an important role , analogous to the jacobi identity , in proving the ihx relation for rozansky and witten . in our case ,",
    "the bianchi identity plays a central role in proving that the weight systems coming from a symmetric space are of lie algebra type .",
    "it literally ensures the jacobi identity for the symmetric triple ( ) of the symmetric space . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not needed to see that symmetric spaces give rise to weight systems in the first place .",
    "this underlines the curious fact , that weight systems coming from symmetric spaces are most naturally expressed on chord diagrams , whereas the rozansky - witten weight systems and bar - natan s lie algebra weights seem to favor the trivalent jacobi diagrams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ cha : vassiliev - invariants ] , we recall the basic theory of vassiliev invariants , establishing notation and introducing the jones and yamada polynomials , which will be used to illustrate throughout . the definitive resources on this theory are bar - natan s paper @xcite and the excellent book @xcite . in section [ cha : constr - weight - syst ] , we give a simple framework for constructing weight systems , using what we call a weight tensor , which must satisfy a variant of the 4 t relation .",
    "the ubiquitous weight systems coming from representations of a metrized lie algebras fit this description , and the weight tensor is obtained by applying the representation to the casimir tensor .",
    "then we prove the main observation of the paper , which is that the curvature of a pseudo - riemannian symmetric space defines a weight tensor .",
    "finally , in section [ cha : symmetric - spaces - lie ] , we prove that the weight systems obtained from symmetric spaces are of lie algebra type and realized through the holonomy lie algebra .",
    "moreover , we use the correspondence between pseudo - riemannian symmetric spaces and symmetric lie algebra triples @xcite to show that a weight tensor of lie algebra type can be realized on a symmetric space exactly if it carries the symmetries of a curvature tensor .",
