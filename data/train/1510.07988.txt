    "the recent discovery  @xcite of the higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) has certainly crowned in the most spectacular way an almost half - century long history of successes of the standard theory of the electroweak interactions , the so called standard model ( sm ) .",
    "albeit the tremendous efforts put in by the experimental collaborations working in the lhc experiments the hunt for new physics ( supersymmetry , compositeness , extra dimensions etc .. ) has been so far unsuccessful .",
    "impressive and increasingly higher new bounds on the scale of several beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios are continually being updated .",
    "however the cms collaboration has recently reported an excess over the sm background expectations in the @xmath0 and @xmath7 final states where @xmath8 is the missing transverse energy . the analysis in  @xcite for a search of right - handed gauge boson , @xmath9 , based on 19.7 fb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity collected at a center of mass energy of 8",
    "tev reports a 2.8@xmath4 excess in the @xmath11 invariant mass distribution in the interval @xmath12 .",
    "a cms search  @xcite for first generation lepto - quarks at a center of mass energy of 8 tev and 19.6 fb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity reported an excess of respectively 2.4@xmath4 and 2.6@xmath4 in the @xmath0 and @xmath13 channels respectively .",
    "several attempts have been proposed in the literature to explain the above cms excesses in the context of various standard model extensions .",
    "for instance in  @xcite the authors propose an explanation of the excesses in the context of @xmath9 decay by embedding the conventional lrsm @xmath14 in the @xmath15 gauge group .",
    "studies of the @xmath0 excess in the context of @xmath9 and @xmath16 gauge boson and heavy neutrinos ( n ) coupling mainly to electrons production and decay appear in @xcite .",
    "similarly @xcite discusses a model with pseudo - dirac heavy neutrinos providing a fit to all excesses in a generic lrsm with arbitrary @xmath17 , @xmath18-@xmath9 boson mixing , heavy neutrino mass n and the @xmath19-n mixing .",
    "in addition , the authors point we point out the consequences of the excesses for neutrino - less double beta decay @xmath20 decay , and find for example that @xmath20 actually provides a pretty severe limit on the @xmath19-n mixing assuming the excesses are real .",
    "other interpretations have been proposed within the context of models with vector - like leptons as in  @xcite showing that resonant pair production of such vector - like leptons decaying to an electron and two jets leads to kinematic distributions consistent with the observed cms data .",
    "the @xmath0 excess has been shown to arise as well in @xmath21-parity violating models through spleton resonant production  @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario based on lepto - quarks is proposed in @xcite , discussing also possible connections to dark matter , which fits the data of the excess seen by cms . in @xcite",
    "the observed cms excesses are explained within superstring inspired @xmath22 models which can also accomodate for the baryon asymmetry of the universe via lepto - genesis .",
    "other studies have emphasized that the observed differences between the @xmath0 , @xmath23 , same sign ( ss ) and opposite sign ( os ) channels and could be addressed including mixing and cp phases of the heavy neutrinos  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is well known that the like - sign di - lepton and di - jet ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath24 violating final state ( keung - senjanovic process ) , is the golden signature to look for heavy majorana neutrinos at high energy hadron collisions  @xcite . studies of heavy ( pseudo - dirac ) neutrino production at the lhc within the inverse see - saw mechanism have been performed  @xcite , also considering the quark - gloun fusion mechanism  @xcite .    in this paper , assuming the existence of a heavy majorana neutrino arising from the well known scenario of compositeness of quarks and leptons , complemented with contact interactions , we propose to study the @xmath0 signature and show that the model in its simplest version can reproduce the essential features of the observed excess in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution .",
    "we discuss how , with some refinement , it has the potential to address also other aspects of the excess , such as the absence of a peak in the @xmath25 invarant mass distribution , the charge asymmetry of the excess and the fact that the same excess is not observed in the @xmath23 channel  @xcite .    in this scenario the heavy excited states ( @xmath26 ) couple , through gauge interactions , with the ordinary sm fermions via magnetic type couplings .",
    "current bounds on excited lepton masses ( generically indicated by @xmath1 ) have been recently strengthened by the lhc run i analyses  @xcite of the @xmath27 signature arising from @xmath28 production ( @xmath29 ) , via four fermion contact interactions with a compositeness scale @xmath2 , followed by the decay @xmath30 .",
    "in particular in  @xcite the atlas collaboration reporting an analysis at @xmath31 tev with an integrated luminosity of 13 fb@xmath10 give a lower bound on the mass of the excited leptons @xmath32 tev ( derived within the hypothesis @xmath33 ) . in  @xcite the cms collaboration reported the results of data collected with 19.7 fb@xmath10 at @xmath31 tev and ( always assuming @xmath33 ) excluded excited electron ( muon ) masses up to 2.45 ( 2.48 ) tev .",
    "preliminary studies within the compositeness scenario of the like - sign di - lepton and di - jet signature were performed long ago  @xcite , assuming the excited neutrino @xmath34 to be a majorana particle . here",
    "our aim is to complement the composite majorana neutrino model of ref .",
    "@xcite with contact interactions which are again a generic expectation of a composite fermion scenario  @xcite . based on previous studies related to the production at lhc of exotic doubly charged leptons  @xcite we expect these contact interactions to be the dominant mechanism for the resonant production of the heavy majorana neutral particles n in the process",
    ". this expectation is indeed verified by our numerical simulations performed with a custom version of calchep  @xcite where our model has been implemented .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrino is produced resonantly in association with a lepton ( @xmath36 ) and then given the relatively important branching ratio for the decay @xmath37 we perform a detailed kinematic study of the like - sign di - lepton and di - jet final state : @xmath38 including the relevant standard model backgrounds .",
    "our study shows clearly that a full fledged analysis of the upcoming data from the run ii of lhc at @xmath39 tev has the potential of observing the signature or alternatively excluding larger portions of the model parameter space compared to those already excluded from analyses of run i  @xcite .",

    "[ sec_model ] we review the theoretical composite model ; in sec .  [ sec_production ] we discuss the heavy neutrino production cross sections and decay rates ; in sec .",
    "[ sec_sig - bkg ] we discuss the same - sign di - lepton and di - jet signature and the main associated sm backgrounds ; in sec .",
    "[ sec_fast+simulation ] we present the results of the fast simulation obtained through the delphes  @xcite software ; finally sec .  [ sec_conclusions ] gives the conclusions with outlooks .",
    "in this section we review the composite model of excited fermions investigated in @xcite within the hypothesis of a heavy majorana neutrino .",
    "compositeness of ordinary fermions is one possible scenario beyond the standard model . in this approach",
    "quarks and leptons are assumed to have an internal substructure which should become manifest at some sufficiently high energy scale , the compositeness scale @xmath2 .",
    "ordinary fermions are then thought to be bound states of some as yet unobserved fundamental constituents generically referred to as _",
    "preons_. while building a fully consistent composite theory has proven to be quite difficult some important and model independent features of the compositeness scenario can be phenomenologically addressed .",
    "quite natural properties of this picture are  @xcite : ( @xmath40 ) the existence of excited states of such low lying bound states of preons @xmath41 with masses @xmath42 ; and ( @xmath43 ) contact interactions between ordinary fermions and also between ordinary and excited fermions .",
    "let us consider here the various possible composite models with respect to the idea of introducing lepton number violation ( lnv ) via a composite majorana neutrino .",
    "+ ( a ) . + the homo - doublet model  @xcite contains a left handed excited doublet along with a right handed excited doublet : @xmath44 typically the left and right handed doublet are assumed to have the same mass .",
    "it is known that two left and right majorana fields with the same mass combine to give a dirac field ( with a dirac mass )  @xcite . the homo - doublet model ,",
    "as laid out , can not therefore accomodate majorana excited neutrinos , and hence lepton number violation ( lnv ) .",
    "this becomes possible if one is willing to introduce a mass difference between the left and right doublet ( @xmath45 mixing ) or , in other words , a breaking of the l - r symmetry .",
    "such a possibility has been discussed for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath46 is possibly a linear combination ( with mixing coefficients ) of majorana mass eigenstates .    on the other end ,",
    "if we do not want to introduce a mass splitting ( or mixing ) between the left and right components in the homo - doublet model , we can account for lnv advocating different models within the compositeness scenario which naturally can accomodate a majorana neutrino  @xcite .",
    "these are the following : + ( b ) .",

    "the magnetic type interactions in this case can be constructed by coupling the left - handed excited doublet to the sm fermion singlets via the higgs doublet  @xcite .",
    "this results in interaction couplings suppressed by a factor @xmath50  @xcite where @xmath51 gev is @xmath52 times the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "+ it is assumed to contain a right handed doublet and left handed singlets : @xmath53\\ , ; \\qquad l^*_r=\\left ( \\begin{array}{c }   \\nu^*_r \\\\ e^*_r \\end{array}\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where we may assume that there is no left handed excited neutrino ( @xmath54 ) so that we can associate to @xmath49 a majorana mass term and @xmath46 is a majorana particle .",
    "this model is described by a magnetic type coupling between the left - handed sm doublet and the right - handed excited doublet via the @xmath55 gauge fields  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the ordinary @xmath58 lepton doublet , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the @xmath58 and @xmath61 gauge couplings and @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the field strength for the @xmath58 and @xmath61 gauge fields ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 are dimensionless couplings which are typically assumed to be of order unity .",
    "the relevant charged current ( gauge ) interaction of the excited majorana neutrino @xmath66 is then : @xmath67    the above mirror type model is therefore the model to which we will refer our detailed simulation of the like sign di - lepton signature at the run ii of the lhc .",
    "incidentally we note that sm extensions involving mirror fermions have been recently considered  @xcite with respect to the phenomenology of the production of mirror quarks at the lhc .",
    "at last we may add that one could also consider extended isospin composite models  @xcite where the excited states are grouped in triplets ( @xmath68 ) or quadruplets ( @xmath69 ) instead of doublets ( @xmath70 ) as considered above .",
    "such extensions of the composite scenario contain exotic charge states like doubly charged leptons and quarks of charge @xmath71 .",
    "some phenomenology of these extensions relative to the doubly charged leptons has been addressed recently  @xcite .",
    "such extended weak isospin composite models could also be considered with the additional hypothesis that the excited neutrino is a majorana particle .",
    "the model with @xmath68 can only couple  @xcite the triplet @xmath72 with the right - handed lepton singlet @xmath73 .",
    "therefore we may assume a sequential type structure with a left - handed triplet and right - handed singlets .",
    "if the @xmath74 is missing we may assume for the @xmath75 a majorana mass term and so the excited neutral @xmath76 of the triplet is a majorana neutrino ( @xmath77 ) .",

    "( [ mirror]&[laggi ] ) . the relevant charged current interaction of the neutral component of the triplet @xmath76 is in this case : @xmath80 which differs form the one in eq .   in the chirality of the projection operator .",
    "the @xmath69 quadruplet @xmath81 couples instead  @xcite with the left - handed sm doublet , so that assuming a mirror type scenario and that there is no @xmath75 we can assign to @xmath74 a majorana mass term so that the @xmath76 neutral of the quadruplet can be a majorana neutrino ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the magnetic type interaction is  @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an unknown dimensionless coupling in principle different from @xmath84 and @xmath85 are clebsch - gordan coefficients . in particular in the case of @xmath69",
    "the relevant neutrino charged current interaction turns out to have the same structure as in eq .  :",
    "@xmath86    therefore the interaction in eq .   effectively describes the charge current interaction of a heavy majorana neutrino both in the ( @xmath70 ) mirror type model or in a composite model with extended weak isospin ( @xmath69 ) , always of the mirror type , provided that we make the correspondence @xmath87 .",
    "contact interactions between ordinary fermions may arise by constituent exchange , if the fermions have common constituents , and/or by exchange of the binding quanta of the new unknown interaction whenever such binding quanta couple to the constituents of both particles  @xcite .",
    "the dominant effect is expected to be given by the dimension 6 four fermion interactions which scale with the inverse square of the compositeness scale @xmath2 :    [ contact ] @xmath88    where @xmath89 and the @xmath90 factors are usually set equal to unity . in this work",
    "the right - handed currents will be neglected for simplicity .",
    "the single production @xmath91 proceeds through flavour conserving but non - diagonal terms , in particular with currents like the third term in eq .",

    "we conclude this section with one final remark regarding the assumption that in this work the dimensionless couplings @xmath93 are @xmath94 .",
    "the production cross sections and the simulations presented in the following are obtained assuming @xmath95 .",
    "this should be recalled when quoting the resulting bounds on the other parameters of the model , namely ( @xmath96 ) . at this",
    "regard we point out that our results can not not be easily rescaled if @xmath97 due to the presence of the contact interaction mechanism which does not depend explicitly on these constants .",
    "although the production mechanism is dominated by contact interactions the gauge interactions do affect the decay of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "a direct comparison with other studies  @xcite which derived bounds on the mixing parameters for the electron falvour of the heavy neutrinos is therefore not possible at the moment .",
    "indeed our production cross sections can not be simply rescaled because of the presence of the contact interaction production mechanism .",
    "we would need to implement in the generator a model with the additional parameters @xmath93 .",

    "the contact interaction mechanism turns out to be dominant in the resonant production of the heavy majorana neutrino .",
    "we have performed a kinematic study of the same - signed di - lepton plus di - jet signature analyzing in detail both signal and background in order to optimize the signal over background ratio .",
    "we find that the invariant mass distribution of the system made up by the second - leading lepton and the two jets is highly correlated to the heavy majorana neutrino mass , see fig .",
    "[ kinematics ] ( bottom - right ) .",
    "a fast simulation of the detector effects and efficiencies in the reconstruction process is performed using the delphes  @xcite package based on a cms - like configuration .",
    "we scanned the two dimensional parameter space @xmath170 for some benchmark values and computed the statistical significance .",
    "we provide the contour plots of the statistical significance @xmath161 at 3- and 5-sigma ( see fig .",
    "[ significance ] ) .",
    "we find for instance that with @xmath171 tev the lhc can reach a 3-sigma sensitivity for masses up to @xmath172 gev respectively for an integrated luminosity of @xmath169 fb@xmath10 .",
    "finally we compared ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) such expected exclusion bounds in the parameter space ( @xmath96 ) with the experimental data of run i c.f .",
    "such analyses have investigated signatures of excited electrons and muons ( @xmath173 ) being produced by contact interactions ( @xmath174 ) and decaying via @xmath175 . strictly speaking such analyses access the parameters spaces ( @xmath176 ) and ( @xmath177 ) that are in principle different from the one presented here ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "however all excited states masses can be assumed to be approximately degenerate , at least at a first order approximation . under this hypothesis",
    "@xmath179 the @xmath0 signature discussed in this work provides contour maps that can be considered on the same parameter space of the other analyses based on @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "this comparison shows that the @xmath0 signature from a heavy composite majorana neutrino has the potential to improve sensibly the current constraints on the composite scenario .    before concluding we would like to comment briefly about another anomaly reported by the atlas collabortion and on recent results from atlas and cms collaborations from runii , and how our model could interpret them .    in a search  @xcite for high - mass di - boson resonances with boson - tagged jets at @xmath181",
    "tev the atlas collaboration has reported an excess at around 2 tev with a global significance of 2.5 standard deviations ( note however that the same search performed by the cms collaboration did not observe a similar excess  @xcite ) .",
    "our model contains fermion resonances ( excited quarks and leptons ) which do not couple directly to a pair of gauge bosons .",
    "indeed a fermion can not decay to a pair of gauge bosons by angular momentum conservation . on general grounds our fermion resonances could produce final states with a pair of gauge bosons but",
    "these would always be accompained by other objects such as leptons and jets ( sm fermions ) . as an example one might think to pair produce the excited neutrinos @xmath182 with the excited neutrinos decaying leptonically @xmath183 .",
    "one obtains a final signature of @xmath184 which is different from the one considered in the atlas search for high mass di - boson resonances consisting of only gauge boson pairs ( @xmath185 or @xmath186 ) .",
    "however one might imagine to pair produce the charged excited fermions , for instance @xmath149 and/or @xmath187 , almost at threshold ( if they are very massive ) .",
    "such pair of heavy fermions could in principle form a 1s bound state ( via the known coulomb and/or color interaction ) which in turn could decay to a pair of intermediate vector boson given the high mass of the hypothetical heavy fermions  @xcite",
    ".    therefore our model has _ in principle _ the potential to reproduce an excess in the di - boson signal .",
    "the estimate of such effects is certainly very interesting and it would surely be worth further investigation ( one needs for instance to understand whether such bound states could form at all in the first place ) .",
    "however a quantitative analysis goes beyond the purview of the present work and we postpone it to a future study .",
    "very recently the cms and atlas collaborations have released the first results of run ii of the lhc at @xmath188 tev , with respectively 42 pb@xmath10 and 80 pb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity  @xcite , reporting about a search for hadronic resonances in the di - jet channel and showing @xmath189 1-sigma excess(es ) at an invariant mass of about 5 tev in the measured di - jet invariant mass distribution .",
    "such excess(es ) , if confirmed by further data and statistics , could in principle signal the first hadronic ( excited quark ) resonance level in a composite model scenario beyond the 2 tev @xmath0 anomaly . indeed",
    "the analysis in  @xcite excludes excited quarks masses from around 3 tev at 95% c.l ( if @xmath33 ) while in @xcite excited lepton masses are excluded at 95% c.l . from @xmath190 tev",
    "( again assuming @xmath33 ) . these experimental bounds would seem to preclude the possibility of an excited fermion bound state with regard to the explanation of the di - boson anomaly at 2 tev ( see above ) since a @xmath187 ( @xmath191 bound state would need to have to a mass of at least 6 tev ( 5 tev ) .",
    "however the quoted bounds for the excited fermions are for @xmath33 which is the limit of validity of the effective composite model . for values of @xmath2",
    "higher than @xmath1 the actual bounds on @xmath1 are lower ( see for example fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison ] ) . in such regions of the parameter space",
    "the 2 tev di - boson anomaly could still be explained ( in principle ) by a @xmath192 ( or @xmath193 ) bound state with a mass @xmath194 tev .    as a last remark concerning the @xmath0 anomaly we would like to comment on the fact that ( @xmath40 ) the same excess is not observed in the @xmath23 channel and ( @xmath43 ) the observed charge asymmetry of the like sign di - leptons  @xcite .",
    "the absence of the excess in the @xmath23 channel could be explained by our model simply assuming that the excited muon state ( @xmath150 ) is somewhat heavier than the @xmath149 and",
    "so it would be observable only at higher energies .",
    "the observed @xmath0 excess consists indeed of 14 events of which 13 are opposite sign ( os ) and only one is same sign ( ss ) .",
    "it must be said that our mirror type composite model with one majorana neutrino will produce the same yield of os and ss events .",
    "such feature could be explained within our composite model assuming the existence of an additional majorana @xmath46 state with a slightly different mass .",
    "indeed it has been shown , albeit within a different ( seesaw ) model  @xcite , that the interference between the contributions of two different majorana states could depress the ss yield relative to the os .",
    "the interference effect could also explain the absence of a peak in the observed invariant mass distribution of the second leading electron and the two jets ( see our fig .",
    "[ kinematics ] bottom right ) . in view of this",
    "it could be worthwhile either to upgrade the calchep implementation of our mirror model to include other majorana states or alternatively to reconsider the homo - doublet model with @xmath54-@xmath49 mixing . in order to address quantitatively this issue",
    "we would need to build a new model ( with more than one majorana neutrino state ) in the calchep generator .",
    "this goes beyond the scope of the present work and will be addressed in a future study .",
    "in summary the results presented in this work are quite encouraging and certainly endorse the interest and feasibility of a full fledged analysis of the experimental data of the upcoming lhc run ii for a search of the heavy composite majorana neutrino , within a mirror type model , in proton proton collisions at @xmath109 tev .",
