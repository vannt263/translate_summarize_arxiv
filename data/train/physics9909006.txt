    "especially , grling has recently formulated a ks formalism for excited states based on dft perturbation theory and demonstrated that the ks eigenvalue difference is a well - defined zeroth order approximation to excitation energies.@xcite this has been also explicitly confirmed for several atoms by accurate quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculations.@xcite    it appears that - at least for localized systems - the unrealistic description of eigenvalue spectra is mainly due to the deficiencies of the conventional approximations for the exchange - correlation energy functional such as the lda or gga rather than the ks scheme itself .",
    "the origin of these deficiencies is now more or less understood from the investigations of the exact properties of the ks exchange - correlation potential @xmath2 which the lda or gga does not satisfy : ( i ) @xmath3 as @xmath4 for finite systems,@xcite ( ii ) the eigenvalue of the highest occupied single particle states is the negative of the ionization energy,@xcite ( iii ) @xmath5 is self - interaction free , and ( iv ) @xmath5 exhibits an integer discontinuity upon the addition of an electron .",
    "@xcite however , it has been recognized that approximations to the _ local _ ks potential obtained from the _ orbital _ dependent exact exchange energy functional through the so - called optimized effective potential ( oep ) method@xcite closely observe these conditions.@xcite    in spite of these good features , the implementation of the oep method is very complicated and its computational cost is excessively high .",
    "only spherical atoms,@xcite jellium surfaces,@xcite jellium spheres,@xcite and periodic solids with a small unit cell@xcite have been extensively studied , and there exists no investigation of molecular systems with the oep method . however , about a decade ago , krieger , li , and iafrate ( kli ) proposed an approximation scheme to the oep , and have shown that the kli potential with the exact exchange - only energy functional ( kli - x ) satisfies the above mentioned properties ( i)-(iv ) of @xmath2 , and accurately reproduces the oep - x results for spherical atoms.@xcite within the kli - x approximation , the workload in constructing the potential is significantly reduced , but this method is still relatively complicated compared with the lda or gga and studies are therefore limited .",

    ", the 3d code reproduced the 1d atomic total energy with an accuracy of @xmath73 a.u./atom which is sufficient for our purpose .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to comment on the issues involved with the use of pseudopotentials . although the rigorous and consistent procedure would be to employ pseudopotentials generated within the same functional approximations , we used lda generated pseudopotentials to carry out all other functional calculations for two reasons .",
    "first , we believe this procedure will not change the qualitative picture , since structural and electronic properties are rather insensitive on the nature of the exchange - correlation energy functional that is used for the small 1s cores of the first - row atoms considered here.@xcite second , we note ambiguities associated with pseudopotential generation procedures . for example , we observed a small but sharp peak at the atomic center in the pbe gga pseudopoential , which caused a serious convergence problem.@xcite moreover , in the kli - x pseudopotential generation , there is an intrinsic problem of slow decaying tails due to the nonlocal nature of the exact exchange functional that somewhat influences the results.@xcite these anomalous behaviors can be only alleviated by some post - processings which introduce additional arbitrariness in pseudopotenials .",
    "we first examine the structural properties of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 given in table [ tab : diatom_ground ] and table [ tab : polyatom_ground ] .",
    "the binding energies @xmath79 , equilibrium bond lengths @xmath80 , and vibrational frequencies @xmath81 of the diatomic molecules were determined from the total energy versus bond - length curves by fitting to the five parameter ( @xmath82 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , a , and b ) hulburt - hirschfelder function , @xcite @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath80 and @xmath82 are the equilibrium distance and bonding energy , using the simulated annealing method .",
    "@xcite the geometries of the polyatomic molecules have been optimized by employing hellmann - feynman quantum forces .",
    "a grid spacing @xmath85 a.u . has been used for all the molecular calculations . for the calculation of binding energies ,",
    "the energies of each pseudoatom and molecules have been calculated by the same method and with the same @xmath70 .",
    "we expect this procedure will result in a systematic cancellation of errors , and in addition we may treat the atom without central field approximation .",
    "our lda and gga results are essentially a reproduction of previous studies .",
    "@xcite the lda consistently overestimates the stability of the molecules and the gga typically cures this tendency of overestimation to a large extent .",
    "the hf approximation on the other hand substantially underestimates the binding energy .",
    "@xcite bond lengths calculated by the lda are usually overestimated and one obtains corresponding underestimations of vibrational frequencies for the diatomic molecules .",
    "the hf method gives the opposite behavior .",
    "the kli - x approximation typically gives similar results as hf for the structural properties which are mostly determined by the total energy functional.@xcite it is well known that the hf method gives the wrong sign of the dipole moment of @xmath75 , and the lda corrects this .",
    "again , the kli - x calculation yields the wrong sign of the dipole moment of @xmath75 in agreement with the hf method .",
    "the difference between magnitudes of the kli - x and hf dipole moment of @xmath75 results from the fact that the hf value has been evaluated at the experimental bond length .",
    "our kli - x calculation at the experimental bond length gave @xmath86 debye .",
    "the addition of an lda or gga correlation energy functional to the exact exchange energy gives mixed results : binding energies are increased , hence improved the kli - x values , but bond lengths are decreased and become worse .",
    "so , we can conclude that the two correlation functional approximations do not give systematic improvements over the exact exchange energy functional , which indicates that these approximations are not accurate descriptions of correlation effects in molecules .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_vxc ] , we compare the lda - xc and kli - x potentials of @xmath74 to reemphasize the different nature of the exchange(-correlation ) potentials from the two methods .",
    "while the lda - xc potential decays exponentially , the kli - x potential reproduces the correct @xmath48 asymptotic behavior , and this causes marked differences in the eigenvalue spectra .",
    "this @xmath48 decay property lets the high - lying ks unoccupied eigenvalues correctly approach a rydberg series , and is also important for other properties that are sensitive to the outer part of the charge density , such as polarizabilities .",
    "eigenvalues of the highest occupied orbitals of the molecules considered in the previous section at their equilibrium geometries ( tables [ tab : diatom_ground ] and [ tab : polyatom_ground ] ) are listed in table [ tab : ioniz_potential ] . compared with the lda or gga",
    ", the kli - x values agree very well with experimental ionization potentials , and they are very close to hf values .",
    "it is well known that hf gives a good approximation to the ionization potential via koopman s theorem due to the fact that omission of correlation tends to be cancelled by the neglect of relaxation in the `` frozen orbital '' approximation.@xcite on the other hand , in the exact dft , the highest occupied orbital eigenvalue equals the ionization potential without any relaxation correction@xcite as we typically see in our kli - x calculations , hence , in principle dft should yield highest occupied orbital eigenvalues in better agreement with experimental ionization potentials than hf . however , in the usual lda or gga , the highest occupied eigenvalues are in serious errors due to the wrong decay property of exchange - correlation potential exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_vxc ] .",
    "the errors are about 0.2 a.u . for the molecules we have studied as shown in table [ tab : ioniz_potential ] . on the other hand , due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ev_homo ] ) , kli - x should give highest occupied orbital eigenvalues in good agreement with experimental ionization potentials when hf values also agree with experimental ionization potential .",
    "the addition of lda or gga correlation potentials to the kli - x potential usually lowers kli - x highest occupied orbital eigenvalues , but this leads to too large ionization potentials .    among the molecules examined in this work ,",
    "@xmath76 is a particularly interesting case which shows the advantage and disadvantage of the kli - x scheme at the same time .",
    "first , note that the hf results are in qualitative disagreement with experiment : it puts the @xmath87 state higher than @xmath88 state as the highest occupied orbital in contrast to the experimental data .",
    "this incorrect ordering of the first two ionization potentials is a well - known example of the breakdown of the hf picture and indicates a large effect of correlation upon the orbitals in @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand note that kli - x gives the correct ordering of the two orbitals , which implies that the local nature of the kli - x potential can make a difference even for the occupied - orbital eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "the fact that the lda also gives the correct ordering ( although the value is worse than the kli - x one due to the above - mentioned reasons ) shows that there are cases where the local potential in the ks scheme is superior to the nonlocal hf potential .",
    "the highest occupied state in the kli - x scheme @xmath89 is equal to @xmath90 [ according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ev_homo ] ) ] which results in the biggest kli - x error among the molecules studied since this also has the largest hf error .",
    "better quantitative agreement with experiment can be obtained by incorporating the correlations , e.g. through many - body perturbation type approach.@xcite    in addition to the eigenvalues of the highest occupied orbitals , we have also examined eigenvalue differences between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals , which are compared with experimental lowest triplet and singlet vertical excitation energies in table [ tab : exctn_energy ] .",
    "first , we point out that the hf calculations give positive orbital energies for all the virtual orbitals in the molecules considered here.@xcite this is because unoccupied orbitals in hf do not really correspond to excited states of the system , in which the excited state electron would have been removed from one of the lower states and acted on by @xmath91 remaining electrons,@xcite but rather the bound states ( if any ) of the singly - charged negative ion , in which the extra electron sees the field due to other @xmath92 electrons.@xcite to make this argument more explicit , we follow slater@xcite and rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uxsi ] ) and ( [ eq : ksji ] ) ( now using the hf orbitals @xmath93 instead of ks orbitals @xmath94 , so @xmath95 is the true hf local exchange potential ) as @xmath96   / \\bigr [ { \\psi_{\\sigma i}}^{hf \\ast}({{\\mathbf r } } ) { \\psi_{\\sigma i}}^{hf}({{\\mathbf r } } ) \\bigr ] }   { |{{\\mathbf r}}-{{\\mathbf r}}'|},\\ ] ] and identify @xmath97 as an exchange charge density . because the @xmath93 s are orthonormal",
    ", the exchange charge density integrated over @xmath98 will be minus one for the occupied orbital ( @xmath99 term exists in the summation @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) , but zero for the unoccupied orbital ( @xmath93 is not included in @xmath100 ) .",
    "hence , the self - consistent field in which an unoccupied orbital moves is that of the nucleus and all @xmath92 electrons instead of @xmath91 electrons .    on the other hand , in dft , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , differences of ks eigenvalues are well - defined approximations for excitation energies .",
    "@xcite umrigar _",
    "have confirmed that this is the case for several atomic systems by showing that the exact ks eigenvalue differences obtained from ks potentials derived from accurate qmc densities almost always lie between the triplet and singlet experimental excitation energies.@xcite they further claimed that this is because of the fact that , in addition to the well known exact properties of @xmath2 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , @xmath2 agrees with the quasiparticle amplitude@xcite for @xmath4 not only up to @xmath102 but up to order @xmath103 inclusive . however , in the lda or gga , no bound unoccupied state exists in many cases , due to the shallow nature of the corresponding exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "we can expect that the kli - x is a much better approximation than the lda / gga , since it satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : ev_homo ] ) and has the correct asymptotic @xmath48 behavior .",
    "our kli - x results indeed always give negative virtual orbital eigenvalues for the studied molecules and also show good agreement with experimental values .",
    "the single exception is @xmath77 in which the difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital eigenvalues is bigger than the experimental triplet and singlet excitation energies by @xmath104 a.u .",
    "further detailed agreements with different multiplet states can be obtained by employing a more involved theory such as dft perturbation theory@xcite or time - dependent dft.@xcite    we close this section by reconsidering the meaning of eigenvalues in the oep - x ( or kli - x ) and hf schemes to make the differences between the two be clear . in the fractional occupation number formalism , kli have shown that @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the hf orbital energy expression for the orbital @xmath40 evaluated using the oep - x orbitals @xmath94 .",
