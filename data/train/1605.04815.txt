    "over the past century , colloidal aggregation has been observed and described in a wide range of contexts via progressively more powerful experimental techniques , phenomenological frameworks , and quantitative models  @xcite .",
    "spanning processes from droplet nucleation and growth , gel and glass formation , various self - assembly processes , etc .",
    ", an overarching goal has been to use statistical mechanical or molecular thermodynamic approaches adopted from atomic systems and , if necessary , empirical rules to relate the _ strength _ and",
    "_ lengthscale _ of particle interactions to resulting equilibrium ( or non - equilibrium ) structures and the thermodynamics ( and kinetics ) of their formation .",
    "these types of relations , especially when based on physically - intuitive thermodynamic arguments , are not only of fundamental importance , but also highlight pathways for engineering materials at the nano- to microscopic level .    in this article",
    ", we focus on fluids where interactions between primary particles ( monomers ) are characterized by attractions acting at small lengthscales close to contact that _ compete _ with repulsions acting at larger lengthscales .",
    "this class of interactions can drive the reversible formation of _ equilibrium cluster phases _ composed of self - terminating aggregates ( droplets ) of monomers .",
    "such cluster phases have been the focus of much recent work , ranging from theoretical and computational studies of idealized colloidal or nanoparticle suspensions  @xcite to experimental demonstrations for both archetypal colloidal particles  @xcite and heterogeneous monomers with anisotropic interactions like proteins  @xcite . despite the range of materials and lengthscales ,",
    "the broad underlying formulation principles appear universal : induce ( or allow ) depletion ( dispersion ) attractions between monomers to drive aggregation while simultaneously controlling electrostatic repulsions between the ionic double - layers of monomers such that they collectively build up to attenuate growth .",
    "while this basic paradigm of frustrating interactions is well - accepted , it is not yet established how to best describe observed cluster phases in terms of their thermodynamics and phenomenology .",
    "for example , is it possible to develop a simple and physically - motivated free - energy model which can generate accurate predictions of characteristic terminal cluster size @xmath0 based on experimentally - tunable variables governing monomer interactions ?",
    "we address this question here by directly comparing free energy - based predictions of such a phenomenological approach against computer simulations for one of the most approachable and idealized cluster - forming models : the short - range attractive , long - range repulsive ( salr ) pair potential  @xcite . once the behavior for this simple system that coarse - grains over many microscopic details of the short - range interactions , electrostatic double - layers , solvent , etc .",
    "is better understood , the goal is then to expand the framework to include more complex free energy contributions relevant for specific realizable colloidal suspensions .",
    "first , we first review the canonical _ a priori _ free - energy treatment for clustering colloidal suspensions due to groenewold and kegel  @xcite , where we compare its predictions for cluster size @xmath0 against a computational survey of phases comprising compact spherical aggregates .",
    "we take great care to clarify how this elegant and frequently - cited model adapts the classical nucleation theory of non - terminating droplets ( or crystals )  @xcite for the salr systems of interest by treating the latter as purely - attractive reference fluids superimposed with perturbative effects due to charges on the monomers and in the suspending solvent .",
    "however , while frequently cited ( and adapted for related systems , e.g. , driven colloids  @xcite ) , this model has not been systematically scrutinized against a large `` test set '' of cluster phases generated by gradually varying relevant independent variables , e.g. , monomer surface charge @xmath1 . by conducting tests that align with the phenomenological assumptions underlying the model ( e.g. , apolar solvents , low cluster density )",
    ", we readily find that the analytical predictive formula derived from their model exhibits a spurious scaling for the range of stable cluster sizes observable in systems governed by salr pair potentials .    with this knowledge in - hand ,",
    "we describe and validate an alternative free energy model that _ quantitatively _ predicts the characteristic cluster size @xmath0 for approximately 100 different simulated salr systems , which comprise compact spherical aggregates in the size range @xmath2 for wide ranges in monomer packing fraction @xmath3 , attraction strength @xmath4 , monomer surface @xmath1 , and solvent screening length @xmath5 ( notably , even finite values outside the apolar limit ) .",
    "in essence , we find that a framework built on classical nucleation theory can indeed describe the thermodynamics of frustrated , finite - sized clusters provided one introduces a _ size - dependent _ enthalpic penalty of interface formation that accounts for the missing coordination bonds of `` surface '' particles in clusters . in justifying this approach ,",
    "we also examine how the number of intracluster short - range bonds scales with size ; interestingly , we find a _ superlinear _",
    "crossover at our cluster sizes that bridges the previously - established scaling regimes for very small sizes  @xcite ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) and larger , bulk - like droplets .",
    "surprisingly , we also demonstrate that intercluster effects need not be considered to obtain correct predictions even for rather non - dilute conditions .",
    "to systematically test the performance of free energy models for predicting equilibrium cluster formation , it is invaluable to be able to ( 1 ) rapidly generate aggregate configurations that can be analyzed in depth and ( 2 ) unambiguously identify relevant free energy contributions .",
    "thus , we consider one of the simplest and most frequently - used models known to form self - limiting aggregates : the short - range attractive ( sa ) , long - range repulsive ( lr ) pair potential  @xcite . the combined salr potential can be expressed    @xmath7    where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath10 is temperature ) ; @xmath11 is the non - dimensionalized interparticle separation ; @xmath12 is the characteristic particle diameter . we include the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 to account for multiple particle types because we follow previous protocols  @xcite and examine size - polydisperse three - component mixtures that approximate colloids with 10% size polydispersity .",

    "crucially , this formulation neglects any long - range multi - body interactions  @xcite , and any charge renormalization due to counterion condensation  @xcite or close monomer association  @xcite . as our goal here is to test how",

    "a vast number of studies have been dedicated to measuring first- and/or second - order corrections for @xmath129 ( the classic first order correction depends on the `` tolman length '' ) to better model , e.g. , homogeneous nucleation , but this topic continues to be active and challenging area of research even for model systems like the lj fluid  @xcite . compared to these studies , which are especially difficult given their general focus on _ critically - unstable _ droplet formation ( usually droplets with radius @xmath130 at the smallest ) , the following analysis is notable because we consider _ stable _ droplets with effective surface tensions dominated by _ short - range _ attractive bonds ( much shorter than , e.g. , lj attraction range ) and radii of less than three particle diameters .    specifically , to capture this size - dependent surface energy , one ought to account for an @xmath64-dependent number of missing coordination bonds @xmath131 for the surface particles relative to the reference bulk ( interior ) coordination number @xmath92 .",

    "5(a ) the extensive number of intracluster bonds @xmath137 measured from md simulations , where we observe a previously undiscovered ( to our knowledge ) superlinear growth rate over the range of cluster sizes that we generate . interestingly , this superlinear behavior contrasts with known small- and large - cluster limits , which are linear in @xmath64 . here , @xmath137 is nicely captured at each packing fraction for @xmath2 by the empirical expression :    @xmath138    where @xmath139 is a @xmath3-specific @xmath95 prefactor   modestly decreases as @xmath3 increases : this occurs because , as discussed earlier , the cluster radius modestly increases with @xmath3 for fixed @xmath0 ; thus , clusters become less dense and exhibit correspondingly fewer bonds . ] and we include a division by 2 for aesthetic alignment with the next results .",
    "this superlinear regime contrasts with the small cluster regime ( @xmath140 ) , where it is known  @xcite that colloidal clusters dominated by sa bonds maximize their extensive bonding number according to the expression @xmath141 .",
    "likewise , in the limit of large droplets , the number of bonds must scale increasingly like in the corresponding bulk fluid , i.e. , @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the coordination number of the reference fluid ( or crystal ) phase .    to quickly understand why @xmath137 growth should be superlinear over this size range ,",
    "we show in fig 5(a ) extensions of the small- and large - cluster linear regimes ( to large and small @xmath64 where they should respectively fail ) to demonstrate that the function @xmath144 connects these otherwise disparate limits while quantitatively overlapping with the upper reaches of the small cluster trend at @xmath145 . to wit ,",
    "notice that the characteristic slope of the small-@xmath64 regime is @xmath146 differs meaningfully from the typical slope in the large-@xmath64 regime of a very dense bulk fluid or crystal , which we estimate as @xmath147 with @xmath148 because it is the sphere kissing number in three dimensions  @xcite ( this is justified later ) .",
    "thus , provided @xmath143 is decidedly larger than 3 , a superlinear regime allows for a smooth continuous growth in @xmath137 with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "this connectivity between very small and large cluster sizes is clearly echoed by the next necessary quantity we must calculate : the average coordination number @xmath149 , which we show in fig .",

    "notably , @xmath136 varies by approximately a _ factor of 2 _ over the size range of interest @xmath2 , which underlines that the conventional practice ( for larger droplets ) of assuming that surface effects are size - independent is problematic for these smaller aggregates .    with @xmath136 in hand , we can proceed to calculate the average number of missing bonds per particle @xmath131 , which indeed collapses onto a master curve scaling as @xmath154 ( shown in fig .",

    "this wide applicability is notable as the underlying free energy framework remains very simple : to wit , intercluster effects can evidently be neglected even as conditions become less dilute ( e.g. , @xmath171 ) , though the current model can not predict more subtle trends known for the salr model  @xcite like the growing polydispersity of aggregates with increasing @xmath3 . meanwhile",
