    "an important problem in dynamics is to describe how horseshoes are destroyed .",

    "the non - wandering set of @xmath9 is a uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 generically unfolds a quadratic tangency at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "according to a general theory of global bifurcations ( for instance , see @xcite and the references therein ) , a surprisingly rich array of complicated behaviors appear in the unfolding of the tangency . in this paper , instead of unfolding the tangency we study the dynamics of @xmath13 from a viewpoint of ergodic theory and thermodynamic formalism .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath13 is close to that of the uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe @xcite , yet already exhibits some complexities shared by those @xmath9 , @xmath14 , and thus will provide an important insight into the bifurcation at @xmath7 .",
    "another motivation for the study of @xmath13 is to develop an ergodic theory for _ non - attracting sets which are not uniformly hyperbolic_. in the rigorous study of dynamical systems , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of chaotic attractors .",
    "a statistical approach has been often taken , i.e. , to look for nice invariant probability measures which statistically predict the asymptotic  fate \" of positive lebesgue measure sets of initial conditions .",
    "the non - wandering set of @xmath13 behaves like a saddle , in that many orbits wander around it for a while due to its invariance , and eventually leave a neighborhood of it @xcite .",
    "such non - attracting sets may be considered somewhat irrelevant , as they only concern transient behaviors .",
    "although this point of view is justified by a wide variety of reasons , the study of non - attracting sets deserves our attention , because of their nontrivial influences on global dynamics .",
    "moreover , important thermodynamic parameters relevant in this context , such as the hausdorff dimension and escape rates , are not well - understood unless the uniform hyperbolicity is assumed .",
    "we state our setting and goal in more precise terms .",
    "write @xmath15 for @xmath13 and let @xmath16 denote the non - wandering set of @xmath15 .",
    "this set is closed , bounded , and so is a compact set .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the space of all @xmath15-invariant borel probability measures endowed with the topology of weak convergence .",
    "for a given potential @xmath18 ( the minus of ) the free energy function @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the entropy of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . an _ equilibrium measure _ for the potential @xmath24",
    "is a measure @xmath25 which maximizes @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27    the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium measures depend upon the characteristics of the system and the potential . in our setting ,",
    "the entropy map is upper semi - continuous ( corollary [ usc ] ) and so equilibrium measures exist for any continuous potential , and they are unique for a dense subset of continuous potentials ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 9.15.1 ) .",
    "however the most significant potentials often lack continuity and the above results do not apply , as is the case of the potential we are now going to introduce .    at a point @xmath28 ,",
    "let @xmath29 denote the one - dimensional subspace such that @xmath30 since @xmath31 expands area , @xmath29 is unique when it makes sense .",
    "we call @xmath32 an _ unstable direction_. denote the jacobian in the unstable direction by @xmath33 the _ geometric _ potential is then given by @xmath34 due to the presence of the tangency , @xmath35 is merely bounded measurable and not continuous .",
    "our goal is to prove the existence of equilibrium measures for @xmath35 with @xmath36 in a certain interval containing all negative @xmath36 and some ( many ) positive @xmath36 .",
    "the ( non - uniform ) expansion along the unstable direction is responsible for the chaotic behavior .",
    "therefore , information on the dynamics of @xmath15 as well as the geometry of @xmath16 is obtained by studying equilibrium measures for the geometric potentials @xmath35 and the associated _ pressure function _",
    "@xmath37 , where @xmath38 for instance , srb measures when they exist should be equilibrium measures for @xmath39 .",
    "those for @xmath40 are the measures of maximal entropy .",
    "in addition , analogously to the case of basic sets of @xmath41 surface diffeomorphisms @xcite , one can show that the hausdorff dimension of the non - wandering set along the unstable manifold is given by the first zero of the pressure function ( * ? ? ? * theorem b ) . as there is no srb measure for the hnon map @xmath15 at first bifurcation @xcite ,",
    "the dimension is strictly less than @xmath42 .",
    "our study of @xmath15 heavily relies on the fact that @xmath15 may be viewed as a singular perturbation of the chebyshev quadratic @xmath43 , because @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "hence , we introduce a small constant @xmath47 to quantify a proximity of @xmath15 to the chebyshev quadratic .",
    "define @xmath48 by @xmath49 observe that @xmath50 .    for any small @xmath47 there exists @xmath51 such that if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then there exists an equilibrium measure for @xmath35 .",
    "the reason for restricting the range of @xmath36 to values for which the pressure of the system is sufficiently large is to deal with measures which charge the fixed saddle @xmath54 ( see figure 1 ) and hence the discontinuity of @xmath35 .",
    "the assumption @xmath53 guarantees that such measures are not equilibrium measures for @xmath35 .",
    "let us here mention some previous results closely related to ours which develop thermodynamics of systems _ at the boundary of uniform hyperbolicity_. makarov @xmath55 smirnov @xcite studied rational maps on the riemannian sphere for which every critical point in the julia set is non - recurrent .",

    "for this model , leplaideur @xcite proved the analyticity of the pressure function .",

    "we show that entropy and the unstable lyapunov exponent are upper semi - continuous as functions of measures ( corollary [ usc ] and proposition [ lyap2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the existence of equilibrium measures for @xmath69 follows from the upper semi - continuity of @xmath70 .",

    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "in sect.2 we study the dynamics of @xmath15 .",
    "our approach follows the well - known line for hnon - like systems @xcite , but now for the first bifurcation parameter .",
    "a key ingredient is the notion of critical points ( see sect.[critical ] ) . in brief terms , these are points where the fold of the map has the most dramatic effect . to compensate for contractions of derivatives suffered at returns to a critical neighborhood , we develop a binding argument ( proposition [ recovery ] ) . in this argument",
    "we use a specific feature of the map @xmath15 , namely that all critical points are non recurrent , which does not hold for the maps treated in @xcite .    in sect.3",
    "we show that the dynamics on the non - wandering set is semi - conjugate to the full shift on two symbols .",
    "this implies the upper semi - continuity of entropy .",
    "although this statement is not surprising , standard arguments do not work due to the presence of the tangency . at the first bifurcation parameter the non - wandering set has a product structure , in the sense that the stable and unstable curves always intersect each other at a unique point .",
    "this defines the semi - conjugacy .",
    "in sect.4 we use the results in sect.2 to bound the amount of drop of the unstable lyapunov exponents of sequences of measures ( proposition [ lyap2 ] ) .",
    "using this bound and the assumption @xmath53 , i.e. , the pressure @xmath73 is sufficiently large , we complete the proof of the theorem . in appendix",
