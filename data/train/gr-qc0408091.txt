    "laser - beam detectors of gravitational waves are designed to explore the universe in a new type of radiation and from a new perspective . with the already operating instruments , and coming soon online",
    ", we are expecting to witness the discovery of fascinating physics involved in powerful sources of cosmic gravitational radiation .",
    "the astrophysical aims of the gravitational wave ( g.w . ) science are well understood and comprehensively described in the literature ( for recent reviews , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "naturally , g.w .",
    "community is focused on the ambitious target of ` reaching for the black holes ' .",
    "but what about a more modest goal of looking inside our own planet  ?",
    "no doubt , black holes are fascinating and scientifically important objects .",
    "but it is also necessary to remember that , say , the still poorly understood and unpredictable earthquakes are claiming thousands of human lives per year .",
    "is it possible that the cutting - edge technology of g.w .",
    "interferometers @xcite may help us with accurate geophysical studies , as a by - product of the continuous search for astrophysical gravitational waves ?",
    "this is the major question of the present work , and the answer is positive .",
    "we shall show in this paper that a laser - beam detector of gravitational waves is in fact automatically a valuable geophysical device . without collecting , recording and processing environmental information of geophysical origin , a g.w .",
    "laser interferometer would simply be incapable of working as a sensitive astrophysical instrument .",
    "certainly , we have to make sure that the extraction of geophysical information does not compromise the astrophysical aims of the instrument .",
    "a laser - beam detector of gravitational waves is a conceptually simple installation .",
    "each arm of the interferometer , typically of the length @xmath2 , consists of two mirrors , and the distance variation between the mirrors is monitored by the laser beam . the mirrors are hanging on wires in supporting towers .",
    "each mirror is essentially a mass element of the pendulum placed in the local gravitational field of the earth .",
    "the eigen - frequency of the pendulum is normally in the range of @xmath3 .",
    "the multi - stage pendulum system shields the mirrors from large uncontrollable displacements of the tops of the supporting towers .",
    "this makes the interferometer capable of measuring , in the region of relatively high frequencies of astrophysical interest @xmath0 , the incredibly small variations of distance between the mirrors , at the level of @xmath4 .",
    "the expected cause of these variations is the incoming astrophysical gravitational wave .",
    "the isolation from noises in the region of relatively high frequencies is only a part of the story . to ensure successful performance of the interferometer as an astrophysical instrument",
    ", control systems of the interferometer should also register and compensate for large external interventions of geophysical origin that take place in the region of relatively low frequencies .",
    "for example , the tidal half - daily variations of distance beween towers separated by @xmath5 are typically at the level of @xmath6 .",
    "this change of distance is 14 orders of magnitude larger than the anticipated astrophysical signal .",
    "if this sort of variations were allowed to affect distance between the mirrors , the interferometer would not be in the ` locked ' state , and hence it would not be able to operate as astrophysical instrument .",
    "the ` locking ' of the interferometer requires that the distance between the mirrors is maintained unchanged with accuracy of approximately one hundredth of the laser light wavelength , which amounts to @xmath7 and less .",
    "this means that the low - frequency variations of distance between the mirrors should be monitored and largely removed by a control system called the adjustment system . a similar monitoring and compensation",
    "should be done with respect to low - frequency variations of the angle between the interferometer mirrors .",
    "this is being done by a control system called the alighnment system .",
    "ideally , in order to reach the astrophysical goals , control systems should keep the interferometer in the working condition for the duration of time exceeding many months .",
    "thus , the collected and recorded low - frequency information , which is vital for maintaining the operational state of the laser - beam detector of gravitational waves , inevitably makes the g.w .",
    "detector also a geophysical instrument .",
    "the time - scales of geophysical processes , some of which are believed to be crucial for global geodynamics , lie in the range from several minutes to several hours .",
    "in other words , we will be interested in frequencies , which we call geophysical frequencies , somewhere in the interval @xmath8 .",
    "in sec.2 we consider a simple model of g.w .",
    "interferometer as a geophysical instrument .",
    "it is assumed that the mirrors suspension points can move and the plumb lines of hanging mirrors can vary .",
    "these changes arise as a result of the earth surface deformations and variations of local gravitational field caused , for example , by the internal earth dynamics .",
    "we derive general formulas for the distance between the mirrors and the angles between the local plumb lines .",
    "ideally , these are two variables that are supposed to be monitored by , respectively , the adjustment and alignment systems of the interferometer .",
    "in sec.3 we consider a number of interesting geophysical phenomena which inevitably affect the performance of a g.w .",
    "the signatures of these phenomena are contained in the outcomes of the adjustment and alignment control systems .",
    "the geophysical effects to be studied include tidal perturbations , normal modes of earth oscillations , movements of the inner solid core of earth , etc .",
    "we place the main emphasis on the fascinating phenomenon of the inner core oscillations .",
    "we estimate the useful geophysical signal accompanying this phenomenon , which will manifest itself in the variation of distance between the mirrors and in the variation of angle between the plumb lines of the hanging mirrors .",
    "the guidance for the expected amplitude of the signal is provided by the reported in the literature indications that the inner core oscillations have been actually detected by other , traditional , methods . from the requirement that the signal to noise ratio should be larger than 1 , we define the level of tolerable noise in the proposed measurements . specifically , the tolerable noise allows the detection of the useful signal , if the observation time exceeds 70 , or so , inner core oscillation periods .",
    "a useful signal can be detected if the environmental and instrumental noises are smaller than the calculated level of tolerable noise . in sec.4",
    "we consider noises which we find most dangerous .",
    "we explicitely show that seismic , atmospheric and instrumental noises should not be capable of preventing the detection of inner core oscillations , even if only marginally .",
    "this refers both to distance and angle measurements",
    ". there exists , however , a specific problem with the angle measurements , related to the fact that the presently operating alignment systems are subject to a certain degeneracy .",
    "they can not tell apart a tilt of the mirror , which we are mostly interested in , and a latteral shift of the mirror , which can be caused by a dull deformational noise .",
    "we analyze this difficulty in great detail in sec.5 .",
    "since the angular measurements provide an important additional channel of geophysical information , we adress the problem of degeneracy in sec.6 and suggest the ways of its circumvention . the desire to keep the angular channel useful for geophysical applications may require some modest and harmless modifications of the optical scheme of g.w .",
    "we discuss at some length a few ideas with regard to such modifications .",
    "it appears that , without interfering with the astrophysical program of the instrument , certain geophysical modifications are feasible .    in sec.7",
    "we emphasize some conclusions of the paper .",
    "to see better how a g.w",
    ". interferometer can work as a geophysical instrument , we will have to consider idealized , but representative , models .",
    "we start with a model of a pendulum , whose suspension point oscillates @xcite , and which is placed in a variable gravitational field .",
    "a pendulum of mass @xmath9 and length @xmath10 can oscillate in the @xmath11 plane , see fig.[f0 ] .",
    "its suspension point has time - dependent coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the local gravity acceleration vector @xmath14 is also a function of time : @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the local gravity field is spatially homogeneous on the scale of small oscillations of the mass , but it is not homogeneous on larger scales .",
    "later , we will take into account its inhomogeneity ( spherical symmetry ) on the scale of two widely separated pendula and even on the scale of displacements of the suspension point of an individual pendulum .",
    "the only dynamical variable in this problem is the angle @xmath16 between the suspension wire and the axis @xmath17 .",
    "the coordinates of the mass are given by    @xmath18     a pendulum with a moving suspension point placed in a variable gravitational field . ]",
    "the lagrangian of the system can be written as @xmath19    using expressions ( [ eq0 ] ) and ignoring non - dynamical terms and total derivatives , one transforms the lagrangian to the final form :    @xmath20    now one can write down the equation of motion of the pendulum : @xmath21 we assume that the time - dependent components of the gravity vector are very small , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the acceleration of the suspension point @xmath24 is much smaller than the unperturbed gravity acceleration @xmath25 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 . then , eq . ( [ dyneq0 ] )",
    "simplifies : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the square of oscillation frequency of the unperturbed pendulum .",
    "the angular variation of the local gravity vector @xmath31 , that is , the angular deviation of the local plumb line , is denoted @xmath32 .",
    "we see that , in the linear approximation in terms of @xmath33 , the pendulum behaviour is affected only by changes in the gravity force direction , namely , by the component @xmath34 of the gravity acceleration .",
    "the variations of the absolute value @xmath35 and the component @xmath36 of the acceleration produce smaller effects , which we neglect .    equation ( [ 2 ] ) is an inhomogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients . in the frequency domain , the relevant solution can be written @xmath37 where @xmath38 are complex fourier amplitudes of the corresponding variables at frequency @xmath39 .",
    "the divergent amplitude at the resonance frequency @xmath40 will be tempered by friction , which we have ignored .",
    "the regions of our interest are relatively high frequencies @xmath41 for astrophysical applications and relatively low frequencies @xmath42 for geophysical applications .",

    "the @xmath50 stages of isolation reduce the external @xmath49 by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "this makes the mirror shielded from large deformational shifts of the suspension point , and therefore the interferometer becomes capable of detecting increadibly small distance variations caused by astrophysical signals .",
    "however , the displacement caused by the local gravitational environment ( the last term in eq.([5 ] ) ) , can not be shielded .",

    "+ the pendulum angular amplitude is given by @xmath52 the contribution to @xmath53 provided by movements of the suspension point ( first term in eq.([4 ] ) ) is suppressed by a factor @xmath54 . at sufficiently low frequencies ,",
    "this term can become smaller than the second term in eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "one can say that , in this regime , the equilibrium position of the pendulum follows a new plumb line @xmath55 determined by the slow variation @xmath56 of the local gravity force vector @xmath31 .",
    "the horizontal position of the pendulum mass , in the low - frequency approximation , is given by @xmath57 it follows from eq.([5new ] ) that the movements of the suspension point transmit practically without change into the movements of the pendulum mass . in other words ,",
    "the low - frequency deformations can not be shielded , so they should be monitored and compensated by the control systems .",
    "the interferometer arm includes two separated pendula , and it is the difference of displacements and difference of mirrors inclinations that are actually being monitored .",
    "we assume that the pendula are identical , but their environments are different , see fig.[f1 ] .",
    "relative variations of plumb lines and mass  positions in an interferometer . ]",
    "we denote by symbol @xmath58 the variations at each site and by symbol @xmath59 the difference of variations at two sites .",
    "it is important to know how different conditions are at two sites .",
    "if the characteristic spatial scale @xmath60 of perturbations is shorter than @xmath61 , then the conditions at two sites are not correlated , and @xmath59-variations are typically of the same order of magnitude as the largest of individual @xmath58-variations . however ,",
    "if both sites are covered by a long - wavelength perturbation @xmath62 , then the @xmath59-variations are much smaller than the @xmath58-variations .",
    "symbolically , we can write @xmath63    let the unperturbed coordinates of the suspension points be @xmath64 .",
    "each point is subject to time - dependent deformational shifts @xmath65 . of course , they are much smaller than the unperturbed distance @xmath61 , @xmath66 .",
    "we will also use the difference of the deformational shifts , @xmath67 .",
    "the difference of angular variables of the two pendula is @xmath68 .",
    "the difference of local values of @xmath34 and , hence , the angle between the local plumb lines at two sites is @xmath69 .",
    "[ here we ignore the fact that the earth s gravitational field is centrally - symmetric , which leads to slightly different orientations of the unperturbed gravity force vectors at two cites , but later we will take this fact into account . ]",
    "writing equations ( [ 2 ] ) at two sites , and taking their difference , we arrive at the equation @xmath70 certainly , the relevant solution to this equation is given by the formula similar to ( [ 3 ] ) , with obvious substitutions : @xmath71 the variation of distance between the masses is @xmath72    the high - frequency and low - frequency approximations to equations ( [ 6a ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) follow the lines of equations ( [ 4a ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5new ] ) . in particular , in the low - frequency region , @xmath42 , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 it is seen from eq.([10 ] ) that the large deformational contribution @xmath75 leaks into the system .",
    "this is why the interferometer s adjustment system records and largely removes @xmath75 from @xmath76 by applying force to the mirrors and mechanically adjusting their positions .",
    "( the adjustment system also tunes the frequency of the laser light ) .",
    "the circuits of adjustment system is one of the sources of geophysical information .",
    "the angle @xmath77 between the suspension wires , eq.([9 ] ) , is mostly the reflection of the angle between local plumb lines , first term in eq.([9 ] ) . for sufficiently low frequencies , the second term in eq.([9 ] ) is smaller than the first one .",
    "we assume that the angle between the wires is at the same time the angle between surfaces of the mirrors . under the condition that other contributions to eq.([9 ] ) can be identified and separated ( one complication , related to the centrally - symmetric character of the earth s gravitational field , is treated in detail in sec.4c ) , the alighnment system , whose purpose is to monitor the angle between the mirrors , will be monitoring the angle @xmath78 between the plumb lines .",
    "this control system is another source of geophysical information .",
    "variables of geophysical interest , @xmath75 and @xmath78 , consist of two parts .",
    "one part is a useful geophysical signal , another part is environmental noise . in general , temporarily ignoring noises and other complications , the knowledge of the output signals @xmath77 and @xmath76 allows one to solve equations ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) with respect to @xmath75 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 ideally , this would be a reconstruction , as complete as possible , of the acting geophysical perturbation .",
    "however , complications do exist , and we will perform more detailed analysis in the rest of the paper .    in the end of this section",
    "we shall briefly discuss the distance variations and plumb line deflections in terms of the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath80 of the earth .",
    "the potential @xmath81 is the sum of the unperturbed potential @xmath82 and perturbations caused by external and internal gravitational fields .",
    "the external fields are mostly the tidal effects of the moon , sun and planets .",
    "the internal fields include such effects as normal oscillation modes of earth and oscillations of the inner core of earth . at the surface of an idealized rigid body",
    ", the local gravitational acceleration would be given by @xmath83 .",
    "the true value of @xmath84 at the surface of real elastic earth is somewhat different from this quantity .",
    "this happens because the gravitational field perturbations , originating from either external or internal sources , displace elements of the earth s surface in its own gravitational field and also give rise to a redistribution of the earth s matter density .",
    "in the point of observations , these changes create additional variations of the gravitational potential . in conventional geophysics these effects",
    "are taken into account by some numerical factors called the love numbers @xcite . for a perfectly rigid body",
    "the love numbers are zeros , while for a fluid body they are ones . on real deformable earth ,",
    "the love numbers are roughly of the order of 1 .",
    "the difference of variations of @xmath84 at two sites separated by @xmath61 is causing a change of distance between the sites , and it also determines a relative deflection of local plumb lines . let the common unperturbed @xmath85 point out in the @xmath17 direction , and the sites be located on the @xmath86 axis .",
    "then , if @xmath61 is small in comparison with the characteristic length @xmath60 at which the perturbation of the gravitational potential changes , one can derive : @xmath87 it is clear that we are dealing with gradients of gravity variations @xmath88 .",
    "a projection of this formula on the @xmath89 plane returns us to the results discussed above ( compare with eq.([8 ] ) ) : @xmath90",
    "a number of interesting geophysical phenomena are in fact geophysical signals that can be studied with the help of laser - beam detectors of gravitational waves .",
    "the division of geophysical phenomena into signals and noises is not clear - cut .",
    "for example , the low - frequency seismic perturbations can be assigned to either category .",
    "likewise , periodic thermal deformations of land are probably the largest ones numerically , but they are not of gravitational origin , and we treat them as a predictable and removable hindrance rather than an interesting geophysical signal . in general , we shall regard signals some quasi - periodic processes with strong participation of gravity in them , whereas more random processes we regard noises , hampering detection of the signals .",
    "noises are considered in the next section , while here we focus on some quasi - periodic phenomena which are believed to be important for global geodynamics .",
    "they are accompanied by variations of local gravity vector and land deformations .",
    "both of these perturbations influence the performance of laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves , and should be monitored and removed by the control systems .    _",
    "the earth tides .",
    "_    large perturbations of gravity @xmath84 and deformations of land @xmath91 are induced by the gravitational fields of the moon and , to a smaller extent , sun .",
    "the main tidal harmonics are well described and measured @xcite .",
    "the values and directions of the perturbed quantities depend on the position of the observation point on the earth surface , but we will be mostly interested in their typical ( not exceptionally small and not exceptionally large ) numerical amplitudes .",
    "the dominant contributor to the tidal effects is the lunar @xmath92 harmonic which has a period of @xmath93 and which is quadrupolar in terms of its angular dependence .",
    "the typical @xmath92 amplitude of the variations of the absolute value of @xmath84 is @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the unperturbed gravity field is @xmath96 , so that for the @xmath92 harmonic we have @xmath97 .",
    "the main solar harmonic is @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 . the higher frequency tidal harmonics are considerably weaker .",
    "for example : @xmath101 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 with @xmath105 , @xmath106 .    on the earth surface ,",
    "variations of gravity @xmath84 and displacements @xmath91 of land elements are linked by the love numbers . if @xmath107 is the quadrupole component of the tidal potential , one can write for the radial components @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xcite : @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the earth radius ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 are the love numbers ( @xmath115 ) . since the radial and angular components of the displacement vector @xmath91 are approximately equal , we will be using for all of them the approximate relationship @xmath116 this relationship is valid for any gravitational perturbation , not necessarily a tidal one . specifically for the @xmath92 tidal component , a typical displacement amounts to @xmath117 .",
    "the observed maximal displacements are a factor @xmath118 larger than this evaluation .",
    "the characteristic spatial scale of the considered quadrupole perturbation is @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , assuming that the armlength of the interferometer is @xmath120 , the @xmath59-variation is smaller than the @xmath58-variation ( see eq.([8 ] ) ) in proportion to @xmath121 , which reduces to @xmath122 combining the numbers , we arrive at @xmath123    as was already mentioned , tidal perturbations of this level of magnitude should be easily seen by the interferometer control systems .",
    "a successful performance of the interferometer requires a much better precision in monitoring the distance between mirrors , at the level not less than @xmath124 .",
    "the danger of tidal effects for the ligo interferometers and the necessity of their removal have been long recognised @xcite .",
    "we focus on the positive side of this necessary procedure : the existing network of interferometers , located in different parts of the globe , will allow one to obtain useful information on amplitudes , spatial patterns and temporal phases of tidal perturbations .",
    "this collected and analyzed low - frequency information will help refine numerical values of earth s parameters , such , for example , as its love numbers .",
    "free oscillations of earth . _    as every elastic body , our planet is capable of free oscillations ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the approximation of a non - rotating , uniform , spherically - symmetric earth ,",
    "it is convenient to expand perturbations in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is longitude and @xmath127 is co - latitude : @xmath128 the discrete values of the wave number @xmath129 , @xmath130 , are determined by the radial boundary conditions and the @xmath131-th root , @xmath132 , of the corresponding boundary equation ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the eigen - frequencies @xmath39 do not depend on @xmath9 and are given by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the appropriate speed of sound .",
    "if the multipole order @xmath10 is much smaller than a ( nonzero ) @xmath131 , the deformations have maximal amplitudes in the central region of the sphere . in the opposite case of @xmath10 being much larger than @xmath131 ,",
    "the deformations are mostly concentrated near the surface of the sphere , and it also holds that @xmath135 . in the extreme regime @xmath136 ,",
    "the deformations look more like seismic perturbations rather than free oscillations of earth .",
    "the short - wavelength seismic perturbations can propagate deep to the central regions of earth , refract and reflect back .",
    "this is an important diagnostic of the central regions .",
    "there are two basic types of elastic deformations .",
    "one is accompanied by variations of volume , matter density and gravity @xmath84 , and is called spheroidal modes @xmath137 .",
    "another is not accompanied by these variations ; it represents purely twisting motions , and is called toroidal ( shear ) modes @xmath138 . some of the shear perturbations can not propagate in liquids , and their observed attenuation in the central regions of earth helped discover the liquid ( outer ) core .",
    "many hundreds of earth s normal modes are now identified from the study of ground motions and gravimeter records . the longest period normal mode is @xmath139 with period @xmath140 .",
    "this period is of course consistent with our evaluations given above .",
    "taking @xmath141 and @xmath142 , we arrive at the right value for @xmath143 .",

    "for example , the @xmath147 modes ( @xmath148 ) have equally spaced frequencies in the interval of approximately @xmath149 , again in agreement with the evaluations given above .",
    "free oscillations of earth are best observed after large earthquakes . in contrast to tidal harmonics , the amplitudes of free earth oscillations can not be predicted in advance .",
    "however , it is known that typical observed values of gravity variations in the fundamental @xmath139 mode are at the level of about 1 @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of higher frequency registered modes are smaller , but they can reach @xmath151 @xmath150 .",

    "the acceleration amplitudes are at the level of @xmath154 , and higher @xcite .",
    "there exists the permanently present noise in these modes with the amplitudes corresponding to @xmath155 .",
    "interestingly , this background level of land deformations and gravity variations can not be explained by cumulative effect of small earthquakes , despite the fact that there occur thousands of them per year .",
    "it is suggested @xcite to seek the source of these continuous oscillations of earth in the action of atmospheric pressure variations on the earth surface .",
    "we will return to this discussion in our analysis of atmospheric noises in sec.4b .",
    "the modestly excited higher frequency @xmath145 and @xmath143 modes seem to be within the reach of adjustment and alighnment systems of the gravity - wave detectors .",

    "we want to use one simple formula in the broad interval of frequencies , so we put @xmath223 for this calculation .",

    "it shows that this source of noise can not prevent the observation of the earth inner core oscillations by the adjustment system of laser interferometers .    to check the consistency of our evaluations ,",
    "it is instructive to estimate the upper bound of gravity variations caused by seismic perturbations .",
    "this evaluation of seismic @xmath225 will also be helpful in the next subsection where we are considering atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "we will have to compare our estimations with the actually measured ( total ) values of the acceleration noise @xmath225 at the core oscillation frequencies around @xmath226 and normal mode @xmath227 frequencies ( compare , for example , with @xcite ) : @xmath228    a matter density wave , with the amplitude of density variations @xmath229 and wavelength @xmath60 , produces a local variation of gravity with the amplitude @xmath230 , where @xmath231 .",

    "therefore , the alighnment system of laser interferometers can also be used , barring some complications discussed below , for observation of the inner core oscillations .    _ b ) atmospheric noises _    it is somewhat surprising that the movement of light air in the earth atmosphere can be a more serious source of noise for the proposed measurements than the movement of heavy soil in seismic perturbations .",

    ", we can say that the expected atmospheric noise is marginally acceptable for the proposed geophysical measurements with laser - beam detectors of gravitational waves .",
    "it is likely that some rare events , such as passing cyclones and atmospheric fronts , can produce larger disturbances than the estimates ( [ atmn ] ) , but these atmospheric events can be anticipated and excluded from the data .    _",
    "c ) coupling of noises in distance and angle measurements _    as was already discussed above , variations of the earth s gravitational field , caused either by external or internal sources , produce changes in , both , distance between the sites and angle between the plumb line directions on the earth surface .",
    "it is only on the surface of an idealized perfectly rigid body that the change of angle between the plumb lines is not accompanied by distance variations .",
    "and it is only in an idealized homogeneous gravitational field , or during spherically - symmetric oscillations of a homogeneous sphere , that the change of distance between the sites is not accompanied by the change of angle between the plumb lines .",
    "while describing geophysical signals , we have already noticed this important link between @xmath166 and @xmath167 , see eq.([coupl ] ) .",
    "for example , as we know , the earth inner core oscillations can lead to distance variations with the amplitude @xmath281 , and they will necessarily be accompanied by the angle variations with the amplitude @xmath282 however , even in the absence of any geophysical signal , a similar link exists between the random ( noisy ) parts of @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "fig.[f7 ] illustrates the appearance of noise in the channel of angle measurements , if there exists noise in the channel of distance measurements .",
    "the fluctuating part @xmath283 of distance between the sites ( independently of the reasons why this fluctuating part exists ) translates into the fluctuating part @xmath284 of angle between the plumb lines , @xmath285 .",
    "this coupling takes place simply because of the centrally - symmetric character of the earth s gravitational field .",
    "[ we ignored this fact in derivation of eq.([9 ] ) , but otherwise a term proportional to @xmath286 should have been added to the right - hand - side of that equation . ]",
    "therefore , signals and noises in the two channels are linked by essentially one and the same relationship : @xmath287 this equation gives the minimal and unavoidable level of noise in angles , which arises because of the noise in distances .",
    "other reasons ( for example , related to local inhomogeneities on two sites ) can only make this relationship more complicated .",
    "however , even the simplified link represented by eq.([crel ] ) leads to an important conclusion : there is no special advantage in measuring angles through the alignment control system , rather than measuring distances through the adjustment control system ; the signal - to - noise ratios are practically equal in these channels . on the other hand",
    ", the use of both channels , instead of only one of them , would certainly increase the reliability of geophysical detection .",
    "in particular , the combined information will help identify and remove the distance variations caused by quasi - periodic thermal deformations of the earth surface .",
    "moreover , if both the distance and angles between mirrors are accurately measured ( including their noisy contributions ) , then the use of eq.([crel ] ) for noises ( or , preferably , the use of a more precise version of this equation ) would allow one to subtract from the measured angle that part of the angle which arises purely due to the coupling .",
    "this procedure would help identify that part of the measured angle which is caused specifically by the variation of plumb lines .",
    "it turns out , however , that the angle measurements by the actually existing alignment systems have their own difficulties and ambiguities .",
    "we will fully address them in sec.5 .",
    "coupling of signals and noises in distances and angles ]    _ d ) instrumental noises _",
    "it appears that instrumental noises will not be a major problem for the proposed geophysical studies .",
    "this is not surprising , as the gravitational - wave detectors implement the best currently available technology aimed at measuring much weaker gravitational signals . obviously , geophysical signals have different origin and are concentrated in a substantially different frequency band , but in both cases we are dealing with manifestations of the same force - gravitation .    the tolerable noise of eq.([noises ] ) implies that the accuracy of the adjustment system is better than @xmath288 at frequencies around @xmath289 .",
    "adjustment systems of the presently operating interferometers satisfy this requirement , but , in order to ensure a successful performance of the interferometer as a g.w .",
    "detector , they may not need the low - frequency precision higher than @xmath290 .",
    "certainly , the advanced interferometers will require an enhanced precision of the adjustment systems in the ` control band ' of frequencies .",
    "this is necessary in order to assure that only very small forces are applied to the mirrors themselves @xcite . in any case , from the instrumental point of view , the accuracy of the adjustment system can be made much better than presently achieved .",
    "even smaller variations , at the level of @xmath291 , can be detected by the interferometer adjustment system , if the dominant noise is reduced to the photon shot noise @xcite .",
    "the photon noise limited spectral sensitivity is basically determined by the relationship @xmath292 where @xmath60 is the wavelength of the laser light and @xmath293 is its frequency , @xmath294 is the cavity finesse , @xmath295 is the optical power available at the photodector and @xmath296 is its efficiency . taking reasonable parameters @xmath297 , @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 we arrive at @xmath301",
    "this number can be improved by the increase of @xmath295 .",
    "therefore , we do not expect instrumental noises in the adjustment system to be a limiting factor for the measurement of geophysical signals described by eqs .",
    "( [ oscil ] ) , ( [ core ] ) .",
    "obviously , we assume that the extra noises ( above purely photon noise ) are not excessively large .",
    "the purpose of the alignment system is to monitor and remove possible misalignments between the laser beam and the axis of optical resonator formed by the corner mirror and the end mirror .",
    "one reason for this misalignment to arise is precisely the deviation of plumb lines caused by a geophysical signal and , hence , the change of angle between mirrors . in principle , the existing alignment systems are very sensitive to a possible change of angle between mirrors .",
    "if the dominant noise is the photon shot noise , the angular spectral precision of the alignment system can reach @xcite : @xmath302 where @xmath303 is the diameter of the laser beam ` waist ' . taking the same parameters",
    "as before and @xmath304 , we arrive at @xmath305 this accuracy is at the level of the tolerable noise of eq.([noises ] ) , but it can be improved by the increase of @xmath295 . we cautiously conclude that the instrumental noise of alignment systems will not swamp the expected geophysical signal .",
    "a more fundamental problem with the existing alignment systems lies , however , in a different place .",
    "the error signal of the system can not tell us whether the misalignment arose because of the change of angle between the mirrors or because of the change of lateral position of the end spherical mirror .",
    "the first cause is what we are interested in , while the second cause could be simply an unrelated noise . without solving this problem",
    ", one would not be able to use angular measurements as an additional source of geophysical information .",
    "this is why we address this problem in next sections .",
    "here , we will consider in more detail the response of a g.w .",
    "interferometer to the deformations of earth s surface and variations of local gravity . to be specific",
    ", we will do this on the example of the virgo observatory @xcite .",
    "each arm of the virgo interferometer consists of an asymmetric fabry - perot optical resonator , which is formed by a flat front mirror and a spherical end mirror .",
    "the length of each arm is @xmath203 .",
    "the laser beam enters the resonator through the partially transparent front mirror .",
    "each mirror is hanging on a multi - stage support , which behaves as a single wire pendulum at frequencies below @xmath306 .",
    "the source of light itself is located very close ( at a distance less than @xmath307 ) to the front mirror , so one can neglect the gradients of local gravity and deformations of land at such short distances .",
    "therefore , we shall accept , for simplicity , that in the chosen coordinate system the front flat mirror does not move , the laser beam is always orthogonal to the front mirror , and the beam enters the resonator from one and the same point on the flat mirror .",
    "the problem is still sufficiently general , as the main trouble arises when one considers the relative position and orientation of the remote spherical mirror with respect to the front mirror and laser beam .",
    "the optical axis of the resonator is orthogonal to the flat mirror and goes through the center of curvature of the spherical mirror .",
    "the curvature radius @xmath308 of the spherical mirror is approximately equal to the distance between the mirrors , so we take @xmath309 . in the tuned working condition ,",
    "the laser beam is aligned with the optical axis . in this configuration ,",
    "all light participates in interference , and the sensitivity is maximal . a misalignment between the beam and optical axis is sensed by the changing spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field in the fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "since we have assumed that the beam is always orthogonal to the flat mirror , the misalignment can only arise if the spherical mirror inclines with respect to the beam , or changes its position in the plane orthogonal to the beam .",
    "these possible motions of the end mirror , in the @xmath310-plane containing the beam , are shown in fig.[mirrors ] .",
    "misalignment of the optical axis in the fabry - perot interferometer : a )  aligned configuration , b ) tilt of the spherical mirror , c ) vertical shift of the spherical mirror ]    a technical advantage of this alignment control system ( which turns out to be a big disadvantage for geophysical applications ) is in that the system does not need to know whether the misalignment arose because of the tilt of the end mirror or because of its lateral shift .",
    "they both lead to similar displacements of the optical axis , which will be corrected by the control system without ever distinguishing the true origin of the displacement . in other words",
    ", there exists a degeneracy between tilts ( configuration b ) in fig.[mirrors ] ) and shifts ( configuration c ) in fig.[mirrors ] ) .",
    "they both can result in one and the same parallel displacement of the optical axis ( shown by a dashed line in fig.[mirrors ] ) .",
    "the error signal automatically arises when a misalignment develops , but it will be the same signal for both configurations . in both cases , the feedback mechanical system compensates the misalignment by tilting the spherical mirror and returning the optical axis back to its original position aligned with the laser beam .    let the @xmath86-axis go along the beam and the @xmath17-axis be a vertical direction .",
    "suppose that the plumb line tilts by an angle @xmath311 ( see fig.[mirrors ] ) .",
    "then the curvature center of the hanging spherical mirror moves a distance @xmath312 .",
    "this means that the optical axis will take a new position displaced from the original one by @xmath313 .",
    "now let the suspension point of the spherical mirror shift by a distance @xmath314 ( see fig.[mirrors ] ) .",
    "then the optical axis does also shift by this distance , @xmath315 .",
    "the parallel displacements of the optical axis will be numerically the same , if @xmath316 .",
    "the expected geophysical signal in angle variations is @xmath317 , see eq.([core ] ) .",
    "the displacement of the optical axis caused by this useful signal will be @xmath318 .",
    "this is a measurable signal .",
    "however , such a displacement of the axis can also be produced by a lateral shift of the suspension point @xmath319 .",
    "these lateral shifts of the suspension point are likely to happen - they are well below the displacement noise of eq.([noises ] ) .",
    "all spatial components of the displacement noise have approximately equal amplitudes , so one can be sure that there is also a vertical component of this level of magnitude . in other words , a displacement noise , which is tolerable for longitudinal distance measurements , turns out to be intolerable for angular measurements by the existing alignment systems . although the control system will generate an error signal and will correct the misalignment , it is impossible to distinguish whether it was produced by a useful geophysical effect or by the ever - present displacement noise .    since the channel of angular measurements is important for geophysical applications , we have to find a way of breaking the degeneracy , specific for spherical mirrors , between tilts and shifts",
    ". this will require modest amendments to the existing optical configurations .",
    "some possible ideas are described in the next section .",
    "it is also important to note that the advanced interferometers may not need these amendments at all .",
    "there exist strong arguments in favor of using non - spherical mirrors @xcite in which case the problem of degeneracy will be automatically alleviated .",

    ", the major contribution to @xmath320 is provided by @xmath166 , and this is why we intend to extract information on @xmath166 from the data of the adjustment system .",
    "however , the accuracy of this measurement can be so high that it can reach the level of a much smaller contribution to @xmath320 : @xmath321 , second term in eq.([10 ] ) .",

    "another arm is formed by mirrors attached to the suspension points , or , more practical , to the last stage of the anti - seismic filters . such configuration with two parallel arms",

    "interferometer , m@xmath327 and m@xmath328 are additional mirrors forming the extra resonator , bs and m@xmath329 are beamsplitters and mirrors changing the beam direction . ]",
    "it is supposed that a small fraction of light is deviated from the main beam to the additional interferometer .",
    "as the frequencies of geophysical interest are relatively low , @xmath330 , the relaxation time of the mach - zender interferometer should be sufficiently long .",
    "if the reflectivity of mirrors @xmath331 and @xmath332 is sufficiently high , a small portion of light can resonate in the cavity for long time , increasing the sensitivity of observation .",
    "the added interferometer is capable of measuring the difference of its arm - lengths with high precision .",
    "it is interesting to note that this configuration has been actually realised @xcite , even though the modification is motivated by the struggle with noises rather than by geophysical applications .",
    "the proposed scheme is differential , and therefore it has certain advantages :    - seismic and other common for both arms noises cancel out due to differential character of measurements ;    - sudden changes of laser beam position and direction ( beam ` walks ' and ` jitter ' ) are not dangerous , as they are common for both arms and cancel out ;    - the scheme is universal and can be used at any g.w .",
    "interferometer regardless of the actual construction of suspension .",
    "two other possible modifications , discussed next , are aimed at direct breaking of degeneracy between shifts and tilts in the alignment system .",
    "these modificatons do not imply a deviation of light from the main beam of interferometers and , therefore , they are even less likely to compromise the g.w .",
    "performance of the instruments .",
    "the desired goal of telling the difference between shifts and tilts of spherical end mirror can be achieved by installation of a flat beamsplitter behind the end mirror .",
    "the beamsplitter can be attached to the last stage of the anti - seismic filter .",
    "a scheme of this proposal is shown in fig.[f5 ] .",
    "it is supposed that the beamsplitter ( 2 ) intercepts part of light traveling toward the photodetector ( 3 ) , normally used as an element of the alignment system .",
    "the intercepted light is directed through the focusing lens ( 5 ) toward the additional photodetector ( 7 ) .",
    "this photodetector should be sensitive to the position of a spot of light focused on the photodetector .",
    "for example , the photodetector ( 7 ) could consist of two or four pieces , so that a slight movement of the focal spot would produce a differential signal .",
    "since the spherical mirror ( 1 ) and the beamsplitter ( 2 ) are hanging very close to each other , they participate together in possible shifts of the suspension point and in possible tilts caused by varying local gravity .",
    "imagine that the mirror ( 1 ) and beamsplitter ( 2 ) are shifted together in vertical direction ( configuration c ) in fig.[mirrors ] ) .",
    "this would lead to no change at the photodetector ( 7 ) .",
    "in contrast , if the mirror ( 1 ) and beamsplitter ( 2 ) are tilted together ( configuration b ) in fig.[mirrors ] ) , the focal spot will change its position on the photodetector ( 7 ) leading to a measurable signal . in this way ,",
    "the previously indistinguishable configurations b ) and c ) become distinguishable .",
    "if the evaluation ( [ e3a ] ) of the angular precision remains valid for the proposed scheme , one will be able to extract geophysical information on @xmath167 from this measurement .     a flat mirror ( beamsplitter ) ( 2 ) behind the spherical end mirror ( 1 ) .",
    "a photodetector of the main alignment system is denoted ( 3 ) , the focusing lens - ( 5 ) , the last stage of anti - seismic filter - ( 6 ) , the additional photodetector - ( 7 ) . ]",
    "the most natural solution to the formulated problem is , perhaps , the installation of an additional source of light ( for some extra details on this proposal , see @xcite ) .",
    "imagine that the additional laser is suspended ( possibly , from the same anti - seismic filter ) behind the spherical end mirror and shines inside the main cavity , see fig.[f6 ] . in order to avoid any mixing of the new light with the already present light in the cavity",
    ", the frequency of the auxiliary laser should differ from the frequency of the main laser . however , inside the cavity , the added light satisfies all the usual requirements on mode matching , alignment of the light beam with the optical axis , etc",
    ". a possible misalignment of the new beam with the optical axis of the fabry - perot resonator will be sensed by the same alignment system and in exactly the same manner as it takes place for the main beam .",
    "the only difference is that the detected misalignment of a new beam will be recorded for geophysical studies rather than used for correcting the inclination of the end mirror .",
    "one will also need a new photodetector for the output light .",
    "the auxiliary laser and the end mirror are hanging very close to each other , so they react in the same way to shifts of the suspension point or tilts of the plumb line .",
    "if the laser itself and the end mirror are both subject to a shift of the suspension point ( configuration c ) in fig.[mirrors ] ) the alignment of the additional beam with the optical axis of the fabry - perot resonator remains intact .",
    "the system does not generate an error signal .",
    "in contrast , a tilt of the plumb line ( configuration b ) in fig.[mirrors ] ) will cause a tilt of direction of the incoming beam of the auxiliary laser .",
    "this tilt will be detected by the alignment system , thus distinguishing the configurations b ) and c ) .",
    "the arising error signal is what we are after . assuming that the angular sensitivity is still determined by eq.([e3a ] )",
    ", one will get access to the information on @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , the installation of an extra laser with properties similar to the ones described above was originally discussed in a different context , with the aim of facilitating the initial tuning of the main interferometer .",
    "additional laser behind the end mirror : ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) - the front and the end mirrors of the main interferometer ; ( 3 ) - beamsplitter ; ( 4 ) - additional laser ; ( 5 ) - additional photodetector . ]",
    "the need for successful functioning of laser - beam detectors of gravitational waves inevitably makes them valuable geophysical instruments .",
    "the most immediate application of g.w .",
    "detectors is accurate measurement of low - frequency distance variations between the central mirror and the end mirrors .",
    "essentially , the adjustment control system makes the interferometer a low - frequency 3-point meter of deformations . the principal advantage of the existing g.w .",
    "detectors in comparison with traditional geophysical techniques is exceptionally long arms of interferometers ( a few kilometers in comparison with typical hundred - meter long geophysical interferometers ) and high sensitivity of measurements .",
    "this advantage leads to a much better strain sensitivity .",
    "the extraction of deformational part of the geophysical signal does not imply any hardware modifications , and it can be found in records of the adjustment system right at the level of data analysis .",
    "the alignment system of g.w . laser interferometers on suspended mirrors can potentially provide even more interesting geophysical information - the relative variation of local gravity vectors ( plumb lines ) .",
    "this sort of information can not be obtained from geophysical interferometers which normally use mirrors attached to the ground .",
    "it appears , however , that the extraction of this information from the existing g.w .",
    "laser interferometers will require certain modest modifications of their optical scheme . without compromising the astrophysical program of the instruments , these modifications seem to be possible , and we suggested several ways of doing this .",
    "their realization will allow one to use angular measurements in addition to distance measurements . in future advanced g.w .",
    "interferometers based on non - spherical mirrors these modifications may be avoided .",
    "the evaluation of interesting geophysical signals and comparison with environmental and instrumental noises shows that the g.w .",
    "instruments can reach the most ambitious geophysical goals , such for example as detection of oscillations of the inner core of earth .",
    "it seems that further progress in this area can be achieved , if a closer collaboration is established between geophysicists and representatives of g.w . community .",
