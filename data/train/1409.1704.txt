    "the assumption usually made is that @xmath73 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath70 , and that moreover it vanishes only for @xmath76 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2 ) , which in physical terms corresponds to the absence of phase transitions sending the topological charge to zero in the interval @xmath77 . actually , this is indeed the case for the models where the exact solution is known .",
