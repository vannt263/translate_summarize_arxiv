    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , during which high energy photons produced by the first luminous objects reionized the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , was an important milestone in cosmic history @xcite .",

    "the reionization history strongly constrains not only the formation of the first generation of galaxies and qsos , but also their feedback and impacts on structure formation at later times @xcite .    over the past few years",
    ", impressive progress has been made in detecting distant objects .",
    "recent observations using both broad - band colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) and narrow - band ly@xmath4 emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) have detected hundreds of galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "meanwhile , over two dozen luminous qsos have been detected at @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while it is generally believed that early star - forming galaxies played an important role in reionizing the universe @xcite , the ionization process and the actual contributions from different ionizing sources remain poorly understood .",
    "the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen has been proposed as a powerful tool to probe the eor , as it traces the thermal history of the igm and the ionization structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent advances in radio instrumentation and techniques will soon make it possible to measure the highly redshifted 21 cm line from gas during the first billion years after the big bang , as a number of radio interferometers are currently being built or planned , such as murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ? * ) , the low frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ? * ) , the precision array to probe the epoch of reionization ( paper ; * ? ? ? * ) , the giant meter - wave radio telescope ( gmrt ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the square kilometre array ( ska ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in order to understand and interpret observations from these instruments ,",
    "it is critical to understand the 21 cm structures from different ionizing sources . it has been suggested by advanced numerical simulations that the first stars ( so - called `` population iii '' stars ) started to form in mini - halos of @xmath6 as early as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the first galaxies are believed to have formed in low - metallicity halos via gas accretion or mergers around @xmath2 thanks to feedback and metal enrichment from population ( pop ) iii stars @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the massive black holes ( bhs ) may have formed from remnants of massive pop iii stars or direct collapse of gas clumps or supermassive stars ( e.g. , @xcite , leading to the emergence of the first qsos @xcite .",
    "these objects provided strong uv radiation that reionized the neutral hydrogen .    to date , a number of theoretical works have studied the 21 cm signals of pop iii stars @xcite , galaxies @xcite , and qsos @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm signal can be emission or absorption against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , if spin temperature ( @xmath8 ) is above or below the cmb temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the scattering process of @xmath0 photons is the main mechanism which causes @xmath8 decouple from @xmath9 via the wouthuysen - field effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to take into account @xmath0 scattering in the calculation of 21 cm signals . the @xmath0 radiation field in a moving medium like the hubble flow is difficult to estimate analytically , because the diffuse approximation is no longer valid in a partially ionized or moving medium with higher relative velocity @xcite , and so must be determined through detailed radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations .",
    "however , despite the importance of the wouthuysen - field effect , the @xmath0 radiation field was simply modeled or completely ignored in most of the previous work ; only a few actually included @xmath0 rt in the estimate of @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in particular , @xcite and @xcite combined cosmological simulations and post - processing @xmath0 rt to calculate the 21 cm signals from uv and x - ray sources .",
    "they found that the absorption phase of the 21 cm survives throughout the eor even in the presence of strong x - ray sources , and that the brightness temperature fluctuation of the 21 cm signal evolves strongly with redshift , with a higher amplitude in the early reionization phase .    in order to investigate the wouthuysen - field effect from different ionizing sources and the resulting 21 cm structures , we carry out here a comparative study of the ionization history of three types of sources : pop iii stars , primordial galaxies and qsos .",
    "we perform rt calculations , which include both ionization and @xmath0 scattering , on individual sources embedded in the igm .",
    "different intrinsic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) appropriate for each source type are used .",
    "we follow the evolution of the ionization structures and temperature to derive the 21 cm signals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the model and methodology underlying our simulations . in  3 , we present the results , which include the structure of ionization , temperatures and the 21 cm signal around different sources , and their time evolution .",
    "we discuss in  4 the detectability of the 21 cm structures of these sources by upcoming facilities such as mwa , lofar and ska , and we summarize in  5 .",
    "in this work , we carry out rt calculations that include ionization and @xmath0 scattering on three types of ionizing sources embedded in the igm : pop iii stars , galaxies , and qsos . the igm is modeled as spherical shells around the source .",
    "the boundary of the sphere is set to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of strmgren sphere , and it is linearly divided into 300 bins .    for each source type , we consider a range of masses in the redshift range @xmath12 . for pop iii stars , @xmath13 ; for galaxies , @xmath14 , and for qsos , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is total stellar mass . for pop iii stars with @xmath17 , we assume multiple star formation of @xmath18 in a halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or a cluster of halos with pop iii stars .",
    "the fluctuation in 21 cm intensity ( or fluctuation of brightness temperature ) from different regions of the igm at a given redshift @xmath19 depends sensitively on the gas properties , including density , velocity gradients , gas temperature , gas spin temperature and ionization state @xcite .",
    "we follow the procedure of previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which calculate the fluctuation of the brightness temperature as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath22 is over density , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the gas spin and cmb temperature respectively .",
    "the igm is assumed to be uniform , i.e. , @xmath23 , as recent simulations suggest small clumpiness in the igm at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the gradient of the proper velocity is not considered in this work .",
    "the gas spin temperature is controlled by thomson scattering of cmb photons , @xmath0 photon pumping , and collisions by the gas particles , as formulated by @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the color temperature of the @xmath0 line , @xmath26 is the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the coupling coefficients by @xmath0 photon scattering and gas collision respectively , which are calculated for each spherical shell from rt simulations of ionizing and @xmath0 photons as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the spontaneous emission factor of the 21 cm transition , @xmath32 is the number of scatterings of @xmath0 photons per atom per second , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the de - excitation rates due to collision with neutral atoms , protons , and electrons , respectively .",
    "we use the fitting formula given by @xcite and @xcite for the de - excitation rates .",
    "since @xmath25 quickly settles into @xmath26 owing to the recoil effect of @xmath0 photon scattering , @xmath36 is assumed in our calculations .",

    "we consider different seds for the three types of sources , popiii stars , galaxies , and qsos in our calculations . for popiii stars , we assume a black body spectrum , and follow the formulae from @xcite to calculate the effective temperature and bolometric luminosity of a star with mass @xmath38 : @xmath39 haloes hosting pop iii stars can be metal - enriched quickly due to type - ii or pair - instability supernovae @xcite . as a result , metallicity can exceed the threshold of pop iii star formation , @xmath40 @xcite , and then pop ii stars form in halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , recent simulations showed that multiple pop iii stars form in each halo @xcite , and haloes are clustered close together @xcite . in addition , if the mass of pop iii stars is @xmath41 , they collapse directly into black holes @xcite , as a result , the halo can keep making pop iii stars even after several myr .",
    "hence , in this work , we assume pop iii halos which consist of pop iii stars alone .",
    "effects of mixed systems of pop iii and pop ii stars on 21 cm signal will be investigated by detailed hydrodynamics simulations in future work .",
    "the primordial galaxies in our model are assumed to consist of only young , metal - poor stars which follow a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite .",
    "we assume a stellar age of 10 myr and a metallicity of @xmath42 , which are consistent with observations of high - redshift @xmath0 emitting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the seds of galaxies are then generated using the stellar population synthesis code pgase v2.0 @xcite for a given stellar mass with the above parameters of stellar age , metallicity and imf . in practice , the sed changes with evolution time .",
    "however , the star formation history of high - redshift galaxies is as yet poorly understood . in this work , for simplicity",
    ", we use the above sed with constant age , metallicity and stellar mass . note that",
    ", however , even if we consider an evolving sed with a constant star formation model like @xmath43 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the differences of sizes of hii bubbles are within a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "the sed of qsos is estimated by adding a broken power - law spectrum of massive black holes to the galaxy s sed .",
    "the power - law spectrum is assumed , following @xcite , to be @xmath45 recent observations of the most distant qsos show that the bh accretion rates are close to the eddington limit @xcite , and simulations of early qsos by @xcite showed that the mass ratio of bhs to stars in the hosts is @xmath46 , similar to that of local galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in our qso model , the bh mass is set to be @xmath47 , and its luminosity is derived assuming an eddington limit . for ionization and heating , we integrate the above sed up to @xmath48 .",
    "contribution of higher - energy photons @xmath49 is negligible because of the small energy fraction and low ionization cross section .",
    "in addition , free electrons made by x - ray ionization are highly energetic , and they make @xmath0 photons via collisions with neutral hydrogen .",
    "roughly 40 per cent of x - ray energy can be used for the production of @xmath0 photons , and they can enhance the 21 cm signal @xcite .",
    "we also include the additional @xmath0 photons by converting 40 per cent of x - ray energy at @xmath50 .",
    "the seds of these three types of sources are shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "pop iiii stars have a hard sed with a peak at @xmath51 .",
    "the sed of galaxies drops sharply at wavelengths shortward of the lyman limit @xmath52 , while that of qso has a power - law tail from x - rays to the lyman limit owing to radiation from an accreting bh . as we will show later",
    ", the difference in the seds at @xmath53 would result in different ionization structures of hydrogen by the three ionizing sources . on the other hand ,",
    "both galaxies and qsos have much higher continuum flux between @xmath0 and ly@xmath54 frequencies than pop iii stars , which would lead to stronger effects of @xmath0 scattering .     at @xmath55 .",
    "the three vertical dashed lines indicate the wavelengths of heiii , heii and hii , respectively . ]",
    "we calculate the ionization of hydrogen and helium in the igm by central sources using one - dimensional rt of ionizing photons .",
    "recent simulations showed that the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath56 ) of high - redshift galaxies or pop iii halos can be @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "hence , we simply assume that half of ionizing photons are absorbed by the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the rest escape from halos and ionize igm .",
    "about 0.68 of ionizing photons absorbed by ism or igm are converted to @xmath0 photons via recombination processes . here",
    "we ignore detailed ionization structure in halos of which the spatial scale is much smaller than the typical size of hii bubbles in the igm .",
    "in addition , we focus on the early phase when the radiation field is localized , hence the radiation background from external sources is not included .",
    "the time evolution of the ionization of hydrogen and helium is estimated by the following equations : @xmath58 here , @xmath21 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the ionization fractions of neutral hydrogen , neutral helium , ionized hydrogen and ionized helium , respectively , @xmath62 is the electron density , @xmath63 is the case b recombination rate , @xmath64 is the collisional ionization rate .",

    "we follow the evolution of ionization and temperature up to @xmath82 , and we calculate the @xmath0 radiation field and the 21 cm signal of the snapshots at @xmath83 and @xmath84 yr . our fiducial runs use the snapshot at @xmath85 yr at redshift @xmath86 .",
    "the rt of @xmath0 photons in igm is a highly complex process .",
    "it depends strongly on the @xmath0 resonant scattering , and on the density distribution and ionization state of the medium .",
    "the frequency change resulting from the scattering is difficult to estimate analytically .",
    "@xcite has developed a three - dimensional , monte carlo @xmath0 rt code which couples the continuum and ionization of hydrogen .",

    "we consider @xmath0 photons from both continuum radiation of sources and recombination processes in ionized ism and igm .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath0 luminosity is estimated by @xmath98 where the continuum spectrum is considered in the frequency range from the @xmath0 line ( @xmath99 ) to lyman limit ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath101 is the absorption fraction in the calculation boxes , @xmath102 is the conversion fraction to @xmath0 photons via the cascade decay from higher quantum levels to the ground state @xcite , and @xmath103 is the @xmath0 frequency .",
    "the @xmath0 from ism is simply proportional to number of absorbed ionizing photons because of short recombination time - scale in ism , while that from igm depends on the volume of the ionized bubble @xmath104 and the density of the ionized hydrogen and electrons .",
    "photons in this continuum range can be absorbed by neutral hydrogen which is then excited to higher levels of the lyman series , and some of hydrogen atoms can transit from the 2p to the 1s state by emitting @xmath0 photons .",
    "since we focus on the early phase of ionization up to @xmath105  yr in this work , which is shorter than the recombination time scale in igm ( @xmath106 ) , the ionized volume @xmath104 in equation  [ eq : la ] is generally smaller than the strmgren sphere at ionization equilibrium .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 emission from igm is much smaller than the other components .",
    "the @xmath0 emission from ism is dominant for pop iii stars due to the high effective temperature , while the contribution of the continuum radiation is dominant for galaxies and qsos .",

    "we performed a convergence test and found an optimal number of photon packets for the rt calculations , @xmath108 , of which the number of @xmath0 photons @xmath109 . in these calculations , since we need to estimate the rate of scattering of @xmath0 photons in each shell precisely to derive the spin temperature , we can not use the `` core skipping '' technique in the @xmath0 rt which can accelerate the calculation , as used in most @xmath0 rt simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "total energy of these photons is larger than that of the recombination photons in the cases of galaxies and qsos .",
    "unlike the @xmath0 photons from the recombination process , the continuum photons can travel for long distances until they are absorbed at the lyman series frequencies after cosmological redshifting @xcite .",

    "in addition , note that we have ignored uv background radiation in this work .",
    "if there is uv background radiation and @xmath121 becomes @xmath207 at everywhere , even igm far from sources will show emission or absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to a uniform 21 cm signal over the whole sky , and makes the identification of individual sources difficult .",
    "for such a case , only high - redshift qsos can be identified via detection of giant holes in 21 cm sky map @xcite .",
    "in addition , the x - ray background made by black holes and supernovae affects the 21 cm signal by heating the igm @xcite .",
    "the strength of uv and x - ray background depends on the cosmic star formation history and the formation of massive black holes , which are still under the debate .",
