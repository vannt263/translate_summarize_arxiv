    "the origin of the unusual behavior observed in anomalous materials is the presence of two characteristics length scales . while non anomalous liquids can be described on the framework of the van der waals one length scale potential , anomalous materials exhibit two characteristic scales .",

    "in this paper we addressed two questions related to the flow of fluids under nanoconfinement .",
    "first , we showed that the flow increase related to the change from solvophobic to solvophilic only happens if the particles and wall are not commensurated or if the flow occurs in a single line , what favors decorrelation with the wall .",
    "this effect is observed both for water - line and lj type of flow .",
    "then , we compared the flow of water - like with lj line fluid in order o understand the reason behind the faster flow of water when compared with non anomalous fluids as gases .",
    "our results indicates that water - like fluids employ the two length scales to form more compact structures decreasing friction and allowing for a faster mobility .",
