    "the most direct way of measuring the imf is by stellar counts , a technique that can be applied only within a limited distance from us . on the other hand , much of galaxy properties  at low as well as at high redshift ",
    "depend on the imf , including mass - to - light ratios , derived star - formation rates , feedback , metal enrichment , etc .",
    "considering these properties enables us to gather strong constraints on the imf for stellar systems and astrophysical situations that can not be probed by stellar counts , and provides _ sanity checks _ for assumptions and theories of the imf . in this talk",
    "i present the constraints on the imf slope below @xmath5 , between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and between @xmath6 and @xmath8 that come respectively from the observed values of the @xmath0 ratio of local elliptical galaxies , from the redshift evolution of the fundamental plane , and from the observed mass of heavy elements in clusters of galaxies .",
    "i will also emphasize the role played by the imf in our attempts at mapping the cosmic history of star formation , and the build up of the overall stellar mass content of the universe .",
    "the parameters of the _ concordance cosmology _ are adopted throughout this paper , i.e. , @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "1 shows as a function of age the @xmath0 ratio for simple stellar populations ( ssp ) , i.e. , assembly of coeaval stars all of the same ( solar ) chemical composition .",
    "ssp models are from maraston ( 1998 ) , while the use of other models would give essentially the same result .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio varies wildly depending on the assumed imf , which in this case is described by a single slope power law @xmath12 for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 corresponds to the _ salpeter _ imf ( salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "note that very large mass - to - light ratios are obtained for either very steep ( @xmath15 ) or very flat ( @xmath16 ) imfs . in the former case",
    "the total stellar mass is dominated by the huge number of low mass stars , i.e. , the imf is * dwarf dominated*. in the latter case instead ( at late times ) most stellar mass is locked into remnants : black holes , neutron stars and white dwarfs , while low mass stars contribute very little to the mass budget , i.e. , the top - heavy imf leads to a * remnant dominated * mass .",
    "of the three choices , the _ salpeter _ slope gives the lowest values of @xmath0 .",
    "yet , at an age of @xmath17 gyr , appropriate for the the bulk stellar population of elliptical galaxies , corresponding to an age of @xmath18 gyr ( for an extensive review see renzini 1999 ) .",
    "] , the @xmath0 ratio is a factor @xmath19 too high compared to the stellar mass of ellipticals as derived dynamically ( e.g. van der marel 1991 ) .",
    "this excludes any single - slope imf , hence the imf must flatten with respect to the _ salpeter _ value below @xmath20 , as indeed indicated by all direct stellar count in disk and bulge fields and in stellar clusters alike , and extensively reported at this meeting . for example , assuming @xmath14 for @xmath21 and @xmath16 for @xmath22 the @xmath0 ratio is reduced by about a factor of 2 , thus bringing ssp models in agreement with the observed values .",

    "as is well known , elliptical galaxies tightly cluster around a plane in the space having for coordinates the central velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 ) , the effective radius ( @xmath25 ) and the effective surface brightness ( @xmath26 ) ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) . this",
    "_ fundamental plane _ ( fp ) combines two structural / dynamical quantities ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) with the third ( @xmath26 ) which instead depends on luminosity , hence on the stellar population content of the galaxy and in particular on its age .",
    "the slope of the imf controls the rate of luminosity evolution of a ssp .",
    "the flatter the imf the faster the luminosity decline past a burst of star formation . on the contrary ,",
    "the steeper the imf the slower such decline , as the light from the larger number of low - mass stars compensates for the progressive death of the more massive stars .",
    "as we look to higher and higher redshift ellipticals , we therefore expect them to depart from the local fp by an amount that depends on the slope of the imf .",
    "thus , if small ellipticals were to have a different imf slope w.r.t .",
    "large ellipticals , with increasing redshift one would expect the small ellipticals to depart from the local fp by a different amount w.r.t .",
    "large ellipticals : the fp would * rotate * with increasing redshift ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ) .",
    "2 shows that ellipticals in a cluster at @xmath27 and another at @xmath28 ( corresponding to a lookback time of @xmath29 gyr , or @xmath30 the age of the universe ) align parallel to the fp defined by ellipticals in the coma cluster ( wuyts et al .",
    "2003 ) : * the fp does not rotate * , hence there is no appreciable trend of the imf with galaxy size , mass , or luminosity .    -0.6 truecm    -5 truemm    the shift in the fp shown in fig .",
    "2 actually corresponds to a change in the @xmath31 ratio of the observed galaxies , and fig .",
    "3 shows such a change for the two mentioned clusters , plus a few others at various redshifts , including one at @xmath32 ( van dokkum & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "cluster @xmath24 was measured for only two galaxies , and given the errors the slope of the fp could not be reliably measured , so only the zero - point shift is shown here . ]",
    "overplotted is also shown the evolution with redshift of the @xmath0 ratio of ssp models ( from maraston 1998 ) having assumed the ssps formed at @xmath33 .",
    "the various @xmath0 ratios have been normalized to their value at @xmath34 , so as vto emphasize their relative change with redshift .    -1.4 truecm    -5 truemm    -3 truemm    at @xmath34 elliptical galaxies @xmath17 gyr old harbour stellar populations with @xmath1 stars at the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) .",
    "by @xmath35 the precursors of such populations have an age of only @xmath36 gyr , and correspondingly a higher mass at the msto , but not by much so .",
    "specifically , the msto mass at an age of @xmath36 gyr is @xmath37 , and therefore by following the evolution of the fp with redshift up to @xmath38 ( or equivalently of the mass - to - light ratio ) we explore the imf slope within the rather narrow mass interval @xmath39 . in practice , we measure the slope of the imf near @xmath40",
    ".    note that in fig .",
    "3 a _ salpeter _",
    "imf provides a decent , yet not perfect fit to the data . on the other hand , at each redshift the @xmath0 ratio depends on the assumed age of the ssp , hence on the assumed redshift of formation @xmath41 .",
    "this means that to some extent the imf slope and the formation redshift are degenerate .",
    "indeed , the _ salpeter _ imf provides a better fit to the fp shifts if one assumes a lower formation redshift , e.g. @xmath42 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 .    of course",
    ", the higher the redshift , the larger the difference between the @xmath0 ratios predicted by ssps with different imf slopes .",
    "therefore , measuring the fp shift at the highest possible redshift would be of great interest . for quite many years",
    "the highest redshift elliptical galaxy known was lbds 53w091 at @xmath43 ( dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; spinrad et al .",
    "1997 ) , not much beyond the highest redshift ellipticals in the study by van dokkum & stanford ( 2003 ) , which are at @xmath32 .",
    "however , passively evolving elliptical galaxies have now been identified all the way to @xmath44 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2004 ) , for which it would be very interesting to measure the central velocity dispersion , thus getting the fp parameters , although this may require extremely long integrations .",
    "-2.1 truecm    -5 truemm    to further illustrate the case of the imf slope/@xmath41 degeneracy , fig .",
    "5 shows the fp ( @xmath0 ) shift with redshift for ssps with a _ salpeter _",
    "imf , solar metallicity , and various formation redshifts @xmath41 .",
    "one can conclude that the degeneracy is strong if the formation redshift of ellipticals were to be relatively low ( e.g. , @xmath19 ) , but for @xmath45 the degeneracy is quite mild and the data favor an imf slope for @xmath39 very close to the _ salpeter _ value .",
    "in clusters of galaxies most of the light comes from early - type galaxies dominated by old stellar populations , i.e. , from @xmath47 stars .",
    "meanwhile , one can also measure the amount ( mass ) of metals contained in the intracluster medium and in the stars . as most metals are produced by type ii supernovae ,",
    "the total metal mass in a cluster of galaxies is proportional to the number of massive stars ( @xmath48 ) that have exploded in the far past , therefore dispersing the metals we see today .",
    "it follows that the _ metal - mass - to - light ratio _ of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , renzini 2003 ) provides a measure of the number ratio of massive to @xmath49 stars , i.e. , of the imf slope between @xmath6 and @xmath50 ( or more ) , i.e. , the overall yield can be approximated by the total number of type ii supernovae times the nucleosynthesis products of a 25@xmath51 star .",
    "] for the stellar populations that  when young  have produced the metals and now  that are old  produce the light we see today .",
    "-1.4 truecm    -5 truemm    the imf of a passively evolving ssp can be written as :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is its @xmath54-band luminosity and @xmath55 is a ( slow ) function of the ssp age and metallicity .",
    "for example , for @xmath56 one has @xmath57 and 2.51 , respectively for @xmath58 and 15 gyr ( maraston 1998 ) ( with @xmath59 and @xmath53 in solar units ) .",
    "more recent models ( maraston 2004 , in preparation ) give @xmath60 and 2.8 for the same @xmath61 and @xmath62 and 3.94 for @xmath63 . for @xmath64 gyr ( the minimum age for @xmath45 ) the new maraston models give @xmath65 and 3.12 , respectively for @xmath66 and @xmath63 .    therefore , the metal - mass - to - light ratio for the `` x '' element can be calculated in a straightforward manner from : @xmath67    -1.8 truecm    -8 truemm    where @xmath68 is the mass of the element `` x '' which is produced by a star of mass @xmath59 .",
    "adopting @xmath69 and @xmath68 for oxygen and silicon from woosley and weaver ( 1995 ) and integrating eq .",
    "( 2 ) one obtains the _ oxygen- _ and the _ silicon - mass - to - light ratios _ , which are shown in fig .",
    "6 as a function of the imf slope .",
    "as expected , the @xmath70 and @xmath71 ratios are extremely sensitve to the imf slope .",
    "the values observed in clusters of galaxies ( icm plus galaxies ) are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively for oxygen and silicon of the stellar mass in clusters is not bound to individual galaxies ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "2003 ; gal - yam et al .",
    "( e.g. , finoguenov et al .",
    "2003 ; portinari et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "these empirical values are reported in fig .",
    "6 , which at the meeting was presented to ed salpeter as a happy - birthday postcard . indeed , with the _ salpeter",
    "_ imf slope ( @xmath14 ) the standard explosive nucleosynthesis from type ii supernovae produces just the right amount of oxygen and silicon to account for the observed @xmath70 and @xmath71 ratios in cluster of galaxies , having assumed that most of the cluster @xmath54-band light comes from @xmath74 gyr stellar populations .",
    "6 also shows that with @xmath16 such a _ top heavy _",
    "imf ( in various circumstances invoked to ease discrepancies between theories and observations ) would overproduce metals by more than a factor of 20 .",
    "this is indeed the change one expects in @xmath70 , @xmath71 , etc . for a @xmath75 when considering that the light @xmath53 is provided by @xmath76 stars and the metals by @xmath8 stars .",
    "as is well known , all sfr indicators ( uv continuum , h@xmath77 , sub - mm , etc . ) measure the formation rate of massive stars . to derive the total sfr an imf ( slope and shape )",
    "has to be assumed .",
    "similarly , an imf must be assumed to derive the total stellar mass of a galaxy from its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and luminosity .",
    "these are indeed determined by the number of stars producing the bulk of the light ( which are typically in a quite narrow range of masses ) , while remnants and dwarfs produce little light but may contribute a major fraction of the mass .",
    "it follows that the time integral of the measured cosmic sfr(@xmath78 ) ( in @xmath79yr@xmath80mpc@xmath80 ) should agree with the measured stellar mass density @xmath81 ( in @xmath79mpc@xmath80 ) , and in turn at @xmath34 this should agree with its dynamical estimate .",
    "clearly , such a general agreement needs to be achieved with the _ right _ value of the imf .",
    "7 shows a recent attempt in this direction ( adopting a salpeter imf , fontana et al .",
    "2004 ) but error bars are still too large to allow a definitive answer . however , several galaxy surveys ( with hst , sst , vlt , etc . etc . )",
    "are now well under way , and extremely rapid progress is expected in this field .",
    "the imf of elliptical galaxies is close to _ salpeter _ except below                    age ( ! ) .",
    "i would like to thank claudia maraston for having provided her most recent models in advance of publication , and the staff of the carnegie observatories ( pasadena ) for their kind hospitality during the time when this paper was written and set up .",
