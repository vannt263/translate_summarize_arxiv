    "deep imaging in the optical and near - ir has made it possible to constrain both the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1996 ) and its time integral , the growth of the cosmic stellar mass density ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "short - wavelength studies give an incomplete picture of these trends , however , since an important population of high - redshift galaxies is too obscured to be easily detected .",
    "these submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; see blain et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) have large ir luminosities that are predominantly generated by star formation rather than accretion @xcite ; as a result , they contribute substantially to cosmic star formation @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the strikingly different appearances of the hubble deep field at @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite exemplify , smgs are rarer and forming stars much more intensely than typical optically selected systems .    to understand the evolutionary state of smgs , we have conducted a detailed rest - frame optical case study using spiffi , the spectrometer for infrared faint field imaging @xcite .",
    "our target is smmj14011 + 0252 ( hereafter j14011 ) , a @xmath3 galaxy lying behind the @xmath7 cluster a1835 and the second smg to have an optical counterpart identification @xcite validated by co interferometry @xcite .",
    "recent maps of j14011 s molecular gas have led to divergent conclusions about its intrinsic size : @xcite suggest that a large background source undergoes a factor @xmath8 magnification by a1835 as a whole , while @xcite argue that a fortuitously located cluster member further boosts magnification of a small background source to @xmath9 .",
    "we defer a full discussion of lensing to a future paper ; here , we focus primarily on the lensing - independent conclusions of high age and metallicity that can be drawn from j14011 s global spectrum alone . throughout the paper we assume a flat @xmath10 cosmology with @xmath11 .",
    "in three spiffi `` guest instrument '' runs between february and april 2003 , we observed j14011 in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands on kueyen ( ut2 of the eso vlt ) .",
    "weather conditions were extremely stable within and between nights , and the near - ir seeing was better than @xmath12 .",
    "spiffi obtains simultaneous spectra for all pixels in a @xmath13 array ; our data were obtained with the @xmath14 pixel scale , and with spectral resolving power @xmath15 at @xmath16 , @xmath17 at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 at @xmath20 . individual exposure times in the three bands were 10 , 5 , and 10 minutes , respectively ; we obtained an `` off '' frame at a sky position ( offset by @xmath21 ) for each `` on '' frame , and jittered the telescope by two - pixel offsets between the `` on '' frames themselves .",
    "the total on - source integration times were 60 minutes in @xmath0 , 95 minutes in @xmath1 , and 340 minutes in @xmath2 .",
    "we reduced the data within iraf using modified versions of long - slit spectroscopy tools . after subtracting dark frames and flat - fielding all data ( object and sky frames )",
    ", we masked out bad pixels and interpolated new values using all available three - dimensional information .",
    "object and sky frames were then wavelength calibrated using arc lamp spectra and/or night sky emission lines .",
    "the `` off '' sky frames were then subtracted , and a linear fit to the background was subtracted across each spectral and spatial row of the data . at this point the data cubes for each on - off pair were reconstructed , using only integer pixel shifts and assuming that each spatial row of the field covered exactly 32 pixels ; although this was not strictly correct , it only slightly reduced the spatial resolution and avoided loss of signal - to - noise due to resampling .",
    "a final background subtraction exploited the two - dimensional field of view : objects in the frame were masked out , and the mean of the remaining pixels in a given wavelength plane was subtracted from that plane . using telescope offsets , we spatially aligned and then combined the data cubes , clipping any deviant pixels in each cell .",
    "telluric correction was applied to the final merged cubes .",
    "fluxes were calibrated by integrating spiffi observations of the ukirt faint standard fs135 only over the mauna kea observatory @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 filter bandpasses ; the reference photometry of fs135 itself has a scatter of less than 1% @xcite .",
    "figure [ f - maps ] shows j14011 in continuum - subtracted @xmath22 and line - free @xmath2-band continuum . within the bright eastern `` j1 '' component ,",
    "the spiffi data reveal substantial spatial variation in @xmath22 equivalent width : nebular emission is strongest away from the central continuum peak . after using this peak to align all three data cubes",
    ", we extracted a spectrum of j1 from the @xmath23 region shown in figure [ f - maps ] .",
    "this box encloses about two thirds of the total continuum associated with j1 in the @xmath2-band cube , and virtually all the emission we detect in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ f - jhkspec ] shows the result and reveals that j14011 has a continuum break between the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "the lack of a similar break in blank - sky spectra extracted from elsewhere in the spiffi field proves that this can not be an artifact of poor sky subtraction ; the @xmath24 color of fs135 , meanwhile , is accurate to 0.3% @xcite . the feature s most likely origin is the balmer break of a @xmath4 old stellar population at @xmath25 .",
    "quantitatively , the strength of the break can be reproduced by a population synthesis model constructed with the stars package @xcite for a 200myr old episode of continuous star formation with a @xmath26 salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , solar metallicity , and an extinction @xmath27 .",
    "a crucial implication of this result is that the near - ir continuum emission must be dominated by the high - redshift background source , rather than by a foreground cluster galaxy .",
    "we have also used the spectrum in figure [ f - jhkspec ] to measure fluxes and centroids for eleven nebular emission lines ; taken together , they imply j1 has a systemic redshift @xmath28 , in perfect agreement with the @xmath29 derived from millimeter interferometry @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 emission from the fainter western `` j2 '' component is blueshifted by @xmath30 with respect to j1 , consistent with the offset measured by @xcite from rest - uv spectra .",
    "the j1 line fluxes allow us to measure the @xmath31 estimator for its oxygen abundance @xcite . after correcting for reddening with a galactic extinction curve @xcite and the color excess @xmath32 implied by the balmer decrement , and fixing @xmath33",
    ", we derive @xmath34 .",
    "translation of this index to an oxygen abundance depends on ionization parameter , as quantified by @xmath35 . using the fits of kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno ( 1999 ) to the calibrations of @xcite",
    ", we infer that @xmath36 .",
    "relative to the measurement of allende  prieto , lambert , & asplund ( 2001 ) , this represents an abundance that is supersolar by @xmath37 .",
    "a high [ ] /@xmath22 ratio means j14011 can not fall on the lower - metallicity branch of the [ o / h ] vs. @xmath31 relation .",
    "although we reserve a full lensing model of j14011 for a future paper , our spiffi data already allow us to evaluate the small source / high @xmath38 and large source / low @xmath39 scenarios .",
    "as noted above , the strength of the apparent balmer break in j1 leaves little room for continuum emission from an `` extra '' lensing galaxy in a1835 . the newly confirmed velocity difference between j1 and j2 , on top of @xmath40 and ciii ] @xmath41 equivalent width differences in their published spectra @xcite , indicates that these components are not multiple images of the same background source , contrary to the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "finally , spiffi spatially resolves j1 in an east - west direction ; the observed @xmath42 fwhm of @xmath22 emission exceeds the @xmath43 east - west psf dimension .",
    "this would not occur if j1 were formed from the merging of a triple image set .",
    "these direct arguments for a low lensing magnification are nicely complemented by the wealth of self - consistent evidence that j14011 as a whole has a large mass and age .",
    "our estimate of j1 s high oxygen abundance is independent of @xmath39 , provided there is minimal differential lensing from 3726 to @xmath44 rest wavelength . for a closed - box model with solar yield",
    ", this metallicity corresponds to a gas / baryonic mass fraction of @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite measure a @xmath46 co(32 ) line luminosity for j14011 . for gas that is dense and warm enough to produce detectable co(76 ) emission ,",
    "@xcite suggest that molecular gas mass and co luminosity are related by @xmath47 .",
    "adopting @xmath48 as a fiducial value for the cluster - only lensing case , we infer a molecular gas mass @xmath49 , and therefore a total baryonic mass @xmath50 and stellar mass @xmath51 . this last value ( and with it , our assumption of moderate @xmath39 )",
    "is empirically supported by the mass - metallicity relation , as recently rederived by @xcite from a sample of @xmath52 galaxies at @xmath53 .",
    "their favored translation of @xmath31 to metallicity gives @xmath54 for j1 , at which the median stellar mass is @xmath55 .    for a simple closed - box model , assumption of continuous star formation and a return fraction @xmath56 uniquely sets the length of time for which a galaxy has been forming stars : @xmath57 . for j14011",
    ", @xmath58 will be independent of lensing because @xmath59 and sfr depend identically on @xmath39 .",
    "we can estimate the star formation rate in j14011 from its @xmath60 @xcite ; for the fiducial sed of @xcite with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "adjusting the conversion factor of @xcite to match a @xmath26 salpeter imf , we infer @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this age is consistent with the strength of the balmer break seen in figure [ f - jhkspec ] , suggesting that the closed - box assumption made above is not unreasonable .",
    "j14011 s powerful starburst thus appears to be converting most of its baryons into stars on a fairly rapid ( few hundred myr ) timescale .",
    "its star formation history and metallicity allow j14011 to join smmj02399 - 0136 whose @xmath67 @xcite infer from its spatially resolved gas kinematics as an smg whose large baryonic mass is secure .",
    "thanks to co confirmation of keck / lris redshifts obtained by @xcite , this category promises to expand rapidly . @xcite have published co data confirming the keck redshifts for three new smgs ; the total set of five has @xmath68 and a median co linewidth of @xmath69 ( fwhm ) .",
    "a fruitful comparison can be made between this smg sample and the well - studied lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) population at @xmath70 . in the list of sixteen lbgs for which @xcite report ionized gas kinematics ,",
    "the median velocity width is @xmath71 ( fwhm ) at a slightly larger @xmath72 . assuming that the ( few kpc ) size scales of the starbursts are comparable in lbgs and smgs , the higher velocity widths imply smgs dynamical masses should also be larger by a typical factor of 6 .",
    "if the two populations dark matter fractions are comparable , we would expect a median smg baryonic mass exceeding the median @xmath73 stellar mass estimated for 74 lbgs @xcite salpeter imf and @xmath74 .",
    "] by the same factor , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "although the strong clustering of lbgs ( e.g. , giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ) suggests they share their host halos with much more baryonic mass than is seen in their inner regions , smgs appear already to have assembled measurably larger masses of baryons , or to have been more successful in retaining those baryons in the face of energetic winds .",
    "complementary constraints on the star formation histories and metallicities of more smgs , like those obtained here for j14011 , would further strengthen this case .    in the hierarchical merging scenario for structure formation , massive galaxies are assembled in greater numbers with the passage of time .",
    "as several authors have pointed out , the observed number densities of high - redshift galaxies with large stellar masses exceed the predictions of semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution within this framework @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we can also use the number densities of smgs to apply the same `` baryonic mass assembly test '' to the models . @xcite report the surface density of smgs with @xmath76 ( the threshold above which smg optical redshifts @xmath77",
    "have been confirmed with co interferometry ) to be @xmath78 .",
    "the @xcite sample includes two ( of nine ) sources above this threshold lying at @xmath79 , and excludes the @xmath80 of bright smgs that lack radio counterparts @xcite .",
    "two of the five smgs with co detections have @xmath81 fwhm line widths that would correspond to @xmath82 by the above rescaling of lbg stellar masses .",
    "this leaves an estimated surface density of @xmath83 for smgs with baryonic masses @xmath84 in the range @xmath77 , and a comoving number density of @xmath85 .",
    "we must still correct this density upward to account for sources that are comparably massive but no longer luminous enough to have been detected at @xmath6 .",
    "adding @xmath58 and the gas exhaustion timescale @xmath86 for j14011 implies that the total duration of its current burst will be of order 250myr .",
    "relative to the 1.8gyr elapsed over the range @xmath77 , this would imply a correction factor of 7 for the population as a whole .",
    "figure [ f - bmat ] plots this prediction , together with the comoving number densities of galaxies with stellar masses above the @xmath87 threshold at @xmath88 @xcite and @xmath89 @xcite . also plotted are the predictions of semi - analytic models , one of which is taken from @xcite and the other an update of @xcite . since all theoretical and observational values assume the same cosmology and a consistent ( either miller - scalo or @xmath26 salpeter ) imf , we are secure in concluding that the models underpredict the number densities of massive galaxies at @xmath90 . couching figure [ f - bmat ] in terms of _ mass",
    "_ emphasizes that the observed surface densities of smgs can not be explained using a very flat imf alone .",
    "we also note that the models contain sufficiently many dark halos of total mass @xmath91 to account for the observed number densities of massive smgs , provided their baryons can be rapidly and efficiently assembled into galaxies .    correcting the observed number density of smgs to account for their less dust - luminous descendants raises",
    "the question of what types of galaxies smgs can plausibly evolve into .",
    "although lbgs are clearly excluded due to their smaller masses , an intriguing alternative is the newly identified population whose red @xmath92 colors can stem from a strong balmer break at @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies appear to be strongly clustered @xcite and assuming a uniform distribution in the redshift range @xmath94 @xcite have a comoving number density @xmath95 .",
    "relatively few sources with @xmath96 also have 1.2 mm flux densities @xmath97 ( dannerbauer et al .",
    "2004 ) , indicating little direct overlap with the _ bright _ end of the smg population ( see also frayer et al .",
    "2004 ) , although fainter ( sub)millimeter counterparts may still be present ( e.g. , wehner , barger , & kneib 2002 ) . with three examples in the hdf - s having ( for a miller - scalo imf ) stellar masses @xmath98 @xcite , it would seem plausible that the more luminous objects with red @xmath99 colors at this epoch could have passed through an smg phase at higher redshift .",
