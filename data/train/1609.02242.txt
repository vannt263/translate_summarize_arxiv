    "this spin accumulation in turn exerts a torque on the magnetization of an adjoining ferromagnetic ( fm ) layer or fm dopants which may be used to switch the magnetization direction for magnetic memory @xcite applications . besides the more traditional picture that the spin accumulation exerts a torque via exchange coupling on the magnetization by acting like an effective magnetic field",
    ", it has also been proposed recently that the alignment of the spin on the fm side of the fm - ti interface on a fm - ti heterostructure to the spin accumulation direction on the ti side of the interface and the subsequent diffusion of the spin across the thickness of the fm layer may also contribute to the spin torque @xcite .",
    "spin torques in magnetized ti systems have recently been measured experimentally , both in heterostructures with a fm layer deposited on top of the ti @xcite as well as in magnetically doped tis @xcite .",

    "ti thin films @xcite differ from the more commonly studied semi - infinite slabs in that they possess both a top as well as a bottom surface where the surface states localized on both surfaces can couple to one another due to the finite thickness . from the device point of view , thinner ti films offer the advantage that their larger surface area to volume ratios enhance the contribution of the more practically useful surface states relative to the bulk states . from a theoretical point of view the simultaneous presence of the inter - surface coupling and",
    "in - plane magnetization leads to two distinct topological phases depending on whether the inter - surface coupling is stronger than the in - plane magnetization @xcite .",
    "we have earlier studied the spin accumulation in ti thin films subjected to an in - plane magnetization due to an in - plane electric field in the absence of disorder @xcite .",
    "( in contrast , the works on electric field induced spin accumulation in semi - infinite bulk tis have focused on out - of - plane magnetizations and treated the in - plane magnetization perturbatively . ) here we extend our previous study to include the effects of disorder scattering and vertex corrections , and use more realistic material parameters .",

    "[ ga789 ] and [ ga1011 ] the spin accumulations in the weak and strong inter - layer coupling regimes respectively for various thicknesses of thin film with the same parameters as in the earlier figures .",

    "this is due to the dependence of the fermi velocity @xmath199 and inter - layer coupling strength @xmath80 appearing in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ ham0 ] with the film thickness . in general",
    ", the maximum magnitude of the spin accumulations increase with decreasing thickness of the film .",
    "an interesting exception is for the @xmath129 and @xmath180 accumulations where the sign of the spin accumulation for the largest thickness depicted is reversed relative to that at smaller thicknesses .",
    "in this work we calculated the spin accumulation due to an in - plane electric field on the top and bottom surfaces of a ti thin film with an in - plane magnetization .",
    "we described the numerical scheme for this calculation incorporating disorder scattering in the first born approximation and vertex corrections at the ladder level .",
    "we distinguished between the two cases where the in - plane magnetization is stronger , and where it is weaker , than the inter - surface coupling . in the first case ,",
    "the states localized at the top and bottom surfaces give two distinct dirac cones near the charge neutrality point whereas in the second case there are no longer two distinct cones and a bandgap opens up .",
    "we then showed that these bandstructure differences give rise to different qualitative trends in the spin accumulation as the fermi energy is varied . in the weak inter - surface coupling regime",
    "the spin accumulation exhibits two distinct peaks as the fermi energy is increased beyond the charge neutrality point corresponding to the band top of the lower energy band and the band bottom of the higher energy band at @xmath101 . in the strong inter - surface coupling regime",
    "the spin accumulation is zero when the fermi energy falls inside the band gap and exhibits a kink when the energy is increased beyond the @xmath101 band bottom of the higher energy band .",
    "we showed and explained why the @xmath180 and @xmath129 spin accumulations are antisymmetric with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "these two quantities , which correspond to the sum of the spin accumulations on the top and bottom surfaces of the film , acquire finite values only when the symmetry between the top and bottom surfaces is broken so that the contributions from the two surfaces , which are of opposite signs , do not cancel out exactly .",
    "we showed that the impurity scattering and vertex corrections , in general , reduce the magnitude of the spin accumulation except at some values of fermi energies where the magnitude is low in which case the sign of the spin accumulation may flip .",
    "the magnitude of the peak spin accumulation increases with decreasing thickness of the thin film .",
