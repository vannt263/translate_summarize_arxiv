    "stratified shear flow instabilities occur in a variety of physical contexts such as astrophysics @xcite , the earth s atmosphere and oceanography @xcite .",
    "the linear instability problem of stratified shear flows has been addressed in a large body of literature . since the original work of helmholtz @xcite and lord kelvin @xcite many models of flows and density stratifications have been investigated both analytically and numerically .",
    "parameterized by the global richardson number , these investigations have resulted in a large variety of stability / instability domains in the richardson number - wavenumber space @xcite .",
    "however , a full understanding of this large variety of stability domains does not exist .",
    "a step towards understanding a particular aspect of shear flow instability was achieved by holmboe @xcite . using a piece - wise - linear form of the velocity and density profile holmboe managed to distinguish between two classes of unstable modes that are present in stratified shear flows . in the first class",
    "the unstable modes have zero phase velocity in a reference frame of zero - mean velocity and exist for a finite range of strength of the stratification ( richardson number ) .",
    "this instability is referred to in the literature as kelvin - helmholtz instability since the behavior of the unstable modes resembles the one predicted by kelvin - helmholtz .",
    "the unstable modes of the second class have non - zero phase velocity and typically smaller growth rate than the kelvin - helmholtz modes",
    ". however they are present for arbitrarily large values of strength of the stratification , making them better candidates to explain certain physical phenomena .",
    "this second kind of instability is referred to as holmboe instability .",
    "several authors have expanded holmboe s work @xcite by considering different stratification and velocity profiles that do not include the simplifying symmetries holmboe used in his model .",
    "discussions on the mechanisms involved in the instability can be found in @xcite .",
    "hazel @xcite and more recently smyth and peltier @xcite have shown that holmboe s results hold for smooth density and velocity profiles as long as the length scale of the density variation is sufficiently smaller than the length scale of the velocity variation .",
    "further , effects of viscosity and diffusivity @xcite , non - linear evolution @xcite and mixing properties @xcite of the holmboe instability have also been investigated .",
    "experimentally holmboe s instability has been investigated by various groups .",
    "browand and winant @xcite first performed shear flow experiments in stratified environments under the conditions that holmboe s instabilities are present .",
    "their investigation has been extended further by more recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the unstable holmboe modes have been observed and holmboe s predictions verified . in this work",
    "we examine the stability of smoothly stratified shear flows as was done in @xcite and @xcite , but here we focus on finding the kind of marginally unstable modes that comprise the stability boundaries .",
    "we show how these modes can be determined without solving the full eigenvalue problem for the complex eigenvalue @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that new instability regions exist which have not been discovered before in the literature .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ form ]",
    "we formulate the linear stability problem and discuss the possible marginally unstable modes that can comprise the stability boundaries . in section [ nummeth ]",
    "we describe the numerical methods used .",
    "section [ res ] presents our results .",
    "specifically , we show the location of the marginally unstable modes and numerically verify that they indeed constitute the stability boundaries .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ cons ] where we also give a physical description of our results .",
    "we begin with the taylor - goldstein equation , which describes linear normal modes of a parallel shear flow in a stratified , inviscid , non - diffusive , boussinesq fluid : @xmath1\\phi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the complex amplitude of the stream function for a normal mode with real wavenumber @xmath3 and complex phase velocity @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath4 implies instability with growth rate given by @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the unperturbed velocity in the @xmath7 direction and @xmath8 is the squared brunt - visla frequency .",
    "prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "we note that when @xmath0 is real and in the range of @xmath10 there is a height @xmath11 , at which @xmath12 . at the height @xmath11 , called the critical height , equation ( [ tg ] ) has a regular singular point .",
    "many of the features of the unstable modes are related to the presence of this singular point .",
    "equation ( [ tg ] ) together with the boundary conditions @xmath13 for @xmath14 , forms an eigenvalue problem for the complex eigenvalue @xmath0 .",
    "the taylor - goldstein equation ( [ tg ] ) , has been studied for many different density and velocity profiles and is known to have four different classes of modes as solutions @xcite : ( i ) for some conditions unstable modes exist with the real part of the phase velocity within the range of @xmath10 .",
    "the phase speed of these modes satisfies howard s semi - circle theorem @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , if these modes exist the miles - howard theorem @xcite guarantees that somewhere in the flow the local richardson number defined by : @xmath16^{\\,2}}\\ ] ] must be smaller than 1/4 . as discussed in the introduction , for some velocity and density profiles , the class of the unstable modes can be further divided into two subclasses of unstable modes , those whose phase velocity is zero with respect the mean flow ( kelvin - helmholtz modes ) and those whose phase velocity is non - zero , the holmboe modes .",
    "( ii ) the complex conjugates of the unstable modes constitute the second class of modes .",
    "that is , for each ( @xmath17 ) that is a solution of ( [ tg ] ) that describes an unstable mode there is a solution ( @xmath18 ) that describes a damped mode with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "( iii ) the third class of modes consists of non - singular traveling modes with phase velocity outside the range of @xmath10",
    ". these are internal gravity wave modes modified by the shear .",
    "( iv ) finally , due to the singularity at the critical height @xmath11 a continuum of singular neutral modes exist with a singular behavior of the first derivative of the steam function at the critical height .",
    "the phase velocity of these modes lies within the range of @xmath10 . for these modes",
    "an asymptotic analysis close to the critical height shows that the stream function can be written as the sum of two linearly independent solutions : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the index @xmath24 corresponds to the solution above or below the critical height .",
    "the solutions in equation ( [ asc ] ) are known as the frobenius solutions .",
    "if these modes are marginally unstable the frobenius solutions need to be considered as the limit @xmath25 and yield the connection formulas : @xmath26 for each wavenumber and fixed density and velocity profiles more than one of the above mentioned modes can exist . consequently , it is interesting to try and find boundaries , if they exist , that separate these four classes of modes .",
    "this is what we try to achieve in what follows for a specific example of shear and stratification .",
    "the example we investigate follows hazel s @xcite work where the velocity profile is given by : @xmath27 note that the problem has been is nondimensionalized using the half - thickness and the half velocity change of the shear layer . for the stratification as , in @xcite",
    ", we pick the squared brunt - visla frequency s functional form ( in nondimensional units ) to be given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 gives the non - dimensional length scale of the density stratification . the symmetry @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 implies that if ( @xmath32 ) is the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of an unstable mode , then ( @xmath33 ) is also a solution of equation ( [ tg ] ) that describes an unstable mode traveling in the opposite direction .",
    "this allows us with no loss of generality to focus only on the modes that have @xmath34 .     the local richardson number @xmath35 normalized by @xmath36 for different values of the parameter @xmath37,width=302 ]    the following observations illuminate the origin and possible location of the stability boundaries .",
    "first , as noted by hazel @xcite , for the density and velocity profile given in equations ( [ j],[u ] ) respectively , the functional form of the local richardson number crucially depends on the value of the parameter @xmath37 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the local richardson number has a unique minimum at @xmath39 given by @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that we can only have instability if @xmath41 @xcite and any stability boundary must lie within this region or on its boundary . for @xmath42 two minima",
    "exist symmetrically around zero and therefore we can have instability for values of @xmath36 larger than @xmath43 . for @xmath44 , @xmath45 obtains its minimum value for @xmath46 with @xmath47 and therefore instability can occur only if @xmath48 .",
    "finally for larger values of @xmath37 , @xmath45 decays exponentially to zero as @xmath9 becomes large and an instability might be present at arbitrarily large values of @xmath36 . in order to make the second observation we need to transform equation ( [ tg ] ) in to an alternative form . denoting @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "we can rewrite the taylor - goldstein equation as : @xmath51\\phi \\ , .\\ ] ] now ,",
    "if we invert the problem and ask the question , for a given real phase velocity @xmath0 what is the value of @xmath52 that satisfies the above equation and boundary conditions , we end up with a schrdinger problem for a particle in a potential well given by @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the resulting singular potential for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the solution of this particular problem for @xmath55 gives the stability boundary for the unstable modes given by the relation @xmath57 as shown in @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath53 in equation ( [ sch ] ) for c=0,width=302 ]    the potential @xmath53 in ( [ sch ] ) for c=1 for three different values of @xmath37 .",
    "only when @xmath58 bounded states are allowed.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows the resulting potential for @xmath59 and three values of @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 no solution exists that satisfies the boundary conditions since this problem corresponds to finding bounded states in an unbounded potential well ( @xmath62 for @xmath63 ) .",
    "however if @xmath58 we have to solve for the eigenstates / energy levels of a particle in a finite potential well . for this case",
    "a discrete number of bounded energy states with  energy levels \" @xmath64 exist .",
    "each state corresponds to a mode with @xmath59 and wavenumber @xmath65 .",
    "since the phase speed of free gravity waves is a decreasing function of wavenumber , we expect that wavenumbers smaller than @xmath66 will have @xmath67 and could possibly be unstable . of course ,",
    "whether these solutions indeed represent marginally unstable modes still needs to be demonstrated .",
    "note that marginally unstable modes with phase velocity equal to the maximum velocity of the shear flow have been reported before in the literature in interfacial gravity wave generation problems @xcite .",
    "besides the modes with @xmath59 , other neutral modes that may be marginally unstable should have @xmath0 in the range of @xmath10 and therefore must be singular .",
    "these modes can be written in terms of the asymptotic expansion in equation ( [ asc ] ) .",
    "for example let @xmath68 be the exponentially decaying solution of of the taylor - goldstein equation [ tg ] for @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the two frobenius solutions in [ asc ] ) . @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with no loss of generality ,",
    "are assumed real .",
    "the connection formulas for marginally unstable modes [ asc ] imply that below the critical layer ( @xmath74 ) the solution will be @xmath75 $ ] @xmath76.$ ] however , only one linear combination of @xmath70 and @xmath71 will give an exponentially decaying solution for @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are such that the real part of @xmath2 is decreasing exponentially to zero for @xmath77 the imaginary part of @xmath2 will increase exponentially . since both the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath78 need to satisfy the boundary conditions at infinity it seems unlikely that such a solution exists unless one of the two coefficients @xmath72 or @xmath73 is zero .",
    "therefore , a possible marginally unstable mode would be a singular mode that is proportional to only one of the two independent frobenius solutions in equation ( [ asc ] ) ( i.e. @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) .",
    "however the existence of such a solution is not guaranteed , so in addition , a suitable value of @xmath81 and @xmath82 needs to be found ( if it exists ) so that both boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "we note that the case in which the @xmath54 modes form a stability boundary corresponds to a special case of this class of marginally unstable modes .",
    "the strategy that we adopt in order to find the unstable regions is the following .",
    "first we find the location of the neutral modes described in the previous section and then investigate if these modes are indeed marginally unstable by solving for the growth rate ( or for @xmath83 ) in the neighborhood of these modes .",
    "four different numerical codes were used .",
    "each code integrates the taylor - goldstein equation ( [ tg ] ) using a fourth order runge - kutta method ( tested for different resolutions to verify convergence ) and a shooting method is used to determine the eigenvalue in the four different eigenvalue problems that we describe in more detail below @xcite .    in the first eigenvalue problem",
    "we take @xmath54 . for a given value of @xmath36",
    "we integrate the taylor - goldstein equation from zero to infinity with initial conditions given by one of the two frobenius solutions ( [ asc ] ) , and look for the eigenvalue @xmath81 such that the boundary condition at infinity is satisfied .",
    "note that for symmetry reasons , when c=0 , only the positive @xmath9-axis needs to be considered .",
    "the solution of this problem provides us with the stability boundary for the kelvin - helmholtz modes , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this problem as eigenvalue problem one .",
    "the values of @xmath36 that satisfy the condition @xmath54 for a wavenumber @xmath3 will be denoted by the curve @xmath84 .    for the second eigenvalue problem",
    "we take @xmath59 and solve the schrdinger problem for the potential @xmath85 by integrating equation ( [ sch ] ) from @xmath86 to @xmath87 and look for the eigenvalue @xmath64 for which the boundary condition at @xmath87 is satisfied ( where by @xmath88 we mean sufficiently large value of @xmath9 ) .",
    "the modes evaluated from this process are non - singular neutral modes , and form a curve in the @xmath89 plane that we denote by @xmath90 .    in the third problem we are looking for the values of @xmath0 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) and @xmath3 such that one of the two independent frobenius solutions of equation ( [ asc ] )",
    "satisfies both boundary conditions at infinity . in more detail",
    "the third code begins with an initial  guess \" of both @xmath0 and @xmath3 and integrates from the critical height both forward and backward up to some sufficiently large positive / negative value of @xmath9 .",
    "the initial conditions for @xmath78 and @xmath93 at @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 is a small deviation from the critical height ) are obtained from equation ( [ asc ] ) with either @xmath96 or @xmath97 ( both cases were tested ) and terms up to second order in the expansion are used . as argued in the previous section , only the solution that it is proportional to one of the two linearly independent solutions of ( [ asc ] )",
    "can satisfy the connection formulas across the critical layer ( for marginally unstable singular modes ) and both boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "any other linear combination of the frobenius solutions ( [ asc ] ) will lead to a singular neutral mode that does not belong to an instability boundary . since we begin with either @xmath96 or @xmath97 we",
    "are only left with two conditions to satisfy at @xmath98 and two parameters to change ( @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) . with a bisection method",
    "@xcite the code converged to a single pair of values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 . for one of the two initial conditions ( say @xmath96 ) the code converged to the @xmath59 solution , and for the second initial condition ( say @xmath97 ) the code converged to a value of @xmath0 and @xmath3 with @xmath99 .",
    "the solutions with @xmath100 comprise a class of singular neutral modes forming a curve in the @xmath89 plane that we will denote by @xmath101",
    ".    however , the existence of the above mentioned neutral modes does not guarantee that they form a stability boundary .",
    "hence , a code that solves the full eigenvalue problem for the complex eigenvalue @xmath0 was used to verify that the above mentioned neutral solutions constitute the stability boundaries .",
    "this fourth code integrates the taylor goldstein equation from @xmath102 to zero for some given values of @xmath36 and @xmath3 and a newton - raphson method is used to find the value of @xmath0 for which the two solutions match at zero .",
    "no approximation is used to cross the critical height and for this reason this code converged only for unstable modes ( im@xmath103 ) and neutral non - singular gravity waves ( @xmath104 ) . note that this code encounters problems with convergence when the examined parameters are very close to a neutral singular mode stability boundary because of the almost singular behavior in the neighborhood of the critical height that needs to be resolved .",
    "we begin with relatively small values of @xmath36 ( order unity or less ) which is the case that has been previously examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however in @xcite and @xcite the authors determined the instability boundaries in the @xmath89 plane by solving the full eigenvalue problem in the examined parameter space , finding in that way the regions with non - zero growth rates .",
    "this is a very difficult task since in order to determine the instability region , the entire @xmath89 plane needs to be mapped for every value of @xmath37 .",
    "here we use a different approach .",
    "we find the location of the neutral modes corresponding to the different eigenvalue problems described in the last section and show that these form instability boundaries by solving the complex value of the phase velocity only for a few values of the global richardson number .",

    "unstable holmboe waves exist with the real part of the phase velocity smaller than one but different from zero . in the third region ( iii )",
    "unstable kelvin - helmholtz modes are present with the real part of the phase velocity equal to zero . finally in the fourth region ( iv ) only singular neutral modes exist .",

    "further illumination of how the properties of a mode change as we increase the wavenumber is gained by looking at panels ( b , c ) of figure [ fig4 ] that show the dispersion relation ( phase velocity as a function of the wavenumber ) for two values of @xmath36 ( panel ( b ) @xmath113 and panel ( c ) @xmath115 ) .",
    "a logarithmic scale is used to focus on the details of small wave - numbers and small phase velocities . for the @xmath113 case , for small wavenumbers",

    "the phase velocity becomes complex indicating that the mode with @xmath59 belongs to the stability boundary .",
    "as we further increase the wavenumber there is a critical value @xmath122 for which the imaginary part of the phase velocity becomes zero again , with the real part of the phase velocity remaining finite and smaller than one .",

    "the small difference is attributed to the difficulty in resolving the almost singular region around @xmath11 with the fourth code when @xmath83 is very small .    for smaller values of the global richardson number ( @xmath123 )",

    "the dark line just indicates the location of the instability region based on the stability boundaries shown in figure [ fig7].,width=302 ]    we note finally that for a fixed value of @xmath36 the highest harmonic has the largest growth rate . in figure [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the growth rate @xmath160im@xmath116 as a function of the wavenumber for @xmath105 and two different values of @xmath36 .",
    "the growth rate is significantly larger for the highest harmonic .",
    "this makes the higher unstable harmonics possible to be detected experimentally , since it is the most unstable modes that are usually observed .",
    "in this paper we investigated holmboe s instability in stratified shear flows for smooth density and velocity profiles . using a specific model of the density and velocity profiles @xcite",
    ", we were able to determine the instability regions for large values of the global richardson number including regions not previously noted in the literature .",
    "focusing on the nature of the stability boundaries that enclose the holmboe unstable modes , we have shown that for moderate values of @xmath36 and when the density stratification length scale is sufficiently smaller than the shear length scale ( i.e. @xmath161 ) the ( @xmath162 ) plane is divided into four regions : ( i ) a region where neutral gravity waves exist ( i.e. modes with real phase velocity outside the range of the velocity shear ) ; ( ii ) a region where unstable traveling waves exist ( i.e. holmboe modes ) ; ( iii ) a region where unstable modes with the real part of the phase velocity being zero exist ( i.e. kelvin helmholtz modes ) ; ( iv ) and finally a region where only singular neutral modes exist .",
    "we determined the modes that comprise the boundaries and separate these four classes of modes . for small @xmath36 ( @xmath41 ) kelvin - helmholtz modes exist .",
    "they are restricted in a bounded domain enclosed by the boundary @xmath84 determined by the modes with zero phase velocity . for larger",
    "@xmath36 , a strip of holmboe unstable modes exist .",
    "this instability strip is determined by the two boundaries @xmath90 and @xmath101 . in more detail",
    ", we have demonstrated that for a given value of the global richardson number @xmath36 the unstable modes have wavenumbers @xmath3 that lie in the range @xmath114 where @xmath121 is the wavenumber of the mode that has phase velocity equal to one and satisfies @xmath163 and @xmath122 is the wavenumber of a singular marginally unstable neutral mode .",
    "@xmath122 satisfies @xmath164 .",
    "we have shown how the value of @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be determined to desired accuracy ( and therefore how to construct the boundaries @xmath118 and @xmath111 ) by solving a schrdinger eigenvalue problem for a particle in a potential well .",
    "for large values of the global richardson number more than one strip of instability may appear .",
    "each new instability strip is confined between the pair of curves @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "as before @xmath137 can be determined for a given value of @xmath36 by finding the wavenumber @xmath167 of the @xmath168th harmonic of the gravity wave spectrum with @xmath59 and @xmath142 is determined by finding the wavenumber @xmath169 of the singular marginally unstable mode that is met first as we increase the wavenumber from @xmath167 .",
    "the results of this paper show a deep connection between the free gravity wave spectrum and the holmboe unstable waves .",
    "the overall picture looks as follows . for large stratification and small wavenumbers",
    "the free gravity wave spectrum is only slightly modified by the shear and is composed of a discrete finite number @xmath133 ( @xmath170 ) of stable modes ( @xmath171 ) with @xmath135 . as the wave number is increased the phase speed decreases roughly as the square root of the wavenumber . as the phase speed approaches the maximum shear velocity ( @xmath172 ) , the functional form of the stratification plays a crucial role . if the stratification length scale is larger than a critical value ( more precisely if @xmath173 ) the phase speed approaches @xmath172 asymptotically as @xmath174 , always remaining outside the range of @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the only unstable wavenumbers are the kelvin - helmholtz modes that have zero phase velocity and appear only for a finite range of the global richardson number .",
    "if the stratification length scale is smaller than this critical value ( more precisely if @xmath175 ) , the phase speed of the waves reaches the value of the maximum wind speed for a finite value of the wavenumber @xmath176 .",
    "as we increase the wavenumber further , the modes become unstable with the real part of the phase velocity smaller than one .",
    "the instability persists up to another critical value of the wavenumber @xmath177 .",
    "the mode with this wavenumber exhibits a singular behavior at the critical height . for wavenumbers smaller than @xmath169 a continuum of singular neutral modes exist .",
    "the findings in this work suggest several possibilities for further investigation .",
    "an important aspect that needs to be investigated is the effect of viscosity and diffusivity .",
    "as the work in @xcite has shown , the presence of finite viscosity and diffusivity decreases the growth rate and this effect is expected to be stronger for the higher harmonics .",
    "this may limit attempts to detect the higher harmonic modes via numerical and experimental studies .",
    "therefore , an investigation of the viscosity effects is further needed to find the critical reynolds number for which the higher modes become unstable and this should be the next step in the study of the higher harmonics instability .",
    "nonetheless , we note that in most astrophysical and geophysical flows , where holmboe s instability is of great importance , the reynolds and peclet numbers are large enough that the inviscid flow examined here is a good approximation , and depending on the stratification the higher harmonic modes might dominate .    finally , besides viscosity and dissipation , three dimensional effects , nonlinear evolution and saturation , as well as physical interpretation of these results through simplified layer models are all important issues that we plan to investigate in our future work .",
