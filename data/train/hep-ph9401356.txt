    "it is well known that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of interactions of quarks and gluons , provides a basic description of strong interactions in the standard model . for high energy scattering processes",
    ", the cross section can be factorized into a @xmath6 piece , the parton cross section which can be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd , and a @xmath7 piece which depends on the parton distribution functions inside the nucleon . in the qcd",
    "quark parton model , at the leading order , the structure functions in the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering are ` charge ' squared weighted combinations of the quark distribution functions @xmath8 , which denotes the probability finding a quark with flavor @xmath9 , momentum fraction @xmath4 and helicity @xmath10 within the nucleon .",
    "these distribution functions are essentially determined by the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "since these functions play an important role in standard model phenomenology and in understanding the nucleon structure , many recent experiments have been done to measure deep inelastic unpolarized structure functions and extract the parton distribution functions .",
    "( see @xcite for the review of deep inelastic structure functions , @xcite for a comprehensive compilation of the latest deep inelastic data and @xcite for the comparisons of data from different measurements . )    among the unpolarized data , recent deep inelastic scattering data provide some new information of the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "in particular , from the recent nmc measurement @xcite of difference @xmath11 the gottfried sum rule @xcite is found to be significantly less than the quark - parton model prediction of 1/3 .",
    "this implies that down - sea is larger than up - sea . combining with a smaller strange - sea from neutrino scattering @xcite",
    ", it seems likely that the unpolarized sea is not only su(3 ) flavor asymmetric , but also su(2 ) flavor asymmetric ( i.e. down - sea and up - sea are not equal ) .",
    "however , an su(2 ) flavor symmetric sea is usually assumed .    for the polarized structure functions ,",
    "many experiments @xcite have been performed in the past two decades , the review of earlier works can be found in @xcite .",
    "the recent measurement from emc at cern shows @xcite that the first moment of @xmath12 is significantly below the value expected from the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the emc data combined with the bjorken sum rule @xcite and the hyperon beta - decay data indicates that only a small fraction of the proton s spin is carried by the spin angular momentum of the quarks , which seems to contradict the naive expectations from the low energy constituent quark models .",
    "these conclusions are confirmed by two most recent experimental results reported by smc @xcite and e142 @xcite within large errors . at first glance",
    "the e142 data seems to disagree with the bjorken sum rule , but a detail analysis given by ellis and karliner @xcite shows that the discrepancy between the conclusions drawn by the smc and e142 data can be eliminated if the @xmath2-variation and higher twist effects are taken into account .",
    "there are a variety of theoretical activities attempting to resolve the quantitative decomposition and the origin of the spin of the nucleon .",
    "an incomplete list of recent works and review on this topic see @xcite and @xcite , and references there in . in principle , one should be able to calculate the parton distribution functions from the basic equations of qcd which determine the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "it needs to know the basic constituents inside the nucleon and qcd ( perturbative and nonperturbative ) interactions among these constituents , hence the structure of the nucleon in qcd is remarkably complex .",
    "the lattice qcd @xcite has provided a framework of evaluating the hadron structure ( masses , quark antiquark potential and other low energy observables ) in the nonperturbative way .",
    "there have been several preliminary results @xcite of the quark spin fraction of the nucleon spin have been reported . in @xcite ,",
    "the quark loop ( or ` sea ' quark ) contributions are calculated .",
    "even so , the evaluation of the structure functions and parton distribution functions is still not accessible in lattice approach and has to resort to various qcd inspired nucleon models .",
    "the first pioneering work of using mit bag model to calculate deep inelastic ( unpolarized ) structure functions was made by jaffe @xcite , then the polarized structure functions were calculated in the same model by many authors ( hughes @xcite , bell @xcite and celenza and shakin @xcite ) and recently by jaffe and ji @xcite . since the momentum is not conserved in the intermediate state in the mit bag model the structure function does not vanish for @xmath13 .",
    "an attempt to remove this difficulty by restoring the four momentum conservation and including the effects of spectator quarks was given in the cm ( center - of - mass ) bag model @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the model is that instead of the single quark current in the mit bag model a covariant effective electromagnetic current of the nucleon was suggested .",
    "the current includes not only the piece of the struck quark but also the pieces of the spectator quarks .",
    "the current satisfies translational invariance so four - momentum is conserved . another approach to avoid the support problem in the mit bag model was suggested by benesh and miller @xcite . the peierls - yoccoz projection @xcite has been used to obtain an eigenstate of zero momentum . including pion corrections the valence structure functions of the nucleon and @xmath14 are calculated .",
    "another disadvantage of the original mit bag model is that the spin - dependent force effect , which has been used to successfully explain the hadron spectroscopy @xcite , was neglected , hence @xmath15=2/3 is a constant in disagreement with data .",
    "many models @xcite have been suggested to incorporate the spin - dependent effects in describing the inelastic structure functions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nucleon is considered as a composite system of a quark and a pointlike diquark .",
    "the model treat kinematics relativistically and considers the spin - flavor dependence in the nucleon wave function . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of one - gluon exchange , yielding the @xmath16 mass difference , is incorporated and significantly modifies the result given in the su(6)-symmetric model . in @xcite ,",
    "the structure functions are calculated by using two phenomenological nucleon models @xmath17 non - topological soliton ( nts ) model and color - dielectric ( cd ) model . for nts model ,",
    "the authors conclude that an agreement between @xmath18 and the emc data could be obtained even the proton wave function is su(6)-symmetric . as the authors of @xcite pointed out , however ,",
    "that the model they considered can not reproduce the large body of low energy data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nucleon , which consists of three confining quarks , is treated approximately as an infinite free fermi gas system at finite temperature . in @xcite ,",
    "the constituent quark model @xcite of the nucleon are used . in both @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "only unpolarized structure functions are calculated .",
    "most of these model results are fairly close and can compared with the data in spite of different assumptions used in different models . it should be noted that a common features of all these calculations is that the structure functions are evaluated at some very low momentum transfer scale @xmath19 ( e.g @xmath20 gev@xmath1 for ref .",

    "@xcite , is that ` in order to obtain the correct momentum sum rule , it is necessary to go to extreme value of strong coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the use of qcd perturbation theory at the leading order can not be justified ' .",
    "we will show , however , that one may avoid this ambiguity and still obtain a reasonable description of deep inelastic structure functions from the low energy nucleon model .",
    "recently , we suggested a modified cm bag model ( mcm ) @xcite , which based on the cm bag model in @xcite , to calculate both elastic form factors and deep inelastic structure functions . in @xcite , the symmetry breaking effects coming from perturbative one - gluon exchange mechanism ( color hyperfine interactions ) and/or nonperturbative instanton spin interactions",
    "are simulated by introducing a symmetry breaking parameter .",
    "it has been shown that by including spin force effects , the model gives a fairly good description for the magnetic moments of octet baryon and the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "we also shown briefly in @xcite that the same model can fairly describe many aspects of deep inelastic structure functions of the nucleon . in this paper , we present detail results of these calculations .",
