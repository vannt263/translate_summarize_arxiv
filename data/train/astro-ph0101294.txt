    "suggests a solar - type origin , with surface magnetic loops confining hot , x - ray - emitting material within nearly static circumstellar coronae . for hotter , early - type stars ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity has no discernible dependence on rotation , but instead scales nearly linearly with bolometric luminosity , @xmath8 @xcite , suggesting a different emission mechanism , perhaps related to the high - density , radiatively driven stellar wind observed from such stars .",
    "nonetheless , an ongoing question has remained whether such hot - star x - ray emission originates from coronal - like processes occuring in nearly static regions near the stellar surface @xcite , or rather in the highly supersonic wind outflow , perhaps from shocks arising from intrinsic instabilities in the radiative driving mechanism @xcite .",
    "based on the observed strong winds in hot stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a key discriminant has been the apparent general lack of soft x - ray absorption , which , along with optical and uv spectral constraints , implies limits to the extent , temperature , and fractional contribution of the total x - ray output from a base corona @xcite .",
    "this limited inferred absorption is thus generally seen as evidence for emission arising from lower - density regions at large radii , in general agreement with a wind - shock model .    in the context of extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy , @xcite presented models of emission line profiles , from both a coronal source and from an expanding shell , affected by transfer through a stellar wind .",
    "these authors demonstrated that emission line profiles are a key discriminant of the source location .",
    "however , due to the small throughput and modest resolution of the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( ) spectrometers , combined with the extreme opacity of the interstellar medium in this bandpass , emission lines from only one hot star ( @xmath9 cma ) were observed with .",
    "the only high signal - to - noise line seen in this euv spectrum was the ly@xmath10 line , which was observed to be broadened by several hundred km s@xmath11 , lending credence to models that postulate a wind - origin for the hot plasma in ob stars @xcite .",
    "it is only recently , however , that orbiting x - ray observatories like and have been able to provide the first detections of spectrally resolved x - ray emission lines from hot , luminous stars @xcite . through the broadened profiles of these resolved x - ray emission lines , these data provide a new , key diagnostic for inferring whether the x - ray emission originates from a nearly static corona , or from an expanding stellar wind outflow .",
    "a key goal of the present paper is to provide a firm basis for interpreting such x - ray emission line spectra .",
    "specifically , we describe below the method (  2 ) and results (  3 ) for computations of synthetic line profiles arising from parameterized forms of x - ray emission in an expanding stellar wind . in comparison to recent work by @xcite , who derived analytic forms for x - ray emission profiles for the case of constant expansion velocity ,",
    "our analysis takes into account a variation of velocity @xmath12 in radius @xmath13 , as parameterized by the so - called ` beta - law ' form @xmath0 , where @xmath14 is the stellar radius and @xmath4 is the wind terminal speed . as in @xcite , the overall level of attenuation",
    "is characterized by an integral optical depth @xmath3 , and the x - ray emission filling factor is assumed to decline outward as a power law in radius , @xmath2 .",
    "however , we also allow for this emission to begin at a specified onset radius @xmath1 that can be set at or above the surface radius @xmath14 .",
    "we first present scaled emission profiles for various combinations of the four parameters @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath15 (  3.1 ) . for selected cases intended to represent roughly the competing models of a `` base coronal '' emission vs. instability - generated `` wind - shock '' emission ,",
    "we next compute synthetic profiles that are broadened by the estimated instrumental resolution for emission lines observed by and (  3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss (  4 ) how various features of the synthetic profiles are influenced by properties of the emitting material , and outline prospects for future work in interpreting hot - star x - ray spectra .",
    "extended monitoring observations by x - ray missions like @xcite have shown that for most early - type stars the x - ray emission is remarkably constant , with little or no evidence of rotational modulation , and with overall variations at or below the 1% level .",
    "this suggests that the hot , x - ray emitting material must be well - distributed within the circumstellar volume , whether in a narrow , near - surface corona , or as numerous ( @xmath16 ) , small elements of shock - heated gas embedded in the much cooler , uv - line - driven , ambient stellar wind .",

    "some notable general properties and trends are as follows :    * the profiles seem most sensitive to @xmath3 and @xmath1 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 having a comparatively modest influence . *",
    "the emission peaks are always blueward of line center ( i.e. , at @xmath65 ) , with increasing blueshift for increasing @xmath3 and/or increasing @xmath1 . *",

    "the profiles presented above represent the expected intrinsic line emission , with the only broadening associated with the directed , large - scale wind outflow . in practice , observed line profiles can be further broadened , both by the limited spectral resolution of the detector , as well as by doppler shifting from additional , random motions of the emitting gas .",
    "as already noted in  2.2 , for small - scale thermal or `` micro - turbulent '' motions , the associated broadening can be expected to be no larger than the gas sound speed , which for @xmath50  k plasma is order a few 100  km  @xmath51 .",
    "since this is much less than the @xmath80  km  @xmath51 characteristic of the directed wind outflow , it should have comparitatively minor effect on line - profiles arising from the outer wind . for the inner wind or a more static  coronal \" models , larger - scale turbulent broadening , which might in principle have a larger characeristic speed , can still be accounted for _ a postori _ , together with _",
    "instrumental broadening _ arising from the limited spectral resolution of the detectors used in the and satellites . for simplicity",

    "* ) vs.  wind - shock \" scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the coronal scenario envisions x - ray emission as coming mostly from a relatively narrow , nearly static layer near the stellar surface ; we represent this here with the parameter values @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the wind - shock scenario generally envisions x - ray production arising from instability - generated shocks that form in the acceleration region @xmath85 of the star s line - driven wind , with eventual slow decay of the shocks in the outer wind ; we represent this here with the parameter values @xmath86 , @xmath42 , and @xmath87 .",
    "for both scenarios we again consider the effect of various optical depth parameters , @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] compares results for the coronal ( left ) vs. wind - shock ( right ) scenario . in characterizing results",
    ", we shall refer to profiles with small vs. large @xmath7 as representing good / high vs. coarse / low resolution . here",
    "some notable general properties and trends include :    * at the best resolution ( @xmath88 ) , the coronal models are , as expected , notably narrower than the wind models . *",
    "the wind - shock models are generally more blue - shifted than the coronal models .",
    "* at the coarsest resolution , ( @xmath89 ) , all profiles have similar width , but still generally differ in overall blue - shift .",
    "* for the optically thin case , the emission is nearly symmetric about line center .",
    "for other cases , the emission peaks become more blue - shifted with increasing optical depth @xmath3 .",
    "( the coronal models with larger @xmath3 may not be relevant , however , since wind absorption would greatly reduce the overall strength of any observable emission . )",
    "the typical spectral resolution for is around @xmath90 .",
    "for characteristic wind terminal speed of @xmath91 , this implies a typical broadening parameter of @xmath92 .",
    "for , the spectral broadening is comparable , though slightly larger . clearly , at such high resolutions , it should be possible to place strong constraints on the site of x - ray emission and the degree of wind attenuation , as well as on the characteristic speeds of directed vs. turbulent motions of the emitting plasma .",
    "the parameterized emission models here provide a good basis for interpreting x - ray line - profile observations made possible by the new generation of orbiting x - ray telescopes .",
    "while detailed , quantitative analyses must await the general availability of specific datasets , it is already clear from the few hot - star x - ray spectra published thus far that there are some noteworthy challenges for modeling the associated x - ray emission .",
    "for example , temperature - sensitive line - ratio diagnostics provide constraints on the magnitude of shocks in dynamical models .",
    "generally instability generated wind - shock models tend to be dominated by moderate shock - strengths @xmath93  km  @xmath51 that can only heat material up to a maximum of @xmath94  k @xcite . in those stars with much higher inferred temperatures , for example @xmath95 ori c with @xmath96 k @xcite , there is a need to produce stronger shocks .",
    "one possibilty is for wind outflow to be channeled by magnetic loops @xcite . in this case ,",
    "wind material accelerated up opposite footpoints of a closed loop can be forced to collide near the loop top , in principle yielding shocks with velocity jumps of order @xmath97  km  @xmath51 , a substantial fraction of the wind terminal speed .",
    "another key diagnostic stems from the forbidden - to - intercombination ( f / i ) ratios of helium - like emission lines , which can provide a strong constraint on the location of the x - ray emission . in the case of the solar corona ,",
    "such ratios are nominally interpreted as density diagnostics @xcite .",
    "but because the strong uv radiation of hot - stars can generally dominate over electron collisions in the destruction of forbidden line upper levels , in such stars the f / i provides instead a constraint on the strength of the uv intensity @xcite . with appropriate atmospheric modeling of the relevant part of uv continuum",
    ", any inferred dilution of the radiation thus provides a diagnostic of the proximity of the x - ray emission to the stellar surface . for observations of @xmath98  pup @xcite , initial interpretations suggest formation well away from the stellar surface ( @xmath99 ) , consistent with a wind - shock origin , with moreover a general trend toward larger radii for lower - energy lines , as would be expected from the larger optical depths and thus larger unit - optical - depth radii for such lines . for chandra observations of @xmath98  ori @xcite ,",
    "the inferred formation radii are also generally away from the star ( @xmath100 ) , but with one stage ( ) suggesting a formation very close to the surface ( @xmath101 ) . however , in this latter case , the relevant uv flux for destruction of the forbidden upper levels lies at energies above the lyman - edge , and so any error in atmospheric modeling of the lyman jump could still alter this inferred formation radius .",
    "chandra observations of @xmath98  pup @xcite show similar results , with most inferred formation radii in the range @xmath102 , with trends again consistent with inferred unit - optical - depth radii , but again with one stage ( in this case ) implying formation quite close to the surface ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "of course , such fir constraints on source location must eventually be considered in conjunction with additional constraints , such as those provided by analysis of line profiles .",
    "indeed , in the context of this paper , the most notable new diagnostic provided by recent x - ray observations lies in the form of the line profiles .",
    "for some initial results , these have some quite puzzling characteristics .",
    "for example , in the spectrum of @xmath98 pup @xcite , the lines all exhibit a similar , significant broadening , but with half - widths @xmath104  km s@xmath11 that are still somewhat lower than the inferred wind terminal speed @xmath105  km s@xmath11 .",
    "the typical profiles have a rounded , gaussian form that is quite distinct from , e.g. , the flat - topped profiles expected for optically thin emission from a nearly constant velocity expansion . moreover , the profiles show only modest asymmetry , with the peak intensity only slightly blue - shifted , by @xmath106  km s@xmath11 relative to line - center , and the red - wing only slightly flatter and more extended than the blue - wing .",
    "recent somewhat higher spectral resolution observations by chandra do show the greater shift and asymmetry expected from optically thick wind emission for @xmath98 pup @xcite .",
    "but in chandra observations of the o9.7 ib star @xmath98 ori , the profiles are again very broad ( half - widths of @xmath107  1000  km  @xmath51 ) , but nearly symmetric @xcite .",
    "such profiles with substantial broadening , but little asymmetry and blueshift are difficult to reconcile with a simple wind - outflow model that includes attenuation by the wind and stellar core , both of which should preferentially attenuate x - rays from the back - side hemisphere , and thus in a wind or a corona with some outflow , preferentially reduce the _ red_-side emission .",
    "in fact , from detailed modeling constrained by observations , @xcite have argued that that the wind of should be optically thick to 1 kev x - rays at 10 , with the radius of optical depth unity being even greater for softer x - rays ( 20 at 0.6 kev ; and still 2 at 2 kev ) .    even for a base corona with some overall outflow velocity and _ no _ overlying wind attenuation , occultation by the stellar core should still produce line profiles that are skewed toward the blue . a coronal model with little or no net outflow",
    "could explain the observed profile symmetry , but matching the observed line - widths would then require the coronal material to have extremely large `` turbulent '' motions .",
    "for example , line widths in the chandra observations of @xmath98  ori @xcite require velocity dispersions of order 1000  km  @xmath51 , and some of the lines observed by in @xmath95 ori c @xcite are even broader than this , yet apparently still nearly symmetric . if the lack of red - wing attenuation is interpreted to mean that red - shifted emission does not arise from wind outflow from the backside hemisphere , then this suggest that material _ in front of the star _ must be flowing _",
    "downward _ at velocities of 1000  km  @xmath51 .",
    "since this is greater than the surface escape speed , it can not be the result of gravitational infall , but instead would imply that some mechanism , e.g. , perhaps magnetic reconnection @xcite , must actively accelerate roughly equally strong upflow and downflow with speeds of 1000  km  @xmath51 ! moreover , such random motions should inevitably lead to high - speed gas collisions and their associated shock heating . for shocks with velocity jumps of order 1000  km  @xmath51",
    "the associated post - shock temperature should be of order @xmath108  k , implying generally harder x - rays and higher ionization stages than are typically observed . in this context",
    ", these broad but symmetric profiles would indeed seem to represent a strong challenge for theoretical models .",
    "on the other hand , our synthesized line profiles from _ wind _ models do seem capable of producing relatively broad , yet symmetric and unshifted profiles , but only in the nearly complete absence of wind attenuation , and with emission originating far from the occultation of the stellar core . to test the viabilty of this alternative ,",
    "observed line - profiles should be interpreted in conjunction with other diagnostics , like the f / i ratio , that can constrain the radii of x - ray emission , and with an accurate account of wind absorption , as computed through opacity calculations for the observationally inferred wind mass loss rate .    any wind shock model with significant wind attenuation",
    "is expected to be strongly blueshifted and quite asymmetric ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "of all the line profiles discussed in the first group of and papers , the observations of @xmath98  pup provide the best evidence for the blue - shifts and asymmetry expected for optically thick wind emission @xcite . for example , figure 3 of cassinelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) shows 5 out of 6 lines with blueward shifts and asymmetry similar to profiles calculated here for wind - shock models with substantial optical depth , e.g. @xmath109 .",
    "at least for this canonical o - type star , these profiles seems to provide strong evidence of a wind origin for most of the observed x - rays .    in summary ,",
    "systematic fitting of the line - profiles will be necessary to place more quantitative constraints on the spatial distribution of hot plasma and the degree of wind attenuation in the observed o stars ; but some initial qualitative inferences are already possible .",
    "for some cases , the implied minimal wind attenuation combined with some significant bulk motion are puzzling , both in the context of coronal x - ray emission and in the context of the strong radiation - driven winds that are known to exist on these stars from uv , optical , ir , and radio observations .",
    "one possible solution to the wind attenuation problem might be found in clumping .",
    "a `` porous '' wind might allow many of the x - rays to stream through unattenuated , yet also lead to significant uv absorption if the interclump wind medium still has sufficient column density to produce optically thick uv lines .",
    "( the uv line transition probabilities are significantly larger than the bound - free x - ray cross sections . )",
    "an alternative is that the mass - loss rates of o stars may have been overestimated .",
    "it does not seem likely , however , that the winds are dense and smooth but transparent to x - rays , as that would require levels of ionization in the wind that would not allow for efficient radiation - driving . and",
    ", if the winds are indeed optically thin , then to discriminate between coronal and wind models will require a careful analysis of the shifts and asymmetries observed in the x - ray line profiles .    finally ,",
    "although we developed our analysis with hot stars in mind , it could be extended to other x - ray sources in which lines are emitted within a nearly symmetric expanding medium that may also have substantial continuum opacity .",
    "this could include nova winds , planetary nebulae , active galactic nuclei , and x - ray binaries .",
    "we thank r. ignace for providing a preprint of his paper on analytic x - ray profiles and also for his detailed comments on this manuscript .",
    "we also thank k. gayley and a. ud - doula for helpful comments on our analysis , and j. cassinelli and j. macfarlane for many useful insights regarding the x - ray spectra of o stars .",
