    "many wireless applications are limited by different forms of delay constraints .",
    "these applications range from the most basic voice communication to the more demanding multimedia streaming .",
    "however , due to its broadcast nature , the wireless channel is vulnerable to eavesdropping and other security threats .",
    "therefore , techniques that satisfy _ both _ the delay limitation and the confidentiality requirement are of definite interest .",
    "this motivates our analysis of the fundamental ( information theoretic ) limits of secure communication over fading channels subject to strict deadlines .",
    "recent works on information theoretic security have been largely inspired by the wire - tap channel model of wyner  @xcite . in this seminal work ,",
    "wyner established the achievability of non - zero secrecy capacity when the wiretapper channel is a degraded version of the main one , by exploiting the noise to create an advantage for the legitimate receiver .",
    "more recently , the effect of fading on the secrecy capacity was studied in  @xcite in the ergodic setting .",
    "the main insight offered by this work is the achievability of a non - zero secrecy capacity , by _ opportunistically _ exploiting the multi - path channel fluctuations , even when the eavesdropper channel is better than the legitimate one * on the average*.    on the other side , delay limited transmission over fading channels has been well studied in different network settings and using various traffic models .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the delay limited capacity notion was introduced and the optimal power control policies were characterized in several interesting scenarios . in  @xcite , the strict delay limitation of  @xcite was relaxed by allowing for buffering the packets at the transmitter . in this setup ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the power - delay trade - off curve was characterized yielding valuable insights on the structure of the optimal resource allocation strategies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the scheduling problem of data transmission over a finite delay horizon assuming perfect csi was considered  in  @xcite .",
    "our work can be viewed as a generalization of  @xcite whereby a secrecy constraint is imposed on the problem .    the delay limited transmission of secure data over fading channels was considered previously in  @xcite . in that work , the authors attempted to send the secure information using binning techniques inspired by the wiretap channel results .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it fails to secure the information in the particular instants where the eavesdropper channel gain is larger than that of the main channel .",
    "this results in the so - called * secrecy outage * phenomenon ( as defined in @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the delay limited setting , the secrecy outage can not be made to vanish by increasing the transmission power , since it does not offer a relative advantage to the legitimate receiver , leading to the conclusion that the delay limited secure rate achieved by this approach is equal to zero for most channel distributions of interest  @xcite .",
    "this obstacle is overcome by our two - stage approach . here",
    ", the delay sensitive data is secured via vernam s one time pad approach  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) using a private key , which was shared * secretly * by the two legitimate nodes during previous transmissions . since the key packets are * not delay sensitive * , the two nodes can share the key by distributing its bits over many fading realizations to capitalize on the ergodic behavior of the channel .",
    "our result is enabled by observing that , through the appropriate rate allocation , the key bits can be * superimposed * on the delay sensitive data packets so that they can be used for securing future packets .",
    "this mechanism is referred as _",
    "key renewal _ process in the sequel .",
    "this process requires an initialization phase to share the key needed for securing the first data packets .",
    "however , the loss in throughput entailed by the initialization overhead vanishes in the asymptotic limit of a large number of data packets .",
    "our analytical results establish the asymptotic optimality , with high snr , of this novel approach in the scenario where both the main and eavesdropper channel gains are known _ a - priori _ at the transmitter .",
    "when only the main channel csi is available , this approach is shown to achieve * a non - zero constant * secure rate for a wide class of _ quasi - static and invertible channels _",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii introduces the system model and notations used throughout the paper .",
    "section  iii focuses on the full csi scenario whereas the case with only the main channel csi is analyzed in section  iv ; along with some representative numerical results .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are offered in section  v.",
    "the system model is shown in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "a source node ( alice ) wishes to communicate with a destination node ( bob ) over a fading channel in the presence of an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "we adopt a block fading model , in which the channel is assumed to be constant during a coherence interval and changes randomly from an interval to the next according to a bounded continuous distribution .",
    "also , the coherence intervals are assumed to be large enough to allow for the use of random coding arguments . during any symbol interval @xmath0 , the signals received at the destination and the eavesdropper , respectively ,",

    "the source wishes to send a message @xmath13 to the destination while satisfying the delay and secrecy constraints . in the following ,",
    "our delay constraint is imposed by breaking our message into packets of equal sizes , where each one is encoded independently , transmitted in only one coherence block , and decoded by the main receiver at the end of this block .",
    "the total transmission time of @xmath14 channel symbol durations is divided into coherence intervals of length @xmath15 channel uses ; for which both @xmath16 and @xmath17 remain fixed .",

    "the average error probability of an @xmath24 code is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the total received signals at the legitimate receiver at the end of the block @xmath21 .",
    "we define the equivocation rate @xmath35 at the eavesdropper as the entropy rate of the transmitted message over block @xmath21 conditioned on the available csi and all the channel outputs at the eavesdropper , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the channel power gains of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper in @xmath14 symbol intervals , respectively .",
    "we consider only the perfect secrecy ( in the sense of  @xcite ) which requires the equivocation rate @xmath35 to be arbitrarily close to the message rate .",
