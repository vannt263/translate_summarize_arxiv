    "it is recognized that radio pulsars have peculiar space velocities between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , significantly greater than those of their progenitor stars .",
    "the highest speed ever recorded is from the guitar nebula pulsar ( cordes et al .",
    "1993 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ) , while the lowest has been recently measured for b2016 + 28 by brisken et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from very accurate vlba pulsar parallaxes .",
    "statistical studies , aimed at inferring the peculiar velocity at birth from the observed speed , give mean three - dimensional velocities of 100  500 @xmath3 for the isolated pulsars ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ; lorimer , bailes , & harrison 1997 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ; arzoumanian , chernoff , & cordes 2002 ) .",
    "an early explanation for the large space velocities called for _ recoil _ in a close binary that becomes unbound at the time of ( symmetric ) supernova explosion ( blaauw 1961 ; iben & tutukov 1996 ) .",
    "now , a number of observations hint at a _ natal _ origin of these high space velocities , or at a combination of orbital disruption ( when the progenitor lives in a binary ) and internal kick reaction",
    ". evidence for a kick at the time of neutron star birth is now found in a variety of systems : in runaway o / b associations ( leonard & dewey 1992 ) , in highly eccentric be / ns binaries ( van den heuvel & rappaport 1986 ; portgies - zwart & verbunt 1996 ) , in the binary pulsar j0045 - 7319 ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ; to explain its current spin - orbit configuration ) , and in double neutron star binaries such as b1913 + 16 ( bailes 1988 ; weisberg , romani , & taylor 1989 ; cordes , wasserman , & blaskiewicz 1990 ; kramer 1998 ; wex , kalogera & kramer 2000 ) where misalignment between the spin and orbital angular momentum axes indicates velocity asymmetry in the last supernova .",
    "all these observations support the view that the formation of neutron stars is accompanied by anisotropic explosion .",
    "this notion is bolstered by evolutionary studies of binary populations ( dewey & cordes 1987 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ; fryer , burrows , & benz 1998 ) and by studies ( e.g. cordes & wasserman 1984 ) on the survival of binary systems into their late evolutionary stages after supernova explosion .    among the physical processes that have been proposed to account for the kicks are large - scale density asymmetries seeded in the pre - supernova core ( leading to anisotropic shock propagation ) , asymmetric neutrino emission in presence of ultra - strong magnetic fields ( see lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 for a review ) , or off - centered electromagnetic dipole emission from the young pulsar ( harrison & tademaru 1975 ) .",
    "however , none of these mechanisms can explain kicks as large as @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the idea first put forward by imshennik & popov ( 1998 ) that , in the collapse of a rotating core , one or more self - gravitating lumps of neutronized matter may form in close orbit around the central nascent neutron star , transfer mass in the short lived binary , and ultimately explode , causing the remaining , massive neutron star to acquire a substantial kick velocity , as high as the highest observed .",
    "the light member explodes as mass transfer drives it below the minimum stable mass for a neutron stars . in the light star",
    ", stability is lost upon decompression by the @xmath5decaying neutrons and nuclear fissions by radio - active neutron - rich nuclei ( colpi , shapiro & teukolsky 1989 , 1991 ; blinnikov et al .",
    "1990 ) , that deposit energy driving matter into rapid expansion ( colpi , shapiro & teukolsky 1993 ; sumiyoshi et al .",
    "the kick tries its origin from the orbital motion of this evanescent super - close binary , that forms in the collapse of a rapidly rotating ( isolated ) iron core .",
    "we will study several effects that may modify the magnitude of the kick , such as gravitational bending of the exploding debris , rotational averaging of the momentum impulse , orbit decay , and delayed neutron star cooling .",
    "formation of a proto - neutron star companion around the main neutron star has never been verified in numerical simulations due to computational limitations .",
    "for this reason we elaborate on a study of bonnell ( 1994 ) on the formation of binary / multiple systems in collapsing gas cloud cores and its extension to the stellar core collapse in the aftermath of a supernova explosion ( bonnell & pringle 1995 ) to motivate our working hypothesis .",
    "the formation of such exotic binaries has been conjectured to occur in many works ( ruffini & wheeler 1971 ; clark & eardley 1977 ; blinnikov , novikov , perevodchikova , & polnarev 1984 ; nakamura & fukugita 1989 ; stella & treves 1987 ) .",
    "formation of a light companion around a main body implies breaking of spherical and axial symmetry during collapse and following core bounce . during dynamical collapse , unstable bar modes ( @xmath6 ) can grow in a fluid ( even non rotating ) that may end with fragmentation .",
    "however this is known to occur only if the cloud core contracts almost isothermally , as in the case of star s formation from unstable cold gas clouds ( bonnell 1994 ) .",
    "core collapse in type ii supernovae is far from isothermal ( it is described by a effective polytropic index @xmath7 ) so that instabilities of this type do not have time to grow ( lai 2000 ) , and simulations of non - axisymmetric rotating core collapse confirm this trend ( rampp , muller & ruffer 1998 ; centrella , new , lowe , & brown , 2001 ) . can fragmentation / fission be excited after core bounce ?    rapid rotation in equilibrium bodies is known to excite non - axisymmetric dynamical instabilities and these instabilities may grow in the proto - neutron star core . interestingly , core collapse simulations of unstable rotating iron cores ( heger , langer & woosley 2000 ; fryer & heger 2000 ) or polytropes ( zwerger & muller 1997 ) indicate that proto - neutron stars , soon after formation , can rotate differentially above the dynamical stability limit set when the rotational to gravitational potential energy ratio @xmath8 is larger than the value @xmath9 ( saijo et al . 2001 ) .",
    "strong non - linear growth of the dominant bar - like deformation ( @xmath6 ) is seen in these cores ( described as polytropes by rampp , muller , & ruffert 1998 ) .",
    "however there is no sign of fission into separate condensations .",
    "the bar evolves , producing two spiral arms that transport the core s excess angular momentum outwards ( see also shibata , baumgarte & shapiro 2000 ) .",
    "this reduces the bar s angular momentum such that a single central body is formed .",
    "how can a body develop local condensations when bar - unstable ?    according to bonnell s picture , the evolution of the bar instability is more complex , in reality .",
    "if the rapidly spinning proto - neutron star core goes bar unstable when surrounded by a fall - back disk , then matter present in the bar - driven spiral arms interacts with this material .",
    "the sweeping of a spiral arm into fall - back gas can gather sufficient matter to condense into a fragment of neutronized matter .",
    "this occurs because the @xmath10 mode grows during the development of the @xmath6 mode .",
    "the @xmath10 mode causes the displacement of the unpinned ( free - to - move ) core and creates an off - center spiral arm that sweeps up more material on one side than the other during `` continuing '' accretion .",
    "the condensation eventually collapses into a low mass neutron star .",
    "detailed simulations confirming or dismissing the occurrence of such instability are still lacking , so further considerations of the lump masses , temperatures and entropy contents are necessarily speculative .      here",
    "we wish to explore the possibility that a light ( proto-)neutron star forms around the main central body , lives for a while , and later explodes , imprinting a kick to the neutron star that remains ( due to linear momentum conservation ) before gravitational waves or hydrodynamical effects can drive it toward the central star .",
    "can a light ( proto)-neutron star form from the condensation of material accumulated in the off - centered spiral arm ?",
    "what limits can be imposed on its mass ?",
    "cooling plays a key role in addressing these questions .",
    "goussard , haensel & zdunik ( 1998 ) , strobel , schaab & weigel ( 1999 ) , and strobel & weigel ( 2001 ) have shown that the value of the minimum stable mass @xmath11 for a neutron star ( located at the turning point in the mass - radius relation of equilibria ) is a function of the temperature : it varies from @xmath12 at 50 - 100 milliseconds after core bounce ( setting the actual value of the mass of the central neutron star ) , to @xmath13 after @xmath14 second , down to @xmath15 after 30 seconds , reaching the value of @xmath16 ( baym , pethick & sutherland 1971 ) known for cold catalyzed matter ( @xmath17 mev ) several hundred seconds later .",
    "thus , the lump of nuclear matter gathered in the spiral arm by the instability may become self - bound if its mass @xmath18 is above the minimum corresponding to that particular temperature .",
    "once formed it is stabilized against expansion by cooling .",
    "the actual value of @xmath18 is thus determined by the overall dynamics of collapse after core bounce and varies between 0.0925 and @xmath19 it depends on the time at which the instability sets in , on the amount of fall - back material ( potential reservoir of matter in the lump ) and on the cooling history .    the value of @xmath18 and of the mass ratio @xmath20 in the binary ( with @xmath21 the heavier of the two stars ) remains unpredictable to us at this level , so we may just depict three possible scenarios for the formation and evolution of this evanescent binary : case ( a ) when the instability sets after few hundreds of milliseconds or a second after core bounce and binary formation occurs so that @xmath22 ( implying a pre - existing iron core of large mass if the primary is as massive as 1.4@xmath23 ) ; case ( b ) when a lighter star forms around a main body with @xmath24 after several tens of seconds from core bounce ; case ( c ) when cooling is sufficiently advanced that the minimum mass approaches its asymptotic value and the binary can have @xmath25 .",
    "the magnitude of a natal kick in ( a ) is difficult to estimate and we must await for realistic simulations of core collapse .",
    "values of @xmath26 above a given threshold in a binary are known to lead to unstable mass transfer and thus to final coalescence .",
    "we note that the evolution in this case might be similar to that described in coalescing neutron star binaries with slightly unequal masses ( see rosswog et al .",
    "2000 ) where it has been shown that large kicks can be acquired as a consequence of mass loss via a wind . case ( b ) and ( c ) will be explored in this paper .",
    "imshennik & popov ( 1998 ) estimated neutron star recoil speeds of order @xmath27 for scenario ( c ) .    in cases",
    "( b ) and ( c ) , one factor that could lower the final neutron star speed is the finite velocity of the ejecta .",
    "colpi , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1993 ) have shown that in the dynamical phase of the explosion the ejecta can attain speeds varying from 10,000 to @xmath28 ( the upper bound being related to the value of the binding energy of the star at the minimum mass relative to a dispersed state of iron ) .",
    "these speeds are close to the escape velocity from the binary and therefore the final kick imparted to the remaining neutron star may be influenced substantially by gravitational deflection of the ejecta , and velocity phase averaging during the explosion .",
    "a further threat would be a rapid decay of the orbital separation due to unstable mass transfer that may lead to final coalescence , and emission of gravitational waves .",
    "in @xmath29 we will describe the gravitational bending of the ejecta , while in @xmath30 we will study initial conditions and , subsequently , orbit decay and mass exchange , for cases ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we will then give an estimate of the kick speed including phase - velocity averaging .",
    "consider now the instant at which the light secondary of mass @xmath18 explodes , having reached the dynamical instability point ( @xmath31 ) , while orbiting the heavier , primary neutron star of mass @xmath21 .    obtaining the final kick speed imparted to the heavy neutron star is complicated by several factors .",
    "first , some of the material ejected from the exploding star can remain bound to the system and eventually accretes onto the remaining star .",
    "second , material that escapes may not be moving at extremely large speeds , even right at ejection , and therefore emerges with a different momentum than it has at the point of explosion .",
    "third , the mass of ejected material may be of order 10% of the total mass of the system , and self gravity could play a role .",
    "fourth , the ejecta are a fluid , and , depending on how much time elapses between neutron star formation and the explosion of the low mass star , move through ambient gas left over from the original supernova explosion . if the ejecta are slowed significantly by the surrounding gas , some material that would be judged unbound upon ejection might actually end up falling back toward the neutron star , possibly to accrete onto it .",
    "suppose that relative to the remaining heavy neutron star , the orbital velocity of the exploding star is @xmath32 at the instant of explosion ( @xmath33 ) , and the position of the center of mass of the exploding star is at @xmath34 let us write the final velocity of the remaining neutron star as _",
    "kick = - , [ pkick ] where @xmath35 .",
    "if the ejecta are expelled isotropically relative to @xmath36 , and at speeds large compared with @xmath37 , then we expect @xmath38 , in which case the remaining neutron star recoils with the maximum possible kick speed v_kick , max [ vkick ] as implied by momentum conservation in the center of mass of the binary .    to get a more realistic , but still approximate , idea of the size of @xmath39 , we work to zeroth order in the ejected mass , and also treat the trajectories of the ejecta ballistically ; this is equivalent to ignoring the third and fourth complications listed above entirely . by working to zeroth order in the mass of the ejecta",
    ", we can also assume that all particles are ejected virtually from a single point , @xmath36 .",
    "let the velocity of a particle relative to the exploding star be @xmath40 , and assume that @xmath40 is distributed isotropically about the position of the exploding star with probability @xmath41 .",
    "since we work to zeroth order in the mass of the ejecta , we may take the heavy neutron star to remain at fixed position in the calculation .",
    "the problem that remains is the orbital mechanics for each particle relative to the massive star .",
    "the orbits are characterized by the conserved quantities e&=&12+^2-gmr + & = & ( + ) + & = & -gmr+(+ ) , [ conserved ] which are the orbital energy and angular momentum per unit mass , and the runge - lenz vector , respectively .",
    "we note that a==gme= ; @xmath42 for bound orbits , @xmath43 for unbound orbits .    to calculate @xmath44",
    ", we need to find the momentum per unit mass carried away by the ejecta that escape to infinite distance .",
    "first , we need to identify the initial velocities of particles that escape . for these",
    ", we must have @xmath45 , and from equation ( [ conserved ] ) we find the condition = vw > gmr-(v^2+w^2)2 [ escapecond ] where @xmath35 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "second , we need to find the mapping between initial and final velocity . to this aim , it is useful to define a coordinate system in which @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the orbit is then confined to the @xmath52 plane , and we can read off the final velocity in this system from equation ( 15.12 ) in landau and lifshitz , _ mechanics _ : _ = [ -+(2e / gm ) ] [ vfinal ] .",
    "we wish to express the final velocity @xmath53 in a coordinate system fixed in the binary at the point of explosion .",
    "we thus choose , explicitly = rand = vso that the orbital angular momentum of the light star relative to @xmath21 just prior to explosion points along @xmath54 .",
    "we have explicitly selected the point of explosion to occur at either peri- or apocenter of the orbit , and for simplicity , we specialize to circular orbits below .",

    "[ e ] the velocity of the ejecta can thus be expressed in terms of the known explosion parameters ( @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) by combining equation ( 6 ) with equations ( 7)-(10 ) .",
    "the result is that the total momentum carried off per unit mass of ejecta is = _ e()>0d^3p ( ) _ ( ) , so that @xmath57 to zeroth order in @xmath58 as @xmath59 is isotropic we can separate out the integrals = , and consider different distributions of ejection speeds separately .",
    "the integration only extends over unbound orbits . for @xmath60 , all ejecta escape , and for @xmath61 , no ejecta can escape .    because of reflection symmetry with respect to the binary orbital plane , @xmath62 vanishes identically .",
    "the kick is thus given in the orbital plane of the pre - explosion binary .",
    "it is easy to show that when the particles are ejected with equal velocity @xmath63 so that @xmath64 the integrals yield @xmath65 and @xmath66 for very large values of @xmath63 ( @xmath67 ) which is consistent with the requirement that at large ejection speeds , the outflow reaches infinity with an average velocity comparable to that of the exploding star .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath44 as a function of the dimensionless explosion velocity @xmath68 notice that there is no kick ( i.e. , @xmath44 vanishes ) when @xmath69 ( see eq . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "this occurs at a critical value of the expansion speed @xmath70 which is @xmath71 for @xmath72 to zeroth order in @xmath58 when @xmath73 , the mass outflow vanishes identically and the ejecta fall back to the remaining neutron star transferring all their linear momentum to it .",
    "the final kick speed imparted to the remaining neutron star depends crucially on the evolutionary scenario leading to the formation and disruption of its low mass companion .",
    "the range of possible values of @xmath74 the initial mass of the secondary ( hereon ) , depends on the time the fragment forms and how fast its cools .",
    "both of these complications distinguish the problem of `` early '' formation and decay of an evanescent proto - neutron star binary ( case b ) from the problem of `` late '' decay of a neutron star binary ( case c ) originally discussed by clark & eardley ( 1977 ) , blinnikov et al .",

    "very high kicks come from such complex hydrodynamical process that alternative models have not been able to produce .",
    "in this paper , we have elaborated on suggestions that substantial neutron star recoil can result from the explosion of a low mass neutron star formed in the aftermath of rotating core collapse ( imshennik & popov 1998 ) .",
    "a noteworthy feature of this process is that the final kick speed is determined by nuclear physics .",
    "the details about the formation mechanism and hydro - dynamical effects produce in reality a widespread range in velocities , as the one we see .",
    "we have extended earlier work by estimating the effect of the finite speed of the material ejected in the explosion , including both gravitational deflection , phase averaging , and indirectly taking into account cooling effects .",
    "we argue that a range of neutron star recoil speeds could arise from disruption scenarios with different companion masses .",
    "the recoil speed resulting from the dissolution of an evanescent binary system can be around 1000 @xmath3 , explaining the larger values deduced observationally .",
    "it is remarkable that nuclear physics implies a value in the observational range at all , once such a binary system is presumed to form , a concordance that lends some support to the idea .",
    "the kicks that result from this mechanism are confined to the orbital plane of the evanescent neutron star binary .",
    "we expect the spin angular momentum vector of the remnant neutron star to be nearly , if not perfectly , aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary , and in turn aligned with the angular momentum vector of the collapsing iron core . near alignment would be consistent with the requirements imposed by the observation of geodetic precession of b1913 + 16 , where the kick is constrained to lie very nearly in the plane of progenitor binary , which was most likely perpendicular to the spins of the spun - up neutron star ( i.e. b1913 + 16 ) and its pre - explosion companion star ( wex , kalogera , & kramer 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , though , x - ray observations of the vela pulsar have revealed a jet parallel to its proper motion ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ; helfand , gotthelf , & halpern 2001 ) , and it has been argued that the proper motions of both vela and the crab pulsar are closely aligned with their spin axes ( lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) . the kick mechanism studied here would not be able to account for parallel spin and velocity .",
    "however , we note that the proper motions of both vela and the crab correspond to transverse speeds of @xmath198 and @xmath199 respectively , using reasonable estimates of the distances to the pulsars ( lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) . for",
    "the alignment to be real , the space velocities of these two systems must lie in the plane of the sky .",
    "the inferred speeds of these two pulsars are then considerably smaller than the characteristic speed arising from explosion of a low mass , tidally disrupted companion .",
    "we propose that the formation of vela and the crab did not produce an evanescent binary , and therefore some other mechanism was responsible for their spin - aligned kicks ( such as those explored by lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) .",
    "we suggest that the larger kick component is due to formation and disruption of an evanescent binary , and is perpendicular to the spin axis , and that the smaller kick component is associated with other less vigorous kicks that tend to align with the rotation axis , perhaps because of phase averaging ( e.g. spruit & phinney 1998 ; lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) .",
    "a superposition of these two classes of kicks would also be consistent with the requirement of _ nearly _ but not _ precisely _ spin - perpendicular kicks to account for the observation of geodetic precession in b1913 + 16 ( wex , kalogera , & kramer 2000 ) .",
    "if this idea is correct , then one expects that lower velocity neutron stars should have their space velocities predominantly along their spin axes , and high velocity neutron stars should have space velocities predominantly perpendicular to their spins , giving origin to two independent ( low and high velocity ) distributions .",
    "a contamination of low velocity stars ( belonging to the low velocity tail of the high velocity distribution ) would come from those explosions in the evanescent binary where light bending and rotational averaging have been more important .",
    "this could give rise to a _",
    "bimodal _ distribution of velocities as is inferred from the observations ( arzoumanian , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) .",
    "this scenario predicts a clear signature in the neutrino emission , in the aftermath of core collapse : two neutrino bursts occurring several seconds or minutes after core bounce , i.e. , after the main neutrino burst , should signal ( i ) kelvin contraction of the condensation gathered by the instability and ( ii ) explosion ( on the dynamical time ) of the light neutron star .",
    "neutrino emission between the two bursts should also come form material that accretes onto the neutron star that remains .",
    "heavy @xmath200process elements , debris of the explosion of the light star , should also be ejected and found deep in the supernova expanding shells .",
    "finally , we note that the same phenomenon could occur if the formation of a light neutron star accompanies rotating core collapse to a black hole . in that case",
    ", we find that the recoil velocity of the black hole will be proportional to @xmath201 , which is not the simple @xmath202 scaling one would expect for a kick mechanism that ejects the same amount of momentum irrespective of whether a supernova leaves behind a neutron star or a black hole . the higher kick implied by this scaling",
    "could be compensated by stronger relativistic effects of gravitational bending and unstable mass transfer that can lead to a much lower escape probability of the exploding debris .",
