    "knowledge of one illuminates the other .",
    "nowhere is their symbiosis clearer , or more critical to physical understanding , than in mesoscopic conduction .",
    "carrier fluctuations , measured as noise , change dramatically in the physical setting of ballistic transport @xcite .",
    "noise yields insights into the innermost aspects of carrier motion that can not be gained from conductance alone .",
    "noise at _ high currents _ is the most revealing .",
    "little is known about high - field mesoscopic noise , despite the ease with which even modest driving potentials can push a mesoscopic system beyond linear response @xcite .",
    "it is acknowledged that this unfamiliar but important region must be opened up and mapped @xcite .",
    "we preface our study with a brief recollection of ballistic transport .",
    "so - called mesoscopic conductors have sizes comparable to the scale for electron scattering . such systems no longer exhibit bulk ohmic behavior .",
    "this was strikingly demonstrated in the recent experiments of de picciotto _ et al .",
    "the resistance of a ballistic , almost one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire was probed , noninvasively , at two inner contacts well separated from the large diffusive leads acting as current source and drain . across the inner probes and at finite current , the wire s voltage drop , and hence the intrinsic resistance , were deduced to be essentially zero .",
    "reference also reported two - probe current - voltage data that included the source and drain in series with the 1d channel . in their",
    "well characterized 1d wire they found good agreement with the standard landauer - bttiker ( lb ) prediction of quantized jumps in the two - terminal conductance , as a function of carrier density @xcite .    at this point",
    "we come upon the core issue in ballistic transport . how can the finite conductance ( albeit with sharp steps ) be reconciled with the property of totally resistance - free transport within the central ballistic segment ?",
    "the lb theory accounts for this coexistence by simple kinematics .",
    "a 1d wire admits a sparse set of discrete subband states for electron transmission , while its attached leads have a much richer quasicontinuous density of such states .",
    "as well , they are collisionally coupled to a rich phonon spectrum .",
    "bottlenecks arise as carriers try to funnel into and fan out of the small set of 1d states . that mismatch destroys perfect conduction and manifests as the `` contact resistance '' of the leads .    according to the lb account",
    ", the contact resistance is quantized because its bottleneck is regulated _",
    "solely _ by the occupancy of the quantized ballistic states .",
    "each time the electrons fermi level accesses an additional higher 1d subband , the ideal two - probe conductance is shown to jump by @xmath0 @xcite .    in the landauer - bttiker picture",
    ", therefore , the two - probe conductance appears to be _",
    "free _ of any influence from extraneous parameters such as the asymptotic density of states and scattering rates for the macroscopic leads ; those can enter only implicitly in the transport @xcite .",
    "one must suppose that the physics of relaxation in the carrier reservoirs remains concealed  in a nonspecific fashion  within each lead s equilibrium state as it fixes the boundary conditions for the sample @xcite .",
    "we make an important observation . if a 1d wire is imperfectly transmissive ( finite resistance ) , lb predicts departures from the ideal staircase for two - probe conductance . on the other hand , if one knows for sure that the 1d wire transmits _ perfectly _ ( zero resistance ) lb is bound to say , unequivocally , that the two - probe conductance must scale strictly universally .",
    "the published two - probe results of ref .",
    "record a somewhat imperfect `` universal '' conductance , yet the four - probe results record perfect transmission .",
    "we will return to this apparent dilemma .    here",
    "noise enters as a wholly different kind of probe . beside the linear lb theory for conductance , there is a corresponding theory for low - field mesoscopic fluctuations ( in the strictly linear regime , these should always be be tightly circumscribed by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) .",
    "the most authoritative survey of lb noise theory to date is blanter and bttiker s @xcite .",
    "inherently nonlinear mesoscopic noise is out of reach to the lb approach , which can treat only voltages much below the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "we now pose our key question : what can those little - known fluctuations reveal about the wire - lead interaction and the contact resistance ?",
    "we predict the surprising existence of large peaks in the thermal , or hot - electron , noise of a ballistic system .",
    "these noise structures are _ much larger than shot noise _ which also peaks at the stepwise two - probe conductance transitions . for high - field thermal noise ,",
    "more can be said .",
    "its maxima carry unique quantitative information tracking the interplay of inelastic and elastic scattering in the leads .",
    "nonlinear fluctuations , governed by inelasticity , are simply inaccessible to elastic - only , low - field descriptions . for our part , we build upon existing nonequilibrium kinetics @xcite .    in the following section we describe our kinetic model for the conductance of a 1d ballistic wire fully open to an incoherent dissipative environment . in sec",
    "4 we extend the kinetic description to the nonequilibrium current noise in the system , and demonstrate the rich behavior of its spectral density .",
    "section 5 has our numerical results , confirming that hot ballistic electrons , in their transition from a classical to a degenerate regime , yield dramatic thermal - fluctuation peaks . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we sum up ; our predictions for nonequilibrium ballistic noise have direct implications for corroborating the recent seminal four - probe data @xcite .",
    "figure 1 depicts our model system .",
    "an ideal 1d wire of length @xmath1 is connected to two large reservoirs which are always at equilibrium ; the identical arrangement of landauer - bttiker , as for ref . .",
    "elastic ( nondissipative ) and inelastic ( dissipative ) collisions occur within the leads",
    ". a kinetic description will cover both _ wire and leads_. inelastic and elastic mean free paths ( mfps ) can not be shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that it is utterly essential to incorporate , within the microscopic equations of motion , at least the leading - order effects of dissipative inelastic collisions in the leads .",
    "it is the kinetics of dissipative relaxation _ alone _ that secures the energetic stability of transport over the system @xcite , by establishing steady state .",
    "there is a second crucial consequence of inelastic relaxation in the leads : the total loss of phase memory for carriers crossing the ballistic region of the system . from the ballistic carriers perspective , they no longer bear the detailed signature of their collision history , which thus becomes markovian .",
    "the only kinetic parameters that survive phase breaking are ( a ) the effective scale of the scattering mean free paths ( matching the ballistic length ) , and ( b ) the size of the driving field that impels carriers across the collision - free segment . it is precisely through phase breaking that the ballistic system becomes insensitive to the particulars of geometry and material structure of its asymptotic leads . on that basis",
    ", one can make a semi - classical analysis of the ballistic kinetics .",
    "our fermi - liquid perspective is very closely related to that of kamenev and kohn @xcite .",
    "we generalize their coherent , closed - circuit , linear - response approach to deal with a phase - broken , open system driven far from equilibrium .",
    "we guarantee the open system s all - important _ gauge invariance _ by inserting an explicit flux @xmath2 of electrons at the source , and its matched sink @xmath3 at the drain ( equivalently , a hole flux of strength @xmath2 ) .",
    "formally , the direct inclusion of boundary flux sources is strictly mandated by global  as distinct from local  charge and current conservation in open conductors , with nontrivial electromotive forces ( emfs ) acting from outside @xcite .",
    "physically , the flux - source regions at the lead  wire boundaries fulfill a unique , and absolutely necessary , dynamical role .",
    "they are the active sites for the nonequilibrium scattering processes that directly determine the relaxation in the leads .",
    "first we recover the full landauer - bttiker conductance by our kinetic analysis .",
    "consider any single , occupied 1d subband . from the viewpoint of their time - stationary distribution , incoherence in the leads",
    "means that carriers inside the finite wire will perceive a homogeneous physical environment , not only within the wire proper ( internal homogeneity is also assumed in the lb description ) but at a far longer range .",
    "they will behave as though the physical wire were embedded , seamlessly , in a very long effective 1d host .",
    "this effective host conductor , `` standing in '' for the leads , is itself nonideal _ on a scale to match the ballistic length _",
    "@xmath1 .",
    "the boundaries and field sources are as if at infinity , even though the actual current injector and extractor can be adjacent to the wire . explicit carrier relaxation in the boundary neighborhoods , in concert with the emf ( landauer s resistivity dipole ) , asymptotically `` prepares '' the nonequilibrium _ and uniform _ steady state of the carriers crossing the inner ballistic region .",
    "the size @xmath4 of the emf quantifies the injected carriers _ self - consistent _ adjustment to relaxation inside the embedding host ( the leads ) .",

    "let the steady - state electron distribution in the wire be @xmath6 for states @xmath7 within our 1d subband ( spin label implied ) .",

    "fluctuations are all .",

    "in the light of ( iii ) above , the nonequilibrium behavior of eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) at a subband threshold is extremely interesting .",
    "an increase in electron density within each level @xmath51 takes its ballistic carrier population out of the classical domain ( @xmath68 ) and makes it cross over to the highly degenerate regime ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "evidently , classical statistics naturally dominates whenever @xmath72 .",
    "if one insists on suppressing it by imposing a strict but inappropriate degeneracy there , the development of @xmath62 will echo that for the landauer - bttiker conductance model : @xmath73 .",

    ", we see dramatic peaks where @xmath93 has characteristic steps .",
    "the peaks reveal an orderly metamorphosis of 1d hot - electron fluctuations , from their classical ( @xmath67-independent ) regime at the steps to their degeneracy - suppressed ( @xmath67-scaled ) state at the plateaux .",
    "this striking , chameleon - like transformation bears no relation to shot noise @xcite .",
    "such an effect can be readily probed in the laboratory , by appropriately biasing a gate voltage that couples to the electron density in the ballistic channel @xcite .",

    "it is instructive to continue the study of @xmath92 down to low emfs , comparing it with the well known landauer - bttiker `` noise crossover '' formula , which combines all excess thermal noise into a single entity with shot noise @xcite :    @xmath94}. \\label{e12}\\ ] ]    the quantitative contrast between @xmath62 and the total lb noise is made clear in fig . 3 for the identical two - band situation of fig . 2 , but now at @xmath95 . even in this low - field regime",
    "we find that @xmath62 , computed strictly within an orthodox and fully gauge - invariant kinetic approach , still dominates the result of the widely held crossover model .",
    "we end by recalling the apparent impasse raised by the de picciotto _",
    "et al_. data @xcite , vis  vis the lb theory s categorical and uncompromising prediction of perfect , universal conductance steps @xcite .",

    "this implies total neutralization of landauer s resistivity dipole within the wire body ; @xmath98 .",
    "its canceling counter - fields must be from dipoles sitting hard by the boundaries .",
    "that makes them highly localized .",
    "the notion of strong additional localized counter - charges , over and above the natural hartree displacement @xcite that sets up the resistivity dipole in the first place , is energetically unlikely .",
    "landauer s self - consistent dipole is the fundamental element of mesoscopic transport @xcite .",
    "further substructures , at screening scales shorter than natural , would invite a logical _ reductio ad absurdum_.    now suppose instead that the probes couple capacitively to the 1d wire . at most , they will record variations of carrier density between their locations .",
    "but the wire is uniform , so there is no variation .",
    "capacitive probes will report no difference .",
    "thus there is no reason for the resistivity dipole to cancel out .    the conclusion of ref .",
    ", that their noninvasive probe arrangement gives genuine and direct access to internal voltages , may now be checked by quite different means .",
    "the nonequilibrium _ thermal _ ballistic noise ( totally separate from any considerations of the shot noise @xcite ) can provide independent experimental verification .    in brief : if the driving field @xmath99 throughout the ballistic structure is indeed zero , there will be little excess noise of the kind we predict . if , on the other hand , @xmath100 then thermal noise must appear  and in copious amounts  at the subband crossings .    here , the outcome is plain in terms of nonequilibrium noise .",
    "the experimental import of our work is much wider , however .",
    "it covers not just noise in a heterostructure - based device @xcite , but also fluctuations at the intense fields sustainable in metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "there , the quantum - confinement energies are huge by comparison with normal semiconductor - based 1d channels .",
