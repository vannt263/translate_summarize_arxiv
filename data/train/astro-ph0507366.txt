    "the extragalactic background of high energy neutrinos studied in this paper arises from collisions of high energy cosmic ray ( cr ) protons emitted by local sources ( e.g. , by active galactic nuclei ) in extragalactic space , with extragalactic background of infrared photons . all previous studies ( except the most recent ones @xcite ) took into account the interactions of cr protons with relic photons ( @xmath0 ) only .",
    "evidently , other components of the extragalactic radiation background also must be taken into account in calculation of the extragalactic background of high energy neutrinos .",
    "the interval of photon wavelengths which is potentially most important from this point of view is @xmath1 , i.e. , the infrared region . at last fifteen years infrared astronomy developed very intensively ( see ,",
    "e.g. , reviews @xcite ) , and now the rather well - grounded calculation of enb from interactions of cosmic rays with extragalactic infrared photons became possible @xcite .",
    "for the concrete calculation of infrared background we chose the paper of dwek _ et al _ @xcite , where the synthetic spectral energy distributions in the large diapason of values of the total luminosities were derived , and the simple double power - law form of the local luminosity function ( i.e. , the present - day number density ) of infrared galaxies suggested by soifer _ et al _ @xcite . as for the cr spectrum",
    ": we do not know well enough the extragalactic cosmic ray spectrum and , therefore , we are forced to use the crucial hypothesis about extragalactic origin of high energy cr s . everywhere in our calculations",
    "we use the extragalactic model ( the crossover energy @xmath2 ) and normalize our theoretical cr spectrum on experimental cr data .",
    "neutrino flux from interactions of high energy cosmic rays with infrared background was recently calculated by stanev @xcite .",
    "our work differs from that of @xcite in several respects .",
    "the main difference is that in @xcite there is no non - trivial cosmological evolution of infrared background : this evolution is assumed to be the same as of microwave background radiation .",
    "besides , in @xcite there is no separating of contributions to enb from infrared and optical diapasons of the background while we calculate enb from far - infrared part of the radiation background only .",
    "to obtain approximate expressions for the spectra and intensities of cr protons in extragalactic space we use the cosmological transport ( kinetic ) equation without integral term , i.e. , we work in the continuous energy loss approximation introduced , for these problems , by berezinsky and grigoreva @xcite .",
    "this equation is written as @xmath3 - \\frac{3n(e , z)}{1+z}=g(e , z).\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 is the number density of cr protons with a given redshift @xmath5 , the function @xmath6 is the change of proton energy in unit interval of @xmath5 , @xmath7 the first term in r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) takes into account adiabatic energy losses ( those due to the cosmological expansion ) .",
    "the function @xmath8 is the cooling rate of protons via @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions at the cosmological epoch with redshift @xmath5 . in our approximation ,",
    "the cooling rate consists from two parts , @xmath11 ( cooling due to interactions with relic and infrared components of the extragalactic radiation background ) .",
    "the function @xmath12 in r.h.s . of the kinetic equation describes the combined source of extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "this source function can be written in the form @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the number density of local cr sources ( e.g. , agns ) in the proper ( physical ) volume , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the activity of each local source ( the integrated number of produced particles per second ) , @xmath17 . writing this",
    ", we assume that the cosmological evolution of cosmic ray sources can be parametrized by power law with the sharp cut - off at some epoch with redshift @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath18 are considered as parameters of a model of the combined source ) . at last",
    ", the function @xmath20 in eq.([eq4 ] ) describes a form of the differential energy spectrum of the local source .",
    "for a calculation of the extragalactic radiation background it is convenient to use the cosmological transport equation which is analogous to that used in the previous section . the function which must be found",
    "is the number density of infrared photons at different cosmological epochs , @xmath21 .",
    "the expression for the source function of the kinetic equation is @xmath22 here , the function @xmath23 is the spectral luminosity ( `` spectral energy distribution '' ) of a luminous local source ( which is in this case an infrared - luminous galaxy with a given total infrared luminosity @xmath24 ) .",
    "the function @xmath25 in eq.([eq5 ] ) is the number density of infrared - luminous galaxies with a given luminosity @xmath24 in the proper ( physical ) volume , which is connected with the local luminosity function @xmath26 by the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters determining the cosmological evolution of the luminosity of the local source , and evolution of the comoving density of these sources , respectively .",
    "the resulting expression for@xmath30the number density of infrared photons in extragalactic space is ( neglecting energy losses of these photons during their travelling ) is @xmath31    the cooling rate of cr protons in infrared radiation background is expressed through @xmath32 by the formula @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) . here",
    ", @xmath35 is the photon energy in the cr proton rest system , @xmath36 is the photoabsorbtion cross section , @xmath37 is the relative proton energy loss in @xmath38-collision ( in the observer system ) .",
    "we used the following model for the cosmological evolution of infrared sources : @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the parameters are as follows : @xmath42 .",
    "* a ) * proton cooling rates in relic and infrared photon background . *",
    "b ) * extragalactic cr proton spectrum calculated with ( lower curve ) and without ( upper curve ) taking into account energy losses in infrared background .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    on fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show the proton cooling rate on infrared photon gas ( together with corresponding function for the relic photon case ) .",
    "one can see that at proton energy @xmath43 ev , the contribution of infrared photons in total cooling rate is noticeable .",
    "the results of two calculations of extragalactic cr proton spectrum ( with and without taking into account energy losses on infrared photons ) are shown on fig .",
    "the theoretical cr spectrum at @xmath44 was normalized on experimental data ; from such normalization we obtained the value of the product @xmath45 entering eq.([eq4 ] ) for the source function of the cr proton kinetic equation , @xmath46 . for the calculation of the cr spectrum we used the following set of parameters determining the spectrum slope and cosmological evolution of cr sources : @xmath47 .",
    "we assumed that extragalactic spectrum of crs dominates beginning from @xmath48ev .",
    "the choice of cosmological evolution parameters @xmath49 used in the calculation of infrared background and cr spectrum is justified by our prediction of the spectral intensity @xmath50 of infrared background measured experimentally ( fig . [ fig2]a ) .",
    "for simplicity we use in this work one - pion approximation , i.e. , we assume that in @xmath38-reaction only two particles ( neutron and pion ) are produced . in this case , as is well known the pions have approximately isotropic distribution in the center of mass system and , as a consequence , the step - like energy spectra in the observer system .",
    "the main photoproduction reaction , @xmath51 , and subsequent decays of @xmath52 and @xmath53 lead to production of @xmath54,@xmath55 , @xmath56 . in the present work we will be interested only in ( @xmath57)-flux .",
    "therefore , we add together the neutrino from pion and muon decays .",
    "neutron produced in the photoproduction process will decay giving proton , long before the next interaction with photons of the background .",
    "results of the neutrino spectra calculation are shown on fig .",
    "in spite of the fact that the density of infrared photons in extragalactic space is much smaller ( @xmath58 photons@xmath59@xmath60 ) than that of relic microwave photons , the neutrino background appears to be not so small , due to the lower threshold for photoproduction and , especially , due to much stronger time evolution of infrared background in comparison with that of relic photons .",
    "the predicted neutrino fluxes are comparable , more or less , with the neutrino fluxes from other extragalactic sources at energy region near @xmath61 ev ( @xmath62-ray bursts , topological defects , etc ) and deserve further theoretical and , in future , experimental studies .",
