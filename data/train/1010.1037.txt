    "social stratification refers to the classification of individuals into groups or classes based on shared socio - economic or power conditions within a society @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of stratified societies is that individuals tend to interact more strongly with others in their own group .",

    "recently , the effects of social stratification on the wealth distribution of a system of interacting economic agents have been studied @xcite . in this model , agents behave as particles in a gas and they can interact with each other at random , as in most models that have been proposed for economic exchange @xcite . however , many real social and economic systems can be described as complex networks , such as small - world networks and scale - free networks @xcite .",

    "a maximum of @xmath70 occurs around @xmath71 , when each agent can initially interact with his neighbors , and therefore a greater variation with respect to the initial uniform distribution of wealth occurs in the system . for larger values of @xmath17 ,",
    "all local interactions are allowed initially . in this regime ,",
    "a redistribution of wealth should occur as the probability @xmath29 of favoring the poorest agents is incremented .",

    "note that @xmath70 tends to an asymptotic , large value as @xmath73 , corresponding to a fully connected network , i. e. , any agent can interact with each other in the system , losing the notion of spatial location .",
    "this corresponds to the most commonly studied situations in models of economic exchange @xcite .",
    "increasing the spatial range of the interactions , represented by @xmath1 , implies both an increment in the clustering coefficient and a decrease in the characteristic path length of the network . to see which of these two topological properties of the network is more relevant for the variation of the gini coefficient observed in figure  [ fig5](a ) , we plot in figure  [ fig5](b ) @xmath70 as a function of the rewiring probability @xmath2 , for different values of the parameter @xmath29 . note that there is little change in the values of @xmath70 as @xmath2 increases , in comparison to the larger variation experienced by @xmath70 when @xmath1 is augmented in figure  [ fig5](a ) .",
    "the characteristic path length in the network decreases in both cases , but the clustering coefficient does not increases on the range of values of @xmath2 shown in figure  [ fig5](b ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the increment in the gini coefficient observed in figure  [ fig5](a ) can be mainly attributed to the increase in the clustering coefficient of the network when @xmath1 is varied .",
    "in other words , the size of the neighborhood is more relevant for the occurrence of an equitable distribution of wealth than the presence of long range connections in a system subject to a stratified economic exchange .",
    "the inclusion of a network or a spatial location for interacting economic agents allows the use of concepts from spatiotemporal dynamical systems in economic models .",
    "we have considered a model of stratified economic exchange defined on a network and have shown that different spatiotemporal patterns can occur as the parameters of the system are varied .",
    "we have characterized these patterns as laminar , intermittent and turbulent , employing analogies from spatiotemporal dynamical systems .",
    "we have characterized the transition from a laminar state to a turbulent state through the activity of the system , that measures the average wealth exchanged in the asymptotic regime of the system .",
    "this quantity depends mainly on the dynamical parameters @xmath17 and @xmath29 . similarly , the gini coefficient , that characterizes the inequality in the distribution of wealth , depends on the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath29 . for large values of @xmath17 ,",
    "increasing @xmath29 increases the activity but decreases the gini coefficient .",
    "thus , high levels of economic exchange activity are associated to low values of the gini coefficient , i.e. , to more equitable distributions of wealth in the system .",
    "the topology of the underlying network has little effect on the activity of the system @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , the gini coefficient @xmath70 increases when the range of the interactions , represented by @xmath1 , is increased .",
    "we have shown that the relevant topological property of the network that influences the behavior of @xmath70 , is the clustering coefficient , instead of the characteristic path length of the network .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows that a reduction of the gini coefficient in a system subject to a dynamics of stratified economic exchange may be achieved by reducing the size of the neighborhood of the interacting agents .",
    "our results add support to the view of local interactions as a relevant ingredient that can have important consequences in the collective behavior of economic models .",
