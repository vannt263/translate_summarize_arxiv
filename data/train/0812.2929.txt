    "searching for preserved remnants of physical processes that occurred in the cosmic past is one of cosmologists main tools in developing our understanding of how galaxies , groups , and clusters were formed and evolved , and ultimately came to define the large scale structure we observe .",
    "recent studies have shown that there seems to be a class of systems with exceptional preservation , known as fossil groups ( fgs , ponman et al .",
    "these systems consist of isolated , luminous early - type galaxies embedded in an extended x - ray halo .",
    "the main motivation for seeking such galactic systems stems from the fact that the merger time scales for @xmath9 group galaxies is much shorter than the cooling time scales for the hot gas component within which these bright galaxies are embedded ( e.g. barnes 1989 , ponman & bertram 1993 ) . in this simplistic view fgs",
    "are a natural consequence of the merging process in normal groups and therefore can be used to trace the history of coalescence in the not - so - high - redshift universe .    from the observational viewpoint ,",
    "fgs are seen in the optical as large elliptical galaxies , but with x - ray luminosities comparable to those of an entire group of galaxies ( @xmath10 ; see jones et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter jo03 ) .",
    "to date , no clear picture of their origin has emerged from the collected data .",
    "two main scenarios have been suggested : fgs result from the complete merging of galaxies that constituted a loose group in the past , collapsing at an early epoch , but never becoming incorporated into clusters ( hausman & ostriker 1978 ; ponman et al . 1994 ; jones et al .",
    "2000 ; khosroshahi , jones & ponman 2004 ) ; or they originate from a region that inhibits formation of @xmath11 galaxies in these groups leading to an atypical galaxy luminosity function ( lf , mulchaey & zabludoff 1999 ) .    these systems have been detected out to redshifts of at least @xmath12 ( ulmer et al .",

    "section 7 deals with the internal structure of seed galaxies of fgs , as measured by their structural parameters and internal color gradients . in section 8 , we analyze stellar population properties of fgs , by looking at the distributions of age , metallicity , and @xmath8 enhancement . finally ,",

    "fgs are defined as bound systems of galaxies associated with extended x - ray sources .",
    "the total optical luminosity of these systems is dominated by a bright elliptical galaxy , and their lf exhibits a gap between the first and second rank galaxies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the sample of fg candidates defined here is selected on the basis of spectroscopic and photometric data from the data release 4 ( dr4 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and on the basis of rass x - ray imaging .",

    "[ subsec : xray ] .",
    "the optical selection is performed on a complete volume - limited catalog of 91563 galaxies , retrieved from the sdss - dr4 database   through the casjobs facility  .",
    "the catalog consists of all galaxies with absolute @xmath19-band magnitudes @xmath20 brighter than @xmath21 and with spectroscopic redshifts between 0.05 and 0.095 .",
    "absolute magnitudes are obtained from the sdss @xmath19-band petrosian magnitudes , corrected for galactic extinction using the reddening maps of  @xcite .",
    "the lower redshift limit of the catalog is chosen to minimize the aperture bias  @xcite , which strongly affects large nearby galaxies , while the upper redshift limit guarantees a high level of completeness , estimated through schmidt s @xmath22 test ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude limit of @xmath21 corresponds approximately to the apparent magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopy at redshift @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "since fgs are systems characterized by a gap in the galaxy lf , we first select optical candidates by searching the sdss spectroscopic database for pairs of galaxies whose magnitude difference is larger than a given value ,  . for each galaxy in the catalog , we select all objects whose projected distance on the sky from the target galaxy is smaller than a maximum radius ,  , and whose redshift difference is smaller than a given value ,  . in other words , for each galaxy , we select companion galaxies in a cylinder centered on the galaxy , with a radius of   and a semi - height of   along the line of sight . the value of   is fixed in physical units ( mpc ) , and the selection is done by transforming the value of   to the apparent size that corresponds to the redshift of the seed galaxy .",

    "the parameters are chosen in such a way that the contamination rate is at most 15% , defined as the fraction of fg candidates that would be selected ( for a given set of values of  ,   and  ) from a random distribution of galaxies with the same mean galaxy surface density , magnitude , and redshift distributions as the sdss catalog .",
    "we generated randomized galaxy catalogs by applying the shuffling method , as described in  @xcite .",
    "first , we bin the sdss catalog in @xmath25 in right ascension and declination and @xmath26 in redshift . the randomized catalog is then obtained by shuffling galaxies in each bin by randomly exchanging their right ascension , declination and redshift .",
    "the above bin sizes are chosen such that both the mean surface density and the redshift distribution of galaxies in the sdss catalog are preserved , without overly reducing the number of galaxies in each bin .",

    "the shuffled catalogs reproduce well the sky coverage of the sdss - dr4 catalog as well as the corresponding distributions of galaxy magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "since the shuffling procedure washes out small scale structures from the galaxy catalog , the fg candidates that are selected from the shuffled catalogs only arise as rare and random instances in the magnitude , redshift , and spatial distributions of the galaxies , instead of a population of objects that follow from some physical evolutionary path . to reduce statistical fluctuations in the contamination rate estimates , we repeat the shuffling procedure 100 times and estimate the contamination rate as the ratio of the number of optical fg candidates to the mean number of candidates selected from the shuffled catalogs applying the same  ,  , and   criteria .    figs .

    "this prevents complete spectroscopic coverage of objects in dense regions , even in cases where multiple tiles overlap .",

    "we fit the sdss @xmath19-band image of each galaxy with a seeing convolved sersic model ( see app .  [",

    "thus , we rejected fg candidates within 1.5 mpc ( at the fg redshift ) from a rich abell cluster .",
    "we discarded @xmath59 abell clusters with the exception of abell  690 ( richness @xmath60 ; fg@xmath61 of tab .",

    "twenty - eight ( out of 102 ) fg candidates were discarded with this criterion , leaving a sample of seventy - four fg candidates .",
    "although we eliminated agn and spiral galaxies from the sample , we further investigated the presence of elusive emission lines in the sdss spectra of the 102 fgs with significant x - ray detections . for each spectrum , we modeled the absorption lines with a combination of stellar population models using the starlight code ( cid fernandes et al .",

    "moreover , almost all of the agn are classified as liners , which have a typical x - ray luminosity of @xmath68 ergs / s ( see  @xcite , two orders of magnitudes lower than the minimum x - ray luminosity of the fgs in our sample .",
    "thus , we conclude that agn and starburst contamination does not contribute significantly to the x - ray measurements , except for agn that might be detected only in x - rays . however , as noted by  @xcite , these account for only a minor fraction of all agn .      an important issue to consider",
    "is whether the observed x - ray luminosity comes from an extended source .",
    "although agn were excised from our sample following the recipes in  @xcite , some agn might only be detected in x - ray ( @xcite ) , representing a further source of contamination in the fg sample . to objectively establish the extended nature of the x - ray emission we proceed as follows :    1 - we select 1232 point sources from the rass bright source catalog ( @xcite ) , requiring that the sources have a high probability of being a real detection ( i.e. source detection likelihood @xmath69 ) and a source extension of zero .",
    "this data set was used to measure the mean fwhm of the rass psf over the whole sky .",

    "source detection was performed using s - extractor with a detection threshold of 2@xmath57 over an area of 5 pixels , using a tophat detection filter , which is optimal for faint source detection .",
    "the gaussian smoothing enhances the contrast over the background . for each fg",
    ", we identified the closest x - ray source to the sdss position .    3 - using the smoothed x - ray images",
    ", we fit a moffat distribution to the fg candidates . here , the error in the fwhm was estimated from one - hundred monte carlo simulations . for each simulation ,",
    "all the detected sources were masked from the original rass image and the remaining pixels were bootstrapped to create a random background image , which was then gaussian smoothed .",
    "the moffat model was added to this image , and the fitting was repeated .",
    "we subtracted in quadrature the mean fwhm of the rass smoothed psf from the fwhm of each source . this quantity was defined as the source extension , with its error computed from the uncertainty on the fwhm .",
    "4 - we matched x - ray and optical sources by considering only cases where the distance between the optical and x - ray fg positions were smaller than the fwhm of the x - ray source .",
    "only fourty - three ( out of seventy - four ) fg candidates have x - ray counterparts meeting this requirement .    5 - we classified the fg x - ray sources as extended if the extension parameter was greater than 0 at the 2@xmath57 level ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ext ] ) .",
    "this selection removes eight point - like fg candidates , leading to a sample of thirty - five extended fgs . in the following section , we discuss the effect of sdss spectroscopic incompleteness on this sample .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy is incomplete in high - density regions due to limitations on fiber placement .",
    "we address this spectroscopic incompleteness issue as follows : for each of the thirty - five fg candidates , we select all galaxies with sdss photometry fulfilling the criterion and with magnitude between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath74 is the fg @xmath19-band petrosian magnitude .",
    "these are the galaxies that could possibly invalidate the fossilness definition .",
    "then , we queried the sdss dr6 and ned for spectroscopic redshifts of these possible contaminants .",
