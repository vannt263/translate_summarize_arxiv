    "the original motivation for adding a large compact dimension was to generate a @xmath0 dimensional vector gauge fields from a purely gravitational action in higher dimensions ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "describing nature completely by this mechanism is not viable .",
    "not only is matter unexplainable in this approach , but the @xmath0 dimensional action inescapably contains a massless scalar particle that successfully competes with a spin-2 particle ( graviton ) to create a strong mix of scalar - tensor gravity unacceptable to modern experiment .",
    "one conceptual cousin of the original kaluza - klein idea is string theory , or m theory , where strings and @xmath6-branes populate the higher dimensional space rather than just a spin-2 graviton ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "a strong motivation for string theory is that it may be finite , and may thus provide a self - consistent description of quantum gravity .",
    "string theory also predicts troublesome scalar moduli particles that make it a challenge to identify the ground state of the theory .",
    "solutions to this problem have been postulated , and progress has been made on other aspects of the theory , giving hope that it may be possible in time to write down a string theory description of nature .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that there are more reasons to suggest extra dimensions than just having a self - consistent description of gravity  @xcite .",
    "the additional motivations include new directions to attack the hierarchy problem  @xcite and the cosmological constant problem  @xcite , unifying the gravitational coupling with the gauge couplings  @xcite , perturbative supersymmetry breaking in string theory  @xcite , and low - scale compactifications of string theory  @xcite .",
    "an important breakthrough was the realization that the gravitational scale could be as low as the weak scale and still be phenomenologically viable  @xcite .",
    "two or more large extra dimensions felt by gravity are required to make this possible .",
    "another tantalizing realization is that gauge couplings may unify with a greatly reduced string scale if gauge fields feel one or more large extra dimensions  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a tentative picture is filling in for a viable scenario with tev - scale extra dimensions , and especially tev - scale string theory with a vastly reduced planck scale , compactification scale , string scale , and unification scale .    in this article , we focus on the phenomenology of the gauge and matter sectors of theories with large extra dimensions",
    ". in particular , the kaluza - klein states of the gauge particles and matter particles can have important observable consequences at high - energy colliders .",
    "it is these consequences that we wish to study .",
    "we build on previous studies that assumed a similar framework and discussed relevant collider phenomenology  @xcite-@xcite .    in principle , gravitational radiation into extra dimensions and virtual graviton induced observables are correlated with observables generated by kk excitations of the gauge and matter fields .",
    "many detailed studies on gravitational effects at high - energy colliders  @xcite-@xcite and important astrophysical bounds  @xcite have appeared .",
    "however , to know the correlations between these effects and what we study here requires that we either specify the underlying theory , or assume that gravitational effects do not pollute the signals .",
    "we choose the latter path by assuming that gravity propagates in significantly more extra dimensions than the gauge and matter fields do .",
    "for example , gravity may propagate in ten dimensions , while gauge fields are confined to a @xmath7-brane ( gauge bosons ) or 3-brane ( fermions ) .",
    "( @xmath7 is defined to be the number of spatial dimensions that bulk gauge fields feel , and @xmath8 is defined to be the number of remaining spatial dimensions in which gravity propagates . )",
    "also , we assume that the higher - dimensional gravity scale and the gauge - unification scale are comparable , as is expected in string theory .",
    "these assumptions imply that gravitational radiation will not be as significant as gauge kk excitations in collider phenomenology .",
    "the exact strength of virtual graviton exchange effects is not calculable , and so it is difficult to tell how probing they are with respect to the gauge interactions pursued here .",
    "estimates based on naive dimensional analysis suggest that the virtual graviton exchange processes in some cases may be comparable in probing power of extra dimensions as kk excitations of gauge bosons given the above assumptions .    in the following sections we define a five - dimensional standard model ( 5dsm ) .",
    "particularly important is the definition of the higgs boson fields in this lagrangian , since electroweak symmetry breaking effects will correlate strongly with some observables .",
    "we then compactify the extra dimensions and work in an effective field theory that is the standard model plus additional non - renormalizable interactions arising from integrating out kk excitations .",
    "we then do a global fit to precision electroweak data and find limits on the gauge compacification scale .",
    "several comparisons of precision electroweak data to the sm with extra dimensions have been published recently  @xcite .",
    "our contributions in this direction are to construct a global fit to all relevant data , and to present results in terms of operator coefficients rather than just a fifth dimension compactification scale .",
    "one result from the global fit demonstrates that a light higgs boson is not necessary , in contrast to the standard model fit which requires it .",
    "we also study the possibility of finding the first excited state at hadron colliders , and derive sensitivities to the full kk tower at @xmath9 colliders . in the last section we conclude and summarize the results .",
    "we begin by considering only one extra spatial dimension beyond the usual @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "our first task is to state which standard model particles live in five spacetime dimensions and which live only in the four dimensions . in order to obtain massive chiral fermions",
    "we assume that the fermions live in the `` twisted sector '' of string theory , and so are naturally confined to `` walls '' of an orbifold fixed point in the higher dimensional space .",
    "the gauge fields are non - chiral and so may live with impunity in higher dimensions , that is the fifth dimension , or the `` bulk . ''",
    "these assumptions are essentially identical to those made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is somewhat more difficult to decide what to do with the higgs fields .",
    "they are non - chiral fields as well , and with no reference to a more fundamental theory it appears natural to put them in the bulk with the gauge fields .",
    "to answer this question more satisfactorily , it is necessary to discuss the role of supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the more fundamental theory is likely to contain space - time supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , one of the motivations for large extra dimensions is the ability to obtain tree - level supersymmetry breaking at @xmath10 from scherk - schwartz compactification of a tev string theory .",
    "the superpartners will then have masses near @xmath10 and will have little effect on current collider phenomenology as long as @xmath11 .    as a consequence of supersymmetry , two higgs doublets are necessary in the spectrum , @xmath12 which gives mass to up - type quarks , and @xmath13 which gives mass to down - type quarks and leptons .",
    "if one higgs boson is on the wall and the other higgs boson is in the bulk , then successful gauge coupling unification is possible with only the states of the mssm in the low - energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "unification is also possible by putting both higgs fields in the bulk along with extra particles that may be necessary for proton stability and other reasons  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it may not be necessary to require both higgs fields to be zero - mode excitations under orbifolding  @xcite .",
    "we therefore allow our higgs sector to contain higgs field(s ) in the bulk and higgs field(s ) on the wall  @xcite .",
    "we define , where @xmath14 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field on the wall , and @xmath15 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field in the bulk . in some theories @xmath16 can be identified with either @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and @xmath17 can be identified with the other higgs field of the mssm . in these cases ,",
    "@xmath18 or @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "however , the low - energy effective theory may more natural best be described in terms of a single higgs boson originating from non - chiral bulk field(s ) , in which case @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "furthermore , although supersymmetry may be necessary for a viable string scenario , the most economical model is the standard model with one higgs field either in the @xmath7-brane bulk or confined on the wall . therefore , the choices @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be of particular interest when we discuss the ew precision measurement predictions below .",
    "our starting framework is equivalent to ref .",
    "@xcite , where we assume the vector bosons and one higgs field ( @xmath25 ) live in the 5d bulk , and the fermions and another higgs field ( @xmath26 ) live on the 4d wall or boundary of the @xmath27 orbifold . in five dimensions , the kinetic terms of the lagrangian",
    "are simply l_5 = dy d^4x , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 gauge coupling in the covariant derivative , and @xmath25 is the higgs boson in the bulk , and @xmath26 is the higgs boson on the wall .",
    "the @xmath30 function indicates that the fermions and @xmath26 fields are localized at @xmath31 , the location of the 3-brane wall .",
    "compactifying the fifth dimension on a @xmath27 line segment , one finds [ 4d lagrangian ] l_4 & = & d^4x \\ { _ n=0^. + & + & .",

    ", one should replace @xmath33 with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the group generators , to obtain the appropriate expressions . from this lagrangian interactions in the theory",
    "are specified .",
    "the kk states have an additional @xmath36 strength in their interactions , which may appear odd at first sight .",
    "this factor arises from rescaling the gauge kinetic terms to be canonically normalized for all @xmath37 .",
    "also , the zero - mode scalars from @xmath38 are not present since @xmath38 fields are chosen to be odd under the @xmath39 orbifolding .",
    "many of the renormalized coupling parameters , such as the gauge couplings , of the 5dsm are directly analogous to the sm parameters .",
    "however , we emphasize that it is a _ different theory_. even though these gauge couplings `` look the same '' as the sm , they do not relate the same way to physical observables measured at high - energy colliders . for",
    "this reason it is more appropriate to ignore the standard model and construct predictions for observables from our 5dsm lagrangian and compare to experiment .",
    "these observables will depend on gauge couplings , the compactification scale @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "a precise description of the phenomenology requires a complete understanding of the underlying theory .",
    "this is especially true with two or more extra dimensions , since the coefficients of operators induced by kk excitations are divergent when trying to apply a naive effective field theory approach to integrating out these modes .",
    "more precisely , there is no theoretical problem with constructing an effective field theory description of low energies below the compactification scale , and utilizing it to calculate all observables .",
    "the difficulty is that there is no model independent way to match all the couplings with the full theory .",
    "the simplest approaches of compactifying field theories of higher dimensions to field theories of lower dimensions often do not yield sensible results for the effective theory .    specifically , in the effective theory there will be operators arising from integrating out all the higher modes .",
    "these operators will have coefficients that depend on ~_n .",
    "for one extra dimension , _",
    "n =  ( assuming  g_n = g ) which is convergent . for two or more extra dimensions the sum diverges",
    "however , a more accurate application of the fundamental theory indicates that @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 , and is in general given by  @xcite [ gn ] g_n ~g exp ( ) , where @xmath44 is the string scale .",
    "this behavior is in qualitative agreement with string scattering amplitudes at high energy which tend toward zero .",
    "the exponential suppression then cures the problem of divergent summations of kk states .",
    "however , the precise coefficients and form of eq .  [ gn ] is model dependent .",
    "also , there are many other model dependent considerations that will yield different couplings of kk gauge bosons to different fermions . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that this situation arises if fermions are stuck to different points of a thick wall . in this case , the kk phenomenology could be qualitatively different than what is presented here .    in an effort to be as model independent as possible ,",
    "we present all our `` indirect '' search results in terms of a parameter @xmath45 which is defined to be v2_n ( ) .",
    "it is this quantity that can account for variations of @xmath42 for different @xmath43 in the summation of the correct effective theory , and the regularization of the kk sum .",
    "often , for concreteness , we will translate a limit of @xmath45 that we find into a limit on @xmath46 by assuming one extra dimension and that @xmath47 for all @xmath43 .",
    "we must also keep in mind that other subtleties of the full theory may contribute to collider phenomenology in addition to what we have discussed here  @xcite .",
    "in the standard model , all physical observables can be predicted in terms of a small set of input observables .",
    "equivalently , the standard model contains several parameters in the lagrangian which can be fit to by comparing calculations within the model to measurements .",
    "there are more observables than there are parameters , and so the fit is over - constrained . a global @xmath48 analysis to precision electroweak data",
    "can determine if a particular model , such as the sm , is a consistent description of nature .",
    "in the following we do a global analysis of ew precision measurement data using the higher dimensional standard model ( hdsm ) . in the limit that the extra compactified dimensions radii tend to zero , we will recover the standard model global fit results .",
    "it has been often stated that the sm fits the ew precision data very well ; however , this is only true if we assume that the higgs boson is light . in",
    "the 5dsm there are two more parameters in the theory beyond the usual sm parameters that will impact precision measurement predictions  @xcite .",
    "these parameters are @xmath41 ( the ratio of wall - higgs vev to bulk - higgs vev ) and @xmath49 ( the compactification scale ) .",
    "we shall see below that strong correlations exist between allowed values of @xmath41 , @xmath46 , and @xmath50 once we require that the 5dsm be consistent with all measurements .",
    "* construct the full bare lagrangian of the theory , @xmath51 .",
    "* split the bare parameters and bare fields into renormalized quantities and counterterms , @xmath52 . *",
    "decide on a renormalization scheme ( ms - bar , on - shell , etc . ) that sets the values of the counterterms ( e.g. , set to a loop correction at a particular scale ) .",
    "for tree - level calculations , it is most convenient to set the counterterms to zero . *",
    "calculate all observables using the renormalized lagrangian . from the previous steps",

    "perform a constrained global fit to see if there is a set of renormalized couplings @xmath54 that allows @xmath55 to within experimental uncertainty .    in some cases",
    "a model can be completely ruled out by the above procedure , whereas in other cases like the sm and the 5dsm , the model can work for a limited range of parameter choices for the as - yet unknown parameters .",
    "there are many observables that we wish to compare predictions with experiment .",
    "above , we specified the lagrangian and renormalized parameters that enable us to carry out this program . in this section",
    "we write down , analytically , the calculated observables at leading order in an expansion of @xmath56 .",
    "we expand in @xmath56 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath45 ) since we know that we recover the good sm fit to data as @xmath57 .",
    "the physical vector boson masses are to leading order in @xmath56 , m_w^2 & = & g^2 v^2 [ 1-s_^4 v ] , + m_z^2 & = & v^2 [ 1-s_^4 v/^2 ] , where we define [ veq ] v2_n=1^ = , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . the last equality in eq .",

    "all observables depend explicitly or implicitly on @xmath45 since renormalized parameters such as @xmath42 and @xmath70 are merely intermediate book - keeping devices in the pursuit of expressing observables in terms of other observables .",
    "the best - fit values from data of the renormalized parameters will depend , for example , on how much @xmath45 affects @xmath71 .",
    "there are also important loop corrections to these observables .",
    "we assume that the loop corrections involving kk excitations are higher order corrections compared to loop corrections from zero - mode particles ( `` sm states '' ) and tree - level kk interactions with the zero modes .",
    "furthermore , on the @xmath63-pole we ignore the tree - level contribution of exchanged @xmath72 and @xmath73 kk excitations to the total background ( off - resonant ) rate .",
    "this is justified since @xmath63-pole scattering does not interfere with off - shell background processes .",
    "although ordinary photon exchange subtraction is necessary when translating raw @xmath63-pole data into @xmath63 decay rates , the high kk mass assumption ( @xmath74 ) renders additional subtractions unnecessary .",

    "we assume that one physical higgs scalar boson is present in the spectrum which interacts with the fermions and gauge bosons like a sm higgs boson .",
    "the other physical higgs degrees of freedom either do not exist or have interactions decoupled from the zero modes of the gauge bosons and the fermions .",
    "this is analogous to the mssm , where one higgs boson acts like a sm higgs boson and the rest decouple , being irrelevant for precision measurement analyses .    our procedure ,",
    "then , is to choose a higgs boson mass and vary @xmath45 to see how the predictions change for the observables .",
    "we wish to minimize the @xmath48 function defined as , ^2_i .",
    "we also define @xmath80 .    in fig .",

    "the @xmath48 value for @xmath83 ( decoupled extra dimensions ) and @xmath84 is @xmath85 .",
    "we then allow @xmath45 to vary from zero and @xmath81 to vary , and define the allowed region of parameter space to be that which has @xmath86 . from fig .",
    "[ vlimit2 ] we can see that the light higgs boson is favored for @xmath83 , just as the well - known sm results indicate .",
    "furthermore , as we increase the higgs mass the best fit value of @xmath45 drifts more and more into the @xmath87 region . within the context of the 5dsm , negative values of @xmath45 are not physical . increasing the value of @xmath45 , or , equivalently in the 5dsm , lowering the compactification scale @xmath46",
    ", we see that the electroweak precision data fit only gets worse for any value of @xmath81 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath45 with @xmath86 is @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the limit on @xmath45 in this theory is @xmath89 which is equivalent to @xmath90 in the 5dsm .    for @xmath24 , meaning the only higgs boson(s ) associated with ewsb is on the wall , we find the opposite behavior . in fig .",
    "[ vlimit3 ] we plot the @xmath48 for various choices of @xmath81 , with @xmath24 and with @xmath45 varying . in this case , the fit remains good as @xmath45 increases and @xmath81 increases .",

    "[ vlimit2 ] . )",
    "a similar relaxing of the sm higgs boson mass limit from precision data has been demonstrated in other contexts  @xcite .",
    "now , all the minima of the @xmath48 fits are in the @xmath91 physical region . for @xmath92 , a non - zero value of @xmath45",
    "is required to be present in the theory in order to provide an acceptable fit to the data . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ vlimit3 ] , the higgs mass could be heavy and as high as @xmath1 and still have @xmath86 as long as @xmath93 .",
    "that is , kk excitations of gauge bosons must substantially affect precision electroweak predictions in order to obtain a good fit with @xmath92 .",
    "if the higgs mass gets above @xmath1 then there is no longer a choice of @xmath45 for which @xmath86 .",
    "limits on @xmath45 can also be obtained by finding its maximum value with @xmath86 .",
    "this value is @xmath94 which translates to @xmath95 in the 5dsm .",
    "the reason why large @xmath81 is compatible with precision data can be seen most clearly by inspecting the behavior of @xmath96 and @xmath64 in the limit of @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath91 the value of @xmath96 decreases and @xmath64 increases , precisely what lowering the higgs boson mass would do to the predictions . in this case ,",
    "the low - mass higgs boson is not needed if @xmath45 is sufficiently high .",
    "we next ask what the 95% c.l .",
    "range is for @xmath45 given a fixed @xmath81 .",
    "this question differs slightly from the previous question , in that we are no longer asking how good of a fit a particular value of @xmath81 is , but rather what deviations of @xmath45 would be tolerated if @xmath81 were given to us from another source ( direct experiment , `` by god '' , etc . ) . for this we must analyze the @xmath98 distribution , which is defined to be @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the lowest value of @xmath48 for a fixed @xmath81 but variable @xmath45 .",
    "then , the 95% range of @xmath45 is determined by requiring @xmath101 .",
    "the case where a negative @xmath45 provides the best fit must be handled by following the feldman - cousins prescription  @xcite . in table  1",
