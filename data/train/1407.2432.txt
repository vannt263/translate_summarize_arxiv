    "how species abundance varies in space and time is a major issue both for basic ( biogeography , macroecology ) and applied ( production of biodiversity state indicators ) ecology .",
    "professionals working on biodiversity thus spend considerable resources collecting data that are suitable for estimating this variation @xcite .",
    "most of the scientific literature recommends the implementation of both a statistically valid sampling design and a standardized protocol for collecting such data ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "many methods have been developed to estimate species abundance in a defined location , e.g. , using mark - recapture methods @xcite or distance sampling approaches @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches require an intense sampling effort and are not always practical .",
    "many authors have noted that most frequently , interest will not be in abundance itself , but either in the rate of population change , i.e. , the ratio of abundance in the same location at two different time points , or in the relative abundance , i.e. , the ratio of abundance at two separate locations @xcite .",
    "relative abundance is frequently monitored with the help of simpler schemes .",
    "for instance , a set of sites is randomly sampled in the area of interest , and counts of organisms are organized on these sites using a given protocol . at a given location",
    ", the resulting count can be used as an index of the true abundance . indeed , assuming constant detectability over space and time",
    ", the average number of animals counted per sampled site is proportional to the true abundance of the species in the area .",
    "log - linear models can be used to represent this average number of animals detected per site as a function of space and/or time ( and , possibly , other factors such as the habitat ; see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thereby , to infer population trends .",
    "thus , such programs have been implemented in many countries to monitor the changes in the abundance of several groups of species , such as birds ( e.g. , for the french breeding bird survey , see * ? ? ? * ) or butterflies ( e.g. , for the european butterfly monitoring scheme , see * ? ? ?",
    "estimates of relative abundance have also been commonly used for mapping the spatial distribution of several species ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to such data characterized by a known sampling effort , a large amount of data can also be collected by non - standardized means , with no sampling design and no standardized protocol . in particular",
    ", the distribution of the observers and of their sampling effort is often unknown @xcite .",
    "these so - called `` opportunistic data '' have always existed , and with the recent development of citizen science programs , we observe a massive increase in the collection of these data on a growing number of species ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally ,",
    "as the use of online databases facilitates the exchange and storage of data , such opportunistic data may now include millions of new observations per year that are collected in areas covering hundreds of thousands of square kilometres ( e.g. , the global biodiversity information facility , including more than 500 million records at the time of writing , see * ? ? ?",
    "the temporal and spatial distributions of the observations in such data reflect unknown distributions of both observational efforts and biodiversity .",
    "thus , a report of a high number of individuals of a given species at a given location compared to other locations could be because the focus species is abundant at this location or because numerous observers were present at this location .",
    "using such opportunistic data to estimate changes in the space and time of species abundance is therefore complex , since any modeling approach should include a submodel of the observation process @xcite or an attempt to manipulate the data to remove the bias caused by unequal effort ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "as noted by @xcite , `` in some situations , it may be appropriate to share or borrow information about population parameters for rare species from multiple data sources .",
    "the general concept is that by combining the data , where appropriate , more accurate estimates of the parameters may be obtained . '' in this paper , we propose a general framework which enables to combine data with known observational effort ( which we call `` standardized '' data ) with `` opportunistic '' data with an unknown sampling effort .",
    "we focus on multi - species and multi - site data that correspond to the data typically collected in this context .",
    "the purpose of this study is to estimate the relative abundance of the species at different sites ( different locations and/or times ) .",
    "we base this estimation on two datasets recording the number of animals detected by observers for each species of a pool of species of interest and each spatial unit of a study area of interest : ( i ) one `` standardized '' dataset is collected under a program characterized by a known sampling effort , possibly varying among spatial units , ( ii ) one `` opportunistic '' dataset is characterized by a completely unknown sampling effort .",
    "we take into account the variation across species of their detectability , yet , as a first step , we assume that the observational bias towards some species are the same across the different sites .",
    "we show that , under this assumption , the information concerning both the distribution of the observational effort and the biodiversity can be efficiently retrieved from `` opportunistic '' data by combining them with standardized data .",
    "moreover , we prove that such a combination returns more accurate estimates than when using the standardized data alone .",
    "our statistical framework allowing this win - win combination can open numerous avenues for application .",
    "we used data on french birds , which are typical of existing data , to illustrate the numerous qualities of this framework .",
    "note however that the work presented in this paper is a first step , and that further work will be required to fully account for varying observational bias towards some habitat types across the different sites . during the reviewing process of this paper",
    ", we became aware of an independent and simultaneous work by @xcite which develops similar ideas for combining multi - species and multi - sites data with thinned poisson models .",
    "we want to estimate the relative abundance ( relative number of individuals ) of @xmath0 species in @xmath1 sites .",
    "the `` sites '' @xmath2 can either refer to different spatial sites , to different times , or to different combinations of sites and times . we suppose that we have access to @xmath3 datasets indexed by @xmath4 which gather counts for each species @xmath5 at each site @xmath2 .",
    "we have in mind a case where some datasets have been collected with some standardized protocol , while some others are of opportunistic nature .",
    "let @xmath6 be the count of individuals of the species @xmath5 by the observers in the site @xmath2 in the dataset @xmath4 . in this paper , we propose to model the counts @xmath6 by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of individuals ( animals , plants , etc ) of a species @xmath5 at site @xmath2 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are two parameters accounting for the bias induced by the observational processes .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 reflects both the detectability of the species @xmath5 ( some species are more conspicuous than others , some are more easily trapped , etc . ) and the detection / reporting rate of this species in the dataset @xmath4 ( the attention of the observers may systematically vary among species ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 reflects the impact of the varying observational effort ( including number and duration of visits , number of traps , etc . ) and the varying observational conditions met during the counting sessions . in the next two sections",
    ", we explain the origin of our modeling , the hypotheses under which it is valid ( see also the discussion section  [ sec : discussion ] ) , and we describe precisely the meaning of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to the appendix  [ sec : thinned ] for a discussion on the link with models based on thinned poisson processes . before moving to these modeling issues ,",
    "we point out that estimation can be easily carried out in the model  ( [ model ] ) , since it can be recast into a linear generalized model , see section  [ sec : estimation ] .      the count @xmath6 of individuals of the species",
    "@xmath5 in the site @xmath2 for the dataset @xmath4 is assumed to gather the counts from all visits in the site @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that an individual is only counted _ once during a single visit _ , yet it can be counted _ several times _ in any dataset due to the possible _ multiple visits _ to a site @xmath2 for a dataset @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we may have @xmath6 larger than the number @xmath8 of individuals of the species @xmath5 in the site @xmath2 . in the following , we neglect identification errors and false positives .    for an individual @xmath11 of the species @xmath5 in the site @xmath2 and a visit @xmath12 in the site @xmath2 for the dataset @xmath4",
    ", we define the random variable @xmath13 which equals 1 if the individual @xmath11 has been _ seen and recorded _ during the visit @xmath12 , and 0 otherwise . assuming that there is no multiple count of an individual during a single visit , the count @xmath6 is then given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the set of all the visits @xmath12 in the site @xmath2 for the dataset @xmath4 . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the probability for the individual @xmath11 to be seen and recorded during the visit @xmath12 .",
    "if we assume that the random variables @xmath17 are independent and that @xmath18 ( which happens when @xmath19 is small ) , then , according to le cam inequality  @xcite , the count @xmath6 follows approximatively the poisson distribution @xmath20 the parameter @xmath21 corresponds to the average probability to detect and report during the visit @xmath12 an individual of the species @xmath5 which has been sampled at random in the site @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that the mean of the poisson distribution @xmath22 is the product of a first term @xmath8 , which is the number of individuals of the species @xmath5 present in the site @xmath2 , by a second term @xmath23 , which is a nuisance term due to the observational process .",
    "we underline that the term @xmath23 can be larger than 1 when the number @xmath24 of visits in the site @xmath2 for the dataset @xmath4 is large , since an individual can be counted several times during the @xmath24 visits .",

    "the parameter @xmath32 represents the influence of the observational conditions during the visit @xmath12 on the detection / reporting probability .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is then a very complex function of the observational duration , the visibility conditions ( weather conditions during the visit , vegetation met , etc . ) and many other variables that affect the detection / reporting probability ( number of traps , length of line transects , etc . ) .",
    "when the decomposition  ( [ example1 ] ) holds , we have the decomposition  ( [ assume : main ] ) with @xmath33 .",

    "this situation formally corresponds to the case where @xmath170 . for @xmath152 , the limit variance of the estimator @xmath158",
    "is ( see formula  ( [ var3 ] ) in the appendix  [ appendix : proof ] ) @xmath171 because the species @xmath5 is not monitored in dataset 0 , the ( normalized ) relative abundance @xmath95 can not be estimated with the sole dataset 0 .",
    "thus , there is an obvious improvement to be made by using our estimation scheme that combines the two datasets . to reveal the power of our approach ,",
    "let us compare the variance @xmath172 of our relative abundance estimator with the variance of the imaginary estimator @xmath173 based on an imaginary dataset 0 where the species @xmath5 would have been monitored with some ( imaginary ) detection / reporting probability @xmath174 .",
    "the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath173 of @xmath95 with this imaginary dataset 0 would be @xmath175 so that @xmath176 in particular , the estimation provided by @xmath148 can significantly outperform the imaginary estimation we would have obtained with the sole imaginary dataset 0 ( where the species @xmath5 would have been monitored ) .",
    "moreover , if we compare the estimator @xmath158 with the imaginary estimator @xmath177 based on both the imaginary dataset @xmath75 and the dataset @xmath77 , we observe that the ratio of their variance @xmath178 remains close to one when @xmath179 .",
    "this means that with our estimation scheme , there is not much difference between the estimation based on a dataset collected with known observational intensities where a species @xmath5 is rare and the estimation based on a dataset collected with known observational intensities where a species @xmath5 is not monitored . in other words , there is no instability on the estimation of the relative abundance of a species when it is not present in the dataset collected with known observational intensities .",
    "in this section , we investigate on some datasets the predictive power of our modeling approach .",

    "note that the quadrat cell containing the bordeaux metropolitan area ( indicated by an asterisk in ( a ) ) has been removed from the dataset.,width=566 ]    we first describe the opportunistic dataset .",
    "we used the recent online database developed by the ligue de protection des oiseaux ( lpo , bird life representative in france , largest french bird watcher ngo , with regional delegations ) .",
    "this online system was launched successively by the different regional lpo groups , and we acquired data from one of the first groups to start , aquitaine , south - western france , with data collection starting in 2007 ( www.fauneaquitaine.org ) . any citizen who can identify bird species can register on this website and record any bird observation s / he wishes , noting the species , date , and location ( to the nearest 500 m ) .",
    "hundreds of observers thus record hundreds of thousands observations .",
    "we typically ignore why these observations were made , e.g. , the motivation of the observer , the reason for choosing to report these observations over others , whether they report all the species they have seen at a given place and time , the underlying observational intensity , etc .",
    "we selected all such opportunistic records between april and mid - june 20082011 .",
    "for each record , we considered the number of animals detected by the observer .",
    "data were pooled over years , because we will focus here only on spatial variation in relative abundance .",
    "over 115  000 species records detected in a non - urban habitat were considered in this study ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "we then describe the dataset collected with known observational intensity , used for the fit of the model .",
    "we used the data from the act monitoring plan jointly carried out by the french national game and wildlife agency ( oncfs , office national de la chasse et de la faune sauvage ) , the national hunter association ( fnc , fdration nationale des chasseurs ) and the french departemental hunters associations ( fdc , fdrations dpartementales des chasseurs ) . the main objective of the act survey was to monitor the breeding populations of several migratory bird species in france @xcite ; act stands for _ alaudidae _ , _ columbidae _ , _ turdidae _ , which were the main bird clades of interest for this monitoring , though this program also monitors several _ corvidae",
    "_ species ( see table [ tab : tab2 ] for the list of species of interest for our study ) .",
    "thus , only a fraction of the species recorded by the lpo program was also studied by the act survey .",
    "the aquitaine region was discretized into 64 quadrat cells , and in each cell , a 4 km long route was randomly sampled in the non - urban habitat of the cell ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ) .",
    "each route included 5 points separated by exactly 1 km .",
    "each route was traveled twice between april and mid - june , and every point was visited for exactly 10 minutes within 4 hours after sunrise in appropriate weather conditions .",
    "every bird heard or seen was recorded , and for each point and each species , the maximum count among the two visits was retained .",
    "the observers were professionals from the technical staff of either the oncfs or the hunters associations .",
    "note that due to organization constraints , some listening points in a site were not necessarily counted every year . between 2008 and 2011 , over 9  500 birds were counted .",
    "finally , we describe the validation dataset , used to assess the predictive power of our model .",
    "we used the data from the stoc program ( _ suivi temporel des oiseaux communs _ ) , a french breeding bird survey carried out by the french museum of natural history ( mnhn , museum national dhistoire naturelle ) for the same region and the same years .",
    "the stoc survey @xcite is based on a stratified random sampling , with each volunteer observer being assigned a 2 @xmath180 2 km square randomly chosen within 10 km of his house .",
    "the observer then homogeneously distributed 10 points within the square .",
    "each point was visited twice between april and mid - june ( before and after may 8th , with at least 4 weeks between visits ) for exactly 5 minutes within 4 hours after sunrise in appropriate weather conditions ( no rain or strong winds ) .",
    "every bird heard or seen was recorded , and for each point and each species , the maximum count among the two visits was retained .",
    "these counts were then summed for a given square , year and species . between 2008 and 2011",
    ", 251 listening points belonging to 29 such squares have been surveyed in non - urban habitat ( to allow the comparison with the other datasets , we removed the listening points located in urban habitat ) , most of them for several years , and over 15241 birds were detected by the observers .",
    "our aim was to test our model ability to provide a better prediction of the spatial variation in species relative abundance than any model based on either of the two datasets alone .",
    "the `` sites '' of our model were the 63 quadrat cells defined for the act survey ; we removed the quadrat cell containing the metropolitan area of bordeaux ( a large town with a population of @xmath181 1 million inhabitants ) , where the sampling process in the opportunistic dataset could not be supposed to be the same as in the other areas ( see fig .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we investigated the ability of our method to estimate the relative abundance of species not monitored in the act survey .",
    "note that the between - site variance of the log relative abundance estimated with our method @xmath183 was larger in average for the species monitored in the act survey ( median = 2.41 , iqr = 1.1  104 ) than for the species not monitored in this survey ( median = 1.15 , iqr = 1.04  1.34 ) , which resulted in smaller pearson s coefficient for the latter species ( tab .",

    "our approach performed better than the approaches based on the dataset @xmath184 or @xmath185 alone .",
    "the predictive power of our approach and the approach @xmath186 were similar .",
    "actually , the log observational intensity estimated in a site by our approach for the lpo dataset was strongly correlated with the logarithm of the total number of birds detected in this site ( pearson s @xmath187 = 0.85 ) , which supports to some extent the common practice of biologists to use the total number of birds detected in a place as a measure of the observational intensity .",
    "we propose a general approach to estimate relative abundances of multiple species on multiple  sites  ( corresponding to different times and/or locations ) by combining one or several datasets collected according to some standardized protocol with one or several datasets of opportunistic nature .",
    "the estimation is performed with the generalized linear model  ( [ glm ] ) .",
    "this modeling relies on several assumptions , including : ( i ) the datasets have the same spatiotemporal extent , ( ii ) the individuals of the monitored species do not cluster into large groups , ( iii ) either the habitat types are known or the observational bias towards some habitat types are the same across the different sites . in particular , the third hypothesis is quite restrictive and handling cases where it is not met requires significant additional modeling .",
    "we have demonstrated both theoretically ( under the assumption that the model is well - specified ) and numerically on some datasets , that combining opportunistic data with standardized surveys produces more reliable estimates of the relative abundances than either dataset alone . in particular , we observe an improvement in our example section  [ sec : illustration ] even if the above hypothesis ( iii ) is probably violated .",
    "we have also shown that combining opportunistic data with standardized data allows for estimating relative abundance for species which are not monitored in the standardized dataset .",
    "our approach for combining opportunistic data with survey data is quite general : it requires to be extended in order to overcome the current limitations ( see the discussion in the next section ) and to be adapted to the specifics of each case study .",
    "yet , we highlight two already promising applications of our framework .",
    "first , we emphasize that our framework can be readily used to estimate temporal changes . in such cases , the  sites  @xmath2 correspond to different times @xmath2 and @xmath78 represent the parameters describing the unknown observational intensity at time @xmath2 for the opportunistic dataset . for temporal variation ,",
    "biased attention for some habitats in the opportunistic dataset will meet the hypothesis ( iii ) as long as this biased attention is constant over time . as explained in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , such biases will be entirely captured in the estimation of the @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the accuracy of bird population trends for france will be considerably improved by the addition of opportunistic data to the current breeding bird surveys .",
    "another very interesting feature of our framework is its ability to estimate the relative abundance of very rare species , even if these species are not monitored with a scheme with known sampling effort .",
    "this has important practical implications .",
    "for example , @xcite noted `` in a sample of 550 plots surveyed in a random - stratified way based on the elevation , slope , and aspect of the plot during two consecutive summers in the swiss alps ( 704.2 km@xmath188 ) , not one occurrence of the rare and endangered plant species _ eryngium alpinum _ l. was recorded .",
    "this was despite the species being easily detectable if present and independent records of the species existing in the area within similar vegetation types .",
    "'' our framework would be very useful in this context .",
    "in particular , if a citizen science program collects opportunistic data on this species along with some other more common species , then the relative abundance of the rare species can be estimated by combining these opportunistic data with standardized surveys monitoring the same common species .",
    "we derived from our analysis section  [ sec : count : modeling ] a model based on the poisson distribution . in practice",
    ", we may observe some overdispersion in the data .",
    "causes of overdispersion include clustering of individuals , spatial auto - correlation , identification errors , etc .",
    "it is then wise to account for overdispersion in the modeling ( see section  [ sec : illustration ] ) .",
    "the main assumption in our modeling  ( [ model ] ) is that the observational bias @xmath23 can be decomposed into @xmath189 .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , this mainly amounts to assume that the habitat types are known or the observational bias towards some habitat types are the same across the different sites .",
    "this assumption will not be met in many cases and we can expect a significant improvement by taking habitat types heterogeneity into account .",
    "this issue requires a significant additional modeling and it will be developed elsewhere .    in our estimation framework",
    ", we did not take into account any variable affecting the distribution of the relative abundance in the different sites .",
    "however , it is well - known that there might be a spatial ( if the `` sites '' are spatial units ) or temporal ( if the `` sites '' are time units ) autocorrelation in the densities .",
    "for example , it is frequent that if the abundance of a given species is high in a given spatial unit , it will also be high in neighboring units .",
    "moreover , spatial units with a similar environmental composition will often be characterized by similar abundances . explicitly accounting for these patterns in the estimation process could lead to an increased accuracy of the estimation ( by reducing the effective number of parameters ) .",
    "this could be done by modeling the relative abundances @xmath95 as a function of environmental variables , or as a function of spatial effects ( e.g. using conditional autoregression effects in a hierarchical model , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively , it is possible to maximize a regularized log - likelihood , i.e. to maximize for example : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the likelihood of the model , @xmath192 is a measure of `` environmental and spatial proximities '' between the unit @xmath2 and the unit @xmath193 , and @xmath194 is a positive parameter that determines the strength of the penalty",
    ". the proximities could be of any sort ( e.g. taking the value 1 if the two spatial units are neighbours , and 0 otherwise ; inverse euclidean distances between the units in the space defined by the environmental variables , etc . ) .",
    "this kind of regularization would reduce the number of effective parameters in the model and thereby increase the accuracy of the estimation ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "our statistical approach relies on the assumption that the measurement errors ( identification errors , false positive ) were negligible .",
    "this is a common assumption in this type of study , although recent studies seem to indicate that ( i ) even a small number of false positives can lead to biases in estimates @xcite , and ( ii ) even highly trained professionals may be subject to such errors ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as a solution to this problem , @xcite proposed to combine data collected using different approaches characterized by different probabilities of identification errors ( e.g. hear counts vs. visual counts ) .",
    "this approach has not yet been thoroughly tested though , especially in the context of ( relative ) abundance estimation .",
    "taking into account measurement errors in our framework , e.g. by integrating the approach of @xcite , still requires further study .",
    "the detectability of a given species is not necessarily constant across sites @xmath2 in the standardized dataset , as documented in the literature @xcite",
    ". this unaccounted variation of detection probability will result into an unaccounted variation of the observational intensity .",
    "because the knowledge of this intensity plays a crucial role in the fit of the model , such errors may bias the estimates if this variation of detection probability is structured according to some exogenous variables ( e.g. habitat types ) .",
    "many statistical frameworks based on a particular sampling design have been suggested to estimate detectability , such as using mixture models based on repeated counts @xcite .",
    "further work is required to adapt such methods to our proposed framework .",
    "we warmly thank the members of the cisstats group for stimulating and fruitful discussions on opportunistic data and related statistical issues .",
    "we also thank laurent couzy and ondine filippi - codaccioni for facilitating access to the lpo - aquitaine database .",

    "have shown the close connections existing between ipps and resource selection functions , a commonly used approach to model habitat selection by the wildlife @xcite .",
    "moreover , ipps have also been shown to generalize other statistical approaches commonly used to model species distribution , such as the maxent approach @xcite or the classical logistic regression @xcite .",
    "we compare the ipp with our approach in this section .",
    "the framework of ipps suppose that the individuals of the species @xmath5 are distributed on a domain @xmath195 according to a poisson point process with intensity @xmath196 .",
    "if we assume that the individual at location @xmath197 is detected and recorded in the dataset @xmath4 with probability @xmath198 , then the individuals of the species @xmath5 recorded in the dataset @xmath4 are distributed according to a poisson point process with intensity @xmath199 .",
    "the multiplication of @xmath200 with @xmath198 results in a `` thinning '' of the ipp ; for this reason , the resulting point process is sometimes called thinned - poisson process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that in the context of ipps , each individual is supposed to be counted at most once in each dataset ( undercounting ) . on the contrary , in section",
    "[ sec : count : modeling ] , we allowed multiple counts of a single individual during the multiple visits in a site , which makes our development more sensible for studies characterized by a strong observational intensity ( which is generally the case of citizen science data ) .",
    "however , even with this difference , our model  ( [ model ] ) can be motivated in the context of ipps .",
    "we can adopt different points of view for estimating relative abundances with this modeling based on ipps .",
    "a first point of view is to introduce a model for the abundance intensities @xmath196 and the probabilities @xmath198 and then estimate these quantities accordingly .",
    "such a point of view has been successfully developed in a simultaneous and independent work by @xcite : they model the abundances intensities by @xmath201 with @xmath202 some observed environmental variables , the probabilities by @xmath203 with @xmath204 some other observed environmental variable and @xmath205 at locations where survey data are available and @xmath206 , else .",

    "an alternative point of view , which corresponds to the point of view developed in this paper , is not to try to infer the intensities @xmath196 for each @xmath197 , but instead , to work at the scale of a whole site @xmath212 and infer the mean abundance @xmath213 of the species @xmath5 on @xmath214 .",
    "an important feature is that we do not model the abundance intensities @xmath196 and the probabilities @xmath198 in terms of some observed environmental variables , but rather simply assume some structural properties on these functions .",

    "the number @xmath6 of individuals of the species @xmath5 counted in the site @xmath216 in the dataset @xmath4 is then distributed according to @xmath219 let us describe some scenarii , where the observational bias @xmath23 can be decomposed as @xmath189 , leading to the model  ( [ model ] ) .    in the three examples below",
    ", we will assume that the detection / reporting probability @xmath198 can be decomposed in @xmath220 with @xmath221 not depending on @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the detection / reporting bias @xmath222 towards the species @xmath5 in the dataset @xmath4 is independent of the location @xmath197 ( in other words the functions @xmath223 are proportional one to the others ) .",
    "when this property is met we have the decomposition @xmath224 the decomposition does not give a decomposition @xmath189 in general .",
    "yet , such a decomposition arises in the three scenarii described below ( which are the counterparts of the three examples described in section  [ sec : assumptions ] ) .",
    "* example 1 : sites with homogeneous habitat type . *",
    "assume that the species intensity ratios @xmath225 depend on the species @xmath226 and the site @xmath216 , but not on the location @xmath218 .",
    "such a property is likely to be met if the site @xmath216 has an homogeneous habitat type . in this case , we have @xmath227 and hence @xmath228 for all @xmath5 and @xmath218 .",
    "then , we have @xmath229    * example 2 : observations with known habitat type .",
    "* in this example , we assume that for each observation we know in which habitat type @xmath230 it has occurred ( in particular , it will be the case if we know the location @xmath197 of each observation ) .",
    "exactly as in the example 2 in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , we define @xmath231 as the couple @xmath44 .",
    "assume that the density distribution @xmath232 depends on the species @xmath5 only through the habitat @xmath230 of @xmath197 : for any @xmath226 and @xmath233 such that @xmath234 we have @xmath235 .",
    "in this case , we have a decomposition @xmath236 for all @xmath218 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath237 the portion of the site @xmath214 with habitat type @xmath39 .",
    "for any @xmath238 and @xmath44 , the counts @xmath45 of individuals of the species @xmath5 in the habitat @xmath39 in the site @xmath2 for the dataset @xmath4 is distributed according to @xmath239 we then have the decomposition @xmath240 with @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that in this case the probability @xmath241 appearing in the decomposition  ( [ ipp : bias ] ) is allowed to depend on the habitat type @xmath39 ( the bias towards some species may differ depending on the habitat type ) .",
    "* example 3 : homogeneous distribution of habitat types .",
    "* we do not assume anymore that the habitat type @xmath230 for each observation is known .",
    "we assume again that we have the decomposition @xmath236 for all @xmath218 , hence @xmath242 if we assume in addition that @xmath243 then @xmath244 let us investigate when the decomposition  ( [ ipp : prop2bis ] ) can be met .",
    "assume first that @xmath245 where @xmath246 reflects local fluctuations independent of the habitat type .",

    "we then have @xmath250 when the ratios @xmath251 do not depend on @xmath2 , the above ratio depends on @xmath39 and @xmath4 only , so  ( [ ipp : prop2bis ] ) holds .",
    "this case corresponds to sites @xmath214 all having a similar distribution of habitat types .",
    "this property will be met if the sites @xmath214 correspond to the same location at different times @xmath2 .",
    "with the notations @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 , the model  ( 1 ) described in our paper can be recast as a classical generalized linear model @xmath255 the kernel of the design matrix associated with this linear regression has a dimension equal to @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , we need @xmath119 constraints to ensure the identifiability of the model .        to keep the mathematical analysis of the maximum likelihood estimators comprehensible , we focus below on the case where the @xmath146 are known .",
