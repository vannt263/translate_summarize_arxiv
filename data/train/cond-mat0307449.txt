    "the quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) @xcite 2h-@xmath0 , 2h-@xmath1 , 2h-@xmath2 and 2h-@xmath3 are layered compounds where superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave ( cdw ) state @xcite .",
    "it has been documented experimentally that these materials present anomalous properties such as a decrease of the resistivity and decoupling between planar and c - axis transport in the cdw phase @xcite , anomalous impurity effects on the superconductivity and non - linear hall effect @xcite , stripe phases @xcite , and more recently angle resolved photoemission experiments ( arpes ) have shown a quasi - particle lifetime diverging linearly with the energy close to the fermi surface @xcite in contrast to ordinary fermi liquids where the lifetime diverges quadratically with energy .",
    "some of these properties are similar to the ones observed in high temperature superconductors ( htc ) @xcite .",
    "contrary to htc , however , tmd are extremely clean systems and therefore the anomalous behavior is undoubtedly intrinsic and sample independent",
    ". therefore the understanding of the anomalous metallic behavior in these 2d materials may provide clues for the understanding of the anomalous physics that occurs in a broad class of 2d systems where superconductivity occurs .",
    "one of us ( ahcn ) , has proposed recently an unified picture of the cdw and superconducting transitions that can explain some of the anomalies observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the theory proposes that the mechanism of superconductivity is related to the pairing of the cdw elementary excitations mediated by acoustic phonons via a piezoelectric coupling .",
    "these excitations are dirac electrons situated in the nodes of a cdw gap , resembling the fermi surface zone of graphite . in tmd , unlike the case of graphite , the lattice inversion symmetry is broken in the cdw phase .",
    "the breaking of the inversion symmetry in tmd , as documented in neutron scattering experiments @xcite , allows for a piezoelectric coupling between charge carriers and phonons @xcite .",
    "since cdw formation is usually related to nested fermi surfaces in 1d systems , weak 2d nesting combined with strong variations in the electron phonon coupling due to the tight - binding nature of the electronic orbitals , can be responsible for the origin of the nodal cdw order parameter .",
    "this model is able to correctly explain some of the anomalous properties of tmd such as the energy dependence of the quasi - particle lifetime ( given by the imaginary part of the dirac fermion self - energy ) , the critical dependence of the superconducting transition with the lattice parameters , the reduction of the resistivity , and the metallic behavior in the cdw phase .",
    "however , a criticism has been raised to this theory based on the fact that piezoelectricity normally occurs in insulating systems since metals can screen the internal electric fields @xcite .",
    "however , dirac fermions in 2d have a vanishing density of states at the fermi energy and therefore do not screen electric fields @xcite allowing for the existence of a metallic state ( that is , a state with gapless fermionic excitations ) and piezoelectricity . nevertheless , the possibility of coexistence of piezoelectricity and superconductivity is indeed surprising . in such a system",
    "it would be possible to generate super - currents by simply squeezing the sample . in this work",
    "we show that there is no contradiction between the existence of piezoelectricity and superconductivity in materials where the low - lying excitations are dirac fermions .",
    "we investigate the current and charge fluctuations that would arise in these systems under the view point of the collective modes .    using path integrals",
    "we derive a semi - classical action that describes the coupling between plasmons ( responsible for screening ) and acoustic phonons to the superconducting order parameter via the piezoelectric coupling .",
    "various well - known regimes are described by this action : ( 1 ) in the case of normal electrons without superconductivity we recover the well - known results for collective modes and screening in 2d and 3d @xcite ; ( 2 ) in the case of dirac fermions without superconductivity we re - obtain the results for collective modes and screening in semi - metals like graphite @xcite ; ( 3 ) in the absence of piezoelectric coupling , we recover the behavior of an ordinary type ii superconductor @xcite . however , when we allow the piezoelectric coupling with dirac fermions and superconductivity , new effects appear in the electromagnetic response . moreover , our results shed light on the origin of the quantum phase transition between the commensurate cdw phase and the stripe phase in tmd .",
    "we also investigate the collective modes that appear when combined with low lying energy bulk plasmons .",
    "the article is organized in the following manner : in section ii we discuss the plasmons in layered nodal liquids and specifically in tmd ; in section iii we develop the semi - classical calculation in general grounds and apply it to layered compounds like tmd in section iv .",
    "we have added an appendix where the details of the calculation are presented .",
    "the field theory of nodal liquids @xcite is built under the basic idea that the nodes of a cdw order parameter lead to two distinct subsystems which correspond to the two components of the dirac fermion spinor @xmath4 , with @xmath5,@xmath6 indexing respectively the fermionic particles and anti - particles ( holes ) .",
    "the non - interacting low energy hamiltonian that describes the elementary excitations inside the dirac cone is : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the momentum , @xmath9 are pauli matrices that act in the particle - anti - particle subspace , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the anisotropic velocities perpendicular and parallel respectively to the fermi surface , and @xmath12 is the first brillouin zone of size @xmath13 along the @xmath14 axis ( @xmath15 the inter - plane distance ) .",
    "when the chemical potential , @xmath16 , intercepts the dirac point , the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) leads to the zero order polarization function @xcite at @xmath17 , whose complex conjugate is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the frequency , @xmath20 the anisotropic in - plane momentum . in the absence of hopping between the planes or interactions with the lattice , the collective excitations of the dirac fermions are due to the 3d coulomb interaction , @xmath21 , between carriers in different planes : @xmath22 , with a structure factor @xmath23 $ ] identical to the layered electron gas ( leg ) case @xcite ( @xmath24 is the electron charge , and @xmath25 the dielectric constant ) . in the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "the electric susceptibility is given by : @xmath26 .",
    "at the points where the susceptibility vanishes , that is , @xmath27 , one obtains the plasmon dispersion , @xmath28 . from ( [ p ] )",
    ", we notice that no plasmon modes are allowed for dirac fermions .",
    "the displacement of the chemical potential from the dirac point generates a pocket around the nodes which drastically changes this picture .",
    "the density of states becomes finite at the fermi surface with fermi momentum @xmath29 , and fermi energy @xmath30 , giving rise to intra - band excitations in the cone .",
    "in this case we recover the optic plasmon @xmath31 for the @xmath32 bulk mode , where @xmath33 is the plasmon speed , and the 2d acoustic mode @xmath34 for the rest of the plasmon band @xmath35 .",
    "the intra - band contribution is satisfactorily understood in the context of doped graphite @xcite where for @xmath36 there is gap in the particle - hole continuum of the inter - band excitations ( see fig.1 ) defined by the imaginary part of ( [ p ] ) .",
    "the optical plasmon is free of landau damping in the long wavelength limit and its energy is of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "notice that in the anisotropic case ( @xmath38 ) the gap in the plasmon spectrum depends on the direction around the pocket fermi surface .",
    "if we also add the piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling @xcite @xmath39 due to acoustic phonons ( with phonon field @xmath40 ) with energy @xmath41 into the pocket excitations , the rpa electric susceptibility acquires a correction : @xmath42 \\pi^{0}(\\omega,\\mathbf{q},\\mu ) $ ] where @xcite @xmath43 is the phonon propagator that affects very little the optical bulk plasmon in the @xmath44 limit .",
    "besides doping , coherent inter - layer hopping is known to drive a dimensional crossover in direction to a 3d system , leading as well to a pocket formation in a nodal liquid @xcite .",
    "the energy of the pocket is of the same order of the inter - layer hopping energy , which in tmd nbse@xmath45 and nbs@xmath45 ( we will drop the 2h prefix from now on ) were calculated in @xmath46 0.1 ev @xcite .",
    "we notice that inter - layer interactions were not taken into account into those band calculations and that this energy could be considerably smaller .",
    "more experimental studies are required to investigate the nature of the low energy collective modes in these materials .",
    "however , we can consider the plasmon modes in real materials to have a finite energy , like in ordinary metals .",
    "nevertheless , the plasmon frequency will be smaller than in ordinary metals because of the low density of states in the system .",
    "we consider the problem of dirac fermions described by ( [ h1 ] ) coupled to lattice vibrations described by the hamiltonian @xmath47 where @xmath48 labels the lattice site @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the lattice momentum operator with @xmath51 ( these operators are canonically conjugated , namely , @xmath52=i \\hbar \\delta_{ij } \\delta_{nm}$ ] ) , @xmath53 is the coupling matrix . in what follows",
    "we will also consider the coupling of the dirac fermions and lattice degrees of freedom to a _ classical _ electromagnetic field described by a vector potential field , @xmath54 , and electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 with @xmath57 ) with electromagnetic energy density : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the electric field strength ( we use the metric @xmath60 ) @xcite . in a piezoelectric the electric field couples to the lattice distortion , @xmath61 , via the piezoelectric tensor , @xmath62 , by : @xmath63 where repeated indices are to be summed .",
    "the coupling between dirac fermions and lattice vibrations is given by ( [ hep ] ) .",
    "the full problem can be written in path integral form for the generating functional of the problem : @xmath64 \\right\\ } \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the lagrangian ( real time ) of the problem ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 are grassmann variables ) .",
    "let us consider first the case of the normal ( non - superconducting ) state .",
    "we are only interested in the long wavelength physics of the electronic problem which , as argued in the previous section , is described by the plasmon mode . the plasmon mode can be separated from the particle - hole continuum using the formalism developed by bohm and pines @xcite and the lagrangian of the problem reduces to : @xmath68\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa\\,[(\\partial_{t } x^{i})^2   - v_{ph}^2 ( \\partial_i x^{i } ) ^2 ]   + \\delta^{i}_{\\,\\,j } x_{i}f^{0j } , \\qquad \\label{l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the 3d electron screening wave vector ( for an isotropic metal @xmath71 where @xmath48 is the 3d electron density and @xmath72 the fermi energy @xcite ) , @xmath73 is the lattice mass density , @xmath74 is the sound velocity , @xmath75 is the density of normal electrons and @xmath76 is the normal ohmic current density ( in our notation , @xmath77 is the time derivative normalized by the speed of light @xmath78 ) .",
    "the collective properties of the electrons in the normal phase are the same of the electrons in the superconducting phase , since the opening of the superconducting gap does _ not _ affect the real part of the electronic polarization function , @xmath79 , in the long wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , within rpa one can easily show in the context of bcs theory that @xmath80 remains essentially unchanged until the superconducting gap is of the order of the fermi energy , when the bcs pairing approximation becomes invalid @xcite .",
    "in other words , for small @xmath81 the plasmon is not sensitive to the superconductor phase transition .",
    "thus , normal and superconducting electrons screen electric fields exactly in the same way and therefore enter at equal footing in the lagrangian .",
    "thus , irrespective of the phase , normal or superconducting , @xmath82 in ( [ l ] ) can be replaced by the _ total _",
    "electron density @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the density of superconducting electrons ( @xmath85 in the normal state ) .",
    "normal currents , however , are due to the quasi - particle excitations while the supercurrents , @xmath86 , are due to the ground state of the condensate @xcite .",
    "thus , in the superconducting state the vector potential only couples to the normal currents . at finite temperature , @xmath87 , the number of normal and superconducting electrons is not conserved . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen to work at @xmath17 , where all the electrons are in the condensate and the total current is @xmath88 .    in the superconducting phase",
    "we can introduce the superconducting order parameter , @xmath89 , via a standard hubbard - stratanovich transformation and trace over the electrons @xcite .",
    "the generating functional reads : @xmath90 \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",
    ". \\mathcal{l}_{gl}[\\psi,{\\bf a}]\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the ginzburg - landau lagrangian .",
    "in order to describe the macroscopic current - charge fluctuations we must also include a time dependence in the superconductor order parameter . this is not an obvious task but it can be done in two special limits : close to @xmath92 , and near the critical temperature @xcite . in the later , the validity of the time - dependent gorkov equations expansion in the gap , @xmath93 , require frequencies higher than the binding energy of the cooper pairs , @xmath94 . in this limit",
    "the fluctuations have enough energy to break the cooper pairs and convert them into single particle excitations , leading to a diffusive regime .",
    "as we mentioned above , we will work in the opposite limit @xmath95 where the hydrodynamic description at @xmath96 is rigorously valid .",
    "we introduce the low - temperature time - dependent ginzburg - landau lagrangian @xcite , @xmath97 which is specially suitable for type ii superconductors , where the penetration length is much larger than the coherence length ( in ( [ gl ] ) @xmath98 is the electrostatic potential and all the other symbols are standard @xcite ) . in the clean limit , @xmath99 is typically of the order of the fermi velocity @xmath10 . under the assumption that the fields vary much slower than the coherence length , we assume that the magnitude of the superconductor order parameter is constant and therefore all the fluctuations come from the superconducting phase , @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the order parameter is written as : @xmath101 despite the gauge invariance of ( [ gl ] ) , we conveniently assume the transverse gauge , @xmath102 , in what follows .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath103 is not complete because the fields and the supercurrents remain decoupled .",
    "this problem is solved by assuming the validity of the non - homogeneous maxwell equations .",
    "the poisson equation is clearly a constraint between the density of superconducting electrons and the electrostatic potential , @xmath104 and has to be enforced using a lagrange multiplier @xmath105 in final lagrangian .    in the semi - classical regime , @xmath106 ,",
    "the behavior of the fields comes from the minimal action principle @xmath107 with respect to the variables @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . by minimizing with respect to @xmath108 and @xmath112",
    ", we obtain the two non - homogeneous maxwell s equations , @xmath113 @xmath114 with the supercurrent @xmath115 given by @xmath116 @xmath117 +   \\ , c\\,\\delta \\,\\partial_{0 } \\mathbf{x } \\ , .\\label{j}\\ ] ] for simplicity we will assume that @xmath118 is a diagonal and isotropic tensor .",
    "the minimization with respect to the other fields completes the set of equations : @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 substituting the supercurrent in the continuity equation , @xmath122 , we find that @xmath123 and therefore , in the absence of external currents @xmath112 is either a function of space or of time , but not of both .",
    "if @xmath112 depends on time , then @xmath124 is a stationary time dependent homogeneous ( or non - periodic ) distribution because of ( [ rho ] ) , what obviously violates the charge conservation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath125 .",
    "the lagrange multiplier defines two distinct classes of solutions for the charge density : ( _ i _ ) _ screening - like _ when @xmath126 , and ( _ ii _ ) _ plasmon - like _ when @xmath127 . in the first case",
    ", @xmath128 , where @xmath129 depends on the boundary conditions , has no dynamics and describes the physical response to a boundary perturbation such as a static squeeze of the crystal or the introduction of a charge probe . in case ( _ ii _ ) , the electrons can oscillate freely with the plasmon frequency , allowing the existence of normal modes .",
    "we consider the problem of a layered solid ( such as the tmd ) made by an infinite number of weakly interacting planes . in the continuum limit",
    "this problem becomes an effective 3d model with spatial anisotropy in the direction perpendicular to the planes , say the @xmath130 axis .",

    "if the piezoelectric coupling is larger than a critical value ( @xmath155 ) , the screening is suppressed and a quasi - static charge modulation should be observed , in such way to minimize the elastic energy . this analysis is confirmed by introducing an external charge probe @xmath156 at the origin : we re - obtain the well known thomas - fermi result @xcite , @xmath157 which gives a screened potential for @xmath154 and recovers the metallic case when the cut - off of the in - plane band dispersion @xmath158 ( of the order of inverse of the in - plane lattice spacing ) is taken to infinity .    for a finite cut - off @xmath158 we have various cases . when @xmath159 , the screening is limited to the direction perpendicular to the planes .",
    "when @xmath155 and @xmath160 , the system does not show any screening since the potential decays like @xmath161 for large @xmath162 .",
    "the last possible case , @xmath155 and @xmath163 is not physical in this theory and gives a purely imaginary response .",
    "we verify that the phase of the superconducting order parameter is free of fluctuations and satisfies the zero - field vortex equation @xmath164 in the whole @xmath165 class .",
    "the collective modes follow from a slightly different calculation .",
    "we start from the plasmon solution of ( [ rhold0 ] ) , @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a function which depends not only on the boundary conditions but also on the initial conditions driven by the perturbation . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath168 ,",
    "the field solutions in the momentum space are ( the details of the calculation are given in the appendix ) : @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 where we have labeled @xmath174 equation ( [ plasmon ] ) represents the bulk plasmon mode @xmath32 , which prevails over the rest of the plasmon band .",
    "this is in agreement with a general result valid for a stack of layers coupled by coulomb interactions and by coherent hopping terms between adjacent planes .",
    "the presence of inter - layer charge transfer induces a dimensional crossover to a 3d system , which dominates the long wavelength spectrum .",
    "as we show in the end of the appendix , this effect is conditioned to the assumption that @xmath175 .",
    "the inverse of the in - plane modulation scale @xmath176 is given by the equation @xmath177 .",
    "noting that at @xmath92 the electronic density @xmath48 is twice the density of cooper pairs @xmath178 , we realize that the quantity @xmath179 can be conveniently written in the form of the expression that gives the square of the plasma frequency , @xmath180 . in general grounds , @xmath48 is given by the sum rule @xcite @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the imaginary part of the electronic susceptibility , which is given in rpa by @xmath183 and @xmath184 is the anisotropy function due to the shape of the fermi surface , with @xmath185 in the isotropic case .",

    ". the microscopic nature of this phase is still unknown but our results here suggest that it may have its origins on the piezoelectric coupling in the solid .",
    "indeed , we have found that there is a charge modulation in these materials when @xmath223 ( see eq.(26 ) ) .",
    "this modulation can be thought as an incommensuration @xmath224 .",
    "equivalently , using definition ( [ geff ] ) there is a critical coupling constant @xmath225 so that an extra charge modulation appears ( @xmath226 ) when @xmath223 or @xmath227 recall that tase@xmath45 ( @xmath228 ) and nbse@xmath45 ( @xmath229 ) are both superconductors @xcite whose @xmath230 increase under application of pressure @xcite and therefore @xmath231 at @xmath17 .",

    "the connections between tmd and ht@xmath236 are remarkable and we believe that this experimental result could be numerically calculated by relaxing the rigidity in the amplitude @xmath191 of the superconductor order parameter . in addition , we suggest that similar electrostatic devices combined with neutron scattering could test experimentally the role of the piezoelectricity in tmd stripe phases .",

    "the system is not screened and a long - range charge modulation is expected to appear as the response to a local quasi - static charge unbalance , which can be created by squeezing the crystal .",
    "we have shown that piezoelectricity is possibly related to the mechanism behind the stripe formation in tmd .",
    "besides , we have investigated the existence of zero temperature normal modes arising in the presence of low energy bulk plasmons , which dominate the spectrum of collective excitations .",
    "we have also conjectured that the @xmath32 plasmon mode behind these excitations comes from the contribution of the intra - band excitations of a pocket opened around the nodes of tmd by low energy coherent hopping terms between adjacent planes .",
