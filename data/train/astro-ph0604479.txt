    "our clfs are mostly independent of the exact value assumed for @xmath57 as long as it below the minimum luminosity probed by observations .",
    "to describe the total luminosity of a halo , we make use of the following phenomenological form : @xmath59 here , @xmath60 denotes the mass scale at which satellites begin to appear in dark matter halos with luminosities of those in the given bin and @xmath61 is the power - law slope in the luminosity , in addition to the slope of the total luminosity  halo mass relation .",

    "the parameter constraints are shown in fig .  4 with the left panel using the ouchi et al .",

    "( 2004a ) and sawicki & thompson ( 2005 ) lfs are consistent with @xmath105 , a value for @xmath53 of 0 is ruled at more than 3@xmath6 confidence .",
    "it is likely that the rest - uv lf evolves in a complicated manner and a simple description based on pure luminosity evolution , where one shifts the low redshift lf to high redshifts so as to make all galaxies brighter by the same factor , is not appropriate .",
    "an analysis of the rest b - band lfs from @xmath102 to @xmath106 revealed a similar result in cooray ( 2005b ) .    in fig .  5",

    "such a mass dependent increase in luminosity at high redshifts is consistent with the `` down - sizing '' picture that has been regularly discussed in the context of galaxy evolution ( cowie et al . 1996 ) .",
    "while lfs and galaxy bias allow model fits to the central galaxy clf , we now consider clustering of lbgs at @xmath23 and fit the autocorrelation function where non - linear clustering is determined by satellites .",
    "we make use of the redshift distribution discussed in section  2 . to study how our results are affected by uncertainties in the redshift distribution",
    ", we also calculated parameter constraints by assuming that all galaxies are at a redshift of 4 and determined that best - fit parameters change slightly , but is still below the 1@xmath6 ranges allowed by the data when including either the redshift distribution or assuming all galaxies are at the same redshift .",
    "thus , we do not consider uncertainties in the redshift distribution to be a limitation of our analysis .",
    "when fitting the autocorrelation function , we vary two parameters that describe the appearance of satellite galaxies ( @xmath60 and @xmath62 ) in equation  3 . we only consider measurements with @xmath107 for reasons described earlier in the text .",

    "7 and 8 results are shown using the @xmath38 relation based on the ouchi et al .",
    "( 2004a ) lf ; when constraints from the sawicki & thompson ( 2005 ) lf is used , we found best - fit values of @xmath62 and @xmath60 to vary by , at most , 20% especially in the faintest luminosity bin . while there is a general trend for @xmath60 to increase with increasing luminosity of galaxies ,",
    "this trend is not well established given the overlapping error bars of @xmath60 estimates . if @xmath110 , the trend becomes clear with a difference in @xmath60 amounting to a factor of 4 to 5 between the faintest and the brightest luminosity bin .",
    "however , there is no reason to restrict @xmath62 to high values , though additional clustering measurements will allow parameters related to the satellite clf be improved .    on the other hand , a clear trend exists for the fraction of galaxies that appear as satellites in the three luminosity bins considered here .",
    "we calculate the satellite fraction via @xmath111 in figure  9 , as an example , we show contours of constant @xmath112 values as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath62 overlaid on the constraints from model fits to galaxy clustering in @xmath113 magnitude bin .",
    "the satellite fraction , @xmath112 , traces the degeneracy direction in the @xmath60@xmath62 plane and is a parameter that is slightly better determined from the data .    in figure  10 , we show probability distribution for @xmath112 based again on the likelihood analysis .",
    "the fraction of galaxies that appear as satellites is @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 magnitude bins respectively , if one uses constraints on the @xmath38 relation from ouchi et al .",

    "the difference , however , exists mostly in the lowest luminosity bin with a 25% change in the best - fit value , while at the highest luminosity bin , fractions from the two lfs agree with each other .",
    "this is probably a reflection that the two lfs agree at the bright - end and the differences in the two lfs only exist at the faint - end . in both cases",

    "11 left panel , for reference , we show the best - fit halo occupation numbers as a function of the galaxy luminosity .",
    "here , we only use the best - fit parameters when describing the satellite clf here , though there are large variations in both the slope of the luminosity distribution of satellite galaxies and the mass scale in which satellites first begin to appear at a given luminosity . in the right panel of fig .  11",
    ", we also show the probability distribution function of halo mass to host galaxies in a given luminosity bin ( following equation  5 ) .",
    "we show both central galaxy ( solid lines ) and satellite ( dashed lines ) probability distribution functions .",
    "note the clear dependence of luminosity with halo mass for central galaxies .",
    "these probability distribution functions can be compared with the ones derived for low - redshift galaxies in cooray ( 2005c ) .",
    "in fact , a trend can be established for central galaxies at a given luminosity to evolve in halos of varying dark matter mass as a function of redshift .",
    "this trend is such that the halo mass increased as the redshift is lowered for galaxies with high luminosities .",
    "the difference between the halo masses of faint central galaxies as a function of redshift is not significant .",
    "these differences can be understood in terms of the difference in @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xmath38 relations ( shown in fig .",
    "it could be that these trends can be explained through hierarchical merger models that trace the merger rates of dark matter halos from high redshift to low redshifts ( e.g. , hamana et al .",
    "2005 ) and such models can be further improved with more accurate clustering measurements as a function of redshift and luminosity .",
    "in addition to simply establishing the mass scale , the probability distribution functions shown in fig .",
    "11 can be compared with dynamical mass estimates for same galaxies to study the importance of merger - bias ( furlanetto & kamionkowski 2005 ) and corrections associated with age dependences to the bias ( e.g. , gao et al .",
    "the lack of dynamical mass estimates for @xmath0 lbg sample , however , prohibits us from making such a comparison .",
    "in addition to dynamical measurements , another useful avenue to explore would be a lensing - based mass measurement for lbg galaxies .",
    "while an adequate surface density of lensed background galaxies behind lbgs are unlikely to be recovered even in deep imaging data , a combination of the lensed cosmic microwave background anisotropy map at high resolution and foreground lbg samples binned in luminosity may make such an analysis eventually possible .",
    "to summarize our discussion involving model descriptions of luminosity - dependent clustering at @xmath122 , our main results are :    \\(1 ) we have remeasured galaxy autocorrelation function in the @xmath122 lbg sample of the subaru / xmm - newton deep field . while ouchi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) considered galaxy clustering as a function of the increasing faint - end magnitude , while the bright - end is fixed the same , here we have considered three independent bins in luminosity .",
    "we have made high signal - to - noise ratio measurements of clustering in three luminosity bins from 24.5 to 27.5 in observed @xmath1-band at steps of unity in magnitude .",
    "\\(2 ) in addition to these clustering measurements and the linear large - scale bias factor for lbgs as a function of the luminosity derived from the data , we also analyze the @xmath122 lbg lf from ouchi et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and sawicki & thompson ( 2005 ) .",
    "we make use of these two luminosity functions as they span a wide range of possibilities in the faint end from a steep slope , in the case of ouchi et al .",
    "2004a lf , to a flat slope with sawicki & thompson ( 2005 ) lf .",
    "our general model fits suggest a mass - dependent luminosity evolution scenario for central galaxies such that galaxies that are present in halos above @xmath123 m@xmath12 brighten by factor of 3 to 8 between now and @xmath23 .",
    "this suggests that the star formation rate , per given dark matter halo mass , was increasing to high redshifts from today .",
    "a conclusion similar to what we generally suggest here was also reached by dahlen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on the rest b - band lf constructed from goods data , and also by cooray ( 2005b ) based on lfs from deep2 ( willmer et al .",
