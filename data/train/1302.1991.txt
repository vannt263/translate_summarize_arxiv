    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures ( @xmath1 ) and/or chemical potentials ( @xmath0 ) , strongly interacting matter goes through a phase transition from colour insulating hadron gas ( hg ) phase to colour conducting quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase  @xcite .",
    "heavy ion collisions can provide a unique opportunity to study this qcd phase transition from hg to qgp .",
    "our endeavour in such studies is the search of a suitable equation of state ( eos ) for the description of both phases of strongly interacting matter .",
    "significant success has been gained in lattice calculations using qcd thermodynamics to provide a valid eos for qcd matter at zero baryon chemical potential but at large @xmath1 .",
    "however , the lattice methods are unreliable to describe the properties of matter at finite density of baryons .",
    "therefore , finding an eos for qcd matter valid at zero as well as non - zero chemical potential is a challenging problem . in this paper , we construct a hybrid model where a new excluded - volume model is proposed for hg description and a thermodynamically - consistent quasiparticle model is given for the qgp phase in predicting the properties of entire qcd matter .",
    "moreover , we use the hybrid model to get the qcd phase boundary , location of critical point ( cp ) and determine the order of the phase transition .",
    "the eos for qgp in our quasiparticle framework and the calculations regarding thermodynamical quantities like pressure , energy density , particle density etc . can be found in our earlier work  @xcite . in this model , we start with the definition of average energy density and average number density of particles and derive all other thermodynamical quantities from them in a consistent manner .",
    "the parameters used in the calculations are given there .",
    "recently we proposed a new excluded - volume model for the hot and dense hg  @xcite .",
    "the grand canonical partition function in our excluded volume model of hg can be explicitly given as follows :    @xmath3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the degeneracy factor of ith species of baryons,@xmath5 is the energy of the particle ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the eigenvolume assigned to each baryon of ith species and hence @xmath8 becomes the total occupied volume where @xmath9 represent the total number of jth baryons .",
    "with respect to temperature at @xmath10 and @xmath11 mev in our hybrid model .",
    "shaded portion represents the calculation of andronic et al .",
    "@xcite . ]     in our hybrid model .",
    "lattice data points at @xmath10 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]     mev as obtained in our hybrid model and compared with lattice results  @xcite .",
    "dash - tripple dotted curve shows the result of andronic et al .",
    "@xcite . ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we have plotted the results obtained for the trace anomaly factor @xmath12 in our hybrid model calculations using hg and qgp equations of state separately at @xmath10 .",
    "we further compare our results with the results obtained from a recent lattice calculation  @xcite .",
    "we notice that our results yield an excellent fit to the lattice data.in fig .",
    "2 , we show the variations of baryonic succeptibility normalized as @xmath13 with temperature at @xmath10 and compare our results with the lattice qcd results .",
    "our hybrid model results again compare well with the lattice data points . here again the curves , for @xmath13 obtained for hg and qgp phases are smoothly connected at around @xmath14 mev , which shows the presence of a cross - over transition between two phases . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the variations of square of speed of sound ( @xmath15 ) with respect to temperature at @xmath10 mev and again a comparison is given with the lattice qcd results .",
    "for @xmath10 , our results reproduces the lattice results very well .",
    "we have also shown separately the curve for @xmath15 obtained by andronic et .",
    "al . by using rgsg model for hg phase only  @xcite",
    "however , the features of the curve differ from the lattice data , although it also yields a minimum at around the same temperature .",
    "in this section we attempt to show the precise location and nature of cp existing on this phase boundary",
    ".     with respect to coordinates of various phase transition points on the @xmath16 phase boundary .",
    "we have used transition points from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "4 , we show what will happen to a quantity depicting the change in the entropy density from the phase transition at cp of the phase diagram .",
    "we define the normalized difference @xmath17 and demonstrate its variations with respect to the coordinates of the phase transition points lying at the deconfining phase boundary .",
    "we find that @xmath18 and positive along the deconfining phase boundary in the case of first order phase transition which supports the role of the presence of a nonvanishing latent heat in the phase transition from hg to qgp .",
    "however , we surprisingly notice that @xmath19 exactly at the cp and thus cp can be taken as a point where the first order phase boundary terminates and phase transition changes its order .",
    "thus above results give a firm indication that the order of phase transition changes at cp for the deconfining phase transition .",
    "we hope that our results will clarify the mist surrounding the understanding of the deconfining phase transition and the conjectured phase boundary .",
    "more importantly , we have formulated a phenomenological hybrid model which provides a realistic eos for the entire qcd matter and in the absence of a first - principle lattice qcd calculation especially at finite @xmath0 , it can be reliably used for deriving the information on the qcd phase boundary.@xcite .",
