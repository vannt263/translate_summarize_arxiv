    "we will now discuss the system at finite temperature .",
    "we will see that the winding - number fluctuations have important consequences for the behaviour of the system because the msos model governing these fluctuations has an apparent finite - temperature phase transition .",

    "to see this , we note that the critical value @xmath63 for the transition in the msos model ( [ svar ] ) depends on temperature . at high temperatures ,",

    "in other words , for a resistance in the region @xmath66 , the system will cross a roughening transition for the winding numbers as we increase the temperature .",
    "although this transition is probably an artefact of the variational treatment , we believe that it will manifest itself as a crossover phenomenon in the system .    more precisely , while there appears to be two correlation lengths in this formulation ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the small and large fluctuations respectively ) , there is only one true phase correlation length , @xmath69 .",
    "this should follow the shorter of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "so , the sos model does not give rise to a true divergence in observable quantities , since @xmath70 is finite at all finite temperatures .",
    "instead , the divergence will be cut off when @xmath68 becomes comparable to @xmath70 .",
    "more generally , we expect physical quantities , such as the conductivity , to depend on both temperature and the proximity of the resistance to the critical value , @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , in the smooth phase of the sos model ( to the right of the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) , the correlation length @xmath68 is finite for fluctuations of the winding numbers about a smooth background .",
    "this affects dynamic quantities such as the conductivity which should therefore depend on _ both _ @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    =    on the rough side of the sos line , we expect no long - range order in the winding number . the conductivity may not exhibit signs of superfluidity .",
    "in fact , it may appear metallic or even insulating , _ even at superfluid values of @xmath1 _ , as long as we are looking at temperatures above the temperature , @xmath73 , where we cross the sos transition line .",
    "the temperature scale for this sos crossover is given by @xmath44 .",
    "this can become very small close to the quantum critical point ( see eq .",
    "( [ jcritical ] ) ) or in strongly disordered systems .",
    "we see that the true critical behaviour of the superfluid - insulator transition is hard to access experimentally .",
    "this discussion warns us that , unless we work at extremely low temperatures , the critical behaviour of the system may not follow a simple one - parameter scaling scheme ( when @xmath1 is close to @xmath74 so that the system is to the left of the sos line in fig .",

    "we believe that this may be an important source of difficulties for the scaling analysis of experimental data , and may be responsible for the observation of an apparent metallic phase in some experiments@xcite .    to be cautious , we should stress that this result depends on the observation that @xmath60 ( see discussion below eq .",

    ", we will check that this is reasonable by considering higher - order fluctuations .",
    "we will see that the crossover effect mentioned above shows up as the breakdown of our hartree - like decoupling of the small and large phase fluctuations .",

    "on the other hand , we expect the quantity @xmath95 to have the same critical behaviour as the energy fluctuations  it diverges as we cross the line of sos critical points . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", this will not be a true divergence , but only a crossover .",
    "nevertheless , this means that this contribution from @xmath96 will be large if we cross the sos transition line as we raise the temperature in the superfluid phase .",

    "<S> it remains controversial whether these systems remain metallic down to zero temperature . </S>",

    "<S> we will use a variational treatment which , in principle , may describe superfluid , metallic and insulator phases at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss dissipation arising from normal resistance or vortex motion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , although there may be a direct si transition at zero temperature , finite - temperature crossover phenomena may give rise to apparently metallic behaviour in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that the two dissipation mechanisms affect the low - temperature behaviour on different sides of the si critical point . </S>"
