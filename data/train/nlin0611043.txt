    "one of the well discussed models in nonlinear dynamics is the modified emden type equation ( mee ) , also called the modified painlev - ince equation , @xmath3 where over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "this equation has received attention from both mathematicians and physicists for more than a century @xcite .",
    "for example , in the nineteenth century , painlev had studied this equation and identified general solution for two parametric choices , namely , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . the above differential equation ( [ eq01 ] )",
    "arises in a variety of mathematical problems such as univalued functions defined by second order differential equations @xcite and the riccati equation @xcite . on the other hand physicists",
    "have shown that this equation arises in different contexts : for example , it occurs in the study of equilibrium configurations of a spherical gas cloud acting under the mutual attraction of its molecules and subject to the laws of thermodynamics @xcite and in the modelling of the fusion of pellets @xcite .",
    "it also governs spherically symmetric expansion or collapse of a relativistically gravitating mass @xcite .",
    "this equation can also be thought of as a one - dimensional analogue @xcite of the boson ` gauge - theory ' equations introduced by yang and mills .",
    "apart from the above , for the past two decades or so the invariance and integrability properties of this equation alone have been studied in detail by a number of authors , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", the mee ( [ eq01 ] ) has been found to possess explicit general solution only for the following parametric choices , that is , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "while the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) can be integrated trivially , in the third case the equation is linearizable to a free particle equation and in the fourth case the general solution can be expressed in terms of weierstrass elliptic function @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq01 ] ) has also been noted to possess painlev property only for certain values of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that equation ( [ eq01 ] ) admits a two parameter lie point symmetry group for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while for the chioce @xmath9 the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) possesses eight - parameter lie point symmetries @xcite",
    ". however , the general solution for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) with @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary is yet to be explored .",
    "very recently @xcite , the present authors have studied a generalized version of this equation from a different perspective and shown that the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) , for @xmath10 , possesses time independent integrals and admits a hamiltonian formalism which in turn ensures its complete integrability @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complicated form of the first integral the general solution was not obtained in the previous work . keeping in mind the historical importance and popularity of this model we kept exploring the general solution of equation ( [ eq01 ] ) in phase - space .",
    "based on our investigation , in this paper , we construct the time independent integrals for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( including the case @xmath11 ) .",
    "since the first integrals are not in simple polynomial forms it is difficult to obtain the general solution by just directly integrating them . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "first we identify time independent hamiltonians from these time independent integrals and making use of suitable canonical transformations we convert the hamiltonians into standard forms .",
    "we then integrate the new hamiltonians and obtain the general solutions or reduce to quadratures . in this way we report the general solution for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the first time . our motivation to explore this solution is , as we see below , also due to the fact that the mee ( [ eq01 ] ) is not a stand - alone model .",
    "it is intimately connected to force - free duffing oscillator type equation ( vide equation ( [ eq08 ] ) below ) and two dimensional lotka - volterra ( lv ) equation ( vide equation ( [ eq10 ] ) below ) . the popularity and importance of these two models need no emphasis @xcite . thus exploring the general solution for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) also serves to establish the complete integrability of these two models for appropriate parameters besides understanding the dynamics of the other models mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we give the time independent integrals and corresponting hamiltonians for the mee ( [ eq01 ] ) . using suitable canonical transformations",
    ", we obtain the general solutions for the parameter ranges @xmath12 and @xmath13 separately in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we show that the mee ( [ eq01 ] ) is intimately connected with two other well known nonlinear models , namely , the force - free duffing oscillator type equation and two dimensional lotka - volterra equation .",
    "finally , in section [ sec5 ] we summarize our results .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the mee ( [ eq01 ] ) can not be straightforwardly integrated . making use of the modified prelle - singer method developed by us recently @xcite following the earlier work of duarte et al @xcite , in this section we first identify the first integrals separately for each of the three ranges ( i ) @xmath14 , ( ii ) @xmath15 and ( iii ) @xmath13 .",
    "then we identify suitable canonical hamiltonian description for each of these cases .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time independent integrals for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) with @xmath10 has been reported using the modified prelle - singer procedure .",
    "however , improving the ansatz given in ref .",
    "@xcite one can obtain the time independent integrals for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the method of deriving the integrals for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) with @xmath1 and @xmath2 arbitrary is given in appendix a. using this method we identify the following time independent first integrals for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) with @xmath1 and @xmath2 arbitrary , that is , @xmath16 , & \\label { intm01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the trivial cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , and so they are not considered here separately .    as it is very difficult to integrate equations ( [ intm03])-([intm01 ] ) and",
    "obtain the general solutions by direct integration , we correlate these integrals with appropriate hamiltonians . in the following",
    "we briefly give the method of obtain the hamiltonian from the known time independent integral .",
    "to explore the hamiltonian description of ( [ intm03 ] ) , let us assume the existence of a hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lagrangian and @xmath24 is the canonically conjugate momentum .",
    "then @xmath25 from ( [ mlin13a ] ) we identify @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an arbitrary function of @xmath28 and the lagrangian @xmath29 . here , without loss of generality",
    ", we take @xmath30 . substituting the integrals ( [ intm03])-([intm01 ] ) into ( [ mlin13b ] ) and integrating the resultant integrals we can obtain the expression for the canonical momentum @xmath24 . substituting back the latter into the equation  ( [ mlin13 ] ) and simplifying the resultant equation we arrive at the following lagrangian , @xmath31 ( \\frac{4\\dot{x}}{x})-\\alpha tan^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{\\alpha \\dot{x}+2\\beta x^2 } { \\omega \\dot{x}}\\bigg]\\bigg)\\\\ \\qquad \\qquad -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\dot{x}^2+\\alpha x^2\\dot{x}+\\beta x^4 ) , & \\;\\;\\;\\alpha^2 <",

    "in this section , we consider each of the above three cases separately , namely , ( i ) @xmath14 , ( ii ) @xmath15 and ( iii ) @xmath13 , and obtain their respective general solutions using suitable canonical transformations .      to derive the general solution for this parametric choice first we consider the hamiltonian given in ( [ mlin16 ] ) for @xmath34 as @xmath35 introducing the canonical transformation @xmath36 the hamiltonian ( [ eq04 ] ) can be recast into the standard form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant . from the corresponding canonical equations @xmath39 , equation ( [ eq06a ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath40 rewriting the above equation we get @xmath41 integrating the equation ( [ eq06b ] ) we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the second arbitrary integration constant and _ erf _ is the error function @xcite .    substituting the equation ( [ eq07a ] ) into equation ( [ eq05 ] ) we get the general solution for the equation ( [ eq01 ] ) , with the parametric choice @xmath45 , in the form ( after some modifications ) @xmath46 in fig . 1",
    ", we have plotted the solution of mee ( [ eq01 ] ) given by the expression ( [ eq07 ] ) for the parametric choice @xmath34 for different initial conditions .     for different initial conditions .",
    "]      now let us consider the hamiltonian for the case @xmath47 from ( [ mlin16 ] ) , that is , @xmath48    interestingly , here we identify a canonical transformation for the hamiltonian ( [ com03 ] ) in the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that when @xmath51 and @xmath52 are canonical so do @xmath28 and @xmath24 ( and vice versa ) so that the hamiltonian @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ com03 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from the canonical equations",
    "then we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    to obtain the general solution",
    ", we introduce a transformation @xmath59 in equation ( [ com06 ] ) so that the latter can be brought to a quadrature of the form @xmath60 now fixing @xmath61 , the above integral leads us to the following expression @xcite , that is , @xmath62 on the other hand fixing @xmath63 in ( [ int01 ] ) , we end up with the following expression @xcite @xmath64    for integer values of @xmath65 the integrals ( [ int02 ] ) and ( [ int03 ] ) can be integrated explicitly by repeated use of these formulas .",
    "when @xmath65 is a noninteger value the final term in the integrals ( [ int02 ] ) and ( [ int03 ] ) can be integrated in terms of logarithmic function or beta function @xcite ( since the value of @xmath66 in the final integral lies between 0 to 1 ) .",

    "in this section , we show that the mee ( [ eq01 ] ) is intimately connected with two other well known nonlinear models , namely , the force - free duffing oscillator type equation and two dimensional lotka - volterra ( lv ) equation .      the mee equation ( [ eq01 ] ) can be transformed to the following oscillator equation @xmath86 through the invertible point transformation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "equation ( [ eq08 ] ) includes force - free duffing oscillator ( in the specific case @xmath20 ) @xcite and quadratic oscillator with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "one can deduce the general solution of the equation ( [ eq08 ] ) from the general solution of mee .",
    "for example , in the parametric choice @xmath45 the general solution of the equation ( [ eq08 ] ) can be derived from ( [ eq07 ] ) in the form @xmath89 where now @xmath90 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are arbitrary integration constants .",

    "finally , we mention that the general solution for the equation ( [ eq12 ] ) for other parametric choices can be obtained from equation ( [ eq08 ] ) in a similar manner . again ( to our knowledge ) the complete integrability of the lv system ( [ eq13 ] ) in these regimes is new to the literature .",

    "we have transformed the hamiltonians into simpler forms , with appropriate canonical transformations , and deduced the general solution by direct integration so that our approach helps to understand the dynamics of equation ( [ eq01 ] ) in phase - space clearly .",
    "further , we have demonstrated that the complete integrability of equation ( [ eq01 ] ) also helps one to understand the dynamics of two other nonlinear models , namely , the generalized oscillator equation and the two dimensional lv equation . as a consequence",
