    "astrophysical and cosmological observations clearly indicate that the universe has entered into a period of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3cdm model accounts for these observations by requiring two new energy densities : a dark matter ( dm ) component , characterized by a small temperature , interacting only gravitationally with the other energy components and a cosmological constant @xmath3 , equivalent to a perfect fluid with negative pressure : @xmath4 with an equation of state parameter @xmath5 .",
    "to explain the current period of accelerated expansion only @xmath6 is required .",
    "this negative pressure fluid is named dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the current values of the energy densities are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in units of the critical density , and of the equation of state parameter @xmath9 , compatible with a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "although the effects of dm and de on large scale are very well constrained , the lack of evidence of counterparts at the particle level has been interpreted as a break on general relativity ( gr ) at galactic , extragalactic and cosmological scales and alternative models to gr have been proposed .    generically , extended theories of gravity ( etgs ) generalize the hilbert - einstein lagrangian by including higher - order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled terms between scalar fields and geometry .",
    "the most studied generalization consists in replacing the ricci scalar @xmath10 in the hilbert - einstein action with a more general function of the curvature @xmath0 ( for comprehensive reviews see @xcite ) . although many @xmath0 models can be tested with astrophysical and cosmological observations ( see @xcite and reference therein ) , the exact functional form of the gravitational action is still unknown .",
    "the higher order terms appearing in the lagrangian can be recast as additional scalar fields by performing a conformal transformation from the jordan to the einstein frame @xcite . as an example",
    ", chameleon @xmath0 models introduce a scalar field non - minimally coupled to matter , giving rise to the so called fifth force .",
    "these models require a screening mechanism to erase the effect of the scalar field in high density environments to evade the constraints imposed by the solar system dynamics @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to test these models from astrophysical to cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "for instance , an upper bound on the background amplitude of the chameleon field has been found by studying the gravitational interaction on the outskirts of galaxy clusters @xcite . at the scale of cluster of galaxies",
    ", @xcite demonstrated the existence of a degeneracy between the baryonic processes and the underlying theory of gravity .",
    "although it is always possible to transform the model from the jordan to the einstein frame and vice - versa since they are conformally equivalent , nothing can be said _ a priori _ about their physically equivalence that must be studied for each specific case @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could make the whole analysis in the jordan frame and consider the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the theory of gravity as `` free parameters '' that must be constrained using data .",
    "thus , those parameters are expected to acquire different values at different scales in order to pass the solar system constraints .",
    "for instance , analytic @xmath0 models , those expandable in taylor series around a fixed point @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 give rise to yukawa - like corrections of the gravitational potential in the newtonian limit @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 quantifies the deviation from gr at zero order and @xmath15 is an extra gravitational scale length of the self - gravitating object @xcite . this new gravitational scale is strictly related to the theory : @xmath0 gravity is a fourth - order theory and its extra degrees of freedom give rise , in the weak field limit , to a new characteristic scale length ( see @xcite for the description of the general paradigm on @xmath16-order theories of gravity ) .",

    "analytic @xmath0 models provide a good fit to the mass profile of 12 x - ray clusters without requiring a dm halo @xcite .",

    "was determined using a reconstructed map of cmb temperature fluctuations , and computing sz profiles averaged over a sample of 579 galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "this led to the bounds @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the sz profiles of clusters agree with the observed profiles when their intra cluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential in eq .  .",
    "there is no need to introduce a dominant dm component .",
    "we particularize our analysis for the coma cluster since is located close to the galactic pole where the foreground emission is comparatively low .",
    "we use _ planck _ 2013 nominal maps to measure its sz profile and constrain the parameters @xmath21 of the modified gravitational potential .",

    "our purpose is to test a class of theories of gravity that in the weak field limit gives rise to a yukawa - like correction of the newtonian gravitational potential .",

    "the post - newtonian limit in a higher order theory of gravity introduces correction terms in the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "the correcting terms depends on the order of the partial differential equations that describe the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xmath25 the field equations are fourth order and in the post - newtonian limit there is a yukawa - like correction term that modifies the newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "this correction also appears in any @xmath0-model that can be expanded in taylor series . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us briefly derive the solution of the field equations in the weak field limit for a spherically symmetric matter distribution ( a detailed description of the weak field limit in gr can be found in @xcite , while its analogue in @xmath0-gravity was studied in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the metric can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the solid angle . in order to study the weak field limit ,",
    "the metric tensor can be written as follows @xcite @xmath28 these expansions are introduced into the field equations to compute the perturbations at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . particularizing eq . for an analytic @xmath0 model at order zero",

    "can be rewritten as the modified potential of eq . .",
    "the general result of eq .",
    "implies that the newtonian potential describes the gravitational interaction only in the particular case of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 . in other words ,",
    "the parameters of the yukawa - like correction , @xmath21 , represent the deviation of the gravitational potential from the standard newtonian gravity .",
    "as it is well known , any high order theory of gravity has to evade the solar system constraints .",
    "specifically , at small scales ( @xmath58 ) the yukawa term in the gravitational potential is not in contradiction with solar system observations @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , apart of a possible inadequacy in comparing results from the two frames , one can re - write any @xmath0 model as a scalar - tensor theory plus a scalar field ( @xmath61 ) . then",
    ", in the small scale limit the mass of the scalar field , given by @xmath62 , diverges @xcite .",
    "this divergence corresponds to the well - known chameleon mechanism which requires the scalar field to be suppressed ( at small scales ) in high density environments @xcite . at large scales ,",
    "the values @xmath63 and @xmath64 generate deviations from newtonian gravity , open the possibility to observationally confirm or rule out these alternative theories of gravity .",
    "modifications of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian have an effect at all scales . as indicated",
    "such modifications have to evade the well established solar system constraints . at galaxy",
    "scales the corrections to the newtonian gravitational potential can describe systems like spiral and elliptical galaxies , and galaxy clusters without resorting to dm .",
    "detailed analysis at galaxy scales have been carried out @xcite , there is not a definitive answer on whether the assumptions on the underlying theory of gravity are correct or not .",
    "our purpose is to test such theories using clusters of galaxies , the largest virialized objects in the universe , to test modified models of gravity at scales intermediate between galactic and cosmological scales .",
    "let us also remark that in the limit @xmath65 the gravitational potential is that of a point - like mass @xmath66 . in this limit ,",
    "the dynamics is newtonian and to explain the structure of self - gravitating systems and the evolution of large scale structure , dm needs to be introduced as in the standard cosmological model .",
    "cluster of galaxies are the largest virialized objects in the universe .",
    "their intra - cluster medium ( icm ) reaches temperatures in the range @xmath67kev .",
    "when cmb photons cross the potential wells of clusters , they gain energy via inverse compton scattering with the hot electrons of the icm .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies generated by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz ) have two components : the thermal sz effect ( tsz , @xcite ) due to the thermal motion of the icm medium and the kinematic sz effect ( ksz , @xcite ) due to the proper motion of the cluster with respect to the isotropic cmb frame .",
    "the tsz is usually expressed in terms of the comptonization parameter @xmath68 as @xmath69 in this expression @xmath70 is the current value of the cmb black - body temperature @xmath71k @xcite , @xmath72 is the spectral dependence of the tsz effect , @xmath73 the thomson cross section , @xmath74 the electron mass , @xmath75 the speed of light and @xmath76 the boltzmann constant . the pressure profile along the line of sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "@xmath77 is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the electron density and electron temperature , respectively .",
    "in _ the _ non relativistic limit ( @xmath81 few kev ) , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the reduced frequency . to improve the description of the tsz effect , we included relativistic corrections in the electron temperature up to fourth order ( @xcite ) .    to compute the pressure profile of eq .",

    "we consider the analytic @xmath0 model given by eq .",
    ", and the modified gravitational potential of eq .",

    "the resulting profile will be integrated along the l.o.s . and convolved with the antenna beam of the different _ planck _ channels to predict the tsz temperature fluctuations .",
    "we use the _ planck _ 2013 nominal maps to measure the tsz temperature anisotropies induced by the coma cluster . _",
    "planck _ maps were originally released in a healpix format with resolution @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the nearby coma cluster is one of the best studied clusters of galaxies because of its richness , degree of symmetry and location near the galactic pole .",

    "therefore , we will restrict our analysis to this intermediate region .      _",
    "planck _ nominal maps were released in 2013 .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic cmb temperature anisotropies , sz effect and instrumental noise , they contain foreground emissions from galactic dust , co lines , synchrotron radiation and point and extended infrared sources .",
    "the tsz effect has a unique dependence with frequency and it can be reliably distinguished from other components using adequate techniques to reduced foreground contamination and the cosmological cmb signal ( our cleaning procedure is extensively described in @xcite ) .",
    "we will analyze only the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) data .",
    "this instrument operates at frequencies 100 - 857 ghz , with angular resolutions @xmath100 arcminutes .",
    "it has better angular resolution and lower instrument noise than the low frequency instrument ( 30 - 70 ghz ) .",
    "we will measure the tsz cluster profile at 100 , 143 , and 353 ghz channels , since after cleaning the data at 545 ghz is still dominated by residual foreground emission . in those channels ,",
    "coma pressure profile has been measured from 5 to 100 arcminutes . at 217 ghz",
    "the tsz is greatly reduced and provides no relevant information .",
    "the details on _ planck _ data processing are deferred to app .",

    "to constraint extended theories of gravity using the pressure profile of the coma cluster , we first measure the average tsz emission ( @xmath101 ) over disc / rings out to @xmath102 arcminutes from center of the coma cluster ( see app .",

    "when computing the likelihood we neglect the error on the cmb blackbody temperature @xmath70 and the uncertainty on the angular scale that corresponds to each data point since they are both negligible with respect to the error on the tsz temperature anisotropies .",

    "the step size is adapted in order to reach an optimal acceptance rate between 20% and 50% @xcite .",
    "if the step size is too small the acceptance rate will be too high ( @xmath111 ) resulting in poor mixing and if the step is too large then the acceptance rate will be small ( @xmath112 ) and the chain will converge slowly .",

    "this limit corresponds to a newtonian gravitational potential generated by a mass @xmath116 .",
    "since the data favors models with @xmath117 , @xmath118 is analogue to the field generated by a cluster that contains a large fraction of dm distributed like the baryonic gas . to conclude , _ to explain the pressure profile of the coma cluster , either dm or a modified theory of gravity is required .",

    "the plot shows a slight departure from the model in the outskirt of the cluster , specially evident at 353 ghz . since",
    "our clean patches are generated centered on the cluster , the outer parts of the cluster profile is the region most affected by foreground residuals .",
    "this is particularly true at 353 ghz where we estimate a residual of @xmath123k compared with @xmath124k at the other two frequencies .",
    "however , this departure could be due to physical reasons such as the gas not being in hydrostatic equilibrium , departures from spherical symmetry and the presence of substructure . in order to study the impact of such phenomena",
    "one should include a non - thermal term in the pressure .",
    "for that , either n - body simulations of each specific @xmath0 model or a scaling relation to estimate such non - thermal component are needed .",
    "since the latter has been achieved using hydrodynamical n - body simulations in @xmath3cdm , its use could bias the results forcing the model to mimic the dm in the outskirt masking any effect due to the modified theory of gravity .",
    "finally , it has been shown in @xcite that such contributions are negligible when , as in this work , the analysis is restricted to the intermediate regions of the cluster .",
    "the resolution of our foreground clean maps is 10 arcminutes and the data do not probe the innermost region where shock heating , turbulence , cooling flows and other physical processes can deviate the dynamical state of the gas from hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "the theory of gravity using data from the cluster core would require a good understanding of the physical phenomena to separate the physical effects associated with the dynamical state of the gas from those associated with the modified theory of gravity and an extensive study with numerical hydro - codes would be needed to compute the pressure profile . in any case , the next - generation of full sky cmb missions such as core / prism @xcite will resolve the core , opening to the possibility to properly study the coupling / degeneracies between the underlying theory of gravity and the baryonic processes .",

    "the correctness of these hypotheses can only be tested using hydrodynamical simulations . however",
    "since etgs have extra degrees of freedom compared to gr , each specific lagrangian would require its own set of simulations .",

    "<S> we show that the computed @xmath0 pressure profile fits the data giving rise to competitive constraints of the yukawa scale length @xmath1 , and of the deviation parameter @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> those are currently the tightest constraints at galaxy cluster scale , and support the idea that extended theories of gravity provide an alternative explanation to the dynamics of self - gravitating systems without requiring dark matter . </S>"
