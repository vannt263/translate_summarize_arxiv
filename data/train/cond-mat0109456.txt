    "ideal trees , either regular or random , play a great role in the description of natural phenomena : many systems , from rivers  @xcite to blood vessels and lungs  @xcite , to real trees can be described by geometrical branched structures .",
    "other phenomena can be described by branched structures in time ( _ i.e. _ branching processes ) , with cascades of events generating new events in a multiplicative fashion : examples span from physics ( _ e.g. _ nuclear chain reactions and directed percolation )  @xcite , to biology ( speciation )  @xcite and many others disciplines .",
    "more recently , trees ( and branching processes ) have been used to model the mean - field approximation of many non - equilibrium , self - organized critical systems such as the bak - tang - wiesenfeld sandpile and the bak - sneppen model  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these models has a branching structure , where some local events can trigger more events of the same kind , with some rules given by the branching probability distribution ( _ i.e. _ the probability @xmath6 to trigger @xmath7 new events ) and by the geometric constraints induced by the finite spatial dimension @xmath8 ( that is , different branches can interact when coming to the same region ) . to model branching processes in infinite dimension ( mean - field )",
    "the usual assumption is that there are no interactions between different branches : the statistical properties of branching , @xmath6 , are preserved , but any spatial constraints are lost . in particular , the mean - field limit of the above",
    "mentioned _ critical _ models is recovered considering _ critical _ branching processes  @xcite .",
    "a critical branching process is characterized by an average branching ratio @xmath9 , so that every generation of branching is ( on the average ) identical to the preceding ones . what people are usually interested in is the probability distribution @xmath0 of the tree sizes @xmath1 , that is , the number of sites ( or of branching events , in a branching process jargon ) making up the trees .",
    "it is a well - known result of branching process theory that @xmath10 for critical trees  @xcite .",
    "this power - law behavior is consistent with the assumption of criticality , as common wisdom suggests .",
    "interestingly enough , much less is known about the size distribution of supercritical trees . in this paper",
    "we show , through simulations and analytical arguments , that also the supercritical case ( @xmath11 ) exhibits a power - law distribution of tree sizes @xmath12 .",
    "some connections of this result to the structure of the internet and to taxonomic systems are proposed .",
    "starting from a root site ( generation @xmath13 ) , a random tree is grown letting every site at generation @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) branch into @xmath7 new sites ( generation @xmath16 ) with probability @xmath6 .",
    "an example of a random tree is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we are interested in the size distribution of the subtrees : picking a site at random on the tree , what is the probability @xmath0 that the subtree that is rooted on it has size @xmath1 ? in fig.[fig1 ] such sizes are also marked for every site .",
    "sites at generation @xmath17 are assigned a size @xmath18 ( just themselves ) .",
    "we have performed simulations for different choices of @xmath6 , both with @xmath2 , finding the known result @xmath10 and with @xmath11 , finding @xmath12 , as announced above ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .    to get an analytical insight in the origin of this behavior",
    ", we must decompose @xmath0 in generation dependent probabilities @xmath19 ( @xmath20 if @xmath21 since trees are grown up to @xmath17 ) .",
    "we write explicitly the way in which generation dependent quantities sum up to give the tree distribution @xmath0 : @xmath22 in ( [ distribution ] ) @xmath23 is the number of sites at generation @xmath14 that are roots of a subtree of size @xmath1 , @xmath24 is the total number of sites at generation @xmath14 , @xmath25 is the total number of sites on the tree . @xmath26",
    "indicates the average over many realization of the system .",
    "indeed , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 change from realization to realization . as a first approximation",
    "we assume that , over many realizations , the generation dependent quantities converge to their average values : @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    ". then we can write @xmath29 where the last equality holds in the limit of large @xmath17 .",
    "we checked the reliability of such approximation , simulating the same process on regularly growing lattices .",
    "starting at generation @xmath13 with @xmath30 sites , then @xmath31 ( approximating it to the closest integer ) .",
    "then each site at generation @xmath32 is assigned to an ancestor in generation @xmath14 .",
    "the branching distribution is then the binomial @xmath33 that in the limit @xmath34 becomes the poisson distribution @xmath35 , independent from @xmath14 .",
    "this process gives the same results as the simulation of the genuine random trees , that is @xmath36 if @xmath2 , @xmath12 if @xmath4 , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "problem ( [ new distribution ] ) can be formally solved using the recursion relation for the generating functions of @xmath19 .",
    "indeed we can write a relation between the probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath37 : @xmath38    we define the generating functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 . then , multiplying both sides of ( [ recursion in k ] ) by @xmath41 and summing over @xmath1 , we obtain a recursion relation for the generating functions at successive generations @xmath42 \\label{recursion in z}\\ ] ] that is a very well known result from branching process theory  @xcite .",
    "( [ recursion in z ] ) can be formally solved using the `` initial condition '' @xmath43 that translates into @xmath44 .",
    "then we can iterate eq.[recursion in z ] back to generation @xmath13 to have an explicit expression of every @xmath45 , and , from ( [ new distribution ] ) obtain the generating function @xmath46 .",
    "knowing @xmath47 we could , in principle , get the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0 : if @xmath48 for large @xmath1 , then @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "unfortunately , if @xmath12 , then we could expect a non - analytic behavior @xmath51 , that can not be obtained from an expansion of @xmath47 for @xmath50 .",
    "instead , we should expand around @xmath52 , and resum the terms power - by - power of @xmath53 , which entails to computing explicitly @xmath0 directly from ( [ new distribution ] ) .",
    "such an observation is of some relevance since in the critical case @xmath2 , invoking the time - translational invariance of the process ( that is , setting @xmath54 so that @xmath55 ) , eq.[recursion in z ] becomes @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "expanding both hands for @xmath50 and using the corresponding form @xmath57 , one can find that to match all the powers of @xmath58 on both sides the only choice is @xmath59 . some simple cases for which @xmath56 $ ] can be solved exactly are given by the branching probabilities @xmath60 if @xmath61 , with @xmath62 . in these cases",
    "the recursion equation reduces to a second order equation in @xmath47 , that can be readily solved to explicitely show that the leading non - analytic behavior for @xmath50 is given by @xmath63 , hence @xmath10 .    still , even when the system is supercritical , the generating function formulation is not fruitless .",
    "indeed it is possible to use it to compute the average subtree size @xmath64 . given the generating function @xmath47 it is easy to see that the average size is @xmath65_{z=1 } = ( m-1 ) \\sum_{t=0}^{t_{max } } m^{-(t_{max}-t+1 ) } g_t'(1)\\;\\;\\;. \\label{average value}\\ ] ] taking the derivative of ( [ recursion in z ] ) we obtain a recursion relation for @xmath66 , @xmath67 with the `` initial '' condition @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 from which we finally get @xmath70    we find therefore that the average value @xmath71 diverges as @xmath72 , a clear indication of a power - law behavior .",
    "yet , it diverges as the logarithm of the maximal allowed size , that is @xmath73 , which is the average total number of sites on the tree .",
    "this is already a strong indication that asymptotically @xmath74 .",
    "we then look at the behavior of @xmath19 from simulations .",
    "we plot in fig.[fig3 ] the generation probabilities @xmath19 at generations @xmath75 ( trees are grown for @xmath76 generations , with @xmath77 ) .",
    "they clearly decay exponentially for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "such an exponential decay is suggestive of the presence of a size @xmath78 characteristic of each generation .",
    "there is a simple and intuitive relation between @xmath19 and @xmath37 , namely , @xmath79 the relation between the arguments is readily understood thinking that , on the average , a site at generation @xmath14 is the root of a subtree of size @xmath80 only if each of its @xmath81 descendents at generation @xmath16 is the root of a subtree of size @xmath1 ( and formally it is expressed by eq.[mean recursion ] ) .",
    "the prefactor @xmath81 is due to normalization .",
    "interestingly , ( [ scaling recursion ] ) is the generalization to the supercritical case of the time - translational invariance assumed to hold in the critical case @xmath2 .",
    "relation ( [ scaling recursion ] ) is numerically verified , for @xmath82 , where the asymptotic behavior has been reached , as shown in the inset of fig.[fig3 ] .    using ( [ scaling recursion ] ) it is at",
    "last possible to have further evidence that @xmath12 asymptotically .",
    "we write @xmath83 where we have used @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "the final equality is consistent with a power - law decay with exponent @xmath84 for large @xmath1 .    to give further support to the idea that a functional form of @xmath19 that satisfies ( [ scaling recursion ] ) generically implies inverse square decay , we assume the form @xmath85 with @xmath86 , that obeys ( [ scaling recursion ] )",
    ". then @xmath87    the second sum on the _ r.h.s _ of ( [ forma ] ) is @xmath88 going from sums to integrals we write @xmath89 where we posed @xmath90 , such that , in the limit of large @xmath14 , @xmath91 and the switch from sums to integrals is justified .",
    "moreover , the upper limit of integration , @xmath18 , comes after taking the limit @xmath72 . after applying the same approximation on the first sum on the _",
    "r.h.s _ of ( [ forma ] ) , eventually we have @xmath92 for large values of @xmath1 .    a derivation of analogous results has been given in @xcite for trees with a fixed branching ratio .",
    "such a derivation based on the mellin transform , although extremely instructive , can not be extended directly to variable branching ratios and in particular for a non zero death probability .",
    "we have studied the size distribution @xmath0 of random trees and subtrees . alongside with the well known result @xmath10 for the case of critical trees ( unitary branching ratio ) , we have found that also supercritical trees show a power - law behavior @xmath12 .",
    "some occurences of this behavior have already been found .    in taxonomy",
    "@xcite , it has been found that the distribution of taxa according to the number of their subtaxa has a power - law behavior , with exponents scattered around @xmath93 .",
    "since taxonomy is intrinsically related to a branch tree organization of genera , families , species etc . , it is suggestive to think that such exponents could be related to the tree - like nature of the system itself , rather than to some underlying dynamical critical process .",
    "even more recently it has been pointed out that such a power - law behavior is present also for trees generated by connections on the internet  @xcite : there each node of the tree is a site on the internet , and the branches correspond to the sites it is linked to ( actually the structure of the internet is that of a network , but search and trace programs superimpose to it a corresponding tree structure ) .",
    "the number of sites on the internet that collect an area ( number of sites ) @xmath1 scales as @xmath94 with @xmath53 close to @xmath93 . using this result we can infer that the internet , when looked at as a tree , is exponentially growing .      from a more general viewpoint ,",
    "the emergence of `` criticality '' in such a simple and well known framework as supercritical trees is suggestive of a whole new family of systems ( webs and supercritical webs ) still hiding interesting properties .",
    "some preliminary simulations for directed webs show that this seems to be the case ."
