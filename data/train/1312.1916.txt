    "a digital camera on a modern ground - based astronomical telescope will count a fraction of the photons produced by a celestial source that reach the top of the atmosphere . for broad - band observations",
    "the digital count ( adu ) associated with a source is proportional to the integral of the optical flux @xmath3 from the source weighted by the observational bandpass , @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the area of the telescope pupil and @xmath7 is the duration of the exposure .",
    "the units of flux @xmath8 are ergs @xmath9 s@xmath10 hz@xmath10 , and the factor @xmath11 counts the number of photons per unit energy at a given wavelength .",
    "( strictly , this should be @xmath12 , but the units can be chosen to absorb the factor of planck s constant @xmath13 into the definition of the instrumental system response . ) the coordinates @xmath14 are those of the source image in the focal plane of the camera , @xmath15 are the altitude and azimuth of the telescope pointing , and @xmath16 is the time ( and date ) of the observation .    assuming the atmospheric and instrumental properties are uncorrelated , the optical passband can be separated into two functions , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the optical transmittance ( dimensionless ) from the top of the atmosphere to the input pupil of the telescope , and @xmath19 is the instrumental system response ( adu / photon ) from photons through the input pupil of the telescope to adu counts in the camera .",
    "this instrumental `` throughput '' includes the reflectance of the mirrors , transmission of the refractive optics and optical filters , efficiency of the camera sensors , and the gain of the electronics used to read out the detectors . the relative spatial variation in @xmath19 is usually measured with some combination of artificial illumination with diffuse light from a screen mounted in the dome of the telescope housing and star flats assembled from dithered exposures of fields with high densities of stars @xcite .",
    "if care is taken to manage effects of thermal and mechanical changes of the telescope , then it is possible to obtain a relatively stable instrumental response throughout a night of observing .",
    "careful analysis can reduce errors in the flat fielding across small fields of view to sub - percent accuracies @xcite .",
    "but the atmospheric transmittance can vary considerably more rapidly and by significantly greater amounts @xcite .",
    "precise photometry is traditionally achieved only during times when atmospheric conditions are stable and clear of clouds . a night",
    "is generally regarded as `` photometric '' if multiple observations of the same target yield sufficiently small variations in measured magnitudes . only at the best sites",
    "do these conditions exist for significant fractions of the observing calendar .",
    "the science goals for future ground - based all - sky surveys , such as the dark energy survey ( des ) @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite , and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite pose stringent requirements on the stability and uniformity of photometric measurements .",
    "these surveys seek relative calibration of photometry that is stable in time and uniform over the sky to precisions of a per cent or better .",
    "this performance will need to be achieved with measurements made from multiple images taken over the course of many years . and to maximize efficiency , these surveys will observe in less than ideal conditions . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate a method to precisely calibrate data taken in non - photometric conditions .",
    "processes that attenuate light as it propagates through the atmosphere include absorption and scattering ( rayleigh ) by molecular constituents ( o@xmath20 , o@xmath21 , water vapor , and trace elements ) , scattering ( mie ) by airborne macroscopic particulate aerosols with physical dimensions comparable to the wavelength of visible light , and shadowing by ice crystals and water droplets in clouds .",
    "these process all have characteristic dependences on wavelength and airmass , and atmospheric transmittance can be separated into three terms , @xmath22    in a previous paper @xcite we reported a technique to remove effects of attenuation by atmospheric molecules and aerosols in calibration of ground - based observations at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the technique reported there takes advantage of state - of - the - art models of atmospheric optical radiation transport and readily - available codes to accurately compute atmospheric extinction over a wide range of observing conditions .",
    "spectra of a small catalog of bright `` probe '' stars are taken as they progress across the sky and back - light the atmosphere during the night .",
    "the signatures of various atmospheric constituents in these spectra are used to extract the makeup of the atmosphere across the sky .",
    "this technique was shown to provide excellent reconstruction of the wavelength - dependent portion of atmospheric transmission .",
    "in addition to determination of the wavelength - dependent atmospheric extinction , calibration of wide - field imaging survey data requires recognition and correction for absorption and scattering of light by water droplets and ice crystals in clouds .",
    "these particulates are large compared to the wavelength of visible light , so they produce shadows that are wavelength independent ( @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : sgray ] ) .",
    "cloud structure can be intricate with significant spatial variations across a single field of view , and can change in the time interval between exposures @xcite . in the worst case , the loss of light will be too severe to allow useful data to be taken .",
    "but it will be important to be able to correct data for thin cloud cover that may not be apparent to the naked eye , and it will certainly be of great benefit to be able to take useful data over an extended range of atmospheric conditions .",
    "there are several important features of future dedicated surveys that should enable this to be done .",
    "these surveys will use telescopes with fields of view several degrees across , and they will be sensitive enough to capture several tens of thousands of stars in each image .",
    "these surveys also will observe these stars multiple times , and so will be sensitive to changes in observing conditions .      here",
    "we extend our previous work to include photometric corrections for cloud cover .",
    "we seek a calibration of each image in a data set relative to a reference condition of the sky encountered during the survey .",
    "this reference condition may be the most photometric night , but it need not be ; it could be a frequently encountered condition that optimizes statistical sampling of celestial objects .",
    "absolute calibration of this reference condition is a later step .",
    "our goal is a robust calibration procedure that will achieve highly reproducible results from survey data taken over a wide range of conditions rather than optimum results from tightly selected subsamples of the data .",
    "our strategy is to construct a catalog of stars that appear as point - sources in the survey images themselves . the number of such sources , and the precision with which their magnitudes are measured , must be sufficient to create an accurate ( up to an overall constant ) map @xmath24 of the gray extinction at all points on each image . the required density and precision of measurements of calibration sources is determined by the spatial structure of the absorption of light by cloud cover and the photometric requirements of the survey .",
    "the goal of this study is to provide a more quantitative picture of these conditions and requirements .",
    "the calibration procedure begins with a standard photometric reduction of images carried out using bias , dark , and flat - field images taken on a nightly cadence .",
    "the technique discussed in our previous paper is used to determine wavelength - dependent atmospheric extinction for each image ; and the observed instrumental magnitudes of sources on each image are corrected to the top of the atmosphere with the assumption that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xmath25 of the object is independent of wavelength ( _ i.e. _ `` flat '' ) .",
    "an internal standard magnitude system is defined , and linear color corrections are then applied to transform the flat sed magnitudes to in - band top - of - the - atmosphere magnitudes .",
    "the final step is a global calibration analysis based on the successful sdss bercal technique @xcite .",
    "this analysis determines the wavelength - independent extinction for every image in the survey sample , and completes the definition of the internal calibration .",
    "this paper discusses each of these in the context of analysis of data acquired during an observing run that we carried out at cerro tololo in northern chile .",
    "an observing campaign was done for this study during a 3-night period in july 2009 at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) in northern chile .",
    "data were taken on each night with the smarts 1.5 m cassegrain telescope with the ritchey - chrtien spectrograph ( rcspec ) , and with the blanco 4 m telescope with the mosaic ii wide - field imager .",
    "targets observed with the spectrograph are listed in table [ table : spectargets ] .",
    "these were all used in our previous studies , and the data were acquired and reduced in the same manner as reported in the earlier paper .",
    "these data were used to extract extinction parameters for the wavelength - dependent processes introduced above .",

    "the slit on rcspec does not rotate to track the parallactic angle of refraction , so all spectra were taken with a 10@xmath28 full aperture .",
    "target stars were first visually centered with the slit closed to 1@xmath28 , then the slit was opened to acquire spectra .",

    "quartz lamp flats and neon lamp calibration exposures were taken with each new pointing of the telescope .",
    "reductions of 2-d images to 1-d spectra were performed with iraf software , and included overscan and bias removal , sky subtraction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "initial correction of the spectra for instrumental signature and flux calibration was done using standard targets fiege 110 and ltt 9239 without telluric correction .",
    "the reduced spectra were fit with model stellar spectra @xcite and templates of atmospheric absorption computed with the modtran code @xcite .",

    "refinement of the instrumental signature is also included in these fits as described in our earlier publication .    for purposes of this work ,",
    "the important components are molecular scattering and absorption ( @xmath31 ) , ozone ( @xmath32 ) , and the aerosol ( mie ) optical depth represented by the formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 = 6750  is chosen for convenience in the middle of the wavelength range of the observations , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are projections of the telescope pointing respectively in the east - west and north - south directions .",

    "bias and flats were taken daily in each band , and the iraf mscred package was used to correct the science images obtained on each corresponding night .",
    "each image was fitted with a world coordinate system ( wcs ) solution using the iraf mscred and mscfinder packages with object lists taken from the usno - b astrometric catalog .",

    "a corrected top - of - the - atmosphere `` flat - sed '' source magnitude was then computed by correcting the raw instrumental magnitude for both wavelength - dependent atmospheric extinction and the instrumental response of the appropriate band ,    @xmath63    the integral in equation [ eqn : mtoa ] was computed numerically for each source on each image as a sum over 1 nm wide wavelength bins .",
    "the resulting corrected magnitudes were then used to construct object catalogs for the different fields observed during the run .      in what follows ,",
    "we consider only those objects that dophot unambiguously classified as stars ( type = 1 ) .",
    "the dophot software is particularly good at separating stars from extended objects ( schechter _ op.cit._ ) . and as shown below , the colors of our final sample track the well - known stellar locus with little indication of contamination by non - stellar objects .",
    "an object catalog was created for each field by associating sources seen on repeated images at the same celestial coordinates to a single object .",
    "subsets of twenty images of each field were chosen as `` build '' samples , and stellar sources with @xmath64 ( s / n @xmath65 1 ) were selected from each of these images .",
    "a nested sorting routine then identified nearest neighbors and next - to - nearest neighbors for pairs of sources found on different images .",
    "a friends - of - friends algorithm was used to collect these pairs into objects .",
    "pairs were considered to come from the same object if they are within 1 @xmath28 of each other on the sky ; stellar densities in the sample fields are sufficiently low that with this choice there is negligible contamination from random overlap of true objects .",
    "the resulting number of objects found in each field is given in table [ table : targets ] .",
    "the full catalog for the study was then compiled by associating sources found on the remaining images to objects found in the `` build '' samples .    a first estimate of the magnitude of each object in each band was made by finding the brightest observed @xmath66 and computing an average value @xmath67 from all observations of that object that were within 0.06 mag ( @xmath68 ) of the brightest .",
    "the distribution of colors @xmath69 and @xmath70 computed from these magnitudes is shown in figure [ fig : color_color ] .",
    "the distribution is consistent with the well - known main - sequence stellar locus , and indicates a clean separation of stellar point sources in the data .",
    "the analysis then concentrated on the numerous @xmath42-band data by selecting objects that satisfied the following criteria :    * the estimated object magnitude in the @xmath42-band satisfies @xmath71 ; this corresponds to signal - to - noise ratios of approximately 10 - 300 for the exposure time , seeing , and sky conditions of our sample . *",
    "the object was observed in more than 10 @xmath42-band images with photometric measurement error @xmath72 . *",
    "the object is spatially separated by more than 5@xmath28 from any other object in the catalog .",
    "all objects that passed these criteria were randomly separated into `` calibration '' objects ( with 70% probability ) and `` test '' objects ( with 30% probability ) . as implied by the terminology , calibration objects were used to determine calibration constants for each image , and test objects were used to test the accuracy of the interpolation of these constants to random positions on each image .",
    "a first estimate of @xmath24 at the location of each calibration object on each image was computed as the difference of the estimated @xmath73 and the @xmath74 observed in the image . a first estimate of the average cloud opacity across the field of view on each image was then computed as the average of the estimated @xmath23 of all calibration objects seen on the image .",

    "essentially all images taken in clear conditions could be calibrated , and even in rather poor conditions the fraction of images that could be calibrated with good precision remains high .",
    "but , as discussed below , the precision of the calibration falters as the photon statistics worsen and stars drop out of the calibration sample with deteriorating observing conditions .",

    "photometric calibration can be separated into three steps :    * relative calibration : internal normalization of measurements in a given bandpass relative to all other measurements made in the same bandpass across the sky and at different times .",

    "* absolute calibration of colors : determination of the ratios of flux normalizations of the standard passbands .",
    "* absolute calibration of flux : definition of an overall physical scale .",

    "the photometric errors @xmath56 ( _ cf . _ sec .",
    "[ section : reductions ] ) include statistical fluctuations in source and background counts , random errors in corrections for seeing - dependent aperture losses and other uncertainties in the assignment of adu counts to source flux measurements .",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 terms represent errors in the calibration of adu counts to physical units .",
    "the @xmath96 are fixed offsets of the zero - points of the photometric bands from the absolute normalization of the physical scale that are determined in the second and third calibration steps .",
    "the @xmath97 are relative errors of the internal zeropoint around @xmath96 that depend on position in the field of view ( @xmath98 ) , position on the sky ( @xmath99 ) , date and time of the observation , the observational bandpass @xmath100 , and the source sed .",
    "the average of @xmath97 over the survey is zero by construction , but a value must be determined for each source location in each image . in this work , we primarily address determination of that part of @xmath101 caused by variation in transmission of light through the atmosphere , in particular variation due to gray cloud cover @xmath24 .      after reduction of each image , correction for chromatic atmospheric extinction , and transformation to the standard passbands ,",
    "a global self - calibration procedure was used to minimize the dispersion of residual errors in all observations of the calibration objects .",
    "this process is based on techniques originated for imaging surveys @xcite ; the specific implementation used here is based on the `` bercal '' procedure developed for sdss @xcite and applied to data taken in photometric conditions free of clouds by several authors @xcite .",
    "this technique minimizes residual errors in both the image reductions and chromatic extinction corrections , and we extend it here to correct for the gray opacity of cloud cover over a range of non - photometric conditions .",
    "`` calibration patches '' were defined on the camera focal plane that are small compared to the full field of view , but large enough to contain sufficient numbers of calibration stars to achieve good precision .",
    "for example , @xmath102 calibration stars with photometric errors @xmath103 would provide sub - percent relative calibrations if the cloud structure is sufficiently simple to allow a single average to be taken over each patch .",
    "images taken by future surveys are expected to contain @xmath0 such star per square arcmin , and an important objective of our study is to determine if this is sufficient to reach the goals of these surveys .",
    "several of the fields we chose for this study ( table [ table : targets ] ) are at sufficiently low galactic latitudes to provide similar densities of stars in 15 second exposures with the blanco .",
    "so we partition the mosaic ii @xmath52 focal plane into sixteen @xmath104 patches .",
    "future surveys will `` dither '' pointings from epoch to epoch to control systematic errors .",
    "the calibration is joined smoothly across patch boundaries as stars fall on different patches on different epochs across the sky .",
    "we implement this feature in our study by defining two different patterns of patches - one pattern for even - numbered images , and the other for odd - numbered images . the patterns are internally dithered by shifting the boundaries of the central four patches by @xmath105 pixels relative to a perfectly symmetrical division of the mosaic ii focal plane into sixteen patches of equal size .",

    "a tight core of images is evident ( the figure is saturated ) that we identify as containing those taken through cloudless photometric sky .",
    "as discussed below , the absolute zero - point of the calibration is not constrained by the fitting algorithm ; its value is set by the procedure used to initialize the fitting process .",
    "as expected , the higher - order terms are approximately centered on zero , and exhibit the same ( saturated ) photometric core of observations",
    ".    fits to samples of images selected to cover ranges of mean cloud thickness are shown in figures [ fig : sample_fits_0 ] , [ fig : sample_fits_1 ] , [ fig : sample_fits_2 ] , and [ fig : sample_fits_3 ] .",
    "the measured ( eq . [ eqn : grayform ] ) and fitted ( eq . [ eqn : grayext ] ) gray values for each calibration object in the image are plotted against the @xmath109 and @xmath110 locations of the object in the image coordinate system .",
    "the mean of the measured gray values ( eq . [ eqn : grayext ] ) of all calibration objects on the image ( given in the figure caption ) has been subtracted from the both the measured and fitted values to avoid loss of resolution on the vertical scale .",
    "the variation in the fitted values at a fixed @xmath109 or @xmath110 is due to the sampling of the extinction by calibration objects in the corresponding orthogonal coordinate .",
    "figures [ fig : sample_fits_0 ] and [ fig : sample_fits_1 ] compare results from the second and third - order fits to the same data , while figures [ fig : sample_fits_2 ] and [ fig : sample_fits_3 ] show third - order fits to extreme cases of cloud structure .    all the fits are well behaved across the field of view , and thanks to the dither of the grouping of calibration stars between even and odd numbered images , they are smoothly connected across patch boundaries .",
    "( patch boundaries occur at approximately half - integer intervals in the image coordinate space , and the dither corresponds to @xmath133 in the image coordinate space . )",
    "though it takes a moment to adjust the eye , distinctive features can be discerned in the structure of the cloud optical depth .",
    "for example , image 1132 of j2103 observed through an average of 0.480 mag of gray extinction on the night of july 4 shows two regions of approximately constant gray extinction when projected onto the horizontal coordinate ( i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) ; these project to two bands along the vertical coordinate .",
    "similar structure can be seen especially in image 1107 taken through 1.089 mag of gray extinction .",
    "image 3070 of cd-329927 was taken through little , if any , cloud cover in what are characterized as photometric conditions .",
    "the scatter of the measurements in this image is dominated by statistical errors , but both the measured and fitted values show small systematic variations across the field of view that persist from image to image .",
    "these variations contribute to the `` zero - point structure function '' discussed below .",
    "finally in this section , we comment on the origin and meaning of the calibration zero - points .",
    "expanded distributions of the @xmath136 values ( eq . [ eqn : grayext ] ) for the two model fits are shown in figure [ fig : gc_corrections ] .",
    "it can be seen that the fitted @xmath116 are systematically brighter than the observed magnitude @xmath137 with a most probable offset of about 0.02 mag .",
    "the technique used to make initial estimates of the flux of the calibration objects and the average gray extinction in each image produces a systematic underestimate of the object magnitude and overestimate of the extinction ; the results depend on the number of observations that are made and on the range of magnitudes used to compute the average extinction .",
    "the fitting procedure is insensitive to a common offset of all observed magnitudes within a given field and band , and does not provide any mathematical constraint between celestial fields that do not spatially overlap .",
    "so only to the extent that the instrumental and chromatic atmospheric extinction calibrations are absolute can we expect the @xmath42-band zero - points to be the same in the three fields used in this study .",
    "but we can make meaningful comparisons of the repeated observations of each object in a particular field and passband .",
    "we want to determine the order of the model used to fit the gray extinction that maximizes the information captured in the model . but to avoid introducing unphysical behaviour in the solution , we do not want to severely over - fit the calibration data . statistical evaluation of the information in the atmospheric model ( e.g. the akaike information criterion corrected for sample size ) indicates that the model captures more information with the addition of the cubic terms .",
    "but we find that the physical parameters deduced from the full analysis ( presented below ) are equivalent for the second and third - order models , and conclude that , for these data , there is no gain from including still higher - order parameterizations .",
    "the density of calibration stars limits the detail that can be successfully built into the calibration model .",
    "as noted above , in cloudy conditions the calibration becomes poorer as the flux of light from calibration stars is reduced , and also as the density of useful calibration stars becomes smaller .",
    "figure [ fig : ncalstars ] shows the count of calibration stars for all observations as a function of the cloud absorption . as expected the number of stars that pass the cuts applied in the selection of the calibration and test samples decreases considerably with absorption , but this is not the only effect we need to take into account .",
    "the @xmath129 statistic depends on the distribution of magnitudes of the calibration stars , and the effective density of calibration points will not be simply the numerical density of calibration stars .",
    "we can define an effective weight to the global calibration @xmath129 from stars of a given photometric error , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the number of observations of calibration objects with photometric error @xmath56 within a given data sample . shown in figure [ fig : calmags ] is @xmath140 and its cumulative distribution computed for the full sample of calibration objects .",
    "it can be seen that , for these data , @xmath141 of the @xmath129 comes from observations with @xmath142 , while as also shown in the figure , this corresponds to about 30% of the observations of calibration objects .",
    "so the effective density of calibration points is less than that estimated from the number counts alone .",
    "further insight to the information in the model can be gained by examining the distribution of residual differences between magnitudes of the calibration objects determined from the global fits and the magnitudes found in individually calibrated observations .",
    "the measured magnitudes of all calibration and test objects @xmath43 on all images @xmath58 were corrected using the results of the global fit to yield the calibrated observations @xmath143 , @xmath144 for calibration objects , these can then compared to @xmath116 extracted from the fit to compute the residual of each observation , @xmath145 distributions of the residuals normalized by their photometric measurement errors ( `` pulls '' @xmath146 ) are shown in figures [ fig : m6_calpulls ] and [ fig : m10_calpulls ] . shown overlaid on the data are gaussian distributions with standard deviation equal one and normalized to the total number of observations in each plot ; these would be expected to reproduce the distribution of pulls if the fitting model is true and complete and the photometric errors are gaussian .",
    "it can be seen that the assignments of errors in the photometric reductions are generally quite good .",
    "but the distributions for the third - order fit are generally more narrow than statistics would predict .",
    "this indicates some level of over - fitting to the data .",
    "conversely the distributions for the second - order fit , particularly the pulls to the observations with @xmath142 that dominate the fit , indicate that there remains information in the data not fully captured in the model .",
    "we complete a full analysis and present results for both models in order to test the sensitivity of our conclusions to the order of the model .",
    "the primary measure of success for the work here is the internal precision ( reproducability ) of the photometric calibration of the data .",
    "we want the repeatability of measurements of magnitudes of a celestial object to be limited only by the shot noise in the photon counts of the source and background sky .",
    "the precision of the calibration procedure can not be estimated from the residuals of the observations of calibration objects as they are biased by the fit itself .",
    "so we use the test objects that were randomly separated from the calibration objects , but in all other respects were chosen and processed in the same way .",
    "the observations of test objects randomly sample the error in the calibration model and provide an unbiased estimate of the calibration precision .",
    "the error - weighted mean of the calibrated magnitudes @xmath143 of each test object @xmath43 was computed , @xmath147 and the residuals of individual measurements of test objects then defined in a way analogous to that for the calibration objects , @xmath148 the distribution of @xmath149 is shown in figure [ fig : gc_test_0 ] for all observations of all test objects in the fields under study .",
    "the solid curve shown in the plot is a model computed by representing each observation by a unit gaussian , @xmath150 where the parameter @xmath151 is the bin size in @xmath152 used to histogram the data , and @xmath153 is a model value for the full statistical error in the measurement .",
    "the data do not support a full evaluation of the covariance of the errors in the different parameters derived by the calibration fit .",
    "so we assume them to be independent of each other and to be gaussian distributed with standard deviation @xmath154 which we take to be a single constant for a given sample of the data .",
    "the total error in the calibrated magnitude extracted from an observation of a test object is then , @xmath155    the value of @xmath154 was varied and a best fit ( @xmath129 with root-@xmath156 errors ) made to distributions of residuals for various subsets of the test observations .",
    "the fits are made to the histogram counts using bins with @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the curve in figure [ fig : gc_test_0 ] is the sum of @xmath156 over all observations of all test objects computed with the value of the calibration error @xmath154 that yields the best fit to the data .",
    "we also show in figure [ fig : gc_test_2 ] the equivalent plot for the subset of observations with @xmath159 .",
    "the model yields a good fit in all cases , so we conclude that our simple ansatz for the calibration error is sufficient to characterize the data .    the values of @xmath154 extracted from samples of the data with various views are summarized in tables [ table : models ] , [ table : fitresults ] , and [ table : calgray ] .",

    "we can make a rough accounting of the contributions to the standard deviation @xmath161 magnitude reported in table [ table : calgray ] for observations made in `` photometric '' conditions .",
    "errors @xmath56 in measurements of the fluxes from stars that effectively contribute to the calibration at a point on a given image are largely statistical ; from the values of the zero - point structure functions ( zpsf ) presented below we estimate these to be @xmath162 magnitude for fields at lower galactic latitudes .",

    "our premise is that the structure functions of gray extinction reported here are determined by 2d projections of the 3d cloud structure along the line of sight ; such a projection of kolmogorov 3d structure function will scale with the @xmath206 power of the 2d spatial separation @xcite .",

    "we note that our data are sensitive to cloud thickness averaged over an extent and direction determined by the tracking of the telescope and movement of clouds during the exposure of the image .",
    "it is not our goal to study cloud formation per se , but rather to construct a model that we can use to estimate the effect of clouds on the calibration of our data .",

    "the results of this procedure are included in figure [ fig : gsfplot ] and the fitted values of @xmath213 and @xmath212 are given in table [ table : gsfsum ] .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the measurement is limited by the number of images available in the sample .",

    "the total contribution to the overall calibration error grows with increasing cloud thickness ( last column in table [ table : gsfsum ] ) , while structure relative to the mean absorption represented by @xmath216 is seen to be greatest for the thinnest layers .",
    "a previous study of cloud extinction in sdss has been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the structure function in that data was found to have a stronger dependence on separation ( @xmath226 ) , but with amplitudes at @xmath227 separation ( the column separation in the sdss imager ) @xmath228 times smaller .",
    "this may reflect differences of the observatory site , exposure times , or may simply be variance of atmospheric conditions during the acquisition of the particular data samples .",
    "the principal results of this paper are those in tables [ table : models ] , [ table : fitresults ] , [ table : calgray ] , and [ table : gsfsum ] , and in figures [ fig : gsfplot ] and [ fig : gsferr ] .",
    "our observations span a reasonable range of atmospheric conditions , but certainly do not include all possible types or thicknesses of cloud cover .",
    "nevertheless , the data do allow a number of important general issues to be addressed , and we can draw some conclusions from our analyses :    * we have demonstrated a method to calibrate imaging data to relative precisions of a per cent or better through cloud layers that produce as much as a magnitude of wavelength - independent extinction .",
    "the technique relies on obtaining a sufficiently large number of repeated observations of each field , at least some of which are made in photometric conditions .",
    "but it does not rely on identification of the images that were taken in photometric conditions ; it is an `` all weather '' calibration . *",
    "the standard deviation @xmath154 of calibrated observations of test stars made in conditions with minimal cloud cover ( deemed `` photometric '' after the fact ) was found to be @xmath229 magnitude in our fields at lower galactic latitudes ( table [ table : calgray ] ) . *",
    "the degradation of the reproducability of the calibration with increasing cloud thickness ( table [ table : calgray ] ) is consistent with the measured structure of clouds when the calibration is interpolated over the effective spacings of calibration stars on the sky @xmath230 at lower galactic latitudes ( table [ table : gsfsum ] ) .",
    "* for the conditions encountered during the observing reported here , the structure functions of thin cloud layers were greater relative to their mean thicknesses than those of thicker ( and apparently relatively smoother ) cloud layers .",
    "so thin broken clouds can produce substantial instability in calibration results , though the precision of the calibration will degrade steadily with increasing cloud thickness ( tables [ table : calgray ] and [ table : gsfsum ] ) .",
    "this seems to support the observer s adage that atmospheric conditions are either photometric or not , and implies that it will be important for surveys to identify `` photometric '' observing opportunities as rapidly and accurately as possible . * to fully utilize observing time , it may be advantagous for surveys to implement auxiliary instrumentation specifically dedicated to characterization of thin cloud structure on relatively fine spatial scales ( e.g. sensitive thermal ir cameras or lidar systems ) @xcite . * to take full advantage of the techniques studied here these surveys will want to account for the amount and character of cloud cover .",
    "for example , it will be advantagous to concentrate high galactic latitude observations during photometric conditions , and reserve observing during cloudy conditions for low galactic fields in order to maintain a sufficient density of calibration stars in view .",
    "* there are several possible improvements to the calibration procedure presented here that could be explored with larger data sets .",
    "our choice of polynomial models for cloud structure may not be optimum ; for example , fields with sufficiently high densities of stars might be calibrated with pixelated corrections .",
    "it might also be possible to pre - select a `` photometric '' sample of images for each field that could be fit with a simpler geometric or temporally smoothed model to determine reference magnitudes for the calibration stars ; these values could then be used in re - calibration of the overall survey ( including `` non - photometric '' data ) .",
    "* we have not addressed the spatial uniformity or absolute accuracy of the photometric zero - points or measured colors .",
    "calibration of absolute broad - band scales will require different techniques .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the instrumental throughput can be measured with good precision using controlled light sources and specially designed dispersal systems @xcite . and",
    "proposals have been made to use observations of well characterized white dwarf stars @xcite , or analysis of the color distributions of main sequence stars @xcite to determine the accuracy of measured colors .",
    "calibration of the absolute accuracy of the flux scale remains yet another problem , though one upon which relatively few science analyses depend .",
