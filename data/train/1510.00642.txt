    "the description of fluctuations in spiking networks deployed in this study proceeds in two steps , as summarized in . in the first step ,",
    "we use mean - field theory for spiking neurons @xcite to determine the stationary state of the network , i.e. the time - independent averaged firing rates of each population . in particular , the original high - dimensional system , composed of the two dynamical variables in for each of the @xmath22 neurons , is reduced by means of diffusion approximation .",

    "we employ linear response theory , applied to the leaky integrate - and - fire model , using an extension of the work of @xcite and @xcite to colored synaptic noise @xcite .",
    "we here summarize the main results of the mapping of the dynamics of the fluctuations , referring the reader to @xcite for the detailed derivations .",
    "the reduction allows for a self - consistent dynamical description of the fluctuations of the population rates .",

    "the formulation of the rate dynamics yields predictions for the population rate spectra ( for further details see _ `` '' _ ) .",
    "e shows that the low-@xmath0 peak around @xmath37 , visible in the spectra of all populations , is well predicted by this theory . as suggested by the regularly occurring vertical stripes in b",
    ", we observe a high - frequency peak in all populations varying from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , which is most prominent in layer 4 .",
    "it can be shown that in the context of the low-@xmath0 peak , the network is in the asynchronous irregular ( ai ) regime @xcite , where the linear response theory suffices to describe the noise fluctuations . however , on the time scale of the high - frequency peak the network verges on the border of the synchronous irregular state ( si ) , resulting in deviations of the theoretical prediction from the observed oscillations .",
    "the frequency of the fast oscillations depends strongly and inversely on the synaptic time constants , which are small in the present model ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore the frequency would be considerably lower for longer time constants ( see _ `` ''",
    "the high - frequency peak will therefore , in the following , be referred to as the high-@xmath0 peak .",
    "given the density of connections in the circuit ( c ) , the similarity of the spectra hints at the oscillation being generated in a sub - circuit of the microcircuit and subsequently imposed onto all populations .",
    "this prevents the identification of the sub - circuitry generating the oscillation on the basis of the spectra .",
    "thus the analytical tools developed in our study up to this point enable the prediction of the population firing rate spectra , but do not allow for the inspection of the underlying circuits determining the characteristics of the spectra .",
    "rate profiles have been observed to vary across cortical layers @xcite , with inhibitory neurons displaying higher rates than excitatory neurons ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "as a result of the population specific rates , each population processes the afferent time - dependent activity with its specific temporal filter , called transfer function in systems theory @xcite . here",
    ", we summarize how peaks at different frequencies in the spectra can be associated with the activity of coexisting dynamical modes , which can be found by a linear basis transformation of the rate fluctuations , as described in _ `` ' ' _ .",
    "intuitively , a mode describes the tendency of a set of neuronal populations to co - fluctuate with a fixed relationship between their amplitudes and relative phases .",
    "subsequently we discuss how population specific transfer functions result in the commingling of modes across frequencies and therefore hinder the analytical tractability of the anatomical origins of the oscillations .    considering the linearity of the relation between input to the populations and the resulting output rate ( for details see and the derivation in _ `` '' _ ) , the influence of the connectivity on the rate dynamics and thus the shape of the spectrum appears to be straightforwardly investigated by applying tools from linear algebra to the effective connectivity matrix , which is defined by the element - wise product ( hadamard product ) of the anatomical connectivity , determined by connection weights , in - degrees and the population specific transfer functions @xmath41 .",

    "their dynamical behavior is linked to the frequency dependence of the corresponding eigenvalues as shown in b and discussed in _ `` ' ' _ .",
    "indeed , we observe that the term @xmath48 exhibits a peak at around @xmath49 with a shape reminiscent of the peaks in the theoretically predicted spectra as well as in the spectra observed in simulations ( ) . this similarity is not surprising , since the inverse of the distance of the eigenvalue to one contributes to the spectrum of all populations . at higher frequencies",
    "the eigenvalues of four modes produce a maximum with the dominant mode being largest at @xmath50 , corresponding to the high-@xmath0 peak in e. all modes but one exhibit small terms @xmath51 for low frequencies .",
    "the involvement of the mode that corresponds to the large values of @xmath51 at low frequencies in the generation of slow rate fluctuations is discussed in the following sections .    at peak frequencies the dynamics of the circuit can be approximated by the dynamics of the dominant mode .",
    "results for the spectra in the excitatory populations of layer 2/3 and 4 are shown in c. the reduced circuitry suffices to approximate the spectrum around the low-@xmath0 peak , but for lower and in particular higher frequencies the absence of contributions of the remaining modes becomes apparent .",
    "since the dynamics in the vicinity of a peak are well approximated by the dominant mode , the question arises as to how much information about the minimal anatomical circuit producing the same oscillation is contained in the mode representation . as discussed in _",
    "`` '' _ and illustrated in a , a frequency independent projection from the dynamics of the full circuit to the dynamical modes is only attainable if all populations have the same firing rate and transfer function . in this case",
    "each dynamical mode can be traced back to one particular set of anatomical connections which does not influence the dynamics of the other modes .",
    "heterogeneous rates and response properties of the populations result in dynamical modes composed of different anatomical connections at different frequencies .",
    "thus the mapping between a set of anatomical connections and a dynamical mode is limited to one particular frequency , while the same set of connections might influence other modes at other frequencies .",
    "the representation of the activity modes determining the characteristics of the spectra is hence frequency dependent .",
    "therefore the eigenmode can not straightforwardly be mapped to the relevant anatomical connection as in the case of networks with populations in homogeneous dynamical states .      in this section",
    "we provide an intuitive understanding of how the dynamics of the eigenvalues determine the spectra as well as how the eigenvalues originate from the connectivity of the individual layers and are shaped by the connections between the layers .",
    "readers primarily interested in the final method used to detect the origin of the oscillations may skip this section .",
    "the dynamics of the eigenmodes are mainly described by the eigenvalues .",
    "the frequency dependence of the complex - valued eigenvalues , termed `` trajectories '' in the following , is visualized in parametric plots ( a ) .",
    "these plots , also known as nyquist plots ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) , allow for the simultaneous investigation of the real and imaginary part of the eigenvalue .",
    "a shows the trajectories of the eight eigenvalues of the microcircuit in the complex plane up to @xmath52 .",
    "the movement of a trajectory is reminiscent of a spiral starting at the eigenvalue of the effective connectivity matrix at zero frequency and spiraling clockwise towards zero with increasing frequency .",
    "b together with the final expression for the spectrum shows that the amplitude of the spectrum increases the closer an eigenvalue approaches the value one and decreases the further it moves away .",
    "the spectrum diverges if the eigenvalue assumes one , which will therefore be referred to as the critical value one .",
    "the implications of this critical value for the stability of the circuit are discussed in more detail in _ `` ' ' _ . all trajectories eventually converge to zero , reflecting that the modes can not follow very high frequencies .",
    "hence the term @xmath53 , which contributes considerably to the shape of the spectrum , converges to one for high frequencies .",
    "the eigenvalue trajectories @xmath46 in the microcircuit are typically continuous and spin clockwise for all frequencies .",
    "hence , if a trajectory reaches the sector of positive real parts it will , in the general case , for at least one frequency @xmath54 assume a closer distance to one than in the large frequency limit . at this frequency",
    "the term @xmath55 assumes larger values than one , yielding a peak in the spectrum .",
    "the eigenvalues can be interpreted as the transfer function of the modes ( a ) . from the shape of the transfer functions corresponding to the populations we deduce that small delays slow down the spinning of the trajectories .",
    "the eigenvalue therefore passes by one at a high frequency resulting in rapid oscillations .",
    "long delays accelerate the trajectories yielding slow oscillations .",
    "however , the longer the delay the larger the radius of the trajectories .",
    "once the eigenvalue assumes a real part larger than one at the frequency where it passes closest to the critical value one the mode produces activity in the si regime .",
    "the transition from the regime where the real part of the eigenvalue is smaller than one to the regime where the real part is larger than one is characterized by a change in stability .",
    "below one , the dynamics relaxes back to the stationary rates in an oscillatory fashion determined by the frequency at which the distance to one is minimal with a damping related to this minimal distance .",
    "nevertheless , since the noise propagating in the system repeatedly excites these oscillatory decaying modes , the oscillations are visible in the population rate spectra . altering the parameters of the circuit such that the eigenvalue assumes the value one for some frequency @xmath56 , the system ( defined by in the fourier and by in the time domain ) transits from damped to amplified oscillatory modes ( as discussed in more detail in _",
    "`` '' _ ) .",
    "growing modes are restrained by the non - linearities of the neurons .",
    "hence , the point at which one eigenvalue assumes the value one characterizes the passage of the corresponding mode dynamics from oscillatory decaying rate perturbations to the onset of sustained oscillations .",
    "if the eigenvalue assumes real values larger than one , the equivalent linear rate system is unstable and displays an irresistibly growing oscillatory mode .",
    "the system of lif model neurons , however , provides stabilizing non - linearities ( due to the reset after firing and the fact that the rates of the neurons can not become negative ) which prevent the dynamics from exploding .",
    "since the presented theoretical framework does not account for non - linearities , it is limited to predicting the tendencies of the spectra in the latter case as visible in the high frequency peak in e.    the radius of the trajectory is compressed by widely distributed delays , allowing for the production of slower oscillations caused by long delays without destabilization of the dynamics .    in order to analyze the dynamics originating in the individual layers we calculate the eigenvalue trajectories of the isolated layers .",
    "the input of other layers is provided by means of poisson spike trains .",
    "this approach holds the dynamic state of the populations constant while neglecting the correlations induced by the input from other layers .",
    "hence the collective dynamics emerging locally in each layer can be analyzed .",
    "the eigenvalue trajectories corresponding to the isolated layers are displayed in b.    since the connectivity within the layers is more pronounced than the connectivity between the layers , we can deduce the origin of some of the eigenvalue trajectories by comparing their characteristics with the characteristics of the trajectories in the original circuit ( a and b ) . in isolation",
    ", layer 2/3 produces an eigenvalue which passes closest to one at @xmath57 .",
    "since the distance to one is large , the eigenvalue trajectory produces only a small peak in the spectrum of layer 2/3 ( c ) .",
    "layer 4 in isolation does not generate a low-@xmath0 peak ( c ) .",
    "connecting the layers , the eigenvalue trajectories of layers 2/3 and 4 mix and produce a trajectory with a positive imaginary offset and a sufficiently small real - valued starting point to pass close by one at a relatively low frequency ( @xmath58 ) , resulting in a peak in the spectra of all populations .    in the high frequency range",
    "we observe four trajectories originating in the four layers passing close by one .",
    "the course of the trajectories is only mildly impacted when integrated into the full circuit .",
    "therefore we predict a high frequency peak visible in the populations , even in the isolated layers .",
    "however , considering the spectra in layer 2/3 and 4 we observe that the high frequency peak in layer 4 matches the peak observed in the full circuit , whereas the peak produced in layer 2/3 is of smaller frequency and amplitude .",
    "therefore we can already conclude that the high-@xmath0 peak originates in layer 4 and is propagated to the other layers when embedded in the full circuit .",
    "in addition to the origin of the oscillation , the eigenvalue trajectories shed light on the stability of the circuit and the associated oscillations . following the classification of brunel @xcite , the dynamics of a mode transits from the ai to the si regime via a hopf bifurcation",
    "if there is a frequency at which the corresponding eigenvalue equals one .",
    "the dynamics is in the ai regime , i.e. the system possesses a stable fixed point of the rates , if the closest encounter of the corresponding trajectory with the critical value one is located on the left of the latter c ( see also _",
    "`` '' _ ) . here , temporal structure in the firing rates arises from oscillatory , but decaying perturbations , which are continuously excited by the noise generated within the system .",
    "the damping factor of decaying perturbations grows with the distance of the eigenvalue from one , while the amplitude of the peak in the spectrum diminishes .",
    "in addition , brunel et al .",
    "@xcite show that networks of lif - model neurons close to a bifurcation point are stabilized by the non - linearity of the neuron dynamics .",
    "hence , perturbations decaying with low-@xmath0 frequency are strongly damped .",
    "the assumption of independence on the level of individual neurons , which underlies the mean - field approximation in the first step of our framework , is therefore justified .",
    "this is reflected by the match of the theoretical prediction of the low-@xmath0 peak with the peak observed in simulations of the microcircuit ( fig .",
    "1 ) . fig .",
    "3c shows that one of the eigenvalues associated to the high-@xmath0 peak lies to the right of one ( corresponding to the si regime in @xcite ) , which , in a linear system , would yield growing oscillatory perturbations .",
    "however , in networks of lif - model neurons these oscillations are tamed by the non - linearity of the neurons .",
    "accordingly , for the high-@xmath0 peak , the theoretical framework only suffices to predict the tendencies of the peak in the spectrum ( ) .    in summary , employing a combination of mean - field and linear response theory we consider the dynamical contributions of the individual layers . in an iterative fashion we narrowed down the origin of the high-@xmath0 peak to layer 4 .",
    "in addition we find indication for the low-@xmath0 peak being shaped in layers 2/3 and 4 .",

    "our aim is to analyze the contribution of the connection from population @xmath8 to population @xmath9 on the fluctuations of activity expressed by the spectra .",

    "a shows the real and imaginary part of the sensitivity measure @xmath74 evaluated at @xmath37 .",
    "the influence of the individual elements on the eigenvalues can be visualized in the complex plane ( b ) .",

    ", the anatomical and dynamical part of the effective connectivity can be treated separately    @xmath178    the anatomical part @xmath179 can be split into eight modes using eigenvalue decomposition yielding the activity of one eigenmode @xmath180    @xmath181    as visualized in the bottom left of a. since the eigenvectors of the effective connectivity matrix for homogeneous transfer functions are frequency independent , the mapping to the mode activity @xmath182 is also constant across frequencies .",
    "the modes can be considered as decoupled circuits , whose activity is fed back to itself and can be treated in isolation .",
    "i.e. an adjustment of the connectivity of one mode does not influence the activity of another mode .",
    "the sum of activities in the circuit , however , is independent of the representation    @xmath183 the spectrum produced by the original circuit is given by the sum of the spectra generated by all possible mode pairs    @xmath184    here the spectrum visible in population @xmath12 receives contributions from all mode pairs @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the prefactors @xmath185 are common to the spectrum of all populations and thus determine the global frequency dependence of the spectra .",
    "the visibility of the global characteristics of the spectrum in the spectra of the individual populations is determined by the frequency independent factor @xmath186 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath185 is large if one of the eigenvalues of the effective connectivity matrix comes close to one at a particular frequency @xmath156 , resulting in a peak of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , at peak frequency @xmath156 the contribution of the critical mode ( @xmath187 ) constitutes the dominant part of the spectrum and we can approximate the spectrum of the circuit by the spectrum of the critical mode    @xmath188    the anatomical sub - circuit responsible for the peak can now directly be deduced from the definition of @xmath189 as the outer product of the eigenvectors of the critical mode . removing the correlations induced by these connections ( i.e. substituting the input provided by these connections with white noise ) from the anatomical connectivity matrix @xmath190 removes the contributions of the critical mode ( in particular the peak in the spectrum ) , but leaves contributions of the remaining modes to the spectrum unaltered .",
    "the assumption of identical transfer functions of the populations entering the previous argument requires equal dynamic states of all populations .",
    "this in turn results in all populations displaying the same firing rates , which disagrees with experimental findings .",
    "* *    we therefore need to take population specific transfer functions into account , resulting in frequency dependent eigenvectors and eigenvalues and hence frequency dependent representations of the dynamical modes .",
    "the activity of one mode is now given by @xmath191    @xmath192    as illustrated in the bottom right of a.    in this case not only the prefactor but also the outer product of the eigenvectors is frequency dependent    @xmath193    the peak in the spectrum and hence the dynamics of the critical eigenmode at @xmath156 could be removed by the adjustment @xmath194 . however , due to the frequency dependence of the mode representation , the same set of anatomical connections relevant for this mode at @xmath156 might also take part in the generation of the dynamics of another mode at a different frequency . therefore removing the dynamical contribution of the anatomical connections contributing to one mode at one frequency",
    "will remove this particular oscillation , but may also impair other modes .      to analyze the stability of the circuit",
    ", we consider the convolution equation , that describes the rates in a self - consistent manner , without noise    @xmath195    the variable describing the rate of each population can be replaced by its laplace back - transformation    @xmath196    for complex @xmath197 . here",
    "@xmath198 is the fourier transform of @xmath199 evaluated at the complex laplace frequency @xmath200 .",
    "since convolutions simplify to multiplication in laplace space we get    @xmath201    this condition is fulfilled if either @xmath202 is an eigenvector @xmath203 of @xmath204 with eigenvalue @xmath205 or @xmath202 equals zero .",
    "the integration in equation can hence be rewritten as a sum over all solutions @xmath206 for which @xmath207    @xmath208    where @xmath209 are as yet undetermined constants that could be determined when tackling the inhomogenous problem .",
    "expressed in fourier domain we have @xmath200 so that @xmath210 turns into @xmath211 and @xmath212 into @xmath213    @xmath214    the transfer function @xmath215 and therefore the effective connectivity as well as the activity @xmath108 are real valued functions in time domain . with the complex component in fourier domain originating from the argument @xmath216 , we conclude that @xmath217 has the eigenvector @xmath218 if @xmath219 .",
    "thus @xmath220 contains pairs of values @xmath221 and @xmath222 for each @xmath216 .",
    "can hence be written as :    @xmath223    with @xmath224 containing all @xmath225 .",
    "the equation above reveals that unstable modes exist if there is a solution with @xmath226 . in the context of the eigenvalue trajectories ( a ) in the microcircuit",
    "one needs to investigate the solutions for the eigenvalues for complex frequencies @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out that all eigenvalue trajectories spiraling around the right side of the critical value one exhibit an unstable solution ( @xmath227 for @xmath226 ) ( see inset in a ) and vice versa . if the course of an eigenvalue trajectory is altered by changes in parameters ( for example indegrees ) such that it passes the value one for a real valued frequency ( @xmath227 with @xmath228 ) , the system would undergo a hopf bifurcation .",

    "<S> oscillations are omnipresent in neural population signals , like multi - unit recordings , eeg / meg , and the local field potential . </S>",
    "<S> they have been linked to the population firing rate of neurons , with individual neurons firing in a close - to - irregular fashion at low rates . using a combination of mean - field and linear response theory we predict the spectra generated in a layered microcircuit model of v1 , composed of leaky integrate - and - fire neurons and based on connectivity compiled from anatomical and electrophysiological studies . </S>",
    "<S> the model exhibits low- and high-@xmath0 oscillations visible in all populations . </S>",
    "<S> since locally generated frequencies are imposed onto other populations , the origin of the oscillations can not be deduced from the spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop an universally applicable systematic approach that identifies the anatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations in a given network . </S>",
    "<S> based on a theoretical reduction of the dynamics , we derive a sensitivity measure resulting in a frequency - dependent connectivity map that reveals connections crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of the observed oscillations and identifies the minimal circuit generating a given frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the low-@xmath0 peak turns out to be generated in a sub - circuit located in layer 2/3 and 4 , while the high-@xmath0 peak emerges from the inter - neurons in layer 4 . </S>",
    "<S> connections within and onto layer 5 are found to regulate slow rate fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate how small perturbations of the crucial connections have significant impact on the population spectra , while the impairment of other connections leaves the dynamics on the population level unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> the study uncovers connections where mechanisms controlling the spectra of the cortical microcircuit are most effective . </S>"
