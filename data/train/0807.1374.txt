    "observations of molecular clouds show the existence of small density fluctuations threaded by magnetic fields .",
    "the recent progress of the molecular cloud observations has established that the small and tiny scale structures are very ubiquitous .",
    "for example , langer et al . (",
    "1995 ) observed small condensations with size from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in taurus molecular cloud  1 .",
    "the mass of these fragments is estimated to be @xmath2 .",
    "studies of the time variability of absorption lines indicates the presence of fluctuations on scales of @xmath3 ( 5 - 50 au ) and masses of @xmath4 ( boiss et al .",
    "2005 ) . at larger scales ( about @xmath5  au ) ,",
    "pan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find significant differences in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 absorption lines .",
    "the spitzer experiment has begun producing higher spatial resolution mid - infrared maps ( churchwell et al .",
    "2004 ) and revealed the fine structure of the star forming regions .",
    "the advent of major new facilities in the coming years should yield several breakthroughs in this field ( andr et al .",
    "2008 ) . a higher resolution observation in future is assuredly expected to reveal hidden , small structures , as well as sub - stellar objects with very small mass ( atacama large millimeter array , alma , becoming partly available in 2011 , fully operational at 2013 ) .",
    "the classical problems of cloud fragmentation are relevant to star formation because they show that there is a preferred scale ( jeans length ) of gravitational instability as soon as one considers an initial structured region with some length - scale ( see , e.g. , larson  1985 ) . by the way , it is not easy for the small and tiny scale structure to form as a result of gravitational instability , since their size are much smaller than the jeans length .",
    "according to langer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) indeed , the small scale structures appear to be gravitationally unbound .",
    "this suggests that some fragmentation mechanisms other than pure jeans gravitational instability may be important in the clouds .",
    "molecular clouds are thought to be supersonically turbulent , since they exhibit supersonic linewidths ( zuckerman & palmer  1974 ) .",
    "base on the idea of turbulence , some mechanisms to generate substructures inside molecular clouds have been proposed ( elmegreen 2007 ) .",
    "as well , a further process based on magnetohydrodynamic waves have been suggested to produce inhomogeneities in the clouds ( folini et al .",
    "another basic physical process that could trigger formation of density fluctuations is thermal instability , because it acts on time - scales that can be much shorter than the duration of the turbulent motions ( gilden 1984 ) .",
    "the effect of thermal instability in fragmentation of the clouds is clearly a competitive process relative to other mechanisms , although all could operate .    in molecular clouds",
    ", a neutral molecular gas is intermixed with an ionized component that is tied directly to the magnetic field .",
    "birk  ( 2000 ) has used the two - fluid technique to find the thermal condensation modes in weakly ionized hydrogen plasma .",
    "nejad - asghar & ghanbari  ( 2003 ) studied the effect of linear thermal instability in a weakly ionized magnetic molecular cloud within the one - fluid description .",
    "nejad - asghar ( 2007 ) has recently made the assumption that the molecular cloud is initially an uniform ensemble which then fragments due to thermal instability .",
    "he find that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value , in outer parts of the cloud , can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions .",
    "his results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in intermediate regions of the cloud ; therefore it may produce the cloud fragmentation and formation of the condensations .",
    "the study under the one - fluid approach did not precisely consider the effect of the ion - neutral friction , since they did not treat the flow as two fluids which are composed of ions and neutrals .",
    "then , fukue & kamaya  ( 2007 ) revisited the effect of the ion - neutral friction of the two - fluid on the growth of the linear thermal instability .",
    "their results indicate that the friction with the magnetic field affects the morphology and evolution of the interstellar matter .",
    "falle et al .  ( 2006 ) described numerical calculations using an amr magnetohydrodynamic code that show that thermal instability may have an important role to play in the formation of the hierarchical structure of molecular clouds . here",
    ", we use the two - fluid numerical simulation to study the evolution of weakly ionized molecular clouds in the nonlinear thermal instability regime .",
    "many authors have developed computer codes that attempt to model ion - neutral diffusion .",
    "black & scott  ( 1982 ) used a two - dimensional , deformable - grid algorithm to follow the collapse of isothermal , non - rotating magnetized cloud .",
    "the three - dimensional work of maclow et al .",
    "( 1995 ) treats the two - fluid model in a version of the zeus magnetohydrodynamic code .",
    "an algorithm capable of using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) to implement the ambipolar diffusion in a fully three - dimensional , self - gravitating system was developed by hosking & whitworth ( 2004 , hereafter hw ) .",
    "they described the sph implementation of two - fluid technique that was tested by modeling the evolution of a dense core , which is initially thermally supercritical but magnetically subcritical .    in this paper , we firstly re - formulate and improve the two - fluid sph implementation of the ambipolar diffusion in an isothermal self - gravitating one dimensional slab .",
    "afterwards , we use this two - fluid sph technique to investigate the nonlinear thermal evolution of the slab . in this way",
    ", the continuum equations of the self - gravitating slab and its isothermal case are given is section  2 .",
    "the two - fluid sph technique is presented in section  3 .",
    "section  4 devoted to the chosen physical scales , initial conditions , and the computer experiments to explore the temperature profile and density fluctuations in the contracting one dimensional molecular cloud .",
    "finally , section  5 is allocated to the summary and conclusions with some prospects .",
    "in the absence of reliable information about the structure of the molecular clouds , it is reasonable to examine simple geometries such as sphere , disks , cylinder , etc .",
    ", in order to gain some insight into the evolution process . here",
    ", we consider an one - dimensional lightly ionized molecular gas with purely transverse magnetic field , thus , all variables are functions of distance @xmath9 to the center and time @xmath10 only .",
    "the exact fraction of the total fluid that is ionized depends upon many factors ( e.g. the neutral density , the cosmic ray ionization rate , how efficiently ionized metals are depleted on to dust grains ) . here",
    ", we use the expression employed by fiedler & mouschovias ( 1992 ) , which states that for @xmath11 , @xmath12 where in standard ionized equilibrium state , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are valid . in reality",
    ", the gas in this case is very weakly ionized , thus , we adopt the approximation @xmath15 in fluid equations . in this case , the molecular cloud is considered as global neutral which consists of a mixture of atomic and molecular hydrogen ( with mass fraction @xmath16 ) , helium ( with mass fraction @xmath17 ) , and traces of @xmath18 and other rare molecules , thus , the mean molecular weight is given by @xmath19 .",
    "we write the continuity equation of neutral part as its common form @xmath20 while , the relation ( [ ionden ] ) is used to determine the ion density wherever it is required in the two - fluid equations .",
    "the momentum equation of neutral part then becomes @xmath21 where the gravitational acceleration @xmath22 obeys the poisson s equation @xmath23 and the pressure is given by the ideal gas equation of state @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the molar gas constant and the temperature @xmath26 is approximated the same as for both neutral and ion fluids ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the calculations are usually further simplified by the assumption of an isothermal equation of state .",
    "this last assumption is , however , unnecessarily crude since molecular gas is expected to cool and heat rapidly and appropriate cooling and heating function may be estimated ( e.g. , goldsmith  2001 ) .",
    "the thermal energy per unit mass is generally given by @xmath28 where the mean internal ( rotation and vibration ) energy of an @xmath29 molecule is included .",
    "at temperature below @xmath30 , the rotational and vibration degrees of freedom of molecular hydrogen are not excited , so it actually behaves like a monatomic gas .",
    "the energy equation follows from the first law of thermodynamics , that is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the net cooling function @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the heating rates due to cosmic rays and ambipolar diffusion , respectively , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the parameters for the gas cooling function that here we use the polynomial fitting functions , outlined by nejad - asghar  ( 2007 ) , as follows @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the heating of cosmic rays is given by ( e.g. , goldsmith  2001 ) , @xmath41 while the heating due to ambipolar diffusion can be physical derived by considering the drag force ( per unit volume ) as follows @xmath42 where @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the collision drag coefficient .",
    "the magnetic fields are directly evolved by charged fluid component , as follows : @xmath45 where the last term outlines the ambipolar diffusion effect with drift velocity , @xmath46 which is obtained by assumption that the pressure and gravitational force on the charged fluid component are negligible compared to the lorentz force because of the low ionization fraction .      in isothermal case ,",
    "the thermal energy per unit mass ( [ ut ] ) is overplus , and the pressure in momentum equation ( [ momcon ] ) then becomes @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the isothermal sound speed . following the many previous treatments , a further simplification is possible",
    "if we introduce the surface density between mid - plane and @xmath49 as @xmath50 by transformation from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , the drift velocity is given by @xmath53 and the equation ( [ magcon ] ) becomes @xmath54 with the above , field equation ( [ poisson ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath55 while the equation of continuity ( [ masscon ] ) and the equation of motion ( [ momcon ] ) take the form @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the slab is assumed to be in quasi - magnetohydrostatic equilibrium at all times , supported against its own self - gravity by the magnetic and gas pressures .",
    "the loss of flux from ambipolar diffusion is exactly compensated for by the compression of the slab which is necessary to maintain equilibrium . in this approximation ,",
    "the left - hand side of equation ( [ momcon2 ] ) is zero , and we may integrate the force balance to obtain @xmath58 where integration constant @xmath59 is the value of @xmath60 at @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is zero ) .    following the work of shu  ( 1983 ) , we introduce the non - dimension quantities @xmath63 so that we rewrite the basic equations ( [ magcon2 ] ) , ( [ mascon2 ] ) and ( [ momcon3 ] ) as follows : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 and the drift velocity ( [ drift2 ] ) as @xmath67 here , a natural family of initial states is generated by assuming that the initial ratio of magnetic to gas pressure is everywhere a constant , @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 at @xmath70 . then one finds from equations ( [ momcon4 ] ) , ( [ mascon4 ] ) and ( [ drift3 ] ) that @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the central density of the slab at @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is a length - scale parameter .",
    "figure  [ cloincloud ] shows the initial neural density , ion density , and drift velocity in the cloud and outercloud medium for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "shu  ( 1983 ) solved the equations ( [ magcon4])-([drift3 ] ) by finite difference techniques under the initial and boundary conditions @xmath79 the integrations are carried out to time @xmath80 with initial conditions @xmath78 and @xmath81 , and the results are presented graphically in his paper ( shu  1983 ) .",
    "as the magnetic field leaks from the neutral gas , the volume density of the neutrals shifts in profile from equation ( [ dens ] ) to that case with @xmath82 , and the drift velocity gradually settles .",
    "since the molecular gas is expected to cool and heat rapidly , considering the thermal energy is appropriate . for this aim",
    ", we produce a two - fluid sph implementation more efficient than hw , to study the thermal evolution of the self - gravitating one dimensional molecular cloud . in the technique of hw , the initial sph particles",
    "are represented by two sets of particles : magnetized ion sph particles and non - magnetized neutral sph particles . for each sph particle",
    "we must create two separate neighbor lists : one for neighbors of the same species and another for those of different species .",
    "consequently , each particle must have two different smoothing lengths . in the following sections we refer to neutral particles as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and ion particles as @xmath48 and @xmath85 ; the subscripts @xmath86 and @xmath87 refer to both ions and neutral particles .",
    "the neutral density in place of neutral particles is estimated via usual summation over neighboring neutral particles @xmath88 while in place of ions , @xmath89 , is given by interpolation technique from the values of nearest neighbors .",
    "the ion density is evaluated via equation ( [ ionden ] ) for both places of ions and neutral particles . in the particle approximation of sph method ,",
    "the infinitesimal volume in the integrations at the location of particle @xmath48 is replaced by the finite volume of that particle @xmath90 , which is related to the mass and density as @xmath91 . since the ion density is evaluated by equation ( [ ionden ] ) , no by the usual summation rule @xmath92 we must update the mass of ion @xmath48 as follows @xmath93 in each time step so that the above summation / interpolation routine for ions ( [ ionsum ] ) being accurate .",

    "the artificial viscosity is reconsidered in sph to prevent inter - particle penetration , unwanted heating , and unphysical solutions .",
    "nejad - asghar , khesali & soltani ( 2008 ) has recently considered the coefficients in the monaghan s standard artificial viscosity as time variable , and a restriction on them is proposed such that avoiding the undesired effects in the subsonic regions . here",
    ", we use the monaghan s standard artificial viscosity , since the cloud contraction is quasi - hydrostatic and there is not supersonic motions and shock formation during this contraction . keeping in mind the second golden rule of sph which is to rewrite formulae with the density inside operators ( monaghan  1992 )",
    ", we can optimize the drift velocity of hw as follows @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where two extra density terms are introduced , one outside and one inside the summation sign .",
    "this comes as a result of the approximation to the volume integral needed to perform function interpolation .",
    "the drift velocity at neutral places are used to estimate the drag acceleration @xmath97 instead the method of hw who used the expression of monaghan & kocharayan  ( 1995 ) .",
    "since there is no any analytical expression that allows us to calculate the value of drift velocity in place of the neutral particles , we use the interpolation technique that starts at the nearest neighbor , then add a sequence of decreasing corrections , as information from other neighbors is incorporated ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in the usual symmetric form ,",
    "the self - gravitating sph acceleration equation for neutral particle @xmath83 is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the gravitational acceleration of particle @xmath83 . the ion momentum equation assuming instantaneous velocity update so that we have @xmath100 where the first term on the right - hand side gives the neutral velocity field at the ion particle @xmath48 , calculated using a standard sph approximation .",
    "the sph equivalent of the energy equation ( [ energycon ] ) is @xmath101 the temperatures of neutral particles are calculated from equation  ( [ ut ] ) , and the temperature of any ion is assumed to be same as its nearest neutral neighbor .",

    "this feature may be responsible for the planet formation in the intermediate parts of a collapsing molecular cloud and/or may also be liable for the formation of star forming dense cores in the clumps .",

    "<S> the results show that the thermal instability may persist inhomogeneities with a large density contrast at the intermediate parts of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this feature may be responsible for the planet formation in the intermediate regions of a collapsing molecular cloud and/or may also be relevant to the formation of star forming dense cores in the clumps . </S>"
