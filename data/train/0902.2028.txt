    "recent years have witnessed great development of laser cooling and optical trapping technology , with a remarkable achievement being the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum gases realized by tightly confining the particle motion in the other two directions to zero point oscillation gorlitz , moritz , paredes , kinoshita , tolra , olshanii . meanwhile",
    "the feshbach resonance may be used to manipulate the interparticle scattering length by simply tuning an external magnetic field , which enables us to explore the cold atomic gases in the full interaction regime from weakly to strongly interacting limit . in particular ,",
    "a quasi-1d quantum gas of strongly interacting bosons has been observed in the so - called tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "mixture of quantum degenerate gases form novel quantum many - body systems with rich phase structures .",
    "particularly interesting systems are the bose - fermi mixtures @xcite , which rarely occur in nature and have become experimentally accessible with the development of sympathetic cooling jin , truscott .",
    "theoretical investigations on the quasi-1d bose - fermi mixture have focused on their phase diagrams and ground - state properties in the scheme of luttinger liquid theory @xcite and bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy of a 1d system of bosons with repulsive delta - function interaction was first calculated by lieb and lininger lieb .",
    "yang and yang extended this bethe ansatz method to finite temperature 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the yang - yang thermodynamic formalism , also known as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) , allows to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of the 1d system .",
    "it has triggered numerous further investigations and has been generalized later to spin-1/2 fermions @xcite , mixture of spin-1/2 fermions and bosons @xcite , and two - component bosons @xcite , etc .",
    "the first direct comparison between experiments and theory based on the yang - yang exact solutions was carried out last year @xcite in the weakly interacting bose gas on an atom chip and for a wide parameter range where conventional models fail to quantitatively describe in situ measured spatial density profiles . in view of the experimental progress",
    ", it is thus quite desirable to study theoretically the thermodynamic properties of the quasi-1d bose - fermi mixture , which might provide theoretical guidance on the potential experimental implementation . from pure theoretical point of view",
    ", it is also very interesting to study how robust of the bose - fermi phase separation , which was predicted to appear in the limit of zero temperature imambekov , against the temperature effect .    in this paper , we combine the tba and local density approximation ( lda ) to study the density distribution of a mixture of bosons and polarized fermions trapped in a harmonic trap at finite temperature .",
    "here we have the temperature , particle number of bosons and fermions , and the interaction strength as variables .",
    "we find that the observation of bose - fermi phase separation requires even lower temperature attainable by present cooling techniques .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we rederive the thermodynamic bethe ansatz solution by means of yang - yang thermodynamic formalism for bose - fermi mixture where both bosons and fermions are spin polarized .",
    "section iii describes our numerical procedure on how to numerically evaluate the density distribution of bosons and fermions in a harmonic trap at finite temperature .",
    "we treat in a different way for radially and axially excited states . finally in section iv",
    ", we analyze the low temperature behavior of the 1d bose - fermi mixture for realistic experimental situation and make concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we study a 1d interacting bose - fermi mixture on a line of length @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions , described by the hamiltonian @xmath1where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are field operators for a boson of mass @xmath4 and for a fermion of mass @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are boson - boson and boson - fermion interaction strengths , respectively .",
    "fermions are spin - polarized so that pauli principle excludes their @xmath8-wave interaction ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this model is exactly solvable for equal masses and equal repulsive boson  boson and boson  fermion interaction strengths , i.e. @xmath10although an exact solution is available only under conditions ( condition ) , deviations slightly from this integrable line are expected not to dramatically change the characteristic properties of the system , e.g. , the phase separation . following lai - yang s original convention , we assume @xmath11 and @xmath12 and write the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) in its first quantization form@xmath13with @xmath14 . among the @xmath15 particles there are @xmath16 bosons and the rest of them are fermions .",
    "the many - body wave function is supposed to be symmetric under odd permutations with respect to indices @xmath17 ( bosons ) and antisymmetric with respect to @xmath18 ( fermions ) .    for periodic boundary conditions , imambekov and demler obtained the following set of bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) @xcite@xmath19@xmath20where the momenta @xmath21 are a set of unequal numbers , and spectral parameters @xmath22 are the analogs of the momenta .",
    "it has also been proved that all solutions of ( [ ba1]-[ba2 ] ) are always real , which simplifies greatly the analysis at finite temperature .    for thermodynamics at finite temperature we use the bae to derive a set of nonlinear integral equations , i.e. tba equations , which describes the thermodynamics of the model at finite temperature .",
    "taking logarithm of the bae ( [ ba1]-[ba2 ] ) , we arrive at the following discrete bethe ansatz equations @xmath23with @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are integer or half integer quantum numbers ( depending on the parity of @xmath16 and @xmath15 ) , which play the role of quantum numbers for the momentum @xmath27 and spectral parameter @xmath28 respectively . for a particular configuration , if an arbitrary quantum number is chosen , it is either occupied ( in the set of quantum numbers for the system ) , called a root , or not occupied , called a hole . in the thermodynamic limit ,",

    "the numbers of fermions and bosons are kept to be constants respectively .",
    "it can be proved rigorously that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the chemical potentials of fermions and bosons , respectively .    applying the minimum condition @xmath43 gives rise to the following nonlinear integral equations , i.e. tba equations@xmath44where we have defined@xmath45and the set of equations ( [ constraint ] ) becomes@xmath46the density functions @xmath29 and @xmath47 can be obtained by solving the above coupled integral equations ( [ tba_nonlinear ] ) and ( [ ba_linear ] ) .",
    "the tba approach described here is universal for discussing the thermodynamics of 1d integrable model .",
    "once @xmath48 and @xmath41 are determined , all thermodynamic properties are known .",
    "for instance , the pressure and the free energy are @xmath49",
    "starting from the solution to the tba equations derived above for a uniform 1d bose - fermi mixture in thermal equilibrium , in this section we aim to find the numerical results for the finite - temperature density distributions of bosons @xmath50 and fermions @xmath51 under the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "firstly we describe our iteration process in solving the tba integral equations . due to the fact that the tba equations are",
    "a set of coupled nonlinear integral equations there exist no closed analytical solutions for them .",
    "nonetheless , numerically this is in principle a well controllable problem ( it becomes , however , quite complex for an increasing number of particle types ) and we here solve the equations by iteration .",
    "the convergence of this procedure to a solution and its very existence have been investigated most naturally by means of the banach fixed point theorem fring .",
    "the iteration process is as follows . for given @xmath48 and @xmath41",

    "the scheme continues with updates to @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 . when the relative error between @xmath58 and @xmath61 and that between @xmath59 and @xmath62 reach a small quantity , e.g. , @xmath63 , sufficient convergence is obtained and @xmath64 and @xmath59 are considered as the solutions of tba equations .",
    "we then put these solutions into equations ( [ ba_linear ] ) , and meanwhile the initial trial density functions @xmath29 and @xmath31 is set as @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively . with the same iteration process , we can obtain the solution of equations ( [ ba_linear ] ) , the integration of which gives the particle density . note that , to insure the accurateness of the integration in the equations ( [ tba_nonlinear ] ) and ( ba_linear ) for very small interaction strength @xmath67 , the integrand should be divided into more parts with interpolation method firstly and then integrated numerically .",
    "experimentally 1d gases are usually achieved by trapping the atoms in a tight harmonic trap with strong transverse confinement and weak confinement along the axis , @xmath68 .",
    "the main parameters from the experiment @xcite on yang - yang thermodynamics of @xmath69rb atoms in the @xmath70 hyperfine state are adopted here .",
    "the bose - fermi mixture is trapped in a harmonic potential with @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the numerical procedure is as follows : the total linear density relies on two contributions , i.e. that from the radial ground state and that from the radially excited states .",
    "the density of atoms populated in the radial ground state is obtained by solving the tba equation , while the atoms in the radially excited states are treated _ discretely _ as an independent ideal 1d bose(fermi ) gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is because our temperature here is on the order of the radial level splitting , @xmath73 , so that the fraction of the atoms in radially excited states should not be neglected . along the axis , the energy level splitting , @xmath74 is so small that we can use the lda to account for the axial potential via a _ continuously _ varying chemical potential @xmath75 . in this way",
    ", we obtain the total linear densities of bosons @xmath76 and fermions @xmath77 in the magnetic trap which may be used to fit the experimental data from absorption images .    for the radial ground state",
    ", the tba equations for uniform gas can be applied locally to the trapped gas if the condition for the lda are met .",
    "one assumes that in slowly varying external harmonic trap the chemical potentials of bosons and fermions are changed into@xmath78here , @xmath41 and @xmath40 are chemical potentials for bosons and fermions in the center of the harmonic trap . replacing the chemical potentials in eqs .",
    "( [ tba_nonlinear ] ) by their lda  values , we can obtain numerically the density functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 by iteratively solving the tba equations ( [ tba_nonlinear ] ) together with the constraint ( [ ba_linear ] ) .",
    "the integration of these density functions yields the axial density distributions @xmath81for bosons  and @xmath82for fermions , which are the lda revisions to their uniform counterparts , i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ particle number ] ) .",
    "similar strategies are applied to acquire the densities of bosons and fermions at the radially excited states . for bosons",
    "it can be expected that the interaction will significantly affect only the distribution in the radial ground state , while the population in the radially excited states can be well described by the distribution of ideal bose gas .",
    "fermions in the ground state do not interact with each other due to the pauli exclusive principle .",
    "thus for fermions , the chemical potential @xmath40 can be even larger than @xmath83 , with the population in the radially excited states described by the distribution of ideal fermi gas .",
    "the radially excited states are ( @xmath84)-fold degenerate , i.e. for each radial quantum number @xmath85 there are @xmath84 excited states sharing the same energy .",
    "we treat each excited state as an independent ideal 1d bose or fermi gas in thermal equilibrium with the chemical potential of the gas in the radial ground state given by @xmath86respectively .",

    "also shown are the ideal bose - gas profile and that from a mean field theory in the thomas - fermi approximation with the same peak density.,width=336 ]    here , as an example which is experimentally accessible , we show the linear density of atomic clouds with 3d scattering length @xmath90 equal to @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is bohr radius ) and the mass of the atoms , both boson and fermion , being chosen as that of @xmath69rb .",
    "fermi mixture have not attracted much attention until recently , when it became possible to realize such systems in experiments with cold atoms @xcite .",
    "experimentalists care more about the heteronuclear bose - fermi mixture , such as @xmath69rb-@xmath93k , in which case the heteronuclear interactions can be tailored by means of feshbach resonances .",
    "bose - fermi mixture system , however , may be composed of isotopes of atoms whose mass difference is very small , such as @xmath94li@xmath95li , or @xmath96rb-@xmath69rb , etc .",
    "the exactly solvable case considered here is relevant to current experiments , and can be used as a benchmark to check the validity of different approaches .",
    "we first consider the weakly interacting mixture with the effective 1d coupling strength expressed through the 3d scattering length @xmath90 as @xmath97 if @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we denote as @xmath99 the coupling strength for bare @xmath69rb background scattering which is approximately @xmath100 . in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , we show the linear density of atomic clouds for @xmath101 bosons ( black solid line ) and @xmath102 fermions ( blue dashed line ) in the magnetic trap for different temperatures . experimentally these data may be obtained by absorption imaging and integrating the atom number along @xmath103-axis . at high temperature ( @xmath104 ) ,",
    "population in excited states contribute a lot to the density and the result from yang - yang formalism for ground state is only a small fraction , hence is not visible .",
    "the yang - yang thermodynamics is clearly seen for lower temperature ( @xmath105 ) as a narrow density peak for bosons , where both the ideal - gas and the mean field distributions in the thomas - fermi approximation fail to quantitatively describe the spatial density profiles .",
    "we also find that in the weakly interacting limit the number of fermions does not affect the density profile of the bosons very much .",
    "for instance , one can hardly discern the difference in the distributions of @xmath106 bosons when we include in the mixture @xmath107 or @xmath108 fermions .",
    "this can be attributed to the relatively small number of fermions in the ground state .",
    "the interaction in the mixture , on the other hand , may be enhanced greatly by the so - called confinement induced resonances @xcite .",
    "additionally , all interactions can be tuned using available bose - fermi feshbach resonances @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 we illustrate how the bosonic density distribution will change with the increase of interaction strength . for fixed chemical potentials of bose and fermi gas ,",
    "as interactions get stronger , the density of bose gas decreases very quickly , while the density of fermi gas keeps unchanged .",
    "this can be explained as follows . in determining the density of the atomic gas ,",
    "pauli exclusive principle plays a more important role than the bose - fermi interaction @xmath109 for atoms in the ground state ( even in the strongly interacting limit ) as a result of most fermions occupying the excited states .",
    "imambekov and demler @xcite predicted the existence of the bose - fermi phase separation at very low temperature and very strongly interacting limit , i.e. the relative distribution of bosons and fermions changes with interaction and the fermi density shows strong nonmonotonous behavior for strong interactions .",
    "they firstly get the magnon energy spectrum for large @xmath110 ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 is density ) and then use the local density approximation and energy spectrum to obtain the density distribution .",
    "there is , however , no obvious signature of this phase separation in our fig .",
    "2 which is plotted for @xmath105 even for very large interaction strength .",
    "clearly the temperature smears off this many - body quantum effect . to observe the phase separation , we need further cool the atomic gas to even lower temperature . in fig .",
    "3 , we compare the density profiles for a mixture of 100 bosons and 100 fermions in the strongly interacting limit @xmath113 for different temperatures , some of which are beyond the current experimental reach .",
    "one clearly sees that the phase separation appears at @xmath114 temperatures .",
    "also shown are the zero temperature result which is obtained analytically from bethe ansatz method @xcite .    .",
    "phase separation appears at very low temperature.,width=336 ]    . in ultra - low temperature ( @xmath114 ) few bosons",
    "would populate on the radially excited states . for more fermions in the mixture , bosons in the trap center move to the edge . at slightly higher temperature ,",
    "the total density remains unchanged . here ",
    "g \" stands for density profile of atoms in the ground state.,width=336 ]    finally , let us see how the number of fermions would affect the bose density distribution . in the weakly interacting limit , we do not observe significant change in the density profile of the bosons when we change the number of fermions .",
    "however , when both the strongly interacting and ultracold conditions are met , the presence of more fermions drastically alter the density of bosons .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4(a ) the modification of bosonic density by different number of fermions .",
    "more fermions produce stronger fermi pressure , which tends to flatten the bose density when the interactions between bosons and fermions are strong .",
    "we also noticed that the ground state density ( dashed lines ) coincides almost perfectly with the total density ( solid lines ) for @xmath115 , indicating that all bosons @xmath116 occupy the radial ground state .",
    "one can see the distinction appears for even larger number of fermions , e.g. , for @xmath117 , the fattest two curves do not match each other any more .",
    "temperature again blurs the quantum effect from increasing the number of fermions , i.e. the total density remains unchanged although that of atoms in the ground state indeed decrease for more involved fermions as can be seen in fig .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the quasi-1d system of bose - fermi mixture with equal repulsion between atoms at finite temperature . for the mixture system in a harmonic trap ,",
    "we calculate the density distributions of bosons and fermions numerically by using the combination of lda and tba and treating the radially and axially excited states as discrete and continuous ones , respectively . as",
    "the typical temperature for the ultracold gas is on the order of the radial level splitting , the density of atoms populated in the radial ground state is obtained by solving the tba equation , while those in the radially excited states are treated discretely as an independent ideal 1d bose gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the density distributions of bosons and fermions are thus calculated in various experimental situations and the effects due to the interaction strength , particle numbers and temperature are discussed .",
    "our results show that the phase separation between bosons and fermions takes place at even lower temperature attainable by recent cooling techniques .",
