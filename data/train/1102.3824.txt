    "it is important to reduce the dimensions of a cell containing atomic metal vapor where the eit resonance is formed , at the same time keeping good resonance parameters .",
    "the linewidth of the eit resonance in a @xmath8-system for the case of low laser intensity is given by @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the coherence dephasing rate , with @xmath13 being the rabi frequency and @xmath14 the natural linewidth .",
    "for the case when nanometric - thin cells ( ntc ) are employed @xcite , the value of @xmath15 is highly affected by atom - wall ( cell window ) collisions ; it takes place , though less pronounced , also for sub - millimeter thin cells @xcite .",
    "it is known that a unique collision with a dielectric surface of an uncoated vapor cell is sufficient to thermalize the ground hyperfine levels , with depolarization probability @xmath16 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in order to preserve the atomic coherence in wall collisions and to detect ultra - narrow linewidths with the help of coherent processes like eit , either coated walls or admixture of a buffer gas were used @xcite . as the size of a vapor cell",
    "is reduced , the lifetime of the ground - state coherence becomes shorter because of collisions of atoms with cell windows : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the distance between windows and @xmath20 is the most probable thermal velocity ) .",
    "also the contrast of eit resonance depends strongly on @xmath12 .",
    "hence , one could expect that the eit effect would completely wash out in the case of @xmath21 @xmath22 m ( @xmath23 mhz ) .",
    "nevertheless , it was demonstrated that the eit resonance can be observed in thin cells with thickness as small as @xmath24 1 @xmath22 m @xcite .",
    "the explanation for this non - intuitive behavior is as follows : when the coupling laser is resonant with an atomic transition , only the atoms flying nearly parallel to cell windows and hence not experiencing wall collisions do contribute to the formation of the eit resonance .",

    "the wafers are cut across the @xmath31 -axis to minimize the birefringence . in order to exploit variable vapor column thickness in the range of 30 - 2000 nm , the cell is vertically wedged by placing a 2 @xmath22m - thick platinum spacer strip between the windows at the bottom side prior to gluing .",

    "the photograph of the ntc cell is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntc ] .",
    "since the gap between the windows ( i.e. the thickness of rb atomic vapor column ) @xmath19 is of the order of visible light wavelength , an interference pattern is clearly seen visualizing a smooth thickness variation from 30 nm to 2000 nm .",
    "a thermocouple tc is attached to the sapphire side arm ( sa ) at the boundary of metallic rb to measure the temperature , which determines the vapor pressure .",
    "the sa temperature in present experiment was 120 - 140  @xmath34c , while the windows temperature was kept some 20  @xmath34c higher to prevent condensation .",

    "+ earlier , it was demonstrated that there is a dramatic difference for the absorption ( and also fluorescence ) spectrum when the thickness of ntc is reduced from @xmath42 to @xmath40 , which is caused by the revival of dicke - type coherent narrowing effect .",

    "for this reason , the @xmath40 case is of a particular interest for eit resonance formation .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ]      one of the drastic differences in behavior of eit realized in ntc and in an ordinary 1 - 10 cm long cell is exhibited by the eit linewidth and amplitude dependence on the coupling laser detuning @xmath56 ( see fig .",

    ", the probe laser radiation power was increased to 1 mw .",
    "as it is seen , the increase of detuning @xmath56 from 0 to 40 and 85 mhz results in rapid broadening of eit resonance linewidth from 25 mhz to 50 and 80 mhz fwhm , correspondingly , meanwhile the eit  amplitude rapidly decreases .",
    "this behavior has the following physical explanation . for the case of an exact atomic resonance ( @xmath45 ) , mainly the atoms flying parallel to ntc windows",
    "contribute to formation of the eit resonance .",
    "the interaction time for these atoms is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the laser beam diameter ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "when the coupling laser is detuned from an atomic transition by a value of @xmath56 , only those atoms having the velocity projection @xmath61 contribute to the formation of eit , and for these atoms the flight time between the cell windows shortens with the detuning increase : @xmath62 .",
    "this causes frequent quenching collisions of atoms with the cell windows leading to the increase of @xmath50 and consequently , to strong linewidth broadening and contrast reduction of the eit resonance . for this case @xmath63",
    "can be described by a simple expression @xmath64where @xmath65 . replacing the gap thickness by a justified parameter @xmath66 , we get @xmath67 for @xmath42 . from ( [ eq : gamma_eit ] ) for @xmath68 40 and 85",
    "mhz we have @xmath69 50 and 79 mhz , correspondingly , which is in good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "we should note that measurement of eit resonance linewidth @xmath63 at large coupling laser detuning could serve as a convenient tool to study atom - window collisions and properties of window material . +",
    "this behavior completely differs from that observable in ordinary 1 - 10 cm long cell where formation of eit resonance on the wings of the doppler profile of the absorption line can lead to its narrowing @xcite as opposed to the case of ntc . + it is well known that addition of a buffer gas into 1 - 10  cm long ordinary cell improves eit resonance parameters @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results have shown that admixture of 20 torr of n@xmath25 buffer gas to rb vapor in ntc leads to decrease of eit broadening rate with the increase of @xmath56 .",
    "this is explained by substantial shortening of the mean free path of rb atoms due to rb - n@xmath25 collisions ( @xmath24 300 nm ) , which becomes less than the ntc thickness ( @xmath5 794 nm ) . however , at @xmath70 there appears undesirable supplementary broadening : rb atoms flying parallel to the ntc windows experience velocity changing collisions with n@xmath25 , change their direction and collide with the windows , which leads to the increase of @xmath15 .      in @xcite",
    "it was shown that using ntc with rb vapor of @xmath72 thickness ( @xmath73 780 nm ) , one can measure a magnetic field by splitting eit resonances formed at d@xmath25 line excitation . however , due to a small contrast of the eit resonance it was impossible to detect the splitting at smaller @xmath19 values .",
    "switching to d@xmath0 excitation allowed us to improve the eit contrast and thus to detect the splitting for @xmath27 794 nm as is shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : density ] ) and coupled to maxwell equations  @xcite . in accordance with the assumptions made , we neglect the collisional broadening of optical transitions compared to the spontaneous decay rate , the relaxation of atoms traveling out of the diameter of the laser beam .",
    "the dephasing rate of the ground - state coherence , @xmath15 , is determined in the model by the finite time of flight of atoms between the cell windows .",
    "this parameter , usually introduced into theoretical calculations as a phenomenological constant to fit the experimental data , is taken into account in the model exactly by solving the temporal density - matrix equations with proper boundary conditions for each atom separately .",

    "miniaturization of eit setup without loss of resonance characteristics is among the challenges for technological implementation of the electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "the results obtained in the present study are not intuitive , and it is worth to compare them with the relevant results presented in literature , and analysing the distinctions . in @xcite",
    "a similar setup was employed for the eit studies : two separate lasers of 1 mhz linewidth and approximately the same power were used to form the eit resonance on d@xmath0 line of rb .",

    "+ as it follows from the obtained results , the decrease of @xmath19 is compensated by an increase of rb atomic density , so that the product @xmath121 practically does not change .",
    "an important particularity of eit is the weak influence of 5p@xmath122 level broadening on the eit parameters ( in contrast , 5p@xmath122 level broadening dramatically affects the amplitude of the vsop resonance ) . the latter can allow one to form eit resonance for @xmath123 nm by increasing the density @xmath124 and improving the laser parameters ( for example , by the technique of phase - locking the coupling and probe lasers @xcite ) , realization of lock - in detection , etc .",

    "this relatively weak thickness dependence is explained by involvement of atoms with particular velocity components in eit resonance formation : when the coupling laser is resonant with the atomic transition only the atoms moving parallelly to the ntc windows contribute to the eit formation , and the quenching collisions with the windows are not essential .",
    "the situation is dramatically different when the coupling laser is detuned from the atomic transition . in this case",
    "the atoms having velocity component towards the windows are responsible for the eit , they experience collisions with the windows resulting in broadening and contrast worsening of the resonance . it is justified that with the help of the ntc with @xmath42 and for a large frequency detuning @xmath56 of the coupling laser from atomic resonance it is possible to directly reveal and evaluate the strong influence of atom - walls collisions on the eit linewidth . by changing the value of @xmath56 one can smoothly control the eit linewidth and contrast ; measurement of the eit linewidth makes it is possible to determine the atom - wall collision rate .",
    "the theoretical model well describes the observed results .",
