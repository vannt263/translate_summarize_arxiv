    "the high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) hd77581 ( vela x-1 ) consists of a b0.5  ib supergiant ( vidal et al .",
    "@xcite , jones & liller @xcite ) and an x - ray pulsar companion ( @xmath0=283s , mcclintock et al .",
    "@xcite ) in an 8.9 days orbit .",
    "pulse - timing analysis of the x - ray pulsar has resulted in the accurate determination of its orbital parameters ( nagase @xcite ) .",
    "the length of the x - ray eclipses ( watson & griffiths @xcite ) indicates that the inclination of the orbital plane is close to 90@xmath1 . also the radial - velocity curve of the supergiant companion is measured ( van paradijs et al .",
    "@xcite , van kerkwijk et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the masses of both binary components ( @xmath2 and @xmath3  m@xmath4 , 3@xmath5 limits ) can be derived .",
    "it turns out that vela  x1  is the most massive neutron star known ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although the 3@xmath5 error bar still includes the canonical neutron star mass of 1.4  m@xmath4 .",
    "evolutionary scenarios for massive binaries ( see e.g.  van den heuvel @xcite for a review ) predict that the hmxb vela  x1  originates from a 25 + 22.5 m@xmath4 binary ( cf .",
    "van rensbergen et al .",
    "when the initially most massive star ( the primary ) becomes a supergiant and starts filling its roche lobe , a phase of mass transfer occurs , rejuvenating the secondary that eventually becomes the most massive star in the system .",
    "the primary evolves into a helium star that leaves a neutron star ( or a black hole ) after a supernova explosion . when less than half of the total mass of the system is lost , the system ( now containing an ob star and a compact companion ) remains bound ( blaauw @xcite ) and gets a kick velocity .",
    "the binary system then leaves the location where it was born .",
    "as soon as the secondary ob star evolves into a supergiant , accretion of its dense stellar wind onto the compact star will power a strong x - ray source .",
    "thus , according to this model of massive binary evolution , all hmxbs should be runaways .",
    "zwicky ( @xcite ) and blaauw ( @xcite ) were the first to realize that a supernova explosion of one of the binary components can result in a high space velocity of the companion star .",
    "this mechanism for the formation of ob - runaway stars is presently known as blaauw s scenario . in the original scenario a phase of mass transfer was not included , so that the massive binary had a higher probability to disrupt after the supernova explosion of the primary .",
    "but the modern version of this scenario predicts that the resulting runaway star has a high probability to remain bound to its compact companion ( van den heuvel @xcite , hills @xcite ) .",
    "although many people expect that a significant fraction of ob  runaways has a compact companion , searches for compact stars around ob  runaways have up to now not been successful ( e.g.  philp et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    as a result of a phase of mass transfer in a compact binary",
    ", one might expect that the abundances of nuclear processed elements are enhanced in the atmosphere of an ob - runaway star .",
    "also , the angular momentum associated with the accreted material will increase the rotation rate of the ob runaway . for a small sample of bright ob runaways , blaauw ( @xcite ) shows that these stars indeed exhibit a tendency towards higher helium abundance and higher projected rotational velocity .",
    "he further argues that some ob runaways seem to be younger than the age of the ob association they originate from ( these stars are called blue stragglers ) .",
    "these observations provide , however , only circumstantial evidence for the supernova origin of ( some ) ob runaways .",
    "an alternative explanation for the existence of ob - runaway stars is the cluster ejection model ( poveda et al .",
    "@xcite ) : dynamical interaction in a compact cluster of stars results in the ejection of one or more of the members . from their extensive radial velocity survey of bright ob - runaway stars , gies & bolton ( @xcite ) concluded that the cluster ejection model should be favoured .",
    "their conclusion is mainly based on arguments refuting a supernova origin for the observed ob - runaway stars .",
    "apart from the lack of observational evidence for the presence of compact companions around ob runaways , the existence of 2 runaway double - lined spectroscopic binaries can not be explained with the supernova model",
    ". also the kinematical age of ob - runaway stars ( i.e.  the time needed to reach its present position with respect to the `` parent '' ob association ) is often close to the age of the ob association itself , which is in support of the cluster ejection model .",
    "on the basis of the observed radial velocities they argued that the population of hmxbs and ob - runaways appears to be different .",
    "van oijen ( @xcite ) , however , found strong indications that hmxbs are high velocity objects",
    ".    in the following we will provide compelling observational evidence that at least one hmxb is an ob  runaway system , that obtained its high space velocity through the supernova explosion of the compact star s progenitor .",
    "kinematic studies of ob stars are hampered by the large distances at which these stars are usually found , making it very difficult to measure proper motions accurately ( although this situation will be significantly improved after release of the hipparcos data ) .",
    "but it turns out that many ob stars with high space velocity create an unmistakable sign in the surrounding space .",
    "when an ob  star moves supersonically through the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the interaction of its stellar wind with the ism gives rise to a bow shock .",
    "van buren & mccray ( @xcite ) examined the infra red astronomical satellite ( iras ) all - sky survey at the location of several ob - runaway stars and found extended arc - like structures associated with many of them .",
    "the infrared emission results from interstellar dust that is swept up by the bow shock and heated by the radiation field of the ob  star . in a subsequent study ( van buren et al .",
    "@xcite ) , wind bow shocks were detected around one - third of a sample of 188 candidate ob - runaway stars .",
    "thus , the detection of a wind bow shock can be considered as an observational confirmation of the runaway status of an ob  star .    to this aim",
    ", we searched for the presence of a wind bow shock around the hmxb vela  x1 .",
    "this is a good candidate for an ob  runaway system .",
    "its runaway nature was proposed in a recent paper by van  rensbergen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , based on the observed annual proper motion of hd77581 listed in the hipparcos input catalogue ( turon et al .",
    "@xcite , see table  1 ) .",
    "the direction of the annual proper motion suggests that hd77581 might originate from the ob  association vel  ob1 , which is located at a distance of 1820 parsec ( humphreys @xcite ) from the sun . at that distance , hd77581 (",
    "vela  x1 ) would have a space velocity of about 90  km  s@xmath6  and would have left vel  ob1 @xmath7 million years ago .",
    "they further showed that this kinematical age is consistent with the predicted time of supernova explosion of vela  x-1 s progenitor .",
    "figure  1 ( plate  x ) shows a narrow - band h@xmath8  image of a @xmath9 arcminute - squared field centered on vela  x1 , obtained with the 1.54 m danish telescope at the european southern observatory ( eso ) on february 14 , 1996 .",
    "the bright star hd77581 ( v=6.9 ) has been removed ( including its reflections ) from the h@xmath8  frame ( exposure time 20 minutes ) by subtracting a properly scaled r - band image of the same field .",
    "the uncalibrated h@xmath8  image clearly reveals the presence of a bow shock , the apex being at @xmath10 arcminute to the north of hd77581 . at the distance of hd77581 ( see below ) , this corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath11 parsec . with help of the flux - calibrated long - slit spectrum ( see fig .  2 ) and knowledge of the position and dimensions of the slit , we estimate ( within a factor of two ) the image peak h@xmath8 intensity to be @xmath12 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath13  arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "the western ( right ) part of the bow shock consists of two separate filaments . obviously , one filament is the continuation of the bow shock to the west .",
    "filamentary structure has been observed in other wind bow shocks as well and might be related to their instability ( dgani et al .",
    "the iras small - scale structure catalogue ( helou & walker @xcite ) lists an extended infrared source at the position of vela  x1 .",
    "the extended source can be identified as an h  ii region with a strmgren radius of @xmath15 degrees ( @xmath16 parsec ) .",
    "we produced a high - resolution iras map ( not shown here ) of this area on the sky and found that inside the h  ii region the bow shock is well resolved at infrared wavelengths too , most pronounced in the 60@xmath17 m wavelength band .",
    "the structure of a wind bow shock is determined by the balance between the ram pressures of the wind and the ambient medium ( baranov et al .",
    "@xcite ) . one can show that : @xmath18 using the observed value for the distance @xmath19 between the ob  star and the stagnation point ( apex ) , the mass - loss rate @xmath20 m@xmath4  yr@xmath6 and terminal velocity @xmath21 km  s@xmath6  of the stellar wind of hd77581 ( kaper et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and 90 km  s@xmath6  for the space velocity @xmath22 of the system , we derive for the density of the ambient medium : @xmath23  g  @xmath24 ( number density @xmath25 @xmath24 ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the local ism density can be obtained from the size of the h  ii region and also from its observed infrared flux .",
    "following osterbrock ( @xcite ) and assuming that the h  ii region is a pure hydrogen nebula , optically thick in the lyman series , a strmgren radius of 7 parsec and a black - body input spectrum ( @xmath26=20.000  k ) results in a neutral hydrogen number density @xmath27 of 6  @xmath24 . the total ir flux produced by dust inside the h  ii region is a measure for the number of ly@xmath8 photons produced by recombinations .",
    "the flux observed by iras ( integrated over the h  ii region and corrected for the iras band widths ) is @xmath28 erg @xmath13 s@xmath6",
    ". a black - body fit to the flux values shows that the dust temperature is 78  k and that the total dust emission is @xmath29 erg @xmath13 s@xmath6 , about 1.7 times the flux detected by iras .",
    "the energy per second per unit volume produced by recombination to the ground level is @xmath30 erg @xmath24 s@xmath6 .",
    "comparison with the measured ir flux gives @xmath31  @xmath13 .",
    "if the emission from the bow shock is excluded , this yields @xmath32  @xmath13 .",
    "given the uncertainties , the estimate of the local ism density with help of the bow shock and stellar wind parameters is probably the most accurate .",
    "we obtained a long - slit spectrum of the bow shock with the eso 1.52 m telescope on the night of may 28 , 1995 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we show a flux - calibrated spectrum for two regions covered by the slit ; the orientation and position of the slit is indicated in the sub - panel .",
    "the spectra include the h@xmath8  and h@xmath33 lines , and forbidden emission lines like @xmath344959,5007  and @xmath356583   .",
    "region a corresponds to the secondary filament which appears to produce the maximum h@xmath8 intensity .",
    "the h@xmath8/h@xmath33 ratio in region a is 6.5 ; if this large ratio is due to extinction , e(b - v ) would be equal to 0.72 , which is consistent with the reddening of hd77581 ( sadakane et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in region",
    "b , which covers a part of the wind bow shock , the balmer lines are much weaker with respect to the forbidden lines ( @xmath355007/h@xmath33 @xmath36 ) than in region a ( @xmath37 ) . compared to other usual shock - excited emission lines ,",
    "the lines originate close to the shockfront where the ionization conditions depend critically on shock conditions ( dopita @xcite , hollis et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "the spectra are in accordance with both regions being part of the wind bow shock .",
    "the filament covered by region a might be experiencing a somewhat weaker shock , yielding a much larger emission measure in h@xmath8 .",
    "the present position of hd77581 and the ob  association vel  ob1 is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the separation between the two is about 7 degrees .",
    "the direction of the proper motion of hd77581 , ( a ) as listed in the hic and ( b ) as measured by sahu ( @xcite ) , is indicated .",
    "the dotted line represents the proposed path of hd77581 based on the symmetry - axis of the bow shock , which is in a direction in between the proper motion vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the bow shock reflects the relative motion between the star and the surrounding medium , while the proper motion measures the star s motion with respect to other stars .",
    "since the gas has a 10 km  s@xmath6  dispersion , @xmath40 deviations can be expected , which would favour @xmath39 .",
    "if the proposed path is correct , the origin of the binary system would be on the outskirts of vel  ob1 .",
    "the usually adopted distance towards vela  x1  of @xmath41  kpc ( sadakane et al .",
    "@xcite ) is in accordance with the stellar parameters of hd77581 .",
    "the accretion induced x - ray luminosity of vela  x1  ( kaper et al .",
    "@xcite ) , also agrees very well with the distance towards vel  ob1 .",
    "thus , our observations confirm the proposed runaway status of hd77581 and support its suggested origin in vel  ob1 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the discovered wind bow shock around vela  x1  provides compelling observational evidence for a runaway high - mass x - ray binary .",
    "the direction of motion of the system is derived from the symmetry of the bow shock and it is very likely that the ob association vel  ob1 is the origin of the system . from the observed proper motion one can compute that the system left the outskirts of vel  ob1 about 2.5 million years ago , which corresponds to the expected time of the supernova explosion of vela  x-1 s progenitor .",
    "therefore , our observations support blaauw s scenario for the formation of the runaway high - mass x - ray binary hd77581 ( vela  x1 ) .",
    "it remains to be shown whether all hmxbs are runaway systems .",
    "we predict that the answer to this question is positive and expect that in at least a third of the cases a wind bow shock is associated with them .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained at the european southern observatory in la silla , chile .",
    "we thank j.  bergeron , l.  lucy and j.  van paradijs for carefully reading the manuscript .",
    "g.  van de steene produced the black - body fit to the observed iras fluxes .",
