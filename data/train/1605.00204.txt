    "we study the _ energy - distortion tradeoff _ ( edt ) for the transmission of a correlated pair of gaussian sources over a two - user gaussian broadcast channel ( gbc ) with noiseless causal feedback , referred to as the gbcf .",
    "edt , recently proposed for the multiple - access channel ( mac ) and the point - to - point channel in @xcite , characterizes the minimum energy - per - source sample required to achieve a target distortion pair at the receivers , without constraining the source - channel bandwidth ratio . in many practical scenarios , e.g. , satellite broadcasting @xcite ,",
    "sensor networks measuring physical processes @xcite , and in particular wireless body - area sensor networks @xcite , an extremely high energy efficiency is required for broadcasting correlated observations , while the available power is limited .",
    "it follows that there is a strong motivation for studying the edt for broadcasting correlated sources , and in the present work we focus on edt for feedback - assisted scenarios , represented by the gbcf .",
    "it is well known that , for lossy source transmission over memoryless gaussian point - to - point channels , with or without feedback , when the bandwidth ratio is fixed and the average power per channel use is limited , separate source and channel coding ( sscc ) achieves the minimum possible average distortion ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) it is further shown that sscc is optimal in the edt sense as well : for any target distortion level , the minimal transmission energy is achieved by optimal lossy compression followed by the most energy efficient channel coding .",
    "in contrast to the point - to - point setting , in multi - user scenarios joint design of the source and channel codes can improve the performance @xcite .",
    "however , we have a relatively limited understanding of the impact of feedback on joint source - channel coding ( jscc ) over multi - user channels . the work @xcite presented several achievability schemes and a set of necessary conditions for losslessly transmitting a pair of discrete and memoryless correlated sources over a mac with feedback .",
    "lossy transmission of correlated gaussian sources over a two - user gaussian mac with feedback was studied in @xcite , in which sufficient conditions as well as necessary conditions for the achievability of a mean square error ( mse ) distortion pair were derived . while @xcite considered only source - channel coding with a unit bandwidth ratio , @xcite studied the edt for the transmission of correlated gaussian sources over a two - user gaussian mac with and without feedback , when the bandwidth ratio is not restricted .",
    "previous works on gbcfs mainly studied the channel coding aspects which applies to independent and uniformly distributed messages @xcite@xcite .",
    "jscc of correlated gaussian sources over gbcfs was also studied in @xcite , in which the minimal number of channel uses required to achieve a target mse distortion pair was characterized for three linear encoding schemes , using uncoded transmission : the first scheme is a jscc scheme based on the coding scheme of ozarow and leung @xcite , to which we shall refer as the _ ol scheme _ ; the second scheme iss a jscc scheme based on the linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) coding scheme of @xcite , to which we shall refer as the _ lqg scheme _ ; and the third scheme iss a jscc scheme whose parameters are obtained using dynamic programming ( dp ) .",
    "we note that the advantages of linear and uncoded transmission , as implemented in the ol and lqg schemes , include a low computational complexity , low coding delays , and low storage requirements . in the present work",
    "we analyze lossy source coding over gbcfs using sscc and jscc broadcasting schemes based on a different performance metric  the edt .",
    "* _ main contributions _",
    ": * this is the _ first _ work towards characterizing the edt in gbcfs .",
    "we derive lower and upper bounds on the minimum energy required to achieve a target mse distortion pair when transmitting a pair of gaussian sources over a two - user gbcf , without constraining the number of channel uses per source sample .",
    "the proposed lower bound is based on cut - set arguments , and the upper bounds are obtained using three transmission schemes : two sscc schemes and an uncoded jscc scheme . the first sscc scheme _",
    "jointly _ compresses the two source sequences into a single bit stream , and transmits this stream using a channel code , designed for the transmission of a common message .",
    "the second sscc scheme _",
    "separately _ encodes each source sequence into two distinct bit streams , and then transmits the resulting two bit streams via the lqg channel code of @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , in terms of the minimum energy per bit , the lqg code provides no gain compared to orthogonal transmission , from which we conclude that the first sscc scheme , which jointly compresses the sequences into a single stream , is more energy efficient .",
    "as both sscc schemes apply coding over multiple samples of the source pairs , they require a high computational complexity , long delays , and large storage . thus , motivated by the low computational complexity , short coding delay , and small storage requirements of the uncoded ol scheme presented in @xcite",
    ", we use this scheme to obtain a third upper bound on the edt .",
    "numerical results indicate that the sscc scheme based on joint compression achieves a better edt compared to the jscc ol scheme ; yet , in many scenarios the gap is quite small .",
    "moreover , in many applications there is a constraint on the maximal allowed latency . in such scenarios , coding over large blocks of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "pairs of source samples introduces unacceptable delays , and instantaneous transmission of each observed pair of source samples via the proposed jscc - ol scheme may be preferable in order to satisfy the latency requirement , while maintaining high energy efficiency .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the problem formulation is detailed in section [ sec : probform ] .",
    "bounds on the minimum energy are derived in section [ sec : lowerbound ] .",

    "while the considered schemes have simple code constructions , analyzing their edt performance analysis is challenging .",
    "sscc in multi - user scenarios carries the advantages of modularity and ease of integration with the layered network architecture . in this subsection",
    "we analyze the edt of two sscc schemes : the first scheme takes advantage of the correlation between the sources and ignores the correlation between the noise components .",
    "the second scheme ignores the correlation between the sources and aims at utilizing the correlation between the noise components .",
    "this scheme utilizes the correlation between the sources by first _ jointly encoding the two source sequences _ into a",

    "this step gives rise to the rate - distortion function stated in ( 4b ) .",
    "the resulting bit stream is then encoded via an optimal channel code for sending a common message over the gbc ( without feedback ) , and is transmitted to both receivers .",
