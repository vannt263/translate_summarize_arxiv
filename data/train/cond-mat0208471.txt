    "one of the theories devised to bridge the conceptual gap between these complementary approaches is the _ hierarchical reference theory _ ( ) first put forward by parola and reatto @xcite : in this theory the introduction of a cut - off wavenumber @xmath2 inspired by momentum space  theory and , for every value of @xmath2 , of a renormalized potential @xmath3 means that only non - critical systems have to be considered at any stage of the calculation ; consequently , integral equations may successfully be applied to every system with @xmath4 , and critical behavior characterized by non - classical critical exponents is recovered only in the limit @xmath5 .",

    "nevertheless , in the light of s high promise and low penetration into the liquid physics community , further study and critical assessment of this theory seem worthwhile , even and foremost in the case of simple one - component fluids : indeed , it is in this comparatively simple setting that we may gain important insights into the numerical side of the theory , and barring special mechanisms relevant to some specific model system only , any problems uncovered here must be expected to haunt more advanced applications of , too . in our work",

    "yet another motivation for this first application of  to square wells comes from a recent , very accurate simulation study @xcite confirming and quantifying the presence in the system with @xmath23 of the yang - yang ( yy ) anomaly expected and experimentally found for asymmetric fluids @xcite .    due to the extensive amount of data available in the literature the more recent of which",
    "will shortly be presented later on , and in view of some of the limitations of  in its current formulation we can not expect to gain new insight into the system at hand with a level of precision comparable to that of the more sophisticated simulation schemes .",

    ", for a potential as pronouncedly short - ranged as square wells some of the numerical problems should show up much more prominently than in other systems like , _ e.  g. _ , the hard - core yukawa fluid previously considered @xcite where they are , of course , in principle still present but do not manifest themselves as clearly .    in accordance with the preceding remarks , another reason why application of  to square wells might be worthwhile lies in the closure underlying seemingly all applications so far of  to simple one - component fluids with hard sphere reference part : as the usual formulation of  in these cases relies on an _ ansatz _ for the two - particle direct correlation function @xmath24 very much in the spirit of stell s _ lowest - order @xmath25-ordered approximation _ @xcite ( ) or the equivalent _ optimized random - phase approximation",

    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , exist , which is obviously at variance with the correct behavior near the critical point @xcite ; furthermore , at intermediate @xmath2 the direct correlation function can hardly be considered satisfactory , especially @xcite close to @xmath31 .",
    "while some earlier publications @xcite already blamed unsatisfactory aspects of results on this inadequacy of the closure , square wells should bring out related problems of  with the usual /-style closure much more clearly , and the numerical procedure s response should provide us with a signature to be looked out for in other systems , too ; also , even within the /-style approximation the implementation of the core condition _",
    "via_approximate ordinary differential equations ( s ) for the relevant expansion coefficients easily shown to be inadequate for very short - ranged potentials @xcite casts some doubt on the range of @xmath0 values amenable to an  treatment in the current formulation of the theory .",
    "determination of the admissible @xmath0-range , on the other hand , is particularly interesting in the light of refs .",
    "and as well as in view of the global renormalization scheme @xcite originally developed by white and co - workers as an extension of wilson s phase - space cell method @xcite to the liquid state ; it is only by combining tests internal to the theory and comparison with data available by other means that we are able to answer this question .    in this contribution , after a sketchy presentation of the underlying theory itself ( section  [ sec : theory ] ) and the implementation used ( section  [ sec : program ] ) , in section  [ sec : application ] we turn to the results of applying  to square well systems of variable range . after a short summary of the critical point s location as obtained from simulation - based and other purely theoretical studies of square wells for various values of @xmath0 ( sub - section [ sec : non - hrt ] ) we first look into the core condition s implementation , which provides us with a first hint regarding the range of @xmath0 values accessible to  in its current formulation and once more highlights the decoupling assumption s _ rle _ ( sub - section [ sec : cc ] ) .",
    "the latter is also implicated in the correct choice of the boundary condition imposed at high density as discussed , alongside the boundary condition s location s effect , in sub - section  [ sec : boundary ] .",
    " a particularly grave aspect of s numerical side is the stiffness of the partial differential equation ( ) for close - to - critical and sub - critical temperatures ( sub - section  [ sec : stiff ] ) , the vestiges of which are evident in the results obtained for quasi - continually varying @xmath0 as presented in sub - section  [ sec : interference ] .",

    "the calculation proceeds _ via _  mathematically inconsistent or conflicting approximations ; in the case of square wells with their comparatively short potential range , however , the problems are much more severe than in other systems so that @xmath125 is rather small and even drops below @xmath137 for most of the @xmath0 interval from 1 to 2 ( cf .",

[ fig : rhomax ] , very small @xmath93 may also allow one to reach @xmath156 at higher @xmath120 , thus effectively raising @xmath125 while lowering @xmath122 .",
    " sometimes , however , the expectation of the binodal keeping a separation from the boundary of several @xmath118 at least does not hold , and a preposterous two - phase region appears very close to @xmath93 or , very rarely , close to @xmath92 ; _",
    "e.  g. _ , for @xmath177 and @xmath178 the equations can be solved all the way down to @xmath179 , predicting an unrealistic two - phase region extending from @xmath180 to @xmath181 .",

    "e.  g. _ , @xmath182 , thus rendering finite differences numerically insignificant .",
    "consequently , in this respect we have to give up our strategy of controlling the numerical procedure so as to locally ensure a quality of @xmath107 at least , turning to pre - determined step sizes @xcite @xmath109 in addition to fixed @xmath118 , to which similar concerns apply @xcite ; on such a coarse mesh of @xmath57-points underlying the finite difference scheme , however , the true solution can not even be represented adequately , and the numerical approximation for @xmath81 obtained from the s discretization with these far too large step sizes can not be trusted to faithfully represent even the average behavior of @xmath81 .",
    "this inadequacy of the step sizes is reflected in various peculiarities of the solution vector obtained in the numerical procedure ; indeed , when monitoring the evolution of @xmath81 and the core condition coefficients @xmath75 , our code readily detects the plummeting step sizes necessary and signals the incompatibility of the behavior seen with the assumption of smoothness underlying finite difference schemes .",
    "another telltale sign is iterated corrector steps failure to converge when @xmath81 is large : even though implicit schemes like the one we employ @xcite are the standard treatment for stiff systems , the rapid growth of the oscillations amplitudes renders the finite difference equations themselves unstable under iteration ; only when resigning on any control of the numerical error and refraining from iterations of the corrector step do the step sizes @xmath109 chosen allow one to force advancing @xmath2 all the way to @xmath42 in remarkably many cases .",
    "also , comparison of @xmath183 as obtained with different sets of step sizes @xmath109 reveals that , for @xmath184 , the evolution of @xmath81 seen numerically is driven by the number and size of @xmath2-steps only and certainly does not correspond to an average over oscillations @xcite ; the same mechanism is also responsible for a small @xmath109-dependence of the critical temperature @xmath137 .  by the same token , due to the @xmath185- and @xmath186-terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pde : f ] ) , the s stiffness and the related problems have a direct bearing on the solution outside the coexistence region even if the numerical predictions there turn out rather insensitive to variation of parameters of the numerical procedure ; in particular , we expect a gradual but non - negligible distortion ( in addition to the effects of numerical differentiation close to the near discontinuity ) of the binodal , increasing with falling temperature .      in the light of the preceding exposition as well as of the discussion in ref .",
    "it may at first seem surprising that  in the formulation of section  [ sec : theory ] has a record of being well applicable to a variety of systems ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : intro ] ) ; also , as we shall see in a moment , even for square wells , a system expected to be particularly vulnerable to the problems just outlined , we find reasonable estimates of the critical points locations for a wide range of @xmath0-values .",

    "whereever @xmath191 the critical temperature in general compares quite favorably with the data of tables  [ tb : ref.sim ] and  [ tb : ref.theo ] ; from the calculations we have performed for a large number of systems in the range @xmath192 and ignoring some isolated results , a critical point is found for @xmath193 , for @xmath194 , and for @xmath195 ; calculations with @xmath196 yield analogous results @xcite , with @xmath191 in a somewhat larger part of the parameter range , _ viz .",

    "are generally found to be in satisfactory agreement with the @xmath200-curve expected from the simulation - based and theoretical results presented in sub - section [ sec : non - hrt ] .",
    "embedded into this regular overall behavior of @xmath137 as a function of @xmath0 , however , we find a number of depressions and elevations of @xmath137 , some of which can not be seen on the scale of the plot  [ fig : crit : lambda ] but from the numeric results only @xcite ; others , however , are so strong as to render the critical temperature a non - monotonic function of @xmath0 , which is certainly not expected on the grounds of the literature presented in sub - section  [ sec : non - hrt ] , the data of refs .   in particular .    in the light of sub - section",
    "[ sec : stiff ] it is of course tempting to simply attribute this behavior to the difficulties previously discussed , especially since the critical point is located in the region of large @xmath183 by definition ; the peculiar distribution of @xmath0-values affected , however , suggests that these problems of the numerical procedure are triggered by a special mechanism .",
    "indeed , a closer look at the core condition function @xmath201 for fixed density @xmath47 reveals , for every single one of the @xmath0 values implicated that we checked , that the combination of terms pertaining to @xmath8 or @xmath202 alone ( of ranges @xmath203 and @xmath13 , respectively ) regularly and quite frequently reduces the amplitude of this function s swings about the ideal gas value of @xmath87 ; the same happens only occasionally for @xmath0-values removed from these irregularities so that it is , in fact , possible to quite reliably determine whether or not a given @xmath0 is affected from a plot of @xmath201 for @xmath129 alone as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : c : interference ]",
    ". it will come as no surprise that most of the irregularities occur when @xmath0 , the ratio of the two characteristic lengths present in the model , is close to a simple fraction : among the shifts in @xmath187 most obvious are those where @xmath0 is close to @xmath204 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : crit : lambda : details ] ) , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , and in retrospect it seems justified to also include the small parameter range around @xmath209 in this list , _ v.  i. _ ; the effect is less obvious from fig .",

    "all these observations seem to indicate that indeed it is the interplay of the two different length scales and the resulting partial oppression of a significant portion of the oscillations of @xmath201 that cause the discrepancy of  and literature results for the critical temperature around certain @xmath0 values even though a smooth interpolation of s predictions from @xmath0 values nearby is well compatible with the data presented in sub - section  [ sec : non - hrt ] . even though we currently can not pinpoint the precise mechanism by which this unphysical behavior of arises and , in particular , can not distinguish between the closure s inadequacy and the s stiffness as the main culprit  though the latter is certainly implicated to some degree  , two conclusions may be drawn quite safely : for one , as long as we stay clear of values of @xmath1 that are close to simple fractions , or restrict ourselves to @xmath214 where the effects are rather small , we can probably trust the numerical results  with the _ caveats _ of ref .   and sub - sections  [ sec : boundary ] and  [ sec : stiff ]  to the same degree of confidence as those obtained for the hard - core yukawa system in ref .  .",
    "and secondly , it is only in the presence of discontinuities in the potential that certain lengths feature prominently in the relevant functions fourier transforms and can so give rise to problems of the kind outlined above ; consequently , as long as we confine ourselves to continuous @xmath215 , which still includes most of the potentials popular in liquid state physics , the unphysical shifts in @xmath137 seen for certain parameter combinations are likely not an issue , whereas the same problems are expected to resurface , _",
    "e.  g. _ , for the multi - step potential also defined in sub - section  iii  b  of ref .  .",
    "another lesson to be drawn from the findings presented here as well as in ref .",
    "is that , as a general rule , conclusions should never be drawn from isolated results alone ; it is only through the combination and meticulous scrutiny of a set of related calculations that meaningful information can be extracted from  calculations : due to the problems related to the implementation of the core condition , to the nature and location of the boundary conditions , and to the s stiffness , any single calculation must be considered as of uncertain standing . as an example @xcite , the analogue of fig .  [",
    "fig : rhomax ] for @xmath23 shows a considerably larger variation in the binodal and the critical point s location , which is consistent with the above conclusions regarding the reason for @xmath125 rising above @xmath137 in a narrow region around this @xmath0 value , whereas any one of the phase boundaries found in itself is a perfectly plausible candidate for the `` true ''  binodal .",
    "in conjunction with the findings of ref .  , the discussion of section  [ sec : application ] provides quite coherent a picture of s numerical side as well as of some peculiarities encountered for square wells .",
    "most prominently , we see a marked dependence of the quality of the results on the potential s range , confirming the trend of decreasing accuracy for narrower potentials reported @xcite for the hard - core yukawa fluid ; it has long been accepted @xcite that the simplistic but computationally convenient @xcite closure ( [ eq : closure ] ) has a part in this , and an improved closure has recently been proposed @xcite .",

    "but table  [ tb : ncc ] demonstrates not only the @xmath0-dependence of the results sensitivity to the number @xmath216 of basis functions retained in the truncated eq .",
    "( [ eq : cc : cint ] ) when varying @xmath217 in the range @xmath218 : while the virtually constant critical temperature predicted for @xmath143 seems trustworthy and is , indeed , well compatible with simulation results ( cf.table  [ tb : ref.sim ] ) , the amount of variation in @xmath137 for @xmath23 and , to a much lesser degree , for @xmath133 precludes accurate determination of the critical temperature ; this is a first indication that the theory might be able to handle square wells with @xmath143 quite reliably whereas problems can not be denied for @xmath133 , and @xmath23 seems largely out of reach for  in the present formulation .",
    "this is confirmed by the results obtained by quasi - continuous variation of @xmath0 in the range @xmath192 as shown , for @xmath126 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : crit : lambda ] : the critical point is accessible only in part of this parameter range , and not only the critical temperature at fixed @xmath0 but also the boundaries of the @xmath0-intervals where  is able to reach temperatures as low as @xmath187 strongly depend on @xmath74 ( cf.sub-section  [ sec : interference ] ) .",
    "applicability of  to only a restricted @xmath0-range is , of course , again related to the pronounced short - rangedness of the square well potential ; to explain it , however , we have to invoke not only the /-style closure and the approximate implementation of the core condition but also the other difficulties encountered in the numerical procedure as highlighted in this and our preceding contribution , _ viz . _  the decoupling assumption ( ref .  ) , inappropriate boundary conditions ( sub - section  [ sec : boundary ] ) and , most importantly , the s stiffness for thermodynamic states of high compressibility ( sub - section  [ sec : stiff ] ) .",
