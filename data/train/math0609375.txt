    "in this section we describe the topolgy of the spaces @xmath50 if @xmath51 are commuting elements from @xmath3 then there are @xmath15 possibilities : either @xmath51 are rotations about a common axis ; or @xmath51 are involutions about axes meeting at right angles .",

    "conversely , if @xmath62 is a path containing @xmath27 then the @xmath72 will have a common axis of rotation for all @xmath65 ( which might change with @xmath65 ) .",

    "these components are all homeomorphic to @xmath102 .",
    "thus @xmath103 is homeomorphic to the disjoint union @xmath104 where there are 7 copies of @xmath24 .",

    "these 5 cases account for all components of @xmath114 but not all choices lead to distinct components .",

    "we consider the above 5 possibilities one by one .",
    "first assume @xmath130 then different choices of the asterisks lead to different components .",
    "thus the contribution in this case is @xmath131 next assume @xmath132 then all choices for the asterisks are admissible , except for those choices involving only @xmath133 and @xmath134 this leads to @xmath135 possibilities .",
