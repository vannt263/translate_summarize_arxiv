    "the degree of polarization of faint radio sources is of astrophysical interest because it measures the regularity of magnetic fields in these radio sources . while a significant fraction of radio sources brighter than 100 mjy are luminous sources , brighter than the luminosity boundary between fri and frii radio galaxies , the radio source population around 30 mjy is dominated by radio galaxies below the fri / frii luminosity boundary . if this gradual transition to less luminous radio galaxies is accompanied by a difference in structure , as in the case of fri / frii radio galaxies , it is conceivable that the polarization properties of faint radio sources is different from those of bright radio sources . around a flux density of 1 mjy ,",
    "an increasing fraction of radio sources is powered by star formation instead of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , with a potentially significant contribution of radio - quiet qsos .",
    "the polarization properties of these objects may also be quite different from the bright radio source population studied so far .",
    "characterization of the polarization of radio sources is difficult because the polarized signal is only a few percent of the total brightness of the source .",
    "the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has detected 1.8 million sources in total intensity , but only 14% of these have a reported ( raw ) peak polarized signal greater than @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the median percentage polarization of steep - spectrum nvss sources brighter than 100 mjy increase from @xmath1 for sources brighter than 800 mjy to @xmath2 for sources between 100 mjy and 200 mjy . for fainter sources , the median polarized intensity of @xmath2 would be below the formal detection limit .",
    "fainter polarized sources exist in the nvss , but these are highly - polarized sources in the tail of the distribution .",
    "the application of the analysis presented in this paper therefore begins at the @xmath3100 mjy level in total flux density , even though a substantial fraction of the sources is still detected in polarization .",
    "the polarization of radio sources fainter than @xmath4 mjy at 1.4 ghz has been studied directly in deep fields with a high sensitivity but small survey area ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with sensitivity around @xmath5 , and a smaller field by @xcite at @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite applied forward fitting of polarized source counts for a wider but shallower ( @xmath7 ) survey to investigate the polarization of sources below the formal detection threshold .",
    "the deep fields currently provide the polarization data for sources fainter than @xmath8 mjy .",
    "the long integration times required to detect faint sources in polarization limit the survey area of these fields , and therefore the attainable sample size . published deep surveys were made with different telescopes and apply different methods for detection , which raises complications for combining results from different deep surveys . with a sample size of the order of 100 detections in polarization , these deep fields can not constrain the polarization of relatively rare objects such as the flat spectrum radio sources considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this limitation is a strong driver for the large collecting area and large instantaneous bandwidth of the international square kilometre array ( ska ) telescope ( http://skatelescope.org ) . in anticipation of future wide and deep polarization surveys , we explore stacking polarized intensity to derive polarization properties of sources well below the detection limit of current surveys .",
    "stacking is a statistical approach to derive the mean or median flux density of a class of sources that can not be detected individually in a survey .",
    "if the position of a sample of sources is known , the intensities at the recorded positions can be combined by taking the average or the median . in this paper",
    "we focus on stacking radio surveys , in particular polarized intensity from the nvss .",
    "stacking was first applied to radio data by @xcite , addressing the radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy of active galactic nuclei with optically selected samples from the sdss , and radio data from the first survey @xcite .",
    "the technique has also been applied to study the infrared - radio correlation of galaxies by stacking the radio emission of galaxies with nearly the same infrared flux density @xcite .",
    "confusion is a potential problem for stacking if the source density in the reference catalogue leaves less than several beams per source in the stacked survey .",
    "the effectiveness of stacking depends further on completeness and astrometric accuracy of the input source catalog , and the degree to which the stacked survey may resolve a significant fraction of the sample . in this paper",
    "we will discuss some specific challenges related to stacking polarized intensity .",
    "stacking polarization is attractive because the polarized signal is intrinsically weak , and the total - intensity source catalogue is available to define source positions .",
    "stacking polarized intensity is therefore unique in the sense that the reference sample is derived from the same survey - in total intensity .",
    "we have performed experiments involving other radio surveys but focus here on stacking of linear polarization from the nvss for subsamples of the nvss source catalogue .",
    "we also limit the analysis to stacking polarized intensity , but we point out that stacking stokes parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 individually can be meaningful when testing for the alignment of linear polarization with source morphology , and that stacking circular polarization is another application of the procedure outlined in this paper , provided that the absolute value of stokes v is stacked .    if polarized intensity is stacked for sources in a narrow range of total flux density , the derived median polarized intensity yields a median percentage polarization for that sample .",
    "stacking linear polarization therefore allows us to investigate the fractional polarization of radio sources as a function of flux density .",
    "this in turn can be combined with total source counts to derive polarized radio source counts to very low flux densities , as a predictor for the number density of rotation measures produced by future deep polarization surveys with the ska , as done previously by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "fitting deep polarized source counts and total - intensity source counts simultaneously with models of the cosmological evolution of radio sources provides information on the relation between the cosmic evolution of magnetic field properties and radio source evolution .",
    "the main challenge of stacking polarized intensity - a positive definite quantity - is the treatment of the effects of noise . in the limit of high signal to noise ratio",
    ", a number of corrections have been proposed to correct for a small bias in the observed polarized intensity due to noise .",
    "the main reason for stacking is to explore the low signal to noise regime , where the signal at best creates a small positive bias to the noise .",
    "we discuss the effects of noise in section  [ model - sec ] and apply stacking to a simulated survey in section  [ simulation - sec ] . in section  [ nvss - sec ]",
    "we apply the same procedure to nvss images , and compare our results with the literature in section  [ discussion - sec ] . in the future",
    "we will report on polarization stacking of sub - samples selected using different surveys .",
    "polarization data used here are 1.4 ghz polarization images from the nvss that cover 80% of the sky with a mean sensitivity of 0.29 mjy beam@xmath11 in stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 images .",
    "the reference catalog for source positions is the nvss catalogue , constructed by fitting 2-dimensional gaussians to the stokes i images @xcite .",
    "the nvss catalogue is 90% complete for sources with @xmath12 , and 50% complete at @xmath13 .",
    "the rms position error is @xmath14 for sources brighter than 10 mjy , and better than @xmath15 ( rms ) for fainter sources .",
    "the original resolution of the nvss is @xmath16 ( fwhm ) .",
    "however , the nvss images were published with discretized pixel values ( allowing compression of the data ) that inhibits median stacking to a faction of the noise . instead of the published nvss images , we used the full - band images made by @xcite for our stacking experiments , with a resolution of @xmath17 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the rms confusion limit in our total intensity images is @xmath18 @xcite , corresponding with @xmath19 in polarization for a median percentage polarization of @xmath2 .    at low galactic latitude ,",
    "the nvss catalogue is significantly incomplete in extragalactic sources because of confusion with small - scale structure in diffuse galactic emission , and it is contaminated by fitting of small - scale structure and side lobes of bright sources . in some regions around the galactic plane , the nvss suffers from bandwidth depolarization @xcite .",
    "we avoided significant bandwidth depolarization related to faraday rotation by the galactic foreground by restricting our experiments to sources with galactic latitude @xmath20 .",
    "it is difficult to avoid completely the small - scale structure in stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the nvss @xcite , but we found that our conclusions do not change if the latitude cut - off is increased up to @xmath21 .",
    "the software automatically rejects sources if the local noise level is larger than a user - specified multiple of the nominal survey noise .",
    "we set this rejection threshold at 3 times the nominal noise value , resulting in a negligible number of rejections , and found that turning this rejection off completely had a negligible impact on our results .",
    "visual inspection of rejected positions confirmed that the rejection was removing poor areas in the survey , so it was maintained in the final analysis .",
    "one of the great merits of the nvss is its uniform sensitivity , which is an important advantage for stacking .",
    "the final input catalogue was divided into narrow bins of 0.05 dex in total flux density , such that stacking in polarized intensity will eventually result in a determination of median percentage polarization as a function of flux density .",
    "the stacked images were made by extracting postage stamp images of @xmath22 pixels centered on the catalogued position .",
    "we used @xmath23 with @xmath24 pixels in the original images .",
    "aligning the postage stamps to the nearest pixel creates a significant downward bias by blurring due to alignment errors in the stacked image . to minimize any blurring ,",
    "the postage stamps were aligned by oversampling each by a factor 8 , aligning , and then resampling back to the original pixel scale of the survey .",
    "this reduced any residual alignment errors to @xmath25 of the synthesized beam scale , approximately the size of the rms position errors of the reference catalogue .",
    "the noise in each postage stamp in @xmath9 and @xmath10 was determined by taking the median of the absolute value of pixels in the border of the postage stamp , covering approximately 12 independent beams .",
    "this is more robust than the rms value if another source occurs in the area . for gaussian noise with standard deviation @xmath26 ,",
    "the median of the absolute value is @xmath27 .",
    "postage stamps with noise level more than three times the typical noise of 0.29 mjy beam@xmath11 were discarded .",
    "the non - gaussian statistics of the noise in @xmath9 and @xmath10 were determined empirically from a set of 80 high - latitude mosaics , blanking out pixels with detectable stokes @xmath28 emission .",
    "we fitted a combination of a gaussian and exponential wings to describe the statistics of the noise empirically @xcite .",
    "the noise distribution was scaled for each target source to have a median absolute value equal to that measured at the border of the postage stamp . for each stack",
    "we verified that the off - source stacked polarized intensity is consistent with a set of monte - carlo realizations for zero signal within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the effectiveness of this approach is best illustrated by its performance in the stacking simulation presented in section  [ simulation - sec ] , for which we determined the noise statistics in the same way from the images .",
    "stacked images in total intensity and polarized intensity were constructed by taking the median over all remaining postage stamps for each pixel .",
    "when we discuss the median fractional polarization from stacking , we use the ratio of the median @xmath29 to the median of @xmath28 for narrow ranges of @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ stack_images - fig ] shows a sequence of stacked polarized intensity images for selected flux density ranges starting with the faintest flux density , increasing by a factor 2.5 in each step . significant polarized emission is visible in the center of each image , increasing in strength as the median total flux density increases .",
    "the angular diameter of sources in the stacked stokes i images is @xmath30 with standard deviation @xmath31 , consistent with the @xmath32 beam size of the images made by @xcite .",
    "the background in the @xmath33 images is positive , representing the polarization bias in the absence of signal .",
    "the median of the rice distribution in the absence of signal and noise of 0.29 mjy beam@xmath11 is 0.3415 mjy beam@xmath11 .",
    "the actual background level is closer to 0.365 mjy beam@xmath11 , because the noise level in the nvss q and u images is not uniform , and possibly because of non - gaussian wings of the noise distribution .",
    "we tested improvement of the noise with sample size @xmath34 by stacking randomly selected positions .",
    "figure  [ pi_random_positions - fig ] shows the rms around the mean offset level in stacked polarized intensity images at random positions . for @xmath35",
    "the rms fluctuations follow the relation @xmath36 . at",
    "higher @xmath34 , the noise in the stacked polarized intensity images decreases at a slower rate .",
    "the noise level at the break is close to the expected confusion noise level in polarization for a median percentage polarization of @xmath2 . while polarized sources at the confusion limit blend together and partially depolarize , the stacked image remains crowded with sources with a density of the sky that corresponds with a few beams per source . for our stacking result , we have no concern regarding confusion in polarization because the reference catalogue of nvss sources remains well above the confusion limit .",
    "the faintest flux density bin in our analysis contains @xmath37 sources yielding a sensitivity of 1 @xmath38jy in the stacked image .",
    "noise in polarized intensity biases the observed polarized intensity @xmath39 upward from the actual polarized intensity @xmath29 .",
    "if the signal to noise ratio is low , the relation between @xmath29 and the expectation value of @xmath40 , or the median value @xmath33 , deviates most strongly from a linear relation . following @xcite , the probability density function of the polarized intensity @xmath40 for a source with true polarized intensity @xmath29 and the same but statistically independent gaussian noise in the stokes parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the rice distribution @xcite @xmath41j_0\\bigl({i p p_0 \\over \\sigma_{qu}^2}\\bigr),\\ ] ] with @xmath42 the zeroth order bessel function , and @xmath43 the unit for imaginary numbers .",
    "consider a number of independent measurements with the same @xmath29 .",
    "this is not a realistic assumption in many stacking experiments , but it provides a helpful analytic expression and may proof to have a useful application in stacking polarized intensity for a number of subsequent frequency channels for the same source .",
    "the median @xmath33 is defined by the relation @xmath44    in the limit of low signal to noise ratio in polarization ( @xmath45 ) , we approximate the bessel function by a polynomial approximation to second order @xmath46 for @xmath47 @xcite . substituting this approximation in equation  [ median - eq ] yields an equation for the median in the case that @xmath48 . expressed in the normalized variables",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , this equation is @xmath51(1 + { 1 \\over 2 } u_0 ^ 2 + { 1\\over 4 } u_0 ^ 2 w^2 ) - { 1\\over 2 } - { 1\\over 4}u_0 ^ 2 = 0 .",

    ". for @xmath56 , equation  [ solve_median - eq ] gives an approximation for @xmath57 that deteriorates for higher values of @xmath58 .",
    "substituting @xmath59 in equation  [ median - eq ] , and approximating @xmath60 \\approx { 1 + { w^2 - w_0 ^ 2 \\over 2}},\\ ] ] solving for @xmath57 yields @xmath61    figure  [ rice_median - fig ] shows this approximate formula in comparison with the result of numerically integrating equation  [ median - eq ] .",
    "it is to be expected that the approximation deteriorates for larger @xmath58 .",
    "the difference remains within the statistical errors for samples @xmath62 with @xmath63 , for which the noise in the stacked image is more than @xmath64 .",
    "we will see later that a larger source of error is related to the fact that a real sample of sources contains a distribution of @xmath29 that is not known a priori .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ rice_median - fig ] is the line @xmath65 .",
    "its deviation from the curves illustrates that the signal in the stacked polarized intensity image is far from an addition of the source signal and the off - source median .",
    "inverting equation  [ median_est - eq ] , we obtain an estimator for the bias correction for the median polarized intensity , assuming all sources have _ the same _ @xmath66 , @xmath67    the non - linear dependence of @xmath68 on the true signal @xmath69 is evident in equation  [ median_est - eq ] .",
    "when stacking a set of sources with different values of @xmath29 , sources with higher @xmath29 contribute more strongly to raising the median of the sample .",
    "a significant range in @xmath29 is to be expected when stacking a sample of sources . considering the additional complication that the noise in a survey may not be uniform",
    ", we expect that an analytical solution as derived above leaves systematic errors that will be larger than the statistical uncertainty in the median polarized intensity of a large sample of sources .",
    "we apply monte carlo simulations to derive a median @xmath70 from the median of the stack @xmath33 .",
    "consider the stack as a sequence of observed polarized intensities @xmath71 , from sources with true polarized intensity @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "the local noise level at each source in the stack is recorded , and the effect of the noise on the @xmath71 can be simulated by a large number of monte - carlo realizations of the stack .",
    "the most likely value for @xmath70 and its errors are derived from these monte carlo simulations .",
    "a significant complication is that we can not assume that all sources in a stack have the same @xmath29 . the expectation value or the median of the observed signals @xmath71 is a non - linear function of the actual signals @xmath75 ( figure  [ rice_median - fig ] and equation  [ median_est - eq ] ) .",
    "the result of this non - linearity is that sources with higher @xmath72 in a survey with uniform noise are more effective raising @xmath33 than sources with low @xmath72 .",
    "the result of the stack therefore depends on the shape of the distribution of @xmath72 values , not just the median @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ pi_dist_sim - fig ] demonstrates the effect of different @xmath29 distributions with the same median @xmath70 .",
    "we simulated stacking of five samples of 5000 sources and uniform gaussian noise in stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 with standard deviation @xmath26 .",
    "we note that our analysis below takes into account variation of the noise and the actual noise statistics of the survey that may or may not be gaussian .",
    "the median polarized intensity of each simulation was the same at @xmath77 , but the distribution of the @xmath72 was different for each sample : all sources the same @xmath29 , a uniform distribution between @xmath78 and a maximum @xmath79 , a gaussian distribution , a gauss - hermite function @xcite with extended tail ( kurtosis parameter @xmath80 , where @xmath81 for a gaussian ) , and the distribution of @xmath82 for bright nvss sources derived by @xcite .",
    "the latter is a piecewise fit to the fractional polarization distribution for nvss sources brighter than 80 mjy .",
    "in addition , a fraction of sources is considered unpolarized . in this example , that fraction is zero .",
    "@xcite adopted 11.3% .",
    "each distribution was stacked in 2000 independent realizations in order to derive the distribution of the median - stacked polarized intensity @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting distributions of @xmath33 are shown in figure  [ pi_dist_sim - fig ] .",
    "the total polarization bias in each stack is the difference between the median of each of the distributions shown and the intrinsic median @xmath83 .",
    "although the differences between the distributions in figure  [ pi_dist_sim - fig ] are small compared with the total bias , they are significant compared with the width of each of the distributions , which is of the order of @xmath84 , with @xmath85 in this example . in order to take optimal advantage of the increased sensitivity in the stacked images , our bias correction must include the distribution of the @xmath29 .",
    "this is a higher - order correction to the derived median @xmath86 that to some degree depends on the signal to noise ratio per object .",
    "we will include a constraint to the shape of the @xmath82 distribution in our analysis below .",
    "it is worth noting that for small samples , @xmath87 , the differences between the histograms become similar to the statistical error @xmath88 . for these small samples",
    ", one can apply equation  [ p0_est - eq ] as a bias estimator .",
    "the implied delta function distribution tends to underestimate @xmath33 for a given @xmath70 compared with distributions of finite width , so this estimator is biased toward higher @xmath70 for a given @xmath89 .",
    "when stacking sources selected in a narrow range of total intensity , the distribution of @xmath29 is of the same form as the distribution of fractional polarization @xmath82 , which is at best slowly varying with flux density as the relative numbers of radio source populations change gradually with flux density .",
    "the @xmath82 distribution derived for bright sources can be used as an initial estimate for the @xmath72 distribution if the sources span a narrow range in total flux density . note",
    "that this solution works well for samples that can be binned by their stokes i flux density .",
    "when stacking targets selected at a different wavelength , such as a different radio frequency , x - ray , or optical source catalogue , an a - priori estimate for the distribution of the @xmath72 is much more complicated .    in order to proceed , an additional constraint for the _ distribution _ of the @xmath72",
    "is required .",
    "when we refer to a fixed shape of the @xmath82 distribution , we still allow for a scaling in @xmath82 that changes the median .",
    "while this is an approximation , it allows us to use prior information from brighter sources as a basis for our analysis . a constraint for the shape of the distribution is available if the number of sources @xmath34 is sufficiently large .",
    "the distribution of the observed @xmath71 values contains information about the distribution of the @xmath72 , even though it is broadened by the effects of noise .",
    "our monte carlo simulations reproduce the effect of the noise in polarized intensity for a proposed distribution of @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution of the synthesized polarized intensities including noise can be compared with the distribution of observed @xmath71 .",
    "the metric by which we decide whether the assumed distribution of @xmath72 is acceptable , is the ratio of the upper quartile to the lower quartile of the distribution of the observed @xmath71 .",
    "this ratio is still fairly robust against outliers , which is necessary when stacking real data .    for sources selected in a narrow range of total intensity",
    ", the shape of the distribution of observed @xmath40 approaches the @xmath82 distribution in the limit of high signal to noise ratio , while it approaches the distribution of the noise in the limit of no polarized signal . in between these two limiting cases",
    ", we find a transition between the two distributions that occurs over an order of magnitude in @xmath33 or more .",
    "the ratio of the upper quartile to the lower quartile of the observed @xmath40 values of the sources in the stack is sensitive to the shape of this distribution , but not to the median @xmath33 itself .",
    "it therefore provides an additional constraint to the shape of the distribution that is not sensitive to outliers , provided @xmath34 is sufficiently large .",
    "polarization bias correction proceeds as follows . for each source in the stack ,",
    "we draw a @xmath82 and polarization angle , and noise perturbations to simulate observed @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the resulting set of polarized intensities @xmath71 is stacked , retrieving @xmath33 and quartiles .",
    "repeat this @xmath93 times to define the distribution of @xmath33 for the input parameters .",
    "this procedure must be repeated for a sequence of assumed median values @xmath70 and distributions of @xmath82 until the quartile ratio matches that of the data in the stack for every flux density bin .",
    "the input parameters vary little from one flux bin to another , allowing targeted search ranges for these parameters to be defined . retrieving the @xmath82 distribution from the observed @xmath71 distribution",
    "is a deconvolution problem that can in principle be solved separately , with the result feeding back into the stacking analysis .",
    "this may be necessary if one finds that the @xmath82 distribution derived from bright sources does not reproduce the quartile ratio derived from the data at lower flux densities .",
    "the signal to noise ratio for which any particular shape can be confidently rejected or accepted in this way depends on the size of the samples .",
    "while a complete analysis of all possible shape distribitions is beyond the scope of this paper , we illustrate this further in the following sections .      in order to test the stacking and bias correction , simulated images such as",
    "the one shown in figure  [ sim_nvss - fig ] were made , that contain image artifacts and spatial variation of the noise similar to that encountered in nvss images .",
    "total flux densities in the range 0.1 mjy to 1 jy were drawn from a @xmath94 power law distribution .",
    "the percentage polarization of each source is drawn from a distribution fitted to nvss sources brighter than 80 mjy by @xcite .",
    "the inserted median @xmath95 is independent of flux density .",
    "each source is assigned an arbitrary polarization angle , dividing the polarized signal over stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 . to simulate imperfect imaging each source",
    "is added to the simulated image in a way that mimics interferometric imaging with a finite clean limit of @xmath96 mjy beam@xmath11 and a gaussian restoring beam .",
    "residual side lobes are appropriately scaled vla - d antenna patterns centered on the location of the source .",
    "these side lobes add incoherently , creating a non - gaussian noise floor after which gaussian noise modulated by the sensitivity pattern of nvss mosaics is added .",
    "we included some weight patterns of incomplete mosaics that lead to variation in the noise level around missing fields .",
    "we stacked polarized intensity following the procedure outlined above .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ sim_nvss_stack - fig ] and figure  [ sim_nvss_quartile - fig ] .",
    "each point in figure  [ sim_nvss_stack - fig ] represents a stack with its own monte carlo analysis .",
    "note that the formal errors in the median fractional polarization in figure  [ sim_nvss_stack - fig ] are smallest in the central part of the flux density range , and larger for brighter sources and for fainter sources .",
    "errors are larger for brighter sources because the sample sizes are smaller , while for fainter sources the signal to noise ratio in the stacked image decreases as the signal gets weaker , despite the larger sample size .",
    "the input median fractional polarization is recovered within the errors over the entire flux density range shown . to illustrate the magnitude of the bias correction in the fainter bins , the ratio @xmath97 is shown by the gray curve .",
    "the dotted curve shows the result of monte carlo simulations that assume a gaussian distribution of @xmath82 , which is rejected because it does not reproduce the shape of the distribution of the @xmath71 at intermediate flux densities as explained below .",
    "figure  [ sim_nvss_quartile - fig ] shows the ratio of the upper to the lower quartile of the set of @xmath71 for each of the stacks as a function of flux density ( points with error bars ) , along with a curve that shows the mean quartile ratio of the 2000 monte - carlo simulations for each stack .",
    "the shape of the curve illustrates the transition from the noise dominated regime to the signal dominated regime .",
    "the zero - signal stack reproduces the off - source values in the stacked image .",
    "recall that for sources fainter than @xmath8 mjy in the nvss , more than 50% of the sources is no longer formally detectable , leaving the median undetermined unless stacking is attempted .",
    "this analysis can not provide a unique shape for the distribution of @xmath82 , but it is sufficiently sensitive in the transition region to differentiate between a gaussian distribution and the actual non - gaussian shape of the distribution of nvss sources .",
    "the dotted curve in figure  [ sim_nvss_quartile - fig ] shows the quartile ratio for the monte carlo simulations that assumed a gaussian @xmath82 distribution .",
    "a gaussian @xmath82 distribution is rejected for sources with @xmath98 , while the distribution for bright sources consistently reproduces the quartile ratio over the entire flux density range .",
    "note that we have to assume that the shape of the distribution does not change for sources fainter than @xmath3 10 mjy .",
    "however , we do not expect the shape of the distribution to change rapidly with flux density .      for stacking nvss sources",
    ", we used the distribution fitted by @xcite , with 6% of sources completely unpolarized .",
    "the median fractional polarization of nvss sources as a function of flux density is shown in figure  [ nvss_pivsi - fig ] , and the accompanying quartile ratio in figure  [ nvss_quartile - fig ] .",
    "we find the median fractional polarization is higher for fainter radio sources .",
    "the line in figure  [ nvss_pivsi - fig ] represents the fit @xmath99 where @xmath100 is expressed as percent polarization , and @xmath101 is the 1.4 ghz flux density in mjy . we see small systematic residuals around this best fit line .",
    "while this may indicate real curvature in the relation , it may also indicate resolution effects for bright sources that are difficult to quantify .",
    "on one side , slightly resolved sources may be more highly polarized because structure in polarization angle leads to depolarization in an unresolved source . on the other side , the stacking centers at the peak of total intensity , and may miss polarized components that are offset from the peak in total intensity . a second degree polynomial fit to the data has a maximum fractional polarization of 2.4% at flux density @xmath102 , with considerable uncertainty .",

    "we conclude that the main reason for the high fractional polarization reported by @xcite is the application of an incorrect bias correction for sources with a low signal to noise ratio .",

    "@xcite fitted a double power law model of the polarized source counts to the observed distribution of @xmath71 .",
    "the model source counts are formulated in terms of @xmath165 .",
    "interpretation of the result is complicated for a survey with non - uniform noise .",
    "the percentage polarization is derived by inverting the polarized source counts to the total - intensity source counts .",
    "this requires an assumption of the shape of the @xmath82 distribution .",
    "our procedure for stacking polarized intensity includes variation of the noise , and constrains the distribution of @xmath82 to the extent possible .",

    "specific applications of stacking to wide - band polarization surveys are discussed briefly in section  [ wideband - sec ] .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations in @xcite included varying noise across the mosaic and the slope of the radio source counts in order to correct for these effects .",
    "the cause of the discrepancy between the present result and the higher median from @xcite is therefore not immediately clear .",
    "the median fractional polarization @xmath166 derived by these authors , compared with the @xmath167 polarization of _ detected _ sources with flux density near 10 mjy , indicates that the detected sources are well in the tail of the @xmath82 distribution , at 2 to 4 times the median .",
    "the median fractional polarization in this case may depend on the adopted slope of the source counts because both can affect the number of faint sources with polarized flux density higher than the median .",
    "experiments at the time did not suggest a strong dependance of the result on the adopted shape of the source counts or the detection threshold .",
    "a more likely potential cause for a higher median resulting from the analysis of @xcite is a more implicit effect related to the eddington bias mentioned above .",
    "although the monte carlo simulations in @xcite were designed to account for such bias , the likelihood function in their equation 6 contains only the error in @xmath40 associated with the noise in the image at the position of the source .",
    "while the simulated distributions in @xmath28 and @xmath40 did include the effect of noise , the detection threshold and implicitly the eddington bias through the use of the source counts curve in the simulations , sources with high @xmath40 but low @xmath168 due to their position in the mosaic may have received disproportionate weight in the likelihood function , because the error bars derived from the noise in the images would not accurately reflect the width of the probability distribution of @xmath40 for those sources .",
    "this may have lead the maximum likelihood fit to a higher median . a re - analysis of the more sensitive elais n1 data from @xcite is required to verify this suggestion .    with stacking we measured the median fractional polarization over nearly 3 orders of magnitude in flux density",
    "the results are mostly consistent with previous studies of the nvss above 80 mjy , and the trend for higher fractional polarization we find down to @xmath169 appears to be an extension of the trend seen for brighter sources by @xcite and @xcite . the increase in fractional polarization is so gradual that it becomes comparable to the statistical errors for a modest sample size of order 100 per flux density bin , that may be obtained from a deep integration of a small area of the sky . while we find consistency with deep - field results in their high signal to noise ratio limit",
    ", the median fractional polarization derived here is on the low side of the range of published values for sources fainter than 100 mjy .",
    "this illustrates how stacking can supplement observations of small areas with high sensitivity .",
    "establishing the trend in polarization with flux density of agn provides an extra constraint that allows us to include magnetic field properties in models of the cosmic evolution of radio sources through radio source counts .",
    "the cause of the gradual change in @xmath148 with flux density is not known .",
    "we speculate that this gradual change is related to a gradual shift in the radio source population , for example between steep and flat spectrum sources . stacking as a function of spectral index",
    "will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "a key parameter for the scientific impact of all - sky polarization surveys is the density on the sky of lines of sight with a measured rotation measure ( the rm grid ) .",
    "the polarized source counts presented here are on the low side of the range considered by @xcite , but they agree well with a recent determination by @xcite .",
    "@xcite sound a slope @xmath170 for the differential polarized source counts by fitting a power law count to polarized intensity distribution of sources not formally detected , comparable to the @xmath171 slope they found for detected sources in the range @xmath172 .",

    "the polarization sky survey of the universe s magnetism ( possum , * ? ? ? * ) is designed with a target sensitivity of @xmath179 .",
    "rotation measures can be extracted for sources with signal to noise ratio in polarization @xmath180 or @xmath181 .",
    "the results in table  [ sourcecounts - tab ] suggest possum will detect approximately 26 polarized sources per square degree extragalactic sky , and fewer close to the galactic plane where confusion with the diffuse galactic foreground will likely reduce completeness .",
    "if each detected polarized source above the threshold yields a useful rm measurement , the mean angular distance between rms will be about @xmath182 .",
    "the rm catalogue from @xcite contains approximately one source per square degree .",
    "@xcite assumed in their analysis that only 50% of polarized sources provide useful rms .",
    "when comparing the present results with their extrapolated source counts this factor 2 must be taken into account .",
    "the present polarized source counts at @xmath135 are then a factor 2 lower than those of @xcite , even though we find a gradual increase in fractional polarization for fainter sources .",
    "the difference is in the adopted total - intensity source counts .",

    "the polarized source counts presented here are agn - only counts .",
    "spiral galaxies may contribute to polarized source counts at 1.4 ghz , although depolarization is strong at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "polarized source counts models by @xcite show a significant contribution by spiral galaxies to the total polarized source counts below @xmath183 , but these models did not yet take into account an anti - correlation between fractional polarization and luminosity reported by @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the lower fractional polarization we find in this paper lead to a downward revision of the expected density of the rm grid from sky surveys with @xmath38jy sensitivity by a factor of a few .",
    "a recent paper on polarization in the goods - n field by @xcite comes to a similar conclusion .",
    "there is some latitude in the assumption that only 50% of sources may yield useful rms . for faint sources , statistical errors will dominate over complexity of the sources",
    "what constitutes a useful rm may differ between applications .",
    "future surveys of polarized radio emission will yield spectral image cubes of the stokes parameters that provide the sensitivity of broad bandwidth but avoid bandpass depolarization .",
    "rotation measure synthesis @xcite is the preferred method to derive polarization properties of radio sources from these spectropolarimetric surveys .",
    "the detection threshold for faraday synthesis for a predetermined acceptable false detection rate is higher because of the unknown rotation measure of a source @xcite .",
    "the detection threshold depends on the faraday depth range that is searched .",
    "the @xmath184 improvement of the noise level we found in the nvss up to sample size @xmath185 in principle provides sufficient sensitivity to detect polarization for samples selected at other wavelengths that remain below the detection threshold in total flux density .",
    "the number of targets is typically much larger than the number of frequency channels , which will be of order @xmath186 for surveys with bandwidth of @xmath31 ghz and frequency channels of @xmath31 mhz .",
    "the expected sensitivity for stacking a sample of @xmath187 in a single frequency channel of a wide - band polarization survey is therefore an order of magnitude larger than the expected sensitivity for a single source employing the full bandwidth .",
    "the advantage of high sensitivity in a narrow frequency range is that it allows investigation of the fractional polarization as a function of redshift in the rest frame of the target sample , using the bandwidth of the survey to trace the same emitting wavelength over a signifcant range in cosmological redshift .",
    "this becomes significant for surveys with the ska , that will provide large samples of sources at a wide range of redshifts . stacking polarized intensity",
    "can thus supplement faraday synthesis in investigations of the polarization of radio sources over cosmic time , as it capitalizes on a unique slice in multi - dimensional data space . the stacking experiment",
    "itself can address some aspects of faraday rotation in the source if one stacks the sample not just in individual channels , but also in channel averages of polarized intensity , taking both the vector sum and the scalar sum of polarized intensity over @xmath188 adjacent channels across the band .",
    "stacking ( averaging ) polarized intensity per channel in principle can detect polarization of fainter sources than rotation measure synthesis with a high significance level . a difference with the stacking discussed in this paper",
    "is that one can use the mean polarized intensity in place of the median intensity , because extreme data values are not expected .",
    "the central limit theorem applies and provides an analytic expression for the distribution of the outcome of the stack , provided that polarized intensity , or more precisely the signal to noise ratio in polarized intensity , is trusted to be constant across the frequency band . if the median is used , the bias correction in equation  [ p0_est - eq ] can be applied to this problem .",
    "if the polarized intensity is not constant , the non - linear relation between @xmath29 and @xmath40 introduces similar challenges as described in this paper for stacking polarized intensity from different sources .",
    "polarized intensity is likely to change between channels in surveys with a large bandwidth because its frequency dependence is the same as total intensity if the fractional polarization is constant , and because the system temperature may not be constant over the observed frequency range .",
    "if the polarized emission in a source is the composite of two or more regions subject to different amounts of faraday rotation , the vector sum of different rm components can also lead to complicated variation of polarized intensity with frequency .",
    "spectral index effects can be removed by dividing polarized intensity by total intensity .",
    "the statistics of the ratio is not strictly ricean because @xmath189 and @xmath190 will not have gaussian statistics , even if the noise in @xmath28 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is gaussian .",
    "if the signal to noise ratio in @xmath28 in a single frequency channel is high , ricean statistics may apply , and a correction can be made for polarization bias similar to that described in section  [ bias - sec ] with monte - carlo simulations , or based on the central limit theorem . if significant variation in @xmath191 exists , it will be difficult to extract even a mean or median value because the distribution of intrinsic values must be taken into account . splitting up the frequency band into a small number of sub - bands and stacking each sub - band individually",
    "can reduce this problem , or make it apparent that a more detailed analysis is required .",
    "if the noise is not uniform across the frequency band , one also needs to model the range of signal to noise ratios in the data . failing to do so may lead to systematic errors as a function of signal to noise ratio .",
    "stacking polarized intensity allows us to investigate the faint polarized signal of radio sources , using large samples covered by wide - area radio surveys .",
    "this technique is already useful at higher flux densities where a significant fraction of sources is detectable in polarization . as the sample covers a large area of the sky ,",
    "results from stacking are not sensitive to cosmic variance .",
    "it opens the possibility to investigate the polarization of sources with a low density on the sky , for which narrow deep fields do not provide a large enough sample .",
    "we present a procedure for stacking polarized intensity that uses the shape of the distribution of data values going into the stack as an additional constraint to solve for the unknown intrinsic distribution of polarized intensity of the sample .",
    "we find that the median fractional polarization of sources detected by the nvss from stacking polarized intensity is higher for fainter sources , but the degree of polarization of sources in the flux density range 2 to 20 mjy remains below 2.5% , which is significantly smaller than claimed by previous work .",
    "polarized radio source counts for radio sources powered by an active galactic nucleus are derived from stacking by convolving the @xmath82 distribution with total - intensity counts modeled by @xcite .",
