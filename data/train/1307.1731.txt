    "unification by orientation is the simplest picture historically invoked to explain the difference between different classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in particular , between luminous radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scheme , radio galaxies ( rgs ) of the frii type @xcite and radio - loud quasars ( rlqsos )",
    "are drawn from the same parent population , and each is only seen from a particular range of viewing angles with respect to the radio jet axis . from along this axis ( `` pole - on '' , viewing angle @xmath0 ) to some limiting angle @xmath1 , one can see directly to the active nucleus and the optical properties will be consistent with radio - loud quasars . beyond @xmath1 , to a completely `` edge - on '' ( @xmath2 ) perspective , one will see optical properties of a radio galaxy .",
    "the limiting angle is assumed to be determined by the opening angle of an obscuring structure , such as a dusty torus , that blocks our view into the nuclear regions of rgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "barthel ( 1989 ) published the first study constraining @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) and seemingly confirming the simplest prediction of orientation unification ; that the projected sizes of rlqsos in radio images should be smaller than those of rgs , due purely to geometric effects .",
    "although the idea that orientation could explain all properties of agn remained somewhat controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , unification through orientation has become quite popular for other types of objects beyond rgs and rlqsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of this controversy remains rich enough to have recently expanded to other tests over a wider parameter space , such as environmental measures over broad redshift ranges .",
    "if orientation sufficiently explains agn type , then the environments of different agn should be identical throughout cosmic history .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that rgs and rlqsos occupy similar environments , although obscured agn , which are often discussed within the `` dusty torus '' orientation framework , may have significantly different environments @xcite .",
    "barthel s ( 1989 ) original test remains fertile ground , and newer , larger samples covering both a wider range in redshift and radio luminosity are now being used to revisit the simple projected size tests conducted over 20 years ago . both singal et al .  (",
    "2013 ) and boroson et al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep ) find results that contradict those of barthel ( 1989 ) , with independent samples that show no difference in projected radio - source size distributions ( see  2 for more discussion of these results ) .",
    "therefore , they argue , factors other than orientation are necessary to differentiate between rgs and rlqsos .",
    "there is another possibility that can reconcile the seemingly contradictory size distribution results and keep the orientation by unification picture intact . in the simplest case ,",
    "all objects have a single intrinsic size .",
    "thus , if a viewing angle difference is present it will be manifested as a projected size difference in 100% of experiments .",
    "but , this single - size picture is highly idealized ",
    "so , assuming , instead , that samples of rgs and rlqsos are drawn randomly from some underlying _ distribution _ of intrinsic sizes ( which is the same for both types of object ) , is it possible to produce both sets of results ? while the effect of viewing angle on the projected sizes of objects is the main focus of all previous work on this subject , _ what is the effect of the underlying intrinsic size distribution _ ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore these effects via monte - carlo modeling of randomly oriented objects generated from a reasonable intrinsic size distribution , using the properties of the samples in the three works mentioned above as constraints .",
    "our main goal is to explore statistically , given an intrinsic size distribution and assuming that unification by orientation is correct , how likely one is to conclude that orientation drives apparent radio - source sizes .",
    "we also explore the effects of varying parameters such as the underlying intrinsic size distribution , the size of the sample , the relative number of rgs to rlqsos in the sample , and the role of different values of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we attempt to determine the ideal sample that is needed to reliably test the paradigm of unification through orientation for rgs and rlqsos .",
    "we use a cosmology where @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for all calculated parameters ( komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) , but we note the use of even more recent cosmologies will make no difference in our results",
    ". the notation @xmath8rg@xmath9 and @xmath8rlq@xmath9 will be used throughout to indicate the median projected sizes of rgs and rlqsos , respectively , in a sample or simulation .",
    "we utilize three real samples that have been used for this kind of projected size test ; those of barthel ( 1989 ; b89 ) , singal et al .",
    "( 2013 ; s13 ) , and boroson et al .  ( 2013 , in prep ; b13 ; see also boroson 2011 ) .",
    "we briefly summarize these below , but refer the reader to the original references for full details .",
    "some properties of the samples are summarized in table  [ samples ] .",
    "see also the appendix for an analysis of the significance of the results in these works when median statistics are taken into account .",
    "we acknowledge that there are other complications that could arise in projected size tests , beyond the effects of viewing angle and the distribution of intrinsic sizes",
    ". there may be issues with how source sizes are measured , bending and rotation of radio jets , and sample selection biases .",
    "additionally , it is well known that there are two subclasses of radio galaxy the high - excitation and low - excitation radio - galaxies ( hergs / lergs , respectively ; hine & longair 1979 , laing et al .  1983 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that lergs participate in orientation unification schemes , as they probably do nt harbor an agn .",
    "singal et al .  (",
    "2013 ) discuss this point explicitly .",
    "however , none of the samples discussed here use hergs explicitly . as our goal here is to test whether a distribution of intrinsic sizes can reconcile already published results , we will not make any additional cuts , nor any re - measurements of sizes of the original sources .",
    "this sample is drawn from the 3crr catalog @xcite , which is complete to @xmath1010.9 jy at 178 mhz .",
    "the high flux limit automatically restricts the sample to luminous radio sources at these redshifts ( though not strictly frii sources ) .",
    "it includes all of the quasars ( 17 ) and radio galaxies ( 33 ) in the catalog with redshifts between @xmath11 .",
    "however , we note that there are two rgs in the sample with updated redshifts that place them outside of this range : 3c318 moves from @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xcite , and 3c325 moves from @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we include these here with the updated redshifts in order to keep the relative numbers the same as the original test , but excluding them ( or including them with their original @xmath16 values ) does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the results from b89 are consistent with an orientation - based scheme .",
    "the projected size distribution of rgs is shifted toward larger values when compared to the qsos , with the median rg size 2.2 times larger than the median rlqso size ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the @xmath1045  viewing angle separating the two classes derived from the relative number of objects in each class .",
    "this sample is selected by matching radio data from 3 radio surveys with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the radio surveys utilized are the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) , faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ; becker et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "the low frequency observations of wenss are used to select a sample unbiased in orientation , as these frequencies are not sensitive to beamed radio core emission . a match between the optical position and a radio core",
    "was not required , and a substantial fraction shows lobes but no core .",
    "an explicit cut in radio luminosity ( @xmath18(325 mhz ) @xmath19 w hz@xmath5 ) excludes low - luminosity radio sources .",
    "this threshold is well above the flux limit of wenss within the redshift range ( @xmath20 ) of the sample . only objects targeted with sdss spectra as part of complete samples are included , and comparisons with other radio samples indicate that the only objects that are missing are a small number of optically faint radio galaxies .",
    "essentially all of the objects have steep radio spectra and fr ii radio morphology .",
    "the sample includes 51 rgs and 35 rlqsos , which can be distinguished by the sdss spectroscopy .",
    "the angular sizes were measured from the first images , which have sufficient resolution to easily resolve them at these redshifts .",
    "the findings using this sample contradict the original test by b89 .",
    "rlqsos are found to be larger than rgs by a median factor of 1.6 ( @xmath21 ) , which is used to argue that rlqsos can not be the same objects as rgs seen from smaller viewing angles .",
    "this sample is drawn from the molonglo reference catalog ( mrc ; kapahi et al .",
    "the catalog is also flux limited at low - frequency , but deeper than 3crr ( complete to @xmath100.95 jy at 408 mhz ) .",
    "however , the depth is shallow enough that only luminous radio sources of the type considered for unification are included . the redshift range is larger than that of the b89 sample , with @xmath22 .",
    "the full sample includes 379 rgs and 87 rlqsos , though various subsamples are also studied ( different redshift ranges , radio luminosities , excluding compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , etc . ) .",
    "we will only consider the full sample here as results are consistent amongst the various subsets considered by s13 .",
    "the s13 results contradict b89 as well , as no difference is seen in the projected size distributions , even when limited to the same redshift range .",
    "again , any difference suggested by the data indicates that the rlqsos are _ larger _ by a median factor of 1.3 ( @xmath23 ) , roughly in agreement with b13 .",

    "in order to build a distribution of intrinsic sizes to draw from , we start with the data from b89 , s13 and b13 . we use the apparent angular sizes and redshifts of each object , and assign each a random viewing angle consistent with a purely geometrically defined distribution",
    "( i.e. an edge - on orientation is much more likely than a pole - on one ; @xmath28 ) .",
    "an intrinsic size is calculated for each object , and the process is repeated @xmath29 times . the resulting distribution of sizes is shown for each sample in the first three panels of figure  [ intrinsicmodels ] , in 50 kpc bins .",
    "this method essentially provides the `` widest '' possible distribution of sizes , as the large number of iterations allows each object to be assigned a wide range of orientations . imposing a viewing angle restriction on the rg and rlqso subsamples ( i.e.  only allowing rgs to be seen from 90 to @xmath1 degrees and rlqsos from @xmath1 to 0 degrees ) does not change the resulting shape substantially .",
    "it simply changes which objects populate which part of the distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the apparent angular size distributions of the two subsets are similar .    we next fit functions to these generated distributions .",
    "the forms of the fits are determined purely empirically , and we assign them no physical significance .",
    "we find that two functions are needed in different regions to adequately fit the distributions . in natural logarithmic space , below 500 kpc a power law is used , and above 500 kpc a linear fit is used",
    ". the actual size at which the break between functions occurs is determined by where the fits are closest in @xmath30 ( not necessarily at 500 kpc ) .",
    "a cut at a maximum size of 3 mpc is also imposed , as sources larger than this are extremely rare ; however , we find that where this cut is placed has very little effect on our results . the final exponentials are then normalized by the largest value of @xmath30 .",
    "the fit parameters to this `` wide '' model are given in the middle portion of table  [ isizemodels ] , and the fits are shown as dashed lines in figure  [ intrinsicmodels ] .    as mentioned above , these fits give an upper limit to the size distributions , and may give an unrealistic number of large sources .",
    "if we take 40 kpc as a split between large and small sources , then indeed these fits result in distributions where 8090% of the sources are considered large .",
    "a more conservative large / small ratio for luminous radio sources is 4050% ( bridle & perley 1984 ) .",
    "therefore , we also determine , purely empirically and using the same functional forms , fit parameters for each sample that provide , on average , this ratio when the real sample numbers are randomly drawn from the distributions .",
    "these `` narrow '' fit parameters are given in the top portion of table  [ isizemodels ] , and shown as dotted lines in figure  [ intrinsicmodels ] .",
    "finally , the fit parameters for the three samples are averaged together ( separately for the wide and narrow distributions ) .",
    "these mean fits are used in the simulations to define the underlying intrinsic size distribution , and are shown in bold in table  [ isizemodels ] .      in order to completely separate the process of developing an intrinsic size distribution from the samples we are trying to simulate ,",
    "we develop a third distribution from an independent sample .",
    "mullin et al .",
    "( 2008 ; m08 ) present the properties of a sample of strictly frii type sources ( including rgs and qsos ) .",
    "as these are the types of objects for which this kind of projected size difference test is intended , it is an ideal sample to utilize in building an intrinsic size distribution .",
    "while the other samples above will contain many powerful frii type sources , they may not be restricted to _ only _ these objects .",
    "we apply the same method as in the last subsection to turn the apparent linear sizes presented in m08 into intrinsic sizes , by assigning each object a random viewing angle and repeating the process @xmath29 times to build a distribution .",
    "the result is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ intrinsicmodels ] .",
    "no longer does the distribution have the same functional form as the previous three samples , as there are quite a few more intermediate ( 100500 kpc ) sized sources , as well as quite a few more large ( @xmath31 kpc ) sources .",
    "this is reflective of the restriction to only frii objects , which are expected to be large .",
    "we find that two truncated gaussians accurately describe this distribution , one below @xmath10800 kpc , and another above .",

    "we note that , to estimate the value of @xmath1 in the orientation scenario , as b89 did , one must carefully select every rg and rlqso available in a sample without bias  but to look at projected size distributions this is less critical , so long as selection biases do not affect the rg and rlqso distributions differently .",
    "we are interested in the latter question here .",
    "so while it may not necessarily be possible ( or reasonable ) to force a sample to have an equal number of objects , we are merely interested in seeing how this ratio can affect the outcome .",
    "all of our results are presented using the linear projected sizes , and not the apparent angular sizes . in most cases ,",
    "the results using these values are quite similar , except using the s13 sample where differences in the apparent sizes are more pronounced when using the angular sizes .",
    "this is due to the redshift matching of the rgs and rlqsos .",
    "while statistically the s13 sample has well - matched distributions of redshifts for both rgs and rlqsos , there is a notable overabundance of low-@xmath16 rgs , which they discuss in their paper .",
    "if we neglect some of these objects , and force the @xmath16 distributions to match better by eye , this difference between using projected and angular sizes is diminished .",
    "most of our results are drawn from the distributions of @xmath49 , which are shown in figure  [ meddists ] with the peaks normalized to one in order to help illustrate the subtle change in shape when varying the intrinsic size distribution .",
    "these distributions are built by taking the ratio of the median rg projected size to the median rlqso projected size in each of the @xmath42 iterations .",

    "the expected ratio of median sizes is then @xmath53 .",
    "this predicts median projected size ratios of 2.5 , 1.8 , and 1.5 , for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "these `` expected '' sizes are shown in figure  [ medresults ] for reference . allowing a wider and wider distribution of possible intrinsic sizes will inflate these ratios , which our simulation predicts .",
    "figure  [ medresults ] shows that the median projected size ratios start high and tend toward the predicted value in moving from the gaussian to the wide to the narrow intrinsic size distribution .",
    "indeed , if we input a single intrinsic size for all objects , the expected median projected size ratios are always recovered . in the case where there is no viewing angle dependence ( no @xmath1 ) , we find a median projected size ratio of 1 , as expected  on average , rgs and rlqsos appear the same size because they have the same average viewing angle .",
    "we note that sample size has virtually no effect on these median values , and that while there is a dependence on the shape of the intrinsic size distribution , the effects are quite small .",

    "the effects of @xmath1 and the sample size are much more prominent .",
    "increasing @xmath1 tends to narrow the projected size ratio distributions . for a given value of @xmath1",
    ", a larger sample size will increasingly narrow the distributions ( recall that the sample size increases from b89 to b13 to s13 ) .",
    "this has important implications for the use of the median projected size ratio to infer things like a specific value of @xmath1 , which we will explore further in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "table  [ simresults ] gives the results of simulations for each sample , underlying intrinsic size distribution , and value of @xmath1 ; figures  [ prob1.5results]-[ksresults ] show them graphically .",
    "table  [ simresults ] is divided into four main sections .",
    "each of those four sections is divided into two  the top half shows results keeping the original @xmath45 and @xmath50 values , while the bottom gives results with the original @xmath45 but resampling to a 1:1 @xmath50 ratio .",
    "the top three main sections give the probability of various outcomes based on integrating the pdfs .",
    "we discuss each of the four sections in the table in the following subsections .",
    "the first section of table  [ simresults ] shows the probability of finding a value of @xmath49 of 1.5 or greater , and the results are shown graphically in figure  [ prob1.5results ] .",
    "the value 1.5 was chosen as a limit because it is the smallest ratio we would expect to find ( see figure  [ medresults ] ) , unless the value of @xmath1 is significantly larger than 60 .    in the case of no orientation unification ( no @xmath1 ) and a single intrinsic size ,",
    "the probability of seeing a projected size difference is essentially zero .",
    "however , one striking result is that when considering the intrinsic size distribution as well as the orientation , depending on the sample size , there is a significant probability that rgs will appear larger than rlqsos , even if there is no difference in viewing angle to rgs and rlqsos .",

    "essentially , these are the values we would need to obtain , at a minimum , to argue that the assumptions we put into the model are recovered , i.e.  for example , that we could use the median projected size ratio to find the input @xmath1 .",

    "this seems to indicate that sample selection effects are not a primary reason that the results of b89 and s13/b13 are contradictory , and that the problem really is with the underlying orientation model .",
    "discussions in b89 , s13 , and b13 focus on viewing angle , while somewhat ignoring that there is an underlying intrinsic size distribution that might influence projected sizes . if the median size ratio is used as a proxy for how different the projected sizes are , it is interesting to ask whether the underlying intrinsic size distribution can dilute the role of viewing angle for a given sample size .",

    "once a distribution is present , the different possible values of @xmath1 affect the results more than the shape of the distribution of intrinsic sizes .",
    "while the shape of the intrinsic size distribution is relatively unimportant to the median projected size tests , the presence of a distribution instead of a single size has important consequences in the interpretation of these kinds of projected size results .",
    "first , it makes it possible to identify a significantly large projected size ratio , even when a viewing angle dependence is not present . in the small sample of b89 , where a difference was indeed found ,",
    "our simulations show that there is a 10 - 20% chance of obtaining this result even if no viewing angle difference between rgs and rlqsos exists .",
    "our results also show that the ratio @xmath49 does not simply scale to a value of @xmath1 , as the intrinsic size distribution makes this ratio vary quite a bit compared to the single intrinsic size case . for example , a median projected size ratio of @xmath102 is not that unlikely to find for almost any sample size and any value of @xmath1 . so using this value to obtain ( or confirm ) @xmath57 ,",
    "as b89 did , is unconvincing .",
    "a complication in these simulations and in performing this kind of test in reality can arise due to the effects of the so - called `` receding torus '' @xcite , if such an effect really exists .",
    "this model suggests that as the quasar accretion disk increases in luminosity , it will sublimate away more of the dust in the torus and cause the amount of re - processed ir radiation to decrease as the covering fraction of the dusty material decreases .",
    "this inverse relationship has been observed in many studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but its explanation assumes that the dust is in a torus - like structure and thus assumes that unification by orientation is ( at least partially ) true . if the `` receding torus '' interpretation is correct , then assuming a single @xmath1 for all sources is not strictly correct , as each object has its own value of @xmath1 that determines whether it is seen as a rg or rlqso .",
    "we could in principle estimate this value for each object in each iteration of our simulations by using an optical luminosity as a proxy for the covering fraction and hence @xmath1 , which would further restrict the possible @xmath66 randomly assigned . as a simple test of how this could affect our results , we re - ran the simulations allowing each object in each iteration to be assigned a value of @xmath66 restricted by a randomly generated value of @xmath1 , uniformly distributed between 20  and 60  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the results are consistent with what is expected for the average @xmath1 , in this case 40 , and any conclusions would remain the same .",
    "this however assumes that both the rgs and rlqsos have the same range of @xmath1 values , or equivalently ( in the `` receding torus '' model ) accretion disk luminosities .",
    "therefore we also simulate situations where some selection effect in each sample causes the rlqsos to have more luminous accretion disks than the rgs .",
    "we do this by assigning each rg a random @xmath1 between 20  and 40 , and each rlqso a random @xmath1 from 40  to 60 .",
    "in this situation , one is less likely to observe a projected size difference ; in terms of the ks test , even with the large sample of s13 a difference is observed in only @xmath1075% of experiments , which would weaken our conclusions regarding the orientation model .",
    "thus , we stress that if the `` receding torus '' interpretation is valid , samples built for this projected size test must also be somewhat well - matched in accretion disk luminosity , which may be difficult to constrain for rgs in particular , as by definition we can not see through to the nuclear emission .",
    "our modeling also provides the ideal sample size with which to detect a difference in projected size distributions , if one exists due to orientation effects .",
    "this number can be dauntingly large if @xmath1 is large ( @xmath67 ) and especially for samples with few rlqsos compared to rgs .",
    "the situation is worse for the narrower intrinsic size distribution .",
    "it seems that sample sizes thus far have been too small to identify rgs as much larger than rlqsos at a high probability .",
    "however , if the assumptions we have made here are valid ( and we argue that they are at least reasonable ) , it seems quite clear that the conflicting results between b89 and s13/b13 _ can not easily be reconciled with a paradigm in which different projected sizes of radio sources result solely from orientation .",
    "_ b89 , b13 , and s13 should have seen a median projected size ratio of over 1.5 in @xmath1075 , 80 , and 90% of experiments , respectively .",
    "only b89 observed such a ratio , and as mentioned above , there is a small but significant probability that b89 could find this ratio by chance even if there is no unification by orientation .",
    "if , instead of a ratio of 1.5 , we are looking for a size ratio consistent with a particular value of @xmath1 , the probability that b89 , b13 , or s13 would have observed such a ratio is lower . because the projected size ratio distributions roughly accumulate around the `` expected '' ratios , huge numbers of sources are needed to recover these values at high probability . this could make it easier to reconcile conflicting results .    in terms of the ks tests , the b13 sample contains a number of objects for which there is a 50/50 chance of seeing a projected size difference ( or closer to 75% if the gaussian distribution is correct ) .",
    "but it seems that b89 would have to have been somewhat fortunate to see this difference given their sample size  it would be apparent in @xmath1025 - 40% of experiments , while s13 would simultaneously have to have been very unlucky to miss it",
    " a size difference should be apparent in @xmath6490% of samples that comprise the number of objects studied in s13 .",
    "the advantage of using the median projected size ratio comparison over a ks test is that it is much less sensitive to the shape of the real intrinsic size distribution ( which is not well constrained ) than the ks test .",
    "the ks test however has an advantage in that it requires a smaller overall sample to identify a projected size difference in a large fraction of experiments .",
    "it is possible that b13 or s13 could have failed to measure projected size differences due to random sampling  but finding that rlqsos appear larger than rgs in the popular paradigm , while also still possible , is very unlikely . for the s13 sample this result should only occur in @xmath68% of experiments .",
    "so , it appears that the underlying intrinsic size distribution does not matter enough to question the newest results regarding this problem  the s13 and b13 tests have therefore convincingly demonstrated that the simplest schemes that unify rgs and rlqsos by orientation are insufficient .",
    "cast solely in terms of viewing angle , recent results in the literature strongly contradict unification by orientation for radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , as the prediction that rgs should have larger projected radio - source sizes due to a more edge - on perspective is not confirmed .",
    "however , it is highly unlikely that all sources have the same intrinsic size and that results can be interpreted solely in terms of viewing angle .",
    "we explored the role that the underlying intrinsic size distribution of radio sources plays in this type of analysis , paying particular attention to the question of whether the conflicting results can be reconciled by random sampling of this intrinsic size distribution .",
    "we summarize the results as follows :    * whether or not a difference in projected radio - source sizes will be seen in a given sample depends heavily on the critical viewing angle that separates rgs and rlqsos ( if one really exists ) .",
    "while we can not control this value in reality , understanding this dependence can be useful for analyzing the robustness of past and future results . *",
    "sample size is critical for discriminating differences in projected sizes for rgs and rlqsos  and must number at the very least in the several hundreds for a robust detection . * the chance of detecting a difference in projected size does depend on , but is not particularly sensitive to , the shape of the underlying intrinsic size distribution , at least for the distributions tested here .",
    "the existence of a distribution as opposed to a single intrinsic size is more important , in general , than the form it takes . *",
    "it appears that sample selection biases are unlikely to be the reason conflicting results have been found , as all three real samples tested here behave in an identical manner for all parameters . * in smaller samples ( @xmath10100 or less ) ,",
    "there is a significant probability that rgs will appear larger than rlqsos , _ even if there is no difference in viewing angle to the two subsets _ , due to random sampling of the intrinsic size distribution . *",
    "it is highly unlikely to find rlqsos appearing larger than rgs in the standard orientation model , even with a wide distribution of intrinsic sizes . *",
    "it is possible , _ but very unlikely _",
    ", under the simplest unification by orientation model , for conflicting results in the literature to be reconciled .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that there is , indeed , a major problem with using the projected size distribution of luminous radio sources to argue that radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars can be unified by orientation .",
    "our analyses suggest that if orientation does play a role in our view of radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , it can not be the dominant factor based solely on comparison of the apparent sizes of these sources on the sky .",
    "we would like to thank ritaban chatterjee for helping develop the idea for this project , as well as for useful discussions .",
    "mad , jcr , and adm were partially supported by nasa through adap award nnx12ae38 g and epscor award nnx11am18a and by the national science foundation through grant number 1211112 .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "b89 report that rgs appear larger than rlqsos , in contradiction with the results of b13/s13 . as both sets of results rely on measurements of the median of a distribution , and as scientists predominantly work with significances based on _ the mean _ , it is worth reviewing these results in the context of inferring significances from _ the median_. to do this , we follow the method outlined in @xcite .    to locate the 2@xmath41 limits in the smallest - to - largest ordered list of projected sizes , we first calculate @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is either @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "the variable @xmath71 ranges from 0 to 1 and has an expected value of 0.5 .",
    "@xmath72 represents the locations ( indices ) of the 2@xmath41 size limits in the ordered list of size measurements , normalized by @xmath70 .",
    "multiplying these normalized indices by @xmath70 and rounding up to the nearest integer allows us to approximate the location in the list of values of the 2@xmath41 upper and lower limits . reading off these values from the list provides the range of median size values for either rgs or rlqsos within the 2@xmath41 errors in each of the above samples .",
    "we see that in all cases there is significant overlap between the median sizes of the subsamples .",
    "thus , when the errors on the median apparent sizes are taken into account , it is clear that _ none of these samples are of sufficient size to determine reliably if rgs really appear larger than rlqsos _ , and claims based simply on the median sizes in the samples are highly suspect .",
