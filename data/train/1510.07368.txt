    "despite the tremendous progress made recently regarding the intrinsic properties of the neutrinos , much remains to be learned .",
    "for instance , it is not known whether the neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles .",
    "the pattern of masses and mixing parameters is also a mystery . within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "it is well - established that these parameters are functions of the energy scale , and are governed by the renormalization group equations ( rge ) .",
    "indeed , the evolution of the gauge couplings ( e.g. , asymptotic freedom and gauge coupling unification ) has been very successfully applied to particle physics , forming an essential part of the foundation of the standard model .",
    "one would expect similar considerations to apply to the higgs couplings ( i.e. , the mass matrices ) .",
    "in addition , these effects are indispensable toward a theoretical understanding of the mass matrices . unfortunately , to this date",
    "existing results are usually numerical in nature and not very general .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the complexity of the rge for these parameters . while the rge in terms of the mass matrices are reasonably simple , these matrices contain a large number of unphysical degrees of freedom , and the rge for physical variables are very complicated indeed .",
    "for instance , the mixing matrix is rephasing invariant , which is characteristic of the mixing of quantum states , for which the phase of an individual state vector is unobservable . to extract the physical parameters ,",
    "one may proceed by fixing some phases .",
    "this is similar to  fixing a gauge \" in gauge theories .",
    "thus , in the standard parametrization , one sets four phases in the mixing matrix ( those of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) to vanish , arriving at three angles and a phase . when applied to the analysis of the rge ,",
    "one is enforcing this  gauge \" at every energy scale .",
    "the lack of a theoretical rationale for this choice , we believe , contributes to the complexity of the rge , when expressed in terms of the standard parameters .    in this work",
    "we investigate the one - loop rge evolution of dirac neutrinos , using a rephasing invariant parametrization introduced earlier .",
    "what characterizes this parametrization is its symmetry structure under flavor permutations .",
    "indeed , we establish a set of rge which exhibits a simple structure with built - in permutation symmetry .",
    "this set of equations is not as formidable as the one written in terms of the standard parametrization .",
    "its solutions are studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "we found a rge invariant , in addition to obtaining some approximate solutions .",
    "numerical examples are also presented .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the rephasing invariant parametrization that will be used in this work . their properties are also discussed . in section iii , we obtain the rge in a compact and simple form . from these we derive both exact and approximate rge invariants in section iv . in section",
    "v , we further obtain approximate solutions of the rge and provide some numerical examples .",
    "we then summarize the work in section vi .",

    "the relations between this @xmath9 parametrization and the standard ones , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the dirac cp phase @xmath30 are shown in appendix a.    one may further obtain useful expressions of the rephasing invariant combination formed by products of four mixing elements @xcite , @xmath31 which can be reduced to @xmath32 where the second term in either expression is one of the @xmath33 s ( @xmath34 s ) defined in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "in addition , the combination of five elements can be written in the following form : @xmath35 here if @xmath36 , then @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "this means that if one takes the @xmath39th row and the @xmath40th column , complex conjugates the vertex ( @xmath41 ) , then the product is rephasing invariant and has a well - defined imaginary part .",
    "certain intriguing properties of @xmath42 are shown also in appendix a.",
    "the rge for the hermitian matrix @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , is given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite)@xmath45 at the one - loop level . here , @xmath39 is real and model - independent , @xmath46 , with model - dependent coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the charged lepton yukawa matrix .",
