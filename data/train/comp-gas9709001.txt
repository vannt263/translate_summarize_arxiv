    "problems of fluid flow are of great practical importance in such areas as mechanical engineering and meteorology .",
    "a full theoretical understanding of fluid flow is very difficult because of the complex dynamics . in particular , in the regime of fully developed turbulence",
    "we face a dynamical system with fluctuations on all length scales .",
    "the small scale structures influence the dynamics at larger scales in a way that is hard to control analytically .",
    "numerical simulations are therefore an essential tool in fluid dynamics . however , with present day computers a full simulation of realistic problems from first principles is beyond reach .",
    "already simple model problems exhaust the biggest machines available .",
    "hence , in practical applications one makes additional assumptions , especially about the small scale dynamics , which are difficult to justify theoretically , and which involve free parameters .",
    "in fact , the primary systematic error in numerical simulations of fluid flow is due to the finite grid size that is necessary to discretize the continuum navier - stokes equations .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to point out that perfect discretizations , i.e. ones that are completely free of grid artifacts , exist and can be constructed explicitly .",
    "the existence of perfect discretizations is a direct consequence of wilson s renormalization group theory @xcite .",
    "the idea of the renormalization group is to deal with the fluctuations at different length scales step by step in scale . in this way",
    "the influence of small scale fluctuations on the large scale dynamics can , at least in principle , be controlled exactly .",
    "the renormalization group approach has been useful in the study turbulence and has been applied to various problems previously ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some examples ) .",
    "recently , however , in the context of lattice quantum field theories so - called perfect actions have been constructed for various models using the renormalization group . originally , hasenfratz and niedermayer iterated a renormalization group transformation to obtain a perfect discretization for the 2-dimensional @xmath0 nonlinear @xmath1-model , and they demonstrated that grid artifacts were eliminated even on coarse lattices @xcite .",
    "the same method has been applied to lattice fermions @xcite , to 4-dimensional pure @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite and to full qcd @xcite .",
    "here we use similar methods in classical physics . in principle",
    ", the renormalization group can be used to derive perfect discretizations for any differential equation .",
    "examples of great practical importance are the laplace and poisson equations , maxwell s equations and the navier - stokes equation .",
    "a perfect discretization of the laplace equation was obtained by bell and wilson in an early study of scalar lattice field theory @xcite .",
    "the perfect action for a classical gauge field  and hence a perfect discretization of maxwell s equations  has been constructed in refs.@xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the navier - stokes equations . here",
    "we do not treat the problem in its full complexity yet . specifically , we restrict ourselves to incompressible fluids and we assume static , slow flows .",
    "the first step in our program is to define large scale lattice variables from the underlying continuum fields . in the case of the navier - stokes equations these are the velocity and pressure fields .",
    "we average the continuum pressure over a cube of side length @xmath3 to define the large scale pressure variables , which then naturally live on a lattice of spacing @xmath3 consisting of the cube centers .",
    "similarly , the velocity field is averaged over the interface between two neighboring cubes , and hence the corresponding lattice field lives on the links connecting neighboring lattice points .",
    "this construction ensures that the continuity equation maintains a simple form on the lattice . by construction",
    "we know exactly how the large scale variables are related to the continuum fields .",
    "the goal of the next step is to derive equations of motion for the large scale fields . solving these equations yields exact results for the averaged continuum quantities",
    "this is in contrast to standard discretization procedures , where the lattice field represents an approximation of the continuum field at the same point .",
    "the approximation becomes exact only in the continuum limit @xmath4 , because the value of the field at a specific point is influenced by the dynamics at arbitrarily small scales .",
    "a perfect discretization , on the other hand , ensures exact results for averaged continuum quantities already at finite @xmath3 .",
    "still , the values of the continuum fields can be reconstructed from the lattice data by using so - called perfect fields .",
    "the second step is to derive exact equations of motion for the lattice fields .",
    "one possibility to do that is to iterate a discrete renormalization group transformation .",
    "this is done by starting on a very fine lattice ( in fact , at the end the lattice spacing of the fine lattice is sent to zero ) , and then performing an infinite sequence of blocking steps , in which the lattice fields are averaged over blocks , and effective equations of motion for the block variables are derived . here",
    "we proceed differently by blocking directly from the continuum .",
    "the result is identical to the discrete , iterative procedure , but the derivation is more transparent .",
    "wilson was the first to discover this technique @xcite , which has not been very well known until recently . for example , blocking from the continuum was also used in the derivation of the qcd perfect action @xcite .",
    "in contrast to quantum field theory there is no action for the full navier - stokes problem .",
    "still , blocking from the continuum can be directly applied to the equations of motion .",
    "the constraint that identifies the large scale lattice variables with the averaged continuum fields is implemented through a lagrange multiplier .",
    "solving the equations for the continuum variables in terms of the lattice fields and plugging the result back into the constraint equations leads to the equations for the large scale variables .    for numerical applications",
    "it is essential that the lattice equations of motion are as local as possible . in this paper",
    "we distinguish three types of locality : ultralocal , local and nonlocal .",
    "a lattice equation is called ultralocal if it couples the lattice field at a given site to a finite number of neighboring sites only .",
    "consider , for example , the 1-dimensional laplace equation @xmath5 its standard lattice discretization @xmath6 = 0\\ ] ] is ultralocal because it couples the field at the point @xmath7 to its nearest neighbors at @xmath8 and @xmath9 only . in general , a perfect discretization will not lead to an ultralocal coupling .",
    "the couplings to fields at distant sites are non - zero , but exponentially suppressed . in that case",
    "we say that the lattice equation is local . by optimizing the parameters of the renormalization group transformation one can control the strength of the exponential decay .",
    "it turns out that the parameters can be chosen such that the perfect equations become ultralocal in one dimension . in practice",
    ", even in higher dimensions this leads to extremely local perfect lattice equations , whose exponentially suppressed couplings to distant neighbors can safely be neglected . in particular , as it will become clear later , even the ultralocal eq.([standard ] ) turns out to be perfect",
    ". this would not be the case for the common approach to discretization problems , where one interprets lattice derivatives as approximations of continuum derivatives at the same point .",
    "still , even then one can find a perfect discretization .",
    "it is a well known result in engineering that a smooth function @xmath10 can be reconstructed from its values @xmath11 on a lattice by @xmath12 here we have assumed that @xmath10 is infinitely differentiable and that its fourier transform exists .",
    "the above equation yields @xmath13.\\ ] ] this exactly represents the continuum second derivative of the function at the lattice point @xmath14 .",
    "now the lattice derivative comprises terms at arbitrarily large distances , and their contributions are suppressed only power - like .",
    "this is what we call a nonlocal coupling . in this case",
    "the contributions from large distances can not be neglected and therefore this equation is not of practical use . in contrast , the advantage of using block averaged fields is that their perfect discretizations are local .",
    "as opposed to previous applications of perfect discretizations , which dealt with infinite volumes or finite systems with periodic boundary conditions , the incorporation of more general boundary conditions is essential in fluid dynamics . while it is straightforward to implement periodic boundary conditions , it is more difficult to treat fixed boundary conditions , which occur in typical fluid dynamics applications .",
    "still , it turns out that fixed boundary conditions can be represented exactly in the perfect lattice equations .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to channels whose cross section is a rectangular polygon .",
    "arbitrarily curved boundaries can in principle be handled using curvelinear coordinates , but we do not elaborate on this issue here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the large scale lattice pressure and velocity variables by blocking from the continuum , and we investigate their behavior under discrete renormalization group transformations .",
    "section 3 contains the derivation of perfect equations of motion for hagen - poiseuille flow .",
    "the parameter in the renormalization group transformation is optimized for ultralocality in two dimensions .",
    "we verify explicitly that also in three dimensions continuum physics is exactly reproduced . in section 4",
    "we show analytically that the equations of motion indeed satisfy a factor 2 renormalization group step .",
    "section 5 presents results of a numerical calculation of the lattice fields . in section 6",
    "we construct the perfect velocity field that allows reconstruction of the continuum field from the lattice data .",
    "section 7 deals with static , slow flows in general .",
    "we derive the perfect lattice version of the corresponding navier - stokes equations .",
    "in section 8 we present a perturbative method of introducing the non - linear term to equation of motion .",
    "finally , section 9 contains concluding remarks on how to extend our construction to the full navier - stokes equations and to arbitrarily shaped boundaries .",
    "we also speculate about applications of perfect discretizations to numerical simulations of turbulent flows .",
    "the continuum navier - stokes equations are formulated in terms of pressure and velocity variables . here",
    "we consider static flows in @xmath15 dimensions , and hence pressure @xmath16 and velocity @xmath17 with @xmath18 are functions of the position vector @xmath19 only",
    ". for incompressible fluids the velocity field obeys the continuity equation @xmath20 to define the large scale lattice pressure variables @xmath21 the continuum pressure field @xmath16 is averaged over a @xmath15-dimensional cube @xmath22 of side length @xmath3 centered at @xmath7 , @xmath23 the variables @xmath21 naturally live on a lattice of spacing @xmath3 formed by the cube centers @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , for the velocity field we define @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26-dimensional face separating the cubes @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath29 is the unit vector in the @xmath30-direction .",
    "it is natural to associate the velocity variables with the links connecting neighboring lattice sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 . now",
    "the @xmath30-component of @xmath7 is a half - integer multiple of the lattice spacing .",
    "the lattice velocity variables can be interpreted as volume flow rates per cross sectional area of the faces separating neighboring cubes .",
    "this definition of the lattice velocity field is natural because the lattice continuity equation then assumes an ultralocal form .",
    "it is simply given by @xmath33= \\frac{1}{a^{d-1 } } \\sum_i \\big [ \\int_{f_{i , x+a\\hat i/2 } } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "\\partial_i v_i(y ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used gauss law together with the continuum continuity equation .",
    "the definition of lattice variables by blocking from the continuum can be viewed as a renormalization group transformation with an infinite blocking factor .",
    "in fact , the same result could be obtained by iterating block factor 2 transformations starting from an arbitrarily fine lattice . to identify the corresponding factor 2 transformation we now block from the continuum to a lattice of twice the lattice spacing @xmath34 .",
    "the continuum pressure variables are then integrated over cubes @xmath35 of side length @xmath36 which contain @xmath37 original cubes @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the resulting pressure variable @xmath38 on the coarse lattice is a block average of the pressure variables on the fine lattice .",
    "we use @xmath39 to denote that the cube @xmath22 belongs to the block @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding geometry is illustrated in figure [ blocking ] .    [ blocking ]    similarly , for the velocity field we have @xmath40 here @xmath39 denotes that the sum includes faces @xmath25 on the fine lattice that belong to the face @xmath41 on the coarse lattice .",
    "of course , by construction the coarse lattice velocity variables also obey the continuity equation .",
    "this block factor 2 renormalization group transformation ( rgt ) will be used later to demonstrate that the structure of the perfect equations of motion reproduces itself under renormalization .",
    "for simplicity we first discuss the derivation of perfect equations of motion in the context of hagen - poiseuille flow .",
    "the general equations for static , slow flows are derived in section 6 .",
    "we start from the navier - stokes equation @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , and @xmath44 is its density . we restrict ourselves to incompressible flows , i.e. to a constant density , and thus the continuity equation applies .",
    "the appropriate boundary condition for a viscous fluid at a fixed wall is @xmath45 for all @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , we consider static hagen - poiseuille flow , i.e. a constant pressure gradient @xmath46 , in a channel with square cross section @xmath47 along the @xmath15-direction .",
    "hence , the pressure is given by @xmath48 .",
    "the velocity is along the channel , i.e. only @xmath49 is nonzero and in addition independent of @xmath50 .",
    "then the equations reduce to the @xmath26-dimensional poisson equation @xmath51 with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath52 at the edge of the square .",
    "this equation follows from a variational principle of an action @xmath53 = \\int_a d^{d-1}y [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_i v_d(y ) \\partial_i v_d(y ) +   \\frac{\\delta p}{\\nu \\rho } v_d(y)].\\ ] ] note that here @xmath30 runs from 1 to @xmath26 only .",
    "the action is useful in our derivation of the perfect equations of motion .",
    "yet we want to stress that the existence of an action is not really necessary .",
    "this is crucial because there is no action principle for the full navier - stokes problem .",
    "in fact , writing the above action was possible only because we have removed the time dependent dissipative element of the full problem and have forced the flow to be static .    what is the perfect discretization of the poisson equation ? to answer that question we consider the large scale lattice variable @xmath54 note that the face @xmath55 is nothing more than a @xmath26-dimensional cube , and @xmath56 behaves practically as a @xmath26-dimensional scalar",
    "we want to impose eq.([constraint ] ) as a constraint for each face @xmath55 . for this purpose",
    "we add it to the action using a lagrange multiplier field @xmath57 that lives on the face @xmath55 @xmath58&=&\\int_a d^{d-1}y   [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_i v_d(y ) \\partial_i v_d(y ) + \\frac{\\delta p}{\\nu \\rho } v_d(y ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_x a^{d-1 } [ \\eta_{d , x }   ( v_{d , x } - \\frac{1}{a^{d-1 } } \\int_{f_{d , x } } d^{d-1}y \\",

    "this would not really be necessary , but its coefficient @xmath59 will allow us to optimize the perfect equation s locality , and therefore it is of great practical importance .",
    "next we derive equations of motion from the variational principle of the action . varying the action with respect to @xmath49 yields @xmath60 where @xmath61 for @xmath62 and zero otherwise . varying",
    "the action with respect to @xmath57 one obtains @xmath63 it appears that the constraint of eq.([constraint ] ) is correctly implemented only for @xmath64 .",

    "the incorporation of boundary conditions is nontrivial , and has been done explicitly for hagen - poisseille flow . for practical applications it is essential that the perfectly discretized equations of motion are very local ( although in general not ultralocal ) .",
    "in particular , the lattice couplings to distant variables decay exponentially , and one can safely restrict oneself to a few nearby neighbors .",
    "in fact , we have performed numerical simulations using the perfectly discretized equations of motion for laminar flow in a channel with quadratic cross section and we have verified explicitly that an arbitrarily coarse lattice indeed gives continuum answers .",

    "an important aspect of our construction are the so - called perfect fields .",

    "hence , especially when we are working on a coarse lattice , we are not limited to lattice points .",
    "of course , a method like that would be most welcome in numerical simulations of more complicated fluid dynamics systems , especially in the case of turbulence . in these simulations the effects of a finite lattice spacing are the main source of systematic errors .",
    "we have made a first step in this direction by deriving the perfect equations of motion in the presence of the nonlinear term that gives rise to turbulence .",
    "however , we have included that term only to first order , while a perfect discretization of turbulent flows would require a treatment to all orders .",
    "this could be achieved numerically in analogy to @xcite by solving a minimization problem on a multigrid .",
    "when one wants to simulate turbulence one should not restrict oneself to static flows .",
    "then the definition of the averaged lattice variables should be generalized .",
    "in particular , one should also average pressure and velocity in time .",
    "in addition , one may want to simulate compressible fluids , which would bring in an averaged density variable .",
    "our techniques are still applicable to these cases , but the actual implementation is nontrivial .    in conclusion , we have proposed a renormalization group treatment of problems in fluid dynamics .",
    "the renormalization group implies that perfect discretizations of the continuum navier - stokes equations exist .",
    "the perfectly discretized equations of motion have been constructed explicitly for slow static flows , and have been optimized for locality .",
    "this is essential in practical applications .",
    "the renormalization group offers a systematic way of treating small scale effects in fluid dynamics . realizing this program for the full navier - stokes problem",
    "requires a lot of work .",
    "still , the first steps that we have taken , have led to promising results .",
