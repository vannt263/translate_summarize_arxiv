    "during the last decade , technological developments have made possible the fabrication of one and zero dimensional nanostructures such as quantum wires and quantum dots ( qds ) .",
    "the interest on these systems comes from their novel optical and transport properties and has been stimulated by the success of quantum wells in technology .",
    "the effect of reduced dimensionality on the electronic excitations and the related optical properties has been the subject of intensive investigation and nowadays it is more or less well understood .",
    "semiconductor - doped glasses ( sdgs ) are particularly useful to investigate the vibrational modes in quasi - zero - dimensional systems , because the use of appropriate thermal annealing techniques makes it possible to grow semiconductor nanocrystallites with small enough radius to show the effects of spatial confinement on the optical vibrational modes .",
    "raman spectroscopy is a valuable tool to probe the active optical modes and also to obtain information about the electronic system .",
    "in addition , resonant raman scattering ( rrs ) can be used as a size selective technique@xcite , which could play an important role on sdgs due to their broad dispersion in microcrystallite sizes .",
    "recently , the mechanism and features of raman scattering by semiconductor nanocrystallites have been studied@xcite , showing the effects of the reduced dimensionality on the raman shift and lineshape .",
    "a preliminary theory of first - order rrs in spherical microcrystallites has been developed in and on the basis of a continuum model for polar optical vibrations .",
    "these models consider the electronic intermediate states as uncorrelated electron - hole pair ( ehp ) states , that is , in the strong size quantized regime ( model i ) .",
    "an extension to the above theories , considering the electron - hole interaction effects has been recently presented@xcite ( model ii ) .",
    "the calculations performed in are strictly valid for excitons completely confined within dots .",
    "raman scattering in the frhlich configuration considerably depends on the differences between electron and hole wave functions ( _ electron - hole decompensation_)@xcite .",
    "the theoretical values of the raman cross section and lineshape should be modified by the electron - hole model and the confinement potential used in the entire calculation .",
    "hence , in the framework of a free ehp model with infinite barriers the same wave functions for electrons and holes are obtained and null contribution of the frhlich mechanism to the raman cross section is achieved .",
    "the scattering efficiencies following models i and ii considerably differ when absolute values are calculated , even for qds with radii smaller than the exciton bohr radius . in model",
    "i the finite confinement barriers are considered but regardless of excitonic effects .",
    "model ii includes the electron - hole correlation in an infinite barrier , but the chosen potential diminishes the electron - hole decompensation occurring through the finite band offsets potential . in on the lines of model ii an effective radius @xmath0 was introduced in order to take into account the penetration of the exciton wave function into the adjacent medium .",
    "this procedure allows , in some way , the rrs calculations in real systems using the mathematical simplicity of the infinite barrier basis functions . we will show that within the above approach accurate exciton ground state energies can be achieved",
    "this approach underestimates the calculated raman absolute values .",
    "it is well established that a reliable raman scattering theory becomes necessary in order to interpret rrs absolute values in semiconductors@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to clarify the electron - hole decompensation effect on the absolute values of scattering intensities and raman lineshapes taking into account uncorrelated and correlated electron - hole theories and using different confinement potential models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we provide the theoretical basis needed to obtain the raman cross section where the electronic intermediate states are excitons in a finite spherical potential box ( model iii ) .",
    "theories i and ii are derived as proper limits from the more general model iii .",
    "we also compare the raman intensity values for cds qds embedded in a glass matrix , obtained along the lines of the above described theoretical models . in sec .",
    "iii we present the conclusions of the present work .",
    "the raman cross section @xmath1 of a dot of radius @xmath2 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the incoming ( outgoing ) photon energy , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the energy ( broadening ) of the intermediate @xmath8 electronic state @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the quantum number of the total electronic angular momentum square ) , @xmath11 their optical strengths , @xmath12 is the matrix element of the electron - frhlich - type lattice interaction ( in dimensionless units@xcite ) and @xmath13 is the vibron@xcite quantum number with angular momentum @xmath14 and frequency @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is a constant which depends on the semiconductor parameters and the embedding medium@xcite .    the exciton wave function @xmath17 is obtained by the expansion @xmath18 where the basis functions @xmath19 are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum square @xmath20 , its z - projection @xmath21 , and the hamiltonian of the free ehp in the dot .",
    "the functions @xmath22 are constructed from the dot electron and hole wave functions ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , through the relation @xmath25 @xmath26 being the well known clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 and the eigenenergy @xmath6 are obtained from numerical diagonalization of the exciton hamiltonian in a spherical potential well , using the basis defined by equation  ( [ ocho])@xcite . if the uncorrelated theory ( model i ) is considered , for every eigenstate",
    "there is only one non - zero coefficient @xmath27 in the expansion ( [ exc : funcion ] ) .",
    "this approach leads to the same results as the formalism of  . on the other hand , models ii and iii differ upon the radial parts of the electronic wave functions @xmath23 and @xmath28 , which depend on the chosen confinement potential .",
    "the resonance condition with a particular electronic level @xmath29 is given by the equations @xmath30 ( outgoing resonance ) or @xmath31 ( incoming resonance ) . in the dipole approximation only excitons with @xmath8 are created or annihilated , corresponding to @xmath32 interband transitions in the free ehp model .",
    "if the valence band mixing is neglected , only @xmath14 vibrons contribute to the raman scattering .    the calculation of the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ ec:2 ] ) has been performed in for the case of totally confined excitons , while the strong size quantized regime ( non exciton effects ) has been developed in .",
    "the parameters used in our calculations correspond to a cds qd of radius @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this means that the dot is in the strong confinement regime . in this regime",
    "the coulomb attraction shifts the ehp energies to lower values and small changes on the wave functions are expected .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the electron and hole density of probability for the three lower @xmath8 excitonic eigenstates as functions of @xmath34 , the distance to the dot center .",
    "the density of probability in the case of the uncorrelated ehp model ( i ) is shown by dashed curve . for the @xmath35 excitonic state",
    "the effect of correlation is to push both the electron and the hole to the dot center .",
    "as can be seen , for the system under consideration ( cds qd of radius @xmath33   ) the effect of the finite confinement on the electron - hole decompensation is larger than that of the electron - hole interaction .",
    "as we shall see , if the former effect is neglected considerable changes on the predicted raman cross section absolute values are obtained . in figure  [ fig2](a )",
    "we compare the calculated raman cross- section for incoming light in resonance with the @xmath36 excitonic state following models i , ii and iii .",
    "the incoming resonances happen at @xmath37 ev in the finite barrier excitonic model iii ( solid curve ) , at @xmath38 ev in the uncorrelated ehp model i ( dashed curve ) and at @xmath39 ev for the excitonic model ii ( dot - dashed curve ) , assuming an effective radius @xmath40   to simulate the finite - barrier height .",
    "it can be seen that accurate @xmath36 exciton energy can be obtained following the formalism of model ii .",
    "the @xmath36 excitonic state , as can be seen in table  [ tab2](a ) , is mainly composed of ehp states with quantum numbers @xmath41 with a large oscillator strength @xmath42 , giving the main contribution to the cross - section in the resonance condition .",
    "the line shape is almost the same in the three models .",
    "the difference between those models lays in the absolute values of the cross - section , which is smaller in model ii .",
    "it is clear that the dominant effect on absolute values comes from : ( a ) the values of the oscillator strength@xcite ; ( b ) the ehp wave functions decompensation produced by the finite depth of the spherical well .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ fig1 ] that the electron - hole decompensation for the first level is slightly larger in model iii than the free ehp theory ( i ) , something that is reflected on the values of the exciton - vibron matrix elements reported in table  [ tab2 ] . in the case of excitons",
    "completely confined ( ii ) the exciton - vibron matrix elements @xmath43 are one order of magnitude smaller than i and iii ( see ) .",
    "however , we must note that in the case of the electrons , the effective mass in the glass matrix is five times larger than its value inside the dot , causing an extremely large decompensation .",
    "a similarly large effect can be achieved if one of the barrier heights is too small .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the raman spectrum in the case of incoming resonance with the @xmath44 exciton at @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47  ev in models i , ii and iii respectively . in i",
    ", the @xmath44 state is the free ehp with quantum numbers @xmath48 and it has a weak optical activity , as can be seen from the corresponding oscillator strength @xmath49(a ) ) and a strong incoming resonance is obtained .",
    "it must be noted that even when the matrix element @xmath50 is maximum for @xmath51 , the main contribution to the cross - section in figure  [ fig2](b ) corresponds to @xmath52 , a fact that can be explained by interference effects due to virtual transitions between @xmath44 and @xmath53 excitonic levels .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) shows that electron - hole decompensation is similar for i and iii .",
    "nevertheless a completely confined exciton theory with an effective radius gives a matrix elements @xmath50 one order of magnitude smaller than those reported in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig2](c ) shows the spectrum for the case of incoming resonance with the @xmath53 level , at @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ev in models i , ii and iii , respectively .",
    "the results of the theories considered here present great differences : ( a ) model ii predicts a cross- section smaller than that for the @xmath36 incoming resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) , while i and iii predict larger cross - sections than those of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "( b ) in model iii , the peak associated to the @xmath51 vibron becomes bigger than the @xmath52 peak . in models",
    "i and iii , because the energy of incoming resonance @xmath57 is very close to the energy of outgoing resonance with the @xmath44 excitonic state @xmath58 ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) , a quasi - double resonant condition takes place in the scattering process .",
    "hence , the raman cross - section values are strongly dependent on the matrix elements @xmath59 , which are maximum for @xmath51 , explaining why the @xmath51 peak is greatly enhanced . moreover , the @xmath52 contribution is dropped because of interference effects between @xmath44 and @xmath53 excitonic transitions mediated by the matrix elements @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "owing to symmetry , the matrix element @xmath61 vanishes in the framework of the free ehp model and the quasi - double resonance effect is not observed in figure  [ fig2](c ) .",
    "we have also calculated the spectrum in the outgoing resonance with @xmath53 , using models i and iii . in this case",
    "the double - resonance condition is not fulfilled and the obtained cross - section is similar in both models .    we have finally compared the integral raman intensity for the @xmath52 vibron of a 20   cds qd and it is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] as a function of the incident photon energy . we have used the same broadening of @xmath62 mev for all the excitonic levels .",
    "this plot takes up the effects already presented in previous figures over the absolute values of the raman spectra .",
    "the red shift of the resonances due to the attractive electron hole interaction is shown . due to the small optical oscillator strength the intensities corresponding to the incoming and outgoing resonances with the second ehp level in model i , are insignificant compared to those of the first and third levels .",
    "model iii predicts stronger resonances for the @xmath36 exciton than model i , a fact explained by the enhancement of its oscillator strength . for all models",
    "the @xmath36 outgoing resonance is stronger than the incoming one , but for the @xmath44 state the opposite is obtained .",
    "the above feature is a general result of the frhlich - like interaction in a quantum dot .",
    "the @xmath44 excitonic state has an oscillator strength equal to 1.08 , a factor about 30 times larger than for the free ehp ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) and this is the cause of the strong @xmath44 incoming resonance seen in the plot .",
    "the outgoing peak for the @xmath53 level is smaller in model iii than that of the free ehp theory .",
    "this is explained by the reduction of the electron - hole decompensation observed in model iii ( see figure  [ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "the intensities calculated according to model ii are two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the exciton in the finite - barrier models .",
    "this calculation is not presented in fig .",
    "we have studied the influence of excitonic and finite confinement effects on the first - order raman cross - sections for longitudinal optical vibrons in nanospherical semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "we have compared the predictions of three models for the intermediate electronic states : ( i ) uncorrelated electron hole pairs with finite dot confinement ; ( ii ) excitons completely confined in an spherical box with an effective radius ; ( iii ) excitons in a finite confinement barrier .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work is that the raman spectra and the resonance profile absolute values for the frhlich - type - interaction hamiltonian in qds should be predicted by a theory that takes into consideration both the finite confinement barrier height and electron - hole correlation effects . even in the strong quantum confinement regime excitons and the conduction and valence - band offsets",
    "substantially modify the features of the resonant raman spectra , particularly in presence of quasi - double resonances .",
