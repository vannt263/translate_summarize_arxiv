    "understanding bar - formation and the secular effects that bars have on the stellar component is becoming central to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . once",
    "a bar forms it can change the scale length of the stellar component via scattering / mixing of stars in the radial direction and they can create an extended stellar distribution @xcite .",
    "bars can move a galaxy between morphological classes through the secular formation of pseudo - bulges @xcite and they can drive gas to the central black hole fuelling agn ( shlosman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that bars naturally arise from the secular evolution of discs @xcite .",
    "bars can also be triggered by dynamical interactions in the field @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that close galaxy companions are associated with bar formation , but primarily for early hubble - types @xcite . in galaxy clusters , gravitational encounters ( harassment )",
    "can drive a morphological transformation from late type disks to dwarf ellipticals ( dsphs ) . in this scenario , encounters create a `` naked '' stellar bar which is subsequently heated , causing the remnants to become more spherical with time @xcite .",
    "is environment the key factor in determining why two similar galaxies may or may not have a bar or is the existence of a bar related to the initial conditions of galaxy formation ?",
    "the stability ( or instability ) of disks to bar formation may also depend on the baryon fraction , and in particular the mass of stars and gas in the disk .",
    "this varies across the hubble sequence and depends strongly on halo mass @xcite .",
    "this all suggests that in addition to local density , morphology and halo mass are also important principal parameters to investigate .",
    "another key observational result is the fact that the bar fraction is not changing significantly with redshift ( see @xcite , but also @xcite for a different result ) , however , most disk galaxies are not within dense environments so it would be difficult to disentangle the effects of environment , especially at higher redshifts .",
    "several studies have shown that there is no evidence for a dependence of bar frequency on galaxy environment @xcite , the same is true even if galaxies of different morphological type are considered independently @xcite .",
    "@xcite came to the same conclusion analyzing the clustering properties of barred and unbarred galaxies of similar stellar mass and finding it indistinguishable over all the scales probed ( from @xmath520 kpc to 30 mpc ) .",
    "more recently , the coma cluster was studied by @xcite : they find that the bar fraction does not vary significantly even when going from the center to the cluster outskirts .",
    "however , the coma cluster is such an extreme environment that most of its apparent spiral galaxy population may be field galaxies in projection .    in the light of these observational results and motivation from numerical simulation studies , we aim at measuring the bar fraction ( as number of barred discs over the total number of discs ) as a function of environment and disc morphology , at @xmath0 in two carefully selected samples representative of a low - density environment ( the isolated galaxies from the amiga sample ) and of a moderately dense environment ( galaxies in the virgo cluster ) .    to achieve this goal it is important to use homogeneous classifications since , as we have shown in giordano et al . , ( 2010 )",
    "( paperi hereafter ) , the bar fraction is very stable against sample selection but that some ( possibly spurious ) differences can arise if the comparison is based on samples classified using different methods ( for example visual classification versus automated profile fitting ) .",
    "in particular , the way the disc population is identified and isolated plays a crucial role , since , if no detailed morphological information is available , discs can easily be miscounted ( for example applying only color and/or magnitude cuts ) .    in order to address this",
    ", we use data from the ukidss large area survey @xcite and from sdss dr7 @xcite , with the great advantage of combining optical ` r`gb images with near - infrared ( h - band ) imaging with excellent resolution for local universe studies , that allow us to visually inspect the images to provide detailed morphological classifications .    ) , morphologically selected discs ( with hubble type ranging from s0 to sm ) .",
    "shaded histograms represent the barred discs.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the outline of the paper is the following : in section  [ sec.data ]",
    "we present the data that we are using , their classification and the selection of the samples based on local density estimation .",
    "the results about the bar fraction in the different cases are presented in section  [ sec.results ] and discussed in section  [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "in paperi we presented a thorough study of the barred galaxies in the virgo cluster from which we adopt all the classified galaxies with a measured h - band magnitude from 2mass .",
    "the virgo  disk sample is composed of moderately inclined ( axis ratio larger than 0.4 ) members with ukidss near - ir imaging of hubble type between s0 and sm , spanning a h - band magnitude ( stellar mass ) range of -17 to -25 mag ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 m@xmath3 ) . in the following analysis ,",
    "we use the h - band magnitudes from paper  i to compute stellar masses assuming a flat @xmath9 color with a @xmath10 .",
    "the local galaxy density for members is determined via the @xmath11 proxy @xcite , using the positions and magnitudes from the virgo cluster catalog @xcite .",
    "proxy of the na10  ( grey diamonds ) , field  ( blue square ) and virgo  ( red circle ) samples , with field  and and virgo  samples bracketing the extremes in @xmath11 of the na10  density distribution .",
    "averaged over all morphological types , the bar fraction is constant against local density.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      to provide a robust comparison to the virgo  sample , we select a true field  sample using the amiga ( analysis of the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies ) project @xcite .",
    "the amiga catalogue is based on the kig catalog @xcite of isolated galaxies ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the kig catalog is composed of 1050 galaxies with apparent blue magnitudes brighter than 15.7 mag ; these isolated galaxies are selected to have no neighbor of comparable size within twenty galactic diameters .",
    "the kig catalog has been used by multiple studies to investigate the effects of under - dense environment on galaxy properties @xcite and the amiga project quantified the isolation of kig galaxies identifying their sample of 791 genuinely isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "the amiga project has also compiled multiwavelength coverage of this statistically significant sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local universe and the dataset includes optical photometry and morphologies for a redshift - complete subsample of 956 galaxies @xcite , and these data are publicly released under a vo interface at ` http://amiga.iaa.es/ ` .    by cross - matching the amiga catalogue with the 2mass and sdss databases ,",
    "we identify 563 galaxies with both h - band and ` r`gb images . as in our virgo  sample , we select only moderately inclined ( axis ratio @xmath13 ) disk galaxies with hubble type of @xmath7 to @xmath14 .",
    "the stellar masses of the resulting 390 field  disk galaxies are determined using the total h - band magnitudes from 2mass and assuming the same flat @xmath9 color and @xmath10 as in the virgosample .",
    "the local density for each galaxy is determined by their 5th nearest neighbors ( @xmath11 , see @xcite ) as defined by the amiga catalogue of neighbors , constructed down to a magnitude @xmath1517.5 , lying within 0.5 mpc around the kig galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ukidss large area survey is an ongoing survey to image 4000 deg@xmath16 at high galactic latitudes in the yjhk filters to a depth in h of 18.8 mag ; it has a spatial resolution of 0.4@xmath17/pixel ( like sdss data ) and an average seeing of 0.8@xmath18 .",
    "our galaxies span a redshift out to @xmath190.03 where the ukidss imaging has a physical resolution of @xmath5400 pc / pixel .",
    "as outlined in paperi , we use the h - band imaging to visually classify the disk galaxies into one of three categories : `` barred '' , `` non - barred '' , or `` uncertain '' .",
    "all the galaxies in the virgo  sample have h - band imaging from ukidss that is also available for 172 galaxies in the field  sample , for the rest we must rely on sdss @xmath20 and ` rgb ` imaging ; however , for all the galaxies with both h - band and @xmath21 imaging , we find that our bar classifications are essentially identical .",
    "both virgo  and field  catalogues , comprehensive of ` rgb ` and h - band thumbnails are available online .",
    "in figure [ fig:1 ] we show the h - band luminosity distribution for moderately inclined disk galaxies in our field  and virgosamples .",
    "the barred fraction averaged over the disk population in the field  is @xmath534% ( 133/390 ) and in virgo  is @xmath528% ( 90/332 ) .",
    "we find that even with bar classifications based on high resolution near - ir imaging , the barred fraction does not vary with environment when considering the disk population as a whole .",
    "although our results are consistent with earlier work based on optical imaging ( see for example @xcite ) , the constancy of the barred fraction conflicts with expectations from current galaxy formation models , since strong interactions can trigger bar instabilities @xcite .    to further test the robustness of our result , we incorporate the @xcite optically - selected sample of about 14,000 galaxies from the sdss dr4 ; this sample includes nearly all spectroscopically - targeted galaxies in the redshift range @xmath22 to an apparent extinction - corrected limit of @xmath23 mag . in addition to visually classified hubble types , the na10  catalogue contains the existence of bars , stellar masses computed according to @xcite , and an estimate of the local density computed using the 5th nearest neighbors ( @xmath11 ) according to @xcite . to ensure that we can compare the ( optical ) na10  sample directly to our ( near - ir ) results",
    ", we apply the same disk selection criteria as in our field  and virgo  samples and consider only galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the barred fraction in our field  ( blue ) and virgo  ( red ) populations as well as the na10  sample ( grey ) as a function of local galaxy density ( @xmath11 ) ; note how effectively our field  and virgo  samples bracket the extremes in @xmath11 .",
    "we find the barred disk fraction is surprisingly resilient ( @xmath25% ) : the barred fraction does not vary as the environment changes from isolated field galaxies to cluster cores .      to investigate how the barred fraction varies with disk morphology",
    ", we divide both our field  and virgo  samples into three classes : 1 ) lenticulars ( featureless discs , corresponding to hubble - types @xmath26 ) ; 2 ) early - type spirals ( bulge - dominated discs , corresponding to hubble - types @xmath4 ) ; and 3 ) late - type spirals ( disc - dominated or bulge - less discs , corresponding to hubble - types @xmath6 ) . in figure [ fig:3 ]",
    "we show the barred fraction as a function of stellar mass for the three disk classes where the blue squares represent the field  and the red circles the virgo  members .",
    "each panel also includes the average barred fraction for the three disk classes in the field  ( dotted line ) and in virgo  ( dashed line ) .",
    "the differences in the relative number of galaxies in each disk class is due to the morphology - density relation , i.e. the fraction of lenticulars in the field  ( @xmath27% ) is lower than in virgo  ( @xmath28% ; paperi ) .",
    "we find that the barred fraction for early - type spirals is systematically higher than in late - type spirals _ regardless of environment _ : @xmath29% for @xmath4 vs. @xmath30% for @xmath6 .",
    "the barred fraction in lenticulars ( @xmath26 ) is also lower in both environments .",
    "we present the first comprehensive study of barred disks as a function of environment that uses nir and ` rgb ` imaging to resolve bars ;",
    "the advantage of using near - infrared imaging from ukidss is that bar classifications are less affected by dust and bright star - forming regions .",
    "we expand on our study of bars in virgo  by building a field  sample using the kig catalog of isolated galaxies .",
    "our field  and virgo  disk populations are at @xmath31 , span a range in stellar mass from @xmath510@xmath32 to @xmath510@xmath33 m@xmath3 and hubble type ( @xmath34 ) , encompass a wide range in local densities and are analyzed in exactly the same manner .",
    "we find that the barred disk fraction is surprisingly constant at @xmath35% in both the field  and virgo  samples , i.e. the barred fraction for the disk population as a whole does not depend on environment .",
    "we test the robustness of our result by analyzing the na10 optically - selected sample of nearby galaxies in the same manner , and we again find a constant barred fraction across the full range of local galaxy density .",
    "the barred fraction is highest for early - type spirals ( @xmath4 ) regardless of environment : these galaxies are nearly twice as likely to be barred as late - type spirals ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if a late type spiral forms a bar , then it may also form a pseudo - bulge via a buckling instability and its morphological class will change . indeed , the consensus is forming that our own galaxy has evolved across the hubble sequence in this fashion @xcite .",
    "if this is a common phenomenon , as numerical simulations indicate @xcite , then we naturally expect the bar fraction to be higher in early type spirals , that have a higher baryon fraction .",
    "this implies that a significant fraction of the bulges of early type galaxies are pseudo - bulges .",
    "the morphology - density relation @xcite can be explained by the notion that the cluster environment is creating s0 s from the infalling disc population .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that the bulge to disc ratios of s0 s is similar to that of early type galaxies .",
    "one might therefore expect the bar fraction to be the same in s0s and early type spirals , however averaged over the entire population it is significantly lower ( 25% versus 50% respectively ) .",
    "we note that the bar fraction in s0 s and early type discs with stellar masses above @xmath36 is similar ( @xmath5 50% ) , but this drops to less than 10% in the least massive s0 s .",
    "this supports a harassment scenario for the formation of the s0 population .",
    "gravitational encounters between galaxies and with the global cluster potential thicken the disks of massive early type spirals by an amount that is sufficient to suppress spiral patterns ( moore et al 1999 ) . for lower mass disks ,",
    "the heating is more effective and will eventually erase the signatures of a preexisting bar . numerical simulations also indicate that infalling late type disks will undergo an environmentally driven bar instability , however this phase is short lived with the bar experiencing subsequent heating until it becomes a de / dsph .                                                , g. , heckman , t.  m. , white , s.  d.  m. , charlot , s. , tremonti , c. , brinchmann , j. , bruzual , g. , peng , e.  w. , seibert , m. , bernardi , m. , blanton , m. , brinkmann , j. , castander , f. , csbai , i. , fukugita , m. , ivezic , z. , munn , j.  a. , nichol , r.  c. , padmanabhan , n. , thakar , a.  r. , weinberg , d.  h. , & york , d. 2003 , , 341 , 33    , a. , warren , s.  j. , almaini , o. , edge , a.  c. , hambly , n.  c. , jameson , r.  f. , lucas , p. , casali , m. , adamson , a. , dye , s. , emerson , j.  p. , foucaud , s. , hewett , p. , hirst , p. , hodgkin , s.  t. , irwin , m.  j. , lodieu , n. , mcmahon , r.  g. , simpson , c. , smail , i. , mortlock , d. , & folger , m. 2007 , , 379 , 1599                      , k. , elmegreen , d.  m. , elmegreen , b.  g. , capak , p. , abraham , r.  g. , athanassoula , e. , ellis , r.  s. , mobasher , b. , salvato , m. , schinnerer , e. , scoville , n.  z. , spalsbury , l. , strubbe , l. , carollo , m. , rich , m. , & west , a.  a. 2008 , , 675 , 1141"
