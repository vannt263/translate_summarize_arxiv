    "in the collapsar model for ib / c supernovae ( ( * ? ? ? * woosley 1993 ) ) , matter with high specific angular momentum is accreted by the already - formed black hole with a short delay .",
    "the intermediate disk structure gives rise to the formation of relativistic jets emitting the so - called long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the gamma - ray radiation is strongly relativistically beamed with opening angles of order 10 degrees .    in order for a rapidly rotating core to be present",
    ", quasi - homogeneous chemical evolution is essential .",
    "stellar evolution models show that in stars with very high initial rotation rates mixing is faster than chemical gradients are built up by nuclear burning ( for more details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yoon & langer 2005 ) ) .",
    "the angular momentum still available at this late phase of stellar evolution is the larger , the less mass and , therefore , angular momentum the progenitor star has lost during its lifetime . since radiatively driven mass loss from massive stars decreases with metallicity , this has led to the notion that low - metallicity star - forming regions should be preferred hosts of grbs .",
    "in fact , observations are beginning to support this picture ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * modjaz et al .",
    "moreover , the grb rate per unit mass increases with redshift @xmath0 .",
    "but it is not clear whether this requires any explanation other than the general increase in star formation with redshift ( up to z@xmath12 ) .",
    "in the milky way , the near - main sequence stars with the highest rotation velocities are oe / be stars . moreover , many of them rotate at @xmath190% of the critical rate .",
    "two arguments predict a larger fraction of nearly critically rotating massive stars in low - metallicity environments : ( i ) the mass ( and angular momentum ) loss rates are lower and ( ii ) , all else being equal , the radii are smaller .",
    "various comparisons of open clusters in the magellanic clouds and the galaxy have concluded ( cf .",
    "* martayan , baade & fabregat 2010 ) ) that the abundance of oe / be stars increases with decreasing metallicity @xmath2 .",
    "if one keeps in mind that rapid rotation only is a necessary , but not also sufficient , condition for a rapidly rotating o / b star to become an oe / be star , this can pass as a confirmation of the expectation . in any event , because of their emission lines , oe / be stars probably are more reliable tracers of a population of rapidly rotating ob stars than broad photospheric lines would be .",
    "therefore , oe / be stars more massive than @xmath118@xmath3 ( metallicity dependent ; ( * ? ? ? * yoon , langer & norman 2006 ) ) qualify as candidates , also at low @xmath2 .",
    "note that , perhaps , oe / be stars do not quite reach the theoretical upper mass limit for the progenitors of grbs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yoon , langer & norman 2006 ) ) .",
    "the strong relativistic beaming makes grbs observable out to extreme redshifts .",
    "but it also implies that much fewer nearby grbs are detected . therefore , while it is still relatively straightforward to determine the number of oe / be stars per smc mass and also the space density of such environments as a function of redshift can be estimated , statistics with just a few dozen entries ( grbs ) pose serious problems . nevertheless , using a distribution of beam angles determined from observations , 3 - 6 long grbs",
    "are predicted at @xmath4 per 11-year period while the observed number is 8 ( cf .",
    "* martayan et al .  2010 ) ) .",
    "since the agreement is better than 2 @xmath5 , there is no need to fine tune adjustment parameters such as the range in spectral type , from which grb progenitors are drawn , or the number , type , and star - formation level of the assumed host galaxies .",
    "but the excellent agreement could still be coincidental .",
    "in addition to the challenges already mentioned , a number of other questions still warrant further examination :      do oe / be stars really preserve their large intial angular momentum throughout their evolution ?",
    "after all , they regularly eject rotationally supported disks .",
    "this behavior is not observed in on / bn stars , i.e.  rapidly rotating o / b stars without emission lines ."
