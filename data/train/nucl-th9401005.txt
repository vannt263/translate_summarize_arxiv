    "recently , some experimental and theoretical analyses claimed the discovery of a new type of collective excitations , the soft dipole mode , in nuclei far from stability .",
    "it seems probable now , that in certain nuclei , near the neutron drip line , a dilute neutron halo with large spatial extension can exist around a compact core @xcite ; e.g.  in @xmath3li and @xmath0he two neutrons form the neutron halo around the @xmath4li and @xmath5he cores , respectively . shortly after their discovery it was predicted that the oscillation of the halo neutrons against the core can produce collective excited states in these nuclei @xcite .",
    "these collective states are thought to be similar to the giant dipole resonances , where the neutrons of a nucleus oscillate against its protons . in the neutron halo nuclei",
    "the restoration force is weak ( soft ) , which leads to low - frequency , viz .",
    "low - energy ( 1 - 5 mev ) states compared to the giant dipole resonances ( @xmath6 20 mev ) .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the experimental and theoretical studies confirm the existence of these low - energy soft dipole modes .",
    "however , all these works without exception conclude for the existence of these states from the behavior of certain quantities ( bound state approximated energies and electric dipole strengths @xcite , excitation cross sections @xcite , dipole sum rules @xcite , etc . ) at real energies , i.e.  they are all indirect evidences of the soft dipole mode , thus they are far from being unambigous .",
    "for instance , recently we demonstrated @xcite that the possibility of resonance+scattering type asymptotic behaviors in a three - body system can lead to an apparent , resonance - like structure in the three - body continuum . to show up a direct proof for the existence of the soft dipole mode ,",
    "we must find three - body resonant poles of the scattering matrix at compex energies with the predicted properties ( excitation energy , decay width , spin - parity ) .",
    "in this paper we search for three - body resonances in @xmath0he using the complex scaling method . in order to test our method",
    ", we study the @xmath0li and @xmath0be nuclei , as well .",
    "our model is a microscopic three - cluster ( @xmath7 ) approach to the six - nucleon systems .",
    "the trial function of the six - body problem has the form @xmath8_s \\chi ^{i(jk)}_{[l_1l_2]l } ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho $ } _ 1 , \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho $ } _ 2)\\right ] _ { jm}\\right \\ } , \\label{wfn}\\ ] ] where the @xmath9 , and @xmath10 indices denote any one of the labels @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , and the first sum runs over all possible different arrangements of the clusters [ @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the case of @xmath0he , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 in the case of @xmath0li , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the case of @xmath0be ] . in ( [ wfn ] )",
    "@xmath21 is the intercluster antisymmetrizer , the @xmath22 cluster internal states are translation invariant harmonic oscillator shell model states , the vectors are the different intercluster jacobi coordinates , and [  ] denotes angular momentum coupling . in the sum over @xmath23 , and @xmath24 we should include all angular momentum configurations of any significance .",
    "it is of prime importance to choose a nucleon - nucleon interaction which is appropriate for all subsystems appearing in the model space @xcite .",
    "we choose the minnesota interaction @xcite , containing central , coulomb , and spin - orbit terms , with the parameters as in @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite , that using the size parameter @xmath25 for the @xmath11 particle , which minimizes its internal energy , together with the exchange mixture parameter @xmath26 of the minnesota force , the experimental @xmath27 phase shifts can be excellently reproduced ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this force also gives very good phase shifts in the @xmath28@xmath29 , and @xmath30@xmath31 ( j=0,1,2 ) states of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 systems .",
    "since our interaction can not account for the charge independence breaking of the @xmath34 force due to the different @xmath35 and @xmath36 pion masses , our @xmath37 phase shifts are slightly worse than the @xmath32 and @xmath33 ones ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it was emphasized in @xcite that the minnesota force is inappropriate in the @xmath30@xmath38 @xmath39 state , because it reproduces the ground state of the deuteron without the tensor coupling of the @xmath30@xmath40 state .",
    "this leads to a too strong interaction in the @xmath30@xmath38 @xmath39 state .",
    "fortunately , in @xmath0he and @xmath0be a triplet - even state can not be present between the outer neutrons and protons , respectively , thus this problem does not appear . in @xmath0li",
    ", however , we have to pay definite attention to this problem .",
    "we neglect the tensor force because there is no firm ground to determine its parameters . for test purposes we shall use the tensor force of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reproduces the @xmath41 order of the low - energy @xmath30@xmath31 phase shifts @xcite .    in a similar model @xcite but",
    "using three size parameters for the @xmath11 ( allowing two monopole excited states in addition to the ground state ) and also including rearrangement ( 3 + 3 nucleon ) channels , we got excellent results for the ground state of @xmath0he and its ( bound state approximated ) isobar analogues in @xmath0li and @xmath0be . in that work we demonstrated that the high - lying 3 + 3 rearrangement channels are responsible for the 0.3 - 0.6 mev energy lack appearing in the three - body models of the @xmath42 nuclei ( for a recent review of the three - body models see @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath0he wave function of @xcite was used in the study of the beta delayed deuteron emission from @xmath0he , and proved to give good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the use of that huge model space would be hardly managable computationally , and would cause numerical instabilities in the present work . using only one size parameter for the @xmath11 particle , and no rearrangements , we can keep the excellent reproduction of the @xmath27 phase shifts , which means that the description of the dynamics of the two - body subsystems is correct .",
    "the price , we have to pay for this model space reduction , is that the two - neutron separation energy in the ground state of @xmath0he is not correct , being 0.670 mev to be compared to the experimental value 0.975 mev .",
    "we could get closer to the experiment including the @xmath43 rearrangement channel . however , the inclusion of this channel into the @xmath0he wave function require the good reproduction of the @xmath44 phase shifts in a @xmath45 coupled channel model @xcite . although , using three @xmath11 size parameters we got excellent @xmath44 phase shifts in such a model @xcite , using only one @xmath11 size parameter it is no longer possible .",
    "the source of the problem is probably the change of the threshold splitting between the @xmath44 and @xmath46 channels .",
    "we emphasize that requiring the good reproduction of the @xmath39 and @xmath27 data , there is no remaining free parameter left in the model .",
    "the next step is to find a method which can handle three - body resonances .",
    "there are indirect and direct ways of doing that .",
    "the indirect methods , e.g.  @xcite , study the three - body problem at real energies , and extract resonance parameters from the three - body phase shifts . in the direct methods the aim is to find the complex energy poles of the three - body scattering matrix .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors determined the pole positions of the three - body @xmath47-matrix by analytically continuing the homogenous faddeev - equation to complex energies . to get a decisive answer to the question of the soft dipole mode of @xmath0he",
    ", we must use a direct method .",
    "our choice is the complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "this method reduces the problem of resonant states to that of bound states , and can handle the coulomb interaction , which causes enormous difficulties in the faddeev framework , without any problem .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently , that the csm can be used to find three - body resonances in such problems which are very similar to our present situation @xcite .",
    "here we recall only the main points of the csm , the details can be found in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "suppose , we search for ( @xmath48-body ) resonant states of the hamiltonian @xmath49 . we define a new hamiltonian by @xmath50 where the @xmath51 unbounded similarity transformation acts , in the coordinate space , on a function @xmath52 as @xmath53 ( if @xmath54 is real , @xmath51 means a rotation into the complex coordinate plane , if it is complex , it means a rotation and scaling . ) in the case of a many - body hamiltonian , ( [ cs ] ) means that the transformation has to be performed in each jacobi coordinate .",
    "if the potential is dilation analytic @xcite , then there is the following connection between the spectra of @xmath49 and @xmath55 @xcite : ( i ) the bound eigenstates of @xmath49 are the eigenstates of @xmath55 , for any value of @xmath54 within @xmath56 ; ( ii ) the continuous spectrum of @xmath49 will be rotated by an angle 2@xmath54 ; ( iii ) the complex generalized eigenvalues of @xmath55 , @xmath57 , e,@xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the full width at half maximum ) belong to its proper spectrum , with square - integrable eigenfunctions , provided @xmath60 . in nuclear physics",
    "the csm has been successfully applied in the rgm description of @xmath61be @xcite , in an ocm model of @xmath62ne @xcite , and in the ocm description of the resonances of @xmath63li @xcite .",
    "since the resonant wave functions become localized in the csm , we can use any bound - state method to describe them . here",
    "we use an expansion of the wave function , in terms of products of tempered gaussian functions of the jacobi coordinates , in a variational method @xcite .",
    "a typical term of this expansion looks like @xmath64y_{l_1m_1}(\\widehat \\rho_1)\\cdot \\rho_2^{l_2 } \\exp [ -(\\rho_2/\\gamma_j)^2]y_{l_2m_2 } ( \\widehat \\rho_2)$ ] , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the angular momenta in the two relative motions , respectively , and the widths @xmath67 of the gaussians are the parameters of the expansion .",
    "we choose ten @xmath67 parameters in each relative motion , and they follow a geometric progression @xcite with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we have carried out calculations for the @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 states in the @xmath42 nuclei . in order to keep all important angular momentum channels in eq.([wfn ] ) , and at the same time keep the size of the problem manageble , we should know the contribution of each channel to the total wave functions .",
    "that is why we first made real energy calculations ( i.e. , without complex scaling ) for the above - mentioned states , using square - integrable trial functions .",
    "the resulting weights of the different orthogonal @xmath76 components are in table [ tab1 ] . the number of different @xmath77 configurations in eq .",
    "( [ wfn ] ) was typically 10 - 12 , most of them are non - orthogonal to each other .",
    "we calculated the amount of their clustering , which measure the weights of the different non - orthogonal channels @xcite , and kept the most important 5 - 6 channels in the complex calculations .",
    "in @xmath0li we left out all angular momentum configuration which contain triplet - even state between the outer proton and neutron .",
    "the inclusion of the configurations which contain the @xmath30@xmath38 @xmath37 state ( e.g.  @xmath78 in the @xmath72 state of @xmath0li ) would suppress all other channels because , the minnesota force is too strong in this @xmath37 state .",
    "for example , this would lead to 99.8 % weight of the @xmath79 component in the @xmath72 state of @xmath0li , while without this @xmath80 configuration the weight is only 0.5 % , as we can see in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "with their omission we dropped only a tiny part of the model space , because these components have large overlaps with the non - orthogonal angular momentum configurations in the @xmath81 and @xmath82 partitions @xcite . without a tensor force ,",
    "the omission of the configurations which contain the @xmath30@xmath40 @xmath37 state , almost does not change anything . if a tensor force and the @xmath30@xmath40 @xmath37 components ( e.g.  the @xmath83 configuration in the @xmath71 state of @xmath0li ) were present ,",
    "the @xmath0li would become @xmath610 mev overbound .",
    "this is because our force would lead to a @xmath610 mev overbinding in the case of the @xmath30@xmath84@xmath30@xmath40 coupled deuteron , itself .",
    "although , we have no explicit @xmath30@xmath38 @xmath37 state in @xmath0li , the coupling of the @xmath83 state to the @xmath85 channels , which are non - orthogonal to the omitted @xmath86 component , would result in this @xmath610 mev overbinding of @xmath0li . with the omission of the triplet - even @xmath37 components in @xmath0li , these problems do not appear , but the @xmath71 ground state becomes @xmath61 mev underbind .",
    "so , in conclusion , there is definitely room for improvements in @xmath0li .",
    "the parameters of all three - body resonances which we found are listed in table [ tab2 ] , along with the experimental energies and widths .",
    "we solved the complex scaled schrdinger equations with different @xmath54 rotation angles . without approximations , the resulting pole position would not depend on @xmath54 . using an approximate method ( in our case a variational method ) ,",
    "the pole position slightly depend on @xmath54 , and the stationary point of the @xmath54-trajectory should be accepted as the position of the resonance @xcite .",
    "our best @xmath54 values were around 0.25 - 0.3 radian .",
    "as a consequence of our not complete model space , which resulted in the @xmath61 mev underbinding in the the ground state of @xmath0li , the @xmath71 resonance is pushed to higher energy , considerably increasing its width .",
    "the same underbinding effect which appeared in the ground state of @xmath0he pushes the slightly bound @xmath70 state of @xmath0li into the continuum , resulting a three - body resonance .",
    "the experimentally known @xmath72 state of @xmath0li at e=0.610 mev with @xmath59=1.7 mev can not be resolved by our present method because the pole at @xmath87 mev is mixed up with the points of the rotated discretized continuum , using any rotation parameter .",
    "the agreement of the resonance parameters with the experimental values is good for the @xmath72 states of @xmath0he , @xmath0li , and @xmath0be , and the @xmath70 state of @xmath0be .",
    "it is important to note that while our interaction underbinds the @xmath70 state of @xmath0he by about 0.3 mev , the @xmath72 state is `` overbound '' by about 0.1 mev ( and its width is smaller than the experimental value , accordingly ) .",
    "it means that the sometimes usual way to refit the interaction strength so as to get the correct binding energy for the ground state is dangerous . in our present case it would result in the parameters @xmath88 mev and @xmath89 mev for the @xmath72 state",
    "the best thing we can do is to accept the results , coming from an interaction which is good for the subsystems , as they are . to test the effect of the tensor interaction , we performed a calculation for the @xmath72 state of @xmath0he with the tensor force of @xcite included .",
    "it resulted in @xmath90 mev and @xmath91 mev parameters , thus it has small effect .",
    "to illustrate the working mechanism of our method , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the results of the calculations for the @xmath72 and @xmath71 state in @xmath0li . as we can see , the rotated discretized continuum is a mixture of the three - body scattering continuum points , starting at the origin , and the resonance+scattering continua , starting at the @xmath92 and @xmath93 resonance positions of the @xmath94he and @xmath94li subsystems , respectively @xcite .",
    "the probably not accurate enough double precision numerics and the interaction between the continua , which are close to each other , makes the picture a bit fuzzy , but the identification of the resonant states is unambiguous .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show our result for the @xmath74 state of @xmath0he , where the soft dipole mode was predicted at @xmath95 mev ( @xmath96 mev , @xmath97 mev , @xcite ) .",
    "as we can see , our model does not confirm the existence of such a state .",
    "no resonant state occured while increasing the @xmath54 value to as large as 0.7 , where the csm becomes unstable .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , where the authors did not find any indication for the existence of a @xmath74 state , analyzing the @xmath0he strength functions and break - up cross sections at real energies .    in the literature",
    "there are works for the @xmath42 nuclei in which the three - body resonance parameters are extracted from real energy phase shifts @xcite , and faddeev calculations @xcite , respectively .",
    "the results of these works are consistent with each other and with ours , except that in @xcite , in addition to the well - known @xmath70 ground state and @xmath72 excited state , the authors found low - lying narrow @xmath70 and @xmath71 excited states in @xmath0be , a fact which we try to explain later .",
    "in @xcite we argued that we can identify three - body resonances using the fact that they have to appear in each possible jacobi coordinate system . here , using the @xmath72 state of @xmath0he , we check this claim . switching off all @xmath14 and @xmath15 channels , respectively",
    ", the resonance occurs at @xmath98 mev and @xmath99 mev , respectively .",
    "if we keep only the @xmath100 channels , we get the resonance at @xmath101 mev , while keeping only the @xmath102 configurations the resonance appears at @xmath103 mev .",
    "thus , our present model shows that the three - body resonances appear not just in every different jacobi coordinate systems , but in every different @xmath76 configuration .",
    "it means that a @xmath74 three - body resonance , if exists , must show up even if our model space were very restrictive .    to sum up our results",
    ", we have found the experimentally known resonances , but not found any indication that the @xmath74 soft dipole mode exists in @xmath0he . in the next section",
    "we give a possible explanation of the experimental finding of soft dipole resonances in neutron halo nuclei .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that if there are resonances in a two - body subsystem of a three - body system , then the sequentially decay of the system through these resonant states leads to structures in the three - body continuum , in addition to the structures coming from the three - body resonances .",
    "this is because around the two - body resonance energy , in addition to the three - body phase space , a substantial two - body phase space is available for the system to decay into .",
    "we emphasize , that these structures have kinematical , rather than dynamical origin .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71 excited states of @xmath0be , found in @xcite , are nice examples to demonstrate the operation of the sequential decay mode .",
    "the model wave function of @xcite consists of @xmath30he+@xmath30he and @xmath94li+@xmath13 channels with , bound state approximated , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath104 @xmath94li states .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71 resonances of @xcite in the @xmath0be phase shifts are apparent .",
    "they are the consequence of the fact that the @xmath94li+@xmath13 asymptotic decay modes are built into the wave function .",
    "these states are sequential decay modes , having two - body dynamical structures .",
    "thus , these are not three - body resonances in @xmath0be . in a similar work",
    "@xcite the method of the hyperspherical harmonics does not allow sequential decay modes , that is why the authors did not find excited @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the @xmath0be phase shifts .",
    "we can conclude from our results that it is possible that the soft dipole mode does not exist in @xmath0he , and the experiments see only the @xmath94he+@xmath12 sequential decay mode of this nucleus .",
    "we show that there is no experimental finding which contradicts our assumption .    in @xmath0he",
    "the sequential decay mode leads to a superposition of the @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94he states and the neutron in the final state .",
    "the angular momentum of the relative motion is most probably @xmath105 to avoid the centrifugal barrier . as a consequence , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 structures can appear in the excitation function of @xmath0he . from the @xmath70 ground state",
    ", only the @xmath74 state can be excited conventionally , the other two states can only be excited by parity transfer e.g.  by using pions . due to the splitting of the @xmath92 and @xmath93 states of @xmath94he ( these states are at 0.89 mev and 4 mev @xcite , respectively )",
    ", two @xmath74 bumps can appear in the excitation function of @xmath0he at 0.975 + 0.89 @xmath106 1.9 mev and 0.975 + 4 @xmath106 5 mev excitation energies , respectively ( 0.975 mev is the two - neutron separation energy of @xmath0he ) .",
    "in recent experimets @xcite a @xmath74 structure appeared around 6 mev , and the well - known @xmath72 state at 1.8 mev .",
    "the position of the @xmath74 bump is in good agreement with our prediction , while our other structure at 1.9 mev coincides with the position of the @xmath72 state .",
    "we can see in fig .  2 of @xcite that the assumption of a mixed @xmath72 and @xmath74 nature of the bump at 1.8 mev is not in contradiction with the measured angular distribution , on the contrary",
    ", it would improve the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "let us point out that a similar situation may occur in @xmath3li . here",
    "the sequential decay mode leads to @xmath63li+@xmath13 final states .",
    "there are several measurements for the low - lying resonances of @xmath63li ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the most recent ref .",
    "@xcite , which seems to be the most reliable , gives a @xmath71 state at 0.42 mev , and a @xmath72 state at 0.8 mev excitation energies .",
    "the most recent value of the two - neutron separation energy of @xmath3li is 0.295@xmath1070.035 mev @xcite .",
    "the sequential decay mode can lead to structures around 0.42 + 0.29 @xmath106 0.7 and 0.8 + 0.29 @xmath106 1.1 mev @xmath3li excitation energies .",
    "assuming again that the @xmath105 angular momentum between @xmath63li and @xmath12 is preferred , the possible @xmath108 values are @xmath109 and @xmath104 at 0.7 mev , and @xmath109 , @xmath104 , and @xmath110 at 1.1 mev .",
    "all of these @xmath108 states can be excited from the @xmath92 ground state of @xmath3li without parity transfer , which means that the experimental structure is a coherent superposition of them . in @xcite",
    "a bump occured in the @xmath3li excitation spectrum around 1.2 mev excitation energy .",
    "the position and the experimentally observed @xmath109 , @xmath104 , or @xmath110 spin - parity character of this state are again in good agreement with our result . in @xcite a state in @xmath63li",
    "is also found around 4 mev , and in @xcite we can see some structures in this energy region , too .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors studied the coulomb break - up of @xmath3li on pb target .",
    "they found that the average velocity of the outcoming @xmath4li nuclei is larger than the average velocity of the outcoming neutrons .",
    "they explained this by the post acceleration of the @xmath4li nuclei in the field of the lead target nucleus . from the large velocity shift they concluded that the breakup process should be direct , not resonant through the presumed soft dipole mode .",
    "if the sequential decay mode causes the apparent resonance - like structure in @xmath3li , as we assume , then the post acceleration is felt by the @xmath63li particle ( and not by the other neutron ) , thus the average neutron velocity can be smaller than that of the @xmath4li velocity . in fig .",
    "14 of @xcite one can see two peaks of the velocity shift curve .",
    "the larger shift is probably due to the direct breakup ( the three - body scattering final state ) , while the other peak at much smaller shift can account for the sequential decay .",
    "the complete kinematical measurement of @xcite would allow a stringent test of our assumption that there is no soft dipole mode in @xmath3li , only a sequential decay mode .",
    "in the center of mass frame one should see a considerable increase of the 180 degree angular correlation between @xmath4li and neutrons around the 1.2 mev excitation of @xmath3li .",
    "in summary , we have searched for low - energy three - body resonances in @xmath0he , @xmath0li , and @xmath0be , using the complex scaling method in a microscopic three - cluster model .",
    "our model can account both for the correct nuclear physics and the proper three - body dynamics .",
    "we have found the experimentally known resonances , except a @xmath72 state of @xmath0li , which can not be localized by our present method .",
    "however , we have not found the predicted @xmath74 soft dipole mode in @xmath0he .",
    "we argued that this state , if exists , should appear even in a model which is much simpler than ours .",
    "we concluded from our result , that it is possible that the soft dipole modes of the neutron halo nuclei do not exist , and the experiments see just the sequential decay modes of these nuclei .",
    "we have shown , through the examples of @xmath0he and @xmath3li that there is no experimental fact which contradicts this assumption .",
    "a test of our assumption could come from the analysis of the experimental core ",
    "neutron angular correlation in break - up reactions .",
    "if the sequential decay mode has a significant effect , then a strong increase of the 180 degree correlation in the center of mass frame should be found around the `` resonance '' energies .",
    "finally , we mention that the importance of the sequential decay modes was pointed out in @xcite , claiming that the broad part of the momentum distribution of the projectile fragments in the neutron halo nuclei probably comes from these modes .",

    "<S> we argue that the sequential decay mode of @xmath0he through the resonant states of its two - body subsystem can lead to peaks in the excitation function . </S>",
