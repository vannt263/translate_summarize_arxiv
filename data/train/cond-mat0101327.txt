    "glassy systems are characterized by an equilibration time that is much longer than any laboratory time scale : glasses are out of equilibrium systems .",
    "one of the interesting consequences is that , in any case for short times after a quench into the glassy phase , the properties of a glass may still evolve on an observable time scale : we say that the system _ ages_. the typical relaxation time of the glass does not become infinite immediately , but grows with the waiting time @xmath0 , i.e. , the time expired after the quench into the glassy phase was done .",
    "understanding the aging processes is of great interest as the glass transition is still ill - understood .",
    "recent progress in mode - coupling theory has allowed for a first detailed description of the aging process  @xcite .",
    "the aging dynamics of the system is described in term of the evolution of the correlation and response functions with the waiting time . in most systems such as structural glasses ,",
    "unfortunately correlation and response functions are not easy to obtain experimentally .",
    "testing the applicability of the new mode coupling theory has therefore been limited to specific theoretical models and simulations ( lennard - jones glass ) studies  @xcite .",
    "colloidal glasses can be looked upon as model glasses compared to structural glasses where there are two coupled control parameters , density and temperature . in colloidal glasses , the volume fraction of the particles is one of the control parameters that can be varied independently from the others . because of the experimental difficulties in studying structural glasses , colloidal glasses have been studied extensively . in fact , it is probably fair to say that the strongest evidence for the applicability of classical mode coupling theory ( that applies only above the glass transition temperature and therefore can not describe aging ) comes from colloidal systems  @xcite .    in order to see",
    "whether colloidal glasses can also be used to investigate aging processes , we study colloidal suspensions of laponite , a synthetic clay composed of monodisperse disc - shaped particles .",
    "these colloidal suspensions form very viscous phases at low particle concentrations  @xcite .",
    "the first evidence of aging in colloidal glasses of laponite was reported in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present quantitative results of aging dynamics in a glassy suspension of laponite using dynamic light scattering measurements and viscometry .",
    "the experiments are performed with aqueous suspensions of laponite rd , a hectorite synthetic clay provided by laporte ltd .",
    "the particles are colloidal disks of @xmath1 nm diameter and @xmath2 nm thickness  @xcite , with a negative surface charge on both faces .",
    "laponite powder was mixed with ultra - pure water at ph = 10 obtained by addition of naoh , providing chemically stable particles  @xcite .",
    "the suspension was stirred vigorously during 15 minutes and then filtered through a millipore millex - aa 0.8 @xmath3 m filter unit .",
    "this preparation procedure allows us to obtain a reproducible initial liquid state .",
    "evaporation of water or co@xmath4 contamination of the sample was completely avoided by covering the sample with a layer of vaseline oil .",
    "the aging time @xmath5 is defined as the moment the suspension passes through the filter .",
    "suspensions prepared in this way are optically transparent and are initially liquid . within a time varying from a few minutes to a few hours for the different concentrations considered here (",
    "@xmath6 wt to @xmath7 wt ) , a three order of magnitude increase in viscosity is observed : the suspension does not flow anymore when tumbling the recipient . since the physical properties of the dispersion depend on the time after preparation @xmath0 , the conclusion is that the samples age . that the origin of this aging behavior is due to the glassy dynamics was shown by bonn _",
    "et al . _",
    "they showed that laponite suspensions form glasses and not gels , as had been proposed before  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the structure of laponite suspensions using static light scattering .",
    "contrary to previous observations , they found no evidence for a fractal - like organization of the particles , provided the suspensions were filtered .",
    "they consequently showed that the large viscosity increase is _ not _ due to the formation of a fractal network .",
    "in addition , it has been shown recently that laponite powder dissolves quickly into both individual particles and aggregates of a few particles dispersing more slowly  @xcite . at the final state of dispersion ( about 5 hours ) , the system contains aggregates responsible for the strong scattering at small scattering vectors . in our experiments , aggregates of particles",
    "are broken up by the filtration .",
    "this colloidal glass is obtained for very low volume fractions @xmath8 compared to those for usual spherical colloids , for which glasses are obtained above @xmath9  @xcite . to account for this difference",
    ", it was proposed  @xcite that the laponite suspensions form so - called wigner glasses , very low - density glasses whose formation is due to the existence of long - range coulombic repulsions  @xcite .",
    "these repulsions originate from the strong surface charges at the faces of the colloidal disks , making that the effective volume fraction is very high .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the location of the `` glass transition '' line in the ( volume fraction / electrolyte concentration ) phase diagram is consistent with this assumption  @xcite .    the laponite suspensions age on time scales that depend on the particle concentration .",
    "oscillatory shear experiments were performed on a controlled stress ( reologica stresstech ) rheometer using a couette geometry with a 1 mm gap .",
    "the sample was exposed to a sinusoidal strain @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 s@xmath13 , and allowing for measurement of the visco - elastic response .",
    "the storage modulus @xmath14 and the loss modulus @xmath15 were determined in the linear visco - elastic regime . at @xmath5 , the loss and storage moduli are roughly of the same order of magnitude with @xmath16 . as the system ages",
    ", the storage modulus increases more rapidly than the loss modulus , becoming easily more than two orders of magnitude larger within a typical experimental time scale .",
    "figure [ complexvis ] shows the evolution of the complex viscosity @xmath17 , as a function of the aging time @xmath0 , for suspensions with different concentrations .",
    "the complex viscosity @xmath17 was calculated from the visco - elastic moduli , as @xmath18 .",
    "the complex viscosity of the suspension with @xmath19 wt increases by three orders of magnitude on a time scale of 100 minutes while the same increase of viscosity arises on about 10 minutes for a suspension with @xmath20 wt .",
    "the aging dynamics of the suspensions can therefore be varied by changing the particle concentration .",
    "the dynamics of formation of the colloidal glass was investigated using dynamic light scattering ( dls ) .",
    "the light scattering set - up is as follows : a he - ne laser beam ( @xmath21 nm ) is focused on a cylindrical sample in an index - matching bath of toluene ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the scattered intensity transmitted through the cell is detected by an optical fiber coupled to an avalanche photodiode under a scattering angle @xmath23 , defined as the angle between the transmitted and the scattered beam . the signal is then analysed by a alv-5000 logarithmic correlator , which directly calculates the normalized intensity autocorrelation function over nine decades in time @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the delay time .",
    "the modulus of the scattering wave vector , defined as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the refractive index of the suspension ( @xmath28 ) was between @xmath29 , as the scattering angle was varied between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "its inverse , @xmath32 , determines the length scale probed in a dls experiment .    in our experiments ,",
    "the intensity correlation function was recorded while the system is aging .",
    "in such an experiment , the acquisition time should allow for a good average of the auto - correlation function data without a significant aging of the system occuring during the experiment .",
    "because of that , experiments were performed with suspensions of sufficiently low concentration so that the aging is slow compared to the time necessary to obtain the correlation functions . in the following , we present results obtained with a @xmath33 wt suspension .",
    "the acquisition time was chosen to be @xmath34 seconds , allowing for a good average of the whole curve .",
    "we experimentally checked that aging was negligible during this acquisition time for the @xmath35 wt suspension by recording the auto - correlation functions just before and just after the measurement .",
    "auto - correlation functions taken for various aging times @xmath0 , under a scattering angle @xmath36 , are shown in figure  [ inserfit ] . mainly two relaxations can be observed .",
    "the first one , observed for short delay times @xmath25 , is relatively fast and appears to be independent on the aging time . the second relaxation , observed for long delay times @xmath25 , depends strongly on the waiting time .    in order to describe the two processes quantitatively , @xmath37 ,",
    "was fitted by a sum of an exponential and a stretched exponential function as : @xmath38 the stretched exponential is used since it has been found empirically that it provides a good description of the slow relaxation processes encountered in glassy systems . the fits corresponding to different aging times",
    "@xmath0 are shown in figure  [ inserfit ] and describe the correlation functions very well , for all aging times .",
    "the first term of the fit function corresponds to a fast relaxation .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 was in fact determined independently by a linear fit of @xmath40 for short times @xmath25 , in order to constrain the fitting procedure .",
    "this relaxation time was found to be independent on the aging time @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , studying the angular dependence of the scattering , it is found that the inverse of @xmath39 varies as @xmath41 as shown in figure  [ tau1 ] .",
    "this shows that , for short times , the laponite particles undergo normal brownian motion : this q - dependence is the same as that found for very dilute colloidal dispersions  @xcite ; for our system , we find a collective diffusion coefficient @xmath42 m@xmath43 s@xmath13 , of the same order of magnitude as the one measured in a very dilute solution  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the relaxation time @xmath44 , that characterizes the aging , was found to increase exponentially fast as a function of @xmath0 as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 ms and @xmath47  s ( figure  [ inserttau2 ] ; see also the discussion below ) .",
    "as the total decay time of the correlation function is a measure for the time a particle needs to `` forget '' its initial position , this shows that very rapidly , the aging freezes in a certain degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "as was the case for @xmath39 , the relaxation time @xmath44 was found also to scale with @xmath48 , a feature again reminiscent of classical ( fickian ) diffusion , although the stretched exponential shows that there are strong hydrodynamic interactions between the particles .",
    "finally , the stretch exponent @xmath49 was found to depend only on the aging time and not on the scattering wavevector @xmath50 .",
    "the exponent @xmath49 decreases roughly linearly between @xmath2 and @xmath51 , as shown in figure [ alpha ] .",
    "the aging time @xmath0 for which @xmath52 corresponds to the ergodic - nonergodic transition on the laboratory time scale  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the scaling of @xmath39 and @xmath44 with @xmath53 allows us to rescale the autocorrelation functions for different scattering angles .",
    "rescaling the time @xmath25 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the radius of the laponite particles , leads to a collapse of the different correlation functions ( figure  [ scale ] ) .    in order to interpret these results ,",
    "we determine the distribution of relaxation times @xmath56 in the system .",
    "this we do using a commercially available constrained regularization method ( alv - nonlin data analysis  @xcite ) .",
    "the method consists in decomposing the intensity autocorrelation function in exponential modes by directly inverting : @xmath57 , yielding the distribution function of decay times @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ decay ] shows the decay time distribution functions @xmath58 corresponding to different aging times @xmath5 and @xmath60 min .",
    "one observes two distinct modes , the fast one corresponding to the first relaxation time @xmath39 , and the slow one to @xmath44 .",
    "the intensity fast mode has been arbitrarily normalised to unity for the sake of comparison .",
    "this fast mode remains almost unchanged as the system ages .",
    "the slow relaxation exhibits two different features .",
    "first , the maximum of the distribution shifts to larger times , which corresponds to the increase in @xmath44 already observed from the direct fit of the correlation function .",
    "second , the distribution of relaxation times @xmath58 becomes wider as the system ages .",
    "this corresponds in fact to the decrease in the stretch exponent @xmath49 : the distribution of relaxation times @xmath56 becomes wider and wider .",
    "these two combined effects make that , very rapidly , the longest relaxation time in the system exceeds the laboratory time scale of observation .",
    "the direct consequence of this is that , for short aging times @xmath0 , the correlation function decays to zero as shown in figure  [ inserfit ] . for",
    "longer aging times ( @xmath61 hours for a @xmath62 wt suspension ) , the auto - correlation function does not decay to zero within the observation time scale : the system is no longer ergodic  @xcite .    experimentally , the dependence of @xmath44 and @xmath17 on @xmath0 leads to the consequence that the viscosity of the suspension is not simply proportional to @xmath44 as usually assumed in simulations  @xcite ( figure  [ viscotau2 ] ) .",
    "we propose the following interpretation of our measurements . the diffusion of particles can be described as a cage - diffusion process .",
    "the first relaxation @xmath39 characterizes the short - time brownian diffusion of a particle in the suspending liquid . for short times",
    "@xmath25 , the particle diffuses freely within a cage formed by the surrounding particles .",
    "this diffusive motion consequently does not depend on the aging time .",
    "the second relaxation process , occurring for long times @xmath25 , can be interpreted as the escape from the cages .",
    "the corresponding characteristic time @xmath44 increases rapidly with @xmath0 , indicating that it becomes more and more difficult for a particle to escape. this characteristic relaxation time was found also to scale as @xmath53 , reminescent of diffusive motion . however , this diffusive motion of particles for long times is complex as it is characterized by a broad distribution of relaxation times , leading to the stretched exponential behavior of the correlation function . from this",
    "it follows immediately that for short aging times , the system is ergodic : the particles reside in the cages formed by surrounding particles and escape from them after a characteristic time that depends on the aging time @xmath0 . as the system ages , the escape from the cages becomes slower . the particles are subsequently constrained by the cages , resulting in an ergodicity breaking within the observation time scale .",
    "the comparison of our experimental results with predictions from mct  @xcite shows a qualitative agreement with respect to the slow relaxation ( so - called @xmath49-relaxation ) and faster relaxation ( so - called @xmath63-relaxation ) features of the particle dynamics .",
    "the non - aging @xmath63-relaxation part would correspond to the relaxation time @xmath39 which is independent of the aging time @xmath0 .",
    "only the slow @xmath49-relaxation part of the autocorrelation function is predicted to depend on @xmath0 , which is consistent with the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath0 . as in the mct scenario",
    ", we found that the typical relaxation time @xmath44 increases with increasing @xmath0 , which leads to a non - ergodic system when the largest @xmath44 is comparable to the observation time scale .",
    "in other experiments on aging  @xcite , the systems were found to relax on typical time scales that increase as @xmath64 , in agreement with calculations from mean field models of aging  @xcite . when @xmath65 , the process of aging is called sub - aging ; this situation is encountered in spin glasses  @xcite , in concentrated colloidal suspension  @xcite or polymer glasses  @xcite .",
    "recently , diffusing wave spectroscopy ( dws ) measurements of the motion of the tracer particles in glassy laponite suspensions have also been performed  @xcite .",
    "the measurements show that the slow collective relaxation time scales linearly with the waiting time @xmath0 ( so that @xmath66 ) called full aging .",
    "interestingly , in our experiments , the typical relaxation time @xmath44 is found to grow exponentially fast with @xmath0 .",
    "the log - log inset plot of figure  [ inserttau2 ] shows that indeed our data are inconsistent with a power law @xmath67 . in our experiments ,",
    "the typical decay time @xmath44 of the slow relaxation is of the order of 1 to 10 ms and is consequently seven orders of magnitude smaller than the aging time @xmath0 . in the experiments cited above",
    ", the aging processes were observed in a different regime where the aging times @xmath0 and the decay times @xmath56 of the slow relaxation are of the same order of magnitude .    in conclusion",
    ", the collective diffusion process of particles can be interpreted as a cage - diffusion process . for short aging times , the system is ergodic .",
    "the particles reside in the cages formed by surrounding particles and escape from them after a characteristic time which is aging time dependent . as the system ages ,",
    "the escape from the cages become slower , resulting in a strong ergodicity breaking .",
    "in many systems , such as spin - glasses and concentrated colloidal supensions , the typical relaxation time is found to behave as @xmath68 with @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , in our experiments , the characteristic time of the slow relaxation process is found to grow even faster , i.e. exponentially fast with the aging time .",
    "in addition , we find that this dependence on @xmath0 results in a non - trivial relation between the viscosity and the relaxation time .",
