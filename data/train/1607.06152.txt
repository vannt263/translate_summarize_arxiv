    "w ursae majoris ( w uma ) variables are low - mass , so - called `` overcontact '' binary systems , where the roche lobes of both stellar components are filled .",
    "w umas share a common convective envelope .",
    "both components are characterized by rapid rotation , with periods ranging from @xmath5 d to @xmath6 d. it is straightforward to obtain complete and high - quality w uma light curves in a few nights of observing time on small to moderate - sized telescopes .",
    "since w umas are very common in both old open clusters ( ocs ) and the galactic field , they have significant potential as distance indicators .",
    "approximately 0.1% of the f- , g- , and k - type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood are w umas @xcite , while in ocs their frequency may be as high as @xmath70.4% @xcite . although the occurrence frequency of main - sequence contact binaries in old globular clusters is low , the frequency of `` blue straggler''-type contact binary systems is two to three times higher there than that in ocs @xcite .",
    "w umas can reveal the evolutionary history of their host cluster , since they are thought to result from dynamical interactions in the cluster .",
    "alternatively , these systems may represent a possible final evolutionary phase of primordial binary systems , once these binaries have lost most of their angular momentum .",
    "since w umas are more than 4 mag fainter than cepheids or rr lyrae variables , studies of w uma distances have only been undertaken for just a few decades .",
    "@xcite used w umas as distance tracers for 400 objects from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) variable - star catalog .",
    "if a reliable ( orbital ) period  luminosity ( pl ) relation can be established for w uma systems , they could potentially play a similarly important role as cepheids in measuring the distances to old structures in the milky way , including those traced by old ocs and the galactic bulge .",
    "although distances based on individual w umas are not as accurate as those resulting from cepheid analysis , their large numbers could potentially overcome this disadvantage .",
    "clusters represent good stellar samples to study distances , because their distances can be estimated in a number of independent ways ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our modern understanding",
    ", these systems are most likely formed through either nuclear evolution of the most massive component in the detached phase ( a subtype ) or angular - momentum evolution of the two component stars within a convective envelope ( w subtype ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided a method to calculate the typical evolution timescales of w uma systems .",
    "armed with accurate distances , significantly improved physical parameters ( such as masses and luminosities ) can be determined . in turn ,",
    "such w uma systems can then be used to constrain the evolution of w uma systems in general .",
    "ngc 188 is an old oc at a distance of @xmath72 kpc .",
    "it contains a large number of w uma variables .",
    "seven w umas near its center were first found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite undertook a detailed survey covering 1 deg@xmath8 around the cluster center and found 16 w umas .",
    "@xcite calculated light - curve solutions for five central w umas using the wilson ",
    "devinney ( w  d ) code and discussed the w uma distance in relation to the cluster distance .",
    "@xcite obtained orbital solutions for eq cep , er cep , and v371 cep , while @xcite published similar results for three additional w umas , i.e , ep cep , es cep , and v369 cep .    in this paper , we study all eight previously identified ngc 188 w umas based on high - cadence observations obtained over a continuous period of more than two months , resulting in accurate , self - consistent , and homogeneous magnitudes and a well - determined average distance , relying on up to 3000 data points for a single w uma system .",
    "we also establish a physical relationship between these eight variables and their host cluster , ngc 188 , based on proper motions , radial velocities , and features in the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "although cepheid variables are among the most useful objects to establish the distance ladder , the small number of cepheids in our galaxy introduces relatively large statistical errors , while their disparate distances introduce comparably large systematic errors in distance modulus , reddening @xcite , and metallicity @xcite . compared with bright o- and b - type cepheids ,",
    "faint w uma dwarfs are much more plentiful .",
    "our aim is to obtain more accurate cluster distances than available to date based on our new w uma observations and , consequently , improve the corresponding pl relation . at the same time ,",
    "an important secondary goal is to obtain significantly improved w uma stellar parameters , thus allowing us to better constrain the evolution of our cluster w uma systems as a population .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss our observations and the calibration of both the ngc 188 data and the w uma properties used in this study .",
    "the light - curve results , as well as the results from cmd fitting , proper - motion , and radial - velocity selection , and our distance analysis , are covered in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the properties of our eight sample w umas , as well as the feasibility of using w umas as distance indicators , e.g. , based on their period  luminosity  color ( plc ) or pl relations , in section 4 . in section 5 , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we observed the oc ngc 188 for a total of 36 nights during two separate periods2014 september 28 to 2014 october 7 , and 2016 january 13 to 2016 march 10using the 50 cm binocular network telescope ( 50bin ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the qinghai station of purple mountain observatory ( chinese academy of sciences ) .",
    "the time - series light - curve observations in the johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands were obtained simultaneously using two andor 2k@xmath92k ccds .",
    "the telescope s field of view is @xmath10 arcmin@xmath8 , which is adequate for covering the central region of ngc 188 .",
    "details of the observations are included in table [ t1.tab ] .",
    "preliminary processing ( bias and dark - frame subtraction , as well as flat - field corrections ) of the ccd frames was performed with the standard ccdproc tasks in iraf .",
    "point - spread - function photometry was extracted using the daophot ii package .",
    "based on a comparison with the ngc 188 @xmath11 photometric catalog of @xcite , we calibrated the stellar fluxes and atmospheric absorption for a data set spanning 7 days ( 2014 october 17 ) .",
    "the transfer function is given by @xmath12 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the instrumental magnitudes , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the calibrated magnitudes .",

    ".[t1.tab ] observation log [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "observations of the old oc ngc 188 were obtained with the recently commissioned 50bin telescope in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we collected 36 nights of time - series data , spanning an unprecedented total of 3000 frames for each star . to select genuine cluster members , we performed a detailed radial - velocity and proper - motion analysis .",
    "the radial velocity of ngc 188 is @xmath16 km s@xmath17 , while its proper motion is ( @xmath18 ) = ( @xmath19 ) mas yr@xmath17 . of our total sample of 914 stars ,",
    "532 stars are probable cluster members .",
    "they delineate an obvious cluster sequence down to @xmath20 mag .",
    "we use the dartmouth stellar evolutionary isochrones @xcite to match the cluster members , adopting an age of 6 gyr and solar metallicity .",
    "a distance modulus and reddening of , respectively , @xmath2 mag and @xmath3 mag were obtained .",
    "accurate light - curve solutions were obtained for the eight w umas , and parameters such as their mass ratios and the components relative radii were estimated .",
    "we subsequently estimated the distance moduli for the w umas , independent of the cluster distance .",
    "w umas can be used to derive distance moduli with an accuracy of often significantly better than 0.2 mag .",
    "( v371 cep ) is not a genuine w uma system .",
    "@xmath22 ( er cep ) was excluded from the distance - modulus analysis because of its low cluster - membership probability . for the remaining six oc w umas ",
    "ep cep , eq cep , es cep , v369 cep , v370 cep , and v782 cep  we obtained a joint best - fitting distance modulus of @xmath23 mag , which is comparable to the result from our isochrone fits , as well as with previous results from the literature .",
    "the resulting accuracy is better than that resulting from application of the previously established empirical parametric approximation .",
    "to double check our results for ngc 188 and the applicability of w umas as distance tracer , we applied it to the oc berkeley 39 .",
    "based on four of its w umas , we derived a distance modulus of @xmath24 mag , which is also in accordance with literature results .",
    "w umas as distance tracers have significant advantages for poorly studied clusters .",
    "the six w umas in ngc 188 satisfy a tight pl relation .",
    "armed with the latter , w umas could indeed play an important role in measuring distances and to map galactic structures on more ambitious scales than done to date .    based on better distances and photometry , more accurate physical parameters for eight w uma systems",
    "were derived . using the evolutionary w uma model of @xcite ,",
    "the initial masses of seven w uma systems were estimated .",
    "all seven w uma systems have initial primary masses below 1.8 @xmath25 , which means that they have evolved along the evolutionar w - type route ( i.e. , through angular - momentum evolution within a convective envelope ) .",
    "the ages of seven sample w uma systems were estimated based on their initial masses and the current luminosity - based masses of the secondary components .",
    "six of our cluster w uma systems have similar ages as the host cluster itself , which provides confirmation of the age - dating method of @xcite .",
