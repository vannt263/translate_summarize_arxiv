    "the cheeger problem is an isoperimetric - like problem , which has been extensively studied in the last decades in different contexts , ranging from riemannian geometry to calculus of variations , also because of its connections with eigenvalue problems .",
    "its formulation is very simple : given a domain @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , one is asked to compute or estimate its _ cheeger constant _ , defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote respectively the volume and perimeter of a borel set @xmath5 . despite this so simple formulation , many non - trivial questions arise , and they are object of deep investigation .",
    "for quite a large class of domains @xmath6 , it is possible to say that the above infimum is actually a minimum , and in this case each set @xmath7 realizing the minimum is called a _ cheeger set in @xmath6 _ ; if the whole set @xmath6 is a minimizer , then it is simply called a _",
    "cheeger set _ ; it is clear that any set @xmath7 which is a cheeger set for some domain @xmath8 , is also a cheeger set .",
    "one usually refers to the `` cheeger problem '' both for the computation , or the estimation , of the constant @xmath9 , and for the characterization of cheeger sets in @xmath6 .    among various geometric properties , that will be discussed in more detail later",
    ", a particularly useful one is that the free boundary of any cheeger set @xmath7 in @xmath6 , that is , the part of @xmath10 which is in the interior of @xmath6 , is the union of a singular set of hausdorff dimension at most @xmath11 and a smooth hypersurface with constant mean curvature , and this curvature coincides with the inverse of the constant @xmath9 .",
    "this is particularly useful in the two - dimensional case , because then one deduces that @xmath12 is made by arcs of circle of radius @xmath13 , which is a very strong geometric constraint .",
    "another very important case is the one of convex domains .",
    "in particular , for a convex @xmath14-dimensional domain @xmath6 , it is known that a cheeger set @xmath7 exists , is unique , and it coincides with the union of all balls of radius @xmath13 which are contained in @xmath6 , thus @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the set of all points of @xmath6 having distance at least @xmath18 from @xmath19 ; moreover , the _ inner cheeger formula _",
    "@xmath20 for the area of @xmath17 holds .",
    "all these properties are extremely useful , in particular the `` union of balls property '' completely characterizes the cheeger set once the cheeger constant is known , and on the other hand the inner cheeger formula allows to explicitly compute @xmath18 , thus @xmath9 , because when @xmath18 increases the set @xmath17 become smaller and smaller , thus there is a unique @xmath18 such that the inner cheeger formula holds .",
    "the interested reader can look for instance  @xcite , where further applications , developments and extensions of the cheeger problem are considered ( see also the survey paper @xcite ) .    in this paper we will mainly deal with the case of strips , which are basically bended rectangles , that is , curved two - dimensional tubes .",
    "the strips , or their three - dimensional counterpart , namely , the waveguides , are quite studied since several years , in particular they are crucial in applications , for instance in engineering and in medicine for their optical properties .",
    "understanding the spectral properties of waveguides or strips is very important , and as said above this is deeply connected with the cheeger problem . particularly relevant is the limit case when strips or waveguides become extremely thin ; up to a rescaling , it is equivalent but notationally simpler to assume that the thickness is fixed and the length explodes . some more information on waveguides and their importance can be found in  @xcite and in the references therein , while the mathematical study of the cheeger problem for strips has been also carried on in  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to observe that strips behave like convex domains , even if they are not convex ; in other words , this shows that bending a rectangle to transform it into a strip does not change too much the situation for what concerns the cheeger problem .",
    "more precisely , we will show that all the properties listed above and valid for convex sets , are actually valid also for strips ; as a consequence , we derive an estimate from above and below for the cheeger constant of a strip , which is stronger than the analogous estimate found in  @xcite .",
    "we will present also several examples , some of which new , to underline that the above - mentioned properties are not valid for generic sets , but they are really specific for convex sets and for strips .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ section :",
    "basic ] we briefly recall the definition of perimeter and its main properties , then we set the cheeger problem and we list some of the main results : these are well - known , with the exception of proposition [ prop : cheegergenprop ] ( vii ) ( a weak form of a well - known `` tangential contact property '' of cheeger sets ) and of theorem [ teo : hcontinua ] ( two continuity properties of the cheeger constant with respect to @xmath21 and bv - strict topologies ) , and mostly focused on the convex two - dimensional case .",
    "then we show a technical but useful result about `` rolling balls '' , lemma  [ lemma : movingball ] .",
    "section  [ section : strip ] is the main section of the paper : here we give the definition of the strips and we prove all results concerning them .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect : examples ] we collect several examples , some well - known and other original ( and possibly interesting in themselves ) , in order to stress the peculiarity of convex domains , as well as of strips , with respect to the cheeger problem .",
    "this section is devoted to present some important facts about the cheeger problem .",
    "after a first , very brief introduction on the concept of perimeter , we will start , in section  [ sectdef ] , with the relevant definitions and the most important , general properties of the cheeger problem ( in addition to the well - known ones , we prove two facts , namely proposition [ prop : cheegergenprop ] ( vii ) and theorem [ teo : hcontinua ] , that we have not been able to locate in the existing literature ) .",
    "then , in section  [ sectconv ] , we will discuss some known facts concerning the convex case , and finally , in section  [ sectnew ] , we will give a couple of technical results valid in the planar case : even though they seem quite intuitive , we could not find them written anywhere .",
    "let us start with a very quick introductory section about the notion of perimeter .",
    "the initiated reader can clearly skip it , but also any other reader can do the same , and limit himself to read this paper considering the case of sufficiently regular sets , where the notion of perimeter is well - known .    given any borel set @xmath22 , we will denote by @xmath23 its lebesgue measure ( which we will also shortly call _ volume _ ) , and by @xmath24 its _",
    "perimeter_. while for a sufficiently smooth set , for instance a set with lipschitz boundary , or a polyhedron , the standard concept of perimeter is simply the @xmath25-area of the boundary , in the general framework of borel sets this does nt work properly .",
    "the correct , general definition of perimeter of a borel set @xmath26 is then the following , @xmath27 whenever @xmath28 , we will say that @xmath7 is a _ set of finite perimeter _ ; if this is the case , it can be proved that the perimeter of @xmath7 coincides with the total variation of the distributional gradient of the characteristic function of @xmath7 , namely , @xmath29 this allows us to define also the _ relative perimeter _",
    "@xmath30 for any pair of borel sets @xmath31 ; roughly speaking , the relative perimeter @xmath32 measures how big is the boundary of @xmath7 inside @xmath33 .",
    "an immediate application of the radon - nikodym theorem yields the existence of a borel vector - valued function @xmath34 , the _ outer normal _ of @xmath7 , such that @xmath35 @xmath36-almost everywhere , and @xmath37 an important , equivalent definition of @xmath38 is the following : we define the _ reduced boundary _ @xmath39 as the set of all the points @xmath40 such that @xmath41 for all @xmath42 and the limit @xmath43 exists and has norm @xmath44 ( here , and in the following , we will always denote by @xmath45 the ball centered at @xmath46 with radius @xmath18 , and set @xmath47 ) .",
    "one can prove that this limit exists @xmath36-almost everywhere and coincides with @xmath48 for @xmath36-almost each point of @xmath49 .",
    "it is immediate to observe that , whenever @xmath7 is smooth enough , then the reduced boundary is nothing else than the usual topological boundary , and the outer normal coincides with the exterior normal vector to the boundary .",
    "however , for a general borel set the next classical result by de giorgi holds  @xcite .",
    "[ teo : degiorgi ] let @xmath7 be a set of finite perimeter , then    * @xmath39 is countably @xmath50-rectifiable in the sense of federer  @xcite ; * for any @xmath51 , @xmath52 in @xmath53 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the half - space through @xmath56 whose exterior normal is @xmath57 ; * for any borel set @xmath33 , @xmath58 , thus in particular @xmath59 ; * @xmath60 for any @xmath61 .",
    "as we noticed above , these notions extend perfectly the classical notions whenever a set is smooth enough .",
    "in particular , for a regular set one has @xmath62 ; for a general borel set it is always true , by the theorem above , that @xmath59 , but this does not need to coincide with the @xmath63 measure of the topological boundary .",
    "there are many advantages of using this generalized notion of perimeter .",
    "first of all , this applies to any borel set ; moreover , whenever two sets coincide almost everywhere , then their reduced boundaries and so , their perimeters coincide ( while the topological boundaries can be completely different ) .",
    "another important feature is the validity of the following well - known lower - semicontinuity and compactness properties ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :    [ prop : semicomp ] let @xmath64 be an open set and let @xmath65 be a sequence of borel sets .",
    "we have the following well - known properties :    * if @xmath7 is a borel set , such that @xmath66 in @xmath67 , then @xmath68 ; * if there exists a constant @xmath69 such that @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , then there exists a subsequence @xmath72 and a borel set @xmath7 such that @xmath73 in @xmath67 .",
    "other useful properties of the perimeter ( invariance by isometries and scaling property , isoperimetric inequality , lattice property ) are collected in the next proposition .    given two borel sets @xmath74 of finite perimeter , @xmath75 and an isometry @xmath76 , we have @xmath77   \\label{isoprn } p(e ) \\geq n{\\omega}_{n}^{1/n}|e|^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}\\,,\\\\[3pt ] \\label{reticolo } p(e\\cup f ) + p(e\\cap f ) \\leq p(e ) + p(f)\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    while generic sets of finite perimeter can be also very weird , a regularity theory is available in particular for _ minimizers _ of the perimeter subject to a volume constraint ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "we introduce the cheeger problem and we list some well - known results .",
    "the definition of the problem is the following : for any bounded , open set @xmath6 , we define the _ cheeger constant of @xmath78 _ as @xmath86 any set @xmath87 which realizes the above infimum is called a _",

    "the proofs of ( iii ) and ( iv ) are accomplished by , respectively , proposition  [ prop : semicomp ] and theorem  [ teo : regolarita ] .",
    "the proof of  ( v ) follows from the isoperimetric inequality   and the fact that @xmath105 .",
    "finally , to prove ( vi ) it is enough to apply   and get @xmath106 hence all previous inequalities are actually equalities and this readily proves ( vi ) . instead , concerning the property  ( vii )",
    ", it is widely known if the boundary of @xmath6 is smooth in a neighborhood of @xmath46 ( see for instance  @xcite ) but , as far as we know , it has not yet been written in the fully general form as above .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we add in the appendix a proof of it .",
    "we notice that , by proposition  [ prop : cheegergenprop ] ( iii ) , ( v ) and ( vi ) , we can always find minimal cheeger sets in @xmath78 ( possibly not unique ) and a unique maximal cheeger set ( this last can be obtained as the union of all minimal cheeger sets of @xmath78 ) .",
    "an example of a domain with two disjoint minimal cheeger sets is shown in figure  [ fig : duecheeger ] .",

    "the study of the behaviour of the strips in the cheeger problem has been already started in  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "in particular , an interesting feature of the cheeger problem for strips is that some of the properties which are valid in the convex case ( recall the discussion of section  [ sectconv ] ) are still valid for the strips , which are not convex .",

    "we split the proof in three steps .",
    "it is immediate to observe that , if a set has a concave corner , then a small cut around it ( of size @xmath176 ) decreases the perimeter of order @xmath176 , and the area only of order @xmath301 , hence for @xmath176 small enough the cheeger ratio is decreased .",
    "this simple remark ensures that a cheeger set can never contain a concave corner , thus in particular a set with concave corners can not be cheeger in itself . in particular , having four @xmath302-degrees corners , a strip is never cheeger in itself ( and since a strip is connected , this implies that @xmath303 is not empty ) .",

    "let @xmath298 be a connected component of @xmath295 , let @xmath305 its two endpoints , and call @xmath306 the ball whose boundary contains @xmath298 . in this step",
    "we are going to show that one of the two points @xmath307 and @xmath308 belongs to a lateral side ( that is , @xmath269 or @xmath270 ) , and the other point belongs either to the `` upper side '' or to the `` lower side '' that is , @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "to prove this claim , we have to exclude the following possibilities .",

    ", we divide the proof in some steps .",
    "let us start by defining the functions @xmath390 .",
    "first of all , lemma  [ lemma1.1 ] ensures the existence of arcs of circle contained in @xmath391 , each one associated with a corner of @xmath241 in the sense of step  ii of the proof of lemma  [ lemma1.1 ] .",
    "as we already pointed out in that proof , each of the four corners of @xmath241 must be ruled out of @xmath7 , and this means that there are at least four arcs in @xmath303 .",
    "we want to show that they are actually exactly four , or in other words that the four corners of @xmath241 are in a one - to - one correspondence with the connected components of @xmath303 .",
    "to do so , let @xmath298 be such an arc , and let @xmath45 be the ball which contains @xmath298 as a part of its boundary : by step  ii of the proof of lemma  [ lemma1.1 ] , we know that exactly one endpoint of @xmath298 belongs either to the upper side @xmath371 or to the lower side @xmath372 . if an endpoint of @xmath298 belongs to @xmath371 , then we know that the center @xmath46 of @xmath45 must be @xmath392 for some @xmath393 ; conversely , if an endpoint of @xmath298 belongs to @xmath372 , then @xmath394 for some @xmath393 .",
    "however , step  i of the proof of lemma  [ lemma1.2 ] implies that there is exactly a single @xmath46 of the form @xmath392 such that the ball @xmath45 is tangent to @xmath269 , and exactly another one such that the ball is tangent to @xmath270 .",
    "this ensures that there is exactly a single arc ruling out each of the four corners of @xmath241 .    as a consequence ,",
    "we know that @xmath303 is made by four arcs of circle @xmath395 , @xmath396 , @xmath397 and @xmath398 , connecting respectively the left side with the upper side , the upper with the right , the right with the bottom , and the bottom with the left . therefore , @xmath10 is the union of these four arcs , plus two segments @xmath399 and @xmath400 respectively in @xmath269 and @xmath270 , plus two curves @xmath401 and @xmath402 respectively in @xmath371 and @xmath372 .",

    "indeed , otherwise there should be a segment @xmath236 which intersects twice one of the four arcs , say @xmath395 , and then by continuity there should be another segment @xmath316 which is tangent to the arc @xmath395 : this is impossible , because then the whold segment @xmath316 would be in the upper - left connected component of @xmath409 , and this is absurd because @xmath410 can not be in that component .",
    "it readily follows that the functions @xmath390 are continuous , and that they fulfill the property  ( [ intergrafico ] ) ; the fact that @xmath7 is simply connected is then immediate .",
    "moreover , the construction ensures that the four arcs @xmath411 only depend on @xmath241 , not on @xmath7 , and thus there is actually a unique cheeger set .",
    "let us now call @xmath412 the union of all balls of radius @xmath18 contained in @xmath241 , and let us show that @xmath413 .",
    "first of all , let @xmath306 be any ball of radius @xmath18 contained in @xmath7 ( we know that such a ball exists , for instance any of the balls containing one of the four arcs @xmath411 have this property by lemma [ lemma1.1 ] ) .",
    "then let @xmath414 be any other ball , still of radius @xmath18 , contained in @xmath241 .",
