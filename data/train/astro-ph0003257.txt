    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , electromagnetically the most luminous events in the universe , are short and intense flashes of cosmic high energy ( @xmath2 100 kev@xmath161 mev ) photons .",
    "the emission from grb afterglows , though similar in nature to the emission from supernovae , is more energetic by a few orders of magnitudes , as they release @xmath17 ergs or more in a few seconds .",
    "following the naming sequence , nova and supernova , it is therefore appropriate to call grbs as hypernova .",
    "the origin of grbs is a mystery even after about 30 years of their accidental discovery by the vela satellites .",
    "interest focused on where they came from and what they were , but was hampered by lack of sufficient data to even locate them",
    ". a major break through in our understanding of grbs has been achieved in recent years ( cf .",

    "1999a and references therein ) mostly due to multi - wavelength observations of the long - lived emission , known as afterglow of grb , at @xmath18ray , optical and radio wavelengths which have become routine after launch of the italian - dutch @xmath18ray satellite bepposax in mid-1996 , as it provides the positions of grbs with an accuracy better than 3@xmath165 arc minutes within hours of occurrence .",
    "they indicate that most likely all grbs are at cosmological distances .",
    "the fireball plus blast wave is the most accepted current theoretical model for grbs and their afterglows ( see piran 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the grbs are thought to arise when a massive explosion , known as a fireball , releases a large ( @xmath19 ) amount of kinetic energy into a volume of less than 1 light ms across . when this ultra - relativistic outflow of particles interacts with surrounding material , both forward and reverse shocks",
    "are formed .",
    "the grb itself is thought to owe its multi - peaked light curve to a series of internal shocks within a relativistic flow while the afterglows are due to the external ( forward ) shocks driven in the interstellar medium surrounding the burster . as the external shock interacts with increasing amount of swept - up material",
    ", it becomes less relativistic , and produces a slowly fading afterglow of @xmath18ray , then ultra - violet , optical , infrared , millimeter and radio radiation .",
    "the afterglow emissions are most likely synchrotron radiation ( sari et al . 1998 ; piran 1999 and references therein ) . compared to the duration of the grbs , afterglows in the long - wavelength bands can be long - lived .",
    "this makes now a days international multi - wavelength observing campaigns as integral part of a grb research .",
    "the optical transient ( ot ) of a grb has generally apparent @xmath0 magnitude between 18 to 22 , if it is detected a few hours after the burst .",
    "the 1-m class optical telescopes equipped with ccd detector are therefore capable of detecting the optical early afterglow of a grb . as the optical follow - up",
    "observations of the grb afterglows are valuable for understanding the nature of these bursts , we started such observations at u.p",

    "the large energy release can also not be understood with exotic models such as that of baryon decay ( perna & loeb 1998 ) , as the entire or a good fraction of rest mass energy of neutron stars is released in such models .",
    "there are two ways namely gravitational lensing and non - isotropic emission to reduce the enormous energy release .",
    "the possibility of the burst being amplified by gravitational lensing has been discussed at length by kulkarni et al .",

    "evidence for beaming seems to be present in the case of a few grbs including grb 991208 discussed below .",
    "indeed , almost all energetic sources in astrophysics such as pulsars , quasars and accreting stellar black holes display jet - like geometry and hence , non - isotropic emission .",
    "beaming reduces the estimated energy by a factor of 10 - 300 , depending upon the size of its opening angle ( sari et al .",
    "the @xmath3ray energy released then becomes @xmath101 erg , a value within reach of current popular models for the origin of grbs ( see piran 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "using optical and near - ir observations ( see table 1 ) , we obtained the values of flux decay constant and spectral index as 2.2@xmath360.1 and @xmath102 for grb 991208 ot and 1.2@xmath360.1 and @xmath103 for the early time flux decay of grb 991216 afterglows .",

    "any conclusion from the flux decays of these grbs , we compare them with other well studied grbs . except grb 990123 and grb 990510 , all exhibit , at both early and late times a single power - law decay , generally @xmath2 1.2 , a value reasonable for spherical expansion in the standard model .",

    "1999 ) and grb 991208 with @xmath50 = 2.2@xmath360.1 and @xmath108 ( discussed here ) , can not be understood in terms of standard models but can either be explained by a jet ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ) or by a circumstellar wind model ( chevalier & li 1999 ) .",
    "recent theoretical models on beaming of the relativistic outflow predict a break and a marked steepening in the afterglow light curve ( mszros & rees 1999 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "in such models , a break in the light curve is expected when the jet makes the transition to sideways expansion after the relativistic lorentz factor drops below the inverse of the opening angle of the initial beam . slightly later",
    ", the jet begins a lateral expansion which causes a further steepening of the light curve .",
    "the time of occurrence of break and extent of steepening in the afterglow light curve thus depend upon the opening angle of the transient collimated outflow . at late times , when the evolution is dominated by the spreading of the jet , the value of @xmath50 is expected to approach the electron energy distribution index with values between 2.0 and 2.5 while the value of @xmath71 is expected to be @xmath109 , if cooling frequency has passed the observed frequency and @xmath110 otherwise ( sari et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the expected values of @xmath50 and @xmath71 are thus in excellent agreement with the corresponding observed values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 for grb 990510 ( stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) and 2.2@xmath360.1 and @xmath102 for grb 991208 ( discussed here ) .",
    "fast optical flux decay and flat broadband spectrum observed in grb 991208 here may therefore be due to effects of beaming like in grb 990510 .",
    "observational evidence for a break was found first in the optical light curve of grb 990123 afterglow ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999a ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ) and recently in that of grb 990510 afterglow ( stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) , where the light curve steepened 1.5 to 2 days after the burst .",
    "the value of @xmath113 for early time ( 3 hr to 2 day ) of the grb 990123 light curve becomes 1.75@xmath360.11 at late times ( 2 - 20 day ) while the corresponding slopes for grb 990510 are 0.76@xmath360.01 and 2.40@xmath360.02 respectively with the break time 1.57@xmath360.03 day .",
    "if the steepening observed in both cases are due to beaming , then one may conclude that it occures within @xmath60 2 days of the burst .",
    "we therefore argue that observed steep decay in the optical light curve of grb 991208 afterglow may be due to beaming which occurred before the start of its optical observations which is @xmath2 2.1 day after the burst .",
    "however , a break in the light curve of grb afterglow can occur due to a number of causes other than beaming ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; wei & lu 1999 ) .",
    "we are presently unable to understand the possible cause of steepening by 0.23@xmath360.06 in the @xmath0 light curve of grb 991216 between 2 to 2.5 day after the burst , as beaming steepens the light curve by @xmath2 1 dex .",
    "prompt @xmath3ray emission light curves of both long duration bursts grb 991208 and grb 991216 show complicated and irregular time profile .",
    "presence of multi - peaked and spiky temporal profile in the light curves of both grbs is an unambiguous indicator of a series of internal shocks within a relativistic flow .",
    "redshift determinations yield a minimum distance of 4.2 gpc for grb 991208 and 6.2 gpc for the grb 991216 , if one assumes standard friedmann cosmology with @xmath114 km / s / mpc , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "both grbs are thus at cosmological distances . considering isotropic energy emission , we estimate enormous amount of the @xmath3ray energy release ( @xmath94 erg for grb 991208 and @xmath117 erg for grb 991216 ) .",
    "these high energetics are reduced if the emission is not isotropic but collimated , as suggested by the flat spectrum and steep decay in the optical light curve of grb 991208 .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous spectral energy distributions are determined for both grb afterglows in optical and near - ir region .",
    "the flux decreases with frequency in both cases and follows an exponential relation with not too different spectral slopes .",
