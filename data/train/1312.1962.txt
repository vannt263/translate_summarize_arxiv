    "time - resolved pump - probe optical spectroscopy represents a new powerful tool to study materials with strongly correlated electrons and offers a direct approach to far - from - equilibrium phenomena , probing in particular the relaxation and thermalization processes @xcite .",
    "it appears that strongly correlated systems are in general characterized very fast relaxation processes , emerging from the inherent strong interactions .",

    "the transient nonequilibrium state with a weak electromagnetic pulse naturally leads to the linear - response approach .",
    "the optical conductivity @xmath0 is the time - dependent dynamical quantity directly relevant to pump - probe optical spectroscopy and represents the response to the probing electric field in a nonequilibrium situation .",

    "there are also studies in which the effect of the probe field after the intensive pulse excitation is directly followed by introduction of the ( classical ) driving time - dependent electric field @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce the differential optical conductivity @xmath0 representing the causal linear response of the lattice current to an arbitrary electric - field pulse @xmath3 , acting on a general nonequilibrium many - body wave function @xmath4 within a tight - binding model of correlated electrons .",
    "such a formulation allows the definition and the consideration of the optical sum rule at any time , as well as the possible existence of the drude weight @xmath5 as the dissipationless response .    as a nontrivial example we test the formalism by numerical investigation of a single highly excited charged particle ( hole ) within mott - hubbard insulator , as represented by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
