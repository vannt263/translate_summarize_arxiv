    "the interaction of a single quantized mode of electromagnetic radiation ( photons ) with a two - state system , such as a nuclear spin or two - level atom , can be modeled by means of the rabi hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "although simple and physically transparent in its formulation , the rabi hamiltonian does not offer a known exact eigenstate , due to the ` counter - rotating ' interaction terms in the hamiltonian . in the resonance regime however , these fast - frequency counter - rotating terms average out with respect to the collective two - level oscillations , and can be neglected in first - order perturbation ( the so - called rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) ) .",
    "this gives rise to the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "due to the rwa , the jc hamiltonian exhibits an additional symmetry , which allows for the decomposition of the hilbert space into irreducible representations ( irreps ) conserving the total number of ( bosonic and atomic ) excitations . for the two - level ( @xmath1 quasispin ) formulation of the jc model ,",
    "these irreps remain two - dimensional and therefore reduce to two - level mixing models .",
    "one of the successes of theoretical and experimental quantum mechanics is that such simple theoretical models have been validated in sophisticated experiments situated in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , circuit quantum electrodynamics @xcite , etc .",
    "a direct consequence of the additional symmetry is that the two - level jc model exhibits two linearly independent conserved operators , _",
    "i.e. _  the hamiltonian and the operator counting the total number of excitations .",
    "as the model has two degrees of freedom ( the electromagnetic photon mode and the two - level system ) , the model is _ integrable _ by definition @xcite , and supports a bethe ansatz product wavefunction @xcite .",
    "this result can be generalized to general @xmath2-level systems , also referred to as tavis - cummings models @xcite , or a collections of inequivalent @xmath2-level systems interacting via a single mediating bosonic mode , called the dicke model @xcite .",
    "the integrability of the dicke model has been established first by gaudin @xcite , by means of an infinite dimensional schwinger representation of the central spin in the gaudin magnet .",
    "later , the full set of conserved charges of the dicke model has been derived by dukelsky et .",
    "@xcite , by mapping one of the @xmath0 quasispin copies of the richardson - gaudin conserved charges onto the bosonic mode @xcite . as a bethe ansatz integrable model ,",
    "the conserved charges and bethe ansatz state of the dicke model can also be obtained from the algebraic bethe ansatz method @xcite , however a direct and simplified derivation of the bethe - ansatz state with the corresponding bethe equations solution is feasible using a commutator scheme @xcite .    for the derivation of the conserved charges of the dicke model from those of the richardson - gaudin model @xcite , a contraction of one of the quasispin algebras in the model was required .",
    "this contraction maps the @xmath0 quasispin directly onto a bosonic heisenberg - weyl algebra @xmath3 .",
    "recently , it has been shown how the bethe ansatz states in the richardson - gaudin ( rg ) solution @xcite of the reduced bardeen - cooper - schriefer ( bcs ) hamiltonian for conventional superconductivity @xcite can be connected adiabatically to a product state of generalized bosons @xcite employing a pseudo deformation of the quasispin algebra .",
    "the product structure of the bethe ansatz state is reminiscent of the projected bcs approximation , in which the superconducting state is approximated by a condensate of collective cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "however , in general the rg variables ( or rapidities ) parametrizing the generalized quasispin creation operators in the bethe ansatz state differ from each other , which is not reconcilable with the concept of a true condensate .",
    "the pseudo deformation maps the hard - core bosonic @xmath0 quasispin algebra of the bcs pairing hamiltonian into a genuinely bosonic @xmath3 by means of a continuous pseudo - deformation parameter .",
    "the reduced bcs hamiltonian remains integrable along the path of deformation , allowing for an adiabatic and injective mapping of the exact bethe ansatz states into a condensate of ( orthogonal ) bosonic modes @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the coupled set of rg equations of integrability reduce to a single decoupled equation , equivalent to the secular equation of the particle - particle tamm - dancoff approximation ( @xmath4-tda ) for the elementary pairing modes for the reduced bcs hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "reversely , the pseudo deformation enables one to numerically reconstruct the solution of the coupled set of non - linear rg equations from the simpler decoupled secular @xmath4-tda equation , by adiabatically reintroducing the pauli principle in the integrable model @xcite .    in the present manuscript",
    ", we will reassess the derivation of the conserved charges of the dicke from those of the richardson - gaudin ( rg ) models in the framework of the pseudo - deformed quasispin algebra .",
    "this will enable an adiabatic connection of the dicke model with the @xmath0 based richardson - gaudin models .",
    "the connection can be made consistently on the level of the hamiltonian , the conserved charges , the bethe ansatz state , as well as the bethe ( or richardson - gaudin ) equations , and sheds light on how the dicke model can be embedded within the larger class of richardson - gaudin integrable models .",

    "these eigenstates are given by means of the bethe ansatz @xmath16 the number of excitations , and @xmath17 the tensor product of the lowest - weight irreps of each @xmath9 copy .",
    "the notation @xmath18 signifies that the @xmath8-dimensional matrix @xmath12 has been extended to an @xmath19-dimensional matrix which still obeys the gaudin algebra ( [ rg : gaudinalgebra ] ) and the antisymmetry condition . for state (",
    "[ rg : betheansatz ] ) to be an eigenstate of the conserved charges ( [ rg : conservedcharges ] ) , the extended @xmath13 ( and @xmath12 ) matrices need to satisfy the following bethe ansatz equations @xmath20 up to this point , the gaudin algebra has not been specified , so these results are fully independent of the particular realisation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there are several parametrizations existing in the literature @xcite , which can be classified according to the following copy - independent relation @xmath21 with @xmath22 a constant for all @xmath23 .",
    "the widely used @xmath24 parametrization gives rise to the rational model , whereas the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are known as the trigonometric and hyperbolic models respectively ] . in the present manuscript",
    ", we will mainly focus on the trigonometric case , which can be parametrized in terms of a set of @xmath8 real variables @xmath27 @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but equivalent parametrizations exist @xcite .",
    "the pseudo deformed quasispin algebra @xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath30=s^\\dag(\\xi),\\quad[s^0(\\xi),s(\\xi)]=-s(\\xi),\\quad[s^\\dag(\\xi),s(\\xi)]=2\\xi s^0(\\xi ) + ( \\xi-1)\\case{1}{2}\\omega\\ ] ] with @xmath31 the pseudo - deformation parameter and @xmath32 the dimension ( or degeneracy ) of the original quasispin irrep ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it can be easily verified that the limits @xmath33 and @xmath34 give rise to the original @xmath0 algebra and a ( unnormalised ) bosonic @xmath3 algebra respectively . the nomenclature _ pseudo _",
    "deformation is chosen because this algebra can be reduced to a canonical @xmath0 algebra @xmath35=a^\\dag(\\xi),\\qquad[a^0(\\xi),a(\\xi)]=-a(\\xi),\\qquad[a^\\dag(\\xi),a(\\xi)]=2a^0(\\xi),\\ ] ] with @xmath36 except for the @xmath34 limit .",

    "the physical interpretation of this is that the effective degeneracy of the quasispin algebra is gradually increased with decreasing @xmath31 , reaching infinity for the full @xmath34 contraction limit .",
    "it should be noted that only discrete values of @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) give rise to unitary irreps .",
    "nevertheless , this is not an obstacle because the theory of rg integrability does not depend on matrix representations ( with integer dimensions ) , and the parameter @xmath31 can be regarded as a continuous variable .",
    "this is illustrated by the following construction . because the set of generators @xmath39 span an @xmath0 algebra , the following set of conserved charges are equally in involution @xmath43,\\ ] ] provided the matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 fulfill the gaudin algebra ( [ rg : gaudinalgebra ] ) .",

    "the rg equations are solved in the tractable full contraction limit ( [ pseudodeformation : rgequations : contractionlimit ] ) , and are then adiabatically brought into the original form ( [ rg : rgequations ] ) by tuning @xmath55 .",
    "the pseudo - deformation in the previous section was used to transform all @xmath9 copies ( @xmath56 $ ] ) in the system into a bosonic @xmath57 . because the jc and dicke models contain only one bosonic mode",
    ", it would be interesting to see whether an equivalent scheme can be used to obtain the dicke model from the @xmath58 rg systems by deforming a single quasispin copy .",
