    "the linear perturbations of the schwarzschild spacetime were first examined by regge and wheeler @xcite , who were trying to solve the stability problem of the black hole .",
    "they derived what is now called the regge - wheeler equation , a second order ordinary differential equation similar to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the perturbation radiates away at the speed of light satisfying the wave equation and hence it corresponds to the gravitational wave around the black hole . therefore to examine the perturbations of the black hole",
    "is equivalent to solving the scattering problem of gravitational waves around the black hole .",
    "their pioneering work has led to the study of the quasinormal modes because they dominates most processes involving perturbed black holes .",
    "quasinormal modes were first found by vishveshwara @xcite and by press @xcite through numerical computations of the time evolution of the gravitational waves around the black hole .",
    "external perturbations excite the quasinormal modes which in turn appear as damped vibration , emitting gravitational waves with specific frequencies .",
    "this has been shown in several other investigations on the response of the black hole to the external perturbations .",
    "there have been several algorithms proposed to determine these resonant frequencies of the black hole . the first method presented by chandrasekhar and detweiler",
    "@xcite was not sufficient to obtain accurate values of the quasinormal frequencies because their scheme , namely , a direct numerical integration of the regge - wheeler equation , was not stable , especially for rapidly damped modes .",
    "however , it is remarkable that they were able to obtain for the first time values of the first few least damped quasinormal modes",
    ".    meanwhile , there have been some attempts to obtain the frequencies analytically .",
    "an inverse potential method by mashhoon @xcite was the first attempt to obtain the quasinormal frequencies using a potential for which the spectrum is analytically solvable .",
    "there is also a semianalytic approach , the wkb method used by schutz and will @xcite , and later refined by iyer and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they have provided relatively easy and intuitively understandable schemes for obtaining the quasinormal frequencies .",
    "the methods have also been applied to the kerr @xcite and reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite and have provided numerical values for fundamental modes . however",
    ", these algorithms can not provide very accurate values for the frequencies and break down completely for rapidly damped modes .",
    "leaver @xcite has shown that a continued fraction method previously used for determining the energy spectrum of the hydrogen molecule ion @xcite can be generalized to determine the quasinormal frequencies .",
    "this method provides extremely accurate values for the frequencies of the schwarzschild and kerr black hole .",
    "it was found in the schwarzschild case that there are an infinite number of damped modes for every multipole index @xmath1 and these modes are located approximately parallel to the imaginary axis . also for the kerr black hole",
    ", he calculated how these modes move from the schwarzschild quasinormal frequencies as the black hole parameter changes .",
    "later , he generalized his method to the reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite , and found out how the quasinormal modes move as the charge of the black hole changes .",
    "these results for the non - rotating cases are confirmed by other independent investigations : nollert and schmidt @xcite presented the laplace transform method which are in excellent agreement with leaver s results for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "andersson and coworkers used the phase integral method for the schwarzschild black hole @xcite to obtain the consistent results .",
    "the last method was also used for the reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite .",
    "there are several methods to precisely obtain the quasinormal frequencies for the non - rotating cases , nevertheless , the continued fraction method by leaver is still the only known way which can be generalized to the kerr quasinormal frequencies .",
    "the kerr black hole is most important astrophysically , thus its quasinormal modes should be investigated in detail . at the same time , several questions were raised by the previous detailed studies of the quasinormal frequencies of the reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have improved a continued fraction method for the extreme case and then discovered a curious fact that the gravitational and the electromagnetic frequencies are identical .",
    "whether this is also the case for the kerr black hole is still unknown . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a detailed calculation of the quasinormal modes of charged black holes focusing on the rapidly damped modes for nearly extreme cases .",
    "we found that the rapidly damped modes show several peculiar features : the higher modes generally spiral into the value for the extreme black hole as the charge increases .",
    "we also found that there is a quasinormal mode that converges to the algebraically special mode @xcite when the charge vanishes , even though there was no correlation between these two modes in the charged case .",
    "it is still unresolved whether this is just a coincidence or can be explained physically .",
    "there are arguments for and against the existence of the quasinormal modes on the imaginary axis .",
    "some methods indicate that there should be such a mode and that it corresponds to the ninth quasinormal mode .",
    "the problem is that the algebraically special mode of non - rotating black holes is purely imaginary and that most existing methods do not work for purely imaginary modes . in order to resolve this arguments",
    ", it will be useful to investigate the kerr case because the algebraically special mode move away from the imaginary axis and thus can be compared with the quasinormal modes .",
    "it is also important to know in detail the behavior of quasinormal modes for nearly extreme kerr black holes , because some astrophysically relevant black holes are a consequence of the coalescence of binary neutron stars and are believed to have a considerably large angular momentum .",
    "however , the behavior of these modes near the extreme limit is not yet well known .    in this paper ,",
    "the quasinormal frequencies of the kerr black hole are numerically computed using leaver s continued fraction method beyond his original calculation .",
    "several unresolved problems about the kerr quasinormal modes are discussed .",
    "it is well known that perturbations of the kerr black hole are described by the teukolsky equations . in case a @xmath2- and @xmath3- dependence is given by @xmath4 , the separated differential equation for an angular part of perturbations is @xmath5 @xmath6 and that of a radial part is @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 these equations correspond to the electromagnetic waves in the kerr geometry when @xmath10 and the gravitational waves when @xmath11 . in",
    "what follows , we normalize @xmath12 if otherwise mentioned .    in the schwarzschild case , eq.([eq : teu - ang ] ) can be solved analytically and hence the separation constant @xmath13 can be obtained as @xmath14 . however , in the kerr case , we have to solve it numerically as follows @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions for eq.([eq : teu - ang ] ) are that @xmath15 is regular at the regular singular points @xmath16 .",
    "the indices there are determined by the regularity at both singular points and are given by @xmath17 at @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20 . a solution to eq.([eq : teu - ang ] ) can be expressed as @xmath21 the expansion coefficients are related by a three - term recurrence relation and the boundary condition at @xmath18 is satisfied only by its minimal solution sequence .",
    "the recurrence relation is @xmath22 where the recurrence coefficients are , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 the minimal solution sequence will be obtained if the angular separation constant @xmath13 is a root of the continue fraction equation below , @xmath26    the boundary conditions for quasinormal modes for the radial equation are @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . thus , the solution should be @xmath30 where the expansion coefficients are again defined by a three - term recurrence relation : @xmath31 the recursion coefficients are @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined by @xmath34 the boundary condition that eq.([eq : serk ] ) converges as @xmath35 reduces again to @xmath36 the problem is now to seek frequencies which satisfy both eq.([eq : cf - r ] ) and eq.([eq : cf - a ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath37 is similar to the reissner - nordstrm quasinormal modes and hence several things will be repeated .",
    "first , each @xmath37 mode always has a corresponding mode symmetric about the imaginary axis .",
    "this is due to a symmetry of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cf - r ] ) and ( [ eq : cf - a ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that these continued fraction equations are equivalent even after the transformation of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath37 a solution always appear as a complex conjugate pair in @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast to the reissner - nordstrm black hole the mode - frequencies of the first few modes have the damping rates ( imaginary parts of @xmath42 ) which decrease monotonically as @xmath43 increases . on the other hand , the oscillation frequencies ( real parts of @xmath42 ) increase with @xmath43 , which is the same as the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "these results are clear from fig .",
    "1 , where we show the behavior of the first three modes for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the left endpoint of each line corresponds to the schwarzschild mode , and the right endpoint corresponds to the @xmath48 kerr mode .",
    "the electromagnetic modes of the reissner - nordstrm , which correspond to the @xmath10 modes here , moved very fast when the charge of the black hole is changed @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath10 kerr black hole modes move slowly even when the angular momentum of the black hole is changed .",
    "this can be understood , because the electromagnetic perturbation depends more on the change of the black hole electronic charge rather than the change of the angular momentum . even though one might expect that the gravitational and the electromagnetic mode coalesce in the extreme limit as was established in the charged black hole case @xcite , obviously there is no such correlation between these two modes in fig . 1 .",
    "the behavior for the first few modes were rather simple , but the rapidly damped modes show the same strange behavior as in the reissner - nordstrm black hole . as presented in fig .",
    "2 , the first strange feature appears for @xmath49 in the @xmath50 electromagnetic modes and for @xmath51 in the @xmath52 gravitational modes .",
    "these modes go through a couple of small loops when the angular momentum increases .",
    "similar loops are also found in the results for the higher mode number , @xmath53 . in these figures",
    "it is clear that the loops are getting bigger and the number of cycles increases when the mode number is getting higher , as in the case of the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "these strange features typically appear when the ratio of the damping rate to the oscillation frequency reaches a certain value , approximately between five and ten for any multipole index @xmath1 , which is rather large compared with the charged black hole case . since the highly damped modes are not well understood , it is difficult to explain why such a peculiar behavior occurs . in the previous paper @xcite we suggested that the fall - off rate of the effective potential at the horizon might be the cause .",
    "this explanation suggests itself also in this case , because for the kerr black hole the fall - off rate of the potential depends on the kerr parameter in a similar way as the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "it should be noted that we have tracked the trajectory of the @xmath52 ninth overtone ( @xmath0 ) gravitational quasinormal mode in fig .",
    "this frequency is known to coalesce with the algebraically special mode at the schwarzschild limit which is located on the imaginary axis .",
    "the algebraically special mode is defined in a completely different way from the quasinormal mode .",
    "it is defined as a mode that is purely ingoing at both boundaries .",
    "thus , it seems that there is no reason that these modes have any kind of relationship .",
    "we will discuss this matter in sec .",
    "[ sec : alg ] .    the numerical error in the previous work @xcite , possibly caused by the bad convergence property of the continued fraction , does not effect the kerr black hole case .",
    "the convergence of the continued fraction is very fast for the kerr black hole and thus can avoid numerical errors . when checking our code for the fundamental @xmath52 gravitational mode , it was possible to obtain the mode accurately until @xmath54 . for the reissner - nordstrm black hole",
    "the same mode could be calculated only up to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , it is concluded that although the teukolsky equations are more complicated than the zerilli - moncrief equations the quasinormal frequencies can be calculated very precisely through the continued fraction method even when the kerr parameter is near the maximum value .",
    "the recurrence relations in the reissner - nordstrm black hole are four - term recurrence relations and numerical instability might be caused through the transformation of four - term relations into three - term relations .",
    "first we discuss the case of the @xmath11 gravitational perturbation with the least multipole index @xmath52 .",
    "( the case with higher multipole index is similar . )",
    "it is noted that @xmath57 must be in a range of @xmath58 , thus we have four different modes for @xmath52 with @xmath59 . owing to the symmetry that we mentioned before ,",
    "all the modes with the azimuthal multipole index @xmath57 are obtained by reflecting the modes with the index @xmath60 about the imaginary axis .",
    "we therefore discuss only the modes in the right - half of the complex plane .",
    "the trajectories of the @xmath61 modes are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . we can find that the oscillation frequency becomes very fast when the kerr parameter is increased , on the other hand , the damping rates become slower .",
    "the mode moves fast away from the corresponding schwarzschild mode .",
    "however the branch of @xmath62 moves slowly and stays near the corresponding schwarzschild modes .",
    "it is surprising that the @xmath62 mode turns sharply at some specific kerr parameter approximately @xmath63 , which is not yet found for any non - rotating black hole .",
    "it is also noted that the mode of @xmath64 does not experience loops unlike a highly damped mode of the @xmath37 mode .",
    "this distinguishes the behavior of @xmath56 modes from that of the @xmath37 modes .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath65 modes is quite similar to that of the @xmath66 modes .",
    "4 shows how these modes move as the kerr parameter increases .",
    "as is easily seen , the @xmath67 modes move very fast compared with any other modes and these modes converge to a specific undamped frequency at the kerr limit .",
    "it is already known that the modes of the @xmath68 branch accumulate onto the critical frequency of super - radiance , @xmath69 .",
    "detweiler has shown that when @xmath70 an infinite number of modes cluster at the critical frequency .",
    "this suggests a marginally unstable feature of the extreme kerr black hole discussed by several authors @xcite , and this is quite interesting to investigate in detail . at present people",
    "believe that when the kerr parameter is close to the maximum the kerr parameter is decreased emitting the gravitational waves and losing rotational energy .",
    "then the black hole settles down to a stable non - extreme kerr black hole .",
    "you can also notice in fig .",
    "4 that not all the modes converge to the real critical frequency , but the sixth mode turns sharply at about @xmath71 and then limits to a complex value around @xmath72 .",
    "detweiler s result was that there are an infinite number of quasinormal modes converging to the critical frequency .",
    "our numerical results suggest that most of modes converge into the critical frequency but some modes still stay away from the critical frequency .",
    "we so far have calculated the modes up to @xmath73 but there was no other mode which does not converge into the critical frequency .",
    "it is also interesting that there seems to be some relation between the @xmath74 modes and the @xmath75 modes . as is shown in fig . 5",
    ", the both @xmath61 and @xmath67 modes start from the schwarzschild mode initially in the same direction and the both @xmath62 and @xmath76 modes moves in the opposite direction to the above two modes .",
    "therefore the trajectories of these two modes are tangent to each other . on the other hand , the @xmath37 mode moves into a non - correlated direction .",
    "it seems that the @xmath65 modes move just twice as fast as the @xmath77 mode initially .",
    "( this can be also confirmed by examining the @xmath78 case , where the @xmath79 mode moves three times as fast as the @xmath80 mode . )",
    "these feature can be understood , the @xmath65 modes are more distorted than the @xmath81 modes and hence the @xmath65 are more sensitive to the change of the kerr parameter that corresponds how much the spacetime is twisted .",
    "6 is a figure of the trajectories of the @xmath82 modes for the electromagnetic perturbations ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is very similar to the case of the @xmath83 modes .",
    "these modes also converges into the undamped critical frequency @xmath84 . owing to detweiler s argument",
    ", for any @xmath85 the @xmath86 modes have a similar accumulation of an infinite number of the quasinormal modes onto the critical frequency @xmath87 .",
    "there was one mode which never converge into the critical frequency for the @xmath11 case , however for the @xmath10 case no such mode was found up to @xmath0 .",
    "here we only consider the algebraically special mode of the @xmath11 gravitational perturbations , because the only known implication that there is a correlation between the algebraically special mode and the quasinormal mode is that both modes for the schwarzschild black hole coalesce for gravitational perturbations .",
    "the algebraically special perturbations were first considered by wald @xcite , who was interested in how the perturbation can be the only independent component among several weyl scalars .",
    "( actually it is impossible if you consider only the real frequency . )",
    "as is well known , the perturbations have generally two independent components @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which correspond to the ingoing and the outgoing wave , respectively .",
    "thus the algebraically special mode is the mode that has only an ingoing or outgoing wave .",
    "such kind of perturbations were first analytically solved by chandrasekhar @xcite . for the schwarzschild black hole",
    ", algebraically special frequency can be easily solved by imposing the condition that starobinsky s constant vanishes .",
    "( because two modes are related to each other with a starobinsky constant . )",
    "it is then found that there is such a mode on the imaginary axis at @xmath90 .    for the kerr black hole it is rather difficult to obtain the algebraically special frequencies owing to the difficulty to get the separation constant @xmath13 without resorting to numerical computation .",
    "nevertheless , if we use the continued fraction technique for the angular part of the teukolsky equations , the separation constant is accurately obtained .",
    "the square of the starobinsky constant is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the separation constant in chandrasekhar s notation , is related to ours with the relation @xmath94 therefore we only need to solve @xmath95 together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : cf - a ] ) .",
    "in contrast to quasinormal modes , algebraically special modes can be calculated even when the black hole is extreme , because we do not need to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : teu - rad ] ) which has two confluent singularities in the extremal limit .",
    "the solutions always appear as a pair , owing to a reflection symmetry about the real axis .",
    "it is also noticed that the symmetry of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : staro - c ] ) and ( [ eq : cf - a ] ) allows us to get the @xmath96 modes by reflecting the @xmath97 modes about the imaginary axis as in the quasinormal mode .",
    "therefore , it is enough to see the first quadrant .",
    "the solutions of @xmath52 branch which are obtained using the continued fraction scheme are plotted in fig . 7 together with chandrasekhar s result @xcite , and these values are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath37 mode increases along the imaginary axis initially as the kerr parameter increases and then goes away from the imaginary axis when @xmath98 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of the @xmath37 mode for @xmath99 still stays on the imaginary axis , but chandrasekhar mentioned that this mode does not satisfy a positivity of @xmath100 .",
    "this contradiction was caused , because his values were obtained using a separation constant with large numerical error , and thus his value was wrong .",
    "our values are all in agreement with this positivity check , since our scheme can avoid numerical errors . if you see fig .",
    "6 , there is no @xmath62 and @xmath76 mode in the first quadrant , and the @xmath61 and @xmath67 modes go horizontally from the imaginary axis like the quasinormal mode . despite",
    "that , there seems to be no correlation with any quasinormal mode .    from the point of view of the scattering problem ,",
    "a quasinormal mode is regarded as a pole of the reflection amplitude @xmath101 and the transmission amplitude @xmath102 , on the other hand , an algebraically special mode corresponds to a zero of @xmath101 .",
    "therefore these two modes will never coalesce in general , which is consistent with the above numerical results .",
    "superficially it might appear that these two modes coalesce at the schwarzschild limit , but we believe that the quasinormal mode disappears at the limit owing to a cancellation with the corresponding mode in the left - half of the complex plane .",
    "in this paper we have presented several hints to be useful for resolving a couple of questions concerning the quasinormal mode of the black hole .",
    "we have presented the results of detailed calculations of the quasinormal modes of the kerr black hole .",
    "this supplements previous studies in several ways .",
    "first , we take the rapidly damped mode into consideration .",
    "second , we also investigate precisely how these modes move as the kerr parameter approaches the limit .",
    "third , we also consider the relationship between the algebraically special mode and the quasinormal mode .    as was the case for the reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite",
    ", the highly damped @xmath37 kerr quasinormal modes generally spiral into the extreme values .",
    "though not presented in this paper , we have found the similar behavior also in the case of the test scalar field on the kerr background ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "therefore these spirals must be one of the fundamental features for rapidly damped modes .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath56 modes are , on the other hand , different from the behavior of the @xmath37 mode .",
    "the damping rates of @xmath104 modes decrease very fast without going through spirals .",
    "an infinite number of the @xmath105 modes tend to accumulate onto the critical frequency , @xmath106 , as @xmath107 .",
    "we also found that there is one mode which does not converge to the frequency .",
    "whether another mode like that exists is an open question . at present",
    "there is no evidence up to @xmath73 for @xmath52 gravitational perturbations .",
    "the @xmath108 modes have rather simple behavior in contrast to the positive @xmath57 cases .",
    "these modes move slowly around the corresponding schwarzschild modes .",
    "a interesting fact is that some of the modes go through a quick turn .",
    "these surprising features for @xmath56 were not yet found for the spherical black holes and hence should be considered in detail . since the @xmath56 modes do not exist for non - rotating black holes ( all the @xmath56 modes degenerate into the @xmath37 case owing to the spherical symmetry ) , these modes are actually specific for the rotating black holes .",
    "we also obtained the precise values of the algebraically special modes using a continued fraction method .",
    "there was no correlation between the algebraically special mode and the quasinormal mode except that these modes superficially coalesce in the schwarzschild limit .",
    "currently we do not know why the coalescence occurs .",
    "however , owing to the existence of the algebraically special mode at @xmath109 the quasinormal mode can not be there .",
    "two quasinormal modes coalesce and then probably cancel at the limit .",
    "this cancellation prevents the existence of the purely damped quasinormal mode .",

    "i wish to thank professor h.  ishihara for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work is supported in part by the jsps research fellowships for young scientists and the scientific research fund of the ministry of education .",
    ".the algebraically special modes calculated through the continued fraction algorithm are compared with those obtained in chandrasekhar s paper .",
    "the upper values are obtained through the continued fraction method and the lower values are from his paper .",
