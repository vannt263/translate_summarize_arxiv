    "( 1 ) by lemma [ lemmacomb2 ] , the vertices of @xmath56 move freely with respect to each other unless they are connected by an edge of @xmath56 or by an aligned path . since on this step",
    "it suffices to consider only first - order terms , we may think that each aligned diagonal of @xmath56 fixes the distance between its endpoints .",
