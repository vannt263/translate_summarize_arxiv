    "an optical scanner is a device constituted by two rotating planar mirrors which are used to deflect a laser beam along two perpendicular directions @xcite . among the different scanning techniques already developed , galvanometer - based scanners ( galvos ) offer flexibility ,",
    "speed and accuracy at a relatively low cost .",
    "in fact , optical scanners based on the current galvo technology permit to obtain closed - loop bandwidths of several khz and step response times in the 100  @xmath0 range even for beams with large radii .",
    "moreover , a resolution at the @xmath1 level can be achieved within a large scanning field , which is usually of the order of @xmath2 .    because of this superb properties , galvo scanners are the preferred solutions in many industrial and scientific applications requiring fast and precise beam steering capabilities , like medical imaging , information handling , laser display and material processing @xcite .",
    "in addition , galvos could find potential applications in any practical context where the light beam which should be steered and/or stabilized with high precision also has a well defined state of polarization , like in interferometry with polarized light @xcite , in ellipsometry @xcite or in polarization - sensitive optical coherence tomography @xcite .",
    "another important application might be in single - photon polarization - based quantum communications and quantum key distribution between two moving terminals , where a galvo scanner placed at the transmitter could be used to point and track the receiver with high accuracy .",
    "however , as the incidence angles of the beam with the two mirrors vary in function of their mutual position , the corresponding fresnel coefficients @xcite are subjected to a time - dependent change that affects the polarization state of the input beam",
    ". therefore , in this kind of applications it is of primary importance to understand how the polarization state of the output beam changes in function of the combined motion of the mirrors .",
    "the problem of the propagation of a polarized beam within a galvo scanner does not seem to have been treated before in the literature , since previous works were mainly aimed at studying beam path and image distortions @xcite .",
    "moreover , previous studies of the changes of the polarization state caused by reflections of a light beam upon moving mirrors refer to optical configurations quite different from that of an optical scanner , like the coud focus of a telescope @xcite , sky scanners @xcite and coelostats @xcite , or to more general cases of two - mirrors pointing and tracking systems @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the principal purpose of the present work is to give a theoretical description of the effects on the polarization state of a light beam caused by the motion of the two mirrors of a galvo scanner .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : galvoscanner ] we introduce the optical configuration of a galvo scanner and calculate the matrix that gives the propagation direction of the output beam . in section  [ sec : polchange ] we obtain the jones matrix of the galvo scanner . in section  [ sec : lossless ] we discuss the polarization change under conditions of lossless mirrors , while in section  [ sec : rotop ] we give a description in terms of rotation operators .",
    "in general , a galvo scanner allows to control independently the direction of the output beam along two perpendicular axis by rotating the two mirrors about the axis of the corresponding galvanometers . we shall call these axis the `` rotation axis '' of the mirrors .",
    "the first mirror ( m1 ) controls the deflection of the output beam along the horizontal direction ( left / right ) , while the second mirror ( m2 ) controls the deflection along the vertical direction ( up / down ) .",
    "both these deflections are usually referred to a predefined `` zero position '' of m1 and m2 . given a right - handed reference frame @xmath3",
    ", we consider the galvo mirrors to be at their zero positions when an input beam initially propagating along the positive @xmath4 axis will come out along the positive @xmath5 axis .",
    "according to this definition , the wave vector of the input beam is @xmath6 $ ] , while that of the output beam is @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the mutual orientation of the two mirrors when they are at the zero position is a critical parameter that defines the performances of a galvo scanner .",
    "in fact , the distance between their surfaces and the angular range of the scanning field usually requires the size of m2 to be larger than that of m1 .",
    "because of this , m2 is the component that strongly limits the speed of the entire scanning system .    in the simplest scheme of a galvo scanner , the rotation axis of m1 and m2",
    "correspond with the positive @xmath5 axis and the negative @xmath4 axis , respectively .",
    "the zero position is achieved when the vector normal to the reflective surface of m1 is @xmath8 $ ] and the vector normal to the surface of m2 is @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "starting from this simple configuration , the optical design is usually optimized by rotating m1 by an angle @xmath10 about the positive @xmath4 axis , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : galvo ] .",
    "this configuration presents the advantage to reduce both width and moment of inertia of m2 and reduce the overall size of the scanner , with only slight limitations on the speed with respect to the simple scheme . in the following",
    ", we will consider this optimized design because it is the most common configuration of current galvo scanners .    in order to find the zero positions of the mirrors , we have firstly to introduce the criterion to describe rotations that will be used throughout the paper",
    ". any rotation by an angle @xmath11 about an axis @xmath12 will be defined using the `` right - hand rule '' , such that a vector @xmath13 rotates according to @xmath14 .",
    "for example , a rotation about the positive @xmath4 axis rotates @xmath5 toward @xmath15 and @xmath15 toward @xmath16 . according to this criterion ,",
    "the zero position of m1 is obtained by starting from a configuration in which the normal to its surface is directed along the negative @xmath4 axis and , then , by rotating it by @xmath17 about the positive @xmath5 axis and by an angle @xmath18 about the positive @xmath4 axis .",
    "it can be easily shown that the zero position of m2 is simply obtained , starting from a configuration in which the normal to its surface is directed along the positive @xmath5 axis , by rotating it about the positive @xmath4 axis by an angle @xmath19 .",
    "the deflection of the output beam along the @xmath4 axis ( horizontal ) is the result of a rotation of m1 by an angle @xmath20 about its rotation axis , starting from its zero position .",
    "therefore , the normal to the surface of m1 is generally defined by @xmath21~.\\ ] ] instead , the motion of the output beam along the @xmath15 axis ( vertical ) is achieved by rotating m2 by an angle @xmath22 about its rotation axis , starting from its zero position . in general , the normal to the surface of m2 has the following vectorial expression : @xmath23~.\\ ] ]    obviously , when @xmath24 or @xmath25 , the propagation vector of the output beam , @xmath26 , is no longer parallel to the @xmath5 axis .      before proceeding with the analysis of the polarization transformation",
    "we need to calculate the matrix that transforms the initial propagation direction @xmath27 into the final one , @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the mirrors are perfectly flat , with no deformation occurring while rotating . as a matter of fact ,",
    "galvo mirrors are usually mass balanced about their centers of rotation .",
    "this solution presents the minimum polar moment of inertia and , therefore , permits to minimize the bending moments that are generated whenever an eccentric mass is rotated @xcite . under this condition ,",

    "the calculation of the polarization state of the output beam is made following a procedure quite similar to that explained in @xcite , which is essentially a polarization ray - tracing approach @xcite .    for a galvo scanner ,",
    "the phenomenon which mainly affects the polarization of the output beam is the reflection upon the two mirrors . when the characteristics of a mirror are known , the effects on the polarization state of a light beam due to reflection can be treated using the jones matrices and the fresnel coefficients @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the optical properties of a two - axis galvanometric optical scanner constituted by a pair of rotating planar mirrors , focusing our attention on the transformation induced on the polarization state of the input beam . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the matrix that defines the transformation of the propagation direction of the beam and the jones matrix that defines the transformation of the polarization state . </S>",
    "<S> both matrices are expressed in terms of the rotation angles of two mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate the parameters of the general rotation in the poincar sphere that describes the change of polarization state for each mutual orientation of the mirrors . </S>"
