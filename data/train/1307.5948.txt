    "it is known that quantum gravity is hoped to resolve the initial singularity of the universe and assign a proper initial condition with a reasonable probability , where the corresponding wavefunction of the universe is discribed by the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite . in order to obtain a unique solution to this equation , one natural idea to fix",
    "the boundary condition is to choose the initial state such that it most closely resembles the ground state , or the euclidean vacuum state .",
    "moreover , it is known that the euclidean vacuum state wavefunction in standard quantum theory can be obtained by the euclidean path integral .",
    "hence , hartle and hawking @xcite generalized it to the case of gravity , and introduced the euclidean path integral to choose the wavefunction of the universe , @xmath3 = \\int_{\\partial g = h , \\partial \\phi = \\chi } \\mathcal{d}g\\mathcal{d}\\phi \\;\\;e^{-s_{\\mathrm{e}}[g,\\phi ] } , \\label{psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the metric of a compact 3-geometry @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the matter ( inflaton ) field @xmath7 on @xmath5 , which form the boundary of all possible , regular 4-geometries and matter configurations over which the path integral is to be performed .",
    "this is called the _ no - boundary proposal_. however it is known that the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal is in severe conflict with the realization of successful inflation @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that an @xmath8-symmetric solution gives the lowest action for a wide class of sc alar - field theories , hence dominating the path integral ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "so it is reasonable to assume that the metric owns the @xmath8 symmetry even in the presence of gravity @xcite , @xmath9 on the other hand , under the steepest - descent approximation ( or equivalently , wkb approximation ) where the wavefunction is dominated by sum - over on - shell histories , the corresponding actions are complex - valued , @xmath10 \\simeq a[\\tilde{a},\\tilde{\\phi } ] e^{i s[\\tilde{a},\\tilde{\\phi } ] } , \\label{eq : class}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the boundary values of @xmath13 and @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real - valued functions .",
    "when the phase @xmath15 varies much faster than @xmath14 , @xmath16\\right|\\ll \\left|\\nabla_i s[\\tilde{a},\\tilde{\\phi}]\\right| , \\qquad i=\\tilde{a},\\tilde{\\phi},\\ ] ] these histories are classical since it satisfies the semi - classical halilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "thus , provided that the potential is exactly flat , if the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 are such that they form a maximal slice of an @xmath8 symmetric regular euclidean solution , that is , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the values at which @xmath17 , then the probability of the existence of such a classical universe is evaluated as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is half the euclidean action of the solution with the maximal slice at which @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at the maximal slice",
    "the euclidean solution can be analytically continued to a lorentzian classical solution , and a classical universe is born with its initial data given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this analysis can be applied to evaluate the probability of creation of a universe that has witnessed an early inflationary era , at which the potential satisfies the slow - roll conditions . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the chaotic inflationary scenario where the potential @xmath22 with @xmath23 has reflection symmetric around @xmath24 and monotonically increases as @xmath25 increases . in einstein gravity , there is a continuous distribution of complex - valued instantons for @xmath26 ( hereafter , we adopt the natural units @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 is a cutoff scale below which the classicality condition is no longer satisfied  @xcite .",
    "when there are approximately classical euclidean solutions , the slow - roll condition is generally satisfied in the lorentzian regime , and the euclidean action is approximately given by @xmath29 inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) , one immediately obtains the probability of creation of such a universe : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the corresponding e - folding number defined by @xmath32 .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) that an early universe with a large vacuum energy or large number of @xmath0-folds is exponentially suppressed .",
    "hence , a successful inflationary scenario with sufficient e - folding number ( e.g. 50 - 60 e - folding numbers ) is disfavored , which is thought to be a defect of the no - boundary proposal ( for alternative explanations and reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this severe problem can be naturally solved in a modified gravity theory with a non - vanishing graviton mass , that is , the so - called massive gravity theory .",
    "recently , with various motivations , massive gravity models have been extensively studied . in this paper , we consider nonlinear massive gravity proposed by derham , gabadadze and tolley  @xcite , the so - called drgt massive gravity , @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the inflaton and @xmath34 is the massive gravity term given by @xmath35^{2 } - \\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{2}\\right ] \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha_{3}\\frac{1}{6 } \\left ( \\left [ \\mathcal{k } \\right]^{3 } - 3\\left [ \\mathcal{k } \\right]\\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{2}\\right ] + \\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{3}\\right ] \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha_{4}\\frac{1}{24 } \\bigl ( \\left [ \\mathcal{k } \\right]^{4 }   - 6 \\left [ \\mathcal{k } \\right]^{2 } \\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{2}\\right ] + 3 \\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{2}\\right]^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad+ 8   \\left [ \\mathcal{k } \\right]\\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{3}\\right ] - 6\\left [ \\mathcal{k}^{4}\\right ] \\bigr)\\biggr]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 being a graviton mass parameter , @xmath37 and @xmath38 being non - dimensional parameters , and @xmath39 the fields @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) are called the stckelberg fields whose role is to recover the general covariance .",
    "we set the fiducial , field space metric @xmath42 to be a de sitter metric  @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the curvature radius of the fiducial metric . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume @xmath42 to be non - dynamical as in the original drgt gravity  @xcite .",
    "however , the theory may be more consistently formulated if @xmath46 is made dynamical  @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss further this issue here since it is beyond the scope of this short article .    under the assumption of @xmath8 symmetry , we set @xmath47 .",
    "then after a straightforward calculation , we obtain @xmath48 , where  @xcite @xmath49 we note that @xmath50 must be positive .",
    "this constrains the parameter space of the theory .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath51 where a dot ( @xmath52 ) denotes @xmath53 , a prime ( @xmath54 ) denotes @xmath55 , and the effective potential is given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the cosmological constant due to the massive gravity terms , @xmath58\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these equations of motion , we obtain the on - shell action as  @xcite @xmath59\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60    now we assume that the potential is sufficiently flat so that at leading order approximation we can set @xmath61 , hence @xmath62 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 . then the action ( over the half hemisphere )",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 comparing eq .",
    "( [ semg ] ) to  ( [ segr ] ) , using the friedman equation @xmath68 , one finds that a counter term proportional to @xmath36 appears in drgt massive gravity theory , which drastically changes the behavior of wavefunction so that the distribution of probability may not peak at @xmath69 .",
    "it should be noted that the above approximation is valid as long as the slow - roll condition is satisfied and the field value is well outside the cutoff , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "the function @xmath71 as a function of the normalized hubble parameter @xmath72 for @xmath73 ( dashed ) , @xmath74 ( red ) , @xmath75 ( green ) , and @xmath76 ( blue ) from top to bottom .",
    "as has been expected , in traditional einstein gravity where @xmath77 , the probability will exponentially decrease when @xmath78 increases , which implies disfavor of inflation with a large number of e - foldings .",
    "however , in drgt massive gravity , counter terms proportional to @xmath36 appear so that the probability peaks at much larger @xmath78 .",
    "this implies the preference of a much larger e - folding number for a successful inflationary scenario , hence offers a way to realize inflation in the context of quantum gravity . ]",
    "as mentioned above , we must have @xmath80 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath81 must be in the range @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for definiteness , we also assume @xmath83 . from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , @xmath84 , which implies that the absolute value of @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) is smaller in the massive gravity case than in the einstein case , provided with the same value of @xmath87 .",
    "alternatively , if we fix the model parameters and vary @xmath87 , @xmath88 as @xmath89 while it approaches 1/3 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "then there arises a hope that the probability of a universe with small @xmath87 may be substantially suppressed , or conversely the probability of a universe with larger @xmath87 is exponentially enhanced .    to see if this is the case or not , let us introduce variable @xmath93 and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ semg ] ) in the following form : @xmath94\\cr & \\equiv&-\\frac{4\\pi^2}{x_\\pm^2f^2}q(u)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 .",
    "then one finds @xmath96 the function @xmath71 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotq ] as a function of the normalized hubble parameter @xmath97 , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "it is readily seen that unlike the case for traditional einstein gravity where @xmath77 ( dashed line ) , in drgt massive gravity theory , the function @xmath98 , hence @xmath99 will be maximized at @xmath100 where @xmath101 since the left - hand side varies monotonicallly from zero to infinity as @xmath102 varies in the range @xmath103 , there always exists a unique maximum provided that both @xmath50 and @xmath104 are positive .",
    "thus the probability is maximized at @xmath100 with the exponent given by @xmath105 which may be well approximated by @xmath106 when @xmath107 .",
    "we see that the problem of the no - boundary proposal may be solved for a sufficiently wide range of the parameter space . for example , assuming both @xmath50 and @xmath104 are of order unity , we may consider the case @xmath108 which implies @xmath109",
    ". inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ lnp ] ) , one finds @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the hubble parameter at which the probability is maximized .",
    "thus a classical universe emerges most probably with the hubble parameter @xmath112 . for @xmath36 close to the planck scale",
    "this gives sufficient inflation .",
    "we have shown that for a sufficiently large mass parameter @xmath1 the problem associated with the no - boundary proposal that the expected number of @xmath0-folds is too small to realize successful inflation may be solved . however , since we know that the graviton mass should be extremely small today , we need a mechanism to make it large only in the very early universe .    here",
    "we present a couple of speculations for such a mechanism .",
    "+ ( 1 ) _ field - dependent mass _ : let us consider the case when @xmath36 is a function of the inflaton @xmath7  @xcite . @xmath113",
    "if @xmath36 is finite for @xmath114 but exponentially small for @xmath115 , then our analysis in the case of massive gravity is still valid and the fact that there is no classical histories at @xmath115 remains the same as in the einstein case  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there will be a long enough inflationary stage , and einstein gravity will be recovered when the inflation ends at @xmath115 .",
    "for example , a simple function like @xmath116 $ ] seems to satisfy the requirement . of course , however , we need a more thorough analysis before we may conclude that such a model can actually lead to the scenario described above ( some discussions on its dynamics have been done in some references , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "\\(2 ) _ running mass parameter _ : quantum effects may change @xmath36 through energy scales .",
    "if gravitational interactions are not asymptotically free , then one may have a large graviton mass @xmath117 at the planck energy scale , while it becomes small @xmath118 at the current energy scale , where @xmath119 is the current expansion rate of the universe .",
    "if this scenario works , it may be also possible to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe simultaneously .",
    "studies of hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal for the wavefunction of the universe in the context of drgt massive gravity opens a window to discuss inflationary scenario in quantum gravity theories .",
    "traditionally , the no - boundary wavefunction exponentially prefers small number of @xmath0-foldings near the minimum of the inflaton potential , and hence it does not seem to predict the universe we observe today .",
    "however , we found that the contribution from the massive gravity sector can drastically change this situation .",
    "we showed that , for a fairly wide range of the parameters of the theory , the no - boundary wavefunction can have a peak at a sufficiently large value of the hubble parameter so that one obtains a sufficient number of @xmath0-folds of inflation .    to make this model to work , however , we need to find a way to trigger the mass parameter in the very early universe while it should remain to be extremely small in the current universe .",
    "we speculated a couple of mechanisms for this purpose .",
    "it is a future issue to see if these mechanisms can be actually implemented in massive gravity .",
    "in addition , we remain a future issue to consider the implication of potential problems of the drgt model @xcite and applications for possible generalized massive gravity models that may not suffer from such problems , e.g. , @xcite .",
