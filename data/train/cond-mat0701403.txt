    "such a class contains both superconducting ( squids ) and non - superconducting devices .    in this paper",
    "we study selected kinetic aspects of persistent currents which can be observed in normal metal , semiconducting rings or cylinders and , as probably the most famous examples , in carbon nanotubes or nanotori .",
    "we focus our attention on kinetics of magnetic flux in the presence of a strong external static magnetic field .",
    "we show that it can be modeled in the same way as the dynamics of a brownian particle moving in a biased washboard potential . here",
    ", the analog of the position of the brownian particle is a total magnetic flux .",
    "we show that the time derivative of the magnetic flux , i.e. the flux velocity ( if we recall the analogy to the dynamics of the brownian particle ) depends strongly on the ability of accommodation of persistent currents by the ring .",
    "persistent currents are equilibrium currents flowing in the aharonov - bohm systems which are small enough to preserve phase coherence of electrons @xcite . in ideal samples at the vanishing temperature @xmath0 ,",
    "all electrons are the carriers of such a current .",
    "it is not the case at non - zero temperatures @xmath1 , when some of the electrons are no longer coherent and are a source of the normal ohmic current .",
    "let us consider now a mesoscopic ring placed in a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "because of the self - inductance @xmath3 , the electric current @xmath4 will induce a magnetic flux @xmath5 in the ring .",
    "therefore , the flux and the current in the ring are coupled according to the expression @xmath6.\\ ] ] the flux @xmath7 is induced by the external magnetic field @xmath2 .",

    "this is related to occurrence , with a probability @xmath10 , of the so called current channel with an even number of coherent electrons or an odd number of coherent electrons , with a probability @xmath11 .",

    "the third one , @xmath73 $ ] , describes the structure of current channels as it is the probability of occurring current channel carrying even number of phase coherent electrons .",
    "let us notice that , due to quantum size effects , persistent currents are always present in a sufficiently small system , i.e. there are always electrons maintaining their phase coherence when moving around the ring .",
    "the problem is if @xmath72 is sufficiently large for those electrons to produce significant contribution to the total current flowing in the system at a given temperature .",
    "numerical results show that upon inspection of the properties of the flux velocity @xmath74 one can infer when the given ring is able to accommodate persistent current of a significant amplitude at a given temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present the relation between the flux velocity and the temperature @xmath75 for several different values of the current amplitude @xmath72 .",
    "the general tendency is that in the presence of persistent currents the flux velocity is suppressed at the low temperature @xmath75 or large @xmath72 .",
    "there are two classes of the systems split by the critical value @xmath37 of the current amplitude @xmath72 , which determines the inflection points of the potential",
    ". this qualitative change is defined by a set of two equations : @xmath38 and @xmath39 and is presented in fig [ fig:2 ] . for @xmath76 , barriers of the potential @xmath56 exist . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the potential is a monotonic function of the flux @xmath78 .",
    "systems from the first class , with the supercritical amplitude @xmath36 , exhibit _ vanishing _ flux velocity for @xmath79 . for the second class systems , with the subcritical amplitude @xmath80 , the flux velocity decreases but remains _ finite _ as temperature @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that in the formal limit @xmath82 , the flux velocity is constant , @xmath83 . the critical value @xmath84 is estimated for the ring with @xmath34 .    in fig .",
    "4 , the probability @xmath10 of a channel with an even number of coherent electrons is chosen as a parameter . for the system with statistically equal number of channels of both types ( @xmath34 ) , the flux velocity is greater than for systems with one type of channels dominating over the other ( e.g. @xmath85 ) .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath86 and @xmath85 coincide with @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively and there is no way to distinguish with type of channels dominates in the ring .    in order to quantify the effect",
    ", one can define the susceptibility , i.e. the temperature derivative of the averaged stationary flux velocity at fixed values of other parameters .",
    "its monotonicity characterizes the possibility of obtaining persistent currents in the system . with this function",
    "one can associate a measure of the ability of accommodating persistent currents in the ring .",
    "this measure could be defined as a distance , in the sense of a metric in a function space , between the given ( non - zero ) susceptibility and the zero susceptibility .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that performing suitable limiting procedure one can obtain new significant informations about persistent currents in mesorings .",
    "investigations of global properties of the flux velocity can serve as an additional characteristics of mesoscopic rings .",
    "the perfect example is the monotonicity of the temperature derivative of the flux velocity or its asymptotic behavior at low temperatures which carries information about possibility of appearing persistent currents in the ring .",
