    "the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite is capable of giving a simple yet realistic description of nuclear collective motions . in its original version ( ibm-1 ) ,",
    "only one kind of boson is considered , corresponding to fully proton neutron symmetric states .",
    "the neutron - proton extension of the model ( ibm-2 ) , predicts a new class of states @xcite having mixed symmetry in the proton and neutron degrees of freedom , and it has been successfully observed in various experiments@xcite .    in lighter nuclei ,",
    "the valence protons and neutrons fill the same major shell and isospin should be taken into account . in order to include the isospin , ibm has been extended to the interacting boson model with isospin ( ibm-3)@xcite . in ibm-3 three types of bosons are included : proton - proton @xmath6 , neutron - neutron @xmath7 and proton - neutron @xmath8 which forms the isospin @xmath9 multiplet .",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 bosons have the isospin projection @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the wave functions can be classified by the @xmath14 group @xcite , where @xmath15 is the usual isospin group .",
    "dynamical symmetries of the ibm3 have been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 of ibm-1 goes to @xmath17 group for ibm-3 as its dynamical symmetry group .",
    "the natural chains below @xmath18 start with @xmath19 , and they must contain @xmath20 and @xmath21 as subgroups because the angular momentum and the isospin are good quantum numbers . the chains beginning with @xmath22 and satisfying the above requirement are the following @xcite    @xmath23    the subgroups @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe vibrational , @xmath27- unstable and rotational nuclei respectively@xcite .",
    "the existence of the isospin excitations in light nuclei has received interest in the last few years@xcite .",
    "such renewed interest was sparked by discovery of states with isospin @xmath28 .",
    "the cr isotopes have been the subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations . on the experimental side , large @xmath29 ray detector arrays are now available , and they have increased the detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude . meanwhile shell model calculations in full fp shell",
    "can now be performed .",
    "detailed description of the yrast band structure in the full fp space has been reported in @xmath30cr @xcite and @xmath31cr@xcite respectively .",
    "experimentally , the positive parity yrast band was extended up to the band termination and turned out to be in good agreement with the shell model prediction@xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of backbending mechanism of @xmath30cr has been done using projected shell model@xcite . in @xmath32 the first backbending at @xmath33 and second backbending at @xmath34",
    "have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the high spin states and electromagnetic transitions have been investigated and compared with the shell model results@xcite .",
    "recently microscopic three - cluster model calculations were also performed in an attempt to explain the bands structure properties@xcite . however a comprehensive analysis of the low - lying levels in these nuclei are still missing .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the low - lying levels in the ibm-3 , in particular to investigate the isospin and f - spin contents of the levels .",
    "this paper is divided as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the interacting boson model with isospin . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we present the results of our calculation for the energy levels and compared with available data , and analyze the isospin and f - spin structure of the results .",
    "a discussion of electromagnetic transitions follows in section [ s4 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ s5 ] we summarize our results .",
    "the most general ibm-3 hamiltonian can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37^{00},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the dot product in both angular momentum and isospin .",
    "the tilted quantity is defined as @xmath38 the symbols @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the two- boson system isospin and angular momentum .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related to the two - body matrix elements by @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 and by @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are similar to the majorana interactions in the ibm-2 which will be referred also as majorana interactions .",
    "these interactions are important to shift the states with mixed symmetry with respect to the total symmetric ones .",
    "since only a little experimental information is known about such states in the nuclei under study , we attempt to vary the parameters appearing in these terms to fit the energy of available experimental data on @xmath59 and other state which are sensitive to these parameters .    the values of parameters were chosen according to the microscopic studies in ref @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the whole spectrum can be found .",
    "we have rewritten the hamiltonian in terms of linear combination of casimir operators which is convenient to analyze the dynamical symmetry nature .",
    "the expressions of the casimir operators can be found in ref.@xcite . in casimir operator form ,",
    "the hamiltonians are @xmath60 for @xmath0cr isotopes respectively .",
    "the corresponding parameters in the form of eq.([e3 ] ) are also given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the @xmath61 determines the position of the mixed symmetry states . in @xmath31cr , there is one @xmath62 state at 3.629 mev , and this requires @xmath63 mev .",
    "we then use the same value for @xmath64cr isotope because no experimental information is available in this isotope .",
    "it can be seen from the casimir operator form that the hamiltonian of @xmath30cr is more rotational than that of @xmath31cr because the coefficient of @xmath65 in @xmath30cr is much less than that in @xmath31cr . in @xmath31cr",
    "the coefficient of @xmath66 is very large , and this indicates that it is more close to the @xmath67 limit and is in transition from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "we assume@xmath69ni as the closed core and the bosons in the current study corresponding to pairs of hole fermions",
    ". the energy levels are shown in figs . [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "good agreement between the calculated and observed spectrum is confirmed up to @xmath70 . the energy levels and wave - functions",
    "are obtained using a computer program written by van isacker @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to see that the sequence of bands with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 has been produced , and is in a good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "the @xmath74- band with @xmath75 is the first and second excited band in @xmath76cr and @xmath31cr respectively . in fig.[f1 ] we also draw the ground state band of @xmath64ti where the lowest isospin is @xmath77 which should be close to the isospin analogue state in @xmath76cr .",
    "here we have assumed that the ground state energy of @xmath76 ti is equal to that of the ibm3 calculated @xmath78 state in @xmath30cr .",
    "this is supported by the following estimate .",
    "we estimate the energy of the isospin analogue state in @xmath30cr by considering the binding energy difference of @xmath30cr and @xmath30ti and then subtracting the coulomb energy difference .",
    "this estimation is crude because coulomb energy depends on the shape of the nucleus sensitively . by using the tables in ref.@xciteand the following coulomb energy formula @xmath79 we obtained the energy of the @xmath77 isospin analogue state in @xmath30cr to be @xmath80 mev which is close to the energy of the @xmath81 mev in our ibm-3 calculation .",
    "the energy levels in those figures show that there is good agreement in the ground state and @xmath82 bands in general .",
    "the following points need special attention . in @xmath30cr ,",
    "the @xmath83 state appears at 6.188 mev in our calculation , and it is not yet seen in experiment . in @xmath31cr",
    "the ibm-3 predicts the first @xmath84 at 3.823 mev and the second @xmath85 at 5.921 mev .",
    "these states are both from the @xmath86 $ ] @xmath87 irreducible representation . here",
    "we have the @xmath87 labeling as it is a good quantum number approximately .",
    "the first and second @xmath88 in @xmath0cr are in good agreement with experimental data , and @xmath89 state in @xmath30cr and @xmath90 state in @xmath31cr are mixed symmetry states . in both nuclei",
    "the first @xmath91 state is a solely mixed symmetry state .    to identify the mixed symmetry states",
    ", one can make use of their electromagnetic transition properties : weakly e2 and strong m1 decay to ground state and first @xmath92 state respectively @xcite .",
    "mixed symmetry @xmath93 state in light nuclei have been identified in @xmath94cr , @xmath95fe@xcite , @xmath69fe @xcite and @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the mixed symmetry structure of wave functions can be seen by calculating the @xmath97 value .",

    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] one can see this fact and therefore the lowest mixed symmetry state in @xmath30cr has high energy .",

    "the energy of these observed states are well reproduced by the calculation .",
    "we have varied each of majorana parameters around the best - value and keeping all other parameters at their best - fit values , the variations of the energy of these states with the parameters are shown in figs [ f3]-[f6 ] . in @xmath30cr",
    "the mixed symmetry component of the lowest mixed symmetry band belongs predominantly to the partition @xmath111 $ ] with @xmath112 .",
    "the second mixed symmetry state @xmath106 has the partition @xmath86 $ ] with @xmath113 with energy 6.110 mev , it is very close to experimental level at 6.100 mev @xmath114 @xcite . starting with this mixed state , a whole band of mixed states",
    "is predicted by this ibm3 calculation . in the same time",
    "the lowest mixed symmetry bands in @xmath31cr have the partition @xmath86 $ ] with @xmath115 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . because ibm-3 has three charge states , it is possible to have @xmath87 partitions into three rows , namely the @xmath116 $ ] states which are characteristic of ibm-3 .",
    "we found that such state come high in energy , upwards at about 8.5 mev , and the lowest example being a scissor mode state in @xmath30cr at 8.599 mev which is predominantly the @xmath117 $ ] partition with @xmath118 .",
    "the present calculation predicts that it decays to @xmath119 by strongly m1 transition with @xmath120 and weakly e2 transition with @xmath121 .",
    "it is very significant if these properties are observed in experiment .",
    "the e2 transition is described by the following isoscalar and isovector one boson e2 operators @xmath122 @xcite @xmath123 + \\beta_{0}\\sqrt{3}[(d^{+}\\hat{d})^{20}\\\\ \\label{e10 } q^{1}&=&\\alpha_{1}\\sqrt{2}[(s^{+}\\hat{d})^{21}+(d^{+}\\hat{s})^{21}]+ \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{2}[(d^{+}\\hat{d})]^{21}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the m1 transition is also a one boson operator with an isoscalar part and an isovector part @xmath124@xcite , @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the isovector and isoscalar @xmath128-factor respectively and @xmath129 is angular momentum operator .",
    "having obtained the wave function for states , we can calculate the electromagnetic transition rate between states using the subroutine of lac @xcite . in order to link it with energy code ,",
    "we have made some modification .",
    "the parameters in the e2 operator are adjusted to fit the experimental data of @xmath130 , where @xmath131 for@xmath30cr and @xmath31cr respectively and @xmath132 for both isotopes .",

    "the @xmath133 values between the yrast states are well reproduced .",
    "the calculated @xmath134 and @xmath135 are quite close to the experimental values , in the same time the calculated @xmath136 in @xmath137cr is larger than the experimental one by about @xmath138 . from these tables",
    "one can see that the transitions between states with the same partition are larger than transition between states with different @xmath87 labels .",
    "the isovector part @xmath139 of the transition from @xmath140 and higher energy @xmath92 mixed symmetry states to ground state and first @xmath106 state respectively is analyzed .",
    "the result is consistent with the identification of the @xmath59 and the lowest @xmath141 in the these two nuclei . from the m1 operator ,",
    "the isoscalar part is simply the angular momentum , m1 transition are determined by @xmath142 part only . for a good reproduction of calculated m1 transition we used the @xmath143 for the @xmath30cr and @xmath31cr .",

    "the relative b(e2 ) transitions between the states @xmath153 and @xmath154 have different isospin values are calculated and summarized in figs . [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] respectively .",
    "summarizing our results we may conclude that the ibm-3 description of the low - lying levels in the @xmath0cr nuclei is satisfactory .",
    "we have shown , on the basis of energy levels and electromagnetic properties , the presence of mixed symmetry states near 5 and 3 mev in @xmath155cr respectively . in @xmath30cr the @xmath98 state at 5.069",
    "mev decays predominantly to the @xmath156 state via a pure m1 transition , while in @xmath31cr the @xmath99 state decays through strongly m1 and weakly though e2 transition decay to @xmath156 .",
    "theses states are the candidate lowest mixed symmetry states in @xmath0cr respectively . in our calculation the scissor mode @xmath59 states in these nuclei lie higher than the lowest mixed symmetry @xmath157 states , which were observed at 3.629 mev in @xmath31cr .",
    "no mixed symmetry state labeled with @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath102 exists in @xmath30cr , and this is a natural result of group reduction . as a result , the scissor state in @xmath30cr nucleus is higher than that in @xmath31cr .",
    "the calculated results are in good agreement with available experimental data , but more experiment data for those nuclei are needed to validate this nuclear structure predicted .",
    "in particular , the present calculations suggest a combined isospin and mixed symmetry excitation in the low - lying levels of these nuclei .",
    "the present calculation also predicts the existence of row - rowed partition state at about 9 mev , and this type of states is typical of ibm3 , not present in ibm1 and ibm2 .",
