    "we have developed a new algorithm to better decode single molecule data with dynamic disorder .",

    ", we applied our algorithm to the single molecule fret time traces of h - dna .",
    "while duplex - triplex transitions of h - dna are conventionally interpreted in terms of two - state kinetics , slowly varying dynamic patterns corresponding to hidden internal states can also be identified from the individual time traces .",
    "our algorithm reveals that at least 4 distinct internal states are required to correctly interpret the data .",
    "recent technological advances in single molecule experiments on biomolecules have provided an unprecedented chance to investigate dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids at single molecule ( sm ) level , which has previously been elusive in conventional experiments @xcite .",
    "folding / unfolding pathways gleaned from individual sm trajectories indicate rugged folding landscapes inherent to biomolecules @xcite .",
    "long time trajectories from sm measurements , which now can be extended more than hundreds seconds , allow us to address how a rugged conformational landscape is sampled over time @xcite .",
    "one of the striking findings from these measurements is that even under the same folding condition , conformational dynamics of individual molecules differ substantially from one another while still maintaining their biological functions . cofactor - induced conformational transitions of _ t_. ribozymes @xcite , holliday junctions @xcite , tpp - riboswitch @xcite , and preq@xmath1-riboswitch @xcite are the recent seminal examples that exhibit molecular heterogeneity at equilibrium . the variation in the velocities of individual recbcd helicase motors along the dsdna @xcite is a good example of the molecular heterogeneity out of equilibrium , driven by atp hydrolysis .",
    "together with other reports @xcite , these could be merely a subset of more widespread , yet unrecognized cases that exhibit dynamical heterogeneity in sm time traces .",
    "the chance of conformational frustration increases with the system size ( @xmath2 ) . for a given @xmath2 , the time for conformational sampling ( @xmath3 ) is expected to scale as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 , which is in practice limited by several factors @xcite , is long enough to observe many ( more than hundreds ) transitions along a trace generated from sm measurement .",
    "two distinct scenarios arise depending on the length of @xmath3 relative to @xmath5 , ( i ) if the sampling time is shorter than @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , then the conformational space of biomolecule is fully sampled . in this case",
    ", the ergodicity of the system is ensured such that for any molecule @xmath7 ( or time trace @xmath7 ) the time average of an observable @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is equivalent to the ensemble average of @xmath10 over all @xmath7 s ( @xmath11 ) at any moment @xmath12 , @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 ; thus thermodynamic properties of the system can be read out by analyzing a single time trace .",
    "( ii ) in contrast , if @xmath15 is satisfied due to ruggedness of conformational space characterised with a number of deep local basins of attraction , then each time trace can sample only a local region of the conformational space . in this case , dynamic pattern from each time trace would look different , and a change in the dynamic pattern from one time interval to another would be observed only occasionally .    to be more precise about the second scenario ( @xmath15 ) , suppose that the average time scale for each local basin of attraction to be  sampled \" by the conformational dynamics of molecule is @xmath16 and that the time for the molecule to make transitions between different superbasins of attraction is @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_r_landscape ] ) . in principle",
    "the relaxation rates and energy barrier heights of biomolecules span continuous spectra .",
    "so , the clear time scale separation may not always be waranteed .",
    "however , to be able to grasp the presence of dynamic disorder , if any , in sm time traces straightforwardly , a separation between two distinct time scales is required such that @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) . if @xmath16 and @xmath17 were comparable ( or the spectra of relaxation rates were uniform and continuous ) , an algorithm we will propose here as well as others could hardly be of any help to conceive a concrete landscape model as the one illustrated in fig.[fig_r_landscape ] .",
    "therefore , here we consider @xmath16 and @xmath17 as two disparate time scales as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_r_landscape ] .",
    "@xmath16 is the time at which the time average of an observable @xmath20 reaches its steady state value when @xmath21 , corresponding to a time scale in which to fully sample the local basin of attraction .",
    "alternatively , @xmath16 is limited by a kinetic barrier with the greatest @xmath22 within the local basin of attraction , so that @xmath23 . on the other hand , @xmath17 is the transition time that is expected to scale with the height of kinetic barriers ( @xmath24 ) between the two superbasins as @xmath25 .",
    "when measurements are conducted with a finite duration of observation time ( @xmath5 ) , we can conceive two entirely different dynamic patterns depending on the relationship between @xmath26 , and @xmath5 :     is the transition time between different superbasins of attraction whereas @xmath16 is the time scale of conformational dynamics of molecule _ within _ each basin . due to large difference in kinetic barriers ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 . ]    * @xmath29 : the interconversion time between distinct basins of attractions is far longer than the observation time .",
    "the dynamic patterns from individual trajectories that sample distinct basin of attraction are expected to differ from each other . since @xmath30",
    ", there is few chance to observe an exchange of dynamic pattern in a single time trace , which corresponds to a case with quenched disorder that each sm time trace looks entirely different .",
    "such cases are reported in holliday junction @xcite , _",

    "such sm time traces are called to have a dynamic disorder @xcite .",
    "while the most interesting and physically relevant question to ask about the heterogeneity in single molecule time traces is its molecular origin , detection and quantification of such heterogeneity should precede such question for a further analysis . for sm time",
    "traces with quenched disorder , it is relatively straightforward to analyze as one can use the criterion of ergodicity and partition each time trace into its dynamic subensembles @xcite .",
    "it is , however , more challenging to analyze time traces with dynamic disorder .    in the ion - channel community ,",
    "ion currents across a single ion - channel measured with patch - clamp technique often demonstrate time series that switch between multiple dynamic patterns , and such a phenomenon is called ` mode - switching ' @xcite or ` modal gating ' @xcite .",
    "an algorithm ( aggregated markov model , amm ) developed by ion - channel community to analyze time series exhibiting dynamics disorder is in principle of use , but when applied to our synthetic data , we found that the algorithm tends to overpredict the transitions between hidden states ( see fig .",

    "to assess the efficacy of vb - dcmm in identifying dynamic disorder ( hidden internal state ) of a given time trace , we divided an ensemble of heterogeneous time traces into shorter homogeneous traces by using the information of internal states in @xmath499 , and calculated the distribution of @xmath500 of dwell times , where the subscript 20 means that 20 consecutive data of dwell times along the time traces are used in evaluating the standard deviation ( @xmath501 ) and the mean ( @xmath502 ) .",

    "this approach is not applicable when solid knowledge on internal states is not available .",
    "also , they have used constant value for all prior parameters without investigating the effect of prior parameters on the analysis .",
    "furthermore , unlike vb - dcmm , mcmc method does not offer analytical expression for the evidence , which makes it difficult to select prior parameters ( or to incorporate prior information ) .",
    "there has been a study developing a method that can detect the presence of hidden states by analyzing the dynamic pattern of single ion channel data using ( sticky ) infinite aggregated markov model ( iamm ) with nonparametric bayesian method @xcite .",
    "vb - dcmm differs from iamm in several ways and sometimes can be more advantageous : ( 1 ) iamm uses markov chain monte carlo method whereas vb - dcmm employs the variational bayes method which is computationally less expensive .",
    "( 2 ) in iamm , the aggregated markov model ( amm ) is the basic structure in which only a single markov chain exists .",
    "the model aims to detect distinct transition rates from a signal layer of signal .",
    "in fact , one can map dcmm onto the structure of amm by _ flattening _ the two layers of states in dcmm ( internal and observable states ) into a sequence of one state .",
    "for example , a data structure of dcmm retaining two internal states @xmath519 and two observables @xmath520 can be mapped onto four states in amm as follows : @xmath521 , and @xmath522 ( fig . [ fig_r_iamm]a ) . while the transition between two dynamic patterns in dcmm are more strictly regulated , so that the transition rates @xmath523 , and @xmath524 are practically zero as the transitions of observables are slaved to the internal state , amm does not impose such condition .",
    "although amm could be more flexible in accommodating possible transitions , and could accurately predict the sequence of internal states under very carefully selected the prior parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_r_iamm]c ) , we found that the results obtained from iamm analysis against our synthetic data was highly sensitive to the prior parameters being selected ( fig.[fig_r_iamm]d ) , and that in the most of prior parameters , the traces predicted by iamm ( @xmath525 ) , predicting unwanted frequent transitions between the states , do not match with the synthetic data ( @xmath526 ) , which gives rise to a low @xmath112 value ( @xmath527 ) .",
