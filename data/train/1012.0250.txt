    "the radiation doses to personnel from ionization are usually computed from simulations since measurements are not available at all times , altitudes and locations on the earth . to assess the accuracy of the simulations we report in this paper comparisons of the measurements of cosmic ray fluxes and ionization rates with the results of the simulations .",
    "a long time series of measurements of particle fluxes in the atmosphere at different altitudes has been undertaken by the lebedev physical institute ( lpi ) ( stozhkov et al .",
    "these span the time from 1957 to the present in the regions of moscow , murmansk and mirny ( antarctica ) .",
    "there are also measurements at several other locations on the globe for shorter time spans .",
    "the sparmo collaboration has presented measurements of particle fluxes at different altitudes at four locations on the earth in 1964 ( feiter 1972 ) .",
    "measurements of the ionization rates from ion chambers have been presented by by neher ( neher 1967 ) and by lowder et al .",
    "( lowder et al . 1972 ) .",
    "the simulations used are from obrien ( obrien 2005 ) , from usoskin - kovaltsov ( u - k ) ( usoskin and kovaltsov 2006 ) , from berne ( desorgher et al . 2005 ) and from lpi ( bazilevskaya et al .",
    "the u - k simulations are based on the corsika package and have been extended for the upper atmosphere ( usoskin et al 2010 ) .",
    "the older u - k version has been used here .",
    "the simulations from berne and lpi are based on the geant 4 package .",
    "both the geant 4 and corsika simulations use monte carlo techniques .",
    "the obrien simulations are analytic , based on solutions of the diffusion equation .",
    "comparison of the different measurements at similar cut - off rigidity and similar times shows compatibility mostly within 10% accuracy between the lpi and the sparmo data rising to 20% at one location .",
    "comparison of the simulations shows compatibility to within 10% over most of the range rising to a 20% discrepancy between the u - k and obrien simulations at the highest altitudes ( atmospheric depths @xmath3 50 g/@xmath4 ) .",
    "some experiments measure omnidirectional particle fluxes whereas others measure total ionization rates .",
    "the lpi and sparmo measured the former whilst neher and lowder et al . measured the latter ( lowder et al . also included some flux measurements ) .",

    "the omnidirectional flux , @xmath5 particles per @xmath4 per second , and total ionization , @xmath6 ion pairs per @xmath7 per second , are related by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the average stopping power of all the secondary particles produced by the cosmic ray primary and @xmath10=35ev is the mean energy to produce each ion pair ( porter et al . 1976 ) .",

    "the simulations indicate that the ratio should be constant , but with a rapid increase at very high altitude .",
    "such an effect was observed and reported in stozhkov et al . 2009 . if all the particles in the shower ionized at the rate of 2 mev per gm @xmath12 , the minimum of the ionization curve , the ratio should be constant at 74 @xmath13 .",

    "the discrepancy at highest depth could be due to radioactivity from ground based sources .",

    "this had a wall thickness of 1.1  g/@xmath4 of steel .",
    "protons of energy less than 30  mev and electrons of energy less than a few mev can not penetrate such a wall thickness .",
    "the lpi data were taken with detectors of wall thickness 0.05  g/@xmath4 of steel with thresholds of @xmath140.2  mev for electrons and 5  mev for protons .",
    "the background noise in the lpi data is less than 10% of the signal at sea level , so this can not account for the discrepancy .",
    "the lower energy threshold of the lpi detectors compared to the lowder ion chamber implies that the discrepancy at low altitude is caused by low energy particles .",
    "a contribution to the low values of the ratio @xmath11 near sea level , shown in figure 1 , could also come from such low energy particles .",

    "the 11-year solar modulation is visible at all altitudes in both the measurements and the simulations with an amplitude which increases with altitude .",

    "the times of minimum count rate were 1958.8 , 1969.3 , 1982.5 , 1990.5 and 2001.3 and those of maximum count rate were 1965.0 , 1976.6 , 1986.9 , 1996.8 and 2006.5 .",
    "these dates occur slightly later than the corresponding sun spot number peaks due to the well known delay in the response of the cosmic rays .",
    "the data and simulations were then each averaged for @xmath00.5 years on each side of these times .",
    "the modulation fraction , @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 where max and min are the maximum and minimum count rates averaged in this way .",
    "the modulation fraction was then computed at each altitude in the same way for both the simulation and the measurements .",
    "figure 5 shows the resulting modulation fractions , @xmath15 , as a function of altitude from the measured data and from the obrien flux simulation .",
    "we also show the modulation of the ionization rate from the u - k simulation .",
    "it can be seen that the obrien simulation follows the solar modulation reasonably well whereas the u - k simulation predicts a larger modulation than that observed .",
    "this discrepancy arises as follows .",
    "the measured lpi data at solar maximum agree well with the flux computed from the u - k simulation assuming a constant value of @xmath11=90  @xmath13 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for depths between 100 - 600 g/@xmath4 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however , at solar minimum the u - k simulation predicts a larger flux than that observed , giving too large values of @xmath15 .",
    "the discrepancy at solar minimum could be related to the fact that the modulation potential derived from neutron monitor data may overestimate the flux of low energy particles below the neutron monitor threshold that may become more noticeable around solar minima ( usoskin 2010a ) .",
    "the measured fractional solar modulation at an altitude of 900 g/@xmath4 averaged over the 3 locations is 6.5@xmath01.7 % .",
    "this agrees well with the value deduced by sloan and wolfendale  ( 2008 ) .",
    "the value is smaller than the solar modulation fraction for neutron monitors at a similar latitude of 15 - 20% but larger than that for muons .",
    "the mean value of this fraction for muons from shielded ion chamber data at a similar value of cut - off rigidity was found to be 2.4@xmath00.3% ( ahluwalia 1997 ) .",
    "hence the measured solar modulation for all charged particle fluxes is a factor 2.7@xmath00.8 greater than the value for muons alone .",
    "the obrien simulation predicts that 72% of the flux of cosmic ray particles at this level are muons .",
    "hence the solar modulation of the flux from the remaining particles ( the soft component of cosmic rays ) must be larger than that for muons and closer to that seen from neutron monitors .",
    "the data from the sparmo collaboration at various places with different cut - off rigidity , r@xmath17 , are shown in figure 6 .",
    "these data were taken at various times in 1964 during solar minimum activity .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show the predictions of the u - k and obrien simulations averaged throughout 1964 , respectively . to obtain a flux value , the u - k ionization simulations",
    "have been adjusted assuming a constant @xmath11 ratio of 90 @xmath13 , taken from the data in figure  1 .",
    "figure 7 shows the ratios of the measured data to the simulations .",
    "the simulations represent the trend of the data . however , there are significant differences with the obrien simulations at cut - off rigidities above 4.6 gv .    , as measured by the sparmo collaboration compared with the u - k and obrien simulations . , width=340 ]    , shown in figure 6 to the u - k and obrien simulations . ,",
    "width=340 ]      the measured data and the simulations were smoothed over the solar cycle using an averaging interval of @xmath1411 years .",
    "the interval was corrected at different times for the differing solar cycle lengths following the procedure described by lockwood and frhlich ( 2007 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the results .",
    "the simulations show qualitatively similar behaviour to the measured data with a possible 22-year cycle being present in each .",
    "the measured data show a tendency to increase after the year 2000 , perhaps reflecting the rather quiet solar behaviour of recent years .",
    "the simulations and the measured data are in general agreement with each other .",
    "there are discrepancies with the measured data at low altitude where radioactivity from ground based sources may be expected to contribute .",
    "however , the disagreements at this altitude persist in antarctica where the contribution from radioactivity would be expected to be low .",
    "perhaps this indicates a contribution from long - lived atmospheric radioactivity produced by cosmic rays .",
    "there are also some discrepancies at very high altitude .",
    "the u - k simulation predicts a solar modulation which is larger than expected in the data whereas the obrien simulation represents the data well",
    ". other discrepancies also occur at cut - off rigidities above 4.6 gv .",
    "the measurements show that the fractional solar modulation of the ionization and the flux is a factor 2.7@xmath00.8 greater than that observed for muons near sea level , obtained from shielded ion chamber measurements .",
