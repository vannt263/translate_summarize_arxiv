    "detecting redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen ( hi ) at high redshifts is of considerable interest in cosmology . at redshifts @xmath29 ,",
    "the bulk of the neutral gas is in clouds that have hi column densities in excess of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "these high column density clouds are observed as damped lyman-@xmath31 absorption lines seen in quasar spectra .",
    "the analysis of quasar spectra indicate that the ratio of the density @xmath32 of neutral gas to the present critical density @xmath33 of the universe has a nearly constant value @xmath34 , over a large redshift range @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the redshifted @xmath36 radiation from the hi in this redshift range will be seen in emission .",
    "the emission from individual clouds ( @xmath37 ) is too weak to be detected with existing instruments unless the image is significantly magnified by gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the collective emission from the undetected clouds is present as a very faint background in all radio observations at frequencies below @xmath38 .",
    "the fluctuations in this background radiation carry an imprint of the hi distribution at the redshift @xmath39 where the radiation originated . the possibility of detecting this holds the potential of providing us with a new observational probe of large - scale structures @xcite . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite report a detection of the post - reionization hi signal through the cross - correlation between the hipass and the 6dfgrs data .",
    "observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation can in principle be carried out over a large redshift range starting from the cosmological dark ages through the epoch of reionization to the present epoch @xcite , allowing us to trace out both the evolution history of neutral hydrogen as well as the growth of structures in the universe . redshifted",
    "21-cm observations also hold the potential of allowing us to probe the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the giant meter wave radio telescope ( gmrt ; @xcite ) , currently operating at several frequency bands in the frequency range @xmath40 to @xmath41 is well suited for carrying out observations towards detecting the hi signal over a large redshift range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and angular scales of @xmath44 to @xmath45 . in this paper",
    "we report results from the analysis of @xmath46 observations towards detecting the redshifted 21-cm signal from the cosmological hi distribution at @xmath47 .",
    "we have characterized , possibly for the first time , the statistical properties of the background radiation at @xmath48 across @xmath4 to @xmath5 angular scales and a frequency bandwidth of @xmath6 with a resolution of @xmath49 using the multi - frequency angular power spectrum @xmath3 ( hereafter maps ; @xcite ) .",
    "this jointly characterizes the angular ( @xmath13 ) and frequency ( @xmath11 ) dependence of the fluctuations in the @xmath46 radiation in the field of view of our observation .",
    "foregrounds from different astrophysical sources are expected to be a few orders of magnitude larger than the predicted 21-cm signal @xcite and our @xmath46 gmrt observations are expected to be nearly entirely dominated by foregrounds which are predicted to be at least a thousand times larger than the hi signal . separating the hi signal from foregrounds is the most important challenge for cosmological redshifted 21-cm observations .",
    "the foregrounds are believed to have a smooth continuum spectra and the contribution to @xmath3 is expected to vary very slowly with @xmath11 across the band @xmath50 of our analysis .",
    "the contribution from the hi signal decorrelates very rapidly with increasing @xmath11 and is expected to be uncorrelated beyond @xmath51 at the angular scales ( @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) of our analysis .",
    "this property of the signal holds the promise of allowing us to separate the signal from the foregrounds . in this paper",
    "we propose and implement a technique that uses polynomial fitting in @xmath11 to subtract out any smoothly varying component from the measured @xmath3 .",
    "the residuals are expected to contain only the hi signal and noise .",
    "the target of the present work is to test if the polynomial subtraction successfully removes the foregrounds to a level such that the residuals are consistent with noise .",
    "the noise in the current observation is considerably larger than the hi - signal and longer observations would be needed for detecting the hi signal .",
    "the present work closely follows an earlier paper @xcite which analyzed @xmath54 gmrt observations .",
    "we note that the prospect of detecting the redshifted 21-cm signal considerably increases at higher frequencies ( eg .",
    "@xmath46 ) where the foreground contribution and noise are both smaller .",
    "further , the problem of man made radio frequency interference is considerably more severe at @xmath54 as compared to @xmath46 .    a brief outline of the paper follows .",
    "section @xmath55 describes the observation and data analysis , section @xmath56 presents the visibility correlation technique that we use to estimate @xmath3 and also presents the estimated values , sections @xmath57 and @xmath58 present model predictions for the hi signal and foregrounds respectively , while section @xmath59 describes our proposed technique of foreground removal and finally section @xmath60 contains results and conclusions .",

    "@xmath63 of which are randomly distributed in a central square @xmath64 in extent , while the rest of the antennas are distributed approximately in a y shaped configuration .",
    "the shortest antenna separation ( baseline ) is around @xmath65 including projection effects while the largest separation can be as long as @xmath66 .",
    "the hybrid configuration of the gmrt gives reasonably good sensitivity to probe both compact and extended sources .",

    "the observations were carried out over three days from @xmath71 to @xmath72 september , @xmath73 and the total observation time was almost 30 hours ( including calibration ) .",
    "the observation had a center frequency of @xmath74 , and a total band - width of @xmath75 divided into @xmath76 frequency channels , each @xmath77 wide .",
    "the integration time was 16 seconds and visibilities were recorded for two orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "the calibrator source 3c147 and 3c286 were used for flux calibration and 1313 + 675 was used for phase calibration .",
    "the phase calibrator was observed every half hour to correct for temporal variations in the system gain .",
    "we have used the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) to analyze the recorded visibility data .",
    "the flux of these two flux calibrator was estimated by extending the baars scale ( @xcite ) to low frequencies using the aips task setjy. standard aips tasks were used to flag all data that could be visually identified as being bad .",
    "the entire lower sideband data was found to be bad and was discarded from the subsequent analysis .",
    "data from different days were calibrated and flagged separately and then combined using the aips task dbcon. we find that the channels near the edge of the band are relatively noisy and hence only the 100 central channels were used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "an initial 2d image of the field of view ( fov ) showed four bright sources with considerable imaging artifacts . to improve our image quality ,",
    "initially we have subtracted out the clean components ( cc ) of these bright sources by moving them to the phase center using appropriate ra - shift and dec - shift within aips . then",
    ", we add back the brightest source and use this for three rounds of self - calibration with time intervals of 3 and 2 minutes for phase calibration and finally 20 minutes for amplitude and phase calibration and then subtract out the brightest source again .",
    "the same process is followed for rest of the bright sources .",
    "subsequent to this , we have also subtracted out all the weaker sources from our fov and used the aips task tvflg to flag out any bad visibility . finally , we have collapsed all frequency channels and clipped the resulting visibilities at @xmath78 . at each stage the same calibration and flag tables were also applied to the original 100 channel data which contains all the sources .",
    "the large field of view ( @xmath79 ) of the gmrt at 610 mhz leads to considerable errors if the non - planar nature of the gmrt antenna distribution is not taken into account .",
    "we use the three dimensional ( 3d ) imaging feature @xcite in the aips task imagr in which the entire field of view is divided into multiple sub - fields , each of which is imaged separately . here , a @xmath80 fov was imaged using 163 facets .",
    "the presence of a large number of sources in the field allows us to do self calibration loops to improve the image quality .",
    "we have applied 4 rounds of self calibration , the first three only for the phase and the final round for both amplitude and phase .",
    "the time interval for the gain correction was chosen as @xmath81 and @xmath82 minutes for the successive self calibration loops . at every stage",
    "the calibration tables were applied to the original 100 channel data .",
    "the 100 channels were collapsed into 10 channels which were used to make a continuum image of the entire fov .",

    "removing the foregrounds which , as we have seen , are several orders of magnitude larger than the hi signal is possibly the biggest challenge for detecting the hi signal .",
    "there have been quite a few earlier works on this , nearly all either theoretical or simulation .",
    "all attempts in this direction are based on the assumption that the foregrounds are continuum radiation which vary slowly with frequency whereas the hi is a line emission which varies rapidly with frequency .",
    "a possible line of approach is to represent the sky signal as an image cube where in addition to the two angular coordinates on the sky we have the frequency as the third dimension .",
    "for each angular position , polynomial fitting is used to subtract out the component of the sky signal that varies slowly with frequency .",
    "the residual sky signal is expected to contain only the hi signal and noise @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that this method of foreground removal has problems which could be particularly severe at large baselines if the @xmath165 sampling is sparse .",
    "they propose an alternate method where the frequency dependence of the visibility data is fitted with a polynomial and this is used to subtract out the slowly varying component .",
    "the residuals are expected to contain only noise and the hi signal .    in this work",

    "we find that this method fails to remove the point sources efficiently , several imaging artifacts remain in the vicinity of bright sources even after the sources have been removed .",
    "similar findings were reported in @xcite where the same technique was used to remove point sources from @xmath257 gmrt observations . given the poor performance of this image based technique , we have not pursued it any further .",
    "the visibility based technique proposed by @xcite requires the data to be gridded in @xmath165 plane .",
    "the estimator that we have used to determine @xmath3 ( section [ sec3 ] ) works with the individual visibilities . using the gridded data would introduce a positive noise bias in @xmath3 and hence we do not adopt this technique here .",

    "we propose a different method where the foregrounds are subtracted _ after _ determining the angular power spectrum .",

    "we assume that @xmath3 measured in the frequency interval @xmath261 contains only foreground and noise .",
    "further , we assume that the foreground contribution to @xmath3 has a slow @xmath11 dependence which can be well fitted by a low order polynomial .",
