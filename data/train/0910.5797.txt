    "the nature of multipartite quantum entanglement is often manifested in quantum interference experiments .",
    "for example , in the case of entangled photon states generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , quantum interference is observed in coincidence counts between two detectors , each individually exhibiting no interference fringes @xcite .",
    "one notable example of photonic quantum interference is the photonic de broglie wave in which an ensemble of @xmath0 identical photons with wavelength @xmath1 exhibits @xmath2 interference fringes @xcite .",
    "the photonic de broglie wavelength @xmath2 can be observed at the @xmath0-photon detector placed at an output port of an interferometer if the beam splitters that make up the interferometer do not randomly split @xmath0 photons .",
    "the quantum state of the photons in the interferometer is then the photon number - path entangled state or the noon state @xmath3 where the subscripts refer to the two interferometric paths .",

    "@xcite , with each detector placed at an output port of a multi - path interferometer , is a classical effect since the coincidence modulation is a direct result of modulations ( with different phases ) observed at individual detectors .",
    "also , classical thermal light may exhibit sub - wavelength interference fringes in coincidences but at the reduced visibility consistent with classical states @xcite .",
    "thus , the reduced - period fringe itself need not be of quantum origin .",
    "it is , however , important to point out that @xmath0-th order quantum interference , such as quantum optical @xmath2 modulations due to the photonic de broglie wave , must exhibit high visibility ( up to 100% in principle ) in the absence of any lower - order interference .    in this paper , we report an intriguing new observation of @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) photonic de broglie wave interference that has no classical interpretation and is not associated with the noon state .",
    "we also show theoretically that photonic de broglie waves can even be observed for a pair of photons that are completely separable ( i.e. , no entanglement in all degrees of freedom ) and distinguishable .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results suggest that the photonic de broglie wave is , in fact , not related to the entanglement of the photons , rather it reflects the characteristics ( i.e. , the indistinguishable pathways ) of the measurement scheme .",
