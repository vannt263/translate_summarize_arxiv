    "techniques from physics , information theory , and computer science are employed to develop robust quantum processors .",
    "the development of quantum error correction was a critical result for quantum computing in general , because it showed that arbitrarily complex computations could be executed on hardware with nonzero error rate  @xcite .",
    "however , optimism was tempered by the realization that the _ resource overhead _ ( the redundancy in hardware that enables error correction ) could be several orders of magnitude larger than a noise - free circuit for plausible error rates and interesting quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "current hardware designs can control fewer than ten quantum bits  @xcite , so the million - qubit devices that implement fault - tolerant computation must be several technology generations away from the current state of the art . to bridge the gap , research in fault - tolerant quantum computing",
    "focuses on developing methods to reduce the overhead and to perform reliable quantum computing on hardware that is simpler to design and fabricate .",
    "this work addresses the most resource - intensive component in most , if not all , quantum computations .",
    "an important result from quantum error correction is that , in any quantum code , there always exists one crucial operation that is not natively available  @xcite , and hence it is expensive to prepare .",
    "a commonly selected operation is the toffoli gate  @xcite , defined by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are binary variables and operation @xmath6 is binary xor .",
    "this paper introduces a fault - tolerant construction for the toffoli gate which can substantially lower the resource overhead in fault - tolerant quantum computing .",
    "the two - round error detection in this paper is an improvement over the one - round error detection in refs .",
    "@xcite . by incorporating this construction into recent analyses of fault - tolerant quantum architectures  @xcite",
    ", we anticipate that the resource costs determined therein could be reduced by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ preliminaries_section ] outlines some notation and preliminary assumptions .",

    "section  [ discussion_section ] discusses the impact of these results on fault - tolerant quantum computing .",
    "an important distinction in this paper is made between quantum gates that are `` easy '' and `` hard . ''",
    "an operation is easy when it has a direct and low - overhead implementation within a chosen error - correcting code .",
    "traditionally , these operations were labeled `` transversal , '' because they could be applied element - wise to a code block or in matching pairs element - wise between two code blocks , which ensured fault tolerance  @xcite .",
    "however , modern codes like surface codes  @xcite do not actually use transversal gates .",
    "still , the distinction is important because some operations are hard , meaning they require substantially more overhead to perform .",
    "often , the hard operations invoke many easy operations to perform some distillation procedure  @xcite .    in the important family of css codes",
    "@xcite , as well as many more stabilizer codes  @xcite , the easy operations are clifford gates .",
    "the group of clifford gates includes the pauli operators @xmath7 , _",
    "etc._. the group is generated by the phase gate @xmath8 $ ] , hadamard @xmath9 , and cnot .",
    "for convenience , we will also consider initialization and measurement in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bases to be easy operations , so we may say they are `` clifford '' although they are not unitary .    by contrast ,",
    "non - clifford gates tend to be much more difficult .",
    "references  @xcite show that there is always one operation required for universal quantum computing that is not transversal in a given code . in the surface code",
    "@xcite , only a subset of the clifford group is natively available , while the rest must be `` injected '' into the code space .",
    "injection is not a fault - tolerant process , so the injected states must be purified of errors , which is costly .",
    "distilling the non - clifford operation @xmath12 $ ] requires about @xmath13 the circuit resources as a fault - tolerant cnot  @xcite .",
    "this disparity motivates our efforts to find a more efficient non - clifford operation in the form of toffoli gates .",
    "the high cost of fault - tolerant non - clifford gates ( compared to clifford gates ) is the justification for another assumption , that only errors in the non - clifford @xmath1  gates are considered .",
    "this paper derives quantum circuits in a way that is well - suited to surface code error correction .",
    "the features of the surface code make some logical code operations more convenient than others .",
    "in particular , only cnot , hadamard , and @xmath10- and @xmath11-basis initialization and measurement are natively available  @xcite .",
    "we later demonstrate an ancilla - aided @xmath14-basis measurement .",
    "rotations by angles @xmath15 or @xmath16 about the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes on the bloch sphere are possible but more costly , as they require magic - state distillation .",
    "we assume that the non - clifford @xmath1  gate ( rotation by @xmath16 around the @xmath11 axis ) is available to produce logical toffoli gates with error detection .",

    "[ composite_ccz_logical ] and to assume that the appropriate hadamard gates are inserted when this gate is used in an algorithm .",

    "all implementations are generated by stabilizers @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where subscript on each pauli operator denotes one of the four qubits in the code .",
    "however , logical operators can be chosen in multiple distinct ways , and this choice determines encoding / decoding circuits and the set of transversal gates .",
    "we will label our first implementation the `` @xmath10/@xmath14 encoding '' because the logical @xmath10 and @xmath14 operators on both encoded qubits are weight-2 ; they can be written as : @xmath30 where the bar in @xmath31 distinguishes logical code operators from physical qubit operators , and subscript corresponds to one of the two encoded qubits .",
    "importantly , @xmath10/@xmath14 encoding does not yield a code where transversal cnot implements encoded cnot .",
    "the second implementation we use is the standard @xmath10/@xmath11 encoding  @xcite : @xmath32 the @xmath10/@xmath11 encoding does permit transversal cnot , and conversion between encodings will be necessary to satisfy our aim of using only @xmath10- and @xmath11-axis rotations .",
