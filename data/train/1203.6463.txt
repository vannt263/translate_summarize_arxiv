    "the watson - crick double - stranded form represents the thermodynamically stable state of dna in a wide range of temperature and salt conditions .",
    "however , even at standard physiologic conditions , there always exists possibility that the double - helix is locally unzipped into two strands both at its ends and in its interior @xcite .",
    "if the interior unzipping is neglected , the unfolding of the two strands can be described by a simple zipper model @xcite .",
    "this model , while including several simplifications , emphasizes the essential ingredient of the unzipping process , that means the competition between the entropic forces which tend to open the macromolecule , and the energetic forces that tend to condense it into its double - stranded form .    in the last two decades",
    ", new experimental techniques have been developed for detailed analysis of unzipping processes .",
    "a powerful technique are single molecule manipulations by optical tweezers @xcite , where biomolecules are unfolded and refolded by applying mechanical forces .",
    "because single molecules are subject to strong fluctuations , a stochastic description of the unfolding / refolding kinetics becomes necessary .",
    "investigation of these stochastic processes can be useful to understand how biomolecules unfold and fold under locally applied forces @xcite , as , for example , when mrna passes through the ribosome during the translation process @xcite , or when dna is unzipped by helicase during the replication process @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting part in the analysis of unzipping processes is the application of integral or detailed fluctuation theorems @xcite to estimate free energy differences between folded and unfolded states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "their advantage is that they can be applied also to protocols , which drive the considered system far from equilibrium .",
    "it is thus not necessary to perform the unfolding / folding under quasi - static near - equilibrium conditions , where the process becomes reversible .",
    "most popular theorems are the crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite and jarzynski equality @xcite .",
    "these relate to the distribution of work performed on the molecule during the process .",
    "unfortunately it is not easy to get theoretical insight into characteristics of the underlying work distributions in far - from - equilibrium processes , since the work is a functional of the whole stochastic trajectory .",
    "investigations have been conducted for simple spin systems driven by a time - dependent external field @xcite and for diffusion processes in the presence of a time - dependent potential @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions are known for two - state systems @xcite and for systems with one continuous state variable @xcite .    in this study we present analytical results for the work distribution for a multi - state system , which is motivated by a model proposed by kittel for describing the melting transition of dna molecules @xcite . in order to derive analytical results",
    ", we had to consider a stochastic process with directed forwarded and forbidden backward transitions between states .",
    "as a consequence , detailed balance is broken and fluctuation theorems , as mentioned above , will not hold true . on the other hand , kinetic monte carlo simulations of the stochastic process",
    "show that , for at least certain parameter settings in the model , the restriction of forbidden backward transitions is not so severe and events dominating the integrand in the jarzynski equality are not very rare .",
    "it is important to point out that these parameter settings are not related to any experimental conditions . in more realistic settings rare events",
    "would play the decisive role and in such cases it becomes difficult to determine tails of the work distribution with sufficient accuracy .",
    "also the relation of the work considered in our study to the thermodynamic work measured in an unzipping experiments needs to be treated with care .",
    "these problems are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and they imply that the theory can not be applied to experiments at this stage .",
    "our findings should nevertheless be useful because connection to experiments seems not completely out of reach and because they widen the range of hopping models , where analytical results for work distributions are available .",
    "kittel s model @xcite is a simplified version of the poland - scheraga model @xcite for the equilibrium properties of dna molecules , which got renewed attention in the last ten years @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the poland - scheraga model , it disregards the possibility of any interior openings ( bubbles ) of double - stranded parts of the molecule . despite this simplification ,",
    "it is already sufficient to understand the origin of a melting transition .",
    "a molecule in kittel s model @xcite has @xmath0 links in its fully folded state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "different states @xmath4 of the molecule refer to configurations , where @xmath5 of the links are opened in a row .",
    "the difference @xmath6 of the internal energy of a state with @xmath5 open links and the ground state @xmath7 ( no open links ) is equal to @xmath8 , corresponding to a loss of chemical bond energy @xmath9 per broken link . with each broken link , the molecule gains @xmath10 degrees of freedom , which characterize the win of conformational degrees of freedom when double - stranded dna is transferred to single stranded dna .",
    "the entropy difference @xmath11 between the state @xmath2 and the ground state then becomes @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the free energy @xmath14 of state @xmath2 at a temperature @xmath15 is thus given by @xmath16 $ ] and the equilibrium properties can be readily worked out by considering the partition sum @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .        in extending this model to treat unfolding kinetics",
    ", the molecule is supposed to unzip successively , one link in each step , as a consequence of a strong external driving .",
    "such external driving can be caused by a local force or a ph gradient , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . with respect to pulling experiments on single dna molecules out of equilibrium",
    ", there is evidence that a neglect of interior openings can become even less relevant than for the equilibrium properties .",
    "for example , far away from the melting temperature , e.g.  at standard room temperature conditions ( 298  k ) , the unfolding kinetics of dna hairpin molecules could be successfully described by assuming no interior openings and thermally activated unzipping transitions @xcite . moreover ,",
    "molecular fraying can be identified in individual unzipping trajectories by considering the size of force jumps .",
    "thereby states with interior openings can be systematically excluded from the analysis @xcite .",
    "we assume that the driving lowers the energy differences by an amount proportional to @xmath19 , i.e.  open states with a larger number of broken links are favored with increasing time .",

    "this reflects the fact that it is difficult for the flexible unfolded part of the molecule to find proper configurations , which would allow for a reformation of ( hydrogen ) bonds .    if the model would refer to the hopping motion of a particle between time - dependent energy levels @xmath44 , the work performed on the system ( for one realization of the stochastic process )",
