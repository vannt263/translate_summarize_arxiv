    "the kuiper belt is a disk of icy bodies having semi - major axes larger than that of neptune .",
    "its members are usually known as kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) or trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) .",
    "the distribution of their orbits is structured leading to the identification of several dynamical families .",
    "resonant kbos are those which are trapped in mean - motion resonances with neptune ( those trapped in the 3:2 resonance are also known as plutinos ) . scattered kbos , also known as scattered disk objects , are essentially highly eccentric kbos under strong gravitational influence of neptune .",
    "classical kbos ( ckbos ) possess relatively circular orbits that are neither located in any strong mean - motion resonance with neptune nor strongly subject to its gravitational influence .    since their discovery in 1992",
    "more than 1200 kbos have been identified . due to their faintness",
    "only about 50 can be spectroscopically studied with the currently available instruments .",
    "multicolor photometry provides , however , a first - order approximation of their spectra , hence of their surface composition .",
    "most kbos can be studied photometrically and about 230 objects have at least one measured color .",
    "their surface colors have shown to be most diverse , ranging from neutral and even slightly blue ( relative to the sun ) to extremely red , suggesting a large compositional diversity ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the color diversity remains unclear .",
    "various suggestions have been made in the context of collisional resurfacing @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , none of the proposed models has been able to consistently explain the colors @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the observed color differences reflect primordial compositional variations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such compositional differences would be hard to explain if kbos formed _ in situ _ , since the temperature difference between 30 and 50 au is a very modest @xmath7 k. however , larger temperature and compositional differences might be possible if the kbo population , or part of it , did not form in place .",
    "some dynamical models , in fact , suggest outward migration of kbos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . although there are no detailed chemical studies to address how varied such compositions would be and how these would reflect in the surface colors , these dynamical models imply a link between the current orbital inclinations of classical kbos and their presumed location of origin",
    ".    as a whole , kbos do not show significant correlations between their colors and orbital parameters such as semi - major axis or perihelion distance . on the other hand , the ckbos do show a correlation between orbital inclination and optical color @xcite and a correlation between perihelion and color @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "several works have pointed out the existence of two groups of ckbos with a separation at @xmath4 in inclination .",
    "the two groups , usually referred to as `` cold '' ( @xmath8 ) and `` hot '' ( @xmath9 ) , have been identified using not only orbital properties @xcite but also physical properties such as size and binarity @xcite .",
    "given its potential importance , we re - examine the color - inclination relation using a new data set and appropriate statistical tests .",
    "we use the system of @xcite to select ckbos for our sample .",
    "these authors classify the kbo families based on 4 gyr dynamical simulations .",
    "the classical kbos have semi - major axes in the range @xmath10 au and perihelion distances @xmath11 au , and must not be not located in any strong resonance ( 3:2 , 5:3 , 7:4 , and 2:1 ) .",
    "all orbital elements were gathered from the minor planet center .",
    "we have computed the orbital inclinations relative to the kuiper belt plane ( kbp ) , hereafter denoted by @xmath12 , as defined by @xcite .",
    "we conducted our statistical tests using both the raw inclinations and @xmath12 , finding no significant difference between them . in the remainder of this work , we present all results in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "for our data set we have gathered all the @xmath13 colors of ckbos available in the literature or online .",
    "several objects have colors reported in more than one work but the different measurements have been shown to be essentially compatible .",
    "hence we chose to take the ckbo colors sequentially from the works that have been presenting lower and less dispersed error bars to those with ( slightly ) larger and more dispersed error bars .",
    "therefore , firstly we gathered the ckbo colors from tegler , romanishin and consolmagno s data sampletegler / research / survey.htm ] ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; secondly those from the  eso large program on centaurs and tnos \" ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; thirdly those from the  meudon multicolor survey ( 2ms ) \" ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; fourthly those from @xcite ; and lastly those from the online @xcite mboss databaseohainaut / mboss/ ] .",
    "the resulting ckbo sample used here has colors in the range @xmath14 . for reference ,",
    "the color of the sun is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a histogram of the @xmath13 error bars of the gathered ckbos shows a rather continuous but very skewed distribution , from 0.01 up to 0.21 peaking around 0.06 and with a mean value of 0.09 .",
    "six wayward objects possess errors between 0.28 and 0.40 , though , and we chose to eliminate them .",
    "the subsequent data consist of the @xmath13 colors of 71 ckbos ( see table [ data.tab ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the next section , two data points appear to be outliers : 2001qy@xmath16 and 1998wv@xmath17 .",
    "we chose to discard both and the final data set under analysis consists of the @xmath13 colors of 69 ckbos .",
    "the effects of keeping these two wayward objects in the sample are discussed in section [ checking : sec ] .",
    "a visual inspection of the @xmath13 colors of ckbos versus @xmath12 in our data set instantly shows a trend between these two variables ( see fig .  [ plot_ik_br.fig ] ) . using the statistical tools implemented in idl we have analyzed this trend quantitatively .",
    "the spearman - rank correlation coefficient , @xmath18 , for the total of n=69 ckbos @xcite is :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the significance level in standard deviations of a gaussian probability distribution  error bars are estimated from 1000 bootstrap extractions corrected for non - gaussian behavior @xcite .",
    "this is a highly significant correlation consistent with the published values .",
    "the square of the correlation coefficient , usually called the `` coefficient of determination '' , gives approximately the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that can be predicted by the changes in the values of the independent variable .",
    "so , from @xmath21 we may say that about half of the color variability can be accounted for by differences in orbital inclination .",
    "the other half is color variability unaccounted for by inclination differences and presumably related to some other undetermined variable or effect .    fig .",
    "[ plot_ik_br.fig ] suggests that the color - inclination trend might be not linear : the colors of low inclination objects do not seem to correlate with inclination . when dividing the data set in two groups in inclination with equal number of objects we have a low inclination group with 34 objects ( @xmath22 ) and a high inclination group with 35 ( @xmath23 ) . while the high inclination group still shows a strong and significant color - inclination correlation : @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , the low inclination one does not show any significant correlation : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ hist_br_ik_stacked.fig ] we have drawn histograms of the @xmath13 colors for the 34 objects with @xmath22 , for the 46 objects with @xmath28 , and for all objects . from this figure",
    "it seems that the color distributions for @xmath22 and @xmath28 are the same while only for @xmath29 do we start to see a significant number of blue objects .",
    "the color differences between two groups of objects may be analyzed using the wilcoxon test @xcite , the non - parametric equivalent of the t - test , also known as wilcoxon rank - sum test .",
    "the test ranks the full set of colors and assesses for incompatibility by comparing the ranks assigned to the members of each group .",
    "comparing the 34 objects with @xmath22 and the 12 objects with @xmath30 shows no evidence for color differences between the two groups ( the significance level of incompatibility is @xmath31 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "comparing the 46 objects with @xmath28 and the 23 objects with @xmath29 shows a color incompatibility at a @xmath32 significance level .",
    "next we study : ( i ) how the correlation coefficient varies with the inclusion of more highly inclined objects , ( ii ) how the mean colors vary with inclination , and ( iii ) which functional form best describes their behavior .      to further investigate the variations of the color - inclination trend we have successively computed @xmath18 for ckbos below a critical inclination cutoff @xmath33 varying from @xmath34 in increments of @xmath35 up to @xmath36 .",
    "these two extrema were imposed so as not to calculate correlation values for very small sub - samples which were already out of the region of interest .",
    "table [ rhos_wilcoxon.tab ] lists the results for each inclination cutoff @xmath33 , both for objects with inclinations below @xmath33 and those above @xmath33  error bars and significance levels are also indicated .",
    "we see that @xmath18 varies rather erratically until @xmath37 , increases systematically with the inclusion of objects above that point , and reaches the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) typical minimum statistical threshold to have `` reasonably strong evidence '' for correlation at @xmath40 .",
    "such behavior suggests the presence of a homogenous set of colors below @xmath41 consistent with fig .",
    "[ hist_br_ik_stacked.fig ] .",
    "while for the 46 ckbos with @xmath42 we have no apparent color - inclination correlation ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , for the 23 objects with @xmath45 a significant correlation is present ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) .",
    "we note that after moving the critical inclination cutoff by just @xmath35 the 21 ckbos with @xmath48 no longer show the canonical @xmath49 level correlation ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , and for the 17 objects with @xmath52 the significance level drops below @xmath38 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , the data provide no formally significant evidence for correlation among objects with @xmath54 .",
    "this first analysis shows that the ckbos of smallest inclination are homogeneous and red , as other works have reported , but that homogeneity extends at least up to @xmath41 , not only up to @xmath55 .",
    "further , the rapid decrease in the correlation found by removing the objects between @xmath56 and @xmath57 may suggest two separate groups of objects , each one having no color - inclination correlation whatsoever , populating two distinct parts of the classical kuiper belt . we will address this possibility further ahead .",
    "we are aware , though , that when considering objects with @xmath58 and @xmath59 separately we are also reducing the inclination spans under analysis , _",
    "i.e. _ , constraining the range of inclination values .",
    "we saw previously that only about half of the color variability can be explained by inclination differences .",
    "consequently , the weakening of correlation values and their significance levels seen when splitting the data set in two inclination groups , could simply be a consequence of using an inclination range too narrow to detect any significant trend .",
    "to investigate this possibility we analyze how the mean colors of ckbos vary with inclination .      evidently , if the sample shows a color - inclination trend the mean colors of ckbos with @xmath58 must be different from those with @xmath59 .",
    "that is , they must be statistically incompatible .",
    "if the trend was approximately linear , evidence for color incompatibility would simply vary smoothly with the number of objects above and below @xmath33 , as it also depends on that number .",
    "however , if there is a homogenous group of colors below some @xmath33 value then a maximum of color incompatibility between objects above and below that @xmath33 is expected to occur .",
    "using the wilcoxon test , we successively compare the mean colors of ckbos having @xmath58 with those having @xmath59 , varying @xmath60 from @xmath34 to @xmath36 in increments of @xmath35 .",
    "results for each @xmath33 are listed in the last column of table [ rhos_wilcoxon.tab ]  the @xmath61 value is the significance level in standard deviations of a gaussian probability distribution .",
    "the mean values are also indicated .",
    "the significance of these differences peaks at @xmath62 , with a value of @xmath32 .",
    "these results corroborate the existence of a homogenous set of colors below @xmath63 , as suggested by the analysis in the previous sections .",
    "the finding of the critical inclination cutoff @xmath37 that separates the red group of ckbos from the more blue ones , carried out in the previous sections , assumes that our data set is a representative sample of the ckbos . as with the correlation",
    "coefficients case , we may use bootstraps to estimate the confidence interval ( error bar ) of the best inclination cutoff @xmath33 obtained from the wilcoxon tests .",
    "we have made 1000 bootstrap extractions from the data set and for each extraction we have looked for the @xmath33 values that maximized the color differences between objects above and below it , as done in the previous section . since in our analysis the @xmath33 is not continuous but discrete ( with @xmath35 steps ) the bootstrap distribution is likely to be jagged .",
    "to avoid jaggedness a gaussian noise with @xmath64 was added to the inclinations of each bootstrap extraction ( smooth bootstrap )",
    ".    the probability density distribution of best critical inclination cutoff @xmath33 for maximum color differences ( from wilcoxon tests ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ hist_boots_w_data.fig ] .",
    "the @xmath33 that maximizes color differences is well centered around @xmath56 . its @xmath65 confidence interval ( @xmath66 percentile )",
    "is @xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "the probability density distribution is not smoothly bell - shaped and two other small solution spikes are also present : @xmath69 probability for @xmath70@xmath71 and @xmath72 probability at @xmath73@xmath74 . however , the associated probabilities of these spikes are low and they do not warrant further attention .      having established that the ckbos with @xmath75 constitute a group of homogeneously red objects , we next examine the variation of @xmath13 at larger inclinations and the apparent stepwise behavior at the edge of the homogeneously red group .",
    "we consider three different functional forms for @xmath13 color as a function of inclination : a ) linear ; b ) two - constant stepwise ; c ) constant - linear stepwise ( see fig .  [ ik_br_fits.fig ] ) .",
    "firstly , we performed a simple linear fit to the data , as :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the linear slope and @xmath78 is the intercept .",
    "we have used a non - weighted levenberg - marquardt least - squares fit @xcite .",
    "we chose not to weight the data points using their error bars as those refer to the precision of each color measurement and not to the expected departure from the global trend .",
    "we have obtained the solution :    @xmath79    with a @xmath80 and @xmath81 degrees - of - freedom ( see fig .  [ ik_br_fits.fig ] ) .",
    "secondly , since our previous analysis also showed the possibility that ckbos consist of two different homogenous groups of objects , neither with any color - inclination correlation , we fitted the data with a two - constant stepwise function :    @xmath82    _ i.e. _ , a stepwise function with a constant color value below a given critical inclination @xmath60 , and with another constant value above @xmath60 . we have fitted this function to the data iteratively , changing @xmath60 from @xmath34 to @xmath36 with increments of @xmath35 . for each iteration , @xmath83 and @xmath84",

    "thirdly , we chose to fit a constant - linear stepwise function :    @xmath90    where we have a @xmath83 constant value below some critical inclination @xmath33 , and a linear behavior with slope @xmath77 and intercept @xmath84 above @xmath33 .",
    "as for the previous case , we have fitted this function iteratively changing @xmath60 from @xmath34 to @xmath36 with increments of @xmath35 . for each iteration @xmath83 , @xmath77 , and @xmath84",
    "are fitted while @xmath60 is kept fixed .",
    "the fitting results for each @xmath60 are shown in table [ fits.tab ] .",
    "the best fit , from the minimum @xmath85 , is obtained when @xmath62 :    @xmath91    with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see fig .  [ ik_br_fits.fig ] ) .",
    "the smallest @xmath85 value points to this solution as the best . note that in our analysis the @xmath85 does not tell us the probability of eventually obtaining a better fit if we had another sample of ckbos ( with smaller error bars , for example ) .",
    "this last solution is the best relative to the other cases , and validates our findings as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "we have seen that ckbos up to @xmath94 are homogeneous in terms of their @xmath13 color ( see fig .",
    "[ hist_br_ik_stacked.fig ] ) and that they are redder than ckbos with @xmath95 .",
    "if this is due to the existence of two independent populations , then we might expect some mixing of the two at inclinations close to the boundary .",
    "such mixing might also be expected from dynamical considerations as cold ( low-@xmath12 ) ckbos may be pumped to higher inclinations ( @xmath96 ) due to interactions with resonances or even with a potential `` planetoid '' ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can not compute the @xmath85 from the superposition of two functions for direct comparison with the fits obtained in the previous section .",
    "however , we have used the functional core - halo inclination decomposition proposed by @xcite to consider the possibility that the observed color systematics ( fig .  [ plot_ik_br.fig ] ) result from the overlap of a red core population ( low inclinations ) with a blue halo population ( high inclinations ) .",
    "simulations show that this solution fails in the sense that it can not reproduce the color jump observed at @xmath97 . the combination of the broad inclination distribution for the halo objects ( see fig .  20 of @xcite ) and the large color dispersion we observe for the bluer objects ( @xmath98 ; see also fig .  [ hist_br_ik_stacked.fig ] ) results in a very smooth and broad color distribution at all inclinations , except for @xmath99 where red objects are slightly more abundant .",
    "interestingly , the distribution of @xmath13 colors of ckbos below @xmath94 is remarkably gaussian , which attests to their color homogeneity .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( hereafter ks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives a confidence level of 99.3% ( @xmath100 ) that the colors of @xmath101 ckbos are drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath102 and standard deviation @xmath103 ( values calculated from the sample ) .",
    "this stands in contrast to the color distribution of objects above @xmath94 ( mean @xmath104 and standard deviation @xmath105 ) for which the ks test gives a probability of only @xmath106 of being derived from a gaussian . from the ks test",
    "the whole sample of @xmath13 colors of ckbos has only a @xmath107 probability of being gaussian .",
    "the lack of a break in the color distribution near @xmath108 stands in sharp contrast to the reportedly bimodal distribution of orbital inclinations @xcite .",
    "some models have attempted to relate dynamically cold ( @xmath8 ) , red kbos to a primordial trans - neptunian disk source while dynamically hotter ( @xmath109 ) , blue kbos are supposed to originate by outward scattering from sources interior to neptune @xcite .",
    "these models make the _ ad hoc _ assumption that hot and cold kbo populations have intrinsically different colors ( blue and red , respectively ) .",
    "this assumption is inconsistent with the data .",
    "the @xmath13 distribution pays no regard to the reported hot / cold inclination distribution .",
    "some of our objects possess large photometric error bars . under the penalty of too low sampling",
    "we have also looked for the best fitting solution using only the 48 ckbos with colors having errors @xmath110 .",
    "the best fitting solutions are found with equal probability for eq .",
    "[ stepfit : eq ] when @xmath60 varies from @xmath111 to @xmath112 ( with this sample we have no colors between these two inclination values ) .",
    "when comparing the mean colors of objects above and below @xmath60 with this reduced sample we also find equal incompatibility levels for @xmath113 up to @xmath112 , as expected from the previous result .",
    "also , when not discarding the two apparent outliers mentioned in section [ dataset : sec ] the correlation values diminish slightly but all other results remain identical .    our sample of ckbos was selected following a criterion based on the magnitude of the error bars instead of performing an average of all the published measurements for each object as used in the mboss sample ( see section [ dataset : sec ] ) .",
    "to check the influence of this criterion we have double - checked our results using the ckbo colors from the mboss sample , since some color values were slightly different from those we have used .",
    "the outcome is identical to that of section [ bestfit : sec ] .",
    "lastly , @xcite suggest an orbit classification scheme slightly different from the one used here ( by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the classifications of most kbos remain unchanged between these two schemes and , not surprisingly , we find that our conclusions are statistically independent of the scheme employed .",
    "the main goal of this work has been to investigate the color - inclination trend seen for classical kuiper belt objects ( ckbos ) .",
    "we have analyzed a sample of @xmath13 colors of 69 objects , excluding 2 apparent outliers as well as colors with error bars larger than @xmath114 .",
    "objects were classified as ckbos according to a definition by @xcite .",
    "orbital inclinations , denoted @xmath12 , were calculated relative to the kuiper belt plane following @xcite . our results may be summarized as :    1 .",
    "the linear @xmath13 color - inclination correlation of ckbos measured over the full range of inclinations from @xmath115 to @xmath116 is @xmath117 , corresponding to a significance level larger than @xmath118 .",
