    "solving for nuclear properties with the best available nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials  @xcite , supplemented by three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) as needed  @xcite , using a quantum many - particle framework that respects all the known symmetries of the potentials is referred to as an `` ab initio '' problem and is recognized to be computationally hard . through the unedf scidac collaboration  @xcite of nuclear theorists , applied mathematicians , and computer scientists there has been a rapid development of ab initio methods for solving finite nuclei , which has opened a range of nuclear phenomena that can now be evaluated to high precision using realistic inter - nucleon interactions .",
    "a commonly used approach in nuclear physics is the configuration interaction ( ci ) method for solving the many - body nuclear hamiltonian in a ( sufficiently large ) single - particle basis space . in this approach ,",
    "the many - body schrodinger equation becomes a large sparse matrix problem .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are the binding energies , and the corresponding eigenvectors the nuclear wave functions , which can be employed to evaluate experimental quantities . in order to reach numerical convergence for fundamental problems of interest ,",
    "the matrix dimension often exceeds two billion ; obtaining the lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such large sparse matrices poses significant challenges even on today s leadership class facilities .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss convergence rates of ci calculations , contrasting full configuration interaction ( fci ) , which is a truncation on the single - particle basis space only , with the @xmath3 truncation , which is a truncation on the many - body basis space .",
    "the latter is commonly used in nuclear structure calculations , not only because of its superior convergence rate for light nuclei , but also because it leads to an exact seperation of the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion and the translationally - invariant wavefunction .",
    "we use a recently introduced technique for unfolding the cm motion from the one - body density matrices  @xcite , which allows us to obtain translationally - invariant nucleon densities . with this technique",
    "we can reveal interesting phenomena such as clustering emerging from our ab initio caculations .",
    "in particular we show that the ground state of @xmath1be consists of two clusters of protons and neutrons separated by a few fm , consistent with @xmath4-cluster models , with the extra neutron forming a ring or donut shape . we also discuss emerging rotational band structure in @xmath1be , and present new results for the ground state energies of the beryllium isotopes .",
    "finally , we discuss recent results for the anomalously long lifetime of @xmath5 , which can be reproduced by the inclusion of three - nucleon forces .",
    "we analyse in detail what the influence of the 3nf is , not only on the transition between the ground states of @xmath2c and @xmath2n , but also on the transition between the first excited @xmath6 state of @xmath2c and the ground state of @xmath2n .",
    "we identify that it is the structure of the ground state of @xmath2n , rather than that of @xmath2c , that responds sensitively to the 3nf , and therefore leads to the anomalously small transition matrix element .",
    "in a no - core ci approach , the wavefunction @xmath7 of a nucleus consisting of @xmath8 nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) is expanded in an @xmath8-body basis of slater determinants of single - particle states ; that is @xmath9 where @xmath10 are @xmath8-body slater determinants .",
    "conventionally , one uses a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis for the single - particle states , but it is straightforward to extend this approach to a more general single - particle basis  @xcite .",
    "we use the so - called @xmath11-scheme for our basis .",
    "the single - particle states are labelled by the quantum numbers @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radial and orbital ho quantum numbers , with @xmath16 the number of ho quanta ; @xmath14 is the total single - particle spin , and @xmath15 its projection along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the many - body basis states have well - defined total spin - projection , which is simply the sum of @xmath15 of the single - particle states , @xmath18 , hence the name @xmath11-scheme .",
    "however , in general the many - body basis states do not have a well - defined total @xmath19 .",
    "some of the advantages of this scheme is that it is very simple to implement , and that in two runs ( for positive and negative parity ) , we get the complete low - lying spectrum , including the ground state , even if we do not know what the spin of the ground state is .",
    "the interaction @xmath20 , typically a two - body ( nn ) , sometimes supplemented by a three - body ( 3nf ) potential , is also expressed in this many - body basis , as is the kinetic energy @xmath21 .",
    "diagonalizing the resulting matrix @xmath22 gives us the eigenstates and eigenenergies .",
    "in general , we are only interested in the low - lying spectrum , so we do not need a complete diagonalization of this matrix , which can be rather large , exceeding 12 billion basis states in a recent application .      in principle , by expanding the nuclear wavefunction in a complete basis , we would obtain exact results for a given input interaction @xmath20 .",
    "however , such a basis is infinite - dimensional , and practical calculations can only be done in a finite - dimensional truncation of a complete basis . in order to recover exact results , independent of the basis space truncation",
    ", we typically perform a series of calculations in increasingly large basis spaces .",
    "based on the results of such a series of calculations , we either find that we have achieved numerical convergence ( within a certain numerical uncertainty ) , or extrapolate to the complete basis ( with a certain extrapolation uncertainty ) .",
    "of course , for some observables it is much harder to achieve convergence than for others , as we shall see .",
    "in addition , one could employ renormalization techniques to accelerate convergence in relatively small basis spaces .",
    "full configuration interaction or fci employs a widely - know truncation in which all many - body basis states are retained that can be constructed from a finite set of single - particle states .",
    "this method is commonly used in atomic and molecular physics .    in ab initio nuclear physics",
    "however , we generally use a truncation on the many - body basis space , rather than on the single - particle basis . to be specific ,",
    "we construct a finite - dimensional basis by a truncation on the total number of quanta of the system .",
    "that is , the many - body basis for a nucleus consisting of @xmath8 nucleons is limited to states that satisfy the condition @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of quanta of each of the single - particle states in the many - body basis state ; @xmath25 is the minimal number of quanta for that nucleus ; and @xmath3 is the truncation parameter . for ho single - particle states , or more general , for any basis in which the single - particle states have radial and orbital quantum numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we have @xmath26 .",
    "there are several advantages to this @xmath3 truncation .",
    "one is that , in combination with a ho basis for the single - particle basis , it leads to an exact factorization of the cm motion and the relative motion . in nuclear physics , we deal with a selfbound system , and we have to either use relative coordinates for our calculations , or ( as we do here ) single - particle coordinates .",
    "note that the wavefunctions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) are functions of @xmath8 ( independent ) single - particle coordinates , not @xmath27 relative coordinates .",
    "this makes the anti - symmetrizations and bookkeeping in the numerical codes almost trivial , but it does mean that we have to somehow seperate out the cm wavefunction from the translationally - invariant wavefunction .",
    "a ho single - particle basis , in combination with @xmath3 truncation , allows for an exact factorization of the cm wavefunction @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not depend on the cm motion . in order to remove the states with cm excitations from the low - lying spectrum , we use the lawson method  @xcite",
    "whereby we add a lagrange multiplier term , @xmath31 , to the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "the actual hamiltonian that we are using thus takes the form @xmath32 note that although this hamiltonian depends explicitly on the ho parameter @xmath33 , as well as on @xmath34 , the low - lying spectrum ( i.e. states with @xmath35 ) only depends implicitly on @xmath33 through the basis space truncation , and becomes independent of @xmath33 in the infinite - basis limit .",

    "it turns out that the numerical convergence is significantly faster with an @xmath3 truncation than with an fci truncation  @xcite in our nuclear physics applications . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcivsnmax ] we compare the convergence rate for two light nuclei , @xmath36he and @xmath37li , with an fci truncation and with an @xmath3 truncation .",
    "these calculations were performed with a realistic two - body interaction derived from inverse scattering theory , jisp16  @xcite , which has been demonstrated to have good convergence rates for the ground state energies of nuclei with @xmath38  @xcite ; and it gives a good description of light nuclei without explicit three - body forces .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fcivsnmax ] shows that for @xmath36he both fci and the @xmath3 truncation have a similar convergence rate , at least in terms of the ho parameter @xmath33 and the truncation parameter @xmath39 and @xmath3 respectively . as the truncation parameter increases ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath33 decreases , and the succesive @xmath39 curves ( dotted ) and @xmath3 curves ( solid ) converge to the same ground state energy of @xmath40  mev .",
    "however , as function of the basis space dimension , the @xmath3 truncation converges much more rapidly than the fci calculations , as is illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fcivsnmax ] .",
    "e.g. , an @xmath41 calculation with a basis dimension of less than 50,000 for @xmath36he leads to a ground state energy that is well within 100 kev of the exact result , whereas for an fci calculation @xmath42 with a basis dimension of almost 2 million is needed in order to achieve a similar level of convergence . for @xmath37li , an fci calculation with a basis dimension of over a billion",
    "is still more than 3 mev from the exact ground state energy , whereas an @xmath43 calculation with a basis dimension of about 10 million is within 1 mev of the converged ground state energy . also for other observables",
    "@xcite , such as radii and quadrupole moments , the convergence seems to be slower with the fci truncation than with the @xmath3 truncation , when viewed as function of the basis space dimension .",
    "finally , with the @xmath3 truncation one may easily separate the positive parity spectrum and the negative parity spectrum .",
    "two succesive shells have opposite parity , depending on whether the orbital angular momentum is even or odd . by increasing the total number of quanta of the many - body basis states by two quanta at a time",
    ", we automatically create a basis with a specific parity .",
    "the natural parity of a nucleus is given by its valence space , for which our calculations start with @xmath44 ; for the unnatural parity spectrum we would perform a series of calculations starting with @xmath45 . in both cases , @xmath3 is increased by two quanta as we increase the basis space .",
    "( of course , it is straightforward to include a parity - constraint in fci calculations , and in fact , the dimensions given here for fci calculations do incorporate such a constraint . )      for a very light nucleus like @xmath36he or @xmath37li one can achieve convergence of the ground state energy and other observables by simply going to a sufficiently large basis , but for larger nuclei that is not practical .",
    "however , based on a series of calculations in finite basis spaces , we can extrapolate those results to a complete , infinite - dimensional , basis .",
    "empirically  @xcite the nuclear binding energies seem to converge exponentially with @xmath3 @xmath46 there are several different ways in which one can exploit this ( empirical ) convergence behavior . here",
    "we use three consecutive @xmath3 values at a fixed basis space parameter @xmath33 in order to estimate a converged binding energy at that @xmath33 . under the assumption that the convergence is indeed exponential , such an extrapolation",
    "should get more accurate as @xmath3 increases ; the difference between the extrapolated results from two consecutive sets of three @xmath3 values is then used as an estimate of the numerical uncertainty associated with the extrapolation .",
    "we do this for a range of basis space @xmath33 values , in order to check the consistency of the extrapolated results and their error estimates .",

    "the extrapolated result appears to be very well converged ( i.e. consistent within diminishing errors ) starting from @xmath41 , not only as function of @xmath3 , but also as function of the basis space parameter @xmath33 , as can be seen from the right panel of fig .",

    "our final no - core full configuration ( ncfc ) result we combine the extrapolation results for a range of ho parameters at and slightly above the variational minimum to arrive at our best estimate for the results in the complete basis , independent of all basis parameters .      in order to reliably extrapolate to the complete basis , we need results in finite bases up to at least @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for unnatural parity states ) , and preferably @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for unnatural parity states ) or higher .",
    "this leads to a computational challenge , because the basis space dimension increases rather rapidly with @xmath3 and with the number of particles .",

    "the largest many - body basis dimension that mfdn can handle is about 10 to 15 billion with two - body forces only , and about one billion with two- and three - body forces .",
    "mfdn constructs the many - body basis states in @xmath11-scheme and the corresponding hamiltonian matrix , and solves for the lowest eigenstates using an iterative lanczos algorithm . at the end of a run",
    ", it writes the nuclear wavefunctions to file , and evaluates selected physical observables which can be compared to experimental data ( the wavefunctions themselves are not experimentally observable )",
    ". it also writes out the one - body density matrix elements ( in the underlying single - particle basis ) , which can be used for further analysis .",
    "the matrix is distributed in a 2-dimensional fashion over the processors , and we work with the lower triangle only , because the matrix is symmetric ( and real ) . because of the 2-dimensional distribution of the matrix , it runs on @xmath58 processors , where @xmath12 is the number of `` diagonal '' processors .",
    "both the memory usage and the ( local ) cpu usage are distributed evenly over all processors .",
    "this load - balancing is achieved by a round - robin distribution of the @xmath11-scheme basis states over the `` diagonal '' processors .",
    "the disadvantage of this scheme is that it destroys any natural sparsity structure in the matrix .",
    "we are currently working on a new load - balancing scheme that retains some of the natural sparsity structure ( version 14 in fig .",

    "among the be - isotopes there are several interesting and challenging problems for ab initio nuclear structure calculations : @xmath4-clustering is likely to play an important role , in particular for @xmath59be and @xmath1be ; there are several rotational bands ; and they are among the lightest nuclei for which both positive and negative parity states are known experimentally . with the ncfc approach described above , we should be able to perform reasonably accurate calculations for the be - isotopes from @xmath37be up to @xmath60be , provided we use a suitably soft interaction such as jisp16 .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    starting with @xmath59be , states of both partities appear in the low - lying spectrum ; and for @xmath97be the lowest positive parity state is the ground state , contrary to the expectations based on the shell model , which predicts negative parity ground states for all odd @xmath0-shell nuclei . for @xmath95be through @xmath57be we performed our calculations for both natural parity states and for unnatural parity states .",
    "we then perform independent extrapolations for the lowest positive parity states and the for the lowest negative parity states .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : beground ] we show the difference between the binding energy of the lowest natural parity state and the lowest unnatural parity state . for most isotopes",
    "we expect this difference to be positive , but for isotopes with parity inversion it becomes negative . although our results do not quite reproduce the observed parity inversion for @xmath97be , parity inversion is within our numerical error estimates for this isotope .",
    "furthermore , over the range of isotopes from @xmath98be to @xmath97be our results are in very good qualitative agreement with the data : with jisp16 we seem to underbind all unnatural parity states by a similar amount of about @xmath63  mev . based on these results",
    ", we also predict parity inversion for @xmath57be ; experimentally , the parity of the ground state is not confirmed , though likely to be negative  @xcite , which indeed implies parity inversion ( @xmath57be has one neutron in the @xmath56-shell , so the natural parity is positive ) .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the relative underbinding of the unnatural parity states compared to the natural parity states in beryllium is a deficiency of the nn interaction , jisp16 , or due to underestimating the numerical error in the extrapolation to the infinite basis , in particular for the unnatural parity states  @xcite .",
    "also the general underbinding of the ground states hints at a deficiency of jisp16 .",
    "indeed , it is unlikely that this interaction is perfect : it was fitted to the nn scattering data , as well as to select observables in light nuclei , in particular to @xmath37li .",
    "nevertheless , the overall agreement between data and our calculation is quite encouraging , and we expect to be able to get even closer to the data with improved nn and 3nf potentials .    for a true ab initio calculation one would obtain the nuclear forces ( nn , 3nf , etc . ) from the underlying quantum field theory , qcd .",
    "unfortunately , that is not yet possible without introducing free parameters .",
    "based on qcd , one can derive nonrelativistic effective nn , 3nf , and even 4nf nuclear potentials using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "such a derivation determines the structure of the nuclear interaction , but not the numerical constants that govern the strength of the different terms in the interaction  these have to be fitted to low - energy nuclear physics data .",
    "( in the future they may be calculable through lattice qcd . )",
    "the anomalously long lifetime of @xmath2c , @xmath99 years , compared to lifetimes of other light nuclei undergoing the same decay process , allowed gamow  teller ( gt ) beta - decay , poses a major challenge to ab initio nuclear structure calculations .",
    "not only is the number of particles ( 14 ) pushing the limit of what ab initio calculations can reliably calculate , the experimental lifetime can only be reproduced by an anomalously small matrix element for this transition .",
    "this suggests that delicate cancellations could play a crucial role , which always poses a challenge to numerical calculations . on the other hand , since the transition operator , in leading approximation , depends only on the nucleon spin and isospin but not on the spatial coordinate , this decay provides a precision tool to inspect selected features of the initial and final states .",
    "traditional realistic nn forces alone appear insufficient to produce the observed lifetime  @xcite , indicating that three - body forces may be needed . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the 3nf of chpt plays a major role in producing a transition rate that is near zero , needed for the anomalous long lifetime .",
    "we used the chiral two- and three - body potentials of chpt  @xcite and the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) using lee ",

    "furthermore , it is insensitive to the interaction : jisp16 gives approximately the same result as the chiral interaction , with or without 3-body forces .",
    "our calculations are in reasonable agreement with experiment : the measured transition rate from the ground state in @xmath2n to the low - lying @xmath6 states in @xmath2c is @xmath125  @xcite , compared to our calculated value for the transition rate of about 1.6 .",
    "the situation is very different for the gt matrix element between the ground state of @xmath2n and the @xmath126 ground state of @xmath2c .",
