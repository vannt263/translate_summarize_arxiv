    "there are two questions in modern particle physics that have got more attention than any other .",
    "the first one is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the second one is the nature of the cold dark matter ( dm ) of the universe .",
    "the recent cdf measurement of an anomalously large @xmath2 asymmetry  @xcite and the observation of a peak in the dijet invariant mass distribution in association with a @xmath3 boson  @xcite have been most unexpected and seemingly unrelated to these questions .",
    "therefore the proposed explanations to those results often involve rather exotic physics meant to explain the cdf results alone .",
    "one very interesting exception in the long list of proposed models is the one by isidori and kamenik @xcite .",
    "although the model was proposed to explain the anomalous forward - backward ( fb ) @xmath4 asymmetry , it involves  usual \" particles , stops and neutralinos , that may originate from supersymmetric models like the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "therefore the model provides a dm candidate with mass of order 2 - 3  gev .",
    "( the cogent experiment recently announced possible evidence for light dm @xcite , but their region of spin - independent direct detection cross section is several magnitudes lower than in the model @xcite . )",
    "such a light dm is very difficult to test even in the most sensitive dm direct detection experiments such as xenon100 and , at first sight , seems to be experimentally allowed  @xcite ( see @xcite for an up - to - date analysis of the xenon results ) .",
    "in addition , the authors claim that the model gives a non - resonant contribution to the @xmath5 channel that may improve the agreement between data and theoretical expectations .",
    "it is intriguing that with a rather minimalistic set of new particles with well - defined couplings and masses one can simultaneously explain the @xmath4 fb asymmetry , the dm of the universe as well as address the observed @xmath5 excess .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the model @xcite in detail and to work out the related phenomenology .",
    "we incorporate two versions of the model into the micromegas  @xcite package allowing the neutralino to be either a dirac or a majorana fermion . while the collider phenomenology is not sensitive to the nature of a dm fermion , cosmological observables like the dm abundance and dm annihilation cross section at @xmath6 depend crucially on it .",
    "we compute the dm abundance and spin - independent direct detection cross section per nucleon with micromegas by scanning over the particle masses and couplings that explain the cdf @xmath2 fb asymmetry .",
    "we find that , indeed , for the model parameters allowed by the asymmetry , the observed dm thermal relic abundance  @xcite can be generated and dm as light as 2 - 3  gev is possible if its couplings to quarks approach non - perturbative values .",
    "such a light dm is constrained by two observables .",
    "first , the observed lack of distortions in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum due to dm annihilations at redshifts @xmath7-@xmath8 puts a stringent constraint on gev - scale dm independently of cosmological uncertainties such as the dm halo profiles , densities and distribution  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we compute the constraints on @xmath9 for the annihilation channel @xmath10 and show that present cmb measurements disfavor a light dirac neutralino as the dm .",
    "the majorana neutralino annihilation cross section at @xmath6 is proportional to the @xmath11-quark mass  @xcite and is not constrained .",
    "second , the spin independent dm - nucleon scattering cross section is so large that cresst - i  @xcite , texono @xcite and xenon100  @xcite experiments together exclude the light dm possibility in this model entirely .",
    "also , @xmath12 can not be a subdominant component of dm because this would require increasing its annihilation cross section and , consequently , the direct detection cross section by the same amount . we conclude that the model proposed by isidori and kamenik can be a viable model for explaining the @xmath4 fb asymmetry but the neutralino @xmath12 can not be a stable particle and can not contribute to the dm abundance .",
    "we note that a re - analysis of the experiments @xcite presents conservative bounds on detector sensitivities . in this case , if , in addition , the local dm density in the location of the earth is a few times smaller than the present estimates , a small dirac neutralino parameter space opens up for @xmath13  gev .",
    "the exact measurement of the cmb by the planck mission will be the definitive test for this possibility , except when the neutralino is a strongly subdominant component ( below 30% ) of dm .",
    "in addition , we study whether the model can reproduce the dijet excess observed by cdf .",
    "we find that the model indeed yields an excess of the @xmath5 signature but the invariant mass distribution of the dijet is so broad that it can not explain the cdf observation of a peak , and the escaping neutralinos lead to a strong modification of the missing @xmath14 distribution .",
    "in addition to standard model ( sm ) particles , the model comprises the color triplet scalar @xmath15 and neutral fermion @xmath16 that are both @xmath17 singlets . in the case",
    "@xmath16 is a dirac fermion , the lagrangian is @xmath18 while in the case of majorana @xmath16 , the lagrangian reads @xmath19    in numerical computations , the used ranges for parameters were @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . to avoid bounds from flavor physics , we take @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 pairs used were selected from the region compatible with the @xmath26-asymmetry at @xmath27 level in fig .  1 of @xcite , extrapolated up to the value @xmath28 .",
    "we stress that our conclusions do not depend on the details of extrapolation .",
    "a variation of @xmath29 is added for completeness ; as long as @xmath30 , correct @xmath31 asymmetry is achieved @xcite , but the exact value of @xmath29 only influences the @xmath5 and missing @xmath1 distribution as shown below . of course , different values of @xmath29 up to @xmath32 imply different scales for new physics .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the most interesting result of the paper @xcite is that the model simultaneously explains the measured top quark fb asymmetry at tevatron and provides the correct thermal relic abundance of dm . in order to compute the observables",
    "related to dm numerically as precisely as possible we incorporated both lagrangians , eqs . and , into micromegas code by using the feynrules package @xcite for mathematica .",
    "while for collider observables at tevatron there should not be major differences between these two cases , the cosmological observables depend crucially on the nature of fermionic dm . because a majorana particle can have only effective four - fermion axial - vector interaction  @xcite , both the behavior and the magnitude of the dm annihilation cross section will be different in the two cases , as well as the dm scattering cross section with matter .",
    "we scan over the model parameters as explained above and compute the resulting dm relic abundance and spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "all the generated points can explain the cdf @xmath4 fb asymmetry .",
    "requiring @xmath36 which is smaller than the upper limit of the wmap7 @xmath37 range , we plot in fig .",

    "the magnitude of the coupling @xmath35 is represented with the color code .",
    "notice that we do allow the model to provide just a subdominant component of the dm of the universe .",
    "as detector sensitivity lines are given for the central value of dm abundance , the cross section of points is scaled down by the fraction of @xmath12 dm in all dm , namely , by @xmath33 . however , because the annihilation cross section of @xmath39 and the direct detection cross section of @xmath40 both scale with @xmath35 , the prediction is rather sharp . in the same figure",
    "we also give the present dm direct detection constraints .",
    "while xenon100 excludes dm with mass above 5 - 6 gev , cresst - i and texono exclude all the allowed parameter space both for dirac as well as for majorana dm .",
    "although the sensitivities of cresst - i and texono are not comparable with the xenon100 one , their bounds extend down to 1 gev because as a target cresst -",
    "i used al and texono used ge that are much lighter than xe .",
    "those model predictions can be readily understood with the help of analytic expressions for annihilation cross section obtained in @xcite . in order to allow the dm mass to be in gev region , the cross section of the annihilation process @xmath41 and , consequently",
    ", the coupling @xmath35 , must be large .",
    "this explains also why the direct detection cross sections are large . while the dirac fermion cross section contain both @xmath42- and @xmath43-wave contributions , the majorana dm annihilation is purely @xmath43-wave and , in the limit of vanishing @xmath11-quark mass , vanishes for vanishing velocities . therefore , to obtain a large enough cross section for the majorana neutralino",
    "the coupling @xmath35 must be very large .",
    "consequently the spin - independent direct detection cross section for the majorana case is larger than in the dirac case .    because the interpretation of results of the direct detection experiments depends on the local dm density in the neighborhood of the solar system",
    ", one can make an attempt to save the model by appealing to the conservative reanalyzed sensitivity bounds for cresst - i and texono given by @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma : si : mchi ] with dashed lines , and reducing the dm density a few times . indeed , cosmological uncertainties in determining the dm halo of our galaxy may be larger than expected and the model prediction for dirac neutralino is not too far from the cresst - i bound .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the present wmap7 cmb measurements imply strong constraints on the annihilation cross section of the gev - scale dm .",
    "those constraints are free of uncertainties of dm halo shapes and distributions but apply for the cross sections at temperatures @xmath44 in our case the cmb measurements constrain the dirac dm case only because the majorana dm annihilation cross section vanishes for the reionization temperature @xmath45 .",
    "we repeated the analyses of ref .",
    "@xcite for the channel @xmath46 .",
    "the constraints in the @xmath47 plane are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma : v : mstop ] together with the area of model predictions using the same color code as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma : si : mchi ] .",
    "the lines in the figure present wmap7 @xmath48 and @xmath49 bounds and the predicted sensitivity of the planck mission @xcite for the central value of @xmath50 . because the intensity of annihilation is proportional to the square of density",
    ", we scale @xmath51 by the factor of @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding cmb constraints are also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma : si : mchi ] for @xmath12 as the dominant component of dm .",
    "consequently , if the detector bounds could be reduced at least by 3 - 4 times by assuming that the local dm density is smaller than expected ( in effect , detection sensitivity lines shift up by the same factor ) , at @xmath53 level a very small parameter space at @xmath54-@xmath55  gev for dirac dm opens up . however , the variability of the local density of dm is unknown experimentally and very poorly estimated by computer simulations at the spatial scales of the solar system @xcite .",
    "thus we are unable to give a quantitative estimation for the probability of having local density of dm that is a few times smaller , but such a reduction is highly unlikely ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "however , while we do not directly compare the simulation to the data , in view of our imperfect detector simulation , lack of next - to - leading order and jet energy scale corrections , it is obvious that the distribution is much broader than the cdf bump and that the excess thus extends to much lower and higher values of @xmath65 .",
