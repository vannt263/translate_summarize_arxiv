    "classical be stars pose two core problems : ( i ) how do they eject matter ? ( ii )",
    "how can ejecta form a keplerian disk ? as ghoreyshi et al .",
    ", klement et al . , and vieira et al .",
    "illustrate in these proceedings , viscosity is the key process that drives the exchange of angular momentum between gas parcels so that @xmath11% of the matter reaches an orbit .",
    "by contrast , the first be - star challenge has not yet found a well - documented general solution .",
    "the only case of clear causality was presented by @xcite , who observed that outbursts of @xmath2 cen occur when two of six spectroscopic nonradial pulsation ( nrp ) modes are in phase at the stellar surface . when ranked by velocity amplitude ,",
    "both the first and the second as well as the first and the third mode combine in this fashion .",
    "very plausibly , it was interpreted as a beat phenomenon although direct evidence of a typical beat pattern was not produced .",
    "identified all three as @xmath3 @xmath4-modes which prevail in most be stars .",
    "this relatively thin factbase was widely adopted and modified to the more general notion that during outbursts of be stars an unspecified number of nrp modes somehow combine to liberate the energy needed to eject significant amounts of matter .",
    "this conclusion supposedly received support from photometric observations of be stars in outburst when many spikes in the power spectra change their strength , with a large fraction of them becoming detectable only around the outbursts . to this end , the spikes were interpreted as nrp modes . however , and @xcite questioned this identification and showed that much of the variability power involved arises from circumstellar processes .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of broad - lined stars pulsating in multiple modes and undergoing additional outbursts is a very resource - demanding undertaking .",
    "however , not only is the technique expensive , but in about 20 years it has found only that one case of @xmath2 cen .",
    "28 cyg and @xmath5 cen were eventually confirmed by photometry ( cf .",
    "sect .  3 ) .    the advent of photometry with tiny to medium - sized satellites and corresponding costs has opened up new opportunities with the amenities of space observatories : smei @xcite , most @xcite , corot @xcite , kepler @xcite , and brite @xcite .",
    "all five missions have observed be stars .",
    "examples ( except for most ) will be discussed in the next section .",
    "even precision photometry is not perfect : in rapid rotators such as be stars , frequencies are subject to large rotational modification and can be treacherous indicators of mode types .",
    "moreover , the latitudinal component of low - order @xmath4-mode velocity fields is a strong identifying symptom in spectra of pole - on stars whereas the photometric signal is largest in the equatorial plane but not visible in true pole - on stars . in be stars",
    ", there is an additional photometric pitfall : light from the central star is reprocessed in the disk .",
    "therefore , variable amounts of circumstellar matter contribute an additional variability by this kind of light echo , which is weakest at inclination angles around 70 degrees @xcite .",
    "a strong example is @xmath2 cen , where this effect precluded the detection by brite of the spectroscopic modes , the photometric signature of which is low at the given low inclination .",
    "in the following , frequency differences and difference (= @xmath0 ) frequencies need to be carefully distinguished : the former can be calculated between any two frequencies .",
    "a @xmath0 frequency is something much more specific because , in addition to being a simple frequency difference , it plays its own role as a third variability .",
    "this is not the case for arbitrary frequency differencies , which do not normally have any physical meaning ; in power spectra of synthetic data with two sinusoidal variations , difference ( and sum ) frequencies do not occur .",
    "@xmath0 frequencies were found in the following be stars :    * @xmath5 centauri * ( b2 ) : two retrograde @xmath6 @xmath4-modes with 1.732 and 1.764 c / d are known from spectra . in agreement with the nearly equator - on orientation and the low h@xmath7 line - emission activity , brite detected both with relatively large amplitudes slightly above 2 mmag .",
    "a frequency of 0.034 c / d roughly equal to the difference between the two nrp frequencies was also discovered .",
    "it has two unexpected properties : at 15 mmag its amplitude is 2.5 times as large as the sum of the two nrp modes , perhaps indicative of nonlinear mode coupling . and",
    "it is not a beat frequency but an approximately sinusoidal variability in its own right .",
    "increased scatter around the extrema of the associated light curve and modifications of the amplitude and phase of the circumstellar tefl frequency with the stellar @xmath0 frequency imply that the latter modulates and perhaps even drives mass loss .    * 28 cygni * ( b2.5 ) : two ( numerically imperfect ) @xmath0 frequencies occur in brite data ( baade et al . , in prep . ) : 0.051 c / d @xmath8 1.598c / d - 1.544 c / d and 0.217 c / d @xmath8 1.598 c / d - 1.380",
    "the amplitude ( 8.5 mmag ) of the slower variability exceeds those ( @xmath95.5 mmag ) of the two retrograde quadrupole @xmath4-modes @xcite while in the second tuple the amplitudes are less different .",
    "indications of a link to mass loss exist as in @xmath5 cen but are much weaker . like in @xmath2 cen",
    "( provided this star does possess genuine @xmath0 frequencies ) , the two @xmath0 frequencies have one parent nrp frequency in common so that only three nrp modes seem involved in their formation .    *",
    "hd 50209 * ( b9 ) : from corot observations , suggest the presence of rotational frequency splitting although the implied frequency of the zonal mode ( @xmath10=0 ) would be unusually low ( 0.108 c / d ) .",
    "indications of rotational splitting are not commonly found in be stars . if hd 50209 is such a case , it illustrates that a frequency difference is not a difference ( @xmath0 ) frequency : the frequency difference is a quantity with high diagnostic potential but does not correspond to a separate stand - alone variability .    *",
    "hd 49330 * ( b1 ) : in the last third of the 137-d monitoring period with corot , detected a 0.03-mag outburst , during which the two base frequencies , 11.86 c / d and 16.89 c / d , lost part of their power .",
    "the difference between them appears as a genuine @xmath0 frequency at 5.03 c / d ( confirmed by rivinius et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . in contemporaneous echelle spectra , determined an azimuthal mode order @xmath11 for the 11.86-c / d variability and @xmath12 for the higher - frequency mode .    *",
    "hd 186567 * : the kepler data were analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results based on conventional lomb - scargle power spectra agree fairly perfectly .",
    "in particular , the two investigations found a @xmath0 frequency at 0.276 c / d corresponding to 4.010 c / d - 3.734 c / d .",
    "both of the latter frequencies are the strongest peaks in a group .",
    "rivinius et al .",
    "also conducted a wavelet transform .",
    "it revealed the two amplitudes as time dependent on a scale of @xmath1 20 days with variations being antiphased .",
    "in stark contrast , the variability with the @xmath0 frequency only showed a slow and perfectly smooth trend over the four years of observations ; howvwer , this is also favoured by the wavelet method .",
    "* als 10705 * : @xcite analyzed kepler data and found that the frequency differencies 4.77 c / d  4.41 c / d and 5.13 c / d  4.77 c / d are about equal , namely 0.36 c / d . there is a genuine frequency at 0.35 c / d so that the two pairs may not only be a case of frequency splitting but give rise to genuine @xmath0 frequencies .",
    "in addition , the difference between 1.58 c / d and 0.59 c / d ( 0.99 c / d ) is nearly coincident with the largest - amplitude variability at 0.98 c / d .",
    "this could constitute a third @xmath0 frequency .",
    "brite observations of several other be stars were searched for @xmath0 frequencies . for most of them",
    "some excuses can be construed as to why none was found :    @xmath13    late - type be stars : in agreement with most other cool be stars , no periodic short - term variability with semi - amplitude above 1 mmag was seen in @xmath14 lup ( b9.5 ) and @xmath2 lup ( b8 ) . the 5.9-mmag amplitude ( 0.6586 c / d ) in @xmath15 pup ( b8 ) is , therefore , remarkable but the only variability above the detection threshold .",
    "intermediate - type be stars : short - periodic variability was also not detected in 17 tau ( b6 ) , 23 tau ( b6 ) , and @xmath5 tau ( b7 ) . at blue wavelengths , @xmath16 per ( b5 ) exhibits a large - amplitude ( 10.3 mmag ) variability with 0.0355 c / d , which numerically matches the difference between 0.7182 c / d ( 1.8 mmag ) and 0.6829 c / d ( 1.9 mmag ) .",
    "blue and red data are of different quality and quantity and do not give the same results .",
    "in fairly limited datasets , @xmath17 and ( b5 ; only blue data available ) and hr 1113 ( b7 ; only red data available ) appear single - periodic with 0.6500 c / d or 1.3085 c / d ( 1.1 mmag ) and 1.488 c / d ( 2.7 mmag ) , respectively .    in limited data , @xmath18 ori ( b3 ) does not present a significant isolated frequency but",
    "a frequency group around 1.05 c / d , which apparently changed from 2014 to 2015 and perhaps explains the difficulty of establishing a stable frequency . in",
    "even sparser data of 25 cyg ( b3 ) , only one possible frequency was found ( 1.86 c / d , 1.5 mmag ) .",
    "well - observed other earlier - type be stars have much richer power spectra as illustrated in the following .",
    "48 per ( b3 ) : three large - amplitude variations with widely spaced frequencies were detected in this earlier - type shell star ( viewed equator - on ) : 0.0311 c / d ( 5.4 mmag ) , 1.074 c / d ( 4.3 mmag ) , and 2.2594 c / d ( 4.2 mmag ) .",
    "the slow variability is not in any obvious way related to more rapid variations",
    ".    60 cyg ( b1 ) : among the many significant variabilities , one stands out because both its frequency ( 3.336 c / d ) and amplitude ( 6.4 mmag ) are large .    25 ori ( b1 ) : there are two candidate @xmath0 frequencies with large amplitudes : 0.0268 c / d ( 11.3 mmag ) @xmath8 2.9530 c / d ( 2.0 mmag ) - 2.9889 c / d ( 4.8 mmag ) and 0.1897 c / d ( 15.9 mmag ) @xmath8 1.6782",
    "c / d ( 6.9 mmag ) - 1.4888 c / d ( 9.3 mmag ) .",
    "separated by three months , phases of slow , roughly sinusoidal variations occurred with full amplitudes between 200 and 300 mmag .",
    "@xmath19 cas ( b0 ) : in the combined blue and red data ( to extend the time span ) several frequencies were found : 0.2734 c / d ( 1.1 mmag ) , 0.9728 c / d ( 2.2 mmag ) , 2.1838 or 2.1950 c / d ( 0.9 mmag ) , and 2.4797 c / d ( 2.7 mmag ) .",
    "the latter is @xmath13 times the frequency of 0.8225 c / d derived by @xcite from single - site ground - based photometry , which brite does not detect at the 0.6 mmag level .",
    "if the true frequency is the higher one , its interpretation as rotational modulation would put other parameters under considerable stress .",
    "however , the only frequency seen with smei is 0.821895 c / d . for",
    "a be star , 0.27 c / d is an unusual frequency .",
    "but it is very close to the differenc between 2.4797 c / d and 2.1950 c / d .",
    "a possible very low frequency at 0.0204 c / d ( 2.9 mmag ) requires confirmation .",
    "@xmath20 sco ( b0 ) : in red - light observations , this single - lined binary showed several slow variations : 0.0937 c / d ( 0.8 mmag ) , 0.0305 c / d ( 1.9 mmag ) , and 0.01402 c / d ( 1.5 mmag ) .",
    "the latter one could be the difference between 1.0316 c / d ( 0.8 mmag ) and 1.0176 c / d ( 0.9 mmag ) .",
    "unfortunately , the blue data are of lower quality and not sufficient to support or question the red data",
    ".    the brite observations of 28 cma ( b2 ) became available only after this workshop .",
    "the smei data are noisy , and the star is seen at low inclination .    27 cma ( b3 ) is a strong shell star , i.e.  viewed through the disk . at v=4.7 mag it is very faint for smei ; the delivery of brite data took place after this workshop .    in summary",
    ", this list is inconclusive .",
    "( it is also very inhomogeneous because the number of data , the photon noise , and systematic errors vary widely . )",
    "very slow variations ( 0.02 to 0.05 c / d ) without obvious instrumental or other explanations as artifacts , are wide - spread but can not always be related to more rapid variations .",
    "some time scales reach 30 - 40% of the time span of the data and need confirmation .",
    "with such a small number of examples , which may not all belong to the group to be defined , and incomplete information about most of them , the following compilation is not likely to fully survive critical scrutiny for long but may serve as a first guidance :      in most stars with spectroscopic mode identifications ( @xmath5 cen , @xmath2 cen , 28 cyg ) , the parent variations are retrograde quadrupole @xmath4-modes .",
    "the only counter example is hd 49330 with @xmath11 and @xmath21 .    in no star",
    "is the structure of the surface velocity field observationally constrained . for the understanding of the nature of @xmath0 frequencies it is of high interest to compare it to those of the parent variabilities ( which may also reside in the circumstellar disk ) .    in some stars , there is a mismatch at the @xmath221% level between inferred and calculated frequency differences .",
    "its significance is not clear , especially since some of the parent frequencies are members of broad frequency groups .",
    "amplitudes of @xmath0 frequencies can be both smaller or larger than those of their parent variabilities . only in @xmath5 cen",
    "is the amplitude of one @xmath0 frequency more than twice as large as the amplitude sum of the parent frequencies .          with the exception of 25 ori ,",
    "mplitude variations during outbursts are not well documented for @xmath0 frequencies . in wavelet transforms ( which are technically biased to such results )",
    ", @xmath0 frequencies may exhibit substantially less amplitude and phase wobble than other variations ( hd 186567 ) .      with mismatches in frequency of up to a few percent ,",
    "such coincidences may in stars with several base frequencies arise by chance in @xmath23% of all cases .",
    "however , if the amplitude is larger than those of the parent frequencies ( @xmath5 cen , @xmath2 cen ) or there are links to a variable star - to - disk mass - transfer rate ( @xmath2 cen , @xmath5 cen , 28 cyg ) , the false - alarm probability becomes negligible .",
    "that is , frequency differences as characterized above are real as a general phenomenon but individual examples may be spurious .    in pulsating stars , difference ( @xmath0 ) frequencies",
    "are a subset of combination frequencies , which comprise differences , sums , and mixed combinations of eigenfrequencies .",
    "they are known from white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rr lyrae stars , and @xmath20 scuti stars . in the rapidly rotating hybrid",
    "@xmath24 cep / spb star @xmath24 cen aa , the @xmath0 frequency 0.86 c / d has the highest amplitude of all detected variations ; for early - type stars in general see @xcite .",
    "the theoretical foundation for such nonlinear mode coupling was laid by @xcite . however , in be stars circumstellar processes may be involved , which would render the two phenomena incomparable .    as discussed by @xcite",
    ", rapid rotation adds an important extra twist : numerical relations between frequencies in the observer s frame do not necessarily hold in the corotating frame , especially considering the change of the latter implied by differential rotation .",
    "that is , either such numerical relations need to be looked at with much skepticism or they carry valuable diagnostic information . for instance , differential rotation may be one way to understand the observed imperfect frequency matches .",
    "perhaps , the nature of @xmath0 frequencies may also shed some light on the unexplained strong spectroscopic preponderance of retrograde modes in be stars .    in the context of possible pulsation - assisted mass loss",
    ", @xmath0 frequencies may be more relevant than sum frequencies because the much increased time scales may enable stronger deviations from adiabaticity .",
    "unfortunately , the repetition time scales of outbursts of most be stars are much longer than the lengths of photometric data strings that can be safely assumed to be free of long - term instrumental or other artifacts .",
    "more importantly , for a general explanation of outbursts by @xmath0 frequencies , they would need to be present in all be stars concerned . as an observational goal , this is still very far away .                                                ,",
