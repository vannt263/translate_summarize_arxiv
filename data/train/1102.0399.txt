    "the pressure map taken pre band gap formation clearly demonstrates that at low frequencies the sonic crystal system behaves as a homogeneous material and acoustic wave propagation is unaffected by the periodic structure .",
    "this is due to the lattice parameter being much smaller than the relevant wavelength .",
    "the pressure map at 8000 hz , in the centre of the band gap clearly shows band gap formation , with the wavelength of the incoming acoustic wave comparable to the lattice parameter . the acoustic wave is severely attenuated due to multiple scattering effects and a shadow zone",

    "the finite element transmission calculations give band gaps of larger width than those predicted by the band structure .",
    "this difference could be attributed to the finite number of scatterers used in the transmission simulations and the subsequent diffraction effects around the edges of the sonic crystal structure .",
    "the overall position of the band gaps are in good agreement with those of the band structure calculations .",
    "the conventional sonic crystal modelled with solid scattering inclusions form band gaps solely due to the periodicity in agreement with theory and our experiments @xcite . to operate below this bragg gap",
    "we now investigate a design of locally resonant sonic crystal ( lrsc ) which is an array of slotted cylinders .",
    "an advantage of using comsol multiphysics to compute acoustic band structure is the capability of modelling more complex scatterer geometries .",
    "similar to the conventional sonic crystal system modelled previously , periodic boundary conditions have been employed , see figure [ unitcellres ] .    again , by varying the wavevector in the first brillouin zone for the first ten eigenvalues ,",

    "the period is 22 mm .",
    "we call each resonating inclusion , a c - shaped resonator",
    ".     -0.5 mm    we note the appearance of a flat band in the band structure ( figure [ resband ] ) .",
    "modes associated with a flat band should have a group velocity equal to zero and exhibit strong spatial localisation . in practice ,",
    "such localised modes are often created by inserting a defect in a periodic structure , i.e. creating a cavity @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the acoustic resonance owing to the c - shaped inclusions leads to the appearance of this flat band , forming a complete acoustic band gap that is induced by the local acoustic resonance of each individual scatterer .",
    "the slotted tubes act analogous to helmholtz resonators and all have the same resonance frequency , @xmath34 = 4840 hz . the combined action of the resonators induces the degenerate state to form a band gap symmetrically around @xmath34 spanning 4190  5190 hz , centred at 4690 hz .",
    "-0.5 mm    due to the periodicity of the c - shaped lrsc , this structure still exhibits bragg band gaps , the first of which spans 6410  8550 hz .",
    "a further three bragg bands are present due to the fulfillment of the bragg condition located at 12525  14135 hz , 15400  17210 hz and 21050  22140 hz .",
    "the introduction of the extra , flat resonance band could lead to the construction of viable acoustic barriers in the low frequency regime , which offer sound attenuation in all crystal lattice planes .",
    "the flat band ( originating from the localised acoustic resonance seen in the band structure ) is a large anticrossing gap ; this is generally referred to as a hybridization gap in the context of sonic crystals @xcite .",

    "demonstrate the propagation of an acoustic plane wave through the c - shaped lrsc .",
    "similar to the conventional sonic crystal , at frequencies below the active frequency ( 3000 hz ) of the sonic crystal , the incoming wave propagates as if the system was a homogeneous medium .",
    "the computed pressure map taken at 4850 hz clearly shows that the c - shaped lrsc attenuates the wave in this region .",
    "the pressure map , see figure [ steelrespmap ] , indicates that regions of maximum pressure are localised to the inclusions , at the resonance frequency . in the higher frequency region , around 6500 hz ,",
    "the acoustic wave is free to propagate through the system . as we approach the bragg band gap frequency of 9000 hz",
    ", it is clear again to see the appearance of band gap type attenuation .",
    "looking at the pressure maps it becomes apparent that the two regions of attenuation appear to be controlled by two different mechanisms .",
    "-0.5 mm    in the transmission spectrum , see figure [ res25000 ] , additional attenuation peaks can be observed ( @xmath3520000 hz ) . if we compare the location of these peaks with the computed band structure , the peaks appear to be attributed to anticrossing regions present in the band structure . in general ,",
    "such gaps originate from level repulsion , when two bands of the same symmetry avoid crossing each other .",
    "the appearance of these anticrossing regions are beyond the scope of this investigation , but should be investigated further to enhance the performance of the c - shaped lrsc .",
    "the reader is directed toward a seminal paper by wu _",
    "@xcite detailing this phenomenological effect .",
    "the physical origin of these anticrossing gaps , is different when compared with those induced by the acoustic resonance .",
    "the flat band ( hybridisation gap ) originating from the acoustic resonance of the c - shape scatterer and regions corresponding to the anticrossing gaps that are formed due to the longitudinal displacement field in the homogeneous effective medium @xcite .",
    "the narrowness of the anticrossing gaps indicate that they are much weaker .",
    "the hybridization discussed is analogous to s - d hybridization in the energy band structure of transition metals , see for example harrison @xcite .",
    "the c - shaped tubes act as acoustic resonators which give rise to a single flat band that extends across all high symmetry directions and is located below the bragg gap .",
    "its position is dependent upon the cavity dimensions and is independent of the sonic crystal periodicity . for practical applications of sonic crystals as noise barriers it is desirable to be able to broaden the width of this resonance gap .",
    "one method to achieve this is to include multiple resonator sizes and ` overlap ' the individual resonance peaks .",
    "we have investigated mixed arrays that display this ability @xcite , however , in order to save space and reduce the overall barrier thickness we know propose a design of sonic crystal with resonators placed concentrically inside one another .",
    "we coin this the matryoshka ( russian doll ) configuration .",
    "specifically we investigate a matryoshka sonic crystal whose unit cell is defined with six concentric c - shaped resonators , all tuned to frequencies that lie within 200 hz of each other in the low frequency regime , ( see figure [ 6matunit ] ) .",
    "-0.5 mm    applying periodic boundary conditions , to replicate an infinite array of these matryoshka inclusions in a square array with lattice parameter @xmath19 = 15.5 mm , the acoustic band structure can be computed .",
    "the dimensions of each c - shaped resonator are designed so that they can be placed concentrically inside each other .",
    "the largest c - shaped resonator has an , external diameter = 22.5 mm , and an internal diameter = 14.1 mm with a slot width 11.3 mm .",
    "meanwhile the smallest of the nested resonators has an external diameter = 13.2 mm , and an internal diameter = 10.9 mm with a slot width 3.1 mm .",
    "figure [ 6matband ] presents the finite element computed band structure in all high symmetry directions .",
    "-0.5 mm    the band structure has been computed for the first ten eigenvalues , by varying the wave vector in the first brillouin zone .",
    "it can be seen that a matryoshka system , with many individual resonating units , induces the formation of multiple band gaps . due to the periodic nature of these inclusions",
    ", this sonic crystal system possesses the characteristic bragg band gaps , although it is hard to identify which bands are attributed to the separate band gap formation mechanisms . a conventional sonic crystal system with a lattice parameter @xmath19 = 15.5 mm should possess a bragg band gap around 1120  1360 hz , therefore the other band gaps present in the band structure must be caused by the acoustic resonance of each c - shaped inclusion .",
    "it is can be seen that the induced resonance band gaps are complete acoustic band gaps , inhibiting wave propagation across all lattice planes , without the need for a large packing fraction as found with the characteristic bragg band gap .",
    "-0.5 mm    for completeness , finite element methods have been employed to obtain a transmission spectrum for this array .",
    "a 10 @xmath36 10 array of the matryoshka inclusions ( each containing six concentric c - shaped resonators ) is described in comsol .",
    "the spectrum extends to 2000 hz , and demonstrates the appearance of multiple regions of attenuation , owing to the individual resonances of the six c - shaped resonators as well as a bragg band gap .",
    "the first attenuation band is caused by the individual resonance of the largest diameter resonating inclusion , spanning 400  600 hz .",
    "five more regions of attenuation can be seen spanning , 600  740 hz , 740  880 hz , 880  1120 hz , 1120 hz  1360 hz and 1360  1500 hz .",
    "figure [ 6matpress ] presents the corresponding pressure diagrams computed in the region of each band gap present in the frequency spectrum .",
    "it can be seen that each individual resonator experiences an increase in pressure inside the cavity , caused by the acoustic resonance of each c - shaped inclusion .",
    "this allows us to confirm the band gap formation mechanism that is responsible for each region of attenuation present in the frequency spectrum .",
    "-0.5 mm    for comparison , figure [ 6matcomp ] shows both the finite element computed band structure , limited to the @xmath11 direction , and the computed frequency spectrum .",
    "the frequencies at which the band gaps occur in the band structure are in good agreement with the regions of attenuation present in the transmission spectrum .",
    "a small attenuation band is present in the transmission spectrum at around 1700 hz . at the corresponding frequency in the band structure",
    ", an anticrossing region appears , induced by the level repulsion effect .",
    "since the resonances are very close in frequency to the frequency that satisfies the bragg condition , the two band gap regimes appear to overlap in this matryoshka sonic crystal .",
    "resonance scattering occurring in the same frequency range as bragg scattering favours the formation of broad band gaps .",
    "the proposed matryoshka sonic crystal offers a viable solution to overcome the inherent dependence on spacing experienced with conventional sonic crystal designs .",
    "it has been discovered that such systems can form multiple resonance band gaps in the lower frequency region , below that of bragg formation .",
    "these resonance bands can be combined to form broad regions of attenuation , either by selecting close acoustic resonances or further by tuning the structure to combine the characteristic bragg band gap with the resonance band gaps .",
    "the proposed six shell matryoshka design is particularly suited for noise barrier applications . although road traffic noise is essentially broad band in nature ( due to a large number of very different vehicles that move at different velocities ) , it often has a defined maximum frequency .",
    "a study by sandberg @xcite found that a multi - coincidence peak in the tyre - noise spectra is observed around 1000 hz .",
    "the simulation results obtained using a six shell concentric matryoshka system demonstrates the active frequency range spans 400  1600 hz , providing decent levels of attenuation across this range .",
