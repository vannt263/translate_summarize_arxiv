    "the significant and continuous development of the chirped - pulse amplification technique @xcite has intrigued many researches in the high field science with rich nonlinear features @xcite .",
    "particularly the laser - matter interaction has also provided the possibility to achieve the advanced x - ray sources .",
    "various schemes have been proposed and developed for the compact and tunable x - ray sources , for example , the high harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite , the thomson and compton scattering @xcite and the free electron laser ( fel ) @xcite and so on .",
    "the generation of x rays by the thomson scattering , i.e. , the scattering spectrum produced by the relativistic electron in the high - intensity laser field , exhibits the rich structure and even irregular distribution characteristic .",
    "several studies @xcite about the thomson - scattering are focused on the characteristics of spectrum dependence of an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "the external magnetic field not only confines the transverse motion of the electron but also distorts the laser field so that the resonance absorption of emission @xcite occurs .",
    "most of former researches have been based on the assumption that the frequency of harmonic radiation is an integer multiple of the laser frequency , however , this assumption is not valid when the laser field as well an external magnetic field are both presented .",
    "actually the perspective of the laser - magnetic resonance acceleration @xcite tells us that the relativistic cyclotron motion will occur in transverse direction under an external magnetic field",
    ". this cyclotron - resonance motion will affect the frequency of emission .",
    "for example the authors in ref.@xcite demonstrates that the electron will emit radiation at high harmonics of the cyclotron frequency in the plane of the electron cyclotron orbit . beside ,",
    "when the cyclotron - resonance condition is met , i.e. , the cyclotron frequency approaches to the laser frequency , the periodic motion electron makes would result in that the fundamental frequency of harmonic emission is neither the laser frequency nor the cyclotron frequency for the backscattered thomson spectra @xcite .",
    "evenly the impact of cyclotron - resonance degree of the electron motion upon the radiation spectrum can be adjusted by changing the electron orbit .",
    "since the phenomena of thomson scattering spectra of moving electron in the combined laser - magnetic fields are very rich and highly nonlinear and some influences of factors are not included in previous researches , on the other hand , motivated by the advantage of electron resonance acceleration in laser field assisted by the external magnetic field in our previous study @xcite , we study the involved thomson scattering in presence of laser and magnetic field .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the motion of the electron in circularly polarized laser - plane wave and static magnetic field .",
    "different from the former works @xcite , our analytic solution of the motion equation indicates that the electron makes the strict periodic motion , therefore , the fundamental frequency of harmonic radiation would be affected by the combination of factors which include the period of the electron motion , the direction of observation and the electron orbit rather than only the laser frequency or the cyclotron - resonance frequency studied in ref.@xcite . on the other hand , it is found that the fundamental frequency of harmonic emission is independent of the initial phase of the electron with respect to the laser field , this point is contrast to the work by he @xcite . by the way the magnetic resonance parameter defined in magnetic resonance acceleration , see our previous work @xcite , which plays an important role in our studied problem , is used to present the relationship between the degree of cyclotron resonance and the emission spectra .",
    "the main finding of the present work is the scale invariance of the backward scattering spectrum on the basis of integer harmonic orders especially the laser intensity and the magnetic resonance parameter are used as scale parameters in highly cyclotron resonance cases . by the theoretical analysis and numerical results ,",
    "the scaling laws of magnetic resonance parameter as well the initial axial momentum are found and its implications are discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ basic ] , the momentum and trajectory of the electron in the circularly laser - plane field and constant external magnetic field are derived from the parametric equations of the normalized laser intensity , the magnetic resonance parameter and the phase of the electron .",
    "the energy of the electron is also given in the parametric form .",
    "the feature of the radiation spectrum via the analytic formula is given . in sec .",
    "[ numeric ] , the backscattered spectrum is obtained numerically and compared with analytic results in previous section .",
    "our main conclusions and a brief discussion will be given in the final section .",

    "we normalize time by @xmath19 , velocity by @xmath17 and distance by @xmath20 .",
    "the potential and magnetic field are measured by dimensionless parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .      since that an electron moves in constant circularly laser light , the constant of motion is readily obtained as @xmath23 . from eqs .",
