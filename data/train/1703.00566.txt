    "the solar wind ( sw ) emerging from the sun is the main driving mechanism of solar events which may lead to geomagnetic storms which are the primary causes of space weather disturbances that affect the magnetic environment of earth and may have hazardous effects on the space - borne and ground - based technological systems as well as human health .",
    "therefore , accurate modeling of the sw is very important to understand the underlying mechanisms of such storms .",
    "as the number of space - borne and ground - based observatories increased significantly over the past decades , a number of data - driven models of sw that involve formulations of time - dependent boundary conditions ( bcs ) that incorporate remote and _ in situ _ observations of the sun in a self - consistent way have been developed ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the sw emerges from the sun . in order to model the background sw in a physically - consistent way ,",
    "it is essential to apply a proper boundary treatment based on observational data on the sun . for this purpose",
    ", we have developed a data - driven magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model of the global solar corona which applies characteristically - consistent bcs at the inner boundary of our computational domain located in the lower solar corona .",
    "our characteristic bc formulation follows  @xcite , is _ entirely based on observations , and does not rely on any non - reflection principle , as in _",
    "it allows us to specify sufficient number of _ mathematically admissible _ bcs .",
    "the implementation of characteristic bcs at the lower corona is based not only on the knowledge of how many quantities should be specified , but also on the requirement that time - increments of quantities that are specified as physical bcs should be uniquely expressible in terms of the increments of proper characteristic variables .    with the availability of vector magnetograms and surface velocity components",
    ", we can impose our characteristic bc formulation to obtain a realistic time - dependent background sw model .",
    "our model is driven by solar dynamics observatory / helioseismic and magnetic imager ( _ sdo / hmi _ ) synoptic vector magnetograms together with the horizontal velocity data in the photosphere obtained , e.g. , with the time - distance helioseismology method  @xcite .",
    "in addition , our model can also be driven by other observational data including the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetogram data obtained by _ hmi _ , solar and heliospheric observatory / michelson doppler imager ( _ soho / mdi _ ) , national solar observatory / global oscillation network group ( _ nso / gong _ ) , and wilcox solar observatory ( _ wso _ ) .",
    "we obtain the initial distribution of plasma properties in the computational domain from the potential field source surface ( pfss ) model  @xcite for the magnetic field and parker s 1d isothermal sw model  @xcite for the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "we model the sw acceleration by introducing volumetric heating source terms into the momentum and energy equations that incorporate expansion factors to take the coronal magnetic field distribution into account  @xcite .",
    "we have implemented our model in the multi - scale fluid - kinetic simulation suite ( ms - flukss )  @xcite  a suite of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) codes designed to solve the coupled systems of mhd , gas dynamics euler , and kinetic boltzmann equations  @xcite .",
    "ms - flukss is built upon the chombo amr framework developed at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "ms - flukss also has modules that treat pickup ions as a separate fluid and turbulence beyond the alfvnic surface .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we will present an overview of our global solar corona model with particular emphasis given to our characteristic bc formulation and _ sdo / hmi _ vector magnetogram and horizontal velocity data . in section  [ sec3",
    "] , we will present results we obtained using our model .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] , we will present our conclusions .",
    "we solve the set of ideal mhd equations with volumetric heating source terms to model acceleration of sw  @xcite .",
    "they are written in terms of conservative variables , in conservation - law form as follows :    @xmath0 + \\mathbf{{s}_{m } } \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\rho\\mathbf{v}\\cdot[\\mathbf{g}+(\\mathbf{\\omega}\\times\\mathbf{r})\\times\\mathbf{\\omega } ] + s_{e } \\end{array } \\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the density , velocity , magnetic field , thermal pressure , specific total energy of the plasma , and gravitational acceleration , respectively .",
    "the source terms in the momentum and energy conservation equations include the coriolis and centrifugal forces which are present when the system is solved in a frame corotating with the sun .",
    "accordingly , @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to the angular velocity of the sun and position vector , respectively .    in order to model the acceleration of the sw , we introduce a volumetric heating source term , @xmath9 , into the energy conservation equation , and the corresponding source term , @xmath10 , into the conservation of momentum equations  @xcite .",
    "they are given as follows :    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the model constants given as @xmath17 , @xmath18 n @xmath19 , and @xmath20 j @xmath19@xmath21 .",
    "additionally , @xmath22 is the expansion factor by which a magnetic flux tube expands in solid angle between its footpoint location on the photosphere and the source surface which is typically at @xmath23  @xcite :    @xmath24    these source terms take the coronal magnetic field topology into account by incorporating the expansion factor .",
    "the expansion factor is initially computed in every cell located between the inner boundary and the source surface and kept constant throughout a simulation .",
    "our model is primarily driven by full disk _ hmi _",
    "synoptic vector magnetograms  @xcite and horizontal velocity data in the photosphere .",
    "@xcite provides full disk vector magnetogram data with high cadence ( @xmath25 720 s ) and no data gaps  @xcite . from these data , synoptic",
    "vector magnetograms are computed for each carrington rotation for the entire _ sdo _  @xcite mission .",
    "they have a resolution of 3600@xmath261440 pixels and are provided by the _ joint science operations center _ ( jsoc ) under the data series name hmi.b_synoptic  @xcite .",
    "the horizontal velocity data are inferred by the time - distance helioseismology method  @xcite .",
    "the acoustic travel times are measured using _ hmi _",
    "dopplergram observations under the data series name hmi.v and this method infers solar interior properties by inverting these measurements .",
    "thus , near - real time full disk maps of subsurface wave - speed perturbations and horizontal flow velocities are produced for depths ranging from 0 to 20 , every 8 hours .",
    "carrington synoptic maps for the subsurface properties are made from these full disk maps .",
    "these maps have a resolution of 3000@xmath261000@xmath266 pixels where the last dimension corresponds to the depth beneath the solar surface .",
    "we utilize the corresponding data on the photosphere .    in figures",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , three components of the magnetic field vector and horizontal velocity components are shown on the solar surface corresponding to carrington rotation ( cr ) 2145 , respectively .",
    "the horizontal velocity profiles are given within the latitude range of @xmath27 .",
    "above this latitude , the inferred velocity is not very reliable .",
    "+            our model can also be driven by other observational data including _ nso / gong _ , _ hmi _ , _ soho / mdi _ , and _ wso _ los magnetogram data .",
    "we calculate the initial distribution of magnetic field using the pfss model  @xcite based either on the spherical harmonics approach  @xcite or a finite difference method by incorporating the solution provided by the finite difference iterative potential - field solver ( fdips ) code  @xcite into ms - flukss .",
    "fdips is a good alternative to the spherical harmonics approach .",
    "as the number of spherical harmonics increases , using raw magnetogram data specified on a grid that is uniform in the sine of latitude can result in inaccurate and unreliable results , especially in the polar regions close to the sun .",
    "as the fdips code accepts any magnetogram data represented in the flexible image transport system ( fits ) file format as input , we can also incorporate potential magnetic field solutions for all such data into ms - flukss .",
    "for the rest of the plasma parameters , we compute the _ initial solution _ from parker s isothermal sw model  @xcite .      one of the important components of our data - driven mhd model is a genuinely characteristic bc formulation , which became possible only recently because of the availability of vector magnetograms .",
    "if the inner simulation boundary is in the vicinity of the photosphere ( @xmath28 ) , the radial component of the sw velocity is likely to be less than the alfvn or even slow magnetosonic velocity .",
    "not only this determines the number of physical bcs at @xmath28 , but the characteristic variables to be specified are also uniquely defined . since there are no analytic expressions for characteristic variables in mhd , they can not be found from observational data . on the other hand ,",
    "any admissible set of physical bcs should be resolvable for the above - mentioned physical characteristic variables",
    ". the remaining bcs should be mathematical ( numerical ) .",
    "they should be specified , e.g. , by extrapolation of the corresponding variables from inside the computational region .",
    "this approach is widely applied in aerodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "consider the system of governing equations written in terms of the so - called primitive variables ( the abbreviations are conventional ) .",
    "@xmath29    assuming spherical coordinates for definiteness , we rewrite this system in the quasilinear form as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the vector of primitive variables , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the coefficient matrices in front of the @xmath35- , @xmath36- , and @xmath37-derivatives , respectively , and @xmath38 is the source term vector involving the gravitational force , spherical geometrical factors , and volumetric heating terms .",
    "let @xmath39 . then , eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes @xmath40    to write out a set of compatibility relations , we multiply the above equation by the left eigenvector matrix of @xmath32  @xcite : @xmath41 or in the component form ( note that @xmath42 ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the rows of the left eigenvector matrix @xmath46 and eigenvalues of @xmath32 , respectively .    on introducing a set of characteristic variables @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 , we obtain a diagonal system ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 no analytic expressions for @xmath47 exist in mhd , but their increments are well defined .    at the inner ( sw entrance ) boundary , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) corresponding to @xmath53 ( incoming characteristics )",
    "should be specified as physical bcs , whereas the bcs for remaining characteristic variables should be numerical ( i.e. , they should be derived from the characteristic compatibility relations for @xmath54 with @xmath55 for @xmath56 ) . for mhd equations , @xmath57 .    following this mathematical principle",
    ", we split the compatibility relations ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ) into two sets corresponding to the physical ( _ p _ ) and numerical ( _ n _ ) bcs :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are comprised of the characteristic variables and left eigenvectors corresponding to incoming and outgoing characteristics , respectively , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the primitive variables to be physically imposed or numerically determined .",
    "the physical bcs are implemented by setting    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the vector of time dependent variations of the primitive variables that are physically imposed . at each time step , @xmath63 values are interpolated in time using successive observational data ( e.g. , vector magnetogram ) with the chosen order of accuracy .",
    "keeping in mind eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) in terms of the primitive variables :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is a matrix of size @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "let us define @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "after making necessary substitutions , the set of primitive variables at the inner boundary can be determined from    @xmath76    it should be noted that our bcs are evolutionary ( i.e. , small changes in them lead to small changes in solution , see  @xcite ) , iff the left eigenvector matrix of the split system , @xmath77 , is non - singular .",
    "this determines the set of admissible physical bcs in terms of the primitive variables .",
    "it follows from our analysis that for realistic inflow condition only the plasma density and the radial component of magnetic field should always be specified as physical bcs .",
    "the choice of other physical bcs in terms of the primitive variables depends on the availability of appropriate measurements .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] describes reasonable choices , as well as the number of physical and numerical bcs .",
    ".different ways to specify the characteristic bcs .",
    "the slow magnetosonic , alfvnic , and fast magnetosonic velocities are denoted as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus , it can be seen that _",
    "sdo / hmi _ data allow us to specify the necessary bcs , except for density .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite that underestimating or overestimating density at the inner boundary does not affect the coronal solution .",
    "hence , we can assume uniform density at the inner boundary since we do not have measurements .",
    "we discretize our characteristic compatibility equations ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ) using tvd , roe - type schemes . for the components of the vector magnetogram and horizontal velocity data which can be imposed as physical bcs ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , the data values are imposed at the boundary surface and they are used in combination with values in the first and second layers of inner cells to extrapolate the primitive variables into the first and second ghost cell layers , respectively . since our characteristic bc formulation is in inertial reference frame , the synoptic maps for vector magnetogram and horizontal velocity data are also rotated taking the solar rotation into account . for the rest of the variables ,",
    "their time variation is determined by solving characteristic compatibility equations ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ) in the ghost cells .",
    "these equations involve spatial derivatives of plasma variables which are solved by finite difference approximations taking into account the plasma parameter values in the first and second inner and ghost cell layers .",
    "we present the results of a benchmark test that we performed to validate our characteristic bc formulations . in this test",
    ", we impose a dipole magnetic field with magnetic dipole moment equal to the solar dipole moment , @xmath81 n m @xmath82 , and parker s isothermal sw model as initial conditions for the magnetic field and hydrodynamic plasma parameters , respectively .",
    "then , we relax this configuration to a quasi - steady state using our characteristic bcs .",
    "we also performed another simulation with exactly the same grid , numerical schemes and initial conditions , but this time , using a set of non - characteristic bcs ( i.e. , @xmath83 @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , while @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath4 have zero derivative in the radial direction ) instead .",
    "notice that both sets of bcs have the same physical bcs corresponding to the subslow inflow case in table  [ tab1 ] , whereas the rest of the variables are either obtained from the compatibility equations or their radial derivatives are assumed to be zero .",
    "the comparison of the obtained solutions is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the computational domain has a span of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the computational grid is 128@xmath2656@xmath2640 in @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions , respectively , and is radially stretched .",
    "we use a tvd , roe - type scheme and forward euler method for spatial and temporal discretizations , respectively .",
    "the @xmath93 constraint is enforced following  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , dipole magnetic field lines that relaxed to a quasi - steady state are shown together with the plasma flow speed contours using characteristic and non - characteristic bcs .",
