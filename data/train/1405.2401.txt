    "it is a challenging task to construct a @xmath0-field generated by , say , four arbitrary subsets and to know its exact cardinality .",

    "then the cardinality of @xmath3 ( also called cardinality of the continuum ) is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cardinality of @xmath6 the set of natural numbers .",
    "one of the fascinating results in measure theory is that there is no @xmath0-field whose cardinality is countably infinite .",
    "in other words , the cardinality of a @xmath0-field can be either finite or equal to @xmath7 ( uncountable ) ( billingsley ( 1995 ) , p.  34 ) .",
    "our focus is on the cardinality of a @xmath0-field , generated by a finite class of @xmath8 sets , and to show that it assumes only particular values within a fixed range . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this problem has been addressed only for some special cases ( ash and doleans - dade ( 2000 ) , p.  11 ) .",
    "several typical examples are discussed to bring out the nature of the finitely generated @xmath0-fields .",
    "an algorithm to find the exact cardinality of some specific @xmath0-fields of interest is also presented .",
    "finally , we discuss an application to statistics with regard to the independence of some events and establish some new results in this direction .",

    "let @xmath1 be the given space , and consider two distinct subsets @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath1 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 we henceforth suppress the intersection symbol @xmath13 , unless the context demands it .",
    "for instance , @xmath14 will be denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0-field generated by the class @xmath16 denoted by @xmath17 , is obtained by the usual operations of complementations , unions and intersections , as @xmath18 let @xmath19 denote the partition ( see definition [ 2.2 ] ) of @xmath1 induced by @xmath9 and @xmath20 the elements of the @xmath0-field generated by a partition consist of the empty set @xmath21 , the sets in the partition and all possible ( finite ) unions of them . the resulting class is evidently closed under complementation .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-field generated by @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 as some unions in ( [ eqn2.1 ] ) admit simple forms which can be obtained using de morgan s laws .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath24 note that @xmath25    consider next the case when @xmath26 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 here .",
    "thus , when @xmath26 also , we have @xmath24 + consider next the cardinality of @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath29 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary subsets of @xmath30 two cases arise : ( i ) @xmath31 and ( ii ) @xmath32 + case ( i ) : if @xmath33 then @xmath34 . if @xmath35 then @xmath36 or @xmath37 ( if @xmath38 ) or @xmath39 ( if @xmath40 ) .",

    "+ it is of interest to know the cardinality of the partition based on @xmath8 arbitrary sets . to answer the question , we first introduce the following formal definitions .
