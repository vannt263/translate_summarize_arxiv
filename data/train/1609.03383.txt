    "nd - fe - b - based nanocomposite permanent magnets , which consist of exchange - coupled nanocrystalline hard ( @xmath3 ) and soft ( @xmath4-@xmath1 or @xmath5 ) magnetic phases , are of potential interest for electronic devices due to their preeminent magnetic properties such as high remanence and magnetic energy product @xcite .",
    "the major challenge remains the understanding of how the details of the microstructure ( e.g. , average particle size and shape , volume fraction of soft phase , texture , interfacial chemistry ) correlate with their magnetic properties . in order to tackle this issue a multiscale characterization approach",
    "is adopted , which comprises a suite of both experimental and theoretical state - of - the - art methods such as high - resolution electron microscopy , electron backscattering diffraction , three - dimensional atom - probe analysis , lorentz and kerr microscopy , or atomistic and continuum micromagnetic simulations .",
    "recent investigations by liu _",
    "_ @xcite and sepehri - amin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the properties of the interface regions between the @xmath3 grains decisively determine the coercivity of the sample .",
    "the grain - boundary layers ( and triple - junctions between the grains ) have a thickness between about @xmath6 and can be both in a crystalline or amorphous state .",
    "moreover , as far as their magnetism is concerned , the intergranular regions are characterized by different magnetic interactions ( exchange , magnetocrystalline anisotropy , saturation magnetization ) as compared to the @xmath3 crystallites and , hence , they represent potential sources for the nucleation of inhomogeneous spin textures during magnetization reversal .",
    "indeed , the micromagnetic simulation results reported in @xcite suggest that the existence of a thin ( @xmath7 ) ferromagnetic grain - boundary phase with reduced magnetocrystalline anisotropy , exchange - stiffness constant , and saturation magnetization causes the magnetization reversal to occur from the soft intergranular phase into the hard @xmath3 phase at a field of @xmath8 . when the intergranular phase is nonmagnetic , then the nucleation of reversed domains starts from the triple junctions of the @xmath3 grains at a higher field of @xmath9 .",
    "in this context it also worth noting that first - principles density functional theory calculations on an exchange - spring multilayer system @xcite predict a dependency of the exchange coupling on the crystallographic orientation at the interface between @xmath3 and @xmath4-@xmath1 ; specifically , ferromagnetic coupling is predicted for the @xmath10@xmath4-@xmath11 interface model , whereas antiferromagnetic interactions are obtained for @xmath12@xmath4-@xmath13 .",
    "if this prediction were true , then it may negatively influence the magnetic properties of this class of materials ( e.g. , the maximum energy product ) .",
    "indeed , a recent experimental study using ferromagnetic resonance and kerr microscopy @xcite reports on the predicted negative exchange coupling .    the above discussed examples ultimately demonstrate that the magnetic microstructure of nanocrystalline nd - fe - b - based magnets is characterized by inhomogeneous magnetization structures and that interfacial regions are a major cause for the nanoscale spin disorder .",
    "in addition to the grain boundaries , there exist , however , other sources of spin disorder in such materials : ultrafine - grained textured nanocomposites are produced from melt - spun ribbons via hot compaction @xcite ; this process may introduce crystal defects which locally act as nucleation centers for nonuniform magnetization textures .",
    "furthermore , one has to invoke a magnetization inhomogeneity which is due to the nonideal alignment ( dispersion ) of the crystallographic @xmath14-axes ( of the @xmath3 grains ) along the pressing direction during hot deformation ; the spins have to undergo rotations in order to accommodate to the changes in the easy - axis magnetization direction from grain to grain .",
    "last but not least , there is the magnetic shape anisotropy of the usually platelet - shaped @xmath3 particles , which may result in a small spin canting towards the plane perpendicular to the @xmath14-axis .",
    "it is certainly true that the magnetic anisotropy field of the @xmath3 phase ( about @xmath15 at @xmath16 @xcite ) is much larger than any shape - anisotropy field ( assuming , e.g. , @xmath17 for strongly anisotropic grains ) , but nevertheless weak spin canting ( @xmath18 ) might be produced by the competition between shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy .    in order to scrutinize the above - sketched issue , we have carried out a comparative study of the magnetic microstructure of textured ( hot - deformed ) and isotropic nanocrystalline @xmath0-@xmath1 by means of magnetic small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) .",
    "specifically , the central aim of our investigation is to detect and quantify the presumed nanoscale spin disorder , which is commonly only indirectly inferred by combining results from electron microscopy , magnetization , and micromagnetic simulations .    the sans technique ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) provides information on variations of both the magnitude and orientation of the magnetization on a nanometer length scale ( @xmath19  nm ) .",
    "sans is extremely sensitive to long - wavelength magnetization fluctuations and it has only recently been employed for characterizing nd - fe - b - based permanent magnets : for example , the field dependence of characteristic magnetic length scales during the magnetization - reversal process in isotropic nd - fe - b - based nanocomposites @xcite and in isotropic sintered nd - fe - b @xcite was studied , the exchange - stiffness constant has been determined @xcite , the observation of the so - called spike anisotropy in the magnetic sans cross section has been explained with the formation of flux - closure patterns @xcite , magnetic multiple scattering has been detected @xcite , textured nd - fe - b has been investigated @xcite , and the effect of grain - boundary diffusion on the magnetization - reversal process of isotropic @xcite and hot - deformed textured @xcite nanocrystalline nd - fe - b magnets has been studied .",
    "two @xmath0-@xmath1 nanocomposites containing , respectively , @xmath20 of fe were investigated in this study .",
    "both samples were prepared by means of the melt - spinning technique .",
    "one sample was subsequently hot - deformed in order to obtain a textured magnet .",
    "for this purpose , the melt - spun ribbons were crushed into powders of a few hundred micrometers in size and then sintered at @xmath21 under a pressure of @xmath22 .",
    "the sintered bulk was hot - deformed with a height reduction of about @xmath23 to develop the [ 001 ] texture of the @xmath3 phase along the pressing direction @xcite .",
    "this results in the formation of platelet - shaped @xmath3 grains with an average thickness of @xmath24 and an average diameter of @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath3 platelets are stacked along the nominal @xmath14-axis , which we define as the [ 001 ] direction , with some degrees of misorientation .",
    "the isotropic sample had an average grain size of about @xmath26 .",
    "we have also investigated composites with @xmath27 and @xmath28 of fe , which , as far as the neutron results are concerned , show qualitatively the same behavior as the @xmath20 sample . for further details ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the neutron experiment has been carried out at @xmath16 at the instrument sans - i at the paul scherrer institute , switzerland , using unpolarized neutrons with a mean wavelength of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( fwhm ) @xcite . the external magnetic field @xmath31 ( provided by a cryomagnet ; @xmath32 ) was applied perpendicular and parallel to the wave vector @xmath33 of the incoming neutron beam ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; this corresponds to the situation that @xmath31 is parallel ( @xmath34 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath35 ) to the nominal @xmath14-axis ( pressing direction ) of the textured sample .",
    "neutron data were corrected for background scattering ( empty sample holder ) , transmission , and detector efficiency using the grasp software package .",
    "the measured transmission was larger than @xmath36 for both samples at all fields investigated .",
    "further sample characterization was done by means of vibrating sample magnetometry , transmission electron microscopy , and synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( at beamline bl04-mspd at the alba synchrotron , barcelona , spain @xcite ) .",
    "sketch of the perpendicular ( a ) and parallel ( b ) scattering geometry , which , respectively , have the applied magnetic field @xmath31 perpendicular and parallel to the wave vector @xmath33 of the incident neutron beam ; @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the scattering angle and @xmath39 is the mean neutron wavelength .",
    "note that @xmath40 in _ both _ geometries and that @xmath41 for @xmath34 ( a ) and @xmath42 for @xmath35 ( b ) .",
    "the pressing direction is horizontal , which is along @xmath43 in ( a ) and along @xmath44 in ( b ) . ]",
    "the elastic unpolarized sans cross section @xmath45 at momentum - transfer vector @xmath46 takes on different forms depending on the relative orientation between the wave vector @xmath33 of the incident neutron beam and the externally applied magnetic field @xmath31 @xcite ; for the perpendicular geometry ( @xmath34 ) , we obtain @xmath47 whereas for the parallel case ( @xmath35 ) @xmath48 @xmath49 denotes the scattering volume , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the nuclear scattering amplitude , and @xmath52 represents the fourier transform of the magnetization @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is a quantity complex - conjugated to @xmath14 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the magnetization vector field of a bulk ferromagnet is a function of the position @xmath55 inside the material , i.e. , @xmath56 , and that , consequently , @xmath57 .",
    "however , the fourier components which appear in the above sans cross sections represent projections into the @xmath58-@xmath59-plane for @xmath34 ( @xmath60 ) and into the @xmath61-@xmath58-plane for @xmath35 ( @xmath62 ) ( compare fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in polar coordinates ,",
    "the @xmath63 then depend ( in addition to the applied field and the magnetic interactions ) on both the magnitude @xmath64 and the orientation @xmath65 of the scattering vector @xmath46 @xcite .    in our neutron data analysis",
    "below , we subtract the respective sans signal at the largest available field of @xmath66 ( approach - to - saturation regime , compare fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) from the measured data at lower fields .",
    "this subtraction procedure eliminates the nuclear sans contribution ( @xmath67 ) , which is field independent , and it yields the so - called spin - misalignment sans cross section @xmath68 , which we display here for simplicity only for the parallel scattering geometry : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( and so on for the other fourier coefficients ) represents the difference between the value of @xmath71 at the actual field @xmath72 and the measurement at @xmath66 [ @xmath73 ) ] . if it would be possible to fully saturate the sample ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) and if one restricts the considerations ( subtraction procedure ) to the approach - to - saturation regime , where the field dependence of the longitudinal fourier component can be neglected ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , then @xmath68 ( for @xmath35 ) reduces to @xmath76 and likewise for the @xmath34 geometry .",
    "furthermore , it is decisive for the later discussion to note that for a ferromagnet with a statistically - isotropic microstructure the parallel total ( nuclear and magnetic ) @xmath45 and @xmath68 [ eqs .",
    "( [ sigmatotpara ] ) and ( [ sigmasmpara ] ) ] are generally _ isotropic _ , i.e. , @xmath65-independent ( see , e.g. , fig .  21 in ref .",

    ".  ( [ sigmatotpara ] ) and ( [ sigmasmpara ] ) are isotropic for a statistically - isotropic ferromagnet ; this is not true for the perpendicular geometry [ eq .",
    "( [ sigmatotperp ] ) ] , which generally exhibits a pronounced angular anisotropy .",
    "the ( normalized ) correlation function @xmath78 of the spin misalignment can be computed from azimuthally - averaged data via @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the zeroth - order bessel function .",
    "analysis of @xmath78 provides information on the characteristic magnetic length scales @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the room - temperature magnetization curves of textured [ fig .",

    "[ fig2](b ) ] @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "the coercive fields are @xmath81 ( textured ) and @xmath82 ( isotropic ) .",
    "the saturation polarization was estimated by extrapolating the data to infinite field : we find @xmath83 ( textured ) and @xmath84 ( isotropic ) with ensuing remanence - to - saturation ratios of about @xmath85 ( textured easy ) , @xmath86 ( textured hard ) , and @xmath87 ( isotropic ) .",
    "consistent with the magnetization data , the transmission electron microscopy images of the textured sample [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) ] reveal a weakly anisotropic microstructure , while the isotropic sample [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ] exhibits equiaxed grains .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements carried out ( in transmission mode ) at the alba synchrotron ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) unambiguously prove the presence of a weak texture along the ( horizontal ) pressing direction ; specifically , diffraction peaks of the type @xmath88 do present two maxima around @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the debye scherrer rings .",
    "additionally , we find evidence for the presence of texture along other crystallographic directions ; peaks of the type @xmath91 exhibit two maxima around @xmath92 and @xmath93 . this latter observation will be of relevance when discussing the results of the magnetic neutron data analysis ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] depicts ( for @xmath35 ) the two - dimensional unpolarized total scattering cross sections @xmath45 of the textured and isotropic nd - fe - b - based nanocomposites at selected applied magnetic fields ( @xmath66 , remanence , coercive field ) . the isotropic sample [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] exhibits an isotropic scattering pattern at all fields investigated , whereas the textured sample [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] shows anisotropic scattering with an elongation along the horizontal direction .",
    "the corresponding ( over @xmath94 ) azimuthally - averaged data sets are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ; between the coercive field and the largest available field of @xmath66 , the cross section of the isotropic sample changes ( roughly ) by about an order of magnitude at the smallest momentum - transfers @xmath64 ( and about half an order of magnitude for the textured sample ) .            while the textured nanocomposite reveals a power - law type scattering over most of the @xmath64-range , the isotropic sample exhibits a more structured @xmath45 with significant curvature at lower and medium @xmath64 .",
    "this difference in @xmath45 is most likely related to the difference in the average grain sizes and the ensuing magnetization fluctuations on a nanometer length scale : the isotropic sample has an average grain size of @xmath95 , while the textured nd - fe - b possesses a larger particle size of the order of @xmath96 ( compare the tem images in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we also note that the @xmath45 of both samples ( data not shown ) as well as the spin - misalignment sans cross section @xmath68 [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] are characterized by power - law exponents @xmath97 that are larger than @xmath98 .",
    "this is in agreement with the notion of spin - misalignment scattering , i.e. , scattering due to canted spins with a characteristic magnetic - field - dependent wavelength @xcite .",
    "it is also quite obvious from this observation that the corresponding magnetization fluctuations in real space are not exponentially correlated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] below ) .    as discussed previously , for @xmath35 , any anisotropy of @xmath45 ( or of @xmath68 )",
    "is indicative of an anisotropic microstructure . at magnetic _ saturation",
    "_ , the _ total _ sans signal arises from nanoscale spatial fluctuations in the nuclear density and in the saturation magnetization @xmath99 , presumably at internal @xmath0-@xmath1 interfaces .",
    "the nuclear scattering - length density contrast between the @xmath3 phase and the @xmath4-fe phase amounts to @xmath100 , whereas  at saturation  the magnetic contrast can be estimated as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 denotes the difference in saturation magnetization between @xmath4-fe ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath104 ) . by assuming that the elements of the microstructure which give rise to nuclear scattering @xmath105 are identical to those which give rise to longitudinal magnetic scattering @xmath106 , one finds for a saturated sample that the ratio of nuclear to magnetic sans equals @xmath107 .",
    "with reference to the electron - microscopy results ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , which reveal a ( weakly ) anisotropic grain shape ( aspect ratio @xmath108 ) , it is then obvious that a ( weakly ) horizontally - elongated sans pattern can already be generated _ at saturation _ by the combined action of the nuclear and longitudinal magnetic form factors .     selected results for the spin - misalignment sans cross section @xmath68 of the textured and isotropic @xmath0-@xmath1 nanocomposite for @xmath35 [ ( a)@xmath109(d ) ] and for @xmath34 [ ( e)@xmath109(f ) ] ( logarithmic color scale ) .",
    "the respective data set at the maximum applied field of @xmath110 has been subtracted . in ( a)@xmath109(d ) , @xmath31 is normal to the detector plane , whereas in ( e)@xmath109(f ) @xmath31 is horizontal in the plane . ]",
    "subtracting the total @xmath45 at @xmath110 from the total @xmath45 at lower fields , we obtain the spin - misalignment sans cross section @xmath68 [ eq .",
    "( [ sigmasmpara ] ) ] , which is free of nuclear sans . the results for @xmath68 for the textured nanocomposite [ fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) ] still reveal an angular anisotropy with maxima parallel and antiparallel to the horizontal texture axis .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "( [ sigmasmpara ] ) then suggests that this observation may be due to ( i ) spin components which are directed along the @xmath111-direction [ cf .",

    "( [ sigmasmpara ] ) ] and/or due to ( ii ) the particle form factor anisotropy ( cf .",
    "terms @xmath113 ) .",
    "however , measurements in the @xmath34 geometry [ compare fig .  [ fig1](a ) ] suggest that longitudinal magnetization fluctuations play only a minor role : if the @xmath68 ( for @xmath34 ) were dominated by @xmath114 , a @xmath115-type anisotropy with intensity maxima along the vertical direction would result [ compare eq .",
    "( [ sigmatotperp ] ) ] .",

    "[ fig7](f ) ] , which exhibit a horizontal elongation [ cf .  the term @xmath116 in eq .  ( [ sigmatotperp ] ) ] . in other words ,",
    "the anisotropy of the scattering pattern for @xmath35 [ fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) ] is due to an anisotropy in the magnetic microstructure , not to the form - factor anisotropy @xmath114 of the particles .",
    "we emphasize that , although the mean magnetization in the remanent state is directed along the @xmath14-axis [ @xmath43-direction in fig .  [ fig1](a ) and @xmath44-direction in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , the magnetic neutron scattering cross section is in both geometries dominated by the respective @xmath116 term , which ( in real space ) is related to small misaligned spin components varying along the @xmath111-direction @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy in the spin microstructure may be related to the finding of a crystallographic texture : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , diffraction peaks of the type @xmath91 exhibit two maxima along the vertical direction ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
    "the investigation of the relation between this crystallographic texture and the spin texture is of interest in its own right and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that recent electron - microscopy and three - dimensional atom - probe tomography work by liu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also reports anisotropic properties of the grain - boundary phase in hot - deformed nanocrystalline nd - fe - b magnets ; namely , these authors found that the concentration of rare - earth elements is higher for intergranular phases parallel to the flat surface of the platelet - shaped @xmath3 grains as compared to intergranular phases along the short side of the platelets .",
    "the characteristic size of the spin inhomogeneities in the remanent state along the vertical and horizontal direction has been estimated by computing [ using eq .",

    "field - dependent sans measurements are helpful , since they allow one to determine the field evolution of @xmath123 , from which the size of the defect ( causing the spin perturbation ) and the exchange correlation length may be obtained @xcite .",
