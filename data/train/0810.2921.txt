    "the inclusive decay @xmath0 is of much interest because of its potential to constrain the ckm element @xmath3 . due to experimental cuts required to suppress charm background , measurements of this decay are available only in the shape - function region , where the hadronic final state is collimated into a single jet carrying a large energy on the order of @xmath4 and a moderate invariant mass squared on the order of @xmath5 .",
    "the theory challenge is to calculate partial decay rates in the presence of these cuts , where a local operator product expansion is insufficient .",
    "a systematic treatment relies on a non - local operator product expansion whose end result can be formulated in terms of a factorization theorem .",
    "different approaches to this factorization have been put forth in the literature , going under the names of blnp @xcite , ggou @xcite , and the dressed - gluon exponentiation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to describe the elements that go into the blnp formalism at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in @xmath1 and leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "the main point of discussion is the factorization formula for an arbitrary decay distribution restricted to the kinematics of the shape - function region @xmath6 where the symbol @xmath7 denotes a convolution .",
    "the factorization formula contains a hard function @xmath8 , which is related to physics at the hard scale @xmath4 , a jet function @xmath9 , which is related to physics at the intermediate scale @xmath5 , and a non - perturbative shape function @xmath10 , describing the internal soft dynamics of the @xmath11 meson @xcite .",
    "this factorized form was originally derived in @xcite using diagrammatic techniques , and was rederived in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) in @xcite .",
    "the hard and jet functions to nlo in perturbation theory have been known for some time @xcite , and the nnlo jet function was obtained in @xcite .",
    "very recently , the nnlo contributions to the hard function have also been calculated @xcite , thus completing the perturbative corrections to the factorization formula to this order . in section [ sec : nnlofact ] we review the calculation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 to nnlo , along with the form and solutions of their renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution equations .",
    "then , in section [ sec : numerics ] , we give preliminary results illustrating the numerical impact of the nnlo corrections on the @xmath12 spectrum , comment on the relevance for the determination of @xmath3 , and make some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we describe the calculation of the hard and jet functions at nnlo , as well as the form and solution of their rg evolution equations .",
    "the hard function arises when integrating out fluctuations at the scale @xmath4 by matching qcd onto scet .",
    "this matching can be done at the level of the @xmath13 transition current , and to leading order in @xmath2 takes the form @xmath14 where we have followed the scet conventions of @xcite , and the @xmath15 are a set of three dirac structures . in practice ,",
    "the matching calculation is carried out in momentum space and yields results for the fourier - transformed coefficients , which read @xmath16 the hard function @xmath8 is derived from the matrix of coefficients @xmath17 .    to obtain",
    "the matching coefficients @xmath18 requires to calculate uv - renormalized matrix elements in full qcd and scet .",
    "the calculation is simplest when the external states are chosen as on - shell quarks and both uv and ir divergences are regulated in dimensional regularization in @xmath19 dimensions . in that case",
    "the loop corrections to the scet matrix elements are given by scaleless integrals and vanish , so that the result is just its tree - level value multiplied by renormalization factors from operator and wave - function renormalization .",
    "the main challenge is to calculate the qcd result , which is written in terms of three dirac structures multiplied by scalar form factors @xmath20 . to obtain these scalar form factors at nnlo requires to calculate the two - loop corrections to the @xmath13 current in qcd .",
    "this task has been completed in @xcite .",
    "one then turns the results for the scalar form factors @xmath21 into those for the scet wilson coefficients by evaluating the matching conditions @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a current renormalization factor .",
    "details of the matching calculation and results for the wilson coefficients have been presented in @xcite .    in the blnp approach , the hard function",
    "is evaluated at a scale @xmath24  gev and logarithms of the ratio @xmath25 are treated as large .",
    "one can resum these logarithms by deriving and solving the rg equation for the hard coefficients @xmath18 , or equivalently the matrix of coefficients @xmath26 .",
    "the evolution equation has the form ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath27h_{ij}(\\bar n \\cdot p,\\mu ) \\,,\\ ] ] and its solution is @xmath28 h_{ij}(\\bar n \\cdot p,\\mu_h)\\,,\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath29 .",
    "explicit results for the sudakov factor @xmath10 and the anomalous exponents @xmath30 , @xmath31 can be read off from @xcite .",
    "a consistent treatment at nnlo in @xmath1 requires the matching coefficients at two loops , the anomalous dimension @xmath32 at three loops , and the cusp anomalous dimension at four loops .",
    "the anomalous dimensions are both known to one loop lower , which adds a small uncertainty to the analysis .",
    "we now turn to the jet function @xmath9 , which arises when integrating out fluctuations at the intermediate scale @xmath5 by matching scet onto hqet .",
    "the calculation of the jet function can be recast into the evaluation of the imaginary part of a certain vacuum matrix element in qcd , and was calculated to nnlo in @xcite . in light - cone gauge , this matrix element is the quark propagator .",
    "the jet function depends on a renormalization scale @xmath33 , which is usually kept fixed at @xmath34  gev in the blnp approach . however , it is possible to derive and solve the rg equation for @xmath9 , which allows one to also vary the renormalization scale at which the jet function is evaluated .",
    "the starting point is the exact integro - differential evolution equation derived in @xcite : @xmath35 j(p^2,\\mu )     - 2\\gamma_{\\rm cusp } \\int_0^{p^2}\\!dp^{\\prime 2}\\ ,     \\frac{j(p^{\\prime 2},\\mu)-j(p^2,\\mu)}{p^2-p^{\\prime 2 } } \\,.\\ ] ] a novel solution to the evolution equation ( [ jrge ] ) was presented in @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the observation that the laplace transformed jet function @xmath36 obeys a local evolution equation analogous to ( [ eq : rgh ] ) . solving as before and inverting the laplace transform gives the resummed @xmath9 in momentum space . alternatively ,",
    "it is always possible to write partial decay rates in terms of an integral over the jet function , defined as @xmath37 using the solution of the rg equation , one can write a compact expression for the resummed integrated jet function @xmath38 \\left(\\frac{q^2}{\\mu_i^2}\\right)^\\eta \\widetilde j\\big(\\partial_\\eta+\\ln\\frac{q^2}{\\mu_i^2},\\mu_i\\big ) \\frac{e^{-\\gamma_e\\eta}}{\\gamma(1+\\eta ) } , \\ ] ] where expressions for the rg factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be found in @xcite . equations ( [ eq : resummedh ] ) and ( [ eq : resummedj ] ) allow one to evaluate integrals of the product @xmath41 at an arbitrary scale @xmath42 at which the shape function is renormalized , and study the dependence of partial decay rates under independent variations of the matching scales @xmath43 and @xmath44 , under which they are formally independent .",
    "detailed numerical results shall be given in @xcite .",
    "[ ] @xmath43 ( gev ) [ ] @xmath45 [ ] [ ] lo [ ] nlo [ ] nnlo    in this section we briefly explore the numerical impact of the nnlo corrections , taking as an example the partial rate with a cut @xmath46 .",
    "this partial rate can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and the hard and integrated jet functions are to be evaluated in their resummed forms ( [ eq : resummedh ] ) and ( [ eq : resummedj ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath49 is related to certain combinations of the @xmath26 and can be deduced from @xcite . to evaluate ( [ eq : p+ ] )",
    "requires a model for the shape function . in what follows ,",
    "we use the two - parameter exponential model @xmath50 it is possible to put model - independent constraints on the normalization factor @xmath51 and the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 by studying shape - function moments @xcite .",
    "these moments are defined as @xmath54 and can be obtained as an expansion in local hqet operators as long as @xmath55 .",
    "the zeroth moment fixes the normalization of the shape function and was determined to nnlo in @xcite , and can be used along with the first and second moment to define the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the shape - function scheme .",
    "numerical values for the hqet parameters @xmath4 and @xmath57 in the shape - function scheme at nnlo can be determined from those obtained from global fits in other schemes using the two - loop conversion relations derived in @xcite .",
    "one then tunes the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that the moments of the model function ( [ eq : smod ] ) give appropriate results for @xmath4 and @xmath57 . in our analysis here",
    ", we tune the parameters such that @xmath58  gev and @xmath59 at nnlo in the shape - function scheme .    in figure",
    "[ fig : scalevar ] , we show results for the partial rate with a cut @xmath46 , for the choice @xmath60  gev , as a function of the hard matching scale @xmath43 . from the figure",
    ", one sees that the dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath43 is reduced when going to higher orders in perturbation theory , and also that there is a fairly large downward shift in the central value between nlo and nnlo .",
    "this would tend to raise the value of @xmath3 compared to the result deduced from the nlo calculation in the blnp approach .",
    "however , we must stress that these numerical results are preliminary , and will be finalized in @xcite , along with uncertainties associated with variations of the matching scale @xmath61 results for other partial rates , such as those with cuts on the hadronic invariant mass and lepton energy , will also be presented .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the partial decay rates are rather sensitive to the numerical value of @xmath4 .",
    "if , as suggested in @xcite , the @xmath62 moments are excluded from global fits on the grounds that measurements of the photon energy spectrum are made in kinematic regions where shape - function effects are important , then @xmath4 tends to come out closer to @xmath63  gev .",
    "changing @xmath4 by such an amount raises the partial decay rates upwards by approximately 20% .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath3 from inclusive decays will thus require that this point be settled .",
