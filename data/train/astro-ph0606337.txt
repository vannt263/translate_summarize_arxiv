    "extragalactic globular cluster ( gc ) systems provide an observational probe of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "gcs may have formed even before galaxies were fully assembled , as well as during subsequent star formation episodes ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "since the milky way serves as a standard against which other gc systems are compared , it is particularly important to study gc systems in other spiral galaxies to establish whether the milky way gc system is typical .",
    "the study of spiral gc systems is complicated by their generally smaller gc populations and uncertainties in the internal extinction conditions .",
    "nonetheless , data from the hubble space telescope s ( hst ) wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) have helped establish the properties of gc systems in several spiral galaxies , including detailed studies of individual galaxies @xcite as well as limited - scale surveys @xcite .",
    "while these efforts illustrated the important role of space - based telescopes in extragalactic gc studies , large gc samples have been difficult to obtain for all but the most densely populated systems due to the small field of view of the wfpc2 .",
    "in contrast , the hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) has higher sensitivity and doubles the areal coverage .",
    "it is thus a powerful tool for global studies of gc systems , as demonstrated by a number of acs surveys of such systems in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figsomb ] shows ngc 4594 , the `` sombrero galaxy '' , which is a nearby ( @xmath8  mpc or m@xmath2m@xmath9 , see @xmath10 for derivation ) , nearly edge - on ( i=84 ) , spiral galaxy ( type sa ) with a populous gc system . the sombrero is the most massive member of a small galaxy group . while its classification as a spiral galaxy is questionable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* call it an s0 ) , the sombrero does appear to be an intermediate case between elliptical and late - type spiral galaxies , therefore a unique system to analyze .",
    "the gc systems of both spiral and elliptical galaxies generally possess at least two gc subpopulations characterized as metal - poor ( blue ) and metal - rich ( red ) gcs @xcite . due to the notorious metallicity - age degeneracy @xcite ,",
    "ages and metallicities can not be independently constrained by broad - band colors alone .",
    "ages derived from keck spectra of 14 sombrero gcs , suggest that both subpopulations are @xmath11 gyr old @xcite , as is the case in the milky way gc system .",
    "@xcite used vlt spectra to derive mean metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath12 and [ fe / h]@xmath13 for the sombrero s two gc subpopulations .",
    "a ground - based , wide - field imaging study ( r@xmath14 20 ) of the sombrero by @xcite showed that the red gcs are distributed spherically and suggested their association with the galaxy s bulge rather than its disk .",
    "@xcite used a @xmath15 wide - field , ground - based image to show that the gc surface density drops to zero at a projected radius of @xmath16 ( @xmath17  kpc ) .",
    "they estimated a total gc population of 1900 and calculated a specific frequency , s@xmath18 , where s@xmath19n @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that sombrero s red gcs are , on average , @xmath630% smaller in size than its blue gcs .",
    "the hubble heritage project sponsored a six - pointing , acs mosaic of the sombrero galaxy ( pi : keith noll , hst pid 9714 ) .",
    "each pointing consisted of @xmath21675s exposures with the f435w ( b ) filter , @xmath21500s with the f555w ( v ) and @xmath21350s with the f625w ( r ) . figure  [ figsomb ] illustrates the @xmath22 region covered by the image mosaic .",
    "each pointing was analysed separately .",
    "raw acs images were prepared for analysis with the standard stsci `` on - the - fly '' data reprocessing system .",
    "this data pipeline made use of the latest calibration files ( e.g. dark current reference file ) to prepare raw data and corrected the significant geometric distortion in the acs by `` drizzling '' together multiple exposures .",
    "the calibrated , drizzled data products were downloaded and prepared for object detection by removing diffuse galaxy light via the subtraction of a median filtered image . to detect gc candidates on the background - subtracted images ,",
    "the find task in the daophotii aperture photometry software application @xcite was used . an intentionally low detection threshold ( @xmath23 )",
    "was used to maximize the chances of finding a faint object .",
    "spurious detections were effectively removed by matching up detected objects across the three bands .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out on the original images using the phot / daophotii routine with a 5 pixel radius and individual sky values calculated from a 10 pixel wide annulus that began 30 pixels from the object center .",
    "a larger aperture size was not used because it would have contributed more noise from the sky than signal from the object . to compensate for the light found just outside the 5-pixel aperture , the median aperture difference ( 5@xmath210 pixels ) from candidate gcs",
    "was subtracted from all objects .",
    "additional aperture corrections were applied according to the published 10 pixel ( @xmath24 ) to nominal infinite values from the acs photometric performance and calibration @xcite .",
    "although ignored in the present study , a systematic error is expected on the 10 pixel to infinity corrections because , unlike the synthetic stars used to calculate these corrections , extended sources will show light beyond the 10 pixel aperture radius . from a few extremely isolated gcs in a b - band image , this effect is estimated to be slight ( @xmath25 mag ) .",
    "galactic foreground extinction corrections were applied using the reddening values , e ( ) , which corresponded to the center of each of the six pointings in the dirbe dust maps of @xcite . to convert the e ( ) values to the corresponding extinction values ( a@xmath26 )",
    "the reddening conversion factors from table  14 of @xcite were used assuming a g2 spectral energy distribution .",
    "table  [ tbl - corr ] summarizes the corrections applied for each filter .",
    "corrected photometry was then transformed from the acs system to the johnson bv and cousins r systems using the coefficients and technique described in @xcite .",
    "globular cluster sizes were calculated using the ishape algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm estimates the half - light radius ( r@xmath27 ) by convolving a point spread function ( psf ) with an analytic profile , varying the fwhm until the best match to the object profile is found . at the distance of the sombrero , typical gcs ( r@xmath28pc ) will show angular radii of @xmath29 , which is slightly larger than the pixel scale of @xmath30 pixel@xmath31 . after testing three different psf derivation methods ( described in the following paragraph ) an empirical psf",
    "was adopted for estimating object sizes . the final analysis made use of mean sizes derived from the three available bands .",
    "see @xmath32 for details of combining the size information from the three bands , size selection criteria , and the estimated size accuracy .    ]",
    "model psfs for the hst cameras are generated with the tiny tim program , which also supplies a charge diffusion kernel ( dk ) that must be convolved with the psf after it is re - binned for comparison with an object profile .",
    "since the psf varies across the two acs ccds , a @xmath33 grid of tiny tim psfs was generated for each ccd .",
    "ishape was directed to convolve these psfs with a @xcite model ( concentration parameter fixed at @xmath34 ) and estimate the fwhm of the object profiles on the f435w images .",
    "this method yielded no objects with the zero half - light radius that would be expected for foreground stars , suggesting the object profiles are broadened compared to the tiny tim models , likely from the `` drizzling '' process .",
    "two methods were explored to resolve this problem .",
    "the first used an empirical psf constructed from bright isolated stars on the acs images .",
    "the second method involved the creation of a broader dk to effectively re - distribute the light away from the center of the tiny tim psfs , thereby accounting for the drizzle broadening .",
    "this broader dk was created by uniformly populating a blank pre - drizzle image ( `` flt '' acs data suffix ) with a number of isolated pixels with non - zero values .",
    "after these images were drizzled , the broadened signal from the non - zero pixels was averaged and convolved with the original dk , producing a broader dk .",
    "figure  [ figcmpr2size ] compares the estimated r@xmath27 using the original and modified dk methods with the empirical - psf sizes .",
    "compared to the empirical values , sizes derived from the broader dk are larger by approximately 0.3 pixels . the original method produced half - light radii of objects resembling gcs that are larger by @xmath35 pixels relative to the empirical sizes . both the modified dk and original methods produced non - zero sizes for those objects that appear to be stellar in the empirical sizes .",
    "therefore the empirical psf - derived sizes were adopted since these are the least broadened and stars are readily identifiable .",
    "selection criteria based upon magnitude , color , size , shape , and location were used to construct a catalogue of sombrero gc candidates .",
    "a description of the limits imposed on the photometric properties of all detected objects follows in the next subsection . in @xmath32 ,",
    "the derivation of sizes is described and how they were employed in the selection process .",
    "section  [ contamin ] addresses contamination in the sombrero gc dataset .",
    "objects within the image region containing the dust lanes were excluded from the gc candidate catalogue ( see figure  [ figsomb ] ) to avoid hii regions , young massive clusters , and uncertain extinction conditions .",
    "photometric completeness tests were performed by generating artificial objects ( using addstar / daophotii ) modelled upon an empirical psf generated from isolated gcs .",
    "colors of these artificial objects reflected the mean observed gc colors .",
    "five thousand artificial objects with the same luminosity were randomly distributed across the six pointings for each 0.1 magnitude interval between 18 and 28 mag . the same data reduction procedure as described in @xmath36",
    "( except size analysis ) was carried out on these artificial fields and the resulting detection rates are shown in figure  [ figcomp ] .",
    "the r@xmath37 of the artificial objects were recorded during the tests to obtain a more suitable completeness function when analyzing the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) at different galactocentric distances .",
    "the @xmath38 completeness level from the combined six pointings is v @xmath39 .    a faint magnitude limit of v @xmath40 ( at the @xmath41 completeness level )",
    "was chosen to exclude contamination that begins to contribute very significantly at fainter magnitudes , as shown in figure  [ figrawcmd ] and discussed in section  [ contamin ] .",
    "this magnitude limit allows access to gcs @xmath0 mag below the observed turnover magnitude of v @xmath42 , or approximately @xmath41 of the expected gc population ( see @xmath10 ) .",
    "since the number of objects with magnitudes near this limit is so small , essentially no selection bias is introduced by imposing a selection criteria on a single band to a sample which spans a @xmath43 range in colors ( i.e. the number of candidate gcs increases by a negligible amount if b - band rather than a v - band magnitude limit is used ) .",
    "r@xmath44 ) , and inner ( r@xmath45 ) image regions , respectively.[figcomp ] ]    objects were selected as gcs if their colors fell within the ranges @xmath46 b@xmath2r @xmath47 and @xmath48 b@xmath2v @xmath49 . as shown in figure  [ figrawcmd ] , these color limits correspond to the observed gc colors , with a small `` buffer '' to allow for some photometric scatter among the faintest gcs . to convert broad - band colors to metallicities a straight line was fitted to the [ fe / h ] and color values of milky way gcs with e(b@xmath2v ) @xmath50 @xcite . to supplement the metal - rich end , spectroscopic metallicities derived from sombrero gcs @xcite",
    "were paired with the acs photometric information and included in the linear fits .",
    "figure  [ figcolormet ] shows this data , which yielded the following color - metallicity transformations : [ fe / h ] @xmath51(b@xmath2r ) , [ fe / h ] @xmath52(b@xmath2v ) and [ fe / h ] @xmath53(v@xmath2r ) .",

    "the transformation is represented by the solid line and was derived from a linear fit to milky way ( mw ) gcs with galactic reddening values of e(b@xmath2v ) @xmath60 from the @xcite catalogue ( circles ) and the metallicity values derived from sombrero gc spectroscopy ( triangles ; * ? ? ?",

    "roundness and sharpness thresholds were based upon the inspection of all objects that resembled gc in color and size .",
    "finally , gc candidates were inspected for any obvious contaminants ( e.g. , hii regions , disky galaxies ) and for duplicate objects lying on the six - image mosaic overlap regions .",
    "as described in @xmath63 , object sizes were determined using an empirical psf and the profile - fitting routine ishape . to reduce noise from the fitting process ,",
    "three size values were determined for each object by running ishape on each of the b , v and r band images .",
    "the final size was taken to be the mean of the three size values , which first underwent an iterative sigma - clipping algorithm to remove outliers and systematics as is described in the following paragraph .",
    "regions indicated by dotted lines .",
    "solid line is a 1:1 line for comparison.[figbandsizes ] ]    the v band sizes were arbitrarily chosen to be the reference system . using the objects which passed the aforementioned selection criteria ,",
    "systematic differences between the bands were estimated by fitting a line to the v versus b and v versus r size values .",
    "these fits were used to remove the systematics by forcing the b and r sizes to show a 1:1 trend with the v sizes .",
    "objects falling more than @xmath23 from the two 1:1 lines were discarded from further analysis .",
    "a line was fit to the modified dataset to gain a more accurate understanding of the systematics .",
    "after applying a correction to the b and r sizes with the improved systematic estimate , another @xmath23 clip was applied to each of the final 1:1 lines . for the remaining objects",
    "the mean of the resulting size values was adopted as the final size .",
    "figure  [ figbandsizes ] compares the size values of the three bands , after the above procedure was applied .",
    "the majority of the objects that were removed in the sigma clipping algorithm tend to be fainter objects , as shown in figure [ figsizecmd ] .",
    "a significant difference between the observed object sizes in at least one of the bands likely indicates the object is not a typical old stellar system , an idea that is supported by the fact that a significant portion of these objects deviate from typical gc colors ( figure  [ figsizecmd ] ) .",
    "least - squares rms values of the final size fits are 0.095 and 0.082 pixels for the v versus b and v versus r sizes , respectively .",
    "thus the sizes are accurate at approximately the 0.1  pixels ( or 0.2  pc ) level . to remove stellar contaminants from the dataset , a lower - limit of 0.3  pixels was enforced to account for any sizes that deviated by @xmath23 from a size of zero , as shown in figure  [ figrawsize ] .",
    "objects with ishape ellipticities ( @xmath64 ) greater than 0.5 were also discarded as likely background galaxies .",
    "the completeness tests presented at the beginning of this section did not account for the size selections , therefore these completeness functions are not perfect representations of the complete sombrero gc selection process .",
    "the true completeness functions likely differ by a small amount , since the objects removed in the sigma clipping algorithm tend to be unlike gcs ( figure  [ figsizecmd ] ) and the number of stars predicted and found in the mosaic make up only a small fraction of the data sample ( see the following subsection ) .",

    "lacking such a control field , b and v images ( 2400  seconds  in b and 1120s  in v ) from the hubble deep field north of the goods survey ( hst i d 9583 ; * ? ? ?",

    "a single region of the survey was reduced in exactly the same manner as the sombrero mosaic and sizes were determined on the b image bands .",
    "the images were examined and found to have few sombrero gc - like objects when the selection criteria were applied , as shown in figure  [ figcmdcont ] .",
    "even when one increases the observed objects found in the control field by a factor of six to account for the six pointings in the acs mosaic , the number of background objects classified as sombrero gcs would be only 24 objects , or @xmath66 of the final sombrero gc sample .",
    "this investigation also supports the faint sombrero magnitude limit , which was motivated by an obvious increase in the background contamination at v @xmath67 ( see figure  [ figrawcmd ] ) , corresponding to the objects detected in the control field .    since this control field",
    "was originally selected to avoid stars , it is necessary to estimate the contamination from foreground stars . from the @xcite galaxy model ,",
    "approximately 40 stars with the same apparent magnitude and b@xmath2v colors as the sombrero gcs are estimated to be within the acs mosaic region .",
    "after applying all photometric selection criteria to the objects detected in the sombrero field , approximately 41 objects are classified as foreground stars because they fall below the lower size limit of r@xmath65 pixels ( i.e. there are 41 objects within the color limits and below the vertical line in figure  [ figrawsize ] ) .",
    "this number is consistent with the predicted number of stars , thus the sombrero gc sample likely contains a negligible amount of contamination from foreground stars .",
    "figure  [ figgoodcmd ] shows the b@xmath2r , b@xmath2v and v@xmath2r color - magnitude diagrams of the 659 objects that met the gc selection criteria . to parametrize the gc color distribution a bayesian univariate normal mixture analytical method @xcite was used via a software routine named `` nmix '' .",
    "peak colors of b@xmath2r = 1.15 and 1.44 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) were found with 53% of the gcs assigned to the blue subpopulation . as shown in table  [ tabcolor ] , the gc subpopulation peak metallicities and blue proportions are similar to the same values from the b@xmath2v and v@xmath2r color distributions .",
    "a kmm test @xcite performed on the b@xmath2r colors supports a bimodal distribution over a unimodal one at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "@xcite detected a sombrero bimodal metallicity distribution with 59% blue gcs and subpopulation peak b@xmath2r values consistent with these results .",
    "since their ground - based study extended to the `` edge '' of the gc system at r@xmath70 ( while the acs mosaic has r@xmath71 ) , and because blue clusters tend to dominate the halo , their larger percentage of blue gcs is not unexpected . in the subsequent analysis ,",
    "blue gcs are taken to be those with b@xmath2r colors @xmath72 , and red gcs are those with b@xmath2r @xmath73 1.30 .",
    "the only exception to this rule are the two brightest gcs with b@xmath2r @xmath73 1.30 .",
    "it is assumed these are in fact `` metal - poor gcs '' that happen to lie at the extreme of a metallicity - mass trend ( presented in section  [ sectiontilt ] ) and therefore show redder colors compared to typical metal - poor gcs .    using a conversion from b@xmath2r to v@xmath2i from milky way gcs @xcite",

    "the acs red peak is likely different from the past studies because the red part of the color transformation is poorly constrained due to the small numbers of red milky way gcs .    to quantify the intrinsic dispersions of the subpopulations , the sample was limited to v @xmath74 and nmix",
    "was used to estimate the gaussian dispersions : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "other studies have similarly exploited the low photometric uncertainty of the acs data and estimated the intrinsic subpopulation dispersions @xcite .",
    "as found here , each of these studies detected a larger color spread in the metal - rich subpopulation compared to the metal - poor gcs .",
    "however , lacking a standardized color - to - metallicity transformation needed for a physical interpretation , it is difficult to make conclusive statements about the intrinsic dispersions of the gc subpopulations .",
    "for instance , the present analysis agrees with @xcite in that a _ smaller _ metallicity dispersion is inferred in the metal - poor subpopulation , but a non - linear color - to - metallicity transformation in @xcite yielded a _ larger _ metallicity dispersion among the metal - poor gcs compared to the metal - rich gcs .",

    "this idea is motivated by an analogous size - mass upturn found in the young counterparts to gcs , young massive clusters @xcite .",
    "supporting this is a striking absence in figure  [ figmagsiz2 ] of sombrero gcs with m@xmath210 that are smaller than the median size of the sample ( r@xmath211  pc ) .",
    "this is unexpected given the intrinsic scatter in sizes is quite large ( sombrero size standard deviation is @xmath212  pc ) and if the upturn was caused entirely by the presence of accreted de nuclei , high - luminosity indigenous gcs with small sizes should still be observed .",
    "thus an absence of small bright objects is consistent with an intrinsic origin for the size - magnitude upturn .    similarly determining if a deficiency of bright gcs with small sizes exists in other systems ( and therefore a size - magnitude upturn ) is a simple exercise to test whether the size - magnitude upturn is a common feature .",

    "the figure that partially motivated this idea is the same which here is suggested to demonstrate a deficiency of luminous objects with small sizes . thus the size - magnitude upturn shown in figure  6 of @xcite may actually begin at m@xmath214 where the deficiency noted here becomes apparent . a fainter absolute magnitude marking the emergence of the sombrero upturn , m@xmath215 , may indicate the upturn appears in even less massive compact stellar systems than demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "if the sombrero upturn is indeed an intrinsic feature of its massive gcs , it supports a continuous trend of magnitude - dependent sizes from the brightest gcs to more massive stellar systems such as de nuclei and ucds .",
    "validating the shallower metal - rich size - magnitude trend is difficult because completeness effects ( where faint , extended gcs are missed ) conceivably could have caused the trend . a quantitative investigation into these effects and a careful consideration of the numerous size - related trends ( as demonstrated in * ?",

    "it is also noted that a combination of the extended radial distribution of the metal - poor subpopulation and an underlying size - r@xmath37 trend ( i.e. , projection effects , see @xmath216 ) plausibly could introduce enough scatter to hide an analogous size - magnitude trend in the metal - poor subpopulation .",

    "the number of red gcs normalized to the bulge luminosity , the bulge specific frequency , is found to be larger than all spiral galaxies for which this value has been calculated .",
    "this suggests the rate of metal - rich gc formation was enhanced and/or gc destruction was less effective in the sombrero galaxy relative to less massive spirals .",
    "a color - magnitude trend , a so - called `` blue tilt '' , was discovered in the metal - poor gc subpopulation that is likely a metallicity - mass trend ( figure  [ figgoodcmd ] ) .",
    "the metal - rich subpopulation shows no strong evidence for an analogous trend .",
    "the sombrero provides the first example of this trend in a spiral galaxy and a galaxy found in a low - density galaxy environment .",
    "the blue tilt extends from the brightest gcs to at least the gclf tom , in agreement with the findings of @xcite . a shallower trend , in terms of metallicity - mass proportionality ,",
    "is found here compared to examples in massive ellipticals found in high - density galaxy environments @xcite .",
    "this difference and the absence of a blue tilt in ngc  4472 likely indicates the gradient of the color - magnitude trend depends on the specific properties of the host galaxy .",
    "it is shown that gc sizes correlate with r@xmath37 ( figure  [ figsizerad ] ) . from the extended radial coverage provided by the sombrero acs mosaic ,",
    "the metal - rich gcs are found to have a steeper size - r@xmath37 gradient compared to the metal - poor subpopulation , thus causing the mean subpopulation sizes to become identical at larger r@xmath37 ( figure  [ figcolsizerad ] ) .",
    "these observations are consistent with projection effects being largely responsible for the observed gc subpopulation size difference @xcite , as opposed to an intrinsic feature of their respective metallicities @xcite .",
    "a size - magnitude upturn was discovered among the brightest gcs ( m@xmath228 ) , where the sizes increase as a function of increasing luminosity ( figure  [ figmagsiz ] ) .",
    "the accretion of dwarf elliptical nuclei into the sombrero gc system provides a plausible scenario for this trend . however , an analogous trend among young massive clusters @xcite and a noticeable deficiency of luminous gcs ( m@xmath229 ) with smaller than average sizes ( figure  [ figmagsiz2 ] ; also see figure  6  in mieske et al .",
    "2006 ) , supports an intrinsic origin for the size - magnitude upturn .",
    "an intrinsic size - magnitude upturn suggests the most massive gcs are at the low - mass end of a continuous trend that includes more massive systems such as dwarf nuclei and ucds .",
    "a shallower positive size - magnitude trend among metal - rich gcs is found at all magnitudes .",
    "the luminosity - size proportionality , r@xmath218 , is consistent with the same fits to young star clusters of the merger galaxy ngc 3256 @xcite and 18 nearby spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the consistency is a reflection of a real trend or the result of a completeness effect .",
