    "after the cabibbo - favoured @xmath2 mode was first reported , in 1993 , by cleo ii [ 1 ] and updated in 1995 [ 2 ] , the exclusive radiative decays , @xmath0 and @xmath3 , as well as the inclusive ones , @xmath4 , have become main targets for both experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "the exclusive modes , which are easier to be experimentally investigated [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] , but less theoretically clear , have been worked out in different approaches .",
    "for example , the spin symmetry for heavy quarks combined with wave function models [ 6 , 7 ] or the heavy quark effective theory when both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are heavy [ 8 ] have been used .",

    "recently , detailed analyses of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , with the inclusion of hard spectator and vertex corrections , have been performed [ 9 - 11 ] and a consistent treatment , based on a new factorization formula , has been proposed [ 12 ] . besides an independent determination of the @xmath9 ratio ,",
    "the @xmath2 decays are suitable for studying the viability of susy extensions of the sm , in view of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp tests , and for imposing constraints on the supersymmetric benchmark scenarios [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyse the @xmath0 decay , in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) context .",

    ", we employ the pqcd approach developed by szczepaniak _",
    "et al . _ for decays dominated by tree diagrams [ 15 ] and later extended to _ penguin _ processes [ 16 ] .",
    "in order to fit the @xmath10 estimation with data and since large cp asymmetries , which are expected to be measured more precisely in the near future , at the hadron machines , seam to have a new physics origin , we extend our analysis beyond the sm . in this respect , we make use of the mass insertion method and include , in the wilson coefficients @xmath11 , gluino - mediated fcnc contributions .",
