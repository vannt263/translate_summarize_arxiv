    "( 2008a ) show that the observed absorption depth ( ad ) is well approximated by :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is ad at @xmath5 and h the scale height .",
    "thus the observed mean ad over a wavelength range of a given spectral element , is proportional to the temperature and to the logarithm of the cross section .",
    "we use the absorption depth ( ad ) curve as a function of the wavelength from 4000   to 8000   obtained by sing et al.2008a .",
    "the spectrum at wavelength below 8000   is considered here where the absorption due to water molecules is negligible ( barman et al .",
    "this ad spectrum is composed of three remarkable features ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) :    1 .",
    "_ rayleigh scattering_. the feature in nuv , at wavelength @xmath6 @xmath7 5000  , was first reported by ballester et al .",
    "2007 and explained by the absorption of a hot hydrogen layer within the atmosphere .",
    "here we propose an alternative explanation invoking the rayleigh scattering by h@xmath1 molecules ( lecavelier et al .",
    "na depletion and atmospheric structure_. within the same datasets , we find that the na spectral line profile is characterized by a wide absorption with a sharp transition to a narrow absorption profile at higher altitudes values ( sing et al.2008b ) .",
    "this sharp transition is interpreted by condensation or ionization which deplete na atoms in the upper atmosphere . using a global fit to these data , from 3000   to 6200  , we determine the average pressure - temperature profile ( @xmath8 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig_tp ] , at the planetary terminator ( sing et al.2008b ) .",
    "tio / vo_. a third broad band absorption feature in the range 6200   @xmath9 8000   appears on the absorption depth spectrum and is still unexplained .",
    "although no typical tio and vo spectral signatures have been identified unambiguously in the observed spectrum , we suggest that the opacities of those molecules are the best candidates to explain the remaining continuous broad band absorption observed in this wavelength domain ( dsert et al .",
    "submitted ) . using the _ p - t _ profile  from sing et al .  2008b , we derived upper limits for the tio and vo abundances .",
    "we found that the abundance of tio should be around @xmath10 to @xmath11 solar , and the abundance vo around @xmath11 to @xmath12 solar ( dsert et al .",
    "submitted ) .",
    "the temperature inversion leads to high temperature at both low and high pressure .",
    "this temperature bifurcation was very well predicted by atmospheric models of strongly irradiated planets ( hubeny et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the lower part of the atmosphere ( @xmath1330 mbar )",
    ", the temperature is found to be in the range @xmath14 k ( lecavelier et  al .",
    "2008b ) , which corresponds to the m / l / t brown dwarf regime , as expected for a hot jupiter such as hd  209458b ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "however , depending on the effective temperature , a large number of diatomic and polyatomic molecules are predicted to be present according to various models of brown dwarf and hot jupiter ( burrows et al .  1999 ,",
    "lodders et al .  1999 ,",
    "allard et al .",
    "2001 , lodders et al .",
    "2002 , hubeny et al .",
    "2003 ) . among those molecules and at a temperature above 1800 k , titanium oxyde ( tio ) and vanadium oxyde ( vo ) in gas phase equilibrium are most probably present with a high abundance in strongly irradiated planet atmospheres ( seager et al .",
    "1998 , hubeny et al .",
    "2003 , fortney et al .",
    "furthermore , the low albedo measurements of hd  209458b ( rowe et al .  2006 ) rule out most of the absorbants , but tio and vo .",
    "recently , it has been found that a theoretical fit to the hd  209458b near infrared observation at secondary eclipse requires that the dayside atmosphere of hd 209458b have a thermal inversion and a stratosphere ( knutson et al .",
    "2008 , burrows et al .",
    "2007c , burrows et al .",
    "hubeny et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and fortney et al .",
    "( 2007 ) highlight the importance of gaseous tio and vo opacity in their model of highly irradiated close - in giant planets .",
    "the last authors define two classes of irradiated atmospheres .",
    "those which are warm enough to have a strong opacity due to tio and vo gases ( `` pm class '' planets ) , and those that are cooler ( `` pl class '' planets ) dominated by nai and ki . our possible detection of tio / vo and nai in the hot atmosphere of hd  209458b confirm that this planet is located in the transition region between the two classes defined by these authors .",
    "further observation are necessary to better characterize the two different type planets using tio / vo .",
    "more planets can be likely studied using transit observations which allowed discoveries , detection , and characterization of extrasolar objects such as planets and comets ( lecavelier des etangs et al .",
