    "since the discovery of high-@xmath6 copper - oxide superconductors , extensive studies on strongly electron correlated system have been in progress on the basis of physical properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "moreover , from the viewpoint of low - dimensional physics , particular attention is paid to the physical role of one - dimensional ( 1d ) cuo chains included in some families of high-@xmath6 copper oxides such as y - based superconductors with the transition temperature @xmath6=@xmath9 92k .",
    "it is well known that the pr - substitution for y - sites in yba@xmath0cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ( y123 ) and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath12 ( y124 ) compounds dramatically suppresses @xmath6 and superconductivity in cuo@xmath0 planes disappears beyond the critical value of pr , @xmath13=0.5 and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "@xcite such a suppression effect due to pr - substitution on superconductivity has been explained in terms of the hybridization model with respect to pr-4@xmath14 and o-2@xmath15 orbitals.@xcite y124 compound with double chains is thermally stable up to 800 @xmath16c , while in y123/7-@xmath17 oxygen deficiencies are easily introduced at lower annealing temperatures .@xcite intermediate between prba@xmath0cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ( pr123 ) with single chains and prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath12 ( pr124 ) with double chains is the pr@xmath0ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath18 ( pr247 ) compound with an alternative repetition of the cuo single chain and double chain blocks along the @xmath19-axis , isostructural with superconducting y@xmath0ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath18 ( y247 ) .",
    "@xcite in contrast to y123 , y247 retains its orthorhombic structure and its superconducting properties , even after oxygen along the single chains is completely depleted.@xcite this finding is considered to be due to the presence of the double cuo chain block in y247 . for pr247 , it is possible to examine physical properties of metallic double chains in terms of varying oxygen contents along single chains .",
    "recently , matsukawa et al . , discovered that oxygen removed polycrystalline pr@xmath0ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with cuo metallic double chain shows superconductivity around @xmath20 k. @xcite matsushita et al .",

    "however , the reduction treatment on its as - sintered one in vacuum results in diamagnetic character from @xmath37 k for 48 h up to @xmath38 k for 72 h , which reaches highest value over the previous works . @xcite the magnetic susceptibility data taken under 1 oe using the fluxgate device are presented for the 72 h reduction sample . from the zfc magnetization at 2 k , the superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be @xmath39 , indicating bulk superconductivity .",
    "next , let us examine the effect of external pressure on the low - t magnetization in the oxygen removed pr247 .",
    "first of all , application of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting sample enhances @xmath4 k at 0 gpa up to 36 k at 1.2 gpa as shown in fig .",
    "[ mtp ] , where the data included the magnetization of the pressure cell are normalized by the value of magnetization at 40 k. in the inset of fig .",
    "[ mtp](a ) , the enlarged plots are displayed to emphasize the variation of @xmath8 with pressure . in fig.[mtp ] ( b ) , the effect of pressure on @xmath8 of pure pr247 with @xmath35 prepared by a high pressure oxygen technique cited from ref.@xcite shows a rapid rise of @xmath8 from 15 k at ambient pressure up to 24 k at 1 gpa , indicating the stronger dependence of @xmath8 on pressure in comparison to the present result .",
    "recently , ishikawa has reported that the application of pressure on the onset of @xmath6 in pr@xmath0ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath17=0.62 ) increases from 20.6 k at 0 gpa up to 33.1k at 2.5 gpa .",
    "furthermore , increasing pressure above 3 gpa , the superconductivity disappeared and under high pressure above 5 gpa the temperature variation of the resistivity showed a semiconducting like behavior.@xcite these findings suggest that if the pure pr247 sample is located in the underdoped region , the present pr247 sample is near the optimum one .",
    "second , the magnitude of negative magnetization ( the volume of the superconducting state ) is suppressed with the applied pressure of 1.2 gpa , which is contrast to the pressure effect of @xmath8 .",
    "sano et al discussed the suppression of the superconductivity in the cuo double chain under pressure on the basis of tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory.@xcite if the volume shrinkage due to the application of pressure gives rise to a decrease of the distance between the two chains of a cuo double chain , we then expect that an increase of the hopping term between the nearest neighbor oxygen sites occupying 2@xmath15 orbitals , resulting in a suppression of the superconducting corerelation",
    ". their calculation does not take into account for the pressure dependence of carrier concentration , giving no explanation for the overall change of the superconducting state with pressure .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath8 shows a monotonous increase from 15 k at @xmath40 up to 30 k at @xmath41 , which is qualitatively in good agreement with a theoretical prediction by nakano.@xcite comparing the effect of pressure on @xmath8 with the @xmath42 dependence of it , we expect that the application of pressure gives rise to an increase in the superconducting carrier concentration . for several reduction conditions , the temperature variation of electrical resistivity of the present sample pr247",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ rt ] ( a ) . for 72h reduced case , @xmath43(t )",
    "curve exhibits its dramatic drop near 30 k followed by zero resistance at low temperatures .",
    "we notice that the resistivity in the normal state for except lower temperature region rises gradually with increasing the reduction time .",
    "this tendency seems to be not anomalous but common behavior in the present system because an increase of the resistivity in cuo@xmath0 plane , @xmath44 , due to the reduction treatment is predominant over a decrease of that along cuo double chain , @xmath45 at higher temperatures .    finally , we check thermal transport properties of the superconducting and non - superconducting pr247 ( fig . [",
    "rt](b)).(thermal conductivity data are not shown here ) seebeck coefficient @xmath46 is a sensitive probe to examine the electronic state of highly inhomogeneous materials since the thermal current is hard to be disturbed by the grain boundaries in contrast to the electric current . upon decreasing @xmath47 ,",
    "seebeck coefficient @xmath32 of the superconducting sample reaches a maximum peak , then shows a rapid decrease below 200 k , and finally followed by a substantial drop below @xmath48 .",
    "it is true that the behavior of @xmath32 of the as - sintered non - superconducting sample is , both in its temperature dependence and magnitude , similar to that of pr124 with metallic double chain.@xcite the magnitude of @xmath46 of pr124 reaches a small value less than 1 @xmath49v / k below 100 k , which is explained on the basis of the one- to two - dimensional ( 1d-2d ) crossover . for conventional metal , seebeck coefficient is expressed in terms of @xmath50ln@xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the density of electronic state.@xcite in our rough estimation , if we assume that the magnitude of s is proportinal to the energy derivative of @xmath52 , the density of state for 2d metal is independent of the energy , giving @xmath53 .",
    "however , the @xmath46 value of the superconducting pr247 shows a finite value of at most a few @xmath49v / k down to @xmath48 .",
    "this finding is probably ascribed to a variation of the electronic state of the cuo double chain associated with carrier doping into the double - chain block due to the reduction treatment . upon decreasing @xmath47 , the hall coefficient @xmath54 of the 24",
    "h reduced sample changes its sign across 100 k and then exhibits a rapid increases with negative sign .",
    "we expect that the disagreement in sign between @xmath54 and @xmath46 in the oxygen removed sample is ascribed to the dramatic variation of the density of states with reduction treatment since @xmath55 near the fermi energy is related to the sign of seebeck coefficient in addition to the sign of charge carrier .",
    "a previous work@xcite on role of oxygen in pr123 compound revealed that the oxygen deficient pr123 phase remains highly insulating state , causing neither metallic or superconducting sign .",
    "double chain conduction in single crystalline pr124 exhibits a strongly metallic character but no superconducting transition down to 2 k.@xcite we concentrate on single - chain rich microdomains present in the nominal pr247 as observed by tem measurements@xcite , which is probably close to the appearance of higher @xmath8= 30 k accompanied by the larger oxygen defect @xmath34 .",
    "it is , thus , expected that a reduction treatment removes oxygen from cuo single chain rich sequence such as \\{s - d - s - s - s - d } and results in higher carrier doping into its surrounding cuo double chain in comparison to that in the regular sequence \\{s - d - s - d - s - d}.    in summary , we have demonstrated the pressure effect of @xmath56 , and the transport properties of the nominal composition pr@xmath0ba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "magnetization and resistivity measurements of the @xmath17=0.94 sample reduced in vacuum exhibit @xmath4 k. the pressure dependence of @xmath8 of the @xmath34 sample strongly suggests the nearly optimum doping of the superconducting carries . comparing the effect of pressure on @xmath8 with the @xmath42 dependence of it ,",
    "we notice that the application of pressure gives rise to an increase in the carrier concentration .",
    "we believe that the heterogeneous structure of the nominal pr247 is closely related to the appearance of higher @xmath57 .",
    "seebeck coefficient of the @xmath17=0.94 sample shows a metallic conduction below 100 k and is in its temperature dependence quite different from the data of the as - sintered one , leading to a dramatic change of the density of state along the cuo metallic double chain .",
