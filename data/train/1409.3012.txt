    "magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) is the oldest known magnet and a fascinating material both for understanding the fundamental physics that emerge from electronic correlations , and for novel technologies related to oxide electronics @xcite . at ambient conditions , it crystallizes in the inverse spinel structure with cubic @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the o atoms form a fcc lattice , with fe@xmath7 atoms in tetrahedral sites acting with a nominal @xmath8 valence , and fe@xmath9 cations with @xmath10 valence in octahedral positions .",
    "the fe@xmath7 and fe@xmath9 sublattices are antiferromagnetically coupled , and the minority spin @xmath11 states of the fe@xmath9 atoms cross the fermi level , leading to a half - metallic ferrimagnet with high magnetic moment , 4 @xmath12 per formula unit ( f.u . ) .    at a critical temperature t@xmath13 k",
    ", magnetite undergoes the first - order verwey transition ( vt ) , that manifests in a structural modification to a monoclinic symmetry accompanied by a drop of the conductivity of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the conductivity is due to a freezing of the electron hopping between different octahedral fe sites , causing a charge disproportionation that results in two types of fe@xmath9 atoms acting with a slightly enhanced ( fe@xmath14 ) or reduced ( fe@xmath15 ) valence .",
    "the distribution of the different fe@xmath9 atoms at the unit cell configures the charge order ( co ) , intimately linked to the orbital order @xcite , and determines the full monoclinic @xmath16 symmetry @xcite .",
    "decades of efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the vt @xcite , and yet some puzzling fundamental aspects remain unanswered , such as the structural or electronic origin of the transition , or the extent of the short range order above t@xmath3 .",
    "the present consensus is that the phase transition is governed by electron - phonon couplings in the presence of strong electronic correlations @xcite .",
    "a local perturbation of the extended co has been recently identified in the form of trimerons : linear chains of three adjacent fe@xmath9 cations dominantly formed by a central fe@xmath15 and two fe@xmath14 , with a significant reduction of the interatomic fe - fe distances and a polaronic distribution of shared charge @xcite .",
    "trimerons reveal as the essential short - range unit in the electronic phase transitions of magnetite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , laser pump - probe experiments have created a non - equilibrium version of the vt by introducing holes in the trimeron lattice @xcite .",
    "this invokes the possibility to obtain analogs of the vt under sizes much lower than those required by a full @xmath16 cell , and in fact , as a first result of this work , we will demonstrate the ability of trimerons to emerge in a reduced unit cell of @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "one of the handicaps for the exploitation of the vt in novel technologies is the low value of t@xmath3 , well below room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "the measurement at the fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) surface of an insulating gap at rt @xcite and the further prediction that its existence was accompanied by a subsurface co similar to the bulk one @xcite , caused thus great excitement .",
    "fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) presents a @xmath2 reconstruction which corresponds to a bulk truncation at an fe@xmath9-o plane @xcite .",
    "its origin has been assigned to a jahn - teller distortion causing a wavelike displacement of the fe@xmath9 surface atoms along @xmath17 directions @xcite .",
    "seemingly this rt reconstruction is not significantly altered across the vt @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution in depth of the subsurface co has not been investigated , setting forth interrogants about the formation of surface trimerons and the relation between the surface and bulk cos below t@xmath3 .",
    "a recent study proves that the bulk low temperature phase ( ltp ) manifests at the surface in distinct structural features than the reconstruction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath2 symmetry is lost in favor of a @xmath18 structure at a temperature t@xmath19 k through a second - order transition involving loss of long - range co @xcite .",
    "these results suggest the existence of fundamental differences between the surface and bulk insulating phases .    in this work",
    "we provide firm proof of this fact , calculating the evolution with temperature of the electronic structure of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) surface .",
    "our results evidence that the surface insulating state originates from the combination of large o electron affinity and loss of o bonds , and remains unaltered across the bulk and surface transitions .",
    "this has an impact for the disappearance of trimerons close to the surface , replaced by bipolaronic structures below t@xmath4 . as a consequence",
    ", a competition between the local bulk and surface cos emerges below t@xmath3 , that manifests in modulations of the surface co arising both from bulk trimerons and from the surface reconstruction .",
    "we have performed first principles calculations of both bulk magnetite and its ( 001 ) termination , based on the density functional theory including correlation effects .",
    "we employ a plane wave basis set @xcite and the projector augmented waves ( paw ) method to describe the core electrons @xcite , with an energy cutoff of 400 ev and a monhorst - pack sampling of the brillouin zone ( bz ) of @xmath20 for the bulk and up to @xmath21 for the surface slabs , that guarantee convergence in the total energy better than 0.1 mev / f.u .",
    "we use the exchange - correlation functional parametrization of perdew - burke - erzenhof ( pbe ) , adding an effective on - site coulomb repulsion term u=4 ev @xcite .",
    "this choice of u is based on the recovery of an equilibrium value of the cubic lattice parameter @xmath22 @xmath23 in excellent agreement with experiments , and the adequate description of the verwey transition in terms of charge disproportionation ( 0.27 @xmath24 ) and electronic band gap ( 0.2 ev ) when reducing the symmetry from the cubic @xmath25 .",
    "our description of bulk magnetite is based on a @xmath5 unit cell formed by 28 atoms .",
    "we have determined the equilibrium structures above and below t@xmath3 starting from the ideal cubic lattice and allowing relaxation of the lattice vectors and atomic positions , with no symmetry constraints for the low temperature phase ( ltp ) . even at the high temperature phase ( htp )",
    "there exists a noticeable distortion of the o sublattice , that introduces a slight tetragonal deformation of the unit cell with a small reduction of the total volume of 3 @xmath26 . at the ltp , relaxation of the lattice vectors",
    "leads to an orthorhombic symmetry , but again the distortion of the unit cell is small , with a similar reduction of the total volume .    to model the fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) surface , we have used slabs of different thicknesses , containing from 8 to 16 atomic planes , supported on a au substrate and including a vacuum region of at least 12 @xmath23 that avoids interaction between opposite slab surfaces .",
    "the choice of the substrate has been performed to minimize interface effects and to confine them to the interface layer . in all cases",
    "we have employed @xmath2 two - dimensional unit cells , starting our calculations either from the @xmath18 termination or from the jahn - teller induced wavelike pattern , and allowing to relax the atomic positions of the 3 outermost surface layers until the forces on all atoms are below 0.01 ev/@xmath23 .",
    "we have done this for slabs constructed both from the htp and the ltp bulk structures .",
    "the slabs of 12 planes provide the minimum thickness to recover the bulk structure at the inner layers below t@xmath3 including the distribution of trimerons , and all the results presented here correspond to this configuration .",
    "we have also modelled thicker unsupported symmetric slabs of 16 planes to check the independence of our conclusions on the slab configuration , particularly concerning the penetration of surface effects .",
    "figure [ fbulk ] and table [ tabla - dist ] summarize our results for the density of states ( dos ) , the bader charges ( q@xmath9 ) and the interatomic distances at both the htp and the ltp of bulk magnetite .",
    "the energy barrier between both phases is 170 mev / f.u .",
    "the higher symmetry of the htp reflects in the existence of only one type of o and fe@xmath9 sites with a bond length of 2.06 @xmath23 , and in the uniform value of the fe@xmath9-fe@xmath9 interatomic distance ( d@xmath28 ) .",
    "o@xmath1 at the ( a ) htp and ( b ) ltp of bulk magnetite , showing the projections on the fe@xmath7 ( thick black ) and inequivalent fe@xmath9 ( red / blue ) sites .",
    "positive ( negative ) dos values correspond to majority ( minority ) spin projections . ]    below t@xmath3 , while fe@xmath7 remains essentially unaffected by the transition , a charge disproportionation of 0.27 @xmath24 appears in the fe@xmath9 sublattice , opening a band gap of 0.2 ev . within our reduced @xmath5 cell , the fe@xmath15 and fe@xmath14 ions alternate along the [ 001 ] direction , as evidenced in figure [ fbulk - trims ] .",
    "different values of the d@xmath29 can be found depending on the fe valence .",
    "this is accompanied by a noticeable dispersion of the fe@xmath9-o bond lengths , with larger average values for fe@xmath15 ( 2.08@xmath23 ) than for fe@xmath14 ( 2.03@xmath23 ) .",
    "the result is a non - uniform distribution of charge and magnetic moments that leads to slightly different o atoms at the fe@xmath14 ( o@xmath30 ) and fe@xmath15 ( o@xmath31 ) planes , as reflected in the dispersion of the q@xmath9 values .",

    "[ tabla - dist ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the inhomogeneities in the d@xmath29 at the ltp have important consequences for the emergence of trimerons .",
    "regarding figure [ fbulk - trims ] , every fe@xmath15 is surrounded by 4 fe@xmath14 placed at the adjacent upper and lower ( 001 ) layers .",
    "two of them are at 2.89@xmath23 ( solid colored lines ) and the other two are at 3.03@xmath23 ( dotted lines ) , while the interatomic distance between coplanar fe@xmath9 atoms is 2.95@xmath23 , as shown in table [ tabla - dist ] .",
    "this defines linear fe@xmath14-fe@xmath15-fe@xmath14 chains of shortened lengths , with a charge accumulation over 0.027 @xmath32 at the middle of each fe@xmath14-fe@xmath15 segment , in analogy with the experimental features assigned to trimerons @xcite .",
    "the orbital character of the electronic states confirms the polaronic charge distribution , with the occupied fe@xmath15 @xmath11 minority spin states lying along the central axis of the chain and inducing a small contribution of the same orbital character at the closer fe@xmath14 .",
    "trimerons are uniquely characterized by the coexistence of all these features @xmath33short d@xmath29 ( @xmath34 @xmath23 ) , enhanced charge accumulation ( @xmath35 e/@xmath26 ) and orbital directionality@xmath33 , as confirmed by exploring alternative solutions without co along the ( 001 ) direction where trimerons do not form . moreover ,",
    "the existence of these solutions points to the complex link between the long- and short - range cos @xcite .",
    "we have observed that , already under a cubic lattice , the reduced @xmath5 unit cell is enough for the verwey metal - insulator transition to emerge , merely by relaxing the symmetry constraints of the htp in the presence of electronic correlations ( u@xmath36 ev ) @xcite .",
    "the additional full relaxation of the lattice vectors and atomic positions introduces a slight orthorhombic distortion at the ltp , and is accompanied by the formation of the local trimeron structures .",
    "this links the metal - insulator transition to the extended co , and separates it from the short - range correlations , in good agreement with recent evidence @xcite .",
    "though the intricate relation between the different cos can only be ultimately integrated under the full @xmath16 symmetry , the results presented in this section prove that our reduced unit cell contains the main features of the charge distribution at the ltp : a dominant co along the @xmath37 $ ] axis @xcite , and the existence of trimerons as short - range features that are distinct to the low temperature co but intimately connected to it .",
    "this supports the use of the @xmath5 cell as a basis to explore the surface properties below t@xmath3 .",
    "we will first focus on the unreconstructed surface of the htp above t@xmath4 .",
    "a sketch of the structure corresponding to our ground state is depicted in figure [ fsurf - struc1 ] , where layers are numbered from the surface ( l1 ) towards the bulk . as each surface",
    "o atom has lost one donor neighbor , they reduce the bond lengths to the remaining fe@xmath9 cations to @xmath38 @xmath23 in order to recover the bulk - like charge .",
    "this leads to a significant rearrangement of the atomic positions , where the compression of the first interlayer distance ( d@xmath39 @xmath23 , to be compared to the bulk value @xmath40 @xmath23 ) is followed by the expansion of the subsequent interlayer spacings ( d@xmath41 @xmath23 , d@xmath42 @xmath23 ) .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fsurf - struc1 ] , at l1 there are two types of o sites , either bonded to a subsurface fe@xmath9 ( o@xmath9 ) or to fe@xmath7 ( o@xmath7 ) .",
    "in order to avoid the excessive shortening of the o - fe@xmath7 distance , the o@xmath7 atoms move outwards , inducing at l1 a large corrugation of 0.11 @xmath23 and a slight in - plane wavelike distortion of the o rows .",
    "the asymmetry persists at l3 , where the o corrugation attenuates to 0.04 @xmath23 . while fe@xmath7 remains essentially unaffected by the large distortion of the o sublattice , the opposite occurs for the fe@xmath9 at the two outermost layers , l1 and l3 .",
    "each fe@xmath9 along the surface @xmath43 $ ] and subsurface @xmath44 $ ] rows approaches one of their adjacent fe neighbors at the cost of farthening from the opposite . as shown in figure [ fsurf - struc1](b ) , the movement is more pronounced at the subsurface .",
    "o@xmath1(001 ) surface above t@xmath4 .",
    "panel ( b ) only shows the 3 outermost planes , indicating the different in - plane fe@xmath9-fe@xmath9 distances in @xmath23 .",
    "also , for clarity , the leftmost surface row of o atoms is not depicted . ]",
    "-o planes of figure [ fsurf - struc1 ] , providing the corresponding q@xmath9 .",
    "]    the result of this restructuration in the electronic properties can be seen in figure [ fsurf - struc ] , that provides the atomic - resolved dos and the corresponding q@xmath9 at the outermost fe@xmath9-o planes , where all surface effects are contained .",
    "although the o charges show significant dispersion , the differences are not apparent in the dos , and their q@xmath9 are close to bulk values throughout the structure .",
    "the fe@xmath9 atoms at l1 behave as fe@xmath14 , opening an insulating gap . however , the emergence of the gap is not accompanied by any charge disproportionation at the fe@xmath9 sublattice .",
    "a gradual recovery of bulk - like behavior starts at l3 , and is almost restored at l5 . as our slabs are not completely free from confinement effects , we can not discard that it could be restored even at l3 , as inferred from stm observations of the structure of antiphase boundaries ( apb ) @xcite .",
    "it is also important to remark that although uncompensated and slightly enhanced magnetic moments emerge at the surface plane ( 4.16@xmath12 for fe , 0.4@xmath12 for o ) , the antiferromagnetic coupling between the fe@xmath7 and fe@xmath9 sublattices remains unaltered .",
    "this preserves the bulk - like high magnetic moment of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 also at the high temperature surface , validating it as a promising material for spintronics applications .     for the htp below t@xmath4 .",
    "values of the fe@xmath9-fe@xmath9 distances in @xmath23 are provided ( a ) between planes and ( b ) along the surface and subsurface fe@xmath9 rows .",
    "arrows in ( b ) are a guide to indicate the wavelike displacements of surface fe , and only the central row of surface o atoms is depicted for clarity . ]    when the temperature is lowered below t@xmath4 , the @xmath45 reconstruction sets in .",
    "this surface has already been studied in detail , but there are yet controversies about the origin of the reconstruction and its dependence on electronic correlations @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that all effects described for the unreconstructed surface are still present below t@xmath4 , with only minor modificationis of d@xmath46 and d@xmath47 of less than 0.04 @xmath23 , and slightly more asymmetric fe - o coordination units .",
    "figure [ fsurf - is2-dos1 ] shows a sketch of the structure and figure [ fsurf - is2-dos ] the corresponding dos and q@xmath9 at the 3 outermost fe@xmath9-o planes . the most relevant feature introduced by the reconstruction is the emergence of a charge disproportionation of @xmath48@xmath24 between fe sites at l3 , that defines a co pattern within the ( 001 ) plane reducing the dispersion of o charges .",
    "this subsurface co was already proposed on the basis of purely electronic effects @xcite .",
    "however , we obtain that the atomic wavelike displacement at the surface fe rows lowers the energy by 28 mev / f.u . with respect to the @xmath18 surface also in the presence of electronic correlations .",
    "reminiscence of this co persists at l5 , though half - metallicity is recovered .",
    "in fact , we can not discard some penetration of the surface effects at deeper layers in real samples , where the existence of defects or apb may contribute to alterations of the co , as the energy barrier between different charge distributions is of only a few mev @xcite .     for the structure in figure [ fsurf - is2-dos1 ] .",
    "]    from these results it is clear that the surface transition arises from the interplay between co and electron - lattice couplings , as already proposed on the basis of thermodynamic models @xcite .",
    "but although an insulating and charge - ordered state exists below t@xmath4 , the surface introduces significant differences with the bulk ltp . at l3 ,",
    "the fe charge and dos width are influenced by the demand of charge from surface o , and show reduced values with respect to the bulk fe@xmath14 and fe@xmath15 .",
    "more important , as we will prove now , neither the surface structure nor the orbital character of the surface @xmath11 states support the definition of trimerons .",
    "regarding figure [ fsurf - is2-dos1 ] , the wavelike fe@xmath9 surface displacements define narrow and wide regions occupied respectively by fe@xmath15 and fe@xmath14 . as a result , along each subsurface @xmath44 $ ] row , pairs of fe@xmath15 and fe@xmath14 alternate , inhibiting the formation of linear fe@xmath14-fe@xmath15-fe@xmath14 chains within the ( 001 ) plane .",
    "eventhough the longitudinal movement of the surface fe@xmath9 along ( 110 ) rows ( not shown in the figure ) is similar to that above t@xmath4 , at the subsurface the displacement of fe@xmath14 is suppressed , originating shortened d@xmath29=2.70 @xmath23 between fe@xmath15-fe@xmath15 and large d@xmath29=3.09 @xmath23 between fe@xmath14-fe@xmath15 .",
    "this leads to in - plane charge sharing between fe@xmath15 sites , forming a kind of localized bipolarons @xcite with a large charge accumulation of 0.035 @xmath32 , but opposes to the structure of bulk trimerons .",
    "this tendency persists with respect to the adjacent planes : as shown in figure [ fsurf - is2-dos1](a ) , the d@xmath29 to the fe@xmath9 neighbors at l1 is similar for fe@xmath14 and fe@xmath15 , and much larger than 2.70 @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the fe@xmath9 closer to subsurface fe@xmath14 ( fe@xmath15 ) at l5 are those of fe@xmath14 ( fe@xmath15 ) type , and are also farther than 2.70 @xmath23 . in conclusion , neither the interatomic distances nor the charge distribution arising from the surface reconstruction support the formation of bulk - like trimerons .",
    "the different nature of the low temperature surface and bulk phases discards that the @xmath2 reconstruction acts as the first stage for the development of the vt .",
    "however , it suggests the possibility of a competition between surface and bulk cos below t@xmath3 . in order to explore this",
    ", we have modelled the fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) surface of the ltp departing from our @xmath5 bulk unit cell .",
    "although this cell contains limited information of the actual long - range co , we will show that yet important insights about the mutual influence of the bulk and surface short - range correlations become evident .",
    "-ended fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) surface below t@xmath3 , indicating the bulk - like trimerons and providing selected d@xmath29 values ( in @xmath23 ) . ]     ( blue ) , fe@xmath15 ( red ) and o ( black ) atoms of the structure in figure [ fsurf - is01 ] . ]    the surface can be constructed exposing either fe@xmath14 or fe@xmath15 planes , which has implications for the continuity of bulk trimerons close to the surface , as shown in figures [ fsurf - is01 ] and [ fsurf - is0-fe3+str ] .",
    "the most stable situation by @xmath49 mev / f.u . corresponds to the fe@xmath15-ended case in figure [ fsurf - is01 ] , that at difference with the fe@xmath14 termination , preserves the bulk co up to the subsurface .",
    "this energy difference is much larger than that between the @xmath2 and @xmath18 surfaces at high temperatures , evidencing the high impact of the bulk co on the surface properties .",
    "we have estimated that the loss of the bulk co at the subsurface lowers the work function by 0.30 ev , a variation close to that induced by the adsorption of water @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , surface effects are similar to those at the htp under both terminations : an insulating fe@xmath14 surface layer , shortened surface o - fe@xmath9 bonds , and a similar pattern of outermost interlayer distances and longitudinal atomic displacements within the fe@xmath9 rows .",
    "this helps to attain bulk values of the o charge , though the surface causes an additional dispersion in q@xmath9 , as shown in figures [ fsurf - is0 ] and [ fsurf - is0-fe3 + ] for the fe@xmath15- and fe@xmath14-ended cases , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , at the fe@xmath15 termination the same electronic structure corresponds to the @xmath18 and @xmath2 surfaces , separated by less than 7 mev / f.u .",
    "this is because the ltp bulk structure introduces an additional charge modulation within ( 001 ) planes , that obscures that induced by the reconstruction : regarding figure [ fsurf - is01 ] , half of the fe@xmath14 sites at l3 would develop trimerons with the upper fe@xmath9 , but these have changed their valence inhibiting the polaronic charge distribution . as the other half participate in trimerons with the layers below , two types of fe@xmath9 sites exist at the subsurface , with similar dos but slightly different q@xmath9 and interatomic distances to the surface fe@xmath9 .",
    "again this proves the influence of the bulk co on the surface properties below t@xmath3 .     for the fe@xmath14-ended surface of the ltp .",
    "]     for the structure in figure [ fsurf - is0-fe3+str ] . ]    in turn , the robust insulating surface layer , which seems to be a universal feature of magnetite even under metastable terminations @xcite , has an important local effect on the bulk co. this better manifests at the fe@xmath14 termination in figures [ fsurf - is0-fe3+str ] and [ fsurf - is0-fe3 + ] , where the lack of continuity of the trimerons at the subsurface allows for the emergence of localized bipolarons , indicating the possible coexistence of local surface and bulk cos . but figure [ fsurf - is01 ] evidences that also at the fe@xmath15 termination those trimerons closer to the surface are slightly affected by it : the fe@xmath14-fe@xmath15 distances between l3 and l5 are moderately enlarged , which introduces an asymmetry in the fe chain weakening the charge sharing in its upper branch . in summary , though preservation of the bulk co seems to have a dominant effect on the surface stability , it is conditioned by the insulating fe@xmath14 surface layer , and there is a mutual influence of the bulk and surface properties that extends several layers below the surface plane .",
    "our results prove that the fe@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) surface shows a robust insulating state that persists across the surface and bulk phase transitions .",
    "it is originated by the large demand of charge from surface o arising from bond breaking , and causes a significant restructuration at the outermost planes that inhibits the formation of trimerons .",
    "below t@xmath4 , a surface co distinct from that of the bulk ltp emerges .",
    "its distinct nature manifests in a lower charge disproportionation as compared to the bulk ltp , and in the preferential bipolaronic co within ( 001 ) planes .",
    "when the temperature is lowered below t@xmath3 , this surface co competes with the dominant bulk one .",
    "this competition is conditioned by the insulating fe@xmath14 character of the surface , which weakens the trimeron structures .",
    "besides its intrinsic interest , the relation between co and dimensionality has implications for the multifunctional properties of magnetite , since the emergence of ferroelectric polarization @xcite , the orientation of the magnetic easy axis @xcite or the catalytic activity @xcite are related to the existence of different fe@xmath9 sites and the resulting charge distribution .",
    "direct evidence from surface measurements is challenging , as most effects will manifest at the subsurface level .",
    "additional complications emerge from the existence of apb in real samples , and from differences in the relative orientation of the monoclinic and cubic crystal axes in single crystals and thin films . from the theoretical side , the inclusion of the full @xmath16 symmetry , with additional modulations of the co within ( 001 ) planes ,",
    "may show an even richer scenario .",
    "however , our results unequivocally demonstrate the existence of a mutual influence of the surface and bulk cos , providing and partially quantifying the main features involved in it .",
    "we hope they will motivate further work in this fascinating subject .",
