    "star formation is regulated by many physical factors , with processes from sub - pc to super - kpc scales contributing to setting the overall rate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the key factors expected to control the star formation rate is the available supply of gas . over the whole range of star - forming systems , from entire spiral galaxies to circumnuclear starbursts , the global average of the surface density of star formation , @xmath0 ,",
    "is observed to be correlated with the global average of the neutral gas surface density @xmath1 as @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent observations at high spatial resolution have made it possible to investigate local , rather than global , correlations of the star formation rate with @xmath1 , using either azimuthal averages over rings , or mapping with apertures down to @xmath7 scales ( e.g. ) . while power - law @xcite relationships are still evident in these local studies , steeper slopes are found for the outer , atomic - dominated regions of spiral galaxies ( as well as dwarf galaxies ) compared to the inner , molecular - dominated regions of spirals .",
    "in addition , measured indices in the low-@xmath1 , low-@xmath0 regime vary considerably from one galaxy to another .",
    "thus , no single schmidt law characterizes the regulation of star formation on local scales in the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "the nonlinearity of observed schmidt laws implies that not just the quantity of gas , but also its physical state and the surrounding galactic environment , affect the star formation rate .",
    "indices @xmath8 imply that the star formation efficiency is higher in higher - density regions , which are generally nearer the centers of galaxies and have shorter dynamical times .",
    "indeed , the expectation based on theory and numerical simulations @xcite in thin , single - phase gaseous disks is that gravitational instabilities leading to star formation would grow only if the toomre parameter @xcite @xmath9 is sufficiently small .",
    "these instabilities would develop over a timescale comparable to the galactic orbital time @xmath10 , which corresponds to about twice the two - dimensional jeans time @xmath11 when @xmath12 is near - critical . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the thermal speed ( @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the gas thermal pressure , density , and temperature ) , and @xmath18 is the epicyclic frequency ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "while the implied scaling @xmath20 is roughly satisfied globally @xcite , supporting the notion that galaxies evolve towards states with @xmath12 roughly near - critical ( e.g. @xcite ) , for more local observations this does not provide an accurate prediction of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to galactic rotation and shear rates , an important aspect of local galactic environment is the gravity of the stellar component .",
    "the background stellar gravity compresses the disk vertically ( affecting the three - dimensional jeans time @xmath21 ) , and perturbations in the stellar density can act in concert with gaseous perturbations in gravitational instabilities ( altering the effective @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus , one might expect the stellar surface density @xmath22 and/or volume density @xmath23 to affect the star formation rate ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , if the stellar vertical gravity dominates that of the gas ( see  2 for a detailed discussion of this ) , a scaling @xmath24 would imply @xmath25 for a constant - temperature gas disk .",
    "although star formation does appear to be correlated with @xmath22 ( e.g. @xcite ; see also below ) , the simple scaling @xmath26 ( taking into account both gaseous and stellar gravity , and assuming constant @xmath13 , in calculating @xmath27 ) does not in fact provide an accurate local prediction of star formation rates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a likely reason for the inaccuracy of the simple star formation prescriptions described above is that they do not account for the multiphase character of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , in which most of the volume is filled with low - density warm ( or hot ) gas but much ( or even most ) of the mass is found in clouds at densities two or more orders of magnitude greater than that of the intercloud medium . for the colder ( atomic and molecular ) phases ,",
    "the turbulent velocity dispersions are much larger than @xmath13 , so that the mean gas density @xmath28 averaged over the disk thickness depends on the turbulent vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "even when multiphase gas and turbulence ( and stellar and gas gravity ) are taken into account in simulations , however , the simple estimate @xmath29 ( using @xmath30 directly measured from the simulations ) yields schmidt - law indices steeper than the true values measured in both the simulations and in real galaxies @xcite . perhaps this should not be surprising , since one would expect the proportions of gas among different phases , as well as the overall vertical distribution , to affect the star formation rate . if , for example , most of the ism s mass were in clouds of fixed internal density that formed stars at a fixed rate , then increasing the vertical velocity dispersion of this system of clouds would lower @xmath30 but leave @xmath0 unchanged .",
    "the relative proportions of gas among different phases seems difficult to calculate from first principles , because it depends on how self - gravitating molecular clouds form and how they are destroyed , both of which are very complex processes .",
    "intriguingly , however , analysis of recent observations of spiral galaxies has shown that the surface density of the molecular component averaged over @xmath31 annuli or local patches shows a relatively simple overall behavior , increasing roughly linearly with the empirically - estimated midplane gas pressure @xcite .",
    "the physical reason behind this empirical relation has not , however , yet been explained .    in this paper",
    ", we use a simple physical model to analyze how the gas is partitioned into diffuse and self - gravitating components , based on considerations of dynamic and thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we develop the idea that the midplane pressure in the diffuse component must simultaneously satisfy constraints imposed by vertical force balance , and by balance between heating ( primarily from uv ) and cooling .",
    "in particular , we propose that the approximately linear empirical relation between molecular content and midplane pressure identified by @xcite arises because the equilibrium gas pressure is approximately proportional to the uv heating rate ; since the mean uv intensity is proportional to the star formation rate and the star formation rate is proportional to the molecular mass in normal spirals , the observed relationship naturally emerges .",
    "we use our analysis to predict the dependence of the star formation rate on the local gas , stellar , and dark matter content of disks , and compare our predictions with observations .",
    "the analysis , including our basic assumptions and observational motivation for parameters that enter the theory , is set out in  2 .",
    "section 3 then compares to the observed data set previously presented in @xcite . in  4 , we summarize and discuss our main results .",
    "in this section , we construct a local steady - state model for the star formation rate in the disk , with independent variables the total surface density of neutral gas ( @xmath1 ) , the midplane stellar density ( @xmath23 ) , and the dark matter density ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the latter two quantities enter only through their effect on the vertical gravitational field . to develop this model",
    ", we suppose that the diffuse gas filling most of the volume of the interstellar medium is in an equilibrium state .",
    "the equilibrium in the diffuse ism has two aspects : force balance in the vertical direction ( with a sum of pressure forces offsetting a sum of gravitational forces ) , and balance between heating and cooling ( where heating is dominated by the fuv ) .",
    "star - forming clouds , because they are self - gravitating entities at much higher pressure than their surroundings , are treated as separate from the space - filling diffuse ism .",
    "the abundance of gravitationally - bound , star - forming clouds is nevertheless important for establishing an equilibrium state in the diffuse gas , because the fuv that heats the diffuse ism originates in young ob associations .",
    "we assume ( consistent with observations and numerical simulations ) that the equilibrium thermal state established for the diffuse medium includes both warm and cold atomic gas .",
    "this hypothesis leads to a connection between the dynamical equilibrium state and the thermal equilibrium state : there are two separate constraints on the pressure that must be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "these conditions are met by an appropriate partition of the available neutral gas into diffuse and self - gravitating components .",
    "the reason for the partition between diffuse and self - gravitating gas can be understood by considering the physical requirements for equilibrium .",
    "the specific heating rate ( @xmath33 ) in the diffuse gas is proportional to the star formation rate , which is proportional to the amount of gas that has settled out of the vertically - dispersed diffuse gas and collected into self - gravitating clouds .",
    "the specific cooling rate ( @xmath34 ) in the diffuse gas is proportional to the density and hence to the thermal pressure , which ( if force balance holds ) is proportional to the vertical gravity and to the total surface density of diffuse gas . thus , an equilibrium state , in which cooling balances heating and pressure balances gravity , can be obtained by a suitable division of the gas mass into star - forming ( gravitationally - bound ) and diffuse components such that their ratio is proportional to the vertical gravitational field .",
    "if too large a fraction of the total surface density is in diffuse gas , the pressure will be too high , while the star formation rate will be too low .",
    "in this situation , the cooling would exceed heating , and mass would `` drop out '' of the diffuse component to produce additional star - forming gas . with additional star formation , the fuv intensity would raise the heating rate in the diffuse gas until it matches the cooling .    in the remainder of this section , we formalize these ideas mathematically , first defining terms (  [ section - components ] ) , then considering the requirements of dynamical balance (  [ section - momentum ] ) and thermal balance (  [ section - energy ] ) , and finally combining these to obtain an expression for the star formation rate when both equilibria are satisfied (  [ section - sf - solution ] ) .",
    "we then discuss , from a physical point of view , how the various feedback processes might act to adjust the system over time , steering it toward the equilibrium we have identified (  [ section - approach ] ) .",
    "while evolving to an equilibrium of this kind is plausible , we emphasize that this is an assumption of the present model , which must be tested by detailed time - dependent simulations .",
    "a worked example applying the model to an idealized galaxy is presented in ",
    "[ section - ideal ] . in developing the present model ,",
    "we have adopted a number of simplifications that a more refined treatment should address ; we enumerate several of these issues in  [ sec - consider ] .      in this model , we divide the neutral ism into two components .",
    "one component consists of the gas that is collected into gravitationally - bound clouds ( gbcs ) localized near the galactic midplane , with mean surface density ( averaged over @xmath35 kpc scales ) of @xmath36 .",
    "the other component consists of gas that is diffuse ( i.e. not gravitationally bound ) , with mean surface density @xmath37 . here",
    ", we use the term `` diffuse '' in the sense of being widely dispersed or scattered throughout the volume ; the diffuse component may include both tenuous , volume - filling gas and small , dense cloudlets ( see below ) .",
    "all star formation is assumed to take place within the gbc component . in normal galaxies ,",
    "the gbc component is identified with the population of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "note that while observed gmcs in the milky way consist primarily of molecular gas , they also contain atomic gas in shielding layers .",
    "more generally , as we shall discuss further below , the relative proportions of molecular and dense atomic gas in gbcs depends on the cloud column and metallicity , and gbcs could even be primarily atomic if the metallicity is sufficiently low .",
    "the diffuse component is identified ( in normal galaxies ) with the atomic ism .",
    "we treat the diffuse gas as a two - phase cloud - intercloud medium in thermal pressure equilibrium , with turbulent vertical velocity dispersion @xmath38 assumed to be the same for warm and cold phases .",
    "although the cold cloudlets within the diffuse component have much higher internal density than the warm intercloud gas , they are ( by definition ) each of sufficiently low mass that they are non - self - gravitating , such that their thermal pressure ( approximately ) matches that of their surroundings .",
    "the pressure in the interior of gbcs is considerably higher than the pressure of the surrounding diffuse gas ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in reality",
    ", the diffuse gas would not have a single unique pressure even if the radiative heating rate is constant because of time - dependent dynamical effects : turbulent compressions and rarefactions heat and cool the gas , altering what would otherwise be a balance between radiative heating and cooling processes .",
    "nevertheless , simulations of turbulent gas with atomic - ism heating and cooling indicate that the majority of the gas has pressure within @xmath39 of the mean value @xcite , although the breadth of the pressure peak depends on the timescale of turbulent forcing @xmath40 compared to the cooling time .",
    "observations indicate a range of pressures in the cold atomic gas in the solar neighborhood , with a small fraction of the gas at very high pressures , and @xmath39 of the gas at pressures within @xmath39 of the mean value @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the volume - weighted mean thermal pressure at the midplane is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the volume - weighted mean midplane density of diffuse gas .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is the mass - weighted mean thermal velocity dispersion ; for a medium with warm and cold gas with respective mass fractions ( in the diffuse component ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 and temperatures @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the thermal speed of warm gas . since the ratio @xmath50 is typically @xmath51 , @xmath52 unless @xmath44 is extremely small .    if the thermal pressure in the warm and cold diffuse gas phases are the same , @xmath53 , so that from equations ( [ pth_vol ] ) and ( [ vth - eq ] ) , @xmath54 this result still holds approximately even if the warm and cold medium pressures differ somewhat , since the warm gas fills most of the volume , @xmath55 . note that one can also write @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 the total and warm - medium volumes , so that @xmath52 provided the warm medium fills most of the volume . if the medium is all cold gas , @xmath59",
    "henceforth , we shall assume the warm and cold gas pressures are equal at the midplane so that @xmath60 ; for convenience , we shall also omit the subscript on @xmath43 .      by averaging the momentum equation of the diffuse component horizontally and in time , and integrating outward from the midplane , it is straightforward to show that the difference in the total vertical momentum flux across the disk thickness ( i.e. between midplane and @xmath61 ) must be equal to the total weight of the diffuse gas ( e.g. @xcite ) . this total weight has three terms .",
    "the first term is the weight of the diffuse gas in its own gravitational field , @xmath62 where we have used @xmath63 for a slab .",
    "the second term is the weight of the diffuse gas in the mean gravitational field associated with the gbcs , @xmath64 where we have assumed that the scale height of the gbc distribution is much smaller than that of the diffuse gas so that @xmath65 over most of the integral .",
    "note that equation ( [ gas_weight_gbc ] ) gives an upper bound on this term in the weight , with a lower bound given by @xmath66 , corresponding to the case in which the vertical distributions of the diffuse and gravitationally - bound components are the same .",
    "the third term is the weight in the gravitational field associated with the disk stars plus dark matter , @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the midplane density of the stellar disk plus that of the dark matter halo ; we have assumed a flat rotation curve @xmath69 for the dark halo so that @xmath70 . with @xmath71 ,",

    "note that if the toomre parameter for the stellar disk and the vertical - to - horizontal velocity dispersion ratio are both constant with radius , then @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", the ratio of the gas - to - stellar scale height is @xmath76 ; since the gas can dissipate turbulence and cool to maintain constant @xmath77 while the stellar velocity dispersion secularly increases over time , the gas layer will tend to be thinner than the stellar layer even if both components flare in the outer parts of galaxies . ]",

    "allowing for a gradient in the vertical stellar density within the gas distribution , the stellar contribution to the weight would be reduced by a factor @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the gaseous and stellar scale heights . in the ( unlikely ) circumstance",
    "that the diffuse - gas scale height is much larger than that of the stars , @xmath85 would be substituted for the gravity of the stellar component , yielding a contribution analogous to that in equation ( [ gas_weight_gbc ] ) with @xmath86 .    including both thermal and kinetic terms , and taking @xmath87 at the top of the diffuse - gas layer , the difference in the gaseous vertical momentum flux between @xmath88 and @xmath61 is given by @xmath89 .",

    "these magnetic terms are volume - weighted ; both observations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite indicate that field strengths in the warm and cold atomic medium are similar .",

    "is regulated such that uv radiation created by young stars heats the disk just as much as is needed for the thermal pressure in the diffuse gas to meet the requirements imposed by vertical force balance .",
    "the regulation process depends on mass exchange between self - gravitating and diffuse components of the ism such that star formation at the required rate can take place in the bound clouds . since the star formation rate in normal galaxies is proportional to the mass in gravitationally bound gmcs , we believe that this self - regulation mechanism is the physical basis for the relationship between molecular surface density and midplane pressure empirically identified by @xcite .",
    "the theoretical relationship we obtain is in fact slightly different from the empirical formula of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they found that the ratio of molecular - to - atomic surface densities is approximately proportional to an estimate of the total midplane pressure for a composite ism ( see  [ sec - obs ] for details ) , whereas here we argue that the surface density of gas contained in gbcs should be proportional to the midplane thermal pressure in the diffuse gas . while physically and mathematically different , the two relationships yield quantitatively similar values of @xmath0 provided the atomic surface density is relatively uniform ( as is true in the observations of @xcite and @xcite ) , the ratio of thermal to total pressure is relatively constant , and the gas in gbcs is mostly molecular . in particular ,",

    "the present model is limited to the regime in which star - forming clouds have `` normal '' properties , similar to those observed in the disks of local group galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "observationally , a difficulty ( particularly in low metallicity regions ) is that significant gas can be `` dark '' @xcite  i.e. not observable either in hi ( because the hydrogen is molecular ) or in co ( because the carbon is atomic ) . for solar metallicity and clouds with @xmath407 ,",
