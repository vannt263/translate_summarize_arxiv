    "<S> in this paper , a novel parallel hybrid iterative method is proposed for finding a common element of the set of solutions of a system of equilibrium problems , the set of solutions of variational inequalities for inverse strongly monotone mappings and the set of fixed points of a finite family of nonexpansive mappings in hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> strong convergence theorem is proved for the sequence generated by the scheme . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a parallel iterative algorithm for two finite families of variational inequalities and nonexpansive mappings is established . </S>"
