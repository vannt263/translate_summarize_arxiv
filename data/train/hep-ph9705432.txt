    "could be produced in a unit rapidity interval .",
    "if the number of bosons in a unit value of phase - space is large enough the bosons may condense into the same quantum state and a pion laser could be created  @xcite . similarly to this process , when a large number of bosonic atoms are collected in a magnetic trap and cooled down to increase their density in phase - space , the bosonic nature of the atoms reveals itself in the formation of a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite which can be considered as a macroscopic quantum state .",
    "this condensation mechanism may provide the key to the formation of atomic lasers in condensed matter physics .",
    "thus it is essential to understand how the quantum statistical properties of a dilute bosonic gas change if the density of the quanta increases . in terms of multi - particle wave packet states",
    "this corresponds to the increase of the overlap of the single - particle wave - packets and this is indeed the key mechanism in our picture to provide the bose - einstein condensation effects . due to the fact that the quanta in high energy physics are created by well localized sources",
    ", we would like to avoid the plane - wave approximation and utilize wave - packets instead .",
    "in case of the bose condensation of atomic vapors , the presence of the magnetic trap prohibits the application of the outgoing plane - waves .",
    "we hope that the wave packet formalism , presented herewith , may have certain applications in that area of condensed matter physics as well , due to the finiteness of the wave - packet sources .",
    "however , we will not explore this possibility in details herewith , since our main motivation for considering the problem of quantum statistical correlations for many hundreds of overlapping wave - packets stems from the experimental program in high energy heavy ion physics , which itself has been motivated by a search for a new phase of the strongly interacting matter .",

    "we will utilize wave packets in order to resolve the clear contradiction of the classical assumptions in some models of bose - einstein correlations with the tenets of quantum mechanics .",
    "although certain properties of the wave - packets have been already utilized in previous publications  @xcite , these were usually applied on a phenomenological level , utilizing e.g. minimal wave packets on the single particle level to mimic the effects of the uncertainty relations .",
    "however , in our case , we shall consider the problems arising from the overlap between different wave - packets , we shall discuss , how a poisson multiplicity distribution is gradually transformed to a multiplicity distribution of a bose - einstein condensate for a suitable choice of the wave packet size .",

    "the wave - packet state with zero mean momentum will be populated with a very large number of particles_. due to the optical coherence of the bosons in the zero mean momentum wave - packet state , this system is sometimes referred to as a laser , c.f . the term  pion - laser \" introduced by s. pratt in ref .",

    "this effect is larger as the mean momentum of the two pions decreases . _",
    "ii ) _ the intercept value , @xmath213 , decreases as @xmath82 is increased from 1 fm to 4 fm , and increases again as @xmath212 is further increased .",
    "these effects are caused by the increase and decrease of pion density within the `` virtual volume '' , which is influenced by the distance to onset of the divergence of the mean multiplicity , i.e. the onset of the laser ( or condensation ) mode .",
    "finally , we may conclude , that we have found interesting effects for the investigated system .",
    "the construction of a clear connection of these effects to the onset of bose - einstein condensation as it is known in statistical physics , is to be made .",
    "further , the problem , whether our approach is a useful one for the bose - einstein condensation of atomic systems ,  @xcite , remains also for future investigations .",
    "such studies may be promising since the atoms have to be trapped with the help of a magnetic trap to cool them below the critical temperature .",
    "the usual theoretical description uses the non - linear schrdinger equation where a potential is created from @xmath214 . because of the trap , plane wave states can not be utilized .",
    "thus the wave - packet description , presented in this paper may have a relevance also in the field of bose - einstein condensation of atomic vapors .",

    "here we collect some formulas for another type of factorization of the @xmath0-particle density matrix .    for the @xmath0-particle density matrix we also may assume , that it is factorizable in a simple way : _",
    "n(_1, ... ,_n ) = _ i=1^n ( _ i ) this choice of the density matrix is one of the possibilities . in the body of the paper we study an other case",
    "where the integrations can be carried out much easier , referred to as  model a \" in the forthcoming . in this appendix",
    ", we explore the consequences of  model b \" , where the integrals are much more difficult and the calculation can be performed only in some approximate manner .",
    "although in this general case one obtains quite complicated integrals when evaluating the momentum distribution , because of the overlapping of the wave packets , we can still proceed a little further with these expressions .",
    "both in case of model a and b , these integrals for the @xmath15-pion momentum distribution for fixed multiplicity @xmath0 contain the factor given by eq .",
    "( [ e : expec2 ] ) .    in case of model",
    "b , the two - particle momentum distribution is given as @xmath215 while in case model a , the integrals become somewhat simpler due to the cancelation of the extra factor in the density matrix with the denominator of the expectation value in eq .",
    "[ e : expec2 ]      in case of model b , the integrals defining the spectrum and the two - particle distributions can also be reduced to a superposition of integrals , which contain only gaussian factors , using an expansion of the denominator in the integrand . when all @xmath10 -s are equal , the denominator reaches its maximum with maximum value of @xmath216 .",
    "thus one can expand it in the absolutely convergent series : = 1n ! ( 1-x ) = 1n ! _",

    "k,_k this expansion is absolutely convergent in terms of @xmath105 in its domain . since @xmath218 contains linear combinations of different powers of @xmath219 factors , which are themselves gaussian factors , their powers",
    "are also gaussian and since all the remaining factors in the integrals were gaussian , we are left with gaussian integrals . however ,",
    "these results are rather complicated even in the @xmath220 case and we do not include them in the present work . due to the greater analytical simplicity of model a , we have explicitly evaluated integrals only for this latter case , as was given in the body of the paper .",
