    "to investigate the long distance properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , many approaches are proposed , such as lattice gauge theory , qcd sum rules , chiral perturbation theory and phenomenological quark models .",
    "each of these approaches has both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for example , lattice calculations are rigorous from the point of view of qcd , but they suffer from lattice artifacts and uncertainties connected with the necessary extrapolation to the physical quark masses .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach , introduced by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite in 1979 , tries to incorporate nonperturbative elements of full qcd . as the starting point",
    ", operator product expansion ( ope ) method was used to expand the time ordered currents into a series of quark and gluon condensates which parameterize the long distance properties , while the short distance effects are incorporated in the wilson coefficients . however",
    ", these elements ( condensates ) can not yet be calculated rigorously in qcd , and they are determined from experimental data in the one or other way ( for example , the quark condensate can be determined from experimental data with the help of gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xcite . )",
    "; moreover , although for medium and asymptotic momentum transfers the ope method can be applied for form factors and the moments of wave functions @xcite , at low momentum transfer , the standard ope method can not be consistently applied , ) which determine the wilson coefficients and long distances ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) which govern the condensates .",
    "when the transformed momentum @xmath5 is small , the standard expansion in @xmath6 would lead to a divergent result . ] as pointed out in the early work on photon couplings at low momentum for the nucleon magnetic moments @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the problem was solved by using a two point correlator in an external electromagnetic field , with vacuum susceptibilities introduced as parameters for nonperturbative propagation in the external field .",
    "in fact , the existence and magnitude of the vacuum susceptibilities are by themselves an important physical information about the structure of the vacuum and have many applications @xcite . as nonperturbative vacuum properties",
    ", the susceptibilities can be introduced for both small and large momentum transfers in the external fields . in ref.@xcite , with the long distance effects treated by bilocal power corrections and assumption of @xmath7 meson dominance , the authors circumvent the problem using a three point formulation . for detailed discussion of the relationship between three point and two point external field treatments and the origin of the susceptibilities , one can see ref .",
    "the two point method , however , has two main problems : it can not be used to extend the coupling to medium and high momentum transfer and there are additional parameters to be determined , the vacuum susceptibilities . in ref.@xcite , by comparing terms appearing in the two point external field expression with those in hybrid expansion of the three point function , the authors obtain a relationship between the nonperturbative elements in the two methods . from these relationships",
    ", one can express the induced susceptibilities of the two point method in terms of well - defined four quark vacuum matrix elements .",
    "these susceptibilities may play an important role in the qcd sum rules approach .",
    "in particular , the strong and parity - violating pion - nucleon coupling depends crucially on the @xmath2 vacuum susceptibility ( @xmath8 ) , while the tensor vacuum susceptibilities are relevant for the determination of the tensor charge of the nucleon , which is connected through deep - inelastic sum rules to the leading - twist nucleon structure functions and transversity distribution @xcite . although in principle the pion susceptibility can be estimated using pcac , in practice there are inconsistencies with the values needed phenomenologically @xcite . on the other hand , as it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite , that treatment of the vacuum tensor susceptibility is subtle and different treatments can lead to very different results for the tensor charge .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to calculate these vacuum condensates and vacuum susceptibilities within the framework of coupled flat - bottom potential ( fbp ) model @xcite and global colour model ( gcm ) @xcite .    the global colour model ( gcm ) , a njl - like theory @xcite , has provided a lot of successful descriptions of the long distance properties of strong interaction and the qcd vacuum as well as hadronic phenomena at low energy based on the theoretical foundation that the quark propagator contains valuable information about the nonperturbative properties of qcd @xcite .",
    "the flat - bottom potential is a sum of yukawa potentials , which not only satisfies gauge invariance , chiral invariance and fully relativistic covariance , but also suppresses the singular point which the yukawa potential has .",
    "it works well in understanding the meson structure , such as electromagnetic form factor , radius , decay constant @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we combine the gcm with the fbp to calculate the quark condensate , @xmath9 , @xmath1 , tensor , pion vacuum susceptibilities in the framework of the rain - bow schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : in section 2 , we brief out line the gcm and in section 3 , introduce the fbp , sd equation ; in section 4 , we calculate the vacuum condensates and vacuum susceptibilities ; in section 5 , conclusion and discussion .",
    "here we brief out line the main skeleton of the gcm . the global colour model , based upon an effective quark - quark interaction which is approximated by the effective flat bottom potential in this article , is defined through a truncation of qcd lagrangian while maintaining all global symmetries .",
    "the generating function for qcd in euclidean space can be written as @xmath10 = \\int { \\cal{d}}\\bar{q } { \\cal{d } } q { \\cal{d } } a \\exp\\left\\{-s + \\int d^4 x ( \\bar{\\eta } q + \\bar{q } \\eta)\\right\\ } \\,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 q + \\frac{1}{4 } g_{\\mu \\nu}^{a } g_{\\mu \\nu}^{a } \\right\\},\\ ] ] and @xmath12 .",

    "this model maintains all global symmetries of qcd and permits a @xmath19 expansion , however local su(3 ) gauge invariance is lost by the truncation .    using the functional integration approach ,",

    "<S> in this article , we calculate the dressed quark propagator with the flat bottom potential in the framework of the rain - bow schwinger - dyson equation , which is determined by mean field approximation of the global colour model lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the dressed quark propagator exhibits a dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon and gives a constituent quark mass about 392 mev , which is close to the value of commonly used constituent quark mass in the chiral quark model . </S>",
    "<S> then based on the dressed quark propagator , we calculate some properties of the vacuum , such as quark condensate , mixed quark condensate @xmath0 , four quark condensate @xmath1 , tensor , @xmath2 vacuum susceptibilities . the numerical results are compatible with the values of other theoretical approaches .    </S>",
