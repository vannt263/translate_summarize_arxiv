    "the thermal emission rate of photons from strongly interacting matter encodes several interesting properties of the radiating medium ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",

    "the size of the interacting fireball is much smaller than the mean - free path of photons .",
    "thus , the latter can probe the hot and dense interior of the medium .",
    "however , the observed photon spectra receive contributions from all reaction stages , _",
    "i.e. _ , primordial @xmath0 collisions , pre - equilibrium , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and hadronic phases , plus final - state decays of short - lived resonances ( these so - called `` direct '' photons exclude decays of long - lived hadrons , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "calculations of direct - photon spectra require good control over both the microscopic emission rates and the space - time evolution of the medium .",
    "the latter not only determines the local emission temperature , but also the collective - flow field which generally imparts a net blue - shift on the radiated photons .",
    "in addition , the azimuthal asymmetry of the thermal photon spectra , @xmath3 , is of interest  @xcite : since the bulk @xmath4 requires several @xmath5 to build up , the observed value for photons helps to further constrain their emission history .",
    "direct - photon spectra in urhics have been extracted in pb - pb(@xmath6 ) collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite , in au - au(@xmath7 ) at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite , and in pb - pb(@xmath8 ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite . at sps ,",
    "various theoretical models could approximately reproduce the measured spectra by adding thermal radiation from an equilibrated expanding fireball to a primordial component estimated from pp data  @xcite .",
    "the thermal yield prevailed over the primordial one up to transverse momenta of @xmath9-@xmath10 .",
    "however , a decomposition into contributions from qgp and hadronic radiation , which would allow for a better characterization of the origin of the signal , remains ambiguous . by subtracting the primordial component from their data , the phenix collaboration extracted the `` excess radiation '' and determined its inverse - slope parameter ( `` effective temperature '' ) in au - au collisions at rhic as @xmath11 .",
    "accounting for the aforementioned blue - shift effect , this result indicates that most of the radiation emanates from matter temperatures @xmath12 , challenging the notion of early qgp radiation  @xcite .",
    "a subsequent first measurement of the direct - photon @xmath4 supports this finding  @xcite : in the regime where thermal radiation is expected to be large , @xmath13 , @xmath14 turns out to be comparable to that of pions , which are only emitted at the end of the fireball evolution , _ i.e. _ , at thermal freezeout , @xmath15 .",
    "the large @xmath3 , also found at lhc  @xcite , thus puts rather stringent constraints on the origin of the excess photons .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we have calculated thermal photon spectra at rhic , differing from existing calculations in mainly two aspects .",
    "first , a more extensive set of hadronic thermal photon rates has been employed  @xcite , which , in particular , includes the contributions from baryons and antibaryons ( known to be important in the dilepton context  @xcite ) .",
    "these rates approximately match complete leading - order ( lo ) qgp rates around the pseudo - critical temperature , @xmath16  @xcite , thus rendering a near continuous emissivity across the transition region .",
    "second , a schematic medium evolution was constructed utilizing a blast - wave type elliptic - fireball model , quantitatively fit to spectra and @xmath4 of bulk hadrons ( @xmath1 , k , p ) at @xmath17 and multistrange hadrons ( e.g. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) at @xmath20 .",
    "the implementation of this `` sequential freezeout '' is phenomenologically motivated  @xcite , and , in particular , leads to a saturation of the bulk - medium @xmath4 close to the transition regime , after about 4-@xmath21 for central and semi - central au - au collisions at rhic . as a result , the direct - photon @xmath4 increased by a factor of @xmath22 over existing calculations , reaching into the error bars of the phenix data .    in the present paper",
    "we expand on and scrutinize these findings by extending the calculations to lhc energy and then employing a previously constructed ideal hydrodynamic bulk - evolution  @xcite to conduct a detailed comparison to the emission characteristics of the fireball .",
    "much like the latter , this hydro evolution has been quantitatively constrained by bulk - hadron spectra and @xmath4 , utilizing the concept of sequential freezeout .",
    "both evolutions will be based on a lattice - qcd equation of state ( eos ) for the qgp , matched to a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) with chemical freezeout .",
    "the comparisons will encompass the time evolution of radial and elliptic flow , temperature , four volume and photon emission profile .",
    "motivated by these comparisons , which identify the transition region as a key contributor to thermal photon spectra , we conjecture an enhancement of the currently available photon emission rates around @xmath23 and explore in how far this could help to resolve the discrepancies with the data .",

    "to properly interpret the observed photon spectra it is important to understand how the different emission stages contribute to the total . from the rate expression ,",
    "( [ rate ] ) , one sees that the weighting is governed by three ingredients : the ( differential ) four - volume , the thermal weight ( bose factor ) and the em spectral function ( at the photon point ) .",
    "the former two are governed by the bulk - medium evolution . to make a closer connection to the underlying matter properties",
    ", we now plot pertinent quantities as a function of temperature , rather than time .",

    "this quantity shows a distinct maximum structure around the pseudocritical temperature of @xmath70 , as a consequence of the rapid change in the entropy density in the eos ( a remnant of the latent heat ) .",
    "one also finds a pronounced increase in the differential four - volume in the late(r ) hadronic stages of the collision ( stipulating the importance of a realistic hadronic photon emission rate ) .",
    "again we find that the ideal hydro evolution seems to cool somewhat faster than the fireball ( this might slightly change in a viscous evolution where some of the expansion work is dissipated into heat ) .",
    "whereas hadron emission at kinetic freezeout in the hydro evolution is a continuous process , the fireball freezeout of the entire three - volume occurs at the end of the evolution .",
    "this difference is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_entro ] , where we plot the _ time _ dependence of the fraction of the total entropy that is above the kinetic - freezeout temperature in the hydro evolution .",
    "this fraction shows a marked departure from one at times already well before the total lifetime ; in contrast , this fraction is equal to one throughout the fireball evolution .",
    "recall , however , that the three - volume at small temperatures must be very similar in both evolutions , since the total three - volume at freeze - out figures into the calculation of hadron multiplicities ( and spectra ) , which agree rather well . our hydro evolution ,",
    "on the other hand , does not allow for the possibility that the freeze - out front `` re - swallows '' previously frozen - out matter cells .",

    "the increase in emission four - volume is counteracted by the drop in temperature , suppressing the thermal distribution function in the rate .",
    "this renders the energy argument in the bose function as an important scale .",

    "[ fig_v4-spec ] ) ; in other words , we use the full rate expression - the same for both evolution models - figuring in our comparisons to data in the following sections ( recall that the amy qgp rates ( full lo result )  @xcite and the trg hadronic rates  @xcite are nearly degenerate around @xmath72 , thus avoiding a `` bias '' for either phase ) . for low photon momenta ( energies ) ,",
    "@xmath73 , the `` phase transition '' peak observed in the four - volume is remarkably enhanced , but also the high - temperature part now exhibits significant emission strength .",
    "as expected , the high - temperature component increases further at larger momentum ( @xmath74 ) , albeit not dramatically .",
    "a pronounced peak around @xmath72 persists also for these kinematics .",
    "this analysis clearly identifies the importance of the `` pseudo - critical '' regime , around @xmath72 , for thermal photon radiation , as found in ref .",
    "the macrophysics encoded in the underlying eos plays an important role through a rapid change in entropy density over a rather small temperature window , possibly augmented by a reduction in the velocity of sound , @xmath75 , figuring into the hydro evolution ( a pertinent slowing down has not been implemented into the fireball evolution ) .",
    "an equally important role is plaid by the microphysics , _",
    "i.e. _ , relatively large hadronic emission rates , comparable to the qgp ones , in the transition region . together with substantial flow - induced blue shifts , this led to generating a sizable photon @xmath4 in our previous fireball calculations  @xcite .",
    "these features can be recovered within hydrodynamic evolutions , _ if _ the collective flow is built up sufficiently fast , which can be realized via a modest initial radial - flow field and a compact initial - density profile .",
    "however , quantitative differences remain , which we further analyze in the following two sections by comparing the photon spectra from both approaches with each other and to direct photon data at rhic and lhc .",
    "all thermal photon spectra presented in this section are based on the same emission rates , from a complete lo calculation in a perturbative qgp  @xcite and hadronic many - body calculations supplemented with @xmath31-channel meson exchange reactions  @xcite as well as @xmath76 and @xmath77 bremsstrahlung  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , these final - state decays would have to be calculated with slightly modified kinematics compared to thermal processes ( with an extra lorentz-@xmath80 factor ) , but we neglect this difference in the present study .",
    "ultimately , their contribution to the total direct-@xmath80 @xmath4 turns out to be rather modest ( e.g. , increasing it by typically 5 - 10% around @xmath81gev ) , and even less for the spectra .",

    "while the total ( integrated ) photon yield is not changed much ( analogous to what has been found for low - mass dileptons  @xcite ) , the high-@xmath84 part of the spectrum benefits from the increased temperature in the qgp close to @xmath72 and from the later chemical freezeout in the hadronic phase , which slows down the drop in temperature that arises in the presence of pion ( and other effective ) chemical potentials ( for the inclusive yields , and at low @xmath84 , the faster temperature drop is ( over- ) compensated by the fugacity factors ) .    )",

    "[ fig_t - eps ] ) , which leads to a reduction especially in the high-@xmath84 region of the hadronic emission .",
    "consequently , the hydro spectra and @xmath4 come out lower than for the fireball evolution ; this increases the discrepancy with the phenix data for both observables , although not by much .",
    "both evolution models result in an underestimate of the first two data points of the phenix spectra , and barely reach into the lower portions of the error bars of the @xmath4 data : the maximal @xmath4 reaches @xmath96 for the hydrodynamic evolution , compared to @xmath97 for the fireball , both when using the phenix pp baseline spectra ( larger for the @xmath85 scaling ansatz ) . however , our hydro results are well above other hydrodynamic calculations reported in the literature  @xcite .",

    "lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_t - eps ] ) . as mentioned above , this feature is essential in describing the spectra and @xmath4 of multistrange hadrons with an early kinetic freezeout close to the chemical freezeout temperature , and thus rather well motivated by hadron phenomenology ( including the constituent - quark number scaling of @xmath4 ) . in the hydrodynamic modeling",
    "this can be realized by initial conditions including a finite transverse flow at thermalization , together with a compact energy - density profile .",
    "both features increase the transverse flow early on , which ultimately leads to an earlier saturation of @xmath4 ( since the initial spatial anisotropy is converted faster into momentum space ) ; it also increases the blue shift of the photons emitted from around @xmath72 , which helps to build up the photon yield with large @xmath4 in the @xmath81-@xmath98 region .",
    "another difference to existing hydro calculations is the larger rate in the hadronic phase , in particular the contributions associated with the photon point of the in - medium @xmath99 spectral function , which includes sources from interactions involving baryons and antibaryons  @xcite and higher excited meson resonances  @xcite .",

    "the result of this exercise is shown in fig .",

    "finally , we conduct a schematic study of the effect of quark undersaturation in the early ( q)gp phases , as expected from gluon saturation models  @xcite .",
    "similar to earlier calculations for thermal em emission  @xcite , we find the gluon compton process , @xmath117 , to still contribute appreciably ( and with a harder slope than in a chemically equilibrated qgp at the same total entropy ) , unless the @xmath118 undersaturation is strong enough to largely suppress the early thermal yield altogether .",
    "this suppression would have to be made up by an even larger enhancement in the later phases compared to what we assumed above .",
    "in this paper we have studied the properties of thermal photon radiation at collider energies , in an attempt to better understand recent measurements of direct photon spectra and their elliptic flow . using qgp and hadronic thermal emission rates as available from the literature , we first focused on a detailed comparison of the space - time evolution as given by a blast - wave type fireball and ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "both were based on the same equation of state and fits to the same set of hadron data using the concept of sequential freeze - out for multistrange and light hadrons .",
    "the relevance of this concept for photon radiation lies in a rather early saturation of @xmath4 and larger blue shifts by the time the expanding system reaches the phase transition region ( in the hydro model , this can be realized by compact initial conditions with non - zero radial flow ) .",
    "we have found that the emission characteristics of the qgp part agree rather well between hydro and fireball , while the latter leads to significantly larger photon radiation in the hadronic phase , especially toward higher @xmath84 .",
    "we traced this back to a slower cooling with larger average temperatures and radial flow in the fireball , which , at least in part , is due to a continuous freezeout in hydrodynamics leading to an appreciable reduction of the `` active '' matter cells in the later stages of the evolution .",
    "both evolution models clearly identify the transition region around @xmath119 as a key source of thermal photon emission .",
    "after the addition of primordial photons extrapolated from pp collisions , both hydro and fireball results tend to be somewhat ( although not dramatically ) below the measured spectra and @xmath4 in au - au and pb - pb collisions at rhic and lhc , with a preference for the fireball due to its larger hadronic contribution .",
    "we then shifted our focus to the microscopic emission rates .",
    "we argued that an enhancement of the currently employed emission rates is plausible , especially in the pseudo - critical region where the medium is expected to be most strongly coupled . upon amplifying our default rates by a baseline factor of 2 , reaching up to 3 around @xmath120",
    ", we found that the photon results from the hydro model come rather close to the experimental spectra and @xmath4 within current uncertainties .",
    "the additional hadronic contributions suggested by the fireball model would further improve the situation .",
