    "the closest starburst region , 30  doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , allows one to study the star formation ( sf ) process on a variety of scales , from the dense cluster r  136 , possibly a newborn globular cluster , via the massive star - forming region ngc  2070 , the `` old '' ( 20 to 25 myr , @xcite ) populous cluster hodge  301 , to the many diffuse star - forming regions like ngc  2060 .",
    "deciphering the history of 30  doradus is therefore a unique opportunity to understand how star formation originates and propagates . in previous work @xcite we studied ngc  2070 , a giant region already active 7 myr ago and possibly up to 20 myr ago .",
    "here we analyse hodge 301 ( @xmath6 ) , one of the oldest structures in 30  doradus , approximately located at 3 arc - minutes ( @xmath7 pc , assuming a distance of 50 kpc ) to the northwest of r  136 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hodge  301 ( hereinafter h301 ) was previously studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( hereinafter wb97 ) and @xcite ( hereinafter gc00 ) , among others . as a part of an extensive optical spectral classification effort of the stellar populations within the 30  doradus nebula , wb97 classified h301 as a cluster in the _ h _ and @xmath8 persei phase ( namely containing a- and m - type supergiants ) , with an age @xmath9 myr , the oldest in the 30  doradus complex .",
    "gc00 used a synergy between spectroscopy , ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) photometry and deep wfpc2/hst photometry reaching v@xmath10 to study age , initial mass function ( imf ) , and reddening of h301 . by comparing the loci of main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) and post - ms stars with padova and geneva stellar models , they derived an age of 20 - 25 myr . concerning the imf , for the mass range 1.26@xmath210@xmath11m@xmath1 they derived a slope close to salpeter .",
    "finally , using the uit photometry they found a mean reddening e(b@xmath2v)=@xmath12 .",
    "more recently , using spectroscopy and a qualitative comparison with the evolutionary models of @xcite , @xcite found an age of 15@xmath135 myr .",

    "this stellar feature is used to measure the cluster age in a way that is independent of the previous analysis , mostly based on the msto and post - ms stars . for this task",
    "we used the synthetic cmd approach which allows us to fit several crucial features of the cmd ( msto , pms ton and field contamination ) simultaneously . the advantage with respect to the classical isochrone",

    "the survey http has gathered unprecedented photometric data with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) over the entire tarantula nebula in the near uv ( wfc3/uvis f275w and f336w ) , optical ( acs / wfc f555w and f658n ) , and near ir ( wfc3/ir f110w and f160w ) . here",

    "the elongated shape of the field rc ( visible in the cmd as the over - density around f555w@xmath26 and color around 1.2@xmath21.4 ) suggests the presence of some differential reddening .",
    "the presence of two blue stars above the msto around v@xmath2214 - 15 magnitudes reflects the well - known problem that while theoretical cmds predict a post main sequence gap ( pmsg ) between the end of the main sequence and the presumed core he burning a - supergiants ( the two stars near v@xmath2213 magnitudes ) , this gap is not observed . in clusters of this approximate age the pmsg is populated by bright b - type giants and supergiants ( of similar color to the main sequence dwarfs and sub - giants ) , in the case of hodge 301 these two stars are confirmed cluster members with spectral types b3ib and b2ii - iii(n)e ( see @xcite ) . while the fact that the precursor of sn1987a was a b3i star ( @xcite ) indicates that core he burning stars can inhabit this part of the cmd",

    "a mandatory ingredient of this approach is to accurately test photometric errors and incompleteness of the data . here",
    "these tests are conducted following a two step procedure : 1 ) `` fake '' sources are injected ( one at a time ) following a uniform distribution onto the actual images .",
    "the source detection routine used for our science images is applied to the fields containing the combined actual images and the fake sources . counting how many fake stars are lost as a function of magnitude and position provides the map of the local incompleteness . note",
    "that if the latter is averaged over the entire cluster , the result does not represent the `` true '' average incompleteness , because the distribution of real stars is not uniform ; 2 ) the local incompleteness is used to restore the real profile of the cluster ( before the incompleteness ) .",
    "fake stars are now injected ( one at a time ) onto the actual images following this profile and the source detection routine is applied again . although the resulting incompleteness is locally identical to the incompleteness of step 1 , its average over the entire cluster is an unbiased estimate of the `` true '' average incompleteness .",
    "figure [ perc ] shows the average completeness level for the filters f555w and f775w .",
    "synthetic cmds are generated using the latest parsec ( @xcite ) isochrones , and assuming a kroupa imf and metallicity z=0.008 ( from the mean [ fe / h ] for lmc cepheids of @xcite , referred to the updated @xcite mixture ) .",
    "30% of synthetic stars are considered members of binary systems and their flux is combined with a secondary star sampled from the same imf . to mimic the observational process , each synthetic cmd",

    "the synthetic bl of the 15 myr isochrone fits the magnitude of the two bsgs ( although it is too blue ) , but it is clearly too bright on the red side . on the other hand ,",
    "the 20 myr isochrone fits well the magnitude of the three rsgs , but it fails to reproduce the ratio rsgs / bsgs ( the bl color extension is too short and its morphology resembles a red clump ) ; 2 ) concerning the msto , even considering photometric errors , none of the models is able to reproduce the observed color spread in the magnitude range @xmath35 .",
    "this is not surprising given the presence of be stars , which are thought to be fast rotators surrounded by an out - flowing equatorial disk , likely causing their infrared excess ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; 3 ) only isochrones between 25 myr and 30 myr allow one to reproduce the msto luminosity ( v@xmath36 ; corresponding to a mass @xmath37m@xmath1 with parsec models ) , while the younger ones are at least 1 mag brighter than the msto tip .",
    "_ low mass stars : _ the pms ton is the point where the pms joins the ms . in h301",
    "this phase is populated by low - mass stars below @xmath38m@xmath1 . according to stellar evolution theory , at the magnitude of the ton ,",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of a simple population is characterized by a strong peak followed by a dip ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior is clearly visible in the top panel of fig .",

    "the older the age of the cluster , the fainter the lf ton peak and the corresponding dip .",
    "peak and dip respectively reflect the steep dependence of stellar mass on magnitude near the ton and the following flattening below the ton , caused by the short evolutionary timescale of the pms phase compared to the ms . after the dip ,",
    "the shape of the lf mimics the imf , rising with decreasing stellar mass . for comparison",
    ", the dashed line shows a synthetic zero age ms where the pms phase has been artificially suppressed : as expected , without pms there is no ton peak / dip and lf increases monotonically .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the dependence of ton luminosity on the pms evolutionary times is a serious issue . however , while in the first few myr , pms times are affected by several uncertainties like , e.g. , the initial conditions ( in particular the initial radius ) , the efficiency of convection , the initial abundance of deuterium and the accretion rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , at later times pms tracks tend to converge .",
    "indeed , the zero age ms position for 1 m@xmath1 does not show significant differences among different authors ( see fig . 14 in @xcite ) , with a dispersion in @xmath39 of @xmath40 dex . in terms of age",
    ", such an uncertainty corresponds to an age error smaller than 3 myr at 30 myr .    concerning the observational errors , two things limit the ton visibility in h301 : incompleteness and field contamination . for ages older than 15 myr , at the distance of the lmc",
    ", a ton is fainter than 23 in v magnitude , @xmath41 at 30 myr . at these levels of faintness",
    ", incompleteness can be severe , especially in the center of h301 . at odds with the massive stars , where the degree of contamination is negligible , at faint magnitudes it can bias the age , mimicking an older population .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ lf_annuli ] shows the observed lfs , corrected for the incompleteness , of stars in five concentric annuli of equal area around the center of h301 ( in red , blue , magenta , green and black stars between 0 and 2.91 pc , 2.91 and 4.11 pc , 4.11 and 5.04 pc , 5.04 and 5.82 pc , 5.82 and 6.51 pc , respectively ) .",
    "the hatched area fainter than v=25.25 indicates where the incompleteness in the innermost annulus drops below 50% .",
    "the ton feature is visible as the narrow peak near v @xmath42 in the lf of the innermost region ( red histogram ) . at fainter magnitudes",
    "the lf increases following the imf , then it drops again at v@xmath43 .",
    "this is because below this limit the lf becomes increasingly affected by photometric blends , whose net effect is to brighten the sample and deplete the faint end .",
    "this happens for all annuli , but increases at progressively fainter magnitudes as the distance from the cluster center decreases .",
    "indeed , the blue and magenta lfs ( second and third innermost annuli , respectively ) show a general increase up to v=26 , reflecting the much more favorable incompleteness ( below 50% only at v@xmath44 ) .",
    "however , the higher field contamination reduces the ton visibility , which is only noticeable as a broad peak in the magnitude range @xmath45    finally , the green and black lfs ( the outermost annuli ) show a smooth increase , with no bumps in the range 24@xmath225 , as expected for the average field of the lmc .        from a comparison by eye with the synthetic lfs we estimate the ton age to be between 26 and 30 myr .    in the next section",
    "we derive the most likely sfh compatible with the data .",
    "to recover the most likely sfh we used the hybrid - genetic code sfera ( star formation evolution recovery algorithm ) , the statistical approach described by @xcite .",
    "metallicity , binary fraction and distance modulus are initially kept fixed at z@xmath46 , 30% and 18.5 , respectively , while age , reddening and field contamination are free parameters .",
    "the sfh is parameterized in 40 contiguous steps of duration 1 myr between now and 40 myr ago . the best combination of synthetic cmds and field contamination ( a template field is taken at radii larger than 6 pc from the center ) is searched by sfera . in sfera , observational and model",
    "cmds are binned in color and magnitude , and the binning scheme is changed randomly .",
    "the two 2d distributions are then compared with a poissonian @xmath47 .    in order to reduce as much as possible the field contamination we only used stars within 4 pc from h301 s center . as a first step",
    ", we recovered the sfh using massive stars ( msto ) and low - mass stars ( ton stars ) independently .",
    "the former includes all stars brighter than f555w@xmath48 , the latter all stars fainter than f555w@xmath49 .",
    "figure [ sfh ] shows the results , with the msto / bl solution ( given the paucity of bl stars , the age is largely driven by the msto ) in dashed green and pms ton one in solid blue .",
    "finally , the red solid line shows the sfh inferred using the entire cmd .        in all cases the most relevant peak",
    "is located in the range @xmath50-@xmath51 myr .",
    "the msto / bl solution shows a clear peak at @xmath52 myr , while the ton peak is slightly broader on the young side , suggesting that the msto age is better defined ( not surprising given the much smaller photometric error affecting this phase ) .",
    "the net result is that , within the errors , msto and ton ages are in excellent agreement .",
    "combining the two features leads to the red solid line solution , which resembles more the msto solution , but with smaller uncertainties .",
    "hereafter we refer to this solution as the best sfh for h301 .    at first glance",
    "our conclusions seem at odds with the results derived by @xcite , who studied the age for a selection of clusters and associations younger than 100 myr .",
    "they found that the ages based on pms isochrones are 1.5 - 2.0 times shorter than the `` nuclear '' msto ages .",
    "however , our pms age is mostly based on the ton luminosity , and not on the pms stars , whose color is affected by several uncertainties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another possible source of error is the use of different sets of models to study different phases : we do not have this kind of problem because in this work we used the parsec models which follow the entire evolution from the pms to the post - ms .    fig . [ lf2 ]",
    "shows the synthetic lf ( blue line ) corresponding to the best sfh compared with the observed counterpart ( red line ) .",
    "error bars in the data are the square root of the counts , while the @xmath53 uncertainty in the model is indicated with a blue band .",
    "the quality of the fit is excellent and most of the differences are within the errors .",
    "we found a best - fitting e(b@xmath2v ) of 0.22 - 0.24 mag with a @xmath53 dispersion of 0.04 mag . in this case",
    "the dispersion is not the actual error , but the spread ( differential reddening ) needed to match the ms width .",
    "it is worth to notice that the inferred absolute ages are expected to change according to the adopted distance modulus . indeed",
    "a shorter distance would increase the cluster age .",
    "however , in the range 20 - 30 myr , both the msto and ton magnitudes change with age by @xmath54 , hence the relative age msto / ton remains unchanged .    in order to derive the initial total mass and number of supernovae type ii exploded in h301 we ran 1000 monte carlo simulations normalized to the observed number of stars ( decontaminated with an external field ) brighter than f555w @xmath55 . adopting the peak age @xmath56 myr , we calculated that the initial total mass of h301 was @xmath0 m@xmath1 and that @xmath57 supernovae type ii produce black holes . ] exploded .",
    "this result is also supported by observations ( see gc00 and references therein ; @xcite ) , that place h301 within an high - velocity expanding shell , caracterized by multiple centers and filled with diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "moreover , @xcite classified an object , wb9 ( be1 in gc00 ; indicated with a green circle in fig .",
    "[ chart ] ) , as a spectroscopic binary with a compact companion , possibly the stellar remnant of a supernova event .    before closing this section ,",
    "it is important to discuss the impact of the assumed binary recipe and metallicity on the recovered sfh .",
    "although our findings do not critically depend on the adopted binary fraction and mass ratio , a very high binary fraction ( above 50% ; @xcite ) and flatter mass ratio q ( our binary prescription favors low q binaries ) , as found for o - stars , can affect the recovered sfh . in practice ,",
    "the effect of equal mass binaries is to make stars appear 0.75 mag brighter , and not taking it into account leads to an underestimate of the age . since our sfhs",
    "are derived disfavouring q=1 massive binaries we may indeed interpret the observed brightnesses underestimating the age if the binaries have mostly the same mass .",
    "however , b - type stars may behave differently .",
    "@xcite studied the multiplicity of 408 b - type stars observed in different regions ( ngc  2070 , ngc  2060 , hodge  301 , sl  639 ) of 30  doradus with multi - epoch spectroscopy from the vlt - flames tarantula survey ( vfts ) .",
    "although they found an average binary fraction of about 58% , close to the o - stars multiplicity by @xcite ,",
    "the intrinsic binary fraction in h301 was found to be remarkably low and around 20% ( 8% detected , with a detection probability of @xmath58% ) .",
    "concerning the mass ratio , they found a distribution of q favoring low - mass companions ( f(q)@xmath59 ) .",
    "although our binary prescription is consistent with @xcite s @xcite finding , we also tested the hypothesis of a binary population similar to that found by @xcite for o - type stars .",
    "figure [ bin ] shows the sfh recovered assuming a binary fraction of 50% and a uniform distribution of q. overall , the result is qualitatively similar to the standard sfh , except the peak that is slightly broader .",
    "finally , in the literature there is no evidence of a universal mass ratio holding from massive to low - mass stars ( seey e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the similarity of our inferred msto and ton ages suggests that binary populations of high and low - mass stars are not dramatically different .",
    "the empirical evidence of a metallicity spread in the young populations of the lmc ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) makes hodge s metallicity inherently uncertain . in order to test",
    "the impact of a lower metallicity on the final age , we re - recovered the sfh using parsec models with z=0.005 ( about @xmath53 away from the mean value of luck s sample ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sfr_feh ] .",
    "the lower metallicity reduces the peak age by about 3 myr . in this case ,",
    "the best age is @xmath60 myr .",
    "this difference can be explained by the dependence of msto and ton luminosities on metallicity and helium abundance ( parsec isochrones at z=0.005 have slightly lower helium abundance than isochrones at z=0.008 ) .",
    "first , the lower the metallicity , the shorter the evolutionary timescale of a star of a given mass during the major evolutionary phases . for this reason , at a fixed age , msto and ton masses are lower at z=0.005 than at z=0.008 , and stars of lower masses are also fainter . however , as secondary effect , a decrease of metallicity shifts the isochrone to higher luminosities , whereas a decrease of helium has the opposite effect .",
    "the combined effect of these changes decreases msto and ton luminosities of 0.1 - 0.2 mag , mimicking an older isochrone .",
    "the resulting mean reddening is also higher by about 0.02 mag ( e(b - v)=0.24 mag ) , which causes a further luminosity decrease of about 0.1 mag .",
    "the new peak age , 27.5 myr , leaves the initial total mass of h301 almost unchanged , whereas the number of supernovae type ii , @xmath61 , is slightly lower than in the z=0.008 case .",
    "another effect of the lower metallicity is to increase the luminosity of the bl phase .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ 4cmd_fe05 ] .",
    "in contrast to z=0.008 isochrones ( see fig . [ 4cmd ] ) , the 20 myr bl is long enough to reach the color of the two bsgs , but the red side is now brighter than the three rsgs . on the other hand , the 25 myr isochrone plays the same role of the 20 myr isochrone at z=0.008 , fitting well the rsgs luminosity but failing to reproduce the observed ratio rsgs / bsgs .",
    "the entire 30 myr bl is too faint . in conclusion , while no one model is able to reproduce extension and luminosity of the bl at the same time , the 25 myr is the one that better represents the observed bl , getting closer to the msto / ton best ages , which are now only 2.5 myr apart .    , but the synthetic cmds are computed for z=0.005 instead of z=0.008.,width=377 ]    in summary , given the uncertainty in the metallicity of h301 , we conclude that the best fitting age is between 26.5 and 31.5 myr , while the predicted number of supernovae type ii is between 38 and 61 .",
    "compared to the literature , our lower limit on the age of h301 , @xmath62 myr , is slightly older than the photometric estimate of gc00 , who found @xmath63 and @xmath64 myr using geneva ( @xcite ) and padova models ( @xcite ) respectively .",
    "gc00 required their isochrone fit to match the position of the blue and red supergiants and omitted stars with h@xmath17 excess .",
    "this difference is probably caused by the different versions of the isochrones and different stellar phases used in our analysis .",
    "indeed , if we limit our analysis to the bl phase only ( see fig .",
    "[ 4cmd ] and [ 4cmd_fe05 ] ) , our best estimate of the age would drop down to 20 - 25 myr , in good agreement with gc00 .",
    "gc00 s estimate of the total reddening ( e(b - v)@xmath65 mag ) is compatible with our estimate .",
    "concerning the mass of h301 , gc00 found a present day mass of 4882@xmath13247 m@xmath66 between 0.4 and 12 m@xmath66 , corresponding to an initial mass of @xmath67 m@xmath1 when extrapolated with a salpeter imf above 12 and up to 120 m@xmath1 .",
    "most of the difference from our estimate stems from the different age and imf .",
    "if we were to adopt a salpeter imf in our models down to 0.4 m@xmath1 , our mass estimate would drop to @xmath68 m@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , if we were to adopt a 20 myr isochrone ( as adopted by gc00 ) instead of a 30.5 myr ago , our result would drop to @xmath69 m@xmath1 , in excellent agreement with gc00 s estimate .",
    "our estimated number of supernovae , between 38 and 61 , is in good agreement with gc00 s rate ( @xmath70 ) .    our best age is higher than that found by evans ( 15@xmath135 myr ) , who used high resolution spectroscopy to reconstruct temperature and luminosity for a sample of b - stars within 4.9 pc from h301 s center .",
    "part of the discrepancy can be ascribed to the adopted stellar models from @xcite , whose timing is faster than our padova models of the same metallicity : we found that a padova isochrone of 30 myr has the same msto luminosity of brott et al .",
    "isochrone of 25 myr .",
    "the rest of the discrepancy might then be attributed to two other potential effects ; the choice msto magnitude in the present paper ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] and see the accompanying discussion in section 2 ) , and the transformation from a cmd to the hrd in evans et al .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "5 of evans et al . that they include the fainter of the two pmsg stars in their main sequence group , and from our fig.6 one might argue that raising the msto to v@xmath71 would give an age of  20 myr , in better agreement with evans et al .",
    "however a more serious issue perhaps is that evans et al .",
    "derive luminosities from the stars effective temperatures that imply there are several stars in h301 with masses between 12 and 15 solar masses , significantly in excess of the 9 - 10 m@xmath1 implied by an age of 26.5 - 31.5 myr of the parsec models .",
    "the brightest of these b - stars , particularly those in the pmsg , might be explained as blue stragglers , being the products of binary evolution .",
    "the present low fraction of binaries in h301 , discussed in the previous section , may simply reflect that many of these have already interacted and formed binary products as discussed by @xcite producing blue straggler stars that are among the brightest blue stars in h301 .",
    "finally , it is important to remark that a 15 myr age would be strongly ruled out by the pms ton . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lf_annuli ] , a ton of 15 myr ( grey slope ) would be at least 1 mag brighter than the present ton , and hence less affected by photometric errors and incompleteness .",
    "if any significant excess of counts at v@xmath72 were present , it would be clearly detected .",
    "moreover , the 15 myr age is disfavored by the msto too : as shown in fig .",
    "[ 4cmd ] , the isodensity contours of the 15 myr model show a continuity of counts up to the two pmsg stars , while no stars are observed in the magnitude range 15 - 16 .",
    "we further note , that a search for pms stars based on the h@xmath17 excess emission ( e.g. @xcite ) over the whole http area has revealed an overdensity of about 120 pms stars within 4 pc of h301 , with an average age of @xmath73 myr ( de marchi , panagia , sabbi , et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , hence in excellent agreement with our estimate .",
    "although of low significance , a mild activity in the range 6 - 8 myr is also predicted by most of our solutions .",
    "indeed , for v@xmath74 , a few stars up to 0.5 mag redder than the ms are visible at all radii ( see fig . [ field ] ) , hence suggesting that if a more recent episode of star formation took place this did not stem necessarily from h301 but it involved a larger region , as generated in a more diffuse environment or from a dissolved cluster .",
    "an inspection of the h@xmath17 flux reveals that some of these red objects have h@xmath17 excess , but their signal - to - noise ratio is too low ( @xmath75 ) for a firm conclusion .",
    "another possibility is that a few stars in the region suffer from much higher reddening , mimicking a pms population .",
    "from comparison of the observed cmd with simulations based on stellar evolutionary models we derive in a self - consistent way the age distribution and reddening of hodge  301 , a young cluster located in the 30  doradus region . thanks to the photometric capabilities of the http data - set",
    "we have detected the pms ton for the first time .",
    "the peak age we derive from fitting this feature and the msto , between 26.5 and 31.5 myr ( @xmath52 myr using z=0.008 , @xmath60 myr using z=0.005 ) , confirms that hodge  301 is much older than the bulk of the stars in ngc  2070 , the most active region of 30  doradus , but only slightly older than its oldest stars ( @xmath26 myr ; @xcite ) . for a fixed metallicity ,",
    "the resulting age spread , @xmath76 myr , is of the order of the age uncertainty as expected from photometric errors only , hence it is difficult to conclude whether the spread reflects a real prolonged sf .",
    "the inferred pms ton age is consistent with the age derived from the msto and a few myr older than the age derived from fitting the luminosity of the post - ms stars . in particular , while none of the models can reproduce bl extension and luminosity at the same time , fitting the three rsgs leads to an age between 20 and 25 myr . however , post - ms theoretical models for intermediate / massive stars are very uncertain .",
    "as shown in , e.g. , @xcite mass loss and core - convective overshooting can greatly affect the bl color extension . indeed",
    ", models tend to predict a clear separation in the cmd between ms and bl stars , while no such gap is seen in several extragalactic young massive star clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) and dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . given this uncertainty , we are inclined to favor a cluster age that is mainly derived from fitting the msto and pms ton .",
    "more in general , while the absolute age of h301 does depend on the stellar models adopted , the age difference between h301 and ngc2070 ( @xcite ) is robust , since the analysis is done with the same technique , stellar models and clock ( pms ton ) .",
    "finally , it is intriguing that the msto / pms ton age estimate is also older than the spectroscopic age derived by @xcite .",
    "part of the discrepancy could be attributed to the presence of blue stragglers . however , unless h301 hosts an unusual number of these objects , the discrepancy could indicate problems in current stellar evolutionary models of massive stars .",
    "other interesting results are : 1 ) h301 s total stellar mass is @xmath0 m@xmath1 ; 2 ) the total reddening e(b@xmath2v ) is @xmath3 mag , with a dispersion of 0.04 mag ; 3 ) between 38 and 61 supernovae type - ii exploded in the region .",
    "from the point of view of the tarantula nebula , the old age of h301 , several myr older than the nearby and massive ngc  2070 , and its high supernovae activity , along with the fact that not older clusters are visible in the region , could suggest that the onset of h301 sparked the formation of ngc  2070 .",
