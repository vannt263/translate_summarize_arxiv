    "in the recent past , some interest has been shown in applying methods of statistical linguistics and information theory for the analysis of dna sequences , in particular in investigating whether the frequency distribution of nucleotides or sequences of nucleotides follows zipf s law @xcite , and using the shannon entropy to identify the redundancy or the bias of a nucleotides sequence .",
    "let us recall that , at the end of the forties , zipf remarked that , in natural languages and in many other domains , the distribution function follows an inverse power law , which can be described , denoting by rank @xmath10 the most used _ word _",
    ", by @xmath11 the next one and so on , and with @xmath12 , by @xmath13 in 1992 , it was shown @xcite that the distribution of the nucleotides in dna follows a zipf law of the type given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "however , the opinions on this statement are divided , see @xcite .",
    "soon after @xcite , it was shown that noncoding sequences of dna are more similar to natural languages than the coding ones , and the shannon entropy has been used to quantify the _ redundancy _ of word .",
    "this work also raised a debate in the literature @xcite . also , zipf s law seems well adapted to represent the abundance of expressed genes , with an exponent @xmath14 , as can be seen in the recent work of ref .",
    "the origin of zipf s law is thought to arise from stochastic processes @xcite , especially when they can be modelled as random walks in log scale @xcite ; for further analysis , see @xcite . however , an analysis of the rank distribution for codons , performed in many genes for several biological species , led the authors of @xcite to fit experimental data with an exponential function . in particular , by considering separately different coding dna sequences",
    ", they studied the relation between the parameter in the exponential , the frequency of the rank one and the length of the sequence for different genes .",
    "from this very short overview , it follows that the determination of the kind of law the codon rank distribution follows is extremely interesting , in investigations of the nature of the evolutionary process , which has acted upon the codon distribution , i.e. the eventual presence of a bias .    in the last few years",
    ", the number of available data for coding sequences has considerably increased , but apparently no analysis using the whole set of data has been performed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform such a study . as the result of our investigation ,",
    "we will point out that the rank of codon usage probabilities follows a universal law , the frequency function of the rank-@xmath15 codon showing up as a sum of an exponential part and a linear part .",
    "a quantum - mechanics - inspired model is proposed , which provides for the form of the observed law and gives the correct sign in the different terms .",
    "such a universal behaviour suggests the presence of general biases , one of which is identified with the total _",
    "exonic _ @xmath0 content .",
    "indeed , the values of the parameters appearing in the fitting expression are plotted versus the total percentage of exonic @xmath0 content of the biological species and are reasonably well fitted by a parabola .",
    "finally , from the obtained expression , we derive the theoretical prediction that the usage probability for _ rank - ordered _ codons is the same in any genic region having the same exonic @xmath0 content for any biological species .",
    "we compute the shannon entropy @xcite for amino - acids and find that its behaviour in function of the exonic @xmath0 content is also a parabola , whose apex is around the value 0.50 of the @xmath0 content .",
    "let us define the usage probability for the codon @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of times the codon @xmath16 has been used in the analysed biosynthesis process for a given biological species and @xmath20 is the total number of codons used in all considered processes .",
    "it follows that our analysis and predictions hold for biological species with sufficiently large statistics of codons . for each biological species",
    ", codons are ordered following the decreasing order of the values of their usage probabilities , i.e. codon number 1 corresponds to the highest value , codon number 2 is the next highest , and so on .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the probability @xmath22 of finding @xmath16 is in the @xmath15-th position .",
    "of course the same codon occupies in general two different positions in the rank distribution function for two different species .",
    "we plot @xmath21 versus the rank and we determine that the best fit to the data can be reached by the sum of an exponential function , a linear function in the rank and a constant , i.e. @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are constant depending on the biological species .",
    "these four constants have to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath28    in table [ table : data ] we list the 40 biological species ( 6 vertebrates , 4 plants , 3 invertebrates , 2 fungi and 25 bacteriae )  with a number of codons ranging between 800000 and 20000000 in decreasing order ( data from genbank release 129.0 @xcite ) , whose codon usage has been fitted , specifying for each biological species the value of the parameters , computed by a best - fit procedure and the corresponding @xmath29 . here and in the following , the @xmath30 coefficient is defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the experimental abscissae , @xmath33 the experimental values and @xmath34 the fitted ones . in some cases , @xmath34 takes vanishing or negative values for a few points , hence the @xmath30 is not reported . in figs .",
    "[ fig : homo][fig : esch ] , we report the plot of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath15 for a few biological species ( _ homo sapiens _ , _ drosophila melanogaster _ , _ arabidopsis thaliana _ , and _ escherichia coli _ ) .",
    "the plot has been cut to @xmath35 to take into account the fact that in standard code there are three stop codons ( to end the biosynthesis process ) , whose function is very peculiar .",
    "for the same reason , the @xmath30 has been computed by taking into account the 61 coding codons only . in table",
    "[ table : codons ] , we report the type of the twenty - first most used codons of the observed rank distribution @xmath21 .",
    "a similar study , for a sample of twenty vertebrates with a codon statistics larger than 100000 , reveals that , for almost all biological species , the four most used codons are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "all these codons have a @xmath40 nucleotide in third position and three of them encode doublets . an analysis performed on the chloroplast codon usage for a sample of five plants",
    "gives the same result for the rank distribution @xmath21 , see table [ table : datachl ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chl - arab ] ( _ chloroplast arabidopsis thaliana _ ) .",
    "we also report , in table [ table : datamito ] , the values of the parameters and the @xmath30 for a sample of nine mitochondriae with a codon statistics larger than 15000 .",
    "the fits for _ homo sapiens _ and _ arabidopsis thaliana _ are presented in figs . [",
    "fig : mitohomo ] and [ fig : mitoarab ] .",
    "we point out , however , that for mitochondriae the codon usage frequencies distribution for several species ( e.g. _ arabidopsis thaliana _ or _ drosophila melanogaster _ ) is ill fitted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bf ] ) .",
    "it may be an indication that mitochondriae do not follow the universal law ( [ eq : bf ] ) .",
    "note that the mitochondrial codes have a few differences with the eukaryotic code and vary slightly between species , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in these cases , the @xmath30 has been computed over the corresponding coding codons . the value of the constant @xmath41 is approximately equal to @xmath42 or to @xmath43 , i.e. the value of the codon usage probability in the case of uniform and not biased codon distribution .",
    "therefore the other two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bf ] ) can be viewed as the effect of the bias mechanism .",
    "the appearance of the linear term is more intriguing .",
    "let us remark that in @xcite , where an exponential function is used to fit the rank of usage in genes ( not the rank of usage probability ) , the linear term has not been observed , as its contribution becomes noticeable for approximately @xmath44 .",
    "owing to the analysis of genes ( with at most a few hundred codons ) , the fits in that paper end before this value of the rank .",
    "it is believed that the main causes of codon usage bias are the translational efficiency , the selection pressure and the spontaneous mutations . from the smallness of parameter @xmath45 in ( [ eq : bf ] ) , it is tempting to identify the latter as the consequence of mutation effect and the first term in ( [ eq : bf ] ) as the effect of selection pressure , i.e. the interaction with the environment .",
    "let us try to build up a simple model to explain the universal structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bf ] ) . in a physical quantum system , with discrete energy levels ,",
    "the occupation number of the @xmath46-th energetic level is proportional to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the energy of the level , @xmath49 is identified with the temperature and @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "inspired by this analogy , let us assume that the rank of the probability distribution is a function of some kind of _ energy_. in this case the codon usage probability is , for any codon , equal to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a positive constant .",
    "we assume that the system satisfies periodic conditions in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 directions , with a very small spacing in the @xmath54 direction , so that the excited modes along this direction can be neglected , and that the interaction with the environment can be modelled as the switching on of a constant uniform",
    "_ magnetic field _ in the direction of the @xmath54 axis . as a consequence ,",
    "the landau levels appear , the _",
    "energetic levels _ now being in natural units @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the so - called cyclotron frequency . the wave function is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the wave function of the @xmath15-th energy level of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator shifted by @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "there is a degeneracy due to the arbitrariness of @xmath62 .",
    "a quantun charged physical system in an excited state spontaneously falls down to a lower state , the equilibrium configuration being the system in the fundamental state . in the case of codons ,",
    "the equilibrium condition is the configuration where they occupy different `` energy '' levels , the situation being the analogue of a quantum system in the presence of an external pumping - back source . in order to model this situation in a simple way",
    ", we assume that the equilibrium probability distribution is a function @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the `` spontaneous emission coefficient '' of the @xmath15-th level , which is taken to be very small because of the assumed equilibrium condition .",
    "we can make a first - order development in @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is negative , the occupation probability decreasing with the increasing emission .",
    "we compute @xmath64 in the standard dipole approximation @xcite between the @xmath15-th and the @xmath50-th levels ( @xmath68 ) . in the case of our model , we get @xmath69 so , replacing @xmath70 by the maxwell  boltzmann expression , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : bf ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters depend on the biological species , as the selection pressure ( in the model , the value of the _ charge _ and of the _ magnetic field _ ) is different for different biological species . even if our simple model is able to explain the universal behaviour and the right sign of the linear term",
    ", one should rather consider it as a toy model .",
    "however , the fact that one can build a simple mathematical scenario , able to reproduce the observed distribution , provides us with an indication of the existence of some strong physico - chemical constraints that add to the random effects .",
    "since it is well known that the @xmath0 content plays a strong role in the evolutionary process , we expect the parameters to depend on the total @xmath0 content of the genes region ( here the total exonic @xmath0 content ) , which is indeed correlated with the evolution of the system ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have investigated this dependence and report , in table [ table : alphagc ] , the fits of @xmath71 and @xmath45 to the total exonic @xmath0 content @xmath72 of the biological species .",
    "one finds that the values of @xmath71 and @xmath45 are well fitted by polynomial functions ( with @xmath73 in percentage ) : @xmath74 the two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath45 appear to be correlated . indeed",
    "the plot representing @xmath45 as a function of @xmath71 is satisfactorily fitted by a regression line ( see fig . [",
    "table : entropygc ] ) : @xmath75 the value of the @xmath76 parameter is largely uncorrelated with the total exonic @xmath0 content . let us recall that , however , @xmath76 is a function of @xmath71 and @xmath45 due to the normalization condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nor ] ) .",
    "indeed we have ( assuming @xmath77 ) @xmath78 using the fits for @xmath71 and @xmath45 , we can write the probability distribution function for any biological species , whose total @xmath0 content in per cent in the exonic regions is @xmath72 , as @xmath79 where @xmath76 is obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) . of",
    "course we are not able to predict which codon occupies the @xmath15-th rank .",
    "finally , let us remark that the total exonic @xmath0 content @xmath72 has to satisfy the consistency condition @xmath80 where the sum is over the set @xmath81 of integers to which the 56 codons containing @xmath40 and/or @xmath82 nucleotides belong and @xmath83 is the multiplicity of these nucleotides inside the @xmath46-th codon .",
    "it is natural to wonder if some kind of universality is also present in the rank distribution of amino - acids . from the available data for codon usage",
    ", we can immediately compute ( using the eukaryotic code ) the frequency of appearance of any amino - acid @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) in the whole set of coding sequences .",
    "the calculated values as a function of the rank are satisfactorily fitted by a straight line , @xmath86 the parameters @xmath87 , @xmath88 and the corresponding @xmath30 for the fits are reported in table [ table : amino ] .",
    "a better fit can be obtained in general by using a third - degree polynomial ; however , the range of the four parameters for this fit is larger than the range of the 2-parameter fit . for a few biological species , we give below the parameters for the two fits , see also the figures of table [ table : lincub ] .",
    "the plots of the linear fits for few biological species are given in table [ table : figures ] .",
    "note that the 21st point is just the contribution of the stop codons , which of course has not been taken into account for the fits .",
    "one can remark that the most frequent amino - acid is always above the line .",
    "this can be easily understood in the light of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bf ] )",
    ". indeed , the most frequent amino - acids get , in general , a contribution of the exponential term of ( [ eq : bf ] ) with a low value of @xmath15 ."
