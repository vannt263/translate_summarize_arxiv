    "since the first iron - based layered superconductor la(o@xmath5f@xmath6)feas had been discovered@xcite , the family of iron - based superconductors have brought huge impact in condensed matter physics community . these novel materials exhibit similar phase diagrams compared to high - t@xmath7 cuprates .",
    "the parent compound laofeas has an antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave order @xcite , and , upon doping , superconductivity appears .",
    "although correlation effects are weaker in iron - based superconductors than those in high - t@xmath7 cuprates , novel features arise from the multi - orbital degree of freedom .",
    "the orbital band structures play fundamental roles in determining the fermi surface configurations and pairing structures .",
    "understanding pairing symmetries is one of the most important issues in the study of iron - based superconductors .",
    "based on various experimental @xcite and theoretical works @xcite , the nodeless @xmath2-wave pairing has been proposed . in momentum space ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of many iron - based superconductors consist of hole pockets around the @xmath8-point , and electron pockets around the two @xmath9-points .",
    "the signs of the pairing order parameters on electron and hole fermi surfaces are opposite .",
    "the nodal lines of the gap function have no intersections with fermi surfaces , thus the @xmath2-pairing is nodeless . in the itinerant picture , the fermi surface nesting between the hole and the electron pockets facilitates the antiferromagnetic fluctuations which favor the @xmath2-pairing @xcite . in real space ,",
    "an intuitive picture of the @xmath2-wave pairing is just the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) spin - singlet pairing with the @xmath0-wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "because the anion locations are above or below the centers of the iron - iron plaquettes , the nnn antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath10 is at the same order of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) one @xmath11 .",
    "the nnn @xmath2-wave pairing can be obtained from the decoupling of the @xmath10-term . on the other hand ,",
    "various experimental results have shown signatures of nodal pairing structures @xcite . in the framework of the @xmath0-wave pairing",
    ", the nodal pairing can be achieved through the @xmath1-pairing @xcite .",
    "the possibility for the @xmath1-wave pairing in iron - based superconductors has also been shown in the functional renormalization - group calculation @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of the iron - based superconductors is the spontaneous anisotropy of both the lattice and electronic degrees of freedom , which reduces the 4-fold rotational symmetry to 2-fold .",
    "for example , laofeas undergoes a structural orthorhombic distortion and a long - range spin - density wave ( sdw ) order at the wavevector @xmath12 or @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "similar phenomenon was also detected in ndfeaso by using polarized and unpolarized neutron - diffraction measurements @xcite .",
    "one popular explanation of the nematicity is the coupling between lattice and the stripe - like sdw order @xcite .",
    "the sdw ordering has also been observed in the fete system but with a different ordering wavevector at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "very recently , the experimental results of the fese superconductor reported by song _ et al._@xcite indicate a pronounced nodal pairing structure in the scanning - tunneling - spectroscopy .",
    "strong electronic anisotropy is observed through the quasi - particle interference of the tunneling spectra at much higher energy than the superconducting gap .",
    "the low energy tunneling spectra around the impurity and the vortex core also exhibit the anisotropy .",
    "the shapes of the vortex cores are significantly distorted along one lattice axis .",
    "the anisotropy may arise from the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase at @xmath15k .",
    "however , the typical orthorhombic lattice distortions in iron superconductors are at the order of @xmath16 , which is about half a percent of the lattice constant and only lead to a tiny anisotropy in electronic structures@xcite . in contrast , the anisotropic vortex cores and impurity tunneling spectra observed by song _",
    "are clearly at the order of one .",
    "therefore these anisotropies should be mainly attributed to the electronic origin .",
    "the antiferromagnetic long - range - order in such a system may be a possible reason for the anisotropy . for example , it has been theoretically investigated that the stripe - like sdw order can induce strong anisotropy in the quasi - particle interference of the stm tunnelling spectroscopy @xcite . however",
    ", no evidence of magnetic ordering has been found in fese at ambient pressure @xcite , thus this anisotropy should not be directly related to the long - range magnetic ordering .    on the other hand ,",
    "orbital ordering is another possibility for nematicity in transition metal oxides .",
    "for example , orbital ordering serves as a possible mechanism for the nematic metamagnetic states observed in sr@xmath17ru@xmath18o@xmath19 @xcite , and its detection through quasi - particle interference has been investigated @xcite .",
    "orbital ordering has also been suggested to lift the degeneracy between the @xmath20 and @xmath21-orbitals to explain the anisotropy in iron - based superconductors .    in this article , we will study the effect of orbital ordering to the vortex tunneling spectra in the fese superconductor .",

    "the resonance peak splits into two pieces inside gap .",
    "this feature is similar to the previous studies on the @xmath135-wave pairing with sdw in iron - based superconductor@xcite and the @xmath154-wave pairing with antiferromagnetic ordering in cuprates@xcite .",
    "away from the vortex center , however , the peaks of the particle and hole branches along short ( @xmath50 ) and long ( @xmath51 ) axes behave differently .",
    "the separation between the particle and hole peaks disperses along the short axis much quicker than that along the long axis .",
    "the peak intensities along the short axis are stronger than those along the long axis .",
    "these features are in good agreement with recent experiment observations @xcite .",

    "the nn @xmath158-wave and the nnn @xmath2-wave are considered , which generally are mixed .",
    "when the nnn pairing dominates , nodal pairing still exists even in the appearance of orbital ordering .",
    "we further performed the bdg calculation for the vortex tunneling spectra in the presence of orbital ordering , which breaks @xmath3 rotational symmetry down to @xmath4 and explicitly induces anisotropic vortex structures .",
    "the microscopic mechanism of the origin of this spontaneous anisotropy remains an open question .",
    "it might be related to the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations . as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , before the onset of the antiferromagnetic long rang order , the spin nematic order with a z@xmath18 symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "this nematic order corresponds to anisotropic spin - spin correlation along @xmath52 and @xmath159-axis , which can in turn induce orbital ordering .",
