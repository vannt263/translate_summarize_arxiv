    "cosmic ray particles with energy in excess of @xmath8 have been detected by a number of independent experiments over the last few decades [ @xcite ] .",
    "these include the haverah park [ @xcite ] , fly s eye [ @xcite ] and akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) [ @xcite ] experiments , which together have recorded over a hundred such ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "it has long been recognised that the existence of these uhecrs poses an awkward problem [ @xcite ] . at such high energies ,",
    "the typical range of protons decreases rapidly because of interactions with the cosmic microwave background photons , becoming as low as @xmath9  mpc at the highest observed energy of @xmath10 ev [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is even smaller for nuclei [ @xcite ] .",
    "there is evidence for a change in composition towards protons at the highest energies from the elongation rate of the showers observed by fly s eye [ @xcite ] and its successor hires [ @xcite ] as well as agasa ( when appropriately reanalysed ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "if the uhecrs are nucleons and their sources are distributed homogeneously throughout the universe , this should create a `` gzk cutoff '' in the energy spectrum at @xmath11 [ @xcite ] .",
    "this can be evaded if the uhecrs are neutral particles , e.g. neutrinos or photons . however , neutrinos which interact only weakly have too small a cross - section to initiate the observed airshowers [ @xcite ] . ]",
    "photon - initiated showers would have different characteristics than those observed ; in particular , the highest energy fly s eye event was probably a nucleon [ @xcite ] .",
    "a recent analysis of horizontal showers in the haverah park data sets a bound of 55% on the photon component ( and a bound of 30 % on the iron nuclei content ) of post - gzk uhecrs [ @xcite ] .",
    "so , if cosmic rays with energies @xmath12 are protons , as we assume on the basis of the above evidence [ @xcite ] , then they they must originate within the local supercluster .    there has been a plethora of suggestions as to the possible origin of uhecrs , which may be divided into ` top - down ' and ` bottom - up ' models . in the former class ,",
    "the extreme energies are provided by the decay of relic topological defects or super - massive particles . in the latter class ,",
    "the extreme energies are provided by the acceleration of particles in astrophysiscal sites such as gamma - ray bursts and active galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the observational signatures of one ` top - down ' and one ` bottom - up ' model in some detail .",
    "one ` top - down ' possibility is that the uhecrs may originate from the decay of super - massive relic particles which may constitute ( a fraction of ) the dark matter in galactic haloes [ @xcite ] .",
    "such particles must have a mass @xmath13  gev to account for the highest energy events , with a lifetime exceeding the age of the universe . a well - motivated particle physics candidate with both the required mass and metastability , proposed _ before _",
    "the definitive fly s eye event [ @xcite ] , is the `` crypton ''  the analogue of a hadron in the hidden sector of supersymmetry breaking in string theories [ @xcite ] .",
    "it has been recently noted that such particles can be readily produced with a cosmologically interesting abundance in the time - varying gravitational field at the end of inflation [ @xcite ] .",
    "a key test of this model is the expected small anisotropy caused by the offset of the sun from the centre of the galaxy [ @xcite ] .",
    "it has been claimed that the expected anisotropy is already higher than that observed at lower energies @xmath14 [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , this is beside the point , as such measurements do not constrain the new ` flat ' spectrum component of cosmic rays which extends beyond the gzk cutoff [ @xcite ] .",
    "it has also been claimed that the absence of any excess signature in the direction of the halo of the nearby andromeda galaxy is an `` insuperable '' problem for this model [ @xcite ] .",
    "this claim has already been contested on the grounds that any excess signal would not be detectable in the present sample of @xmath2 events per @xmath15 solid angle [ @xcite ] .",
    "a number of authors [ @xcite-@xcite ] have calculated the expected anisotropy assuming either an isothermal halo profile or the `` universal '' density profile suggested for cold dark matter dominated halos [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , very little is known for certain about the shape , profile and extent of the dark halo of the galaxy , and so it is important to examine more general halo models .",
    "one ` bottom - up ' possibility is that the uhecrs originate in nearby extragalactic sources .",
    "estimates of the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) are typically of @xmath16  gauss [ @xcite ] , which is insufficient to deflect such energetic protons by more than a few degrees .",
    "hence , the uhecrs should point back in the direction of the sources .",
    "nevertheless , searches for sources within @xmath17 of observed events have not had any success [ @xcite ] .",
    "the uhecrs ( particularly in the haverah park sample [ @xcite ] ) show a correlation with the supergalactic plane [ @xcite ] , but this is not seen in the fly s eye [ @xcite ] or agasa [ @xcite ] data .",
    "the latter dataset has the largest number of events and a detailed analysis finds the arrival directions are consistent with isotropy , but with some evidence of clustering on an angular scale of @xmath18 close to the supergalactic plane [ @xcite ] .",
    "various possibilities have been suggested for altering the igmf to enable an origin in nearby radio galaxies or active galactic nuclei , e.g. , m87 or centaurus  a [ @xcite ] , but these have difficulties [ @xcite ] . for uhecrs to originate in nearby extragalactic sources",
    ", they must come from a population that is larger than the nearest active galactic nuclei or radio galaxies .",
    "it is believed that all big galaxies harbour supermassive ( @xmath19 ) black holes and have passed through an active phase in the past , even if they are quiescent today [ @xcite ] .",
    "processes are known that permit efficient energy extraction from supermassive black holes [ @xcite ] , and",
    "so one possibility is that nearby galactic nuclei are the arena of production of uhecrs [ @xcite ] , even though detailed pathways are lacking .",
    "studies have already shown that if the sources of uhecrs trace the density field of nearby galaxies , then the observed flux can possibly be recovered , at least for hard injection spectra [ @xcite ] .",
    "although the energetics of the production of the particles may be problematic , this is nonetheless an interesting model to contrast with the decaying dark matter hypothesis .",
    "it also gives rise to an anisotropy signal in the arrival directions of uhecrs , as the nearby rich clusters ( like virgo and fornax ) make a disproportionately large contribution .",
    "we must keep in mind however that the expected anisotropy may be diluted by a factor of up to @xmath20 by the concomitant isotropic background from even further sources . in practice , given that this dilution is sensitive to the assumed injection spectrum of the sources ( e.g. , it would be negligible for an @xmath21 spectrum [ @xcite ] ) , we do not explicitly take this into account .    in this paper",
    ", we always neglect the effects of magnetic fields on uhecr trajectories .",
    "this is justifiable if the sources lie in the galaxy s halo , as studies suggest that the influence of the galactic magnetic field on trajectories is small if the energies are greater than @xmath22 ev [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is a more controversial assumption if the sources are extragalactic .",
    "if an inhomogenous energy density distribution which follows the lyman-@xmath23 forest distribution is assumed [ @xcite ] , then the estimates of the igmf can be as large as @xmath24  gauss .",
    "it also possible that the igmf has a small filling factor and is structured on large scales of up to tens of mpcs [ @xcite ] .",
    "hence , it is sometimes claimed that a plausible upper limit to the igmf could be as high as @xmath25  gauss , in which case considerable deflection of incoming charged uhecrs is a real possibility [ @xcite ] . however , there are also strong arguments against such high values for the igmf [ @xcite ] . in particular , it is hard to see how such a field can be generated dynamically over tens of mpcs , as the eddy turnaround time is larger than a hubble time .",
    "note that our choice of @xmath22 ev as the threshold is a reasonable compromise , i.e. , it is high enough to minimize magnetic deflection without losing too much flux . in principle",
    ", a lower energy cut may appear attractive for analysing the halo source model , since the propagation distance is less than @xmath26 kpc .",
    "however , to fit the spectrum still requires the new ` flat ' component of cosmic rays ( from dark matter decays in this case ) to remain subdominant below the @xmath27 power - law extension from lower energies until @xmath28 ev [ @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , this cut enables easy comparison with earlier studies of the expected anisotropy [ @xcite ] .",
    "the motivation for the paper is that the prospects for detection of any anisotropy signal in the uhecrs in the next few years are good .",
    "the southern station of the pierre auger observatory [ @xcite ] is already under construction at malarge , argentina and will be complete by 2004 .",
    "the array consists of 1600 water - cerenkov detectors distributed in a grid covering about 3000 square kilometers .",
    "the northern station is planned for utah and will then enable continuous , full - sky coverage .",
    "estimates have already been made of the number of events that auger will detect after five years of operation [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is reckoned that there will be @xmath29 above @xmath30 ev , @xmath31 above @xmath32 ev and @xmath33 above the highest energy fly s eye event ( @xmath34 ev ) .",
    "another experiment that will have a considerable impact is the extreme universe space observatory  [ @xcite ] .",
    "this is scheduled for flight on the international space station starting in mid 2007 .",
    "it will detect flourescent light produced when uhecrs interact with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "given the richness of forthcoming experimental opportunities , it is interesting to examine possible tests .",
    "can we use the anisotropy signal to distinguish between a local origin in the halo of the galaxy and a more distant origin in nearby galaxies ?",
    "if the uhecrs originate in the galaxy s halo , what can be learnt about its structure ?",
    "if the uhecrs emanate from nearby astrophysical sources , what can be learnt about their distribution ?",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the theoretical framework for analysis of the anisotropy signal .",
    "section 3 introduces four halo models , while section 4 constructs four samples of nearby galaxies .",
    "the prospects for distinguishing between the galactic and extragalactic origins of uhecrs with the existing haverah park and agasa experiments and especially the southern station of the auger observatory are examined .",
    "section 5 sums up our conclusions .",
    "the emissivity of uhecr per unit volume is proportional to the number density of sources @xmath35 . the incoming flux of uhecr per unit solid angle @xmath36 as a function of right ascension @xmath23 and declination @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the heliocentric position vector . here ,",
    "@xmath40 marks the extent of the distribution of sources , which may depend on direction .",
    "the measured flux of uhecr is the incoming flux modulated by the response of the detector @xmath41 , which is the relative efficiency of the detection of events with direction .",
    "it depends only on the declination and not on the right ascension , because , if the detector is run with reasonable efficiency , there will be almost uniform exposure in right ascension after a year or so . the response as a function of declination depends partly on the attenuation of showers in the atmosphere , partly on the sensitivity of the detector as a function of zenith angle .    for the scintillator arrays of agasa and",
    "the water - cerenkov detectors used at haverah park , the declination distribution @xmath41 of the observed events is reproduced in figure 1 of uchihori et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "our procedure is to fit third - degree polynomials ( conveniently bounded by step functions ) to these experimental curves . for agasa , this gives @xmath42 valid for @xmath43 . for haverah park",
    ", this gives @xmath44 valid for @xmath45 .",
    "these expressions are normalised to a maximum value of unity .    in the absence of measurements from south auger , we explore two possibilities .",
    "first , following medina tanco & watson [ @xcite ] , we use the declination distribution found at haverah park ( @xmath46 n ) , mirrored and shifted to the latitude of the south auger site at malarge , argentina ( @xmath47 s ) .",
    "the motivation for this is that the peak of the response function usually coincides with the geographic latitude ( at least when there is not continuous exposure at the poles ) .",
    "so , we use : @xmath48 second , following sommers [ @xcite ] , we use the analytic expression valid for a detector at a single site with continuous operation and constant exposure in right ascension .",
    "suppose the detector is at latitude @xmath49 and that it is fully efficient for particles arriving with zenith angles @xmath50 less than some maximum value @xmath51 , which is taken as @xmath52 .",
    "this gives us : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the local hour angle at which the zenith angle becomes equal to @xmath51 .",
    "it is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 note that the two declination distributions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are quite different .",
    "the maximum of @xmath58 is ( generally ) in the direction of the pole , whereas the maximum of @xmath57 is in the direction of the geographic latitude of the south auger site .",
    "often , but not always , our results do not depend too much on the details of the response function .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      to take into account the declinations of the galaxies , we use the discrete analogue - s of equations  ( [ eq : han0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : han ] ) : @xmath59 @xmath60 where the index @xmath61 runs along all the galaxies in the sample and @xmath41 is the response function of each experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig : plotsofgals ] shows the distribution of galaxies in the four samples .",
    "the supergalactic plane is clearly visible , as is the zone of avoidance within @xmath62 of the galactic plane . some of the prominent local features are also readily apparent .",
    "the virgo cluster is centered at @xmath63 , while the fornax cluster is at @xmath64 .",
    "the densest part of the local supercluster and the hydra - centaurus supercluster are prominent at @xmath65 , while the perseus - pisces cluster stretches from @xmath66 .",
    "of course , any optically selected survey is strongly affected by extinction at low galactic latitudes .",
    "we could avoid this bias by using a different catalogue such as the _ iras _ galaxies .",
    "this though merely substitutes one bias for another , as early - type galaxies are under - represented in the _ iras _ survey , whereas late - type dusty disk galaxies are over - represented .",
    "how serious is the bias caused by low latitude extinction on our calculations ?",
    "let us note that the dwingeloo obscured galaxy survey conducted a shallow search in the entire northern zone of avoidance for nearby and/or massive galaxies and this yielded just 5 candidates [ @xcite ] .",
    "they estimated that there are @xmath26 galaxies missing within @xmath67 mpc .",
    "the distance factors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ffone],[eq : fftwo ] ) mean that the nearest galaxies have the largest weight .",
    "hence , this suggests that low latitude obscuration will not have a deleterious effect on our results .",
    "only if there are large numbers of missing galaxies within 10 mpc is our calculation likely to be in error , and this circumstance does not seem to be the case , as judged by the available evidence .    table  [ table : tab6 ] shows the signal expected for agasa and haverah park . for all four samples ,",
    "the size of the amplitude is significant , so that detection of the anisotropy is not enough to implicate decaying dark matter haloes .",
    "samples i and ii , which contain almost all the nearby galaxies , do yield an anisotropic signal of the same order of magnitude as seen by agasa and haverah park .",
    "in fact , the direction of the signal is well within the @xmath68 confidence limits for the haverah park dataset .",
    "the probabilities that the agasa and haverah park datasets are drawn from within the @xmath68 confidence limits of the model are moderate ( @xmath69 ) and high ( @xmath70 ) respectively .",
    "the phase of the anisotropy is robust against changes in the cut - off radius , suggesting that it is the very closest galaxies ( within @xmath71 mpc ) that are contributing most of the signal .",
    "the direction of the signal shows that it is is dominated by nearby structures in the supergalactic plane , especially the virgo cluster .",
    "of all our models , samples iii and iv , which contain the nearby bright galaxies within 50 and 100 mpc respectively , give the largest amplitude for the anisotropy signal .",
    "they are clearly disfavored by the existing agasa and haverah park datasets .",
    "table  [ table : tab6 ] shows there is vanishingly small probability that either dataset is drawn from within the @xmath68 confidence limits of the model .",
    "the observed distribution of uhecrs seems to be more isotropic than expected if they emanate just from the nearby bright galaxies .",
    "table  [ table : tab7 ] shows the potential effects of the auger observatory .",
    "again , auger i has the same amplitude and phase as recorded by agasa , while auger ii is the same as that by haverah park , with the number of events increased to 1000 . of course",
    ", if uhecrs originate in nearby galaxies , then the northern hemisphere signal will be different from the southern hemisphere .",
    "we are simply resizing the experimental box to match auger s sensitivity as an illustration of its ability to discriminate .",
    "tables  [ table : tab7 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are composed mainly of zeros .",
    "the large number of events now enables all four samples to be ruled out , as the signals do not coincide with those measured by agasa and haverah park .",
    "figure  [ fig : harmonicgalaxies ] shows these results pictorially , together with the @xmath68 confidence limits .",
    "the signal seen by south auger is recorded in table  [ table : tab7 ] ( c ) .",
    "the amplitude is greater than that seen by the northern hemisphere detectors , and the phase points in a different direction .",
    "for samples i and ii , we obtain results that depend on the assumed detector response so it is difficult to make definite predictions .",
    "the number of events for a @xmath72 detection in the amplitude is @xmath73 ( for the @xmath74 response ) and @xmath75 ( for the @xmath76 response ) . for samples",
    "iii and iv , we obtain large amplitudes irrespective of the response function .",
    "only @xmath77 events are needed for a @xmath72 detection of the amplitude .",
    "the direction of the phase is largely controlled by the fornax cluster , which is the nearest rich cluster to us .",
    "although it is less massive than the virgo cluster , its effect is dominant in the southern sky .",
    "suppose that we wished to ensure that the @xmath78 ( or @xmath72 ) error bars on the measured phase at south auger are @xmath79 .",
    "this is sufficient to implicate an extragalactic origin of the uhecrs and requires @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) events .",
    "the origin of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is unknown , but the distribution of arrival directions provides important clues .",
    "we have examined two possible hypotheses for the origin in detail . as the available dataset of uhecrs is too small to yield definitive evidence for anisotropy ,",
    "we have concentrated on the prospects for the auger observatory , especially its southern station at malarge , argentina .",
    "first , uhecrs may be produced by the decay of dark matter in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the offset of the sun from the galactic centre causes an anisotropy signal .",
    "the magnitude of this anisotropy is largest for dark halo models which are cusped ( such as the navarro - frenk - white or nfw profile ) .",
    "however , there is overwhelming astronomical evidence that the galactic halo does not have a cusped density profile .",
    "it is more likely that the halo has a core radius @xmath82 kpc , so that dark matter is dynamically unimportant in the central parts but dominates more and more beyond the solar circle .",
    "the halo may be isothermal or triaxial or possibly even tilted with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "if such models describe the distribution of decaying dark matter , then the amplitude of the anisotropy @xmath83 is @xmath84 for the agasa and haverah park detectors , whilst the phase of the anisotropy @xmath85 points towards the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "the shape of the halo controls the phase , whereas the scale of the halo controls the amplitude .",
    "spherical halo models yield anisotropies whose phase coincides with the direction of the galactic centre , whereas triaxial models give angular deviations of @xmath86 depending on the halo shape and detector location .",
    "the amplitude of the anisotropy is controlled by the halo core radius @xmath87 .",
    "this parameter is not easy to determine by astrophysical means .",
    "so , should this mechanism of uhecr production be proved correct ( e.g. , through confirmation of the expected energy spectrum [ @xcite ] ) , then it will provide a direct way of measuring the core radius .",
    "if uhecrs originate in dark haloes , then it has been suggested that the halo of m31 would be visible as a hotspot  [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , the size of this effect seems to be modest .",
    "partly this is because recent analyses have revised the overall mass of the m31 halo downwards , making it roughly comparable to the mass of the galactic halo  [ @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , uhecrs emanating from m31 are deflected by a few degrees and so the effect must be sought in a field size of @xmath88 , which dilutes the signal  [ @xcite ] .",
    "our calculations suggest that only a mild enhancement is expected ( @xmath89 ) and its identification requires considerably more events than in the agasa and haverah park datasets , in agreement with  [ @xcite ] but not with  [ @xcite ] .",
    "note that the south auger detector will not help much in this regard , as m31 is not visible from the latitude of malarge .",
    "a robust prediction of the decaying dark matter hypothesis is that the amplitude of the anisotropy at the south auger station will be larger than at the northern hemisphere sites , simply because the galactic centre lies at southern declinations .",
    "isothermal haloes , whether spherical , triaxial or tilted , yield anisotropies of amplitude @xmath90 for a halo core radius @xmath82 kpc .",
    "typically , the detection of between 150 and 500 events at south auger will be required for a @xmath91 identification of the anisotropy signal . however",
    ", if the core radius is smaller ( @xmath92 kpc ) , then the amplitude of the anisotropy is @xmath93 and perhaps as few as 40 events would suffice",
    ". the phase will give information on triaxiality or tiltedness , and this may be obtained with @xmath94 events for isothermal - like models .",
    "more importantly , @xmath95 events are sufficient to confirm that the phase points in the rough direction of the galactic center , which would implicate a galactic origin of the uhecrs .",
    "a second hypothesis is that the uhecrs may originate in the nuclei of nearby galaxies , perhaps produced by supermassive black holes . if only the nearby bright galaxies are the sources , then the amplitude of the anisotropy is much greater than observed in the agasa and haverah park datasets ( typically @xmath96 ) .",
    "it therefore seems that this hypothesis can already be ruled out , as the probabilities that the agasa and haverah park datasets are consistent with such signals are very small .",
    "however , some caution is needed as the number of uhecrs is still small and the effects of low latitude obscuration have been neglected in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , the expected anisotropy may be diluted by up to a factor of @xmath20 by a possible isotropic background .",
    "if extragalactic sources are to provide the uhecrs , then the population must be larger than just the nearby bright galaxies .",
    "the smallest galaxy presently suspected of possessing a supermassive black hole is m32 .",
    "samples of nearby galaxies brighter than m32 yield an anisotropy signal @xmath97 in amplitude and @xmath98 in phase .",
    "this is in good agreement with the signal seen by haverah park , and in rough agreement with that seen by agasa . in the decaying dark matter hypothesis , the phase always points in the approximate direction of the galactic centre .",
    "if , however , all nearby galaxies provide the uhecrs , then the phase at the agasa and haverah park detectors points towards @xmath99 and is controlled by prominent mass concentrations in the supergalactic plane , such as the virgo cluster ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the measurement of significant anisotropy with the south auger station does not by itself validate the decaying dark matter hypothesis , as this phenomenon occurs in our extragalactic samples as well . when all galaxies intrinsically brighter than m32 are included , the amplitude of the anisotropy is @xmath101 irrespective of whether the cut - off is 50 or 100 mpc .",
    "the number of events for a @xmath72 detection in the amplitude is @xmath102 .",
    "the phase @xmath85 does not point toward the galactic centre , but is controlled by the nearby fornax cluster ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "suppose that we wished to ensure that the @xmath78 error bar on the measured phase at south auger is @xmath104 , which would be strong evidence for an extragalactic origin .",
    "this requires @xmath80 events .    in conclusion",
    ", it seems that one of the most important contributions that the south auger experiment can make is to identify the phase direction in the southern hemisphere .",
    "if uhecrs have a galactic origin , then the phase will point towards the galactic centre .",
    "if uhecrs have an extragalactic origin , then it seems they must be produced by almost all nearby galaxies ( else the signal seen by agasa and haverah park would be much larger ) .",
    "then , the phase of the anisotropy recorded by south auger will lie roughly in the direction of the fornax cluster .",
    "provided the effects of the intergalactic magnetic field can be neglected , this gives an unambiguous discriminant between the two theories and requires only @xmath7 events .",
    "this should be obtained within the first three years of operation of south auger .    * acknowledgments * : we thank motohiko nagano for providing the experimental datasets , as well as paul sommers and alan watson for a number of helpful discussions and clarifications .",

    "<S> ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) may originate from the decay of massive relic particles in the dark halo of the galaxy , or they may be produced in nearby galaxies , for example by supermassive black holes in their nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy in the arrival directions is studied in four dark halo models ( cusped , isothermal , triaxial and tilted ) and in four galaxy samples ( galaxies intrinsically brighter than centaurus  a within @xmath0 and @xmath1 mpc , and galaxies intrinsically brighter than m32 within @xmath0 and @xmath1 mpc ) .    in decaying dark matter models , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the anisotropy is controlled by the size of the galactic halo , while the phase is controlled by the shape . as seen in the northern hemisphere </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude is @xmath2 for cusped haloes , but falls to @xmath3 for isothermal haloes with realistic core radii . </S>",
    "<S> the phase points in the direction of the galactic centre , with deviations of @xmath4 possible for triaxial and tilted haloes . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the halo of m31 is too weak to provide conclusive evidence for the decaying dark matter origin of uhecrs . in extragalactic models , samples of galaxies brighter than centaurus  a produce substantial anisotropies ( @xmath5 ) , much larger than the limits set by the available data . if all galaxies brighter than m32 contribute , then the anisotropy is more modest ( @xmath6 ) and is directed toward mass concentrations in the supergalactic plane , like the virgo cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> predictions are made for the south station ( malarge ) of the pierre auger observatory . if the uhecrs have a galactic origin , then the phase points towards the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> if they have an extragalactic origin , then it points in the rough direction of the fornax cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a robust discriminant between the two theories and requires @xmath7 events at south auger .    </S>",
