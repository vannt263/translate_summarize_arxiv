    "star formation rate ( sfr ) is one of the most fundamental parameters which characterise the nature of galaxies .",
    "deriving sfrs of galaxies is therefore an important task in the extra - galactic astronomy .",
    "there are various indicators proposed for star - formation activity in galaxies , including rest - frame uv continuum light , nebular emission lines ( such as h@xmath2 ) , mid- to far - infrared dust thermal emission , and radio continuum luminosity ( see review by @xcite ; @xcite ) .    when measuring sfrs , dust extinction correction is always an important issue . particularly in the case of star - burst galaxies",
    ", it is possible that only a tiny fraction of uv light can escape from the galaxy because they are heavily obscured by dust .",
    "this leads to an order of magnitude extinction correction for estimating the intrinsic uv luminosity ( hence sfrs ) . for studies of high - redshift galaxies , where the cosmic star formation rate density is an order of magnitude higher than the present - day universe ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are much more common",
    "population ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , and therefore the effect of dust must be carefully taken into account .",
    "far - infrared ( fir ) observations , on the other hand , allow a direct measurement of dust thermal emission , and in particular , observations covering a peak of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies ( usually located at around @xmath8@xmath6100  @xmath9 m ) allow us to derive total ir luminosity ( hence dust - enshrouded sfr ) with reasonable accuracy .",
    "a problem is that such fir observation requires space telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , due to the poor spatial resolution of the ir space telescopes ever launched , the depths of fir observations are always limited by source confusion , making it impossible to detect individual galaxies at high - redshift , except for exceptionally luminous objects .",
    "another important tool for measuring sfr is h@xmath2@xmath106563 line , which is well - calibrated in the local universe .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is emitted in star - forming hii regions ( near short - lived , o - type stars ) , and so the h@xmath2 luminosity is expected to be proportional to on - going sfr .",
    "the h@xmath2 line is located at optical wavelength ( hence less sensitive to dust extinction effects than uv light ) , and therefore h@xmath2 line is recognised as an excellent indicator of sf activity . of course , h@xmath2 line",
    "is also affected by dust . even for local spiral galaxies with moderate levels of star formation , the dust extinction at h@xmath2 is not negligible ( @xmath111 mag : e.g.  @xcite ) . in the case of more active starbursts ,",
    "the h@xmath2 line is reported to be more heavily obscured by dust , and @xmath3 exceeds @xmath63-mag in extreme cases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore ideally required to combine the h@xmath4@xmath12 line flux , with which one can derive dust extinction level using h@xmath2/h@xmath4 ratio ( i.e. balmer decrement ) .",
    "this method needs to assume the shape of extinction curve , as well as the electron density and temperature , but other than that , it allows us to derive dust extinction levels purely based on physics . with recent advents of sensitive nir instruments installed on 8-m class telescopes",
    ", it is becoming easier to obtain h@xmath2 information for high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) galaxies ; e.g.  with spectroscopy and/or narrow - band imaging . however , h@xmath4 line is usually much fainter than h@xmath2 , making it very challenging to apply the balmer decrement method for measuring dust extinction for high-@xmath1 galaxies .",
    "indeed , it is becoming possible to obtain unprecedentedly high - quality nir spectra for high-@xmath1 galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , but even with such high - quality data , it is still challenging to detect h@xmath4 lines from individual galaxies .",
    "our idea is to use observed h@xmath2-to - uv flux ratio to predict dust extinction levels of galaxies . for high - redshift studies , rest - frame uv flux density",
    "can easily be traced by optical photometry .",
    "considering the fact that h@xmath2 is less sensitive to dust extinction than uv continuum light , it is expected that the h@xmath2/uv flux ratio can provide a crude test for dust extinction level ( i.e.  galaxies with higher h@xmath2/uv ratio are expected to be dustier ) .",
    "it is of course true that an intrinsic @xmath14/@xmath15 ratio can change with galactic age , sf history , metallicity , or initial mass function ( imf ) , and therefore it is not straightforward to directly link the h@xmath2/uv ratio to the dust extinction properties ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , as demonstrated by @xcite with a small sample of local star - forming galaxies , the h@xmath2/uv ratio is indeed well correlated with dust extinction properties . in this paper",
    ", we will revisit this issue and attempt to construct an empirical calibration to predict dust extinction with h@xmath2/uv ratio , by compiling a statistical sample of nearby galaxies ( @xmath16 ) drawn from sdss , galex , and akari .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    ", we present our datasets and summarize physical quantities used in the paper .",
    "we use sdss , galex , and akari data to obtain uv- , h@xmath2- , and fir - based sfrs .",
    "our main results are shown in section  3 .",
    "we first present a positive correlation between dust extinction ( @xmath3 ) and h@xmath2/uv flux ratio ( section  3.1 ) , and then we draw the scatter around the @xmath3h@xmath2/uv correlation as functions of stellar mass and/or h@xmath2 equivalent width ( section  3.23.4 ) .",
    "we establish an useful prescription for predicting dust extinction in the absence of h@xmath4 line or fir photometry ( section  3.5 ) . in section  4 , we present related analyses and discuss the dust properties of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we first provide a careful investigation of the systematic uncertainties associated with aperture correction for sdss data ( section  4.1 ) .",
    "we then discuss if we can really derive the dust extinction levels of galaxies by using stellar mass alone ( section  4.2 ) .",
    "we also discuss the relation between dust extinction and metallicity in section  4.3 .",
    "furthermore , in section  4.4 , we discuss the extra extinction towards nebular regions , and report its dependence on stellar mass and ew@xmath5 .",
    "finally , we will discuss if our new recipes can be applicable to high-@xmath1 galaxies using our high-@xmath1 galaxy sample ( section  4.5 ) .",

    "we use the spectroscopic catalogue of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements are performed by the max planck institute for astrophysics and johns hopkins university ( mpa / jhu group ) , and we make use of the `` value - added '' catalogues retrieved from their public website . the catalogue contains a total of 927,552 objects , of which 868,858 are identified as unique sources : we here perform internal matching using 2@xmath21 search radius to avoid duplicated objects .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the sample with a redshift range of 0.02@xmath0@xmath1@xmath00.10 , and exclude those having uncertain redshifts ( by applying z_warning@xmath220 ) . with these criteria , we have selected 344,425 objects .",
    "the redshift range adopted here was chosen so that we can study galaxies in a wide range in stellar mass , and at the same time we can minimise a potential effect of redshift evolution of galaxy properties within the sample .",
    "we note that a small change of the redshift range applied here does not affect our results .",
    "we select star - forming galaxies using the bpt diagram ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bpt diagnostics requires [ oiii]@xmath105007/h@xmath4 and [ nii]@xmath106584/h@xmath2 line flux ratio , and therefore these four major emission lines need to be detected .",
    "we first request s / n(h@xmath2)@xmath2310 ( as h@xmath2 line is usually the strongest ) , yielding 196,073 sample .",
    "we also request the following criteria for s / n ratio of the other three emission lines : s / n(h@xmath4)@xmath233 , s / n([nii])@xmath233 , s / n([oiii])@xmath232 .",
    "we note that [ oiii ] line is the weakest in most cases , and so we accept the [ oiii ] line detection down to s / n@xmath232 . after applying all these criteria ,",
    "177,033 galaxies are selected ( i.e.  @xmath2390% of the h@xmath2-selected galaxies ( with s / n@xmath2310 ) have significant detection at all the other three lines ) . following the recommendation by the mpa / jhu group , we scaled the uncertainty of h@xmath2 , h@xmath4 , [ nii ] , and [ oiii ] by 2.473 , 1.882 , 2.039 , and 1.566 , respectively .",
    "we also note that the line flux measurements provided in the mpa / jhu catalogue are continuum - subtracted ( and also corrected for galactic reddening ) , and so the effect of stellar absorption is properly taken into account .    following the prescription by @xcite , we select sf galaxies with : @xmath24/h\\beta } < 0.61/(\\log({\\rm [ nii]/h\\alpha})-0.05 ) + 1.3,\\ ] ] and we also apply [ nii]/h@xmath2@xmath00.6 to remove any seyfert galaxies or liners ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have now selected 145,923 _ star - forming _ galaxies .",
    "our final requirement for the sample selection is the availability of stellar mass estimates ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "we believe that this assumption is reasonable , as supported by previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and using our own sample , we also check the difference between fibre- and total - magnitudes ( at @xmath40-band ) as functions of various galaxy properties ( fig .",

    "we have established an empirical calibration for predicting @xmath3 using ( 1 ) stellar mass + h@xmath2/uv ratio , ( 2 ) ew@xmath5 + h@xmath2/uv ratio , and ( 3 ) stellar mass + ew@xmath5 . by comparing the @xmath3 value derived by balmer decrement and those from the newly proposed methods",
    ", we find that our new methods work reasonably well ( and successfully reduce the scatter around the best - fitted relation by @xmath61530% ) , with the `` mass + h@xmath2/uv '' method being the best .",
    "nevertheless , the other methods can also be useful in any future studies , particularly when stellar mass estimates and/or uv continuum information are not available .",
    "we find that @xmath3 for high - mass galaxies increases with increasing ew@xmath5 , whilst dust extinction does not increase with ew@xmath5 for low - mass systems , suggesting a different nature of sf activity for galaxies with different mass .",
    "we use akari fir data to derive uv extinction ( @xmath7 ) using ir / uv ratio , and test the stellar mass and ew@xmath5 dependence of the extra extinction correction factor towards the nebular region ( @xmath107 value , defined as @xmath113 ) .",
    "we find an interesting hint that the @xmath107 value is dependent on stellar mass or ew@xmath5 , with more massive galaxies or low ew@xmath5 galaxies having higher extra extinction towards nebular regions ( i.e.  smaller @xmath107 value ) .",
    "considering recent studies claiming higher @xmath107-value for high-@xmath1 galaxies , we argue that the dust geometry within high-@xmath1 sf galaxies resemble more like low - mass galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "an important caveat is that our empirical recipes for predicting dust extinction from h@xmath2/uv ratio implicitly incorporate this stellar mass and/or ew@xmath5 dependence of the @xmath107 value : e.g.  for massive galaxies our recipes automatically assume _ small _ @xmath107 value . if high - redshift galaxies tend to have _ larger _",
    "@xmath107 value than local counterparts with the same mass as often reported by recent studies , our empirical recipes established with local galaxy sample might _ over - estimate _ the dust extinction levels for high - redshift galaxies",
    ". however , the current high-@xmath1 galaxy sample ( with measured h@xmath2/h@xmath4 ratio ) is too small to test if our new recipes can be applicable to high-@xmath1 galaxies .",
