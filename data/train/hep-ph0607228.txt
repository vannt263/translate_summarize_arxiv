    "it is well known that fixed - order perturbation theory is not reliable for quantities involving several disparate scales . in such cases ,",
    "higher - order corrections are enhanced by large logarithms of scale ratios .",
    "the standard solution to this problem is to split the calculation into a series of single - scale problems by successively integrating out the physics associated with the largest remaining scale .",
    "perturbative logarithms are then resummed by renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution from the larger scales to the smaller ones . for collider processes",
    ", resummation is traditionally performed by other means , since it was not always clear how to systematically integrate out the physics associated with high scales in such cases .",
    "the simplest example of a high - energy process with a scale hierarchy which necessitates resummation is deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) in the threshold region . as the bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 , the invariant mass of the hadronic system produced in the decay , @xmath7 ( neglecting the nucleon mass ) , becomes much smaller than the momentum transfer @xmath8 .",
    "the presence of the two scales is manifest in the qcd factorization theorem @xcite @xmath9 for the non - singlet part of the structure function @xmath1 .",
    "the result ( [ eq : theorem ] ) is valid in the threshold region at leading power in @xmath10 and @xmath11 . as long as @xmath12 , both the jet function @xmath13 and the hard function @xmath14",
    "can be evaluated in perturbation theory , whereas the parton distribution function @xmath15 is a non - perturbative object .",
    "the result for the hard function involves single and ( sudakov ) double logarithms of the form @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , while the integral over the jet function produces logarithms @xmath18 .",
    "irrespective of the value of the renormalization scale @xmath19 , the fixed - order result contains large logarithms .",
    "traditionally , the resummation of these logarithms is performed in moment space .",
    "the threshold region of small @xmath20 is probed by large-@xmath21 moments .",
    "the relevant scale in mellin space is @xmath22 , so that the large perturbative logarithms depend on the moment parameter @xmath21 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that these logarithms can be absorbed into a resummation exponent @xmath23 , defined by integrals over two radiation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .\\ ] ] the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are determined by matching with results from fixed - order perturbation theory and are currently known at three - loop order , enabling a nearly complete threshold resummation to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( n@xmath29ll ) accuracy @xcite . the resummed momentum - space structure function @xmath1 is obtained from the moment - space expression by an inverse mellin transformation .",
    "this approach to threshold resummation has several drawbacks .",
    "the first is related to integrations over the landau pole in the running coupling .",
    "these occur twice : once in the integrals over the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the resummation exponent , and once again when the inverse mellin transform is taken to obtain results in momentum space . to perform the resummation one needs to specify a prescription for how to deal with these poles .",
    "various methods have been proposed in the literature , such as the `` minimal prescription '' @xcite or the `` tower expansion '' @xcite .",
    "the difference between these prescriptions is a power - suppressed effect .",
    "since factorization theorems do receive power corrections , this does not appear as a problem at first sight .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the landau - pole singularity in the resummed expression can induce large unphysical power corrections . in the example of the drell - yan process",
    ", the ambiguity in the threshold resummation amounts to a power correction of order @xmath30 , while the physical power corrections to the process scale as @xmath31 .",
    "the fact that resummations with rg methods @xcite do not involve landau - pole ambiguities illustrates that these effects do not have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , a landau - pole ambiguity does not necessarily imply the presence of a commensurate renormalon ambiguity @xcite .",
    "further drawbacks are that in the traditional resummation formalism the separation of contributions from the hard and jet scales is not transparent , and while the function @xmath27 has a clear interpretation as the cusp anomalous dimension familiar from the renormalization theory of wilson lines @xcite , the function @xmath28 is not easily identified with a field - theoretical object .",
    "in this paper we use rg techniques to perform the resummation of perturbative logarithms directly in momentum space .",
    "the starting point is the factorization formula ( [ eq : theorem ] ) , which we rederive using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite . in this framework",
    ", the hard function @xmath32 and the jet function @xmath33 are matching coefficients .",
    "the hard function arises from a first matching step , in which the electroweak current is matched onto a corresponding effective - theory current operator . in a second step , the partons associated with the hadronic final state are integrated out , giving rise to the jet function .",
    "threshold logarithms are resummed by solving the rg equations for these matching functions , using techniques presented in @xcite .",
    "existing results from higher - order perturbative calculations enable us to perform the matching and resummation up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in rg - improved perturbation theory , corresponding to the n@xmath29ll approximation in the standard approach .",
    "we show that the results obtained in momentum space are formally equivalent to the more familiar moment - space results by deriving a formula which connects them order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "however , integrals over the landau pole never appear in our momentum - space formulation , and the effective - theory matching functions and anomalous dimensions have a clear field - theoretical interpretation .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a simple analytic expression for the resummed structure function , while the mellin inversion which is necessary in the traditional approach can only be performed numerically . as a result , it is straightforward to match our resummed expressions onto fixed - order calculations valid outside the threshold region .",
    "finally , we stress that our approach to resummation in @xmath34-space is free of the pathologies related to large unphysical power ambiguities found in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it exhibits a better apparent perturbative convergence than the conventional approach .    in the context of scet , the generic factorization formula for dis has been discussed previously in @xcite , while the case @xmath0 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "these papers make conflicting statements about the factorization properties of dis in the endpoint region .",
    "most of the differences are resolved after observing that , near the endpoint , the parton distribution function receives contributions from two distinct non - perturbative modes . while the two modes can not be factorized perturbatively , their presence",
    "must nonetheless be taken into account to correctly translate the effective - theory result into the qcd factorization theorem ( [ eq : theorem ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the resummation was performed by solving the rg equations for the moments .",
    "this avoids landau - pole singularities in the exponent , but as we show here , it is possible to solve the equations directly in momentum space .",
    "while threshold resummation in dis is of limited phenomenological importance , it is a relatively simple process for which the perturbative results needed in our calculation are known at nnlo .",
    "for this reason , it provides an especially instructive example with which to develop our resummation formalism . however , many other processes fulfill factorization theorems of the same structure , in which the rate factorizes into a hard contribution times a jet function convoluted with a nonperturbative matrix element , and our formalism also applies to these cases .",
    "an example is heavy - particle production near threshold , which includes the drell - yan process in the limit where the invariant mass of the produced lepton pair is close to the center - of - mass energy in the collision , as well as higgs production in the same kinematic region .",
    "another example is provided by inclusive @xmath35-meson decays in the endpoint region .",
    "our final result for the resummed dis structure function is very similar to the factorized expression for radiative @xmath36 decay as derived in @xcite .",
    "in fact , both processes involve the same jet function , given by the quark propagator in light - cone gauge .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : factorization ] we use scet to obtain the qcd factorization formula for dis near the endpoint , providing a translation between the effective theory and standard discussions . in section  [ sec : resummation ]",
    "we work out the technique for threshold resummation in momentum space , derive a compact expression for the factorized structure function , and give results for the perturbative matching coefficients valid to nnlo in perturbation theory . in section",
    "[ sec : connection ] we convert our results to moment space and show how they are connected to those obtained in the standard approach .",
    "the appendix gives the perturbative expansions of the rg functions used in our analysis .",
    "in this section we derive the qcd factorization formula for the non - singlet dis structure function @xmath37 , using the technology of scet @xcite .",
    "we consider dis of electrons off a nuclear target , @xmath38 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "all non - trivial hadronic physics is encoded in the hadronic tensor @xmath39 averaged over the nucleon spin . here",
    "@xmath40 is the electromagnetic current .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of the kinematic invariants @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the momentum of the virtual photon , and @xmath34 is the bjorken scaling variable . for simplicity",
    "we focus on the flavor non - singlet component of the cross section , which is insensitive to the gluon distribution in the nucleon .",
    "it can be obtained by taking the difference of the dis cross sections for scattering off different target nuclei .",
    "kinematics of dis.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the first step in analyzing the hadronic tensor is to identify which momentum regions give non - vanishing contributions to the feynman diagrams for @xmath44 in perturbative qcd . each region is represented by a set of fields in scet .",
    "the identification of regions can be done in any lorentz frame .",
    "the number of modes and their relative scaling is lorentz invariant .",
    "two particularly convenient reference frames are the target rest frame , where @xmath45 with @xmath46 the nucleon mass , and the breit frame , where the virtual photon carries momentum @xmath47 .",
    "the two frames are related to each other by a lorentz boost along the @xmath48-direction . introducing the light - cone decomposition @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two light - like basis vectors ( @xmath52 ) , a generic momentum @xmath53 in the target rest frame transforms into @xmath54 in the breit frame , with the rapidity @xmath55 of the boost given by @xmath56",
    "we shall discuss the different regions in the breit frame , where the final - state hadronic jet moves along the @xmath48-direction , while the target nucleon moves in the opposite direction .",
    "the light - cone projections of the relevant momenta are ( all perpendicular components vanish by choice of coordinates ) @xmath57 where the neglected terms are of order @xmath58 .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath20 of the final - state hadronic jet is given by @xmath59 in the last step we have used that for an inclusive process the jet mass must be much larger than @xmath60 .",
    "otherwise , the cross section can not be analyzed using short - distance methods .",
    "while the momentum of the virtual photon is fixed by kinematics , the final - state jet and target nucleon consist of jets of near on - shell partons , whose momenta have scalings consistent with the relations above .",
    "we introduce a small expansion parameter @xmath61 and quote the components @xmath62 of parton momenta in units of @xmath8 . assume first that @xmath63 is not very close to 1 .",
    "then , for the purposes of power counting , it follows that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the partons making up the initial and final hadronic states have generic scalings @xmath67 where the term `` anti - collinear '' refers to collinear fields propagating in the negative @xmath48-direction .",
    "these relations change for the special case where @xmath34 is close to 1 , such that @xmath68 becomes parametrically small .",
    "the momentum of the final - state jet now scales like @xmath69 .",
    "while the valence quark in the target nucleon struck by the photon still carries an anti - collinear momentum @xmath70 , the remaining partons in the nucleon now have total momentum scaling like @xmath71 . consequently , the partons making up the final - state jet and the target remnant jet have momenta scaling like @xmath72 in these relations , the scaling of the perpendicular momentum components follows from the requirement that the individual partons be nearly on - shell .",
    "the terminology for the `` hard - collinear '' and `` soft - collinear '' modes follows @xcite and @xcite . in the traditional literature on factorization in dis @xcite",
    "the soft - collinear modes were referred to as `` soft '' .",
    "relation ( [ mx2 ] ) implies that @xmath73 , and there is no need to specify the relative scaling between @xmath74 and @xmath75 in more detail .",
    "all that matters for the factorization analysis is that @xmath76 is a perturbative scale , while @xmath77 is not .",
    "the discussion of factorization for the generic case , where @xmath63 but not very close to 1 , is straightforward @xcite .",
    "hard modes are described by qcd , whereas the anti - collinear partons making up the target nucleon can be described in scet .",
    "there is no need to include any other modes , since the only relevant regions are hard and anti - collinear . in interactions of the anti - collinear fields with hard fields ,",
    "only the large plus components @xmath78 of the anti - collinear momenta should be kept at leading order in power counting .",
    "correspondingly , the anti - collinear fields must be multipole expanded about @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "integrating out the hard modes by matching onto scet yields an expression for the discontinuity of the hadronic tensor of the form @xmath81\\,\\gamma^\\mu\\,\\frac{\\nslash}{2}\\ ,     \\gamma^\\nu\\,\\psi(0)\\,|n(p)\\rangle \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is a matching coefficient in the effective theory , and the object @xmath83 $ ] is a straight wilson line along the @xmath84 light - cone .",
    "we have used that the scet lagrangian for a single collinear sector is equivalent to the qcd lagrangian @xcite in order to replace the scet fields by the usual qcd fields .",
    "the identification of the nucleon matrix element with the qcd parton distribution function is then automatic ( see relation  ( [ phidef ] ) below ) , and one arrives at the standard factorization formula .",
    "the derivation of the factorization formula for @xmath0 is more complicated .",
    "it involves a two - step matching procedure similar to that used for inclusive semi - leptonic and radiative @xmath35 decays in the endpoint region @xcite . in a first matching step ,",
    "hard modes are integrated out by matching qcd onto a version of scet containing hard - collinear , anti - collinear , and soft - collinear fields .",
    "we will refer to this intermediate effective theory as scet(@xmath85 ) for short .",
    "the matching function associated with this first step is the hard coefficient @xmath86 . because the sum of a hard - collinear momentum and an anti - collinear momentum has an invariant mass @xmath87 and",
    "must be counted as hard , the intermediate effective lagrangian does not contain vertices coupling the hard - collinear fields to anti - collinear ones .",
    "these fields interact only through the exchange of soft - collinear `` messenger '' fields .",
    "however , the soft - collinear modes can be decoupled from the hard - collinear ones by means of a field redefinition .",
    "after this decoupling , it is possible to integrate out the hard - collinear scale by matching onto a low - energy theory scet(@xmath88 ) involving only anti - collinear and soft - collinear modes .",
    "the matching function associated with this step is the jet function @xmath33 . having integrated out the perturbative modes , the final step is to evaluate the matrix element of the remaining operator defined in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "an important part of the factorization analysis is to show that this matrix element is equivalent to the qcd parton distribution function evaluated in the limit @xmath0 , as studied e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case , and that the soft - collinear modes play an important role in this identification .",
    "the appropriate lagrangian for scet(@xmath85 ) is a generalization of the effective lagrangian for collinear and soft - collinear fields derived in @xcite .",
    "it contains hard - collinear quark and gluon fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 , anti - collinear quark and gluon fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and soft - collinear quark and gluon fields @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the hard - collinear fields move along the @xmath48-direction , and hence @xmath95 .",
    "the anti - collinear and soft - collinear fields move in the opposite direction , so @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the two collinear sectors can only interact via soft - collinear exchange , and at leading power only soft - collinear gluons are involved in these interactions .",
    "the corresponding effective lagrangian at leading order in the expansion parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 is @xcite @xmath98 \\xi_{hc }      - \\bar\\xi_{hc}\\,i\\dslash_{hc\\perp}\\,\\frac{\\nbslash}{2}\\ ,      \\frac{1}{i\\bar n\\cdot d_{hc}}\\,i\\dslash_{hc\\perp}\\,\\xi_{hc } \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\mbox{}+ \\bar\\xi_{\\bar c}\\,\\frac{\\nslash}{2 } \\left [      i\\bar n\\cdot d_{\\bar c } + g\\bar n\\cdot a_{sc}(y_+ ) \\right ] \\xi_{\\bar c }      - \\bar\\xi_{\\bar c}\\,i\\dslash_{\\bar c\\perp}\\,\\frac{\\nslash}{2}\\ ,      \\frac{1}{in\\cdot d_{\\bar c}}\\,i\\dslash_{\\bar c\\perp}\\,\\xi_{\\bar c }      \\nonumber\\\\[0.2 cm ]     & & \\mbox{}+ \\mbox{pure glue terms + soft - collinear lagrangian } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all fields without position argument are to be evaluated at the point @xmath99 .",
    "the effective lagrangian is invariant under a set of hard - collinear , anti - collinear , and soft - collinear gauge transformations , whose precise form can be found in @xcite .",
    "an important property of the scet lagrangian is that soft - collinear gluons can be decoupled from the hard - collinear and anti - collinear fields through field redefinitions involving wilson lines @xcite .",
    "this decoupling is essential for the factorization analysis below .",
    "diagrammatic factorization proofs also rely on the decoupling of `` soft '' gluons from collinear fields .",
    "the underlying physics is that soft gluons couple to collinear partons through eikonal vertices , a feature explicit in the scet lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "the first step in the factorization procedure is to integrate out hard fluctuations by matching qcd onto the intermediate effective theory scet(@xmath85 ) .",
    "the kinematic restrictions implied by the limit @xmath0 simplify this first matching step .",
    "since we are dealing with the region of phase space where the final - state jet is hard - collinear , there are no contributions to the hadronic tensor where the anti - collinear partons at points @xmath100 and @xmath34 are connected by hard gluons .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to integrate out hard fluctuations at the level of the electromagnetic current .",
    "time - ordered products of two currents are not needed until the second step .",
    "we match the qcd current @xmath101 onto a current in scet containing a hard - collinear quark and an anti - collinear anti - quark .",
    "the form of the resulting operator is dictated by gauge invariance .",
    "the appropriate matching relations for the qcd fields are @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the hard - collinear wilson line @xmath104 along the @xmath105-direction , and @xmath106 is the analogous anti - collinear wilson line along the @xmath84-direction .",
    "the multipole expansion in ( [ fieldmatch ] ) requires some explanation . in the hadronic tensor ( [ wdef ] ) ,",
    "the points @xmath100 and @xmath34 are connected by a hard - collinear jet propagating through a cloud of soft - collinear partons .",
    "this implies that the position argument @xmath34 scales as a hard - collinear quantity , @xmath107 .",
    "it follows that not all components of the anti - collinear and soft - collinear momenta must be kept in the calculation of feynman graphs in the effective theory .",
    "the minus and perpendicular components of anti - collinear and soft - collinear momenta are much smaller than the corresponding components of hard - collinear momenta and so should be expanded out .",
    "on the other hand , the large plus component @xmath108 of the target nucleon is canceled by the momentum component @xmath109 of the current and turned into a momentum component of order @xmath110 , which is of the same order as the plus component of a hard - collinear or soft - collinear momentum .",
    "for this reason , it would be incorrect to set @xmath111 in the argument of the soft - collinear fields entering the effective current operator , even though this is the correct multipole expansion of lagrangian interactions between soft - collinear and anti - collinear fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , when matching the current operator onto scet , one must multipole expand both the anti - collinear and soft - collinear fields about @xmath112 .",
    "the two expressions in ( [ fieldmatch ] ) are invariant under hard - collinear and anti - collinear gauge transformations , while under a soft - collinear gauge transformation both composite fields , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , transform into @xmath115 times themselves .",
    "thus , at tree level the gauge - invariant matching relation for the current is @xmath116 only a single dirac structure is possible for massless quarks .",
    "beyond tree level the matching relation at leading power gets generalized to ( see the analogous discussions in @xcite ) @xmath117 in the first line we have used that @xmath118 derivatives of hard - collinear fields are unsuppressed in scet power counting , allowing for arbitrary displacements of these fields along the @xmath105 light - cone . in the second line ,",
    "the object @xmath119 is the hard - collinear momentum operator , and the wilson coefficient @xmath86 is the fourier transform of the position - space wilson coefficient @xmath120 appearing in the first line . in the case at hand , the relevant components @xmath121 are fixed by kinematics ( see the relations ( [ scalings ] ) ) , and so we may write @xmath122 for simplicity .",
    "the next step in the matching procedure is to evaluate the hadronic tensor in the intermediate effective theory . inserting the scet current ( [ cvdef ] ) into ( [ wdef ] ) ,",
    "we find the leading - power expression @xmath123 the interactions of soft - collinear gluons with hard - collinear fields in ( [ leff ] ) can be removed by the field redefinitions @xcite @xmath124 which imply @xmath125 . here",
    "@xmath126 is a soft - collinear wilson line along the @xmath84-direction .",
    "the redefined hard - collinear fields with superscripts `` ( 0 ) '' are decoupled from soft - collinear fields and thus interact only among themselves .",
    "after the field redefinition the hadronic matrix element in ( [ step1 ] ) factorizes into a vacuum matrix element of hard - collinear fields and a nucleon matrix element of anti - collinear and soft - collinear fields . in the second matching step ,",
    "we `` integrate out ''",

    "color indices are suppressed ; the correlator is proportional to the unit matrix in color space .",

[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     further differences become apparent when studying the inverse mellin transformation needed to obtain the physical momentum - space results from the moment - space expressions .",
    "while our result ( [ beauty ] ) obtained directly in @xmath34-space is completely analytical , the inverse mellin transform can only be performed numerically , by evaluating the integral @xmath133 the mellin inversion is actually ambiguous , because the expression for @xmath134 has a landau pole for large @xmath21 .",
    "we deal with this pole by adopting the so - called minimal prescription @xcite , which amounts to excluding the landau pole from the integration contour by choosing the constant @xmath135 smaller than the value of @xmath21 at which the pole occurs .",
    "even with this prescription , the numerical integral is not well behaved in the limit @xmath0 , since the damping of the integrand becomes weaker and weaker as @xmath34 approaches the endpoint . in figure  [ comparisonmoment ]",
    "we compare the results for the @xmath34-space structure function obtained through numerical mellin inversion with those obtained directly in momentum space ( [ beauty ] ) .",
    "one source of numerical differences arises because the relation ( [ jlargen ] ) is only approximate , so that the solution to the rg equation for @xmath136 receives corrections which are suppressed as @xmath137 , while our momentum - space solution ( [ sonice ] ) is exact .",
    "another is that the default choice of the intermediate scale @xmath138 is different in the two approaches .",
    "the numerical differences are noticeable for smaller values of @xmath8 , but become negligible at @xmath139gev .    in the effective - theory result for the moments ,",
    "the landau pole in the inverse mellin transformation can be avoided by performing the inversion to @xmath34-space with the appropriate scale choice for momentum space , @xmath140 , instead of @xmath141 . the freedom to choose the scales as appropriate for",
    "the quantity under consideration is an important advantage of our approach .",
    "the landau - pole ambiguity in the mellin inversion is not the only problem that arises from the fact that the scales can not be varied in the standard resummation formalism .",
    "an additional difficulty was pointed out in @xcite . to illustrate it ,",
    "let us consider the structure function at the leading logarithmic level , even though this is not a consistent approximation in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "our result ( [ beauty ] ) then reduces to @xmath142 , \\ ] ] where we have approximated @xmath143 . from ( [ beauty ] ) , we see that we have to choose @xmath144 to make the double logarithms in the perturbative expansion of the hard matching coefficient @xmath122 small .",
    "similarly , to avoid the appearance of large logarithms in the associated jet function @xmath145 , the choice @xmath146 is mandatory .",
    "let us now look at the structure function integrated over the endpoint region @xmath147 in this case , the appropriate choice of the intermediate scale for integral @xmath148 is @xmath149 , as can be checked by explicitly performing the integral over ( [ beauty ] ) .",
    "if one instead chooses the scale @xmath138 to avoid logarithms on the level of the integrand , then the integral ( [ endint ] ) becomes singular . to see the problem",
    ", we set @xmath150 , @xmath151 and , for illustration purposes , approximate the sudakov factor by expanding it to leading order around fixed coupling @xmath152 , as was done in @xcite .",

    "because the exponential factor grows faster than any power as @xmath155 , this integral diverges .",
    "its expansion in @xmath156 is an asymptotic series with factorially growing terms . as was shown in @xcite",
    "the ambiguity associated with the non - integrable singularity for @xmath155 is of order @xmath157 for @xmath158 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the above divergence does not occur if the sudakov resummation is performed in moment space and the inverse transformation is performed exactly , without dropping subleading logarithms @xmath159 . from this",
    ", the authors concluded that the appropriate place to perform resummations is moment space and that leading logarithmic resummations in @xmath34-space are problematic .",
    "our analysis shows that it is simply a bad choice of scale that produces the problem of the spurious power correction : the usual moment - space formalism produces logarithms @xmath160 in the sudakov exponent , which translates into @xmath161 at leading logarithmic accuracy , which in turn causes the problem in ( [ div ] ) .",
    "however , the proper way to perform the calculation is to keep the matching scales arbitrary and choose them such that the final result of a given calculation does not contain large logarithms .",
    "this avoids the above problem as well as the occurrence of landau - pole ambiguities in inverse mellin transforms .",
    "we hope that the above discussion helps to overcome the misconception that mellin moment space is the `` correct place '' to perform the threshold resummation , and that resummation in @xmath34-space leads to inconsistent results .",
    "quite to the contrary , the final analytical formulae we obtain in momentum space are simpler than those derived in moment space , they are free of spurious , unphysical power ambiguities and , as figure  [ comparisonmoment ] shows , the perturbative expansion in @xmath34-space exhibits a better apparent convergence .",
    "we analyzed dis in the threshold region @xmath0 using scet . with a detailed analysis in the effective theory , we rederived the standard qcd factorization theorem @xcite for the non - singlet structure function @xmath37 . while this process had been investigated in the effective theory before @xcite",
    ", we argued that previous studies were incomplete .",
    "our analysis resolves the issues left open in these papers .",
    "we agree with @xcite that in a diagrammatic analysis momentum modes with low virtuality appear .",
    "their presence is a consequence of the fact that in the limit @xmath0 one parton carries nearly all the momentum of the nucleon and the characteristic scale associated with the target remnants is @xmath162 , at least in a perturbative analysis .",
    "however , here we have shown that these modes do _ not _ translate into non - perturbative @xmath8 dependence in the parton distribution function .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that such momentum regions do not contribute to the effective - theory calculation , and in @xcite that they would be screened away non - perturbatively . since these target remnants are part of the endpoint parton distribution function , it is incorrect to exclude them from the effective - theory factorization analysis , and there is no need to invoke a mechanism which eliminates them . for the same reason ,",
    "there are no extra `` soft '' contributions outside the parton distribution function , contrary to what was postulated in @xcite .    with the factorization theorem at hand",
    ", we then performed the resummation of large logarithms by solving the rg equations of the effective theory .",
    "our result involves three scales : a hard matching scale @xmath163 , a jet scale @xmath138 , and the factorization scale @xmath164 . by choosing the perturbative scales to satisfy @xmath144 and @xmath146",
    ", we avoid the presence of large logarithms .",
    "this approach has several advantages compared to the standard resummation technique for dis .",
    "it enables us to derive a simple analytic expression for the resummed structure function directly in @xmath34-space , thus circumventing the problems associated with moment - space resummation .",
    "we can also estimate the higher - order perturbative uncertainties by varying the matching scales .",
    "it is trivial to recover the fixed - order result by setting all scales equal , @xmath165 .",
    "this makes it straightforward to combine our results with fixed - order calculations valid away from the threshold region .",
    "an advantage of the effective - theory approach is that the resummed results are free of landau - pole ambiguities . in the standard approach , these appear twice : in the resummed exponent in moment space and also in the mellin inversion back to momentum space . since we perform the resummation in momentum space by integrating out the higher scales and using rg evolution to go to lower scales , our expressions do not involve the strong coupling constant evaluated at scales below the minimum of the intermediate matching scale and the factorization scale at which the parton distribution function is renormalized .",
    "therefore , landau - pole ambiguities do not arise at any finite order in perturbation theory .",
    "we showed that our results are formally equivalent to the standard ones order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "this allowed us to relate the radiation function @xmath28 to a combination of the anomalous dimension @xmath166 of the jet function and effective - theory matching coefficients .",
    "the two objects @xmath28 and @xmath166 are identical at leading order , but beyond this the relation is highly non - trivial .    since the parton distribution functions fall off very rapidly near @xmath0 , it is experimentally challenging to measure structure functions at large @xmath34 . for this reason",
    "the amount of available experimental information near threshold is very limited .",
    "however , because of its relative simplicity and since the perturbative quantities are known with high precision , the threshold resummation for dis has provided us with an ideal setup to develop our formalism . in the future",
    ", we plan to use the same approach to perform resummations in other , phenomenologically more relevant situations .",
