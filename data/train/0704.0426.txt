    "the first stars in the @xmath7cdm universe are believed to have formed inside dark - matter - dominated minihalos filled with mostly neutral , metal - free gas of virial temperature @xmath8 k , when @xmath1 molecules formed in sufficient abundance to cool the gas radiatively to @xmath9 k. if , as currently thought , these stars were massive , hot , and luminous , they may have contributed significantly to the reionization of the universe , which cmb polarization observations by wmap indicate was highly ionized by @xmath10 @xcite . the release of ionizing uv radiation by minihalos and other sources ( e.g. stars in more massive halos , with @xmath11 k , or miniquasars ) , required to explain reionization , must have been accompanied by radiation release at energies below the h lyman limit , as well , however .",
    "this may , in turn , have limited the @xmath1 abundance inside minihalos and their ability to form stars , thereby limiting their contribution to cosmic reionization .    in the absence of dust and at densities below the three - body formation regime ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) ,",
    "the most important reaction for the production of @xmath1 is @xmath14 ( e.g. , shapiro & kang 1987 and refs .",
    "therein ) with reaction rate @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "once formed , @xmath1 can be destroyed by collisions with other species @xmath16 or by photodissociation via lyman - werner band photon absorption @xmath17 the latter process becomes dominant once a substantial uv background is built up between 912 and 1110 @xmath18 , providing a feedback mechanism against the formation of new radiation sources @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the impact of another feedback mechanism , the photodissociation of @xmath0 , @xmath19 the cross - section for photodissociation of @xmath0 is well fitted by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the photon energy in ev .",
    "the cross section is zero below a threshold of @xmath22ev , the binding energy of the second electron . in the absence of the uv background ,",
    "the primary mode of @xmath0 destruction is the formation of @xmath1 ( eq . [ [ fh2 ] ] ) , ) mutual neutralization with @xmath23 can provide another efficient channel for @xmath0 destruction .",
    "however , typically the fractional ionization of minihalos is much lower .",
    "] so introducing the @xmath0 photodissociating flux reduces the @xmath1 formation rate by a factor @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the photodissociation rate per @xmath0 ion , @xmath26 is the hydrogen atom number density and @xmath27 is the number density of photons with energy @xmath21",
    ". breaks down when its value exceeds @xmath28 , since for such uv intensities @xmath29 reaction becomes a dominant channel of @xmath1 production ( assuming reaction rates given by @xcite ) .",
    "note also that @xmath30 is still uncertain to within a factor of a few ( see glover et al .",
    "2006 ) , and this uncertainty carries over to @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "] hence the importance of this mechanism depends primarily on the local density ratio of @xmath0 photodissociating photons and hydrogen atoms .",
    "the impact of @xmath0 photodissociation differs from that of @xmath33 by two fundamental characteristics .",
    "first , the time required for @xmath0 abundance to approach equilibrium is very short ( typically less than 10000 years ) , while for @xmath1 the equilibration time can exceed the hubble time . therefore ,",
    "when gas is exposed to a _ transient _ uv flux , produced by nearby pop iii stars , for example , @xmath0 photodissociation can generally be ignored , as it does not affect the subsequent thermal and chemical evolution .",
    "secondly , photons that make up the @xmath1 photodissociating background are destroyed after a few percent of the hubble time , as they redshift into one of the lyman series resonances , and must be replenished continuously . by contrast , photons that constitute the @xmath0 photodissociating background are very rarely destroyed , which allows them to accumulate over time .",
    "consequently the importance of @xmath0 photodissociation increases over time , and as we show in this paper , by the time a significant ( @xmath34 % ) fraction of the universe is ionized , @xmath35 photodissociation may result in a drastic reduction of the molecular hydrogen abundance .",
    "this in turn may lead to a reduced star formation rate and delay the progress of reionization .",
    "recently , @xcite considered the suppression of @xmath1 formation due to the photodissociation of @xmath0 and @xmath36 . whereas @xcite focused on the local feedback around and inside hii regions created by pop iii stars",
    ", we treat the problem globally and also consider long range effects due to the much lower optical depth of the universe below the lyman limit .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in  2 and 3",
    ", we estimate the intensity of @xmath0 photodissociating flux produced by uv and x - ray sources , respectively . in  4 , we discuss the implication of our results for gas cooling in minihalos .",
    "since the first radiation sources are expected to form within overdense gas clouds , only the escaping fraction of their ionizing photons , @xmath4 , was available for ionization of the diffuse igm .",
    "the rest was absorbed within the host halos and , via the process of radiative recombination , converted into lower energy uv photons . since the universe during that epoch is transparent to most non - ionizing uv photons , )",
    "lyman resonances , which , following their absorption by hydrogen atoms , are further split into two or more lower energy photons . for ly@xmath37 photons ,",
    "the optical depth is also very high , but in their case the absorption in almost all cases is followed by reemission , with the destruction probability being extremely low @xcite .",
    "also , at the very early stage of reionization ( @xmath38 ) the presence of @xmath39 molecules makes the universe opaque in the lyman - werner range .",
    "however , since their initial abundance ( @xmath40 ) is already very low , the number of photons they destroy is negligible .",
    "] almost all of them add to the @xmath0 photodissociation background .    neglecting recombinations in the diffuse igm , the mean",
    "ionization is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the total number of ionizing photons per baryon produced up to this point . inside halos ,",
    "the recombination time is quite short , and so the number of ionizations taking place there , @xmath43 , is almost equal to the number of electron recombinations to @xmath44 states ( i.e. , recombinations which do not result in emission of additional ionizing photons ) , @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the average @xmath0 photodissociating rate is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mean baryon density and @xmath48 is the average cross - section per recombination photon times the average number of photons per recombination , @xmath49 .",
    "note that since emissivity , @xmath50 , is proportional to @xmath51 , @xmath48 is in fact independent of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . using osterbrock s ( 1989 , sec .",
    "4.3 ) calculation of the recombination spectrum , @xmath54 , and assuming that the temperature of the recombining gas is close to @xmath55 k , we find @xmath56 .    by combining equations ( [ sup ] ) and ( [ zet ] ) , we can estimate the importance of the @xmath0 photodissociation due to recombination radiation . assuming that most of the recombinations occurred recently , we find that , the recombination radiation alone will suppress the @xmath1 formation rate by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the local overdensity . here",
    "we have neglected recombinations in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the associated @xmath0 dissociating photons from these recombinations , but these would only further increase @xmath59 .",
    "cosmological redshift can affect the photodissociation rate by shifting the spectrum to longer wavelengths .",
    "initially this leads to an increase in @xmath60 due to the @xmath61 dependence of the cross - section for @xmath62 ev .",
    "eventually , as more and more of the spectrum is shifted below the threshold , the cosmological redshift begins to decrease the dissociation rate .",
    "for recombination photons this redshift effect is small , and the transition to @xmath60-depression occurs at a redshift factor of @xmath63 , see figure  [ fig : zdep ] .",
    "unlike ionizing photons , whose intensity is heavily attenuated both in stellar atmospheres and in their host galaxies , most of the photons with frequencies below the lyman limit escape freely into the igm . from then on , photons with frequency below",
    "ly@xmath64 undergo no evolution apart from cosmological redshift . by contrast , within a small fraction of the hubble time , most photons with frequency between ly@xmath64 and the lyman limit are split by cascade into two or more photons after being redshifted into one of the hydrogen resonances .",
    "most of the cascade products , which include lines such as ly@xmath37 , h@xmath37 , and h@xmath64 , as well as a continuum spectrum produced by the two photon transition @xmath65 , are above the @xmath66 ev threshold for @xmath0 photodissociation .",
    "the relative importance of these directly emitted @xmath0 dissociating photons depends on the nature of the uv sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : zetaratio ] shows the increase of the @xmath0 dissociation rate due to inclusion of direct emission from metal - poor pop iii stars , which we calculated using the stellar atmosphere models of @xcite .",
    "predictably , for very massive pop iii stars , with surface temperatures @xmath67 k , adding the stellar continuum below the lyman limit to the recombination spectrum increases the photodissociation rate by only @xmath68 .",
    "if , on the other hand , most of the early ionizing flux was produced by stars with masses below @xmath69 , whose continuum emission is stronger at lower frequencies , then the total @xmath0 dissociation rate would be tripled at least .",
    "likewise , direct emission may be important if most of the uv photons were produced by miniquasars .",
    "for example , assuming that their spectrum can be approximated by a power law , @xmath70 , with a cutoff below @xmath71 ev , adding the directly emitted photons to the recombination products increases the total photodissociation rate by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "it has been suggested that x - ray photons could contribute a large fraction of the energy emitted by the first radiation sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by increasing the number of free electrons , x - rays can boost the production of @xmath0 , and thus of @xmath1 , providing a positive feedback to the formation of new sources @xcite .",
    "this effect , however , would be at least partially offset by an increase of the @xmath0 photodissociating background , caused by conversion of x - rays into uv photons .",
    "the absorption of an x - ray photon is followed by release of a non - thermal electron , which then loses some of its energy by inelastic collisions with atoms before it can thermalize its energy by elastic scattering with ions and other electrons .",
    "when the gas ionization fraction is low ( @xmath73 ) , the photoelectron splits most of its energy evenly between collisional ionizations and excitations of hydrogen atoms @xcite . using electron - hydrogen excitation cross - sections @xcite",
    ", we find that around @xmath74 of the excitations are to the 2p level , which are followed by emission of a ly@xmath37 photon .",
    "most of the remaining excitations are to the 3p level , which decays via emission of one h@xmath37 photon and a subsequent two - photon decay from the 2s level .",
    "the ly@xmath37 , h@xmath37 and two - photon continuum each produce roughly equal contributions to @xmath0 photodissociation . per ionization",
    ", the average intensity - weighted cross - section for these photons is @xmath75 . due to the low number of uv photons produced during this phase ,",
    "the formation of @xmath1 is not strongly affected @xmath76    after the ionized fraction climbs above @xmath77 , most of the energy of the non - thermal electrons is converted to heat .",
    "however , simultaneously with the growth of the ionized fraction , the temperature of the gas rises , and as it crosses @xmath55 k , the collisions between thermal electrons and atoms begin to dissipate the energy added by x - rays , mainly via emission of ly@xmath37 photons . neglecting gas clumping",
    ", we find that the number of emitted ly@xmath37 photons per hydrogen atom is @xmath78 assuming for simplicity that @xmath3 and @xmath79 are constants , we can rewrite the equation ( [ na ] ) as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the thompson optical depth from the epoch of partial ionization by x - rays .",
    "if x - ray preionization contributes at least half of the @xmath82 measured by wmap ( i.e. @xmath83 ) , hydrogen atomic de - excitations in the diffuse igm may produce @xmath84 ly@xmath37 photons per baryon .",
    "the suppression of @xmath1 formation due to @xmath0 photodissociation by ly@xmath37 photons is @xmath85 since the energy of ly@xmath37 photons ( 10.2 ev ) is far above the @xmath86 photodissociation threshold ( 0.75 ev ) , the photodissociation rate grows roughly as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the redshift at which the photon was emitted . in the case of an extended period of partial ionization , @xmath59 may be increased by a factor of a few , possibly exceeding @xmath89 .",
    "since , when the igm temperature rises above @xmath55 k , the formation of new minihalos is suppressed , the impact of @xmath86 photodissociating flux produced by x - ray conversion is relevant only for minihalos which have formed some time ago or for halos with @xmath11 k , which also rely on @xmath1 cooling to form stars .",
    "as shown by our calculations , @xmath0 photodissociation reduces the formation of @xmath1 molecules by a factor of @xmath90 where @xmath6 is a constant of order a few , whose value depends on the type of radiation source and the growth history of the radiation background .",
    "thus , by the time a significant fraction ( @xmath91 ) of the universe becomes ionized , @xmath0 photodissociation can significantly reduce the @xmath1 formation rate in regions with overdensities of up to a few thousands , i.e. in the interior regions of minihalos .",
    "the equilibrium abundance of molecular hydrogen during this stage would be determined by the balance between its formation and destruction rates ( eqs .",
    "[ [ fh2 ] ] and [ [ fdes ] ] ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath1 destruction rate by the lyman - werner photons .",
    "thus a reduction of @xmath0 abundance by a factor @xmath59 translates into the same reduction of the @xmath1 abundance and , in minihalos , a comparable increase of the cooling time .",
    "indirectly , @xmath0 photodissociation may affect the cooling in the central regions of minihalos even during the early stages of reionization .",
    "the maximum density that gas can reach in the core region of a minihalo is limited by the amount of entropy it is able to radiate away during collapse .",
    "the lower density gas prevalent during the early collapse phase would be susceptible to @xmath0 dissociation from even a relatively low intensity @xmath0 dissociating flux , and the resulting lowered @xmath1 abundance would limit its ability to radiate away entropy via @xmath1 cooling .",
    "furthermore , the density and @xmath1 abundance at the center depend on the conditions in the low density outer regions , through their contributions to both the total pressure and the self - shielding ability of the halo .",
    "we plan to investigate these effects further with numerical radiation - hydrodynamic simulations in the future .",
