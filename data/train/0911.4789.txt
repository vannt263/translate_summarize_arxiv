    "the study of rare kaon decays @xcite has played an important role in the establishment of the standard model ( sm ) in particle physics .",
    "it has also been crucial for understanding the phenomenon of cp violation @xcite .",
    "the rare decay @xcite is a direct cp violation process caused by a flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) with transition from a strange to down quark .",
    "the unique characteristic of the decay is that the branching ratio can be calculated with very small theoretical uncertainties . in the sm based on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite for quark flavor mixing",
    ", the branching ratio is predicted to be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the prediction is dominated by the allowed range of the imaginary part of a ckm matrix element @xmath2 , which is determined by other measurements , and the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty is only 1 - 2% @xcite .    the determination of ckm matrix elements has been greatly improved in the past ten years by measuring various b - decay properties @xcite ; all measurements were consistent with each other within the standard model parameterization . by measuring the decay precisely , we can check the consistency against the currently predicted value in the sm .",
    "a deviation indicates new physics beyond the sm because of the very small uncertainty in deriving the imaginary part of @xmath2 from the branching ratio of the decay .",
    "the decay is one of the processes expected to have a significant impact on new physics searches because it is an fcnc process that can proceed through loop diagrams , including the interactions at short distance and large mass scales .",
    "grossman and nir @xcite pointed out the importance of studying new physics by using both the and decays , where the decay is another rare kaon decay with small theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "various new physics models have been developed and used to predict the and branching ratios @xcite .",
    "the best upper limit obtained in previous experiments was br ( ) @xmath3 5.9 @xmath4 10@xmath5 ( 90% cl ) @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of our experimental study is to determine the branching ratio with an accuracy less than 10% of the value predicted in the sm .",
    "the goal can be achieved by performing a series of experiments with improved and refined detection methods .",
    "the e391a experiment , which was carried out at the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron ( kek - ps ) , is the first step of this approach .",
    "the main objectives of e391a were not only to investigate the decay with a dedicated detector , but also to test and confirm our basic experimental methods for at the highest possible sensitivity .",
    "data collection of the e391a experiment started in february 2004 and continued until november 2005 , which was one month before the shutdown of the kek - ps .",
    "the total running time was about twelve months and it was divided into three periods ( run-1 , run-2 , and run-3 ) .",

    ", we report the final results on the decay as obtained from e391a .",
    "the key signature of the decay is detection of exactly two photons and nothing else .",
    "the decays dominantly into two photons ( @xmath6 ) , and the neutrinos are undetectable . because detection of the incident is difficult , measurements can only be made of the energy and position of the two photons in a calorimeter located downstream of the decay region , without having direct information of the incident particle .",
    "kinematic constraints are weak for definitive identification of the decay . instead",
    ", the decay must be isolated by eliminating all possible backgrounds .",
    "because the signal mode is identified as the final state of two photons and nothing else , processes that make two or more photons can cause background events .",
    "the decays such as and become backgrounds when extra photons or charged particles escape detection .",
    "the decay can be a background source because it has only two photons in the final state , although it is well suppressed by kinematical constraints .",
    "another background process is hadronic interactions of beam neutrons with the residual gas in the beamline or in detectors near the beam .",
    "any or @xmath7 produced in these interactions decay into two photons and produce backgrounds .",
    "hyperons produced at the target can cause backgrounds through processes such as @xmath8 ; these hyperon events are strongly suppressed because most of them decay in a 10 m long neutral beamline .    the most important tool for reducing the background is a hermetic detector system to detect and veto extra particles .",
    "because all of the other decays , except for , are accompanied with at least two additional photons or charged particles , the detector should be highly sensitive to photons and charged particles .",
    "the signature of can be provided by using a small - diameter beam ( called a  pencil beam \" ) and measuring precisely the energy and position of the two photons .",
    "although flux is reduced with a pencil beam , it has several advantages .",
    "first , the beam hole at the center of the calorimeter , which compromises hermeticity , can be minimized .",
    "secondly , the decay vertex position ( ) can be assumed to be on the beam axis .",
    "the vertex position , which is same as the decay position due to the short lifetime of , is obtained from the kinematics of the two photons from its decay ( see sec .",
    "the transverse momentum of the ( ) with respect to the beam axis is also obtained .",
    "the signal region for decay can be defined with and .",
    "requiring a sufficiently large missing transverse momentum eliminates contamination from the decay and also reduces the contamination of other decays .",
    "most of the s decay into multiple particles that have low momenta in the rest frame , and hence low in the laboratory frame .",
    "the should be in the region away from beam counters and should be in the range from 120 to 240 mev/@xmath9 , where the maximum momentum of s in the -rest frame is 231 mev/@xmath9 for .",
    "production of s through beam - gas interactions in the decay fiducial region are reduced by having a high vacuum .",
    "hit - rates of the beam halo ( mostly neutrons ) with the surrounding detectors are minimized by a sharp collimation of the beam .",
    "in addition , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii.a and in the subsequent analysis of the data , mis - combinations of two photons from background processes and/or mis - measurements of energies and positions were found to be major sources of backgrounds in the e391a experiment .",
    "the photons were often produced from interactions of the beam halo and can lead to incorrect determinations of .",
    "some backgrounds from beam interactions can be reduced by detecting low - energy deposits from recoil particles emitted after the interactions .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the detection method have been reported in the original proposal of e391a @xcite .",
    "inefficiencies of photon and charged particle detection provide backgrounds .",
    "the decay is the most serious background source arising from an inefficiency because it has only two extra photons in the final state .",
    "the inefficiency of photon detection was investigated in a series of experiments @xcite , which showed that the inefficiency monotonically decreased with the incident photon energy .",
    "it was also found that photon detection with a very low energy threshold is necessary to achieve a small overall inefficiency , even for high - energy photons .",
    "if an extremely low energy threshold around 1 mev was set , the backgrounds from other decays were reduced to a negligible level within the sensitivity of the experiment .",
