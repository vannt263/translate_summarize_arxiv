    "<S> we analyzed the results of non - linear resistive magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of jet formation to study the acceleration mechanism of axisymmetric , resistive mhd jets . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is a constant angular momentum , polytropic torus threaded by weak uniform vertical magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the torus is simulated by applying the cip - mocct scheme extended for resistive mhd equations . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out simulations up to 50 rotation period at the innermost radius of the disk created by accretion from the torus . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration forces and the characteristics of resistive jets were studied by computing forces acting on lagrangian test particles . </S>",
    "<S> since the angle between the rotation axis of the disk and magnetic field lines is smaller in resistive models than in ideal mhd models , magnetocentrifugal acceleration is smaller . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential along a magnetic field line has maximum around @xmath0 in resistive models , where @xmath1 is the radius where the density of the initial torus is maximum . </S>",
    "<S> jets are launched after the disk material is lifted to this height by pressure gradient force . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the main acceleration force around the slow magnetosonic point is the magnetocentrifugal force . </S>",
    "<S> the power of the resistive mhd jet is comparable to the mechanical energy liberated in the disk by mass accretion . </S>",
    "<S> joule heating is not essential for the formation of jets . </S>"
