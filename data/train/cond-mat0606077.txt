    "the photophysics of semiconducting single - walled carbon nanotubes ( s - swcnts ) are of strong current interest because of their potential applications in optoelectronics .",
    "@xcite recent theoretical works have emphasized the coulomb - induced binding between the optically excited electron and hole in these systems .",
    "@xcite the excitonic energy spectra of s - swcnts are now understood qualitatively : there occur in these nanotubes a series of energy manifolds labeled by an index @xmath1 = 1 , 2 , ... etc .",
    ", with each manifold containing both optically allowed and dark exciton states , and a continuum band separated from the optical exciton by a characteristic exciton binding energy .",
    "nonlinear optical absorption measurements have demonstrated that distinct energy gaps occur between the lowest two - photon allowed states and the @xmath1 = 1 optical excitons .",
    "@xcite this energy gap is a lower bound to the binding energy of the @xmath1 = 1 optical exciton.@xcite nonlinear absorption measurements involving the @xmath2 continuum band @xcite and the @xmath3 exciton @xcite have also been performed .",
    "exciton formation in s - swcnts is a consequence of direct coulomb electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction , taking proper account of which is a notoriously difficult many - body problem",
    ". theoretical calculations of excitons and continuum band energies in the s - swcnts are therefore necessarily approximate .",
    "one semiquantitative approach that has been popular employs an _ ab initio _",
    "approach for the ground state , which is followed by the determination of the quasiparticle energies within the gw approximation and the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation of the two - particle green s function .",
    "@xcite this approach becomes difficult to implement for chiral s - swcnts with large diameters and large unit cells , precisely the systems for which the nonlinear optical measurements are being performed .",
    "@xcite scaling relationships for the exciton binding energies in wider chiral nanotubes have therefore been proposed .",
    "@xcite understanding nonlinear absorption within such indirect approaches is difficult .",
    "an alternate approach to the exciton problem in the s - swcnts is to adopt a semiempirical @xmath0-electron approximation @xcite that is widely used to describe _ planar _ @xmath0-conjugated systems .",
    "the model assumes that the lowest energy excitations in planar conjugated systems involves the @xmath0-electrons only and ignores the electrons occupying orthogonal @xmath4-bands .",
    "since @xmath0@xmath5 excitation energies decrease rapidly with increasing system size , while the @xmath4 and @xmath6 bands are nearly dispersionless , the approximation is excellent for large systems .",
    "thus @xmath0-conjugated polymers ( pcps ) have been discussed extensively within the semiempirical pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) hamiltonian , @xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8 creates a @xmath0-electron with spin @xmath4 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) in the @xmath11 orbital of the @xmath12th carbon atom , @xmath13 implies nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "atoms @xmath12 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the number of @xmath0-electrons with spin @xmath4 on the atom @xmath12 , and @xmath16 is the total number of @xmath0-electrons on the atom .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the one - electron hopping integral between @xmath11 orbitals of n.n .",
    "carbon atoms , @xmath18 is the on - site e - e repulsion between two @xmath0-electrons occupying the same carbon atom @xmath11 orbital , and @xmath19 is the intersite e - e interaction .",
    "the semiempirical model suffers from the disadvantage that determination of the parameters is commonly difficult . on the other hand , many - body problems that would be formidable within the _ ab initio _ approach , such as the enhancement of the ground state bond - alternation in polyacetylene by e - e interactions , @xcite or the occurrence of the lowest two - photon state below the optical state in finite polyenes and polyacetylene ,",
    "@xcite can be understood within eq .",
    "the semiempirical approach should thus be taken as complementary to the _ ab initio _ one .",
    "the above observations were the basis of our calculations within eq .",
    "( 1 ) of the electronic structures and exciton binding energies , @xcite and more recently , nonlinear optical absorptions @xcite in a limited number of s - swcnts , in spite of their nonplanarity",
    ". justification of this procedure can also be found in earlier work claiming that curvature effects of fullerene molecules can be included within eq .",
    "( 1 ) by proper modifications of the parameters . @xcite the e - e interaction and hopping integral parameters used in our calculations were the same ones that had been used earlier for the pcp poly - paraphenylenevinylene ( ppv ) .",
    "@xcite the calculated energy differences ( @xmath20 0.30.4 ev ) between dominant two - photon states observed in ultrafast spectroscopy and the @xmath2 optical excitons , in s - swcnts with diameters d @xmath21 0.8 nm , were remarkably close to what are observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite other experimental work @xcite have also determined the binding energy of the @xmath22 optical exciton in s - swcnts with diameters 0.81.0 nm to be @xmath200.4 ev , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "very recent work has also confirmed the predicted binding energy of the @xmath23 exciton in two different s - swcnts.@xcite    the calculated _ absolute energies _ of the @xmath1 = 1 and 2 excitons s - swcnts in our earlier work , @xcite however , are much larger than the experimental values ( by as much as 0.5 ev ) .",
    "equally importantly , comparisons of experimental and calculated exciton binding energies were based on considerations of diameters alone : while the nanotubes probed experimentally are chiral with large diameters , the theoretical calculations were either for zigzag nanotubes or for narrow chiral nanotubes , both with smaller unit cells .",
    "direct comparisons of theory and experiment for the same systems were thus not possible .",
    "finally , because the theoretical calculations could be performed for only a handful of nanotubes , family relationships , established experimentally , @xcite could not be demonstrated within the theoretical model .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report calculated energy spectra of 29 s - swcnts , only 9 of which are zigzag , within eq .",
    "the diameters of the s - swcnts we consider range from 0.56 to 1.51 nm .",
    "these calculations have been possible because of substantive improvements in our computational techniques , while the improved results are a consequence of careful parametrization of the n.n .",
    "hopping integral @xmath24 that takes into account curvature effects ( see below ) .",
    "for each s - swcnt we calculate the absolute energies @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the @xmath1 = 1 and 2 optical excitons , and their binding energies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "we compare all theoretical quantities to experimentally determined ones .",
    "@xcite the large number of s - swcnts that could be considered allows us to investigate family relationships based on calculations of the energy ratio @xmath29 and to compare these data to experiments .",
    "@xcite we find excellent agreement between the theory and experiments .",
    "our work demonstrates convincingly that the photophysics of s - swcnts and pcps can be understood within the same general theoretical framework , albeit with different hopping integrals .",
    "we use the single configuration interaction ( sci ) approximation to compute the energies of the one electron - one hole excitations of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "the sci approximation includes configuration mixings only between excitations that are singly excited from the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state .",
    "the justifications for the approximation have been given before.@xcite    we discuss next how the parametrizations within eq .",
    "( 1 ) were reached .",
    "since e - e interactions depend only on the distance and not on the curvature of the s - swcnts , it is logical to parametrize the @xmath19 exactly as in the pcps , @xcite viz .",
    ", @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance between carbon atoms @xmath12 and @xmath14 in  .",
    "the two free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) are @xmath18 and @xmath32 ; the latter is introduced to take into account the dielectric screening due to the medium .",
    "@xcite @xmath18 = 11.26 ev and @xmath32 = 1 correspond to the standard ohno parametrization for finite molecules .",
    "@xcite sci calculations of the optical absorption in ppv with five different @xmath18 ( between 0 to 10 ev ) and three different @xmath32 ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) had indicated that only with @xmath18 = 8 ev and @xmath32 = 2 was it possible to fit all four absorption bands at 2.4 , 3.7 , 4.7 , and 6.0 ev in ppv .",
    "the same @xmath18 and @xmath32 were then used for quantitative calculations of nonlinear and triplet absorptions in ppv .",
    "experimentally determined energies of the two - photon state that dominates nonlinear optical spectroscopy @xcite and the lowest triplet state @xcite agreed remarkably well with the theory .",
    "we have used the same @xmath18 and @xmath32 for s - swcnts .    .",
    "calculated and experimental ( ref .  ) @xmath1 = 1 and 2 exciton energies for three zigzag s - swcnts . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  ii we have listed our calculated @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for 29 s - swcnts .",
    "we compare each of these quantities to those obtained by experimental investigators .",
    "@xcite nearly half the exciton energies listed in table  ii as experimental were obtained directly from spectroflurometric measurements@xcite or from resonant raman spectroscopy.@xcite using the experimental data in ref .",
    ", weisman and bachilo@xcite derived empirical equations for the exciton energies of nanotubes for which direct experimental information do not exist .",
    "the experimental @xmath25 and @xmath26 in table  i are obtained from these empirical equations .",
    "et al._@xcite have given an empirical equation for the binding energy of the @xmath22 exciton , which was also derived by fitting the set of @xmath27 obtained from direct measurements .",
    "only two measured values exist currently for the binding energy of @xmath23 exciton . @xcite",
    "we make distinctions between the experimental and empirical data in table  ii , but in the text below we refer to both as experimental quantities . in fig .  1 we have plotted the theoretical and experimental @xmath25 and @xmath26 against @xmath33 , while in fig",
    ".  1 inset we show the errors in our calculations , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , defined as the calculated energies minus the experimental quantities . as seen in the figure the theoretical plots are nearly independent of chirality , and depend primarily on diameter .",
    "this is a consequence of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , within which the energetics depend only on the conductivity",
    ". we find excellent agreement between calculated and experimental @xmath25 for @xmath36 nm , with @xmath37 ev .",
    "( the black arrow on the x - axis in fig .",
    "1 indicates @xmath38 nm . )",
    "the agreement for @xmath39 nm is even better with @xmath40 ev .",
    "the larger disagreement with experiment ( and the greater chirality dependency of the experimental energies ) for @xmath41 nm is due to the breakdown of the @xmath0-electron approximation .",
    "the disagreements between calculated and experimental @xmath26 are larger , but even here the magnitude of the maximum error for @xmath36 nm is within 0.2 ev , which is the c  c bond stretching frequency that can influence experimental estimation of exciton energies .",
    "@xcite the origin of the larger disagreement in the @xmath23 region is the sci approximation and not the @xmath0-electron model : inclusion of higher order ci is more important in general for higher energy states .",
    "the agreement between the calculated and the experimental exciton binding energies in table  ii is even more striking than the fits to the absolute energies .",
    "the discrepancies between theory and experiment is less than 10% , which is the uncertainty in the empirical binding energies .",
    "@xcite both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are inversely proportional to the diameter @xmath42 and can be fitted approximately by    @xmath43    the exciton binding energies depend weakly on chirality .",
    "for both binding energies , the fits of eq .",
    "( 3 ) become better for larger diameter nanotubes .",
    "eq .  ( 3a )",
    "is remarkably close to the empirical formula @xmath44 ev given in previous experimental work .",
    "@xcite although there are not enough experimental data to verify the @xmath28 relation in eq .",
    "( 3b ) , the linear dependence against @xmath33 should be true for both binding energies .",
    "the calculated @xmath27 and @xmath28 are very close to those obtained earlier by us for the wide nanotubes with @xmath45 ev , @xcite even as the calculated @xmath25 and @xmath26 are now quite different .",
    "this is simply a consequence of localization of the electrons at the large @xmath46 considered here : exciton binding energies in this case depend primarily on electron correlation .",
    "recall , for example , that in the limit where the intersite coulomb interaction is cut off beyond the n.n .",
    "interaction @xmath47 , the exciton binding energy is determined almost entirely by the difference in coulomb interactions @xmath48 , @xcite with @xmath49 playing a weak role for @xmath50 .    /@xmath25 vs.  the wavelength @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "the blue solid line with circle symbols ( red dashed line with triangle symbols ) denote families @xmath52 ( 2 ) .",
    ", width=324 ]    our ability to calculate @xmath25 and @xmath26 for a large number of nanotubes allows us to demonstrate family behavior within eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which was not possible before .",
    "it has been shown that in plots of experimental @xmath29 against the wavelength @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath26 , families of ( @xmath53 ) s - swcnts with the same @xmath54 lie on the same continuous curves . @xcite",
    "the experimental energy ratios diverge from a central limiting number @xmath201.75 , with the deviations increasing with @xmath54 , and with the direction of the deviation being positive for the families @xmath55 3 = 1 and negative for the families @xmath56 3 = 2 , respectively .",
    "@xcite in fig .  2 we have plotted our calculated @xmath29 against the calculated @xmath51 .",
    "the calculated ratios do not show the same smooth behavior as in ref .",
    ", since as already noticed in fig .  1 inset our errors with @xmath26 are larger than those with @xmath25 . nevertheless , _ two different classes of behavior _",
    ", for the families @xmath57 3 = 1 and @xmath57 3 = 2 are very clear . the difference between the largest and the smallest ratios in the narrow diameter ( small @xmath51 ) end is smaller than what is seen experimentally , but this is once again merely a consequence of the larger errors in our calculations for the narrower nanotubes .",
    "more importantly , the limiting @xmath29 in the wide diameter ( large @xmath51 ) end in fig .",
    "2 is very close to the experimental limiting ratio of 1.75 .",
    "in summary , direct calculations of the energy spectra of a large number of s - swcnts within the @xmath0-electron ppp model hamiltonian and with a fixed set of parameters show excellent agreement with experiments .",
    "the magnitudes of two of the three free parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath32 for coulomb interactions , are the same as those used earlier to calculate the energy spectrum of ppv;@xcite the third free parameter @xmath49 is obtained by fitting the energetics of three zigzag s - swcnts to account for the curvature effects . the calculated exciton energies and exciton binding energies in the first two manifolds are in excellent agreement with experiments , and the `` family behavior ''",
    "is demonstrated . in the diameter range of our calculated s - swcnts , we found linear dependence against @xmath33 for the binding energies of excitons in both manifolds .",
    "it is unlikely that the agreement between theory and experiments is fortuitous .",
    "the coulomb parameters used here were obtained after extensive search through a very large parameter space for ppv , and the same parameters successfully reproduced the energies of the dominant two - photon state @xcite and the triplet energy spectrum @xcite of ppv .",
    "similarly , slightly smaller hopping in s - swcnts than in ppv is to be expected.@xcite our work demonstrates a universality in the photophysics of s - swcnts and pcps that arises from their common quasi - one - dimensionality and @xmath0-conjugation .",
