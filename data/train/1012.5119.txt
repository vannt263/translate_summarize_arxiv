    "the concept of metamaterials have drawn a strong interest ever since fabrication and characterization of such structures became feasible .",
    "the ability to engineer the metamaterial elements ( `` meta - atoms '' ) in a largely arbitrary fashion adds a whole new dimension of freedom in material science .",
    "artificial materials show promise for a wide range of unusual physical phenomena , some of which are rare or absent in nature .",
    "examples include negative refraction , @xcite hyperbolic dispersion relation resulting in anomalously high density of states in a wide frequency range , @xcite or support for transformation optics , @xcite offering superior degree of control over light propagation and guiding .",
    "more specifically , if the shape of the meta - atoms is chiral , i.e. , when the meta - atom can not be superimposed with its own mirror image , such metamaterials resemble naturally occurring optically active media and outperform them by orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite more recently , following a seminal paper by plum et al , @xcite _ planar chiral metamaterials _ ( pcms ) were introduced .",
    "they consist of planar meta - atoms on a flat substrate @xcite that can not be superimposed with their _ in - plane _ mirror image without being lifted off the plane . in other words ,",
    "truly chiral metamaterials possess distinct 3d enantiomers while pcms do not , but can be said to possess distinct 2d enantiomers [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pcms](b ) ] .",
    "a notable feature of the pcms is their asymmetry in propagation of electromagnetic waves incident from opposite directions or having different ( right-  or  left - handed ) circular polarization .",
    "@xcite this directional asymmetry results from the fact that the wave propagating in the opposite direction effectively interacts with the mirror image of the original structure .",
    "therefore it is a manifestation of asymmetry between 2d enantiomers .",
    "this makes pcms distinct from 3d chiral metamaterials @xcite where 3d enantiomers do not flip when the wave propagation direction is reversed .    directional asymmetry is also known to exist in other environments such as the faraday cell . in this case , however , it is usually attributed to non - reciprocity due to the presence of magnetic field , while pcms do not have such non - reciprocity .",
    "further analysis reveals that both in faraday media and in optically active liquids the waves whose polarization state does not change during propagation ( polarization eigenstates ) are circularly polarized and _ counter - rotating _ ,",
    "i.e. , they come in pairs of eigenwaves one of which has right - handed ( rh ) and the other left - handed ( lh ) circular polarization .",
    "in contrast , pcms have polarization eigenstates that are elliptical and _ co - rotating _ , @xcite meaning that their handedness is the same for both eigenwaves in the pair .",
    "thus , while 3d chiral metamaterials are simply an analogy of bi - isotropic ( e.g. , optically active liquids ) or bianisotropic ( gyrotropic ) media , pcms clearly represent a distinct type of electromagnetic materials , apparently without an immediate naturally occurring counterpart . hence , explaining the exotic optical properties of pcms certainly poses an exciting problem in theoretical electrodynamics . on an abstract crystallographic level , it has been shown recently that a combination of birefringence and circular dichroism provides a basis for optical manifestation of planar chirality , and that an elliptically dichroic medium should exhibit characteristic optical properties of a pcm .",
    "@xcite    on a more involved , microscopic level , several explanations of pcm operation have been developed .",
    "most works attribute the dichroism to polarization - sensitive excitation of dark plasmonic resonant modes in meta - atoms . in a variety of pcm designs ,",
    "this polarization sensitivity is attributed to magnetic dipole excitations that become `` trapped '' due to poor coupling with the incident wave .",
    "@xcite other accounts @xcite build up on earlier multipole treatment of metamaterials @xcite to express the meta - atom s dichroic response based on collective dipole oscillations in its individual segments .",
    "still other works attempt to formulate the theory of pcms by treating the meta - atom as a plasmonic oligomer and calculating its response in coupled dipole approach.@xcite    however , an _ ab initio _ theoretical description of pcms , which would explain their dichroic behavior on a microscopic level and independently of a particular pcm geometry , is still missing .",
    "a first attempt , based on considering the response of the meta - atom in terms of the dynamics of individual electrons ( lorentz theory ) , was made in ref .  .",
    "that attempt , however , was only successful in arriving at the right form of the metamaterial s effective dielectric permittivity tensor , reproducing qualitatively correct optical properties of a pcm . a more rigorous , quantitative description with a detailed analysis of the applicability range for the lorentz theory is still called for .    in this paper , we make a further step towards an _ ab initio _ description of metamaterials and present a detailed route to arrive at the chiral properties for the asymmetric split - ring pcms.@xcite we start by considering the dynamics of free electrons in an arc - shaped metallic element in presence of an external electromagnetic wave .",
    "the electron motion is shown to be determined by ( i ) screening forces caused by the charge redistribution in the external field , and ( ii ) electromotive forces caused by currents flowing in the segment as the charges redistribute .",
    "these forces exert spring - like and inertia - like effects on an electron , respectively , and can be associated with capacitance - like and inductance - like contribution in an equivalent lc - circuit .",
    "together , these two kinds of forces give rise to a particle plasmon resonance .",
    "its properties are derived directly from geometric dimensions of the arc segment and material properties of the metal without the need for phenomenological parameters . by considering two such segments in close proximity , the electromagnetic response of a split - ring meta - atom",
    "is evaluated .    in order to connect the meta - atom s response to the exotic properties of pcms described previously ,",
    "a standard homogenization procedure @xcite is then employed to derive the effective dielectric permittivity tensor for the pcm . since the pcm in question is a surface rather than a bulk material,@xcite this procedure",
    "should not be regarded as a true homogenization , and a multipole - expansion approach should give a more accurate physical description .",
    "@xcite still , interpreting a metafilm as an effective medium can be feasible,@xcite and the resulting effective permittivity tensor is shown to be valid for normal incidence of light in the frequency range of the fundamental resonance of the split ring .",
    "moreover , it turns out to have the crystallographic structure of elliptically dichroic media , as would be expected for planar chiral materials .",
    "@xcite a similar approach was recently applied to calculate the thz field enhancement in a nanoslit,@xcite the results showing a good agreement with experiment.@xcite    the optical properties ( transmission and reflection spectra ) of the pcm are then calculated using wave operator based extension of standard transfer - matrix method .",
    "@xcite in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results , @xcite the spectra are sensitive to whether the incident wave has left- or right - handed circular polarization .",
    "this difference , which translates to directional asymmetry , @xcite can be used to quantify the strength of planar chiral properties .",
    "the dependence of this strength on the geometrical parameters of the split ring is analyzed .",
    "when the split ring is symmetric , i.e. , when there are no distinguishable 2d enantiomers , optical manifestation of planar chirality is seen to vanish as required by symmetry and reciprocity constraints .",
    "@xcite maximum chiral properties are observed when the enantiomers are most distinct .",
    "the proposed approach can be relatively straightforwardly extended to a wider variety of shapes for planar meta - atoms .",
    "moreover , the model lends itself to an extension along the lines of refs .   to the cases of oblique incidence and non - planar meta - atom shapes .",
    "the results obtained can also be generalized from a single pcm to pcm - based multilayers , inasmuch as such generalization can be performed.@xcite    the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "the lorentz theory is employed to arrive at the electromagnetic response of a single split - ring meta - atom .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] follows with the procedure to arrive at the effective permittivity tensor of the pcm .",
    "the structural properties of this tensor are analyzed , and calculation of the pcm s optical spectra is outlined . in section [ sec : comp ] , the results on calculated spectral properties of split - ring pcms are presented and compared with numerical simulations . in section [ sec : geom ] , the relations between chiral properties and meta - atom geometry are systematically analyzed .",
    "finally , section [ sec:5 ] summarizes the paper and outlines future extensions for the proposed theory .",
    "as an example of a planar chiral metamaterial , we consider a two - dimensional array of chiral split rings ( csrs ) . the corresponding meta - atom is shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "it comprises a metallic ring broken into two segments in an asymmetric fashion , so that two 2d enantiomers can be distinguished [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pcms](b ) ] .",
    "csr metamaterial was chosen for its relative geometrical simplicity and for availability of previous experimental results .",
    "@xcite    the lateral width of the ring @xmath0 is assumed to be much smaller than its radius @xmath1 , and its thickness @xmath2 is even smaller .",
    "the ring sits atop a thicker dielectric substrate .",
    "the metal of the ring is taken to be copper with complex dielectric permittivity @xmath3,@xcite and the permittivity of the substrate is @xmath4 .",
    "both materials are non - magnetic . a monochromatic incident wave with electric field @xmath5 is assumed to illuminate the material , @xmath6 being the angular frequency of the wave .",
    "we begin by considering the motion of an electron in a finite - sized metallic inclusion .",
    "each electron is affected by the driving force @xmath7 originating from the external electric field , the friction force @xmath8 due to losses in the metal , the screening force @xmath9 resulting from other electrons as they are redistributed in the inclusion by the external field , and the electromotive force @xmath10 due to currents produced by electrons as they move under the action of the field .",
    "here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are electron mass and charge , @xmath13 is its velocity , and @xmath14 is the decay frequency for the metal ( a friction coefficient for electrons ) . by determining the dynamics of the electrons in the metal and by averaging this dynamics over the meta - atom , its polarizability can be determined , and one can introduce effective dielectric parameters of the entire metamaterial .    it should be noted that averaging and homogenization are two distinct procedures . from the averaging of the microscopic parameters we get the average displacement of electrons and the overall polarizability of the metal ring segments . specifically , the averaging yields the resonance frequency and spectral shape .",
    "once the polarizability of the metal segments is known , the effective medium parameters can be introduced by homogenization . to be able to connect the properties of pcms with those of bulk planar chiral media , we employ the standard approaches used for bulk metamaterials .",
    "however , it should be realized that the resulting effective parameters can be attributed to the pcms under study only in specific cases ( for the normal incidence of light ) .",
    "the screening force @xmath9 is expected to depend heavily on the geometry of the metallic inclusion . under the action of the field ,",
    "all the electrons are displaced , and uncompensated charges are accumulated at the edges of the metal in the direction of the field .",
    "if the distance between the edges in that direction is small and the edges are wide enough , the induced charges produce the field similar to that inside a capacitor , i.e. it is mostly homogeneous and compensates the external field . therefore it can be assumed that the electrons simply wo nt move between such edges .",
    "so , for our geometry we can neglect out - of - plane and radial electron motion as long as @xmath0 and @xmath2 are small .    , where @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters are as in ref .",
    "( cell size : @xmath16 mm , ring radius : @xmath17 mm , ring width : @xmath18 mm , ring thickness : @xmath19 @xmath20 m , substrate thickness : @xmath21 mm , substrate material : dielectric with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the angles determining the csr composition are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . ]",
    "the displacement of an individual electron @xmath27 therefore depends on time and on the position in the ring : @xmath28 .",
    "it is subject to the equation of azimuthal motion for the electrons ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30    equation of motion introduces resonant features in the response of the structure .",
    "electrons are pushed by the external driving forces , which induce both electric currents in the ring and charges at the tips of the ring segments .",
    "the charges create a `` restoring force '' @xmath31 like the one in a harmonic oscillator ( e.g. , by hooke s law ) .",
    "the electromotive force @xmath32 caused by the current is the reason of the additional non - dynamic inertia of the electrons . as in the ordinary classical mechanics",
    ", a particle under these forces will be subject to resonant motion , which should manifest itself as resonant properties of the effective medium .",
    "usually , the electron displacement is small and in good accordance with the external field , so for a subwavelength - sized inclusion it can be considered as position - independent . in this case ,",
    "however , this behavior is expected to break down in the vicinity of a particle plasmon resonance where the electron shift can be substantial and more in accordance with the resonant mode .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 becomes very sensitive to the @xmath34-dependence . at the fundamental resonance",
    ", it is reasonable to assume the standing - wave positional dependence in the two ring segments @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 have the meaning of an averaged electron displacement in the corresponding segment .",
    "it is seen that the electrons do not move near the tips of the split rings as @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and maximally shift in the middle of the segments . while the positional dependence in @xmath27 can be safely neglected in the off - resonant situations , it will be shown below that it is required to correctly predict the resonant frequency of a csr .",
    "the effective response of the entire meta - atom is obtained by averaging over all available azimuthal angles where metal is present , i.e. , for @xmath34 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 and from @xmath42 to @xmath43 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] . with the brackets @xmath44 denoting the averaging of @xmath45 over @xmath34 , the equation of motion for the averaged electron displacement @xmath46 takes the form @xmath47 we assume that the metal is fully embedded into the substrate medium , so external field @xmath48 coincides with the field in the ambient medium @xmath49 .      since the accumulation of charges along",
    "the ring edges only serves to prevent the electron motion in the radial direction , the screening force @xmath50 inside the ring segment can be approximately described as the coulomb force generated by the charges at the tips of the segment , labeled by the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) . this assumption ( which is valid outside the immediate vicinity of the tips )",
    "is further substantiated by the fact that charges do accumulate mostly near the tips of metallic objects . in a csr",
    ", we need to take into account the tips of the other segment in the same split ring [ see fig . [",
    "fig:1](c ) ] , as well as the influence of the neighboring csrs .",
    "the screening force on electrons in a ring segment from its own tips is essentially similar to that in a metallic rod with width @xmath0 and thickness @xmath2 . for the rod placed in dielectric with @xmath51 ,",
    "the force is equal to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the surface charge density at the tip facet of the rod with area @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the distance from the center of the facet to an observation point .",
    "to avoid unphysical behavior of the force @xmath56 very close to the tip , the positional dependence of the displacement @xmath57 in eq .",
    "has to be taken into account as @xmath58 .",
    "the expression given by eq .   is approximately valid if @xmath55 is small enough so that the arc segment with length @xmath55 is not significantly different in shape from a rod with dimensions @xmath59 .",
    "it can be assumed so if the line connecting the observation point with the tip lies wholly within the metal , i.e. , if @xmath60 for @xmath61 .    outside of that range , eq",
    ".   no longer holds .",
    "however , for the observation point far away from the tips one can regard the charges accumulated at the tip as one point charge and calculate the screening force according to the coulomb law .",
    "unlike @xmath56 , the forces `` in the center '' of an arc segment ( labeled @xmath62 ) are not dominated by contribution from any particular tip , so both tips of the segment in question , as well as the tips of the neighboring segment in the ring and from the neighboring rings need to be taken into account . as a result , we get the following expression for the upper segment    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the position of a csr in the ( @xmath55 , @xmath65 ) plane , characterized by a couple of lattice indices @xmath66 and @xmath11 .",
    "the charge densities for the upper and lower segments are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .    to obtain the averaged screening force for the meta - atom",
    ", we assume that it is given by eq .   for @xmath60 ( i.e. , within an angle @xmath69 from each tip , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ) , and by eq .",
    "accordingly , the averaging over the upper segment results in the formula @xmath70 similar expressions can be obtained for the lower segment .",
    "these integrals can not be evaluated in closed form , but can be easily calculated numerically .",
    "the resulting screening force for the two segments in the ring can be finally expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 are coefficients obtained from the integrals in eq .  .",

    "the current @xmath87 in the metallic parts of the loop is @xmath88 .",
    "we then assign the magnetic field in the loop to be the magnetic field at the center of the split ring . the magnetic field created by the current in each segment",

    "the effective mass of an electron is dominated by the contribution of the electromotive force rather than by the dynamic counterpart .",

    ", it is seen that the proposed model coincides with a well - known effective - circuit ( lc ) model with the effective inductance and capacitance calculated from the material and geometrical properties of the csr .",
    "this result is not surprising because the lc model is expected to be valid for millimeter - sized resonators at the gigahertz operating frequencies .",
    "it also follows that the lc - model remains applicable as long as @xmath101 m@xmath102 .    in a csr , the coupling between the two segments",
    "is realized by means of the effective masses @xmath103 and @xmath104 and the `` stiffness '' coefficients @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "as we have just seen , all mass coefficients @xmath100 are almost identical .",
    "it is not the case for the coefficients @xmath107 , which contain the contribution in the vicinity of the tips @xmath108 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "this contribution is greater than the forces in the central part of the ring @xmath62 by about 10 times , so it can be considered dominant . on the contrary ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath109 contain only @xmath62 , so @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath111 , so the condition @xmath112 allows the contribution of @xmath109 to be entirely neglected .",
    "thus , we can simplify the expressions for the remaining stiffness coefficients @xmath107 : @xmath113 note that both tips for each segment are taken into account .",

    "it is important to realize two fundamental limitations of the presented homogenization approach .",

    "this can be safely done for the light normally incident onto a planar structure .",
    "indeed , the quadrupole moment @xmath155 has the form @xmath156 , where @xmath157 and the @xmath79-dependence in @xmath158 is caused by the external field .",
    "hence the quadrupole contribution has the form @xmath159 and is @xmath79-directed , resulting in a contribution to @xmath160 .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment is @xmath79-directed , too , since the electrons move in the ( @xmath55 , @xmath65)-plane , which results in effective magnetic permeability @xmath161 . therefore",
    ", these higher - moment contributions will not affect @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , which are the only components that will play a part in determining the normal - incidence transmission and reflection spectra .",
    "so it is sufficient to consider just the electric dipole moment , assuming @xmath162 for the pcm .",

    "become increasingly violated .",
    "this also causes a mismatch between analytically and numerically derived @xmath213 . on the other hand , for frequencies above @xmath213",
    "the agreement is worse because the numerical spectra are affected by higher - order csr resonances ( which are explicitly not accounted for in our determination of a csr s response ) , as well as the bragg resonances of the lattice , which are also neglected in our account under the assumption that the effective medium is regarded as homogeneous .",
    "[ fig : spectra](b ) shows the dependence of the analytical vs.  numerical spectra as @xmath210 is varied for the constant csr radius .",
    "it is seen that the agreement below @xmath213 is restored as @xmath210 increases , confirming our reasoning .",
    "however , the agreement above @xmath213 becomes much worse because the bragg resonances scale as @xmath214 , and are thus pushed into lower frequencies .",
    "physically it means that the upper frequency limit where @xmath215 ( and where the structure can be regarded as a metamaterial ) becomes smaller .",
    "ultimately @xmath216 moves past @xmath213 , which is where the response of an individual meta - atom becomes irrelevant to the whole optical properties of the structure .",
    "therefore as far as the quantitative agreement of @xmath217 is concerned , the model is found to be valid for the lattice period @xmath210 not exceeding 20 - 25 mm and for the csr radius @xmath1 significantly lower than @xmath210 .",
    "most discrepancies occur in higher frequencies ( @xmath218 ) and can be attributed to higher - order and/or lattice resonances which have been left out of consideration intentionally .",
    "the trade - off between split - ring coupling and grating diffraction is mentioned in the recent ref .  .",
    "good agreement within these validity limits of the model can also be confirmed in the spectra for the asymmetry @xmath219 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : spectradt](b ) ] .",
    "however , since such additional chiral response is spectrally well separated from the fundamental resonance that interests us , it does not affect planar chiral properties of csrs under present investigation .",

    "having established this , we move on to investigate how the spectrum @xmath222 behaves in various csr designs .",
    "a non - zero @xmath207 , signifying the presence of circular dichroism , carries special significance for 2d structures .",
    "one notices that spatial inversion of the whole system with respect to the plane normal to the metamaterial changes the handedness of the circular polarization ( lh @xmath223 rh ) , _ and _ replaces the structure with its enantiomeric counterpart ( see fig .",

    "furthermore , the reversal of the direction of incidence also transforms the structure into its enantiomeric counterpart but does _ not _ change the incident wave polarization . hence ,",
    "if the transmission spectra for the forward- vs.  backward - incident wave are labeled @xmath234 , respectively , then eq .",
    "results in @xmath235 again , for any structure at any frequency.@xcite therefore , a non - zero @xmath207 is a measure of the planar structure s directional asymmetry and its magnitude can be used as an indication of how strongly the planar chiral properties of a structure manifest themselves optically .",

    "consider first the displacement of one of the ring segments along the circle by varying @xmath243 and setting @xmath244 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",

    "not surprisingly , chiral properties are rather weak for @xmath245 and become larger as @xmath246 increases towards the case of fig .",

    ", however , @xmath207 decreases again , vanishing completely in the symmetric case @xmath249 .",
    "so the proposed theory confirms that both circular dichroism and directional asymmetry indeed vanish when mirror symmetry is present .    the spectral shape @xmath222 is seen to have a wider shape for small @xmath246 , becoming the narrowest for the optimal case and then diminishing without significantly changing its shape .",
    "this is what one would expect as the inter - segment coupling ( which is stronger for smaller @xmath246 because the tips are in close proximity ) pushes the particle plasmon resonances of a csr apart from each other .",
    "this feature is specific to csr design : while the response of each arc - shaped segment in a csr closely resembles that of a rod of equal length,@xcite the split ring is a geometry where the tips of the segments are in much closer proximity than for the rods placed at similar distance .",
    "hence , the field enhancement near the tips causes the response of the whole csr to depend strongly both on the individual segments and on inter - segment coupling .",
    "in addition , making @xmath246 small while maintaining the csr orientation should increase the contribution of extrinsic effects to chiral properties .",
    "@xcite this is indeed seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1a2](b ) , and this is likely the reason of a small but non - vanishing @xmath207 for these values .    displacing the ring segment past the symmetric case @xmath249",

    "fig : a1a2](a ) that @xmath207 changes its sign and that an exchange of @xmath239 results in the inversion of planar chiral properties ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "this entirely confirms the result expected from eq .  , taking into account that structures obtained by an exchange of @xmath243 and @xmath246 are 2d enantiomeric counterparts .",
    "we also examine csrs with variable length of the longer ring segment by varying @xmath243 and @xmath251 while keeping the other two angles constant ( note that all the time @xmath252 ) .",

    "the sign of @xmath207 changes when these two symmetric cases are traversed .",
    "the increase of the peak frequency @xmath213 corresponds to an increase in the stiffness coefficients @xmath256 as one of the segments becomes shorter , affected by a change in the coupling between the segments resonances as they differ in length more strongly . similarly varying the length of the shorter ring segment , i.e. , changing the angles @xmath243 and @xmath257 , the same behavior",
    "is observed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1b2](b ) .",
    "the spectral shape changes in the same manner as in the previous case , the peak in @xmath207 becoming broader for larger @xmath243 . however , this case is specific because @xmath258 , so there is only one symmetric shape ( @xmath259 , @xmath260 ) . because of this `` degeneracy '' , @xmath207 does not change sign when traversing the symmetric case .",
    "the same property can be responsible for higher peak values of @xmath221 .    finally , to determine how the chiral properties of pcms scale with the size of the meta - atoms , we investigate the dependence of @xmath207 on the ring radius @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] .",
    "the resonant frequency @xmath213 depends on the radius primarily due to @xmath261 appearing in the stiffness coefficients @xmath72 [ see eq .  ] .",

    "the resonance peak in @xmath222 broadens as @xmath1 increases .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a microscopic theoretical description of planar chiral metamaterials based on the electronic lorentz theory . using a chiral split - ring ( csr ) geometry@xcite as an example and considering the dynamics of individual free electrons , we arrive at expressions for electromagnetic response of a single split - ring meta - atom .",
    "its polarizability is derived analytically without phenomenological parameters .",
    "the effective dielectric permittivity tensor @xmath150 is then obtained from the single - atom response along the lines of standard homogenization techniques , @xcite to the extent that these techniques can be used at all to describe planar structures .",

    "@xcite in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results , @xcite the spectra show a difference with respect to whether the incident wave has left- or right - handed circular polarization [ @xmath206 ] .",
    "this difference , which translates to directional asymmetry , @xcite is shown to strongly depend on the geometrical parameters of the csr ( figs .",

    "whenever the split ring is symmetric , i.e. , when there are no distinguishable 2d enantiomers , optical manifestation of planar chirality is seen to vanish [ @xmath264 , and @xmath207 changes its sign when the structure is replaced with its enantiomeric counterpart [ fig .",
    "[ fig : a1a2](a ) ] .",
    "note that we have deliberately chosen the overall csr orientation in the lattice so as to focus on purely intrinsic chirality and to suppress extrinsic effects where possible .",
    "a detailed investigation of how intrinsic and extrinsic chiral properties interact in csr - based pcms warrants a separate investigation .",
    "while the specific split - ring geometry is chosen for its relative simplicity in analytical derivation , it should be understood that the proposed approach can be extended to any planar meta - atom consisting of thin wire - like metallic elements where transverse motion of electrons is restricted .",
    "the integrals in eqs .   and",
    "are likely to be more complicated and may have to be taken numerically .",
    "moreover , it may be particularly challenging to determine the correct charge density dependencies [ see eq .  ] and to identify the loops that contribute to the effective mass ; one may need to use equivalent lc - circuit or even resort to using data from direct numerical simulations if the geometry is particularly intricate .",
    "nevertheless , once the equations for the effective mass and stiffness coefficients for a particular unit cell geometry are established , parametric transformations of this geometry lend themselves to very easy semi - analytical treatment within the proposed framework .    furthermore ,",
    "oblique wave incidence and non - planar meta - atoms composed of similar thin elements are also tractable if the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are accounted for , giving rise to corrections in @xmath150 and introducing effective magnetic permeability tensor @xmath20 , as well as gyration pseudotensors responsible for magnetoelectric coupling or spatial dispersion .",
    "@xcite however , it still remains an open question whether such oblique - incidence treatment would be universal taking into account the inherent limitations of applying volume homogenization to surface structures .",
    "@xcite should such a generalization prove feasible , it is very interesting to extend the proposed approach from a single - layer pcm to pcm - based multilayers ( in the cases when such pcms can lend themselves to 3d homogenization @xcite ) and investigate its applicability as a planar metamaterial turns into a bulk one .",
