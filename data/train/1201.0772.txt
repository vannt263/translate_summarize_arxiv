    "below 858  k , magnetite , which may be written as fe@xmath2(fe@xmath3fe@xmath4)@xmath5o@xmath1 , is ferrimagnetically ordered , with the a and b sublattices having oppositely directed magnetizations .",
    "the moments of the five unpaired @xmath6 electrons of the tetrahedrally coordinated a - site fe@xmath4 ions are compensated by those of the octahedrally coordinated b - site fe@xmath4 ions .",
    "the net magnetization results from the octahedrally coordinated b - site fe@xmath3 that have four unpaired @xmath6 electrons @xcite . upon cooling , bulk magnetite undergoes a first - order phase transition from a moderately conducting high temperature state to a more insulating low temperature state at what is now called the verwey@xcite temperature , @xmath7  k. the change in electronic properties is coincident with a structural transition from a high temperature cubic inverse spinel to a low temperature monoclinic unit cell .",
    "the nature of the ordered insulating state remains an active topic of current research@xcite .",
    "experiments indicate the onset of multiferroicity@xcite in magnetite below 40  k@xcite , further highlighting the rich physics in this correlated system .",
    "recently , nanostructured electrodes have been used to apply strong electric fields in the plane of magnetite films@xcite .",
    "below @xmath8 , a sufficient applied voltage triggers a breakdown of the comparatively insulating low - temperature state and a sudden increase in conduction @xcite .",
    "this is an example of electric field - driven breakdown of a gapped state in strongly correlated oxides@xcite similar to landau - zener breakdown in classic semiconductors .",
    "the electric field - driven transition in magnetite is consistent with expectations@xcite based on such a mechanism ( via geometric scaling @xcite , lack of intrinsic hysteresis @xcite , changes of both contact and bulk resistance at the transition @xcite ) .",
    "these prior experiments examined films of various thicknesses , from 30  nm to 100  nm .",
    "no strong thickness dependence was observed in the switching properties , consistent with the applied lateral electric field at the sample surface acting as the driver of the breakdown ( though thinner films showed a less pronounced verwey transition in low - bias resistance vs. temperature measurements , consistent with expectations ) .",
    "here we report studies of the statistical variations of this electric field - driven transition in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 , as a function of temperature and magnetic field perpendicular to the film surface ( out - of - plane ) .",
    "we find that there is a statistical distribution of switching voltages , @xmath9 , that becomes more broad and shifts to higher voltages as @xmath10 is reduced .",
    "we discuss these trends in the context of switching kinetics in other systems that exhibit similar trends .",
    "the application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 film alters the @xmath9 , shifting the mean by several mv ( several percent ) and changing its shape , within a range of fields comparable to that required to reorient the magnetization out of plane .",

    "contact electrodes ( 2 nm adhesion layer of ti and 15 nm layer of au ) were patterned by e - beam lithography on the surface of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 film . as before @xcite , @xmath9 scales linearly with the channel length , @xmath14 ( the electrode spacing ) , implying an electric field - driven transition .",
    "long channels ( @xmath15 100  nm ) required large switching voltages that would alter the electrode geometry over numerous switching cycles , distorting the shape of @xmath9 histograms . to minimize @xmath9 , electrodes separated by 10 - 30",
    "nm were patterned using a self - aligned technique @xcite .",
    "electrical characterization of the devices was performed using a semiconductor parameter analyzer ( hp 4155a ) . to minimize self - heating when in the conducting state , the voltage was applied as pulses 500  @xmath16s in duration with a 5  ms period @xcite .",
    "the samples were cooled below @xmath8 with no magnetic field applied , and the distribution of @xmath9 was obtained by executing several thousand consecutive forward pulsed @xmath11-@xmath12 sweeps in the vicinity of the transition point ( typically a 0.2 - 0.3  v range ) at a fixed ( to within 50  mk ) temperature , and recording the number of switching events at each voltage .",
    "each voltage value is essentially an independent test to see if switching takes place under the pulse conditions .",
    "hence , some sweeps show one ( figure  [ fig1 ] a ) or several ( figure  [ fig1 ] b ) switching events . even if the system is switched to the conducting state at @xmath9(1 ) , it may return to the off state between pulses , and then switch to the on state at some higher voltage , @xmath9(2 ) , and so on . the @xmath9 distribution at a particular temperature is built by recording all switching events over several thousands ( 3000 - 6000 ) of @xmath11-@xmath12 cycles and then counting the number of switchings at a certain @xmath9 , to produce a `` # of counts '' vs. @xmath9 histogram .",
    "a typical @xmath9 distribution at 90k is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] d. the distribution is a single peak , symmetrical around the most probable @xmath9 value .",
    "this procedure was repeated at each temperature below @xmath8 ( @xmath17  110k for devices under test ; see figure  [ fig2]b inset ) , down to @xmath17 75  k. at @xmath18  k , the high values of @xmath9 necessary led to irreversible alteration of the electrode geometry , resulting in asymmetric , distorted @xmath9 histograms .",
    "near 80 - 90  k , @xmath11-@xmath12 cycles with multiple @xmath9 events ( figure  [ fig1]b ) were observed more frequently .",
    "thus , the total number of switching events observed varied with @xmath10 , even with a fixed number of @xmath11-@xmath12 cycles at each temperature . to compare @xmath9 distributions at different temperatures , the distributions were normalized , plotted as ( # of counts)/(max # of counts ) vs @xmath9 , where `` max # of counts '' is the number of events at the most probable @xmath9 and `` # of counts '' is the number of events at a certain @xmath9",
    ". figure  [ fig2]a is an example of normalized @xmath9 distributions in the 77  k-105  k temperature range .",
    "the measured widths of the @xmath9 distributions are not limited by temperature stability .    as has been discussed elsewhere@xcite ,",
    "the use of pulses is essential to minimize the role of self - heating once the system has been driven into the more conducting state .",
    "this self - heating and the short timescale@xcite required to raise the local temperature in the channel significantly makes it extremely challenging to determine directly whether the initial breakdown takesplace through the formation of a conducting filament or through a uniform switching ; once a highly conducting path is formed , the whole channel rapidly becomes conducting through self - heating .",
    "the filamentary picture is certainly likely , based on other breakdown phenomena in solids , and the statistical variation in @xmath9 is consistent with the idea of a process involving run - to - run variability associated with _",
    "details rather than global material properties , but this is not definitive .     distributions at different temperatures ( 77  k - 105  k ) .",
    "( b ) temperature dependence of the mean switching voltage , @xmath19 .",

    ", width=377 ]    the @xmath9 distribution at each temperature is characterized by two main parameters : the mean switching value @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total number of switching events ; and the width of distribution , calculated as a standard deviation : @xmath25 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath26 has the same @xmath10-dependence ( see figure  [ fig2 ] b ) as @xmath27 in single @xmath11-@xmath12 experiments described in previous publications @xcite .",
    "more interesting is the @xmath22 temperature dependence , showing broadening of the @xmath9 distribution as the temperature decreases ( figure  [ fig2 ] c ) .",
    "we note a deviation from monotonous temperature dependence of @xmath22 at 100  k , observed in several devices tested .",
    "this is a temperature well below @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig2]b inset ) , where several physical parameters ( resistance , heat capacity and magnetoresistance ) change abruptly .",
    "this increase in @xmath22 as temperature decreases is rather counter - intuitive .",
    "one might expect `` freezing '' of temperature fluctuations and decrease in thermal noise the temperature decreases and , thus , narrowing of @xmath9 distributions .",
    "the field - driven breakdown of the insulating state is an example of the `` escape - over - barrier '' problem , addressed generally by a.  garg @xcite .",
    "below @xmath8 , the ( temperature - dependent ) effective free energy of the electronic system is at a global minimum value in the insulating state , while the external electric field modifies the free energy landscape , lowering the free energy of another local minimum corresponding to the more conducting state . as the external field",
    "is increased beyond some critical value , the minimum corresponding to the more conducting state becomes the global minimum .",
    "the nonequilibrium transition to the conducting state then corresponds to some process that crosses the free energy barrier between these minima . at a sufficiently large value of the external field ,",
    "the free energy has only one minimum , corresponding to the conducting state .",
    "as garg showed , one may consider thermal activation over the free energy barrier as well as the possibility of quantum escape .",
    "this free energy picture predicts a broadening of the transition driving force ( @xmath9 here ) distribution as the absolute value of the driving force increases , consistent with our observations .",
    "this free energy picture has proven useful in studying other nonequilibrium transitions , such as magnetization reversal in nanoparticles @xcite and nanowires @xcite .",
    "pinning due to local disorder is one way to find increasing distribution widths as @xmath29 , as seen in investigations of field - driven magnetization reversal in nanowires @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , quantitative modeling in this framework requires several free parameters and is difficult without a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanism .",
    "qualitatively similar phenomenology ( distribution of switching thresholds that broadens as @xmath10 is decreased ) is also observed in the current - driven superconducting - normal transition in ultrathin nanowires@xcite . in this latter case as in ours , self - heating in the switched state is of critical importance , as is the temperature variation of the local thermal path .",
    "again , quantitative modeling using this self - heating approach would require the introduction of multiple parameters that are difficult to constrain experimentally , as well as detailed thermal modeling of the nanoscale local effective temperature distribution , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also examined the dependence of the switching distributions on applied out - of - plane magnetic field , @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath9 distributions ( 3000 cycles each ) were collected consecutively at 12 magnetic field values : 0  t ( first ) @xmath31 0.2  t @xmath31 0.4  t @xmath31 0.6  t @xmath31 0.8  t @xmath31 1  t @xmath31 2  t @xmath31 3  t @xmath31 4  t @xmath31 5  t @xmath31 6  t @xmath31 0  t(last ) .",
    "figure  [ vsw_h_dep ] a shows the resultant @xmath9 distributions at 80  k at several selected magnetic fields .",
    "as can be seen , magnetic field shifts the @xmath9 peak to higher @xmath12 values and narrows the @xmath9 distributions . to reassure that the observed @xmath32 shift is not from irreversible changes in the device , a control experiment returning to @xmath33  t was performed after experiments in all non - zero magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath9 distributions at @xmath33  t initially [ @xmath33  t ( first ) ] and in the end [ @xmath33  t ( last ) ] are identical ( see figure  [ vsw_h_dep ] a ) , meaning that observed changes in @xmath9 distributions ( shift and narrowing ) are indeed caused by the applied magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ vsw_h_dep ] b quantifies the dependence of @xmath32 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is clear that both parameters saturate as @xmath30 is increased beyond 1  t , _ i.e. _ ; further increases of @xmath30 up to 6  t have no significant effect .",
    "magnetic field of the opposite polarity ( not shown ) has exactly the same effect on the position and the width of @xmath9 distributions .",
    "note that the shape of the distribution , in particular its asymmetry about the peak value of @xmath9 , evolves nontrivially with magnetic field , becoming more symmetric in the high field limit .",
    "distributions at selected magnetic fields ( t=80  k).(b ) magnetic field dependence of the mean switching value , @xmath32 ( red squares ) , and the width of @xmath9 distributions , @xmath22 ( black circles).,width=321 ]    ) ( a ) and the magnetization ( @xmath34 ) ( b ) on the out - of - plane magnetic field applied.,width=302 ]    we consider whether this magnetic field dependence of the switching originates with some dependence of the bulk resistance or contact resistances , as this would alter the electric field distribution in the channel .",
    "since @xmath9 scales with the channel length , @xmath14 @xcite _ i.e. _ , as does the resistance of the channel ( @xmath35 ) , one might expect an _ increase _ in @xmath9 could result from an increase in the device resistance with applied magnetic field .",
    "however , fe@xmath36o@xmath37 has a negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) @xcite . figure  [ r_m_vs_h ] a shows an example of normalized resistance dependence , @xmath38 , on the out - of - plane magnetic field at 80  k. the resistance remains effectively unchanged up to @xmath170.4  t and then decreases as @xmath39 increases .",
    "thus , when @xmath32 and @xmath22 experience the predominance of their changes upon @xmath30 application ( @xmath40 , see figure  [ vsw_h_dep ] ) , the resistance of the device either stays constant or decreases . in the @xmath30 range when @xmath20 experiences significant changes ( see figure  [ r_m_vs_h ] a ) , @xmath32 and @xmath22 remain essentially unchanged ( figure  [ vsw_h_dep ] ) .",
    "therefore , the shift of @xmath32 in the presence of @xmath30 does not originate from the change in the resistance value of the device .",
    "another fe@xmath36o@xmath37 film parameter effected by @xmath30 is the magnetization of the film .",
    "figure  [ r_m_vs_h ] shows the normalized out - of - plane magnetization , @xmath34 , as a function of the out of plane @xmath30 , where @xmath41 is the magnetization of the film and @xmath42 is the saturated magnetization .",
    "this data is consistent with prior measurements on magnetite films@xcite while we do not know the microscopic arrangement of @xmath43 in the film in the absence of an external @xmath44 , magnetostatic energy considerations mean that @xmath43 under that condition lies in the plane of the film .",
    "the @xmath30 range over which @xmath41 is fully reoriented out of the plane ( up to 1  t ) matches the @xmath30 range of changes in the position of @xmath32 and @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ vsw_h_dep ] b ) .",
    "this suggests ( though does not prove ) that the switching kinetics parameters @xmath32 and @xmath45 , and therefore the stability of the gapped , low temperature , insulating state is tied the magnetization direction of magnetite films .",
    "this observation is intriguing because it is not clear how the nonequilibrium breakdown of the low temperature state would be coupled to the magnetization .",
    "possible factors include magnetoelastic effects such as magnetostriction@xcite ( @xmath17 parts in @xmath46 per tesla ) affecting the tunneling matrix element between @xmath47-site iron atoms ; and spin - orbit coupling playing a similar role@xcite .",
    "there have been reports of significant magnetoelectric and multiferroic effects in magnetite @xcite , and a recent calculation @xcite argues that these originate through the interplay of orbital ordering and on - site spin - orbit interactions of the b - site electrons . in this picture ,",
    "reorientation of the spin distorts the partially filled minority - spin orbitals occupied on the b - site ( formally ) fe@xmath3 ions .",
    "such a distortion would be a natural explanation for the observed correlation between @xmath43 and the kinetics of the electric field - driven breakdown of the ordered state , which directly involves the motions of those charge carriers .",
    "it is unclear how this kind of spin - orbit physics would explain the evolution of the @xmath9 distribution , however .",
    "it would also be worth considering whether there is any correlation between the characteristics of the switching distributions reported here , and the recently observed glassy relaxor ferroelectric relaxations in bulk magnetite crystals@xcite .",
    "additional , detailed experiments as a function of directionality of @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and crystallographic orientation should be able to test these alternatives . with the existing ( 100 ) films , studies of @xmath32 and @xmath45 as a function of @xmath30 in the plane as well as perpendicular to the plane should be able to access the tensorial form of the @xmath30 dependence .",
    "comparison with appropriately directed @xmath41 vs. @xmath30 data as a function of temperature would be a clear test of whether the observed agreement between @xmath30-field scales ( in @xmath9 and reorientation of @xmath43 is coincidental . further measurements on films grown with different crystallographic orientations would serve as a cross - check .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the acquisition of such data is very time intensive due to the need to acquire many thousands of switching events . in turn",
    ", there is a companion requirement of extremely good device stability , to avoid irreversible changes in the metal configuration over the thousands of switching cycles .",
    "we have studied the statistical distribution of the electric field needed for breakdown of the low temperature state of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of critical switching voltages moves to higher voltages and broadens , as @xmath10 is reduced .",
    "this broadening is consistent with phenomenology in other nonequilibrium experimental systems incorporating disorder and thermal runaway effects .",
    "the breakdown distributions are altered by modest external magnetic fields normal to the film , suggesting a need for further experiments to understand the connection between magnetization and breakdown of the correlated state .",
