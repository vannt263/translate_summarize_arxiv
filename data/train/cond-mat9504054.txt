    "the aggregation processes of small particles have attracted a great theoretical interest in the last decade @xcite , due to their wide range of applications . on can distinguish particle - cluster aggregation , whose prototype is the witten - sander model @xcite , and cluster - cluster aggregation @xcite . while the former model applies to field - induced growth processes , such as electrodeposition @xcite , dielectric breakdown @xcite , viscous fingering @xcite , etc ... , the latter explains true aggregation processes such as polymerisation @xcite , oil in water emulsions @xcite , soot particles in flames @xcite , flocculation of colloidal particles @xcite . among",
    "cluster - cluster aggregation processes one distinguishes diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( dlca ) @xcite and chemically - limited ( also called reaction - limited ) aggregation ( rlca ) @xcite which correspond respectively to fast ( fully screened ) and slow ( partially screened ) aggregation of colloids @xcite .",
    "the cca processes leads to a flocculation regime when the concentration is smaller than a characteristic gel concentration @xmath8 , and to a gelation regime otherwise . in flocculation regime",
    "it remains a single fractal cluster at the end of the aggregation process with a fractal dimension @xmath9 equal to 1.45 in dlca case ( and 1.65 in rlca case ) . in the gelation regime",
    "it appears an `` infinite '' cluster at a given time @xmath0 ( hereafter refered as the gelling cluster ) .",
    "when working with a finite ( but large ) box , such a cluster is usually defined as touching the box from edge to edge as in the percolation theory @xcite . since both physical problems are quite similar , it is tempting to explain the infinite cluster formation in dlca by the percolation theory which excludes all dynamical phenomena and this has been done by several authors @xcite .",
    "the fractal dimension of the infinite cluster of dlca has been found to be different than the one of percolation @xcite and it has been argued that this discrepancy is due to dynamical effects .",
    "however , recent aggregation experiments @xcite on attractive coagulated particles suggest that percolation transition occurs at the particle concentration 0.42 . therefore the question is still open :",
    "are cca models and percolation theory compatible ?    in this paper",
    "we show that the infinite cluster obtained at @xmath0 in cca models exhibits a crossover length @xmath1 between percolation and aggregation , for concentration values @xmath4 larger than the gel concentration @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we show that @xmath1 vanishes when increasing @xmath4 , and for @xmath10 the percolation regime shows up at all length scales in the infinite cluster .",
    "these results suggest that cca processes can be viewed as an irreversible percolation phenomenom , as the invasion percolation model without trapping @xcite and the model for a diffusion front@xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation model consists in a monte carlo algorithm which builds clusters on a lattice within a square box of edge length @xmath11 .",
    "initially particles are distributed randomly ( but uniformily in the space ) on the lattice sites up to volume fraction ( concentration ) @xmath4 . in order to insure that the diffusion coefficient of the clusters varies as the inverse of their radius @xmath12 , a particle ( or a cluster )",
    "is chosen randomly according to a probability : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( = @xmath15 ) is the kinetical exponent .",
    "then the cluster performs a translational motion by one unit ( taking account periodic boundary conditions , pbc ) in any of the four directions @xmath16 chosen at random .",
    "if the cluster does not collide with another , the displacement is performed and the algorithm goes on by choosing again another cluster . if a collision occurs between two clusters they stick together forming a new large cluster . in our simulation",
    "we have considered that collision occurs when a particle of a cluster tries to occupy a particle of another cluster . in that case",
    "the cluster is not displaced but a bond is established between the two contacting particles . if there are more than one collision at a given motion , only one bond is chosen at random .",
    "this trick has used by kolb in a reversible diffusion - limited cluster aggregation model @xcite .",
    "this important variant implies that there are no loops ( as in off - lattice dlca @xcite ) and that there is no intrinsic percolation at the begining of the process : the intitial concentration can be varied up to unity .    for concentrations larger than @xmath8",
    "there exists a gel time @xmath0 where a cluster becomes infinite .",
    "this gelling cluster is stored for a numerical analysis , and to compare , we leave the aggregation process continuing up to the time where it remains only one cluster ( hereafter refered as the final cluster ) . in the case of reaction",
    "limited cluster - cluster aggregation @xcite , in addition to the algorithm described above , it is introduced a sticking probabilty @xmath17 . after a collision a new bond is created only if a random number ( uniformly distributed between zero and one ) is smaller than @xmath18 . here ,",
    "we have performed two - dimensional simulations in boxes of different sizes up to @xmath19 240 .",
    "typical results that compare qualitatevely the resulting morphologies of the gelling cluster ( g ) and the final cluster ( f ) in dlca are are illustrated in figure 1 . in the case of the gelling cluster",
    "the other remaining clusters have been discarded and therefore are not shown .",
    "note that the morphology of the cluster shown in figure 1a is strongly reminiscent of that of a percolating cluster as obtained in standard percolation theory @xcite when occupying randomly the sites of a square lattice with the percolation probability @xmath20 . to make quantitative comparaisons between g and f , we have calculated the mass @xmath21 dependent box size @xmath22 using the mass - counting algorithm @xcite . in figure 2",
    "we show the log - log plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath22 for the same concentration than those considered in figure 1 .",
    "the resulting slope indicates that m scales as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , for g ( open circles ) and f ( black squares ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 ( = 1.89 ) is close to the fractal dimension of the percolating cluster in two dimensions , and @xmath26(=2 ) is the spatial dimension .",
    "if the mass of the gelling cluster g or the mass of the final cluster f scales as @xmath27 we might be tempted to conclude that the quantity @xmath28 should not depend on @xmath22 . to test this we show , in figure 3 , the curves giving @xmath29 as a function of @xmath22 . figures 3a and 3c corresponds to g for @xmath30 and d = d , respectively and figures 3b and 3d correspond to f for @xmath30 and d = d , respectively .",
    "one observes on these figures that @xmath29 is independent on @xmath22 only in cases 3a and 3d and for sufficiently large concentrations , confirming our first guess of different fractal dimensions , 1.89 and 2.00 , for g and f respectively .",
    "figures 3b and 3c are shown here as conter - examples to illustrate the high precisions on these estimates for the fractal dimensions .",
    "in general , i.e. for not too large concentrations , one can define a @xmath4-dependent crossover length @xmath1 such that @xmath29 becomes independent on @xmath22 only for @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , another linear regime",
    "is observed , which is better extended at very low concentration , with a slope of about -0.4 and -0.5 in cases 3a and 3d , respectively , corresponding to the fractal dimension @xmath31 , close to the one of dlca clusters .",
    "therefore @xmath1 defines a change of scaling regime between dlca for short lengths and either percolation ( g ) or homogeneity ( f ) for large lengths .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 should be proportional to the characteristic length correlation @xmath32 ( or average size ) of dlca fractal aggregates @xcite .",
    "note that in all cases @xmath1 vanishes for @xmath10 , and this is the reason of the absence of crossover in the curves reported in figure 2 .",
    "when estimating the fractal dimension of the aggregates @xmath33 in the range of lengths corresponding to the aggregation regime ( @xmath3 ) , we found , in both cases g and f , that it increases significantly with concentration ( the data are reported in figure 4 ) .",
    "those results confirm previous conclusions in two dimensions @xcite as well as in three dimensions @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath1 can not be annalysed as a simple scaling relation .",
    "moreover , the discrete values of @xmath22 that require mass - counting calculations , and finite size effects , impedes us to determine @xmath1 within a sufficiently small range of error . anyway , all the results depicted in figs . 2 and 3 suggest that , at least for @xmath2 the mass of the gelling cluster g scales with @xmath22 as a standard percolation cluster .",
    "however such results are not sufficient to insure that their morphologies are the same .",
    "it is well known that there exist additional quantities ( different and independent on the fractal dimension ) to characterize a percolating cluster . in principle , the morphology is entirely characterized by an infinite set of exponents @xcite , but here we shall focuse on two particular exponents : the fractal dimensions of the `` backbone '' @xmath34 and the fractal dimension of the `` links '' @xcite . the backbone of a cluster is the ensemble which remains after removing dead - ends ( or dangling - ends ) . for a percolating cluster in two dimension the fractal dimension of the backbone @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "the links ( also called red bonds ) are the sites of the cluster that are singly connected , that is , if we take out a link the connection between the entire cluster is broken . for a percolating cluster in two dimensions the fractal dimension of links",
    "@xmath37 is equal to 0.75 .    in order to identify the backbone and the links of a given cluster ,",
    "we have been obliged ( due to the pbc considered in the cca simulations ) to span the cluster out of the box , taking account of pbc .",
    "then , we have applied to the new cluster configuration ( with size larger than the box size @xmath11 , in almost all situations ) a procedure suggested by hermann et al .",
    "@xcite to identify the backbone and the links . finally , the resulting backbone ( and links ) is unspanned and returned inside the original box . in figures 1 ,",
    "the sites depicted with strong grey and black colors denotes the backbone and the links , repectively .",
    "we have calculated the fractal dimension of the backbone @xmath35 for both g and f clusters and different concentration values .",
    "the results are depicted in figure 5 for two box sizes length @xmath11 = 90 ( black symbols ) and 120 ( open symbols ) .",
    "note that for small concentration values the @xmath35 values , for both g and f clusters , are quite similar .",
    "this can be understood , since , as mentioned above , the fractal dimension in the aggregation regime is almost the same in both cases .",
    "this conclusion is more convincing for @xmath38 , but for larger @xmath4 values , @xmath35 of the gelling cluster g becomes smaller than @xmath35 of the final cluster f. furthermore , in the g case , @xmath35 reaches the value 1.61 ( the same value than for a percolating cluster ) for @xmath10 . for @xmath39 , @xmath35 saturates to 1.89 ( the value of the fractal dimension of a percolating cluster ) . in the f case ,",
    "the same kind of saturation phenomenon occurs but , for @xmath39 , @xmath35 saturates to the spatial dimension @xmath26 .",
    "the increasing value of @xmath35 suggests that the backbone structure is mainly reflecting the fractal aggregate structure ( which also increases with concentration as shown in figure 4 ) .",
    "it is only when the crossover length @xmath1 vanishes that the backbone structure becomes characteristic of the one of a percolating cluster , since @xmath35 varies from 1.61 to 1.89 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "in figure 6 it is shown that for @xmath4 smaller than about 0.5 , the fractal dimension @xmath37 of the links is approximately equal to 1 , suggesting that the mass of the links scales with @xmath22 in a trivial manner . however , for @xmath10 , @xmath37 reaches the value 0.75 as in a percolating cluster .",
    "the @xmath37 undependence on the box size @xmath11 suggests that there exist a threshold concentration , close to @xmath40 where the entire g cluster scales exactly as a percolating cluster .",
    "when @xmath4 is increased above this threshold , @xmath37 vanishes , similarly to the percolation theory when the occupation probability @xmath18 is increased above @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the vanishing links in the gelling cluster for large @xmath4 values suggest that , at very small scales , the system becomes homogeneous , even if , at large distances , the system scales as a percolating cluster as shown in figure 3 .    in order to appreciate the degree of generality of our results , we have also performed some calculations in the reaction - limited case ( rlca ) . in figure 7",
    "we have reported the @xmath42 curves and it can be shown that they exhibit the same qualitative behavior than in the dlca case ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the percolation scaling could exist in other kinds of cca processes such as the ballistic - limited @xcite , the convection - limited @xcite and the fluctuating bond @xcite aggregation models .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the infinite cluster obtained at the gel time @xmath0 in cca models exhibits a crossover length @xmath1 between aggregation and percolation .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 vanishes at a critical concentration @xmath43 where the mass of the entire system ( and its backbone and links ) scales as for a percolating cluster obtained at @xmath41 . for @xmath7",
    "the percolation regime persists at least at large scales , because the vanishing links suggest that an homogeneous regime apperas at small scales .",
    "the value obtained here for @xmath5 is close to the value reported in the above mentioned experimental work @xcite ( @xmath44 ) , but typical statistical fluctuations to determine a critical value impedes us to insure if there are some relation between these two critical probabilities .",
    "it might also be worth finding a relation between @xmath5 and the critical probability of the site percolation threshold ( @xmath20 ) on a square lattice .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that close to @xmath5 the fractal dimension of the links @xmath37 becomes equal to that of the percolating clusters suggests that the critical behavior in both cases are the same , since the correlation lenght exponent @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations on a cubic lattice suggest that the results reported here are quite general and extend in three dimensions .",
    "one of us ( a. h. ) would like to acknowledge support from conicit ( venezuela ) .",
    "the numerical calculations where done on the computers of the cnusc ( centre universitaire sud de calcul ) , montpellier , france , with support from cnrs ."
