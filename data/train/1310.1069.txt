    "long time ago it has been proposed  @xcite that strangeness is easier produced in the qgp than in a hadronic environment . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "new results on strangeness production  @xcite are being obtained , among them are the transverse momentum distributions for pions , kaons , protons and @xmath1 as well as baryon to meson ratios .",
    "the distributions show disagreement with perturbative qcd results , especially on the strangeness sector .",
    "consequently , the baryon to meson ratio presents an unexplained behavior at intermediate transverse momenta .",
    "the baryon to meson ratios measured at lhc energies could be different from the ratios measured at lower energies , since the former are driven predominantly by hard collisions .",
    "many ideas have been developed to understand these ratios .",
    "some studies include the percolation model  @xcite , recombination  @xcite , the statistical model  @xcite , and also flow  @xcite in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the slight discrepancies of the statistical model with data provide the motivation to get further insight into the hadronization mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this work reports on an alternative model to study the production of hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions , where the evolving density during the collision and the strangeness abundance are key ingredients , the so called _ dynamical quark recombination model _  @xcite .",

    "the combinatorial analysis allows to estimate in a simple way the number of possible colorless baryons and mesons , when we take a certain number of heavy ( @xmath11 ) and light ( @xmath12 ) quarks . considering the case where one starts out with a set of @xmath13 @xmath12-quarks ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 @xmath11-quarks ( @xmath16 ) , it is possible to form sets of two ( mesons ) or tree ( baryons ) quarks .",
