    "bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) , between identical bosons , have been extensively studied in hadronic final states produced in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , hadron - hadron and heavy - ion interactions @xcite .",
    "the bosons studied are mainly charged pions @xcite . only rarely have neutral pions been studied @xcite , and never before in @xmath2 interactions . in this letter",
    ", we report a study of bec of @xmath4 pairs in hadronic decays of the @xmath0 boson at lep , and compare them to bec of pairs of identically charged pions .",
    "bec manifest themselves as an enhanced production of pairs of identical bosons which are close to one another in phase space .",
    "this can be studied in terms of the two - particle correlation function @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the two - particle number density for identical bosons with four - momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 , subject to bose - einstein symmetry .",
    "the reference distribution , @xmath10 , is the same density in the absence of bose - einstein symmetry .    assuming a static spherical boson source with a gaussian density and a plane wave description of the bosons , @xmath11 is written as @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the square of the four - momentum difference .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 can be interpreted as the size of the boson source in the centre - of - mass system of the boson pair and a measurement of the correlation function @xmath5 gives access to the source size .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is introduced to describe the fraction of effectively interfering pion pairs . in this analysis",
    "the normalization factor @xmath16 is added .",
    "it takes into account possible long - range momentum correlations , as well as possible differences in pion multiplicity in the data and reference samples , over the four - momentum difference range studied .",
    "the spherical shape of the boson source assumed here is a simplified picture .",
    "high statistics charged pion data at lep revealed the source to be elongated @xcite .",
    "the present measurement has , however , no sensitivity to the shape of the source of neutral pions , due to its limited statistics .",
    "several theoretical predictions exist for differences in bec for pairs of bosons in the pion isospin triplet ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath4 ) . from the string model @xcite a smaller spatial emission region , _",
    "i.e. _  a wider momentum correlation distribution is expected for @xmath4@xmath4 , than for @xmath19@xmath19 .",
    "this follows from the break - up of the string into @xmath20 pairs , which forbids two equally charged pions to lie next to each other on the string , whereas two neutral pions can .",
    "the same effect is found when the probabilistic string break - up rule is interpreted as the square of a quantum mechanical amplitude @xcite . from a quantum statistical approach to bose - einstein symmetry @xcite , a small difference between @xmath19@xmath19 and @xmath4@xmath4 correlation is expected .",
    "the size and shape of this difference is predicted to be similar to an expected bose - einstein correlation of @xmath19@xmath21 pairs .",
    "it is theoretically uncertain whether bec between unlike sign pions are also to be expected on the ground of isospin invariance @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to measure the difference in size of the emission region of neutral and charged pions . in order to minimize systematic uncertainties on this difference",
    ", the procedures followed for the charged pions are kept as close as possible to those for the neutral pions .",
    "for this analysis , data collected with the l3 detector @xcite during the 1994 and 1995 lep runs are used .",
    "the analysis is based mainly on measurements from the high resolution electromagnetic calorimeter and from the central tracking device .",
    "the data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath22 at centre - of - mass energies around @xmath23 . from this sample ,",
    "about 2 million hadronic events are selected , using energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters @xcite .    the jetset generator @xcite is used to study the detector response to hadronic events",
    ". parameters of the generator are tuned to give a good description of event and jet shapes of hadronic events measured in l3 .",
    "the effects of bose - einstein symmetry are simulated with the ` luboei ` routine @xcite .",
    "the routine has two parameters , which have been chosen to obtain a reasonable description of l3 data .",
    "this _ ad - hoc _ model shifts boson momenta after the hadronization phase in such a way that the correlation function @xmath24 for identical bosons is proportional to a constant plus a gaussian as in equation  [ eq : c_gausexp ] .",
    "the generated events are passed through a full detector simulation @xcite and are reconstructed and subjected to the same analysis procedure as the data .",
    "this monte carlo sample ( jetset - be ) contains about 7 million events . a control sample ( jetset - nobe ) is also generated with jetset but it has ` luboei ` switched off and the generator parameters retuned .",
    "significant differences are found in the tuned parameters in the two cases .",
    "the number of events in the control sample is approximately 2 million .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the jetset - be sample is used throughout this letter .",
    "neutral pions in hadronic events are reconstructed from photon pairs .",
    "photon candidates are identified in the electromagnetic calorimeter as a cluster of at least two adjacent crystals .",
    "the clusters are required to be located in the central region of the detector , @xmath25 , and to be in the energy range @xmath26 .",
    "above 6 , the two photons from a @xmath4 decay can no longer be distinguished as two separate clusters .",
    "discrimination of clusters originating from photons or electrons from those due to other particles is based on the distribution of the energy over the crystals of the cluster .",
    "a good photon discrimination is achieved with a neural network based on this energy distribution @xcite . to reject clusters due to charged particles ,",
    "a minimum distance between the cluster and the extrapolation of the closest track of 30 is required .",
    "this corresponds to 1.5 times the size of the front face of a crystal .",
    "pairs of photon candidates within an event are used to reconstruct @xmath4 s .",
    "the distribution of invariant mass of photon pairs shows a peak around the @xmath4 mass , above a smooth background .",
    "these two components are extracted by a fit to the mass spectrum .",
    "the background is described by a chebyshev polynomial of third order , @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath4 peak is parameterized by a gaussian function with exponential tails , which is continuous , and smooth in the first derivative : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the two - photon invariant mass , @xmath30 indicates the peak position , and @xmath31 is the width of the gaussian peak .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 determine the values of @xmath29 where the gaussian changes into an exponential .",
    "the exponential tail at low mass is needed to describe the presence of converted photons in cluster pairs .",
    "if a photon converts , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the outer wall of the tracker , it can still be selected as a photon , although some of the original photon energy is lost .",
    "the high mass tail accounts for an overestimate of the cluster energy due to another cluster nearby .",
    "an example of the fit result is given in figure  [ fig : minv1d ] .",
    "the sum of the two functions @xmath27 and @xmath34 describes the distribution well .",
    "also , the shape and the size of the @xmath4 peak in the data and monte carlo agree .",
    "the mass resolution as determined from the fit is about @xmath35 .    the photon pair is then selected as a @xmath4 candidate if it has an energy @xmath36 . for a mass window @xmath37 ,",
    "a total of @xmath38 million @xmath4 s is selected in data .",
    "the @xmath4 purity of the candidate sample is of the order of @xmath39 and the @xmath4 selection efficiency is approximately @xmath40 . about half of the background",
    "is combinatorial , _ i.e. _ , photons from different @xmath4 s .",
    "the other half consists of pairs where one or both of the photons do not come from a @xmath4 decay .",
    "charged pions are detected as tracks in the central tracker .",
    "they are selected in the same kinematic range as neutral pions : @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where the energy is calculated from the track momentum , assuming the @xmath19 mass . in addition , at least 35 out of 62 possible wire hits are required in the track fit , and the number of wires between the first and the last must be at least 50 . furthermore , the track must have at least one hit in the inner part of the tracker , and the distance of closest approach to the @xmath2 vertex in the plane transverse to the beam is required to be less than 5 .",
    "finally a high resolution measurement of the polar angle is demanded .",
    "charged pions are analyzed in the 1995 data only , in which @xmath43 million tracks are selected .",
    "after the neutral pion selection , @xmath4 candidates within an event are paired , requiring that no cluster is common to the two candidates , and their four - momentum difference @xmath44 is calculated .",
    "the @xmath4@xmath4 component of the @xmath44 distribution is estimated by a fit to the two - dimensional mass spectrum for every bin in @xmath44 .",
    "an example of these mass distributions is shown in figure  [ fig : minv2d]a , for the bin @xmath45 .",
    "the various contributions are clearly visible : non-@xmath4 pairs give the smooth background , @xmath4 with non-@xmath4 pairs give the two `` ridges '' in the @xmath4 peak regions , @xmath4 pairs give part of the peak in the centre of the plot , the other part being caused by the sum of the @xmath4 with non-@xmath4 ridges .",
    "this two - dimensional distribution is derived from the product of two one - dimensional mass distributions @xcite : @xmath46 \\\\    & + { \\ensuremath{a_{\\text{bgbg}}{\\ensuremath{f_{\\text{bgbg}}}}}}{(m_1,m_2 ) } , \\label{eq : f2d } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the first term describes the @xmath4@xmath4 part , the second term describes the @xmath4 with non-@xmath4 pair ridges and the third term is the non-@xmath4 pair background .",
    "the number of @xmath4 pairs in the mass window @xmath47 is related to the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the functions @xmath34 and @xmath27 have the same functional form as described before , @xmath49 follows from the product of two chebyshev polynomials of third order and is required to be symmetric in the two masses .",
    "all 18 parameters of @xmath50 are left free in the fit .",
    "the result of a binned maximum likelihood fit for the mass distribution in figure  [ fig : minv2d]a is shown in figures  [ fig : minv2d]b  d . in this representative example , the @xmath51 is 4737 for 4606 degrees of freedom , which corresponds to a @xmath52 confidence level .    figure  [ fig : pionpair_q]a presents the @xmath44 distribution for @xmath4 pairs in the mass window @xmath47 , obtained from the values of the parameter @xmath48 from two - dimensional mass fits of equation  [ eq : f2d ] to both data and monte carlo .",
    "some deviations between data and monte carlo are caused by the imperfect modeling of bec .",
    "the efficiency to select a @xmath4 pair in an event ranges from about @xmath53 at @xmath54 to @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "bins in @xmath44 below 300 are not used for the rest of the analysis for two reasons .",
    "first , the efficiency estimate depends strongly on the bec modeling in the generator , in the region of small @xmath44 .",
    "this occurs because the bec modeling moves identical pions closer together , which lowers the detection efficiency .",
    "secondly , the four - momentum difference of any pair of @xmath4 s from @xmath57 decays is kinematically constrained to have @xmath58 , and in that @xmath44-range , more than @xmath59 of all @xmath4 pairs originate from this decay .",
    "a rejection of the small @xmath44 region thus avoids systematic uncertainties due to the simulation of the @xmath60 multiplicity .",
    "the distribution of four - momentum difference of equally charged pion pairs is obtained by calculating @xmath44 for pairs of tracks selected within an event and with the same charge .",
    "this raw @xmath19@xmath19 spectrum is corrected bin - by - bin for both pion purity and efficiency using the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the uncorrected distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : pionpair_q]b .",
    "compared to the @xmath4@xmath4 case , smaller deviations are observed between the raw spectrum in data and monte carlo .",
    "these deviations are due to the imperfect modeling of bec in the monte carlo .",
    "to obtain the final correlation function @xmath24 , the @xmath44 distribution of @xmath4 pairs in the data , figure  [ fig : pionpair_q]a , is corrected for selection efficiencies .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the number of selected @xmath4 pairs in monte carlo events ( jetset - be ) divided by the number of generated @xmath4 pairs in the same events , where the generated pions have to be in the same kinematic range as the selected pions .",
    "this definition includes an acceptance correction for those @xmath4 s which can not be selected kinematically . in this way",
    ", the correlations of @xmath4 pairs can directly be compared to those of charged pion pairs .",
    "the reference distribution @xmath61 is calculated from a jetset - nobe  sample at generator level , where pions are taken in the same kinematic range as in the definition of the selection efficiency .",
    "we choose this reference distribution rather than the distribution for @xmath19@xmath21 because of the uncertainty concerning bec between unlike sign pions mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the correlation distribution @xmath24 is then the ratio of the corrected data spectrum to the reference spectrum .",
    "the distribution of @xmath24 is displayed in figure  [ fig : pion_be]a .",
    "an enhancement at low @xmath44 values , expected from bose - einstein symmetry , is clearly visible .",
    "the function @xmath24 from equation  [ eq : c_gausexp ] is fitted to this ratio in the interval @xmath62 . extending the fit to lower values of @xmath44 results in consistent values of the parameters but with much larger systematic uncertainties .",
    "the overall normalization @xmath63 is determined from the integrals of @xmath24 and the fit function ; the only free parameters are @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath32 . in this fit",
    ", the @xmath51 is 46.1 for 40 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a @xmath64 confidence level .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the result due to the @xmath4 selection is determined by varying the photon selection cuts and by changing the size of the @xmath4 mass window by @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath4@xmath4 mass fit of equation  [ eq : f2d ] is tested by varying the fit range by @xmath66 .",
    "the uncertainty due to the modeling of bose - einstein correlations in the monte carlo generator is taken into account by using the control sample jetset - nobe in the efficiency correction procedure .",
    "in addition , the influence on the final result of the agreement between data and monte carlo of distributions relevant to the photon and @xmath4 selection , such as neural network output and energy and polar angle of @xmath4 s , is studied .",
    "finally , the binning in @xmath44 is varied . the systematic uncertainty on the result due to each of the sources ,",
    "is assigned as half the maximum deviation .",
    "a summary is given in table  [ tab : pi0syst ] .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is calculated as the quadratic sum of these uncertainties .",
    "the final correlation function @xmath24 for @xmath19@xmath19 is calculated in a similar way as that for @xmath4@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath19@xmath19 data distribution , figure  [ fig : pionpair_q]b , is corrected for purity and efficiency . as for @xmath4@xmath4 ,",
    "the efficiency is calculated for generated pions in the same kinematic range as the selected pions .",
    "the reference distribution @xmath61 and the correlation distribution @xmath24 are obtained in the same way as for @xmath4@xmath4 .",
    "the correlation function for @xmath19@xmath19 is shown in figure  [ fig : pion_be]b . due to the higher selection efficiency for charged pions as compared to neutral pions , the significance of the low @xmath44 value enhancement is much larger . as for @xmath4@xmath4 , the function defined in equation  [ eq : c_gausexp ]",
    "is fitted to the final distribution . in this fit",
    ", the @xmath51 is 42.6 for 40 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a @xmath67 confidence level .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the result due to the track selection is determined by varying the requirements on number of hits , distance of closest approach and polar angle determination . as in the @xmath4@xmath4 case",
    ", the uncertainty on the modeling of bose - einstein correlations in the monte carlo generator is obtained by using the control sample jetset - nobe in the analysis .",
    "finally , the binning in @xmath44 is varied .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are attributed as in the @xmath4@xmath4 case , and are summarized in table  [ tab : cpisyst ] . the total systematic uncertainty is calculated as the quadratic sum of these uncertainties .",
    "the final values for the strength of the correlation @xmath15 and the corresponding radii of the boson sources @xmath14 are given in table  [ tab : final ] .",
    "due to the lower efficiency of the @xmath4@xmath4 selection , the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath4@xmath4 result is larger than the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath19@xmath19 result . within these uncertainties ,",
    "the data indicate both a weaker correlation and a smaller source radius for @xmath4@xmath4 .",
    "the weakness of the @xmath4@xmath4 correlation can be partly explained by the bigger contribution of resonance decays to the @xmath44 spectrum .",
    "the difference of the source sizes is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 indicate the value of @xmath14 for @xmath19@xmath19 and @xmath4@xmath4 , respectively . in this difference",
    ", the systematic uncertainties due to the modeling of bose - einstein correlations and the binning in @xmath44 are taken to be correlated between the two samples .",
    "the smaller radius found for @xmath4@xmath4 is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the string model .",
    "we wish to express our gratitude to the cern accelerator divisions for the excellent performance of the lep machine .",
    "we acknowledge the contributions of the engineers and technicians who have participated in the construction and maintenance of this experiment .",
