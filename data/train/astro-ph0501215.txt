    "x - ray binaries show x - ray flux variations in a broad range of time scales ( fig.[fig : pds_cygx2 ] ) .",
    "their power density spectra often reveal a number of periodic and quasi - periodic phenomena , corresponding to the orbital frequency of the binary system , the spin frequency of the neutron star and quasi - periodic oscillation , which nature is still poorly understood .",
    "in addition , aperiodic variability is observed , giving rise to the broad band continuum component in power density spectra , extending from @xmath15 msec to the longest time scales accessible for monitoring instruments .",
    "the aperiodic variability is often characterized by the fractional rms values of @xmath16 tens of per cent , indicating that variations of the mass accretion rate @xmath2 in the broad range of time scales are present in the innermost region of the accretion flow , where x - ray emission is produced . from the point of view of characteristic time scales , the high frequency variations",
    "could potentially be produced in the vicinity of the compact object .",
    "longer time scales , on the contrary , exceed by many orders of magnitude the characteristic time scales in the region of the main energy release .",
    "hence , the low frequency @xmath2 variations have to be generated in the outer parts of the accretion flow and to be propagated to the region of the main energy release . due to the diffusive nature of the standard shakura - sunyaev disk @xcite",
    ", it plays the role of the low - pass filter , at any given radius @xmath17 suppressing @xmath2 variations on the time scales shorter than the local viscous time @xmath18 .",
    "the viscous time is , on the other hand , the longest time scale of the accretion flow .",
    "hence , it is plausible to suppose that any given radius @xmath17 contributes to @xmath2 and x - ray flux variations predominantly at the frequency @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that in this picture @xmath20 power density spectra can naturally appear with slope @xmath21 , in good agreement with observations .",
    "owing to the finite size of the accretion disk , the longest time scale which can appear in the disk is restricted by the viscous time on its outer boundary @xmath22 . below this frequency",
    "the x - ray flux variations are uncorrelated , therefore the power density spectrum of the accretion disk should become flat at @xmath23 .",
    "due to the mechanism suggested by @xcite are discussed in section [ sec : qpo ] ] if there are several components in the accretion flow each having a different viscous time scale ( e.g. geometrically thin disk and diffuse corona above it ) , several breaks can appear on the power spectra at the frequencies , corresponding to the inverse viscous time scale of each component .",
    "yet another source of @xmath2 variations might be the variability of the mass transfer rate from the donor star . as these variations also have to be propagated through the accretion disk , only low frequency perturbations , with @xmath24 ,",
    "will reach the region of the main energy release .",
    "this might give rise to an independent continuum component in the power density spectrum at @xmath24 .",
    "the shape of the final power density spectrum of x - ray binary will depend on the relative amplitudes of the @xmath2 variations due to different components of the accretion flow and the donor star .",
    "as these are independent from each other , a distinct features should appear in the power density spectrum of x - ray binary at frequencies @xmath25 .",
    "power law.,scaledwidth=51.0% ]    the viscous time scale of the accretion disk is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the disk half thickness and @xmath28 is the keplerian frequency at the outer disk boundary @xmath29 . for a geometrically thin disk , @xmath30 ,",
    "the viscous time scale is significantly longer than the keplerian time at the outer disk boundary .",
    "if the disk fills a large fraction of the roche - lobe of the primary , as is the case for steady disks in persistent lmxbs , @xmath31 , ( section [ sec : tvisc_h2r ] ) , the viscous time at the outer boundary @xmath22 will exceed the orbital period of the binary system @xmath32 as well .",
    "therefore , one might expect to find features associated with the viscous time of the accretion disk at frequencies below the orbital frequency of the binary system .",
    "detection of such features for a sample of lmxbs would give an opportunity to probe the accretion disk parameters , such as viscosity parameter @xmath33 and the disk thickness at its outer boundary .",
    "in this paper we study a sample of persistent low mass x - ray binaries aiming to detect such features in their power density spectra .",
    "longevity of typical orbital periods in lmxbs requires long monitoring observations to achieve this goal .",

    "the fact that this bimodality occurs between compact and wide systems or , equivalently , ( with the exception of grs1915 + 106 ) between small- and large - q binaries suggests that it may be caused by the excitation of tidal resonances in the accretion disk .",

    "the next strongest resonance , most important in the context of binaries with not too extreme values of the mass ratio lies at the 3:1 commensurability .",

    "the latter number is somewhat larger than derived from the xmm - newton data .",
    "this can be explained by smaller inclination angle in this source resulting in lower density along the line of sight .",
    "indeed , unlike exo0748676 showing deep x - ray eclipses , 4u1916053 shows only x - ray dips .      in this picture , the @xmath2 variations in the geometrically thin shakura",
    " sunyaev disk should give rise to the second very low frequency power law component , revealing itself below the break frequency .",
    "such power law component is indeed observed in the power spectra of some of the sources .",
    "most obvious its presence is in cir x1 and 4u1916053 and , to less extent , in sco x1 ( fig.[fig : pds_broadband ] ) . remarkably , the slope of the power spectrum before and after the break are very similar , suggesting similar nature of the processes causing the variability",
    "furthermore , the second break should be expected at the low frequencies , corresponding to the ( larger ) viscous time of the geometrically thin disk .",
    "the frequency of the second break is described by eq.([eq : fbr2forb ] ) with the @xmath196 given by eq.([eq : h2r_ss73 ] ) .",
    "an evidence of the second break may be seen in the power spectra of sco x-1 and , possibly , of 4u1916053 . in the former case",
    "the break frequency equals @xmath247 hz and the ratio @xmath248 . this value is within the range predicted for standard shakura  sunyaev disk with the aspect ratio of @xmath249 , eq.([eq : fvisc2vorb_std ] ) .",
    "the value of the break frequency in the case of 4u1916053 is probably @xmath250 hz , although this number is less secure than that for sco x-1 .",
    "if correct , this is significantly , by @xmath251 dex smaller that expected in the above scenario .    in the conclusion of this section",
    "we note that due to power law dependence of the viscous time scale on the disk radius , @xmath252 , the radial drift velocity of the matter in the accretion flow should be increased throughout the most ( @xmath253 ) of the radial extent of the accretion disk .",
    "therefore the bulge at the outer edge of the disk , resulting from the disk ",
    "stream interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is insufficient as it is located at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "for the same reason this analysis based on the viscous time of the disk probes the outer disk and is insensitive to the conditions in its innermost parts , e.g. @xmath254 , which contribution to the total viscous time is negligibly small .",
    "the dichotomy in the viscous time between long- and short - period systems is naturally explained by excitation of the 3:1 inner lindblad resonance .",
    "this suggestion is supported by detection of superhumps in several lmxbs with small mass ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , the superhumps are detected not only in transient sources but also in one or two persistent lmxbs , including one source from our sample , 4u1916053 @xcite .",
    "the specific mechanism by which the tidal instability is affecting the viscous time of the disk is , however , unclear .",
    "it is also unclear if the coronal flow in the small - q system has indeed @xmath255 and @xmath256 as it is formally required by the observed @xmath257 .",
    "several possibilities can be mentioned :    1 .   mass transfer in tidal waves excited in the disk by the tidal forces .",
    "it has been shown theoretically and confirmed in numerical simulations , that in the non - linear regime strong tidal waves are excited in the accretion disk @xcite . these waves , propagating in the disk with the speed significantly exceeding the radial drift velocity of the matter , can decrease the effective viscous time scale .",
    "if correct , the aspect ratio and coronal temperature in the small - q systems may be not significantly different from those in the large - q ones .",
    "2 .   heating of the outer disk due to resonant tidal interaction @xcite can increase the temperature of the disk and/or coronal flow and , correspondingly , decrease the viscous time scale . as was mentioned above , in order to explain the observed viscous time scale the coronal flow temperature of @xmath256 is required .",
    "non - trivial definition of the viscous time for an eccentric and precessing disk . in the fully developed instability the particles in the disk move on non - circular trajectories with large eccentricity .",
    "therefore , the average velocity of the radial drift of the disk particles can be significantly different from the value predicted by the standard disk theory for a circular keplerian disk .",
    "we note , that the truncation of the accretion disk at the 3:1 resonance radius ( fig.[fig : rdisk ] ) can be excluded as the cause of the shorter viscous time scale in the small-@xmath14 systems , because the change of the outer disk radius by a @xmath258 is insufficient to explain the observed decrease of the viscous time by the factor of @xmath12 .",
    "grs1915 + 105 clearly stands out among other small - q systems ( fig.[fig : fbr2forb ] , right panel ) .",
    "although it has small mass ratio , @xmath259 @xcite , its ratio @xmath6 is close to the value found in the binaries with @xmath260 .",
    "the most plausible explanation of such behavior is related to the transient nature of the source .",
    "we outline two possibilities :    1 .",
    "the tidal instability is known to have a rather long growth time , of the order of @xmath261 binary orbital periods ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . for grs1915 + 105 @xmath154 days and @xmath262 corresponds to @xmath12 years .",
    "therefore the time passed since the onset of the outburst ( @xmath12 years ) was insufficient for the tidal instability to fully develop . in this scenario",
    "one would expect an increase of the break frequency in the course of the outburst , unless the instability growth time is significantly longer than @xmath12 years .",
    "however , no statistically significant difference in the break frequency has been found between the first and second halves of the data .",
    "this fact speaks against the above suggestion .",
    "2 .   due to the large size of the system ( @xmath263 cm )",
    ", the irradiation effects are insufficient to ionize the outer disk in grs1915 + 105 which is in the cold , low - viscosity state ( h.ritter , private communication ) .",
    "therefore its outer boundary is located near the circularization radius rather than has expanded to the tidal radius , as is the case for the persistent sources .",
    "therefore there is no accretion disk at the 3:1 resonance radius ( fig.[fig : rdisk ] ) and the tidal instability is not excited . in this respect",
    "the present outburst of grs1915 + 105 might be similar to normal outbursts in dwarf novae . as well known , for the same reason the superhumps in dwarf novae are observed ( tidal instability is excited ) only in during the superoutbursts but not during the normal outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .      for several sources",
    "broad qpo - like features are obvious in the power density spectra .",
    "most apparent these features are in the case of cyg x-2 and grs1915 + 105 ( fig.[fig : pds_asm ] , [ fig : pds_exosat ] ) . among plausible mechanisms of appearance of quasi periodic variability in x - ray binaries on these time scales",
    "are the radiation - driven warping and precession of the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mass - flow oscillations caused by diffusion instability @xcite .",
    "both types of oscillations are caused by the irradiation of the accretion disk by the primary and their characteristic time scale is of the order of the viscous time scale of the disk .",
    "accordingly , these features should appear near the break frequency in the power density spectrum .",
    "another possible mechanism of appearance of broad low frequency qpos near the viscous frequency of the disk was suggested by @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is related to the anti - correlation of the @xmath2 perturbations in the accretion flow on the time scales @xmath264 .",
    "the anti - correlation appears in the presence of the steady mass supply through the outer boundary of the accretion flow and is a direct consequence of the energy conservation law . in this respect",
    "the broad qpo features observed near the viscous time scale of the outer disk might be similar to the broad qpos detected near the high frequency break of power density spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard state , at frequency of @xmath265 hz @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the values of the break frequency and of the qpo centroid frequency are defined by the viscous time scale of the inner hot flow , @xmath266 r@xmath267 , responsible for the production of the hard comptonized emission in the low spectral state of black hole candidates .",
    "we studied the low frequency variability of low mass x - ray binaries in order to search for the signatures in their power density spectra related to the viscous time scale of the disk .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "as the viscous time is the longest time scale of the accretion disk , the @xmath2 variations produced in the disk due to various instabilities should become independent of each other on the time scales longer than the viscous time , i.e. @xmath268 at @xmath269 correspondingly , the power density of @xmath2 perturbations produced in the disk and of the observed x - ray flux variations should become independent of the frequency at @xmath270 .",
    "2 .   using archival data of rxte / asm and exosat / me we studied x - ray variability of persistent lmxbs in the @xmath271 hz frequency range . in power density spectra of 11 sources out of 12 satisfying our selection criteria",
    ", we found a very low frequency break .",
    "the spectra approximately follow @xmath4 power law above the break and are nearly flat below the break ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pds_asm][fig : pds_broadband ] ) . in some cases",
    "( sco x-1 , cir x-1 and 4u1916053 ) a second power law component with the same slope appears at @xmath272 .",
    "3 .   in a very broad range of binary periods , from @xmath273 min in ultracompact binary 4u1820 - 303 to",
    "@xmath274 days in grs1915 + 105 , the break frequency correlates with the orbital frequency @xmath138 of the binary system ( fig.[fig : fbreak_forb ] ) , in good agreement with the theoretical prediction for the viscous frequency @xmath275 ( eq.[eq : fvisc2forb ] ) 4 .   assuming that the low frequency break is associated with the viscous time scale of the disk , @xmath276 , the measured values of the break frequency imply that the viscous time of the disk is by a factor of @xmath277 shorter than predicted by the standard theory ( section [ sec : tvisc_h2r ] , fig.[fig : fbreak_forb ] ) .",
    "taken at the face value , this requires the relative height of the outer disk @xmath7 .",
    "motivated by the low vertical optical depth of such semi - thick accretion flow we propose instead , that significant fraction of the accretion occurs through the coronal flow above the standard geometrically thin shakura - sunyaev disk ( section [ sec : corona ] , fig.[fig : tau ] ) .",
    "the aspect ratio of the coronal flow , @xmath7 , corresponds to the gas temperature of @xmath278 .",
    "the corona has moderate optical depth in the radial direction , @xmath232 , and contains @xmath279 of the total mass of the accreting matter .",
    "the estimates of the temperature and density of the corona are in quantitative agreement with the parameters inferred by the x - ray spectroscopic observations by chandra and xmm - newton of complex absorption / emission features in the lmxbs with large inclination angle .",
    "we found a clear dichotomy in the @xmath6 between wide and compact system , the accretion flow in the compact systems having @xmath12 times shorter viscous time expressed in the orbital periods of the binary , than in the wide ones ( fig.[fig : fbr2forb ] ) .",
    "the jump in the @xmath11 ratio occurs at the binary system mass ratio of @xmath184 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the dichotomy between small - q and large - q systems is caused by the excitation of the 3:1 lindblad resonance in the small - q systems ( section [ sec : tvisc_lindblad ] ) .",
