    "uncertainty relation states that the uncertainty product of any two incompatible observables has a minimum , but it is possible to reduce the uncertainty of one desired observable below the standard quantum limit at the expense of increasing the complementary one . for spin or angular momentum systems ,",
    "it is often named as spin squeezing if the variance of one angular momentum component , e.g. , @xmath1 or @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath3 @xcite . in recent years",
    ", spin squeezing has attracted considerable attention and has been studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , since it has potential applications in entanglement detection @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite and high - precision measurement , such as ramsey spectroscopy @xcite , atom clocks @xcite , gravitational - wave interferometers @xcite and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , any real quantum system inevitably interacts with its surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "the environment - induced decoherence effects on spin squeezing have attracted considerable attentions .",
    "numerous researchers have indeed demonstrated that spin squeezing is fragile and easily broken by environmental noise @xcite . in particular ,",
    "similar to the discovery of entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite , the sudden death of spin squeezing occurs due to decoherence @xcite , which would be the most limiting factor for the applications of spin squeezing in realistic tasks .",
    "significantly , non - markovian effect has been shown potential advantages for enhancing quantum correlations @xcite , parameter - estimation precision @xcite as well as spin squeezing @xcite in open quantum systems .    although the spin squeezing could be partially recovered by non - markovian effect after a sudden vanishing",
    ", it still decays with time and disappears very fast @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to pursue some strategies that can effectively protect the spin squeezing from decoherence for a long time . in this paper",
    ", we show that the robust preservation of initially prepared spin squeezing states could be achieved with @xmath0 noninteracting qubits ( specifically , two - level atoms ) locally embedded in @xmath0 uncorrelated and identical pcc .",
    "since there is no interaction between the any two pairs of `` qubit+pcc '' , the exchange symmetry between qubits still holds during the dynamical evolution .",
    "thus , the spin squeezing parameter of @xmath0 qubits can be calculated by two - qubit dynamics of local expectations and correlations @xcite . with the analytical expression of spin squeezing parameter in mind ,",
    "we show that , the high spin squeezing could be preserved in both isotropic and anisotropic pcc in the long time limit .",
    "the underlying mechanism is due to the permanent existence of a localized field , and hence the photon - atom bound dressed states are formed which lead to a fractionalized steady - state spin squeezing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we review the fundamental concept of spin squeezing and introduce a spin squeezing parameter which is extensively studied in both theory and experiment . in section [ sec:3 ] , the exact dynamics of a two - level atom trapped in isotropic and anisotropic pcc are examined .",
    "moreover , we find that these dynamical procedure could be characterized by the kraus operators of non - markovian amplitude damping noise . in the section [ sec:4 ] .",
    ", we show that the spin squeezing could be drastically preserved when the atomic frequency is inside the band gap .",
    "the different behaviors of spin squeezing between isotropic and anisotropic pcc are studied in detail .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of @xmath0 spin-1/2 particles and define the collective spin operators as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pauli operators for the @xmath7-th particle . according to the heisenberg uncertainty relation ,",
    "the variances of the collective spin components are bounded by the following equation : @xmath8 with @xmath9 . for a spin squeezed state ,",
    "the @xmath1 or @xmath2 is smaller than the standard quantum limit @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the initial state of the @xmath0 qubits is generated in the one - axis twisted spin squeezed state @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the ground and excited states . to quantify the degree of useful spin squeezing , there are various measures of spin squeezing related to various inequality criteria @xcite . here , we focus on the spin squeezing parameter @xmath13 which is proposed by wineland _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath13 is substantially connected to the improvement of the sensitivity of ramsey spectroscopy , and thus is attractive for experimental implementation .",
    "the squeezing parameter @xmath13 is defined as the ratio of the phase sensitivity of a general state versus the coherent spin state @xmath14 where the minimization of @xmath15 is over all the directions that are perpendicular to the mean spin direction @xmath16 .",
    "note that the spin squeezing parameter @xmath13 could be expressed as the function of local expectations and correlations due to the exchange symmetry of the one - axis twisted state @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath13 could be written as follows @xmath17}{\\langle\\sigma_{z}^{(1)}\\rangle^2 } , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the system raising and inversion operators , respectively .",
    "for the initial state of ( [ eq3 ] ) , these local expectations and correlations are calculated as @xmath20    in order to exhibit the preservation of spin squeezing more conveniently , we re - express the spin squeezing parameter as follows @xmath21 note that @xmath22 for spin squeezed states and @xmath23 for coherent spin states .",
    "our physical model contains @xmath0 independent and identical subsystems in which each qubit is embedded in a pcc .",
    "since there are no interactions at all between the subsystems , the whole hamiltonian can be described via the sum of @xmath0 independent qubit plus pcc hamiltonians . in the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian of each subsystem `` qubit+pcc '' is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of @xmath27-th mode of the pcc .",
    "@xmath28 is the strength of coupling between the qubit and the @xmath27-th mode , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the magnitude and unit vector of the atomic dipole moment .",
    "@xmath31 is the quantization volume , and @xmath32 is the coulomb constant .",
    "we assume that the pcc is initially in the vacuum state and the atom is prepared in the excited state . since only one excitation is involved in this subsystem and the total excitation number @xmath33 of equation ( [ eq10 ] )",
    "is conserved , then the state vector of the subsystem at an arbitrary time @xmath34 has the form @xmath35 the state vector @xmath36 denotes no excitation existing in any mode of the pcc , and @xmath37 represents one excitation in the @xmath27-th mode .",
    "according to the time - dependent schrdinger equation and in the interaction picture , we can obtain the following integrodifferential equation of @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] is the delay green s function .",
    "in fact , @xmath41 is a two - time correlation function of the environment which measures the environment s memory effect . for the free - space case ,",
    "the spectrum of the radiation field is infinitely broad and slowly varying , the memory effect is infinitesimally small and could be safely neglected .",
    "then the green function reduces to the form of dirac delta function @xmath42 which exhibits exponential spontaneous emission decay of the atomic excited - state population , where @xmath43 is the decay rate @xcite .",
    "however , if the atom is embedded in a pcc , the decay rate is strongly modified , since the dispersion characteristic of radiation waves is deformed by the periodic dielectric structures of the pcc . in this paper , we consider two typical types of pcc that are widely investigated in previous literatures .      assuming the photonic density of the states becomes singular at the band - gap edge , the dispersion relation of the pcc near the band gap edge @xmath44 can be approximately written as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath44 is the band edge frequency and @xmath46 is a model dependent constant .",
    "note that this dispersion relation is isotropic ( i.e. , one - dimension ) since it depends only on the magnitude @xmath27 of the wave vector .",
    "starting from equation ( [ eq14 ] ) and using the laplace transform method , we can obtain the expression of the amplitude @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the detuning @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is the purely imaginary root of @xmath51 in the region [ @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while @xmath54 is the complex root of @xmath55 in the region [ @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    ", the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are defined as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 .      although the dispersion relation is very simple for the isotropic pcc , a real pcc in general has anisotropic structure in momentum space .",
    "thus the photon dispersion relation dominated by the periodic dielectric structure is usually three - dimension .",
    "numerical simulations show that the band edge is associated with a finite collection of symmetry related points @xmath64 rather than the isotropic case @xmath65 .",
    "then the effective anisotropic dispersion relation can be expressed approximately by @xcite @xmath66 using this dispersion relation and following the similar calculations , we can obtain the expression of the amplitude @xmath67",
    "@xcite @xmath68 ^ 2}dz,\\nonumber \\label{eq17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the angle between atomic dipole vector and @xmath71 .",
    "the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are defined as @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is the purely imaginary root of @xmath77 in the region [ @xmath78 or @xmath79 , while @xmath80 is the complex root of @xmath81 in the region [ @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "note that the existence of @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is highly dependent on the detuning @xmath88 , i.e. , the relative positions between atomic frequency @xmath89 and the band edge frequency @xmath44 .",
    "the three terms in equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) determine three different emission fields , which are localized field , propagating field and diffusion field , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the isotropic case where @xmath50 and @xmath54 can exist together when the atomic transition frequency is far from the band edge and inside the gap , @xmath76 and @xmath80 can not coexist for the two - level atom in the anisotropic pcc @xcite .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that the density of states is finite near the band edge in the anisotropic pcc rather than infinite in the isotropic case . as we will show below",
    ", this difference will result in significant influence on the dynamics of spin squeezing .",
    "before we turn to discuss the dynamics of spin squeezing with atoms trapped in pcc , we remarkably note that the above dynamical procedures could be reformulated mathematically as a completely positive , trace - preserving ( cptp ) linear map on the initial density operator of the qubit @xcite .",
    "the corresponding kraus operators are given as @xmath90 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denotes the isotropic and anisotropic pcc .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the kraus operators of equation ( [ eq18 ] ) represent an amplitude damping noise .",
    "however , we emphasize that this amplitude damping noise should be non - markovian since we have considered the memory effect of the pcc which has been registered self - consistently in the kernel function @xmath41 in equation ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "according to the analysis of refs . @xcite , calculating the dynamics of @xmath0-qubit spin squeezing can be reduced to determine the dynamics of two - qubit local expectations and correlations since the exchange symmetry of initial state always holds during the decoherence .",
    "based on the kraus operators given by equation ( [ eq18 ] ) , we obtain the local expectations and correlations as follows @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the expectation of initial state given by equations ( [ eq6])-([eq8 ] ) . substituting equations ( [ eq19])-([eq21 ] ) into equation ( [ eq5 ] )",
    ", we can eventually determine the explicit formula of the spin squeezing parameter @xmath13 @xmath93}{\\left[|q(t)|^2\\langle\\sigma_{z}^{(1)}\\rangle_{0}+|q(t)|^2 - 1\\right]^2},\\ ] ] as well as @xmath94 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spin squeezing parameter @xmath95 is directly related to the time behavior of the single - qubit excited - state population @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , one can control the spin squeezing by modulating the time - dependent function @xmath96 . as shown in equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) , the behavior of @xmath96 is mainly determined by the detuning @xmath49 and the dispersion relation of pcc .",
    "e.g. , isotropic or anisotropic .       in the isotropic case , for various values of detuning .",
    "dashed line @xmath97 , solid line @xmath98 , dotted - dashed line @xmath99 , dotted line @xmath100 and star - solid line @xmath101 .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the behavior of spin squeezing parameter @xmath95 as a function of the scaled time @xmath104 for various values of detuning under the isotropic dispersion .",
    "the dashed and solid lines show the results of spin squeezing when @xmath97 and @xmath98 , namely , the atomic frequency is inside the band gap . we find that the spin squeezing shows rapid quasi - oscillations and finally yields to a definite value in the long - time limit . the quasi - oscillations and steady - state spin squeezing",
    "can be all attributed to the formation of photon - atom dressed states @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "as implied by equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , the three radiation fields could coexist since the roots @xmath50 and @xmath54 can exist together when @xmath89 is near the band gap .",
    "the strong interactions between the atom and these radiation fields result in photon - atom dressed states . in this case",
    ", the interference between dressed states leads to the quasi - oscillatory behavior of the spin squeezing .",
    "particularly , the bound dressed state with no decay is formed due to the permanent existence of localized filed . therefore , a fractionalized steady - state spin squeezing is preserved even when @xmath105 .",
    "if the atomic frequency is tunneled far outside the band gap , the localized field disappears and no bound dressed state could be formed , then the spin squeezing decays exponentially ( see star - solid line in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .     as a function of @xmath106 in the isotropic case with the other parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the inset clearly shows that the @xmath107 exponentially decreases but never equals to zero when the atomic frequency is outside the band edge.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to have a better understanding of the effect of detuning on spin squeezing preservation , we calculate the steady - state spin squeezing .",
    "when time goes to infinity , the last two terms in equation ( [ eq15 ] ) turn to zero and only the first term remains , which contributes to the preservation of spin squeezing .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] plots the asymptotic value of spin squeezing parameter @xmath107 as a function of @xmath106 .",
    "we see that the steady - state spin squeezing is nearer to its maximum value for the atomic frequency farther from the band edge and deeper inside the gap .",
    "remarkably , spin squeezing is partially preserved even when the atomic frequency lies outside of the band gap , but not far from the band edge since the bound state is still formed . as the atomic frequency is completely outside the band edge , the asymptotic value of spin squeezing exponentially decreases but never equals to zero , as displayed in the inset of figure [ fig2 ] .       in the anisotropic case , for various values of detuning .",
    "dashed line @xmath108 , solid line @xmath109 , dotted - dashed line @xmath99 , dotted line @xmath110 and star - solid line @xmath111 .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath112 , @xmath102 and @xmath103.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for the anisotropic pcc , as we mentioned above , the most significant difference is that @xmath76 and @xmath80 can not coexist , namely , only one localized field or propagating field is present .",
    "consequently , there is no interference between the dressed states .",
    "hence , we expect the spin squeezing does not show quasi - oscillations during the evolution .",
    "numerical simulation confirms this behavior , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] . when @xmath108 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 , the bound state is formed due to the dressing of localized field , which results in the long - time preservation of spin squeezing , but no quasi - oscillations are observed since the propagating field is absent in this region .",
    "when @xmath110 or @xmath115 , the localized field disappears and only propagating field is present . as there is no bound state",
    "is formed , so the spin squeezing changes to zero .     as a function of @xmath116 in the anisotropic case with the other parameters @xmath112 , @xmath102 and @xmath103.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another manifestation of the anisotropic dispersion relation on the spin squeezing preservation",
    "is that the asymptotic value of spin squeezing parameter @xmath107 becomes more sensitive to the changes of detuning than that in the isotropic case .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] clearly shows this difference . unlike the result shown in figure [ fig2 ] , where the asymptotic value of spin squeezing varies smoothly when the atomic frequency moves from the inside to the outside band edge , in the anisotropic case , @xmath107 experiences a sudden transition when @xmath89 is near the band edge @xmath44 .",
    "the underlying physical reason is that the density of states has been assumed to be infinite near the band edge in the isotropic pcc . due to the singularity of in density of states at @xmath44 ,",
    "the localized field is still existence when the atomic frequency is near @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , a fractionalized spin squeezing is preserved in the isotropic case .",
    "even when the atomic frequency is completely outside the gap , the asymptotic value of spin squeezing only exponentially decreases but never equals to zero .",
    "however , for the anisotropic case , the density of states is finite at @xmath44 .",
    "the localized field suddenly disappears when @xmath89 approaches to the band edge from the inside gap , which leads to a sudden transition of @xmath107 when @xmath89 is near the band edge , for example , @xmath117 when @xmath112 , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "in fact , if @xmath44 is large enough , the location of sudden transition point is close to @xmath118 .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the spin squeezing dynamics of an ensemble of @xmath0 independent qubits coupled to their local and identical pcc .",
    "thanks to the conserved exchange symmetry of qubits under decoherence , the exact expressions of spin squeezing parameter can be obtained by the two - qubit local expectations and correlations .",
    "two typical types of pcc , i.e. , isotropic and anisotropic pcc are considered .",
    "we have shown that the spin squeezing can be drastically preserved in both two cases with the assistance of detuning modification .",
    "particularly , there are quasi - oscillations of spin squeezing in the isotropic case , due to the interference of coexisted localized field and propagating field , while in the anisotropic case no quasi - oscillations occur .",
    "intriguingly , it is noted that a sudden transition of steady - state spin squeezing emerges for the anisotropic case when the qubit frequency is near the band edge .",
    "this sudden transition is rooted in fact that the density of states of the anisotropic pcc is finite at the band edge .",
    "we argue that the strategy presented in this paper , which enables the long time spin squeezing preservation against environmental noise , is potentially practical since neither complex reservoir engineering nor pulse series is required in our protocol .",
    "the robust spin squeezing preservation is attained only by utilizing a simple detuning modulation between the qubit and the band gap , which could be easily achieved in experiment , e.g. , by stark - shifting the qubit s frequency with a static electric field .",
