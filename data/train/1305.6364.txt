    "in this paper , human travel records were collected from four great cities by taxis , subways and surveys ( see details in methods [ mm : dataset ] ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that the exponential law of collective human movements does exist in urban areas of cities ( see methods [ mm : distr ] ) .    in order to understand the exponential law of collective human mobility in urban areas ,",
    "it is essential to model individual flows from one region to the other in a city .",
    "although the gravity model @xcite has already been applied widely to predict flows , including human travel @xcite , cargo ship movement @xcite and telephone communications @xcite , it still has some flaws such as incompetence to explain the discrepancy of the numbers of individual flows in both directions between a pair of locations . then in order to fix its disadvantages , simini et al .",
    "@xcite put forward the radiation model without parameters . in this model , the expected flux @xmath0 from location @xmath1 to @xmath2",
    "is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the populations of location @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath6 is the number of trips starting from @xmath1 and @xmath7 is the total population of locations ( except @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) from which to @xmath1 the distances are less than or equal to @xmath8 ( the distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the model can predict population movements between counties or cities successfully @xcite , but it is not clear whether the model applies to intra - urban movements as well .",
    "especially noteworthy is that in urban areas , it is difficult to obtain population distribution directly because of high mobility .",
    "moreover , because people often move frequently for various purposes in cities , it is unsuitable to use resident population to model individual flows . compared to the resident population , the average daily population occurring in a zone of city is more reasonable to characterize the urban mobility . because it establishes a bond between human travel intensity and the function of the zone .",
    "so , in this paper , we regard the number of trips arriving at a zone as the population of the zone , which is proportional to the actual average daily population approximately .    after calculating the population of zones , the results of simulation in beijing by the radiation model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation ] . from the figure",
    ", it seems that the predicted flux has a large deviation from the actual ones and the model underestimates the probabilities of trips with distances larger than 1 km .",
    "similarly , the same phenomena can also be observed in other three cities , which are not included here .",
    "the possible reason to account for the incapability of radiation model is that there are different travel habits and preferences existing in trips at different scales of space .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider a new model to understand intra - urban human mobility patterns .",
    "stands for the actual flows equal with predicted ones .",
    "the black points are the mean values of predicted flux in the bins .",
    "the ends of whisker represent the 9th and 91st percentile in the bins.,title=\"fig : \" ]   stands for the actual flows equal with predicted ones .",
    "the black points are the mean values of predicted flux in the bins .",
    "the ends of whisker represent the 9th and 91st percentile in the bins.,title=\"fig : \" ]    inspired by the gravity model @xcite , we assume that the probability arriving at a location has a positive correlation with the population density of the location , but has a negative correlation with the euclidean distance between the location and the originated location .",
    "hence , in our model the probability of a trip reaching the location @xmath9 , conditioned on starting from the location @xmath10 , is defined as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the population density function and @xmath13 is a function of distance between locations , which is usually given by two frequently used forms : power law and exponential .",
    "likewise , as for regions , the probability of a trip arriving at the region @xmath2 , conditioned on originating from the region @xmath1 , is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the population of regions .",
    "then the probability of a trip from region @xmath1 to @xmath2 can be derived as @xmath16 where @xmath17 means the normalized population indicating the possibility of originating a trip from the region .",
    "assuming @xmath18 is the total number of trips , the expected number of trips from region @xmath1 to @xmath2 can be concluded as @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "as described in the gravity model , the number of trips from region @xmath1 to @xmath2 is equal with the one from region @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "however , that is not the case in our model because the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on geographic positions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , which are often not equal to each other .",
    "therefore , it is more consistent with actual situations .",
    "after given the actual trips , the parameter of function @xmath13 in our model can be determined by using the method of maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) . after inspecting the two forms of function @xmath13 carefully , it is found that the power - law form @xmath23 is much better .",
    "the power - law exponents @xmath24 in our model for the four cities - beijing , london , chicago and los angeles - are 1.601 , 0.402 , 1.832 and 1.805 respectively . by using our model to simulate human travels in the four cities ,",
    "the relationships between actual and predicted traffic flows are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prediction ] . from the subgraphs",
    ", it can be observed that the red lines @xmath25 almost lie between the 9th and the 91st percentiles in all bins except the last bin in los angeles , indicating that the model can predict the number of trips between regions accurately .",
    "moreover , the comparisons of distributions of actual and simulated trip lengths are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pred_distdistr ] .",
    "it is discovered that the simulated distributions accord with the actual ones very well in the four cities .",
    "the fitted exponential parameters for the simulated distance distributions in the four cities are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , which are very close to the fitted values for actual trip - length distributions as shown in table [ tb : mle_exp ] . in summary",
    ", our model with the form of power law can be treated as an appropriate model to predict traffic flows in urban areas .          from the model ,",
    "it is apparent that the spatial population distribution has an important impact on collective human mobility .",
    "taking beijing as an example , it is investigated that how the geographic population distribution could affect the trip - length distribution .",
    "first , considering the population distribution is uniform , individual trips could be predicted by our model with different parameters @xmath24 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_bj](a ) , contrary to the actual trip - length distribution , the simulated distance distributions accord to power laws with exponential cutoff very well and decay more slowly .",
    "the power - law exponents of the two simulated distributions are -0.716 for @xmath30 ( green triangles ) and -1.100 for @xmath31 ( red stars ) , which approach to the analytical results @xmath32 ( see methods [ mm : proof ] ) .",
    "second , remaining the distribution of population numbers of cells unchanged , three synthetic population distributions are generated by randomized rearranging the population numbers of cells . in simulations of human trips ,",
    "the parameter @xmath24 of our model is the fixed value 1.601 , which is the same as the actual one in beijing . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_bj](b ) , the simulated distributions are similar to each other and could be described by power - law distributions better . in summary , these demonstrate that not only the distribution of population numbers but also the layout of them could influence the trip - length distribution .",
    "thus , it is necessary to study the spatial distribution of urban population . here",
    "the relationships between the normalized average density and the distance to urban centers are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pop_density ] for four cities ( the details of calculating densities can be referred in methods [ mm : pop ] ) . from the graph , it can be observed that , for different selected centers of each city , the average urban densities have similar trends .",
    "more importantly , the densities for four cities all decay exponentially with the increase of distance to the urban centers . and",
    "it is worth noting that the declining slopes are not far from the exponents of exponential estimated from the corresponding distance distributions shown in table [ tb : mle_exp ] .        assuming the density function @xmath33 is a negative exponential function that depends on the distance @xmath34 to the center @xmath35 where c is a constant .",
    "the distance distribution @xmath36 can be derived as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants ( see the proof in methods [ mm : proof ] ) .",
    "hence when @xmath40 , the exponential section dominates and @xmath36 begins to decay exponentially .",
    "then , it is aimed to verify the analytical result through simulating human trips based on our model further .",
    "and our model is simulated on grid cells whose size is @xmath41 .",
    "when fixing the model parameter @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_proof](a ) , the simulated trip - length distributions all exhibit exponential tails and the parameters of exponential distributions approach to the corresponding parameters @xmath42 of population density distribution . from the fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_proof](b ) , the distance distributions have similar rates of exponential decay indicating that the model parameter @xmath24 has little influence on the exponential tails of distributions when fixing the parameter @xmath42 of the density function . in conclusion",
    ", the result of proof agrees with the simulations very well .    .",
    "the simulated distance distributions , corresponding to different @xmath42 ( 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.4 ) , decay exponentially with slope 0.085 ( blue dashed line ) , 0.180 ( green dash - dot line ) , 0.414 ( red dotted line ) respectively .",
    "( b ) different model parameters with the fixed population density distribution ( @xmath43).,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the simulated distance distributions , corresponding to different @xmath42 ( 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.4 ) , decay exponentially with slope 0.085 ( blue dashed line ) , 0.180 ( green dash - dot line ) , 0.414 ( red dotted line ) respectively .",
    "( b ) different model parameters with the fixed population density distribution ( @xmath43).,title=\"fig : \" ]    according to the analytical result , it could be explained why the exponential parameters of actual distance distributions are close to the ones of population density distributions in the four cities .",
    "furthermore , in urban areas , the density usually decreases significantly leading to a large exponent @xmath42 , thus a short range of power - law section .",
    "meanwhile , it must be noticed that the power of @xmath44 is often larger than -1 because of @xmath45 like the four cities in our datasets , which is such a slow power - law decay and obviously not a lvy walk that has been observed in collective human movements in large scale of space .",
    "therefore , it can explain the reason why the distance distribution of human trips in urban areas accords with an exponential distribution much better .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the empirical density distributions in four cities is the same as the clark s model @xcite , which is the most influential model for describing urban population density .",
    "since then , some studies have proposed other mathematical forms for population density .",
    "for example , the inverse power function is employed by smeed @xcite .",
    "though some controversies , parr @xcite suggests that the negative exponential function is more appropriate to model the density in urban areas , while the inverse power function is more appropriate to model the variation of density in the urban fringe and hinterland .",
    "therefore , the phase transition of population density function in different scales of space may be able to explain the different laws emerging in collective human mobility patterns .",
    "in the paper , it is aimed to understand the exponential law of intra - urban human mobility at the population level .",
    "the four travel datasets in urban areas of cities are analyzed , which further confirm the exponential law . through considering the travel flows between regions ,",
    "it is clear that the radiation model is incapable to model collective human movements in urban areas . because of this",
    ", a new model is proposed , which can predict traffic flows between regions very well . based on our model , it is discovered that the average population density decreasing exponentially with distance to the urban center ultimately leads to the exponential law of collective human mobility patterns .",
    "moreover , the difference of population distribution in different scales of space may be able to explain the different laws ( power - law and exponential ) in collective human movements .",
    "in fact , from the exponential law , it is hard to conclude that the trip lengths at the individual level follow a power - law distribution .",
    "it must be noted that most empirical studies about human mobility patterns are at the population level , but many models are aimed to explore the origin of scaling law at the individual level .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a scale - free distribution of the aggregated movement lengths can also be obtained from individuals with different exponential distributions of movement lengths .",
    "a new evidence in human temporal dynamics @xcite is that , although the aggregated intercall durations follow a power - law distribution , the durations at the individual level follow a power - law distribution for only a small number of individuals and a weibull distribution for the majority .",
    "in addition , the research of human mobility is inspired by animals .",
    "there are yet some controversies @xcite on whether animals exhibit lvy - like behaviour .",
    "because of these , the individual mobility patterns should be considered carefully and more comprehensive human travel records are needed for deeply empirical analysis .",
    "the dataset is about the taxis gps data generated by over 10 thousand taxis in beijing , china , during three months ended on dec .",
    "31st , 2010 @xcite . based on taxis locations and statuses of occupation ( with passengers or without passengers ) ,",
    "trajectories of passengers can be observed . after dividing the urban areas of beijing ( inside the 6th ring road ) into grid - like cells with size @xmath46 , a total of 11776743 trajectories between 3450 cells were extracted .",
    "the dataset contains about 5% samples of human trips by tube in london , which were captured by oyster cards during a week in november 2009 ( available online at http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/ ) . in the dataset ,",
    "the stations that a journey started or ended at were recorded .",
    "it was noticed that some stations were very close to each other , even less than 200 m. because of too small area of regions , it could not reflect the regular mobility patterns between regions obviously . after merging some adjacent stations , we obtained 183 voronoi cells based on stations and a total of 667584 trips between them .",
    "the dataset used here comes from the household travel tracker survey in chicago metropolitan areas conducted by chicago metropolitan agency for planning from january 2007 to february 2008 ( available online at http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/travel-tracker-survey/ ) .",
    "the survey contained various kinds of information about households and travel activities of household members . among them ,",
    "the trips occurred in the cook county were considered which is seen as the urban area of the city according to the population density .",
    "then we extracted a total of 43881 trips between the 1314 zones which correspond to the census tracts .",
    "the post - census regional household travel survey , sponsored by the southern california association of governments in 2001 , was aimed to investigate human travel behavior in the los angeles region of california ( available online at http://www.scag.ca.gov/travelsurvey/ ) .",
    "the region consisted of six counties . in terms of the survey data ,",
    "it was paid more attention to the movements in the los angeles county . as a result , based on the census tracts ,",
    "the county was divided into 2017 zones and a total of 46000 tracks were identified between these zones .",
    "there are three candidate models ( power law , exponential and truncated pareto ) to be compared for describing the empirical distribution of travel distances .",
    "the parameters of these models are determined by the method of maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) .",
    "the akaike weights are calculated , which are considered as relative likelihoods being the best model .",
    "the model with the largest akaike weight should be selected as the best one .",
    "the details of methods can be found in @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_distr ] , the distribution of trip lengths in each city is better fitted by the exponential rather than the power law or truncated paretos . moreover ,",
    "the akaike weight of exponential model ( @xmath47 equals about 1.0 ) is significantly larger than the ones of the other two models in each city .",
    "these all demonstrate that the exponential law of collective human movements exists in urban areas of cities extensively .",
    "furthermore , the fitted results of the exponential model in four cities are shown in table [ tb : mle_exp ] .",
    "the 95% ci represents the 95% confidence interval of the exponential parameter . and the goodness of fit ( gof ) is measured by the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic .",
    "the smaller the value is , the more similar the empirical distance distribution and the fitted exponential model are .",
    "the spatial distribution of population in a city is often characterized by average population density with the distance to the urban center . as for the dataset of beijing ,",
    "the trips are in very fine granularity and there are similar - sized regions ( cells ) with small area . after selecting the cells with high densities as urban centers ,",
    "the average densities with distance to centers are calculated easily .",
    "but , for the datasets of other three cities , there are coarse granularity of travels and irregular zones .",
    "it is not suitable to compute the average density directly . therefore , assuming that population density in each zone is uniform , the urban area is divided into grid - like cells with size @xmath48 .",
    "the population density of each cell is regard as the density of the zone in which the cell lies . finally , the average densities with distance can be calculated based on these divided grid cells .          as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monocenter ] , the center is the point @xmath49 and the non - increasing density distribution is @xmath50 , where @xmath34 is the distance to the center @xmath49 and @xmath51 is the size of a city . by using our model , we can estimate the displacement distribution of human movements as follows : @xmath52"
