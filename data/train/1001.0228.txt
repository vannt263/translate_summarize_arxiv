    "<S> in this article we further the study of non - commutative motives , initiated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the construction of a symmetric monoidal structure on the localizing motivator of dg categories . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain : ( 1 ) a computation of the spectra of morphisms in in terms of non - connective algebraic @xmath0-theory ; ( 2 ) a fully - faithful embedding of kontsevich s category @xmath1 of non - commutative mixed motives into the base category of the localizing motivator ; ( 3 ) a simple construction of the chern character maps from non - connective algebraic @xmath0-theory to negative and periodic cyclic homology ; ( 4 ) a precise connection between ton s secondary @xmath0-theory and the grothendieck ring of @xmath1 ; ( 5 ) a description of the euler characteristic in @xmath1 in terms of hochschild homology . </S>"
