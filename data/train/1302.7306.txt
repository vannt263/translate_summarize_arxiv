    "in the fireball model @xcite , gamma ray bursts are thought to be generated by a hot explosion which expands and compresses itself into a thin ultrarelativistic shell .",
    "internal collisions of such shells are thought to generate the prompt burst of gamma rays , after which afterglow emission is produced during the further expansion of the shell .",
    "eventually this shell transfers its energy into a relativistic blastwave propagating into the circumburst medium . during the transfer process",
    "there is an interesting phase of the evolution , during which the shell is unstable to the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the instability requires a density gradient , for example at the interface between two fluids of different density . in this case , the two fluids are the material contained in the original explosion ( the ejecta ) and the ambient gas swept up by the explosion ( the circumburst medium ) .",
    "once the explosion has begun to sweep up a non - negligible amount of mass , two shocks form .",
    "one of the shocks drives its way forward into the ambient gas , and the other back into the ejecta . between the two shocks",
    "resides the contact discontinuity , marking the separation between ambient gas and ejecta .",
    "it is this contact discontinuity which is unstable .",
    "the instability should have some observable signatures .",
    "this is primarily due to its impact on the reverse shock , which might be observable in the afterglow radiation from the burst , or perhaps even in the prompt emission .",
    "the dynamics of the rayleigh - taylor instability should be taken into account in order to accurately predict the magnitude and frequency of the so - called  optical flash \" associated with the reverse shock . additionally ,",
    "if the instability generates enough shear to cascade into kelvin - helmholtz turbulence , this could amplify magnetic fields which facilitate synchrotron emission . finally , it is unknown whether rayleigh - taylor fingers might propagate all the way up to the forward shock @xcite , possibly altering the fundamental dynamics of the shock , which are generally thought to be governed by the blandford - mckee solution @xcite in the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "these considerations motivate the calculation of the growth of the rayleigh - taylor instability in the physical context of a relativistic fireball .",
    "the nonrelativistic case was first treated by @xcite , who analytically calculated the linear growth rate of the instability , and also explored numerically its linear growth and nonlinear saturation .",
    "@xcite later performed a two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics calculation which demonstrated how magnetic fields tend to align themselves along rayleigh - taylor fingers .",
    "the relativistic case is relevant for gamma ray bursts , which have lorentz factors @xmath5 , and relativistic effects should qualitatively change the physics of the instability .",
    "first , the growth rate is modified by time dilation @xcite .",
    "secondly , causality arguments dictate which modes grow and saturate during different phases of evolution , analogous to the growth of structure in cosmology .",
    "additionally , any turbulence being generated is relativistic turbulence , which may have distinct properties from nonrelativistic turbulence @xcite . finally , while the sedov - taylor solution is a fast attractor , the relativistic blandford - mckee solution is a slow attractor @xcite .",
    "any deviation from blandford - mckee due to rayleigh - taylor fingers might persist until the shock becomes nonrelativistic .    to extend the nonrelativistic results into the relativistic regime",
    ", @xcite performed a stability analysis on the two - shock solution @xcite and found linear growth rates which could potentially be large enough to impact the forward shock .    in this work ,",
    "we evolve a relativistic fireball numerically in 2d , to calculate its dynamics , and to explore the consequences of this instability to observations of gamma ray bursts and their afterglows . we study in detail how the qualitative features of turbulence are changed by relativistic effects ( figure [ fig : times ] ) , and we describe generally how the dynamics of the two - shock system are affected . to improve code performance , we use a moving numerical mesh , which follows the radial motion of the bulk flow and reduces the advection errors associated with this motion . doing this results in a vastly improved calculation of the shock dynamics , and an increased sensitivity to the subtle effects that must be captured .",
    "the code is also able to perform calculations with large lorentz factors ( @xmath6 ) , which allows us to probe astrophysically relevant regions of parameter space .",
    "we solve the relativistic hydrodynamics equations : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the proper mass density , @xmath10 is the pressure , and @xmath11 is the four velocity .",
    "we use units for which c = 1 .",
    "we also evolve a passive scalar field , @xmath12 , according to @xmath13 this allows us to track the growth of the instability , demarking which fluid elements are in the ejecta and which are in the circumburst medium .",
    "we set @xmath14 for the ejecta behind the contact discontinuity , and @xmath15 for the ambient gas in front .",
    "the numerical method we employ is a variant of the tess method @xcite with specific application to problems involving rapid radial outflow .",
    "tess is a finite - volume , moving - mesh hydrodynamics method which in its original form constructs its numerical mesh from a voronoi tessellation of the computational domain .",
    "the computational zones move with the local fluid velocity , and change their shape and size as they move and shear past one another . in this sense , the method is effectively lagrangian .",
    "this idea can be improved if the moving mesh is not generated from a voronoi tessellation , but instead is specifically tailored to a given flow .",
    "most of the numerical benefits from tess do not come from the voronoi tessellation , but from the simple fact that cells are allowed to move .",
    "this enables resolution of contact discontinuities to very high precision , and potentially allows for much longer timesteps . by moving the mesh , but choosing a particular shape for grid cells ( other than voronoi )",
    ", the code can be adapted to the problem at hand .",
    "the tess method defines its numerical mesh abstractly , so that all that is required to take into account a given mesh topology are the positions and volumes of computational zones , and the positions and areas of  faces \" , which are simply defined to be any boundary between two zones .",
    "this means more specific mesh topologies can be generated without changing anything fundamental about the method .",
    "we have previously made this adaptation for keplerian flow in a gaseous disk @xcite . in that case , instead of voronoi cells , the cells were chosen to be wedge - like annular segments like those of a standard polar grid , and they rotated with the local orbital velocity .",
    "we now specifically refer to the shearing - disk version as the disco code .    in this work ,",
    "we take a similar approach , but instead adapt the grid to a radial outflow , such as a jet . the wedge - like annular shape",
    "is still employed , but instead of rotating , the grid expands and shears radially ( figure [ fig : jetcode ] ) .",
    "the numerics are nearly identical to disco ; we have merely changed the direction of grid motion . by moving the mesh radially instead of azimuthally",
    ", the code effectively behaves as a series of one - dimensional lagrangian codes , coupled laterally by transverse fluxes .",
    "the moving grid helps to capture the growth of the instability , and it also allows accurate calculations for large lorentz factors @xmath6 .",
    "we integrate the equations in two dimensions assuming axisymmetry .",
    "the computational domain consists of an angular wedge @xmath16 .",
    "we use an angular resolution @xmath17 and a resolution in the radial dimension of @xmath18 , which were chosen for a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the number of radial zones varies throughout the course of the calculation , because zones are added and removed from the computational domain as necessary during the course of the calculation .",
    "the aspect ratio of a typical computational zone is of order unity , but if a cell becomes too long or short , the grid is dynamically refined or de - refined by splitting or merging zones .",
    "aspect ratios in general range between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the inner and outer radial boundaries of the domain can also move during the time integration , so that only fraction of the dynamical range must be covered at any one time .",
    "the calculation begins with a hot explosion with a given energy @xmath22 and mass @xmath23 with characteristic lorentz factor @xmath24 , within a negligibly small radius , in a cold uniform - density medium with density @xmath25 .",
    "this specifies the problem completely , provided we have a definition for  negligibly small radius \" .",
    "the initial radius @xmath26 of the explosion must be small enough that the  coasting phase \" at @xmath27 and the  spreading phase \" at @xmath28 occur long before the shell begins to decelerate , at the deceleration time @xmath29 in this limit ( @xmath30 ) , the initial structure of the fireball has no effect on what happens after @xmath31 ( we have checked this empirically ) .",
    "this is the so - called  thin - shell \" limit . at @xmath32 , the shell decelerates , which causes the formation of the forward and reverse shocks",
    "this generates a self - similar solution which persists until @xmath33 , where @xmath34 during this phase of expansion , between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the rayleigh - taylor instability is most significant .    to capture the first phases of evolution",
    ", we evolve the explosion in one dimension from the initial fireball until a time @xmath37 , when the mass in the forward shock is still a small fraction of the mass of the ejecta . then the code is switched to evolve the system in 2d , to capture the growth of the instability . at this point",
    ", we also set the value of x on either side of the blast wave ( @xmath38 behind and @xmath39 in front ) .",
    "the initial parameters are e , m , and @xmath25 , but due to scale invariance , in this thin - shell limit the only parameter which must be varied is the energy per unit mass in the fireball , @xmath40 .",
    "thus all the parameter space of this problem is reduced to this single variable . in this study , we use values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . we have also performed calculations with @xmath41 but resolution was insufficient to correctly evolve the instability . the @xmath42 case will be presented in a future work .    in principle , the instability grows from some seed perturbations which break the spherical symmetry of the initial conditions .",
    "however , we found that for weak enough perturbations the saturated instability does not depend ( in a statistical sense ) on how the perturbations are seeded",
    ". this includes the limit where there are no explicit perturbations , but the instability is seeded with numerical noise , which is extremely small but still large enough to break the symmetry . all calculations performed here did not use explicit perturbations to seed the instability .",
    "in figure [ fig : times ] we demonstrate how relativistic effects can affect the character of rayleigh - taylor turbulence .",
    "we show a snapshot at @xmath43 for various values of @xmath44 , which is roughly a proxy for the initial lorentz factor . for larger lorentz factors ,",
    "the fastest growing modes can be found on smaller angular scales .",
    "this has to do with causality ; the saturated instability favors large - scale modes , but there is a large - scale cutoff given by the horizon scale , @xmath45 .",
    "modes larger than this scale do not grow .",
    "this is most explicitly shown in the power spectrum of the contact discontinuity , which we have plotted in figure [ fig : mag ] .",
    "the perturbation also propagates further both upstream and downstream for larger values of @xmath46 . for the turbulence moving back into the ejecta",
    "this is due to increased pressure and density gradients in the unstable region . for the forward - propagating turbulence , it is due to the fact that the gas is compressed into a thin shell @xmath47 behind the forward shock , and the width of this shell decreases with @xmath46 .",
    "the primary effects of the rayleigh - taylor instability on the shock dynamics are displayed in figure [ fig:1d2d ] .",
    "this is a snapshot of the shockwave at @xmath43 for @xmath48 .",
    "we show the radial profile and compare it with the same calculation performed in 1d assuming spherical symmetry . in the 1d case , we see the standard two - shock solution which has been extensively used to describe grb phenomenology .    from this figure , the most obvious distinction between one and two dimensions is the complete disruption of the contact discontinuity in 2d , which of course is expected since it is the contact discontinuity which is unstable .",
    "the second plainly visible distinction here is in the reverse shock .",
    "clearly in the 2d case , the instability has managed to perturb the reverse shock , and this has altered the shock s characteristic speed . in the 2d case , the reverse shock propagates much further back than in 1d .",
    "this apparently does not happen to the forward shock , as it remains undisturbed .",
    "it is possible that this conclusion could be challenged by a three dimensional calculation , but we do not expect this to be the case , as the instability would dissipate more efficiently in 3d .",
    "characteristic waves are shown in figure [ fig : shockpos ] , where we compare 1d and 2d shock dynamics . here",
    "again , we can see important effects of the instability : what was a contact discontinuity becomes smeared over a larger region in 2d , overtaking the reverse shock but leaving the forward shock alone .",
    "we can compare different values of @xmath46 on a similar footing by expressing the positions of characteristic waves in terms of the self - similarity parameter , @xmath49 we plot the value of @xmath50 for all characteristic waves in figure [ fig : chi ] for @xmath51 and @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath52 , the characteristic waves approach constant values of @xmath50 . from these three examples , it appears that the forward position of the rayleigh - taylor fingers approaches a value of @xmath53 which is independent of @xmath46 .",
    "we might expect from this that turbulence should be present in about one third of the energy behind the shock , though in practice we find this fraction is closer to 10% .",
    "this is the percentage which is turbulent and therefore magnetized by rayleigh - taylor ( we calculate the magnetization in  [",
    "sec : turb ] ) .",
    "after @xmath33 , the shock moves away from the fingers quickly and have no further impact on the forward shock dynamics .",
    "it will be useful to measure the kinetic energy of large eddies in the turbulent region of the solution , since that will provide insight into the turbulent cascade which would take place in a highly - resolved 3d calculation .",
    "it turns out that the relevant quantity , the turbulent energy fraction , @xmath54 can be measured in a relatively simple manner . in our analysis , we have converted 2d data into 1d data by averaging in a conservative way .",
    "that is , for a given radial annulus , the total mass , energy , and momentum of that annulus are calculated , and from these quantities the conservatively averaged density , pressure , and four velocity are determined ( this is how the middle panels of figure [ fig:1d2d ] were generated ) .",
    "we note that this averaging process typically results in a slightly larger pressure than would result from arithmetically averaging the pressure by volume on an annulus .",
    "this is because when the momentum of an annulus is calculated , there is cancellation due to the variations in velocity with angle , and this  lost \" kinetic energy is interpreted as thermal energy in the averaged quantities .    in other words ,",
    "the excess of thermal energy from averaging conservatively over angle is exactly the turbulent kinetic energy contained in that annulus .",
    "this provides a very simple means of calculating the fraction of energy in large eddies : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the difference between  conservatively averaged \" pressure and volume - averaged pressure .",
    "we have plotted a snapshot of @xmath57 in the lower panel of figure [ fig:1d2d ] .",
    "there is clearly variation with radius , but in this snapshot it roughly peaks around @xmath58 . for the three cases studied ,",
    "this turbulent fraction peaks at time @xmath59 with this same peak value , roughly independent of @xmath46 .",
    "this turbulent energy is free to cascade to smaller scales ( as it would in a 3d calculation ) and to amplify magnetic fields ( as it would if magnetic fields were included in our calculation ) .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to estimate the saturated magnetic energy fraction , because it has been shown @xcite that it is roughly in equipartition with the turbulent kinetic energy :    @xmath60    this is the magnetization induced by rayleigh - taylor alone , though magnetic fields could be amplified by other mechanisms .",
    "we have calculated light curves in one and two dimensions , in order to explore the observational consequences of the instability .",
    "relativistic doppler effects are responsible for the hard gamma - ray and x - ray afterglow emission , but the reverse shock generally has a much lower lorentz factor than the forward shock , so it can not compete with the forward shock at high frequencies . at lower frequencies ( optical , microwave , radio ) the flux from the forward and reverse shocks can be comparable , so in these wavelengths we search for observational signatures of the rayleigh - taylor instability .    by implementing a simple model for synchrotron emission directly into the hydrodynamical evolution , we calculate a microwave light curve for our @xmath61 model .",
    "we calculate the flux from a given computational zone at a given observer time from the formula : @xmath62 where the magnetic energy is assumed to be proportional to the thermal energy , @xmath63 and frequency dependence assumes  slow cooling \" @xmath64 where we choose p = 2.5 , and where @xmath65 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency , @xmath66 this is a simplified version of the emission model in @xcite .",
    "we show the light curve in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] for @xmath61 .",
    "to single out signatures of rayleigh - taylor , we compare 1d and 2d results .",
    "the forward shock emission is unaffected , as the forward shock is not perturbed by the instability .",
    "the reverse shock emission is affected by the instability ; the peak magnitude is not diminished significantly , but the peak occurs at a later time in 2d than in 1d .",
    "we have computed the development and saturation of rayleigh - taylor instability in relativistic fireballs using a moving computational mesh .",
    "the instability does not perturb the forward shock , but it completely disrupts the contact discontinuity between the ejecta and the surrounding medium , and it significantly modifies the dynamics of the reverse shock , which may cause reverse shock emission to peak at a later time . the relativistic shear flow generated by rayleigh - taylor fingers",
    "may also provide a site for cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability is effective in stirring up turbulence ; we find that turbulent kinetic energy reaches about 1% of thermal energy wherever the turbulence is present , which should rapidly amplify magnetic fields up to 1% of thermal by the operation of small - scale dynamo @xcite during the deceleration phase ( between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the turbulence is present in a region behind the forward shock , but rayleigh - taylor fingers attempt to reach out towards this shock , penetrating about 10% of its energy .",
    "the reverse shock is impacted immediately , and it is pushed away from the forward shock , strengthening it and causing its emission to be observed at a later time .",
    "this motivates 3d calculations , as these numbers might change when 3d turbulence effects are taken into account .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of accounting for fluid instabilities when considering the dynamics and observational signatures of gamma ray bursts .",
    "figure [ fig:1d2d ] gives some hope that an effective 1d description of the dynamics may be possible ; adding some kind of diffusive term in 1d to shocked fluid elements in the ejecta , for example , might reproduce physical profiles close to those in figure [ fig:1d2d ] .",
    "this motivates a more comprehensive study which includes more general circumburst profiles , larger lorentz factors ( converged results with @xmath67 or higher are much more computationally intensive but certainly possible ) , and potentially 3d turbulence effects . because of scale invariance , our only free parameter is @xmath46 , the characteristic lorentz factor .",
    "the dynamics and synchrotron emission both can be re - scaled to arbitrary explosion energy and circumburst density , which means that a suite of calculations for different values of @xmath46 will completely cover the parameter space of all such explosions @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to implement a detailed synchrotron emission model @xcite , to perform a comprehensive study of emission from grb outflows .",
    "all of this is planned as future work .",
    "resources supporting this work were provided by the nasa high - end computing ( hec ) program through the nasa advanced supercomputing ( nas ) division at ames research center .",
    "we are grateful to jonathan zrake for helpful comments and discussions ."
