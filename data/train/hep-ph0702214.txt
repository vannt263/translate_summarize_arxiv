    "the radiative decays of @xmath6 meson into a single photon and a pair of neutral pseudoscalar mesons are valuable sources of information in hadron physics",
    ". these days can provide insight into the structure and the properties of low - mass scalar resonances .",
    "in particular , the radiative decay @xmath0 where the scalar resonances @xmath1 and @xmath2 are known to provide the dominant contribution to the amplitude allows for a direct measurement of the couplings of the @xmath7 system to @xmath8 and @xmath9 scalar resonances and thus it can yield information on the properties of these scalar resonances .",
    "moreover , the study of the radiative decay process @xmath10 is important because it provides a background to the reaction @xmath11 .",
    "this latter process was proposed as a way to study cp violation and measuring the ratio @xmath12 @xcite . since this involves seeking for very small effects , if the branching ratio of the decay @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath13 , or more precisely if @xmath14 , then this background decay @xmath0 will limit the scope of cp violation measurements in @xmath11 decay at da@xmath15ne .",
    "therefore , the study of the reaction @xmath10 and the calculation of the branching ratio @xmath16 is crutial for the measurements of cp violation and small cp violating parameters in @xmath11 decay .",
    "the decay @xmath0 was first considered by achasov et al .",
    "@xcite using the one - loop mechanism where the decay proceeds through the chain of reactions as @xmath17 .",
    "they noted the negative interference between the contributions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances , and they obtained the value @xmath20 for the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay for some set of @xmath18 and @xmath19 masses and the values of the coupling constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the radiative @xmath6-meson decays , among other radiative decay processes of the type @xmath23 , where v and p belong to the lowest multiplets of vector ( v ) and pseudoscalar ( p ) mesons , were studied by bramon et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) mechanism using standard lagrangians obeying su(3)-symmetry . in this framework",
    ", the radiative @xmath0 reaction proceeds through the decay chains @xmath24 where the intermediate vector mesons are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they obtained the branching ratio for the decay as @xmath27 .",
    "bramon et al .",
    "@xcite later considered the radiative vector meson decays in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) using chiral effective lagrangians enlarged to include on - shell vector mesons , and they calculated the branching ratios for various decays of type @xmath28 at the one - loop level , including both @xmath29 and @xmath7 intermediate loops . in this approach the decay @xmath0 proceeds through charged - kaon loops , and they obtained the contribution of charged - kaon loops to the branching ratio as @xmath30 .",
    "they concluded that due to smallness of the vmd contribution , this decay is dominated by charged - kaon loops .",
    "an additional contribution to the decay of the type @xmath28 is provided by the amplitude involving scalar mesons as an intermediate state .",
    "these radiative decays were studied by marko et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of unitarized chiral perturbation theory .",
    "they used the techniques of chiral unitary theory developed earlier to include the final state interactions of two pseudoscalars by summing the pseudoscalar loops through the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "a review is given by oller et al .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the scalar resonances are generated dynamically by utilizing the one - loop pseudoscalar amplitudes .",
    "the reaction @xmath0 was studied by oller @xcite within this framework .",
    "the amplitude of this radiative decay has contributions coming from the scalar mesons @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and oller obtained for the branching ratio the value @xmath33 .",
    "the radiative vector meson decays @xmath28 were also studied using linear sigma model ( l@xmath34 m ) , which is a @xmath35 chiral model that incorporates the pseudoscalar and scalar meson nonets @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath0 was studied within the framework of l@xmath34 m by escribano @xcite who obtained the result @xmath36 .    in this work , we attempt to calculate the branching ratio @xmath16 using a phenomenological approach employed earlier in the studies of radiative @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite decays . in our calculation",
    "we use the kaon - loop model @xcite where the initial vector meson @xmath6 decays into a pair of charged kaons , which after the emission of a photon couple to the neutral kaon pair @xmath39 through the scalar resonances @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , we consider the vertices involving the scalar mesons as point like , therefore the effects of the structure are reflected in the coupling constants .",
    "the mechanism of the radiative decay process @xmath10 in the kaon - loop model is provided by the reactions @xmath40 where the last reaction proceeds by a two - step mechanism with the charged - kaon loop coupling to the final @xmath41 state through the scalar resonance @xmath31 or @xmath32 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the processes contributing to the @xmath0 amplitude diagramatically where the diagram in fig .",
    "1(c ) results from the minimal coupling for gauge invariance .",
    "we do not make any assumption about the structure of the scalar mesons @xmath42 or @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the @xmath6 meson and the scalar mesons @xmath18 and @xmath19 both couple strongly to the @xmath43 system , we therefore describe the @xmath44 and @xmath45 vertices phenomenologically by effective lagrangians .",
    "the @xmath44 vertex in the diagrams shown in fig . 1 is described by the phenomenological lagrangian    @xmath46    we utilize the experimental value for the branching ratio @xmath47 @xcite and determine the coupling constant @xmath48 as @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 vertex , where s denotes the scalar meson @xmath18 or @xmath19 , is described by the phenomenological lagrangian @xmath51 which is usually considered to define the coupling constant @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "similarly , we describe the @xmath53 vertex by the effective lagrangian @xmath54 furthermore , isotopic spin invariance implies that the coupling constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related by the equations @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite . in our approach",
    "we assume isotopic spin invariance and use the coupling constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfying this requirement .",
    "these coupling constants have been determined by theoretical calculations and from experimental analysis . in our phenomenological calculation",
    "we use the values of these coupling constants which are determined from the experimental studies of the radiative decay processes @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we then obtain the amplitude for the radiative decay reaction @xmath0 following from the diagrams shown in fig . 1 as @xmath61 i(a , b ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~~\\times { \\cal m}(k^+k^-\\rightarrow k^0\\overline{k}^0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the polarizations and four - momenta of the @xmath6 meson and the photon , respectively . the invariant function i(a , b ) has been calculated in different contexts @xcite , and it is given by @xmath64 + \\frac{a}{(a - b)^{2}}\\left [ g\\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\right)-g\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\right ] \\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath65^{2}~ , & ~~x>\\frac{1}{4 } \\\\ \\frac{1}{4}\\left [ \\ln ( \\frac{\\eta_{+}}{\\eta_{-}})-i\\pi\\right ] ^{2}~ , & ~~x<\\frac{1}{4 }              \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the amplitude @xmath70 contains the scalar @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances and in the approach we adopted it is given by @xmath71    since the scalar resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 are unstable and they have a finite lifetime we use breit - wigner propagators with an energy dependent width for these resonances .",
    "we therefore in the scalar meson propagator make the replacement @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74\\left[1-\\frac{(m_{\\pi^0}-m_\\eta)^2}{q^2}\\right ] } } { \\sqrt{\\left[1-\\frac{(m_{\\pi^0}+m_\\eta)^2}{m_{a_0}^2}\\right]\\left[1-\\frac{(m_{\\pi^0}-m_\\eta)^2}{m_{a_0}^2}\\right]}}~ \\theta(\\sqrt{q^2}-(m_{\\pi^0}+m_\\eta))~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we use the experimental values for the widths @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite in the above expressions . then the differential decay probability for the radiative decay @xmath0 for an unpolarized @xmath6 meson at rest",
    "is given as @xmath77 where e@xmath78 and e@xmath79 are the photon and @xmath80 meson energies respectively .",
    "we perform an average over the spin states of @xmath6 meson and a sum over the polarization states of the photon .",
    "the decay width @xmath0 is then obtained by integration @xmath81 where the minimum photon energy is e@xmath82 and the maximum photon energy is given as @xmath83 .",
    "the maximum and minimum values for the energy e@xmath79 of @xmath80 meson are given by @xmath84",
    "the branching ratios @xmath85 and @xmath86 are listed as @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the particle physics data tables @xcite .",
    "achasov @xcite showed in detail that the existing data on radiative @xmath6 meson decays support the charged - kaon loop mechanism for @xmath85 and @xmath89 radiative decay reactions . from the above branching ratios within the framework of charged - kaon loop mechanism for these decays we determine the coupling constants @xmath90 as @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev . using these values for the coupling constants and the values of the relevant masses taken from the particle physics data tables @xcite ,",
    "if we include the contribution of @xmath18 resonance only in the decay mechanism of the radiative decay @xmath0 , we obtain the result for the branching ratio as @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the contribution of @xmath19 resonance is considered only the branching ratio is @xmath94 .",
    "since both @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances make a contribution to the decay @xmath0 , when considering their contribution to the decay rate we have to note that the amplitudes involving @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances interfere destructively due to isotopic spin invariance as reflected in the relations between the coupling constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus , if we consider that the interference between the contributions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances is destructive , we obtain for the branching ratio the value @xmath95 , which is somewhat higher than the previous estimations .",
    "however , it is small enough , we therefore conclude that this reaction will not provide a significant background to the measurements of @xmath96 decay for testing cp violation .    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the distribution @xmath97 for the radiative decay @xmath0 in the phenomenological approach that we adopted , where we also indicate the contributions coming from @xmath18 resonance , @xmath19 resonances , and the contribution resulting from the destructive interference of these mechanisms for the coupling constants used above .",
    "furthermore , in fig .",
    "3 , we show the photon spectrum @xmath98 for the process @xmath0 for the same amplitudes as in fig .",
    "2 .    we note , however , that our result for the branching ratio @xmath16 depends sensitively on the values of the coupling constants @xmath99 and the masses @xmath100 of the scalar resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we , therefore , repeat our calculation using the values of the coupling constants @xmath52 and the masses @xmath100 determined by different experimental groups by performing fits to their data of the radiative @xmath37 and @xmath60 decays .",
    "snd collaboration @xcite obtained the values @xmath101 mev , @xmath102 , @xmath103 mev , @xmath104 from their fit to snd data considering @xmath18 and @xmath34 mixing .",
    "if we use these values , we obtain the results @xmath105 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "they also performed a fit to their data without @xmath18 and @xmath34 mixing in which case they obtained @xmath108 mev , @xmath109 , @xmath110 mev and @xmath111 . using these values in our calculation",
    "give the branching ratios @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "achasov et al .",
    "@xcite also calculated the branching ratio for the decay @xmath0 using the above sets of parameters describing the snd data @xcite , and for the first set they obtained @xmath115 while for the second set their result was @xmath116 .",
    "kloe collaboration at the da@xmath15ne collider also studied the decays @xmath37 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "they performed two different fits in order to measure the parameters of the scalar states . in the first fit",
    ", they included the contribution of a possible broad scalar @xmath34 state as well as the intermediate @xmath31 state interfering destructively in the analysis of the data of the @xmath37 reaction . in the second fit only the contribution of the intermediate @xmath31 state was considered . in the first case they obtained @xmath117 mev , @xmath118 and in the second case @xmath119 mev ,",
    "they also reported the values @xmath121 mev , @xmath122 .",
    "if we use the values of the coupling constants @xmath99 and the masses @xmath100 that the kloe collaboration obtained in the first fit , we obtain the results @xmath123 and @xmath124 and @xmath125 . on the other hand , using the values they obtained in their second fit without considering the contribution of intermediate @xmath34 state in our calculation results in the branching ratios @xmath126 and @xmath127 and @xmath128 . however , it was pointed out by achasov et al .",
    "@xcite that the kloe data also allow @xmath129 @xcite and @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "if we employ these values of the coupling constants with the values of the masses @xmath131 , @xmath132 and in these analyses @xcite in our calculation we obtained the results @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .    we can",
    ", therefore , conclude that within the formalism we consider in this work the branching ratio @xmath136 of the radiative decay @xmath10 is small enough so that this decay will not cause any serious background problem for the studies of cp violation in the @xmath11 decay .",
    "other effects such as structure @xcite and the finite widths of scalars @xcite on the radiative @xmath6 decays have also been investigated .",
    "oller @xcite showed that the inclusion of these contribution does not change the conclusions of the charged - kaon loop model .",
