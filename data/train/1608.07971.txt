    "an important motivation in the search for a quantum theory of gravity is the resolution of the singularities present in generic solutions to classical general relativity",
    ". of particular interest in this context is the big bang singularity , which is intimately connected to the conditions at the beginning of the universe .",
    "consequently the question of singularity resolution is related to that of the initial conditions in quantum gravity .    in @xcite ,",
    "hartle and hawking ( hh ) proposed an extremely elegant definition for an initial state for canonical quantum gravity , @xmath0 : = \\int_{d(q_{ab } ) }   \\mathcal{d}[g]\\ : e^{-s_e[g]}.\\ ] ] this proposal is within the adm approach to quantum gravity , i.e. , states are wave functions of the spatial metric @xmath1 .",
    "the integration domain @xmath2 of the path integral contains all smooth euclidean 4-metrics on a compact manifold with boundary , such that the metric on the boundary is @xmath1 .",
    "the weighting factor is given by the euclidean action @xmath3 , and the over - counting due to diffeomorphism - related metrics is taken care of by the path integral measure @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "this state satisfies the constraints of canonical quantum gravity , in particular the wheeler - de witt equation , in a formal sense .",
    "while it is hard to go beyond formal considerations in the full theory due to the difficulties involved with defining the path integral , the no boundary proposal is amenable to analytic and numerical treatment in the case of quantum cosmology and has been studied there in great detail , see @xcite and the references therein , for example .",
    "some more recent developments are in @xcite .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a canonical approach to the quantization of gravity , making use of an extension of the adm phase space that is embedded in the phase space of su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "while the issue of singularity resolution is not settled in full generality in lqg , there are many indications that the quantum theory does resolve the singularities of gr . for example , there are indications that the big bang singularity is replaced by a bounce from a minimal scale factor .    this still leaves the question of what the appropriate initial state is in lqg .",
    "it has started to become relevant in loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a large class of initial states is compatible with observations , @xcite , but that details of the initial state may nevertheless be probed by future observations @xcite .",
    "this is our primary motivation to come back to the hh proposal and study its applicability in lqg .",
    "the definition of the hartle - hawking state is intimately tied to the adm formulation of gravity . since different variables are used in loop quantum gravity , the translation of the proposal is non - trivial .",
    "we investigate various straightforward possibilities , but find that none of the resulting states satisfies the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we finally partially specify a state that does satisfy the constraint at least formally .",
    "the proposed state differs in important respects from the original proposal by hartle and hawking , so that its physical and mathematical viability has to be considered from scratch .",
    "we start work in this direction by considering cosmological models .",
    "since the difficulties in translating the hh proposal are somewhat surprising at first sight , we also study the situation in a toy model : the free relativistic particle .",
    "we should point out that path integrals for quantum cosmology in the lqg context have been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "there the main object of study is the _ extraction kernel _ , which in adm variables would read @xmath5 : = \\int_{d(q^{(1)}_{ab},q^{(2)}_{ab } ) }   \\mathcal{d}[g]\\ : e^{is [ g]}.\\ ] ] it can be considered the analogue to the propagator in a theory in which the canonical hamiltonian is a constraint . in this case",
    "the underlying manifold has a boundary consisting of two disjoint pieces , and the integration domain @xmath6 is defined by prescribing the geometries on those pieces . in @xcite , the projector on the kernel of the quantum constraint",
    "is investigated in detail in the cosmological setting .",
    "it is shown that it has a feynman - like path integral representation , with an action that carries quantum corrections .",
    "the present work is much more formal than @xcite in that we do not start from the mathematically rigorous hilbert space underlying lqg , and consequently , we will work with the classical action , and not consider quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , extrapolation from the properties of the usual propagator for particles in quantum theory suggests that the extraction kernel is not a natural ground state in any sense .",
    "we should finally point out that an interesting proposal that carries some formal similarities to the hartle - hawking state has been put forward in the spin foam formulation of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the precise relation to the states considered in the present work is not clear , however .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section [ sec_adm ] we review the work of hartle - hawking and give a precise meaning of what their proposal entails in adm variables . in section [ sec_ab ] , we try to translate this proposal in the context of loop quantum gravity and see that all straightforward proposals fail . in section [ sec_new ]",
    ", we make a new proposal for an initial state that does satisfy the constraint equations of loop quantum gravity .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_lqc ] , we apply this new state to ( spatially flat ) loop quantum cosmological models and perform a saddle point approximation .",
    "we finish this article with a summary and an outlook on future research directions . in an appendix",
    ", we consider the case of a relativistic particle as a toy model in order to see the difficulties that arise in proposing an initial state .",

    "the proposal by hartle and hawking @xcite for the initial state of geometry is based on the adm formalism @xcite .",
    "it involves a foliation of spacetime into spatial slices diffeomorphic to a 3d manifold @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the boundary is spacelike , and that the foliation is adapted to the boundary in the sense that the boundary is given by one of the slices . in adapted coordinates the metric takes the form @xmath22 @xmath23 is the lapse function , @xmath24 is the shift , @xmath25 is the 3-metric on @xmath21 and @xmath11 is the signature of spacetime , with @xmath26 for lorentzian and @xmath27 for euclidean signature . with this split",

    "wave functions are thus functionals of 3-metrics , and the operators @xmath47=q_{ab}(x)\\psi[q ] , \\qquad \\widehat{p}^{ab}(x)\\psi[q]=\\frac{1}{i}\\,\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta { q}_{ab}(x)}\\psi[q].\\ ] ] are assumed to be self - adjoint and fulfil the canonical commutation relations . here , and in this article , we set @xmath48 .",

    "the argument to show proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , one can express @xmath51 in terms of the adm variables @xmath1 , @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and use the action in adm form , @xmath52=\\int_{d(q_{ab } ) }   \\mathcal{d}q'_{ab}\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ : e^{-s_e[q'_{ab},n^a , n]}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is now a domain in the space of adm variables that enforces the boundary conditions as before . upon the natural assumption that the measure @xmath53 is uniform under arbitrary translations in the space of lapse functions , @xmath54}&=\\left .",

    "the second step consists in showing that the quantum _ lorentzian _ hamiltonian constraint turns into the classical _ euclidean _ hamiltonian constraint under the path integral , @xmath57=\\int_{{d}(q_{ab } ) }    \\mathcal{d}q'_{ab}\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ : h_e(x)\\:e^{-s_e[q'_{ab},n^a , n]}.\\ ] ] let us first consider the action of @xmath58 on @xmath59 .",
    "formally @xmath60 therefore the action of @xmath58 on @xmath59 will insert @xmath61 , as well as @xmath62 and several more terms under the path integral .",
    "the @xmath62 term can be eliminated by a judicious choice of the discretization used in the definition of the path integral : @xmath63 where @xmath64 . as for the poisson bracket in , it can be eliminated by adding a suitable boundary term .",
    "if this is not done , functional derivatives of the state @xmath59 will not commute , and hence the canonical commutation relations will not be fulfilled . another way to say",
    "this is that without the elimination of the additional term , the state is not functionally differentiable . in the following",
    "we assume that this has been accomplished .",
    "then we obtain the simple result @xmath65=\\int_{{d}(q_{ab } ) }    \\mathcal{d}q'_{ab}\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ :   ip^{ab}(x)\\:e^{-s_e[q'_{ab},n^a , n]}.\\ ] ] now one can show : @xmath66 & = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{det(\\widehat{q})}}\\left[\\widehat{q}_{ac}\\widehat{q}_{bd}-\\frac{1}{2}\\widehat{q}_{ab}\\widehat{q}_{cd}\\right]\\widehat{p}^{ab}\\widehat{p}^{cd}\\,-\\,\\sqrt{det(\\widehat{q})}\\,\\widehat{r}^{(3)}\\right)\\:\\int_{d(q ) } \\mathcal{d}[g]\\ : e^{-s_e[g]}\\\\ & = \\int_{d(q)}\\mathcal{d}[g]\\left[-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{det({q})}}\\left[{q}_{ac}{q}_{bd}-\\frac{1}{2}{q}_{ab}{q}_{cd}\\right]{p}^{ab}{p}^{cd}\\,+\\,\\sqrt{det({q})}\\,{r}^{(3)}\\right)\\right]\\ : e^{-s_e[g]}\\label{eq22}\\\\ & = \\int_{d(q)}\\mathcal{d}[g]\\:h_e\\:e^{-s_e[g]}.\\label{eq23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that there is a combination of sign factors that lead to this result : on the one hand , @xmath67 goes to @xmath68 under the path integral . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath69 term in the hamilton constraint comes with a factor @xmath11 and thus changes sign .",
    "we will see momentarily that such a combination of signs does not take place when using connection variables for gravity .    a calculation similar to",
    "the one above shows that @xmath70=0.\\ ] ] in this case , no fortuitous combinations of signs is necessary to reach the result .",
    "given the construction outlined in the last section , it is a natural question to ask whether an analogous state can be defined for loop quantum gravity , at least at the formal level .",
    "we will see that this is a non - trivial question , and that the most natural way to generalize the construction to the variables used in lqg results in a state that does not satisfy the constraints in a formal sense .",
    "lqg starts from ashtekar variables @xcite in their real form @xcite .",
    "these embed the gravity phase space into the phase space of su(2 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "we use the conventions and results of @xcite .",
    "the set of variables are the electric field @xmath71 and the _ ashtekar - barbero connection _",

    "gauss constraint_. this constraint arises as an extra feature of the theory due to the internal su(2 ) gauge group which generates gauge transformations on the phase space . in finding the expression for the holst action analogous to",
    ", we have freely added boundary terms to the original action , to be able to carry out the required partial integrations .",
    "we want to construct a ground state function which mimics the properties of the hh - state . before doing so",
    ", we are faced with a choice of the variable that needs to be considered in defining the initial state : we could fix the connection @xmath84 or the electric field @xmath85 on the boundary @xmath8 .",
    "hartle s and hawking s construction could be generalized in two ways : by focusing on the fact that @xmath1 on the boundary defines its _ intrinsic geometry _ , or by focusing on its role as _ canonical position _ variable .",
    "the former would lead to a wave function of @xmath85 , the latter to one of @xmath84 . in fact , in the latter case , a simple canonical transformation would make @xmath85 the canonical position variable . for a linear system such as a harmonic oscillator , these two choices can be related by a fourier transform , but this is an artefact of the simple nature of the system , and does no longer hold for gravity .",
    "finally , there could be the possibility of using the original state in a construction of a ground state for lqg , as in @xmath86:=\\psi_{\\text{hh}}[q(e)].\\ ] ] we will now deal with all of these possibilities one by one .",
    "we will see that for each of these possibilities , the resulting state does not satisfy the ( lorentzian ) hamiltonian constraint .",
    "since this difficulty is somewhat surprising , we also study the situation in a toy model , the free relativistic particle , in an appendix .",
    "the result is the same .      following the hamiltonian formulation and considering the fact that the role these two variables play is analogous to the position and momentum variables , we start out by defining the state in terms of the connection .",

    "these histories form a set @xmath93 . here we assume , as in the adm case , that the only boundary of the manifold is @xmath21 , and that @xmath84 and @xmath94 are smooth ( `` no boundary condition '' ) .",
    "we will not explore what this actually means for the form on @xmath84 , as we will see that serious problems already arise at a more elementary level .",
    "hence we tentatively define the quantum state as @xmath95 : = \\int_{d(a ) }   \\mathcal{d}a'\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ : e^{-s_e[a',n^a , n]}.\\ ] ] with the same arguments as in the adm case , one can show that @xmath96}=0.\\ ] ] also , with the same arguments as in the adm case , we can assume @xmath97=\\int_{d(a ) }    \\mathcal{d}a'\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ : ie^a_k(x)\\ , e^{-s_e[a',n^a , n]}.\\ ] ] to find the action of the hamiltonian constraint , note first that the extrinsic curvature in terms of the spin connection as : @xmath98 @xmath99 is a complicated function of @xmath100 , but this function is rational and homogeneous of degree 0 , i.e. , it is invariant under scaling of @xmath100 @xcite .",

    "unlike in the adm case , a term remains under the integral .",
    "this term does not seem to be a simple function of the constraints .",
    "in particular the form of the term is very different from the expressions for the gauss and diffeomorphism constraints in and , respectively , and we have found no argument why it should have a vanishing integral . therefore we conclude that @xmath59 defined in this way _ does not _ solve the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "an interesting check of the formal calculations is given by applying the same reasoning to the extraction amplitude in terms of ashtekar - barbero variables @xmath104 : = \\int_{d(a ) } \\mathcal{d}a'\\ : e^{is[a']}.\\ ] ] here one finds that applying @xmath105 , @xmath106 to the state results in @xmath107 where it is understood that the operator on the left of the arrow results in the function on the right , inserted under the path integral .",
    "it is then obvious that @xmath108=0 , \\qquad \\widehat{h}_a \\psi [ a]=0\\ ] ] holds as it should  both , for the euclidean and for the lorentzian case .",
    "we may also choose to define the ground state wave function as a functional of the field @xmath85 .",
    "in this case , to make the analogy with the construction by hartle and hawking as strong as possible , we can regard @xmath85 as the position variable , i.e. , work with the canonical pair @xmath109 .",
    "then the appropriate formal quantization is given by @xmath110 with @xmath111 a space of su(2 ) electric fields on @xmath21 and @xmath46 a uniform measure on this space .",

    "again , in the present exploratory work , we will stay on the formal level .",
    "the candidate state is given by @xmath86=\\int_{d(e ) }   \\mathcal{d}e'\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ : e^{-s_e[e',n^a , n]}.\\ ] ] where the integral is now over histories @xmath113 that have a common boundary value @xmath114 .",
    "these histories form a set @xmath115 . here",
    "we assume again , as in the adm case , that the only boundary of the manifold is @xmath21 , and that @xmath85 and @xmath116 are regular , smooth , and give compact spacetimes ( `` no boundary condition '' ) .",
    "this condition is actually very close in spirit to the original no - boundary condition of hartle and hawking , since @xmath117 describes a 4d euclidean geometry .",
    "now we can proceed as in the previous section and evaluate the action of the basic operators , and ultimately of the hamilton and diffeomorphism constraint . by adding suitable boundary term , the action of @xmath105 on @xmath59 is well defined and given by @xmath118=\\int_{d(e ) }    \\mathcal{d}e\\,\\mathcal{d}n^a\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ : ia_a^k(x)\\ , e^{-s_e[e , n^a , n]}.\\ ] ] then the action of the hamilton constraint becomes @xmath119 with @xmath120 the term proportional to @xmath103 integrates to zero , but the additional terms have no reason to vanish .",
    "again there are no obvious combinations of the constraints .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath59 defined in this way _ does not _ solve the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we note that in this case , there is also a problem with the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "it will result in a term proportional to @xmath121 under the integral that does not vanish .",
    "we note as a consistency check that also in the case of the wave functions of @xmath85 , for a state that is of the type of the extraction amplitude , we have @xmath107 whence all the constraints are satisfied .",
    "finally , we use the original hh - state in a construction of a candidate ground state for ashtekar - barbero variables .",
    "a plausible candidate is @xmath86:=\\psi_{\\text{hh}}[q(e)]\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that the 3-metric @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of @xmath85 .",
    "we see no a priori reason why this state should satisfy the constraint , but we will check for reasons of completeness .",
    "we notice that @xmath123 is a many - to - one function , but this is no problem",
    ". the state would just be constant along gauge orbits .",
    "since this state is naturally a functional of @xmath71 , we would be in the setting of the previous section , in particular @xmath106 would act as a multiplication operator , and @xmath105 as derivative , as in .",
    "in particular , @xmath124 we need to understand how @xmath105 acts on @xmath59 .",
    "we find @xmath125&=\\frac{i}{2}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta e^a_k}\\psi_{\\text{hh}}[q(e)]\\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{2i } \\frac{\\delta q_{bc}(e)}{\\delta e_k^a } \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta q_{bc } } \\psi_{\\text{hh}}[q]\\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta q_{bc}(e)}{\\delta e_k^a } \\widehat{p}^{bc}\\psi_{\\text{hh}}[q]\\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta q_{bc}(e)}{\\delta e_k^a } \\int_{{d}(q_{bc } ) }    \\mathcal{d}q'\\,\\mathcal{d}n^d\\,\\mathcal{d}n\\ :   ip^{bc}(x)\\:e^{-s_e[q',n^d , n]}\\label{eq_eaction}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using explicit expressions in @xcite , we replace @xmath126 with appropriate expression in terms of ashtekar variables , which brings the right hand side of to the form @xmath127\\,\\left[|det(e^c_l)|^{-1}e^a_k e^d_k k^j_{[d } \\delta^b_{c ] } e^c_j\\right]\\,e^{-s_e[g]}.\\label{eq45}\\ ] ] in order to obtain @xmath128 , we use the relation @xmath129 .",
    "however , irrespective of what @xmath128 would turn out to be , a look at the integrand in indicates that we would have to replace the extrinsic curvature and rewrite it in terms of @xmath130 and @xmath131 by using , where @xmath131 is again written in terms of triads and inverse triads .",
    "this replacement will turn the integrand into a really complicated expression , and we found no way to combine everything to obtain the euclidean hamiltonian constraint @xmath103 of lqg under the path integral .",
    "hence we strongly suspect that the constraint is again not satisfied .",
    "in the previous section , we investigated a number of ways to translate the hh - proposal as directly as possible to ashtekar - barbero variables .",
    "however , all formal states obtained in this way failed to solve the hamilton constraint .",
    "thus , to obtain a viable candidate state , it appears that we have to stay less close to the original proposal .",
    "we make the following observation : the reason the state did not satisfy the hamiltonian constraint is because of the mismatch between the lorentzian constraint operator , and the euclidean constraint that is needed under the path integral . in the adm case",

    "the dependence of the constraint on the signature is more complicated , and does not coincide with a simple scaling of the momentum .",
    "this caused the extra term to pop up due to the particular placement of the signature of the manifold in the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "if we did not want this sign change and if we had instead started with a lorentzian action , then the formal argument of hartle - hawking would simply follow through and the hamiltonian constraint ( along with other constraints ) would be satisfied .",
    "this observation therefore leads us to define a new initial state as follows : @xmath133:=\\int_{d(a)}\\mathcal{d}a'\\:e^{-s_l[a']}\\ ] ] where we have simply replaced euclidean action @xmath134 $ ] in by the lorentzian action @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "the first check that needs to be done is to perform the formal calculation again that would confirm that this indeed satisfies the constraints . to this end , note that we are in the setting of section [ se_psiofa ] .",
    "we thus have @xmath136 furthermore , we had already seen in section [ se_psiofa ] that @xmath137 putting everything together , we obtain @xmath138\\frac{\\epsilon_{jkl}\\widehat{e}^a_k \\widehat{e}^b_l}{\\sqrt{det(\\widehat{q } ) } } \\leadsto -\\sqrt{i}\\,h_l .\\ ] ] thus we see that the modified hartle - hawking state in vanishes under the path integral , implying that the state _ does satisfy _ the lorentzian hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the same holds for gauge and diffeomorphism constraint , since @xmath139 thus the new state fullfills the minimum requirements .",
    "one immediate question is regarding the precise definition of the domain @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the histories describe , albeit in an indirect way , a lorentzian geometry . therefore there can not be compact spacetime histories that have no boundaries beyond @xmath21 and are regular .",
    "we will not decide on a replacement of the no - boundary condition at this point , but note that it makes the present proposal somewhat incomplete and less natural than the original one .",
    "to get a feeling for the physics implied by the new state , we will consider it in the context of quantum cosmology in the following section .",
    "the hartle - hawking state is a formal state for the full theory of quantum gravity .",
    "since it is formally defined by a complicated path integral , it is hard to use it for any kind of concrete calculation . to simplify things",
    ", one can reduce the number of degrees of freedom , by just considering a symmetric sector of gr with finitely many degrees of freedom and quantizing the corresponding phase space .",
    "then the hh prescription yields a state that is defined by a quantum mechanical path integral , which is under relatively good control , and detailed calculations become possible .",
    "this was done by hartle , hawking and others for the case of adm variables .",
    "one has to note that here , as in other cases , it is by no means clear that quantization and symmetry reduction commute , even in some approximate sense .",
    "that is , a hh state for a quantization of the cosmological sector of gr is not necessarily close to the state one obtains by restricting the hh state of the full theory to symmetric configurations @xmath1 .    with this proviso , we will now consider cosmology in ashtekar - barbero - like variables .",
    "this is the starting point of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , which is obtained by applying the principles of lqg to cosmological settings .",
    "we use notation and results from @xcite in the following .",
    "we focus our attention to the @xmath140 flrw model with @xmath141 spatial topology . we consider a scalar field @xmath142 minimally coupled to gravity , and a cosmological constant @xmath143 .",
    "a systematic derivation of the hamiltonian framework requires one to introduce a fiducial cell @xmath144 , which we take to be cubical .",
    "let us fix a fiducial metric @xmath145 of signature ( + , + , + ) and let @xmath146 and @xmath147 be the orthonormal frames and co - frames associated with their cartesian coordinates @xmath148 .",
    "the symmetries underlying flrw spacetimes imply that from each equivalence class of gauge related homogeneous , isotropic pairs @xmath149 , we can select one such that @xcite @xmath150 thus one would expect that the gauge invariant information in the canonical pair is captured in just two functions @xmath151 of time .",
    "they are related to the geometrodynamics variables via @xmath152 and @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the scale factor and @xmath155 is the barbero - immirzi parameter of lqg .",
    "it turns out that the equations of connection dynamics in full general relativity are meaningful even when the triad becomes degenerate .",
    "therefore , the phase space of connection dynamics is larger than that of geometrodynamics . in the flrw models , then , we are also led to an enlarged phase space by allowing physical triads to have both orientations and , in addition , to be possibly degenerate . on this full space , @xmath156 , and",
    "@xmath157 if @xmath71 and @xmath146 have the same orientation , @xmath158 if the orientations are opposite , and @xmath159 is @xmath71 is degenerate .",

    ". then @xmath167 are insensitive to the choice of @xmath145 and the poisson bracket between them does not refer to the fiducial metric @xmath145 or to the cell @xmath144 . due to the underlying symmetries and the gauge fixing , only the hamiltonian constraint remains which is now given by : @xmath168",
    "the lorentzian action can be written as @xmath169=\\int \\text{d}t\\;\\left ( \\frac{3}{\\gamma}\\,p\\,\\dot c(t)+p_\\phi\\,\\dot{\\phi}(t ) - n(t ) h_l(t )   \\right)\\ ] ] where we understand @xmath170 as functions of @xmath171 by virtue of the equations of motion .",
    "the gravitational variables @xmath167 are directly related to the basic canonical pair @xmath172 in full lqg and enable one to introduce a quantization procedure in lqc that closely mimics lqg .",
    "we will not use this quantization here , but stay completely formal .",

    "the gist of the method is that the largest contribution to the path integral comes from the stationary points of the action . in our case",

    "@xmath187 may be a complex critical point , but one has to assume that it is a minimum of the real part of @xmath188 . in the case of several critical points , the integral would be approximated by a sum of terms of the same form as the right hand side of .",
    "the approximation is expected to be leading order in @xmath191 , becoming better with @xmath192 .    in our case ,",
    "@xmath187 is subject to boundary conditions .",
    "since we are in the lorentzian domain , there are two boundaries , which we will denote by @xmath132 ( initial ) and @xmath193 ( outgoing ) in the following .",
    "one set of conditions is that @xmath187 has the arguments @xmath194 of the wave function as boundary values at the outgoing slice .",
    "since are the equations of motion , we expect @xmath187 to depend on two more parameters @xmath195 , so @xmath196 we could chose @xmath195 to be further boundary values at the slices @xmath132 or @xmath193 .",
    "the statement is completely formal because one would have to assume some form of functional analyticity of @xmath39 , and there is a priori no definition of @xmath197 that makes sense , since @xmath198 is infinite dimensional . as a consequence , and in the spirit of the entire article , we will be very coarse about the calculation . in particular , we will not check that the critical points we find are minima of the real part , and we will completely drop @xmath197 .",
    "also , at least if written as above , @xmath188 is not analytic in an obvious sense .",
    "as indicated above , the gravitational variables @xmath199 of simplify the solutions of the equations of motion as compared to the variables @xmath171 .",
    "indeed we were unable to obtain an explicit expression of @xmath188 at the critical points for histories @xmath200 .",
    "therefore we will use the variables @xmath201 ) as the coordinates on the space of solutions of the equations of motion , @xmath202 and give an approximation of the state @xmath203 even with these variables , the calculations are somewhat lengthy and will have to be checked by an independent means .    since the result for",
    "nonzero @xmath143 does not seem to be continuous for @xmath204 , we will treat the @xmath205 case separately in the following .      here and in the following ,",
    "we gauge fix the lapse function @xmath23 to @xmath206 . using the hamiltonian constraint from , and using the commutation relations of the scalar field and that of gravitational variables , we compute the expressions for @xmath207 and @xmath208 , which then allows us to write @xmath209 and @xmath210 as @xmath211    at saddle points , the equations of motion hold , in particular the hamilton constraint .",
    "hence the on shell lorentzian action @xmath188 consists only of the boundary term , and using the above expressions , can be expressed as @xmath212 this action , in fact , reduces to zero when we make the following observation : on shell , i.e. , on the constraint surface , the classical hamiltonian constraint becomes an equality which leads to the emergence of the following relation : @xmath213 however , @xmath209 is a constant ( which is an easy check since the constraint does not depend explicitly on @xmath142 implying that @xmath214 ) . as a result , @xmath215 .",
    "this leads to the fact that the action @xmath216 vanishes at the critical points @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , for a flat universe with zero cosmological constant , we have an initial quantum state which is flat , in leading order , @xmath217 this is quite reminiscent of the ashtekar - lewandowski vacuum , which is a flat functional of the connection .      as done previously , we calculate the expressions for @xmath207 and @xmath208 which allows us to write @xmath209 and @xmath210 as @xmath218 where , from now on , we drop the subscript @xmath142 from @xmath209 for convenience . using and ,",

    "the main reason we are able to do this is because of the fact that the canonical momentum @xmath180 of the scalar field is a constant , meaning that @xmath142 is a monotonous function of @xmath223 . changing variables from @xmath223 to @xmath142 , we have @xmath224 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to the scalar field @xmath142 .",
    "then , using , becomes : @xmath225 this equation can be solved explicitly , yielding @xmath226 ^ 2 -9\\lambda p^2}\\ ] ] where , for shorthand notation we have used @xmath227 and @xmath84 , @xmath228 being the integration constants .",
    "using the constraint equation , the action @xmath39 can then be written in a more compact form as : @xmath229 ^ 2}_{s_{(1 ) } } + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\left(b_i v_i - b_o v_o\\right)}_{s_{(2)}}.\\ ] ] where @xmath230 and @xmath231 refer to the actions for the bulk and the boundary , respectively .",
    "now , the integration constants @xmath232 need to be solved for and the action needs to be re - expressed in terms of the boundary values . for this , we set our initial condition such that the initial volume is the same as the minimum volume @xmath233 in other words , @xmath234 this leads to the condition @xmath235 . therefore , the minimum volume @xmath236 becomes : @xmath237 writing the constraint equation in an appropriate form , we can rewrite @xmath238 as @xmath239 therefore , using the condition @xmath240 , we could solve for @xmath84 in terms of @xmath241 as : @xmath242 however , using and , we see that @xmath243 picks out an initial condition in the form @xmath244 . from , this translates to @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "the task from here on is straightforward : determine the values of all the parameters that appear in the action @xmath39 in terms of the four boundary values ( preferably the ones ) involving the position variables of gravity and the scalar field , namely @xmath247 .",
    "then we can just plug them back into the action to find the explicit expression .    the term @xmath248 is easily evaluated since we know that @xmath235 . a simple calculation",
    "tells us that @xmath249 . in order to evaluate @xmath250 , we make use of the solution @xmath251 of the equations of motion from at the final boundary .",
    "this then results in a quadratic equation whose solution results in two values for @xmath250 , namely @xmath252 on first sight it is rather surprising that two signs should show up when solving for one integration constant . since the two signs refer to two different paths , its only natural to allow for both the paths .",
    "this translates to adding the respective actions of the corresponding trajectories .",
    "therefore , our action @xmath253 .",
    "hence , we carry both signs in our subsequent analysis .",
    "evaluating @xmath231 is straightforward , where we use the constraint equation at the two boundaries to replace @xmath238 and @xmath254 as a function of @xmath255 and @xmath256 , repectively .",
    "this leads to @xmath257 @xmath230 can be simplified after integration , and evaluating the expression from @xmath258 to @xmath259 leads to @xmath260 where @xmath261    thus , plugging in the values of the respective constants and combining the actions @xmath230 and @xmath231 , we end up with @xmath262    having obtained an explicit expression for the action , we can plot @xmath263 against @xmath264 .",
    "we choose @xmath265 and , @xmath266 , the latter approximating a preferred value for @xmath76 from black hole entropy calculations in lqg .",
    "we thus obtain the following :    [ spm24 ]   on the y - axis against @xmath264 on the x - axis with no singular value for @xmath264 .",
    "the right panel shows a plot of @xmath267 against @xmath264 with @xmath264 taking a singular value at @xmath268.,title=\"fig : \" ]   on the y - axis against @xmath264 on the x - axis with no singular value for @xmath264 .",
    "the right panel shows a plot of @xmath267 against @xmath264 with @xmath264 taking a singular value at @xmath268.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ ssum24 ]   looks against @xmath264 .",
    "its clearly seen that the sum of the two actions has resulted in a peak / singularity at @xmath268.,title=\"fig : \" ]    when interpreting the wave function , it is important to remember that we are missing the factor related to the determinant of the hessian of the action ( see ) , which could change the look of the wave function substantially .",
    "an important thing to notice about the expression for the action is that it is a function of just two variables ( @xmath269 ) , since we have used the @xmath240 condition which reduced the parameter space from three to two .",
    "this is particularly satisfying because now we have written the quantum state purely in terms of the parameters which mimic the full theory , that is to say the canonical momentum @xmath180 of the scalar field @xmath142 and @xmath270 , the parametrization of the connection at initial and final boundary , respectively .",
    "the only further boundary condition we have set is @xmath244 .",
    "it replaces the no - boundary condition of hartle and hawking .",
    "in this work , we have studied the question of how the formal ground state for canonical quantum gravity proposed by hartle and hawking could be applied in loop quantum gravity .",
    "the most important result of the work seems to be the fact , that an immediate translation of the construction of hartle and hawking to the variables used in loop quantum gravity is not possible , since the resulting state does not have the same formal properties as the original . in particular ,",
    "the original state is constructed from the _ euclidean _ action , but satisfies the _ lorentzian _ hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this is no longer the case with the analogous construction for ashtekar - barbero variables .    that the hartle - hawking construction is dependent on the variables used in the quantization to this extent is somewhat surprising to us , and we have found no statement to this effect in the literature . that the same seems to hold true for analogous but simpler systems such as the relativistic particle makes us confident in this conclusion , however",
    "the fact that the construction works for adm variables but not for some others can be interpreted as nature taking a preference in them .",
    "one can also take it as a fortuitous accident without further ramifications . in any case",
    ", it is an interesting observation .",
    "with the closely analogous proposal off the table , we have looked for alternatives that do satisfy all the quantum constraints at least in a formal sense . a possibility we found is to use the lorentzian action in place of the euclidean one in the construction of the state .",
    "the resulting state satisfies all the quantum constraints in a formal sense .",
    "however , with integrating over lorentzian spacetimes , one needs to talk about boundary conditions again , since these geometries can not be compact anymore .",
    "thus some of the elegance of the `` no - boundary '' proposal is lost .",
    "we have investigated the new proposal in some detail in the cosmological setting , and found somewhat natural boundary conditions to replace the no - boundary condition of hartle and hawking . in a very formal saddle point approximation",
    ", we found interesting structures : for the case of a vanishing cosmological constant , the state is a constant wave function , quite reminiscent of the ashtekar - lewandowski vacuum , which is a flat functional of the connection . for positive @xmath143",
    ", on the other hand , the state appears to be sharply peaked . in this analysis",
    ", we are certainly missing a factor related to the determinant of the hessian of the action , which could change this picture substantially .",
    "there are several loose ends . on the one hand ,",
    "the calculations in the cosmological settings should be refined , checked , and interpreted .",
    "one important outstanding check is to demonstrate that the result of the saddle point approximation indeed satisfies the quantum constraints in a suitable approximate sense . on the other hand",
    ", one could ponder the failure of the `` obvious '' generalization of the hartle - hawking construction to ashtekar - barbero variables more deeply .",
    "signature change is more complicated in the corresponding hamilton constraint , in particular it is intertwined with the immirzi parameter",
    ". it would thus be interesting to consider other generalizations , possibly involving changes in the immirzi parameter , that satisfy the lorentzian constraint through a more complicated mechanism than our present proposal .",
    "sd and hs thank their colleagues at the institute for quantum gravity , fau erlangen - nrnberg for discussions .",
    "the question of how to apply the hartle - hawking proposal to lqg was first brought up by d.  yeom , and hs thanks him and d.  hwang for many enlightening discussions about the hartle - hawking state .",
    "the canonical formulation of `` polyakov action '' for the free relativistic particle shares some similarities with general relativity in ashtekar - barbero variables .",
    "it is a reparametrization invariant theory , leading to a constrained canonical description .",
    "moreover , as in ashtekar - barbero variables , two metrics ( world line metric , target space metric ) play a role in the theory , and we can express the world line metric by an einbein field .",
    "therefore , we will consider the free relativistic particle as a toy model in this appendix .",
    "we will show that an analogue of the hh state runs into problems even in this very simple setting .",
    "we will perform the same procedure we have followed for the adm and ashtekar variables . for a free relativistic particle , the action is given by @xmath271 , where @xmath272 is the minkowski metric and @xmath273 is the mass of the particle .",
    "in analogy with palatini / tetrad action , consider the following action with @xmath274 as the ( absolute value of the ) einbein field along the world - line of the particle @xcite : @xmath275 it can easily be checked that this action is invariant under reparametrizations . for this action , the conjugate momenta are given by : @xmath276 setting @xmath277 , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the lagrangian .",
    "@xmath280 plays the role of a lagrange multiplier , enforcing the constraint @xmath281 a similar calculation can be carried out for the euclidean theory , which we take to be defined by the wick rotation @xmath282 and @xmath283 , i.e. , @xmath284 the canonical momenta are now @xmath285 which we have not distinguished by notation from their lorentzian counterparts . in principle",
    ", one has to carefully work with the different dependence of the momenta on the velocities for the different signatures in the following calculation , but it turns out that due to the quadratic nature of the action , this subtlety does not have any effect . in the euclidean theory ,",
    "the constraint is @xmath286 when splitting into components , we thus have @xmath287 formal quantization has @xmath288 by suitably choosing the discretization of the path integral at the boundary , or equivalently by adding a suitable boundary term , we obtain @xmath289 for @xmath290= \\int_{d(x)}\\mathcal{d}x'\\:\\mathcal{d}e\\:e^{-s_e[x',e]},\\ ] ] we then find @xmath291&=\\left[-\\frac{e}{2}(\\widehat{p}_0)^2\\,+\\frac{e}{2}(\\widehat{p}_i)^2\\,+\\frac{e\\,m^2}{2}\\right]\\ : \\int_{d(x)}\\mathcal{d}x'\\:\\mathcal{d}e\\:e^{-s_e[x',e]}\\\\ & = \\int_{d(x)}\\mathcal{d}x'\\:\\mathcal{d}e\\:\\left[\\frac{e}{2}(p_0)^2\\,-\\frac{e}{2}(p_i)^2\\,+\\frac{e\\,m^2}{2}\\right]\\:e^{-s_e[x',e]}\\\\ & = \\int_{d(x)}\\mathcal{d}x'\\:\\mathcal{d}e\\:\\left[-h_e\\,+ e\\,(p_0)^2\\right]\\ : e^{-s_e[x',e]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , apart from the vanishing euclidean hamiltonian constraint , we obtain an extra term which , however , does not go to zero under the path integral . comparing the relativistic particle with the lqg case , we notice that these two cases are quite similar , in the sense that in both these cases there appears an extra term which does not vanish under the path integral .",
