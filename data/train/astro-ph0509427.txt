    "it is quite difficult for field star populations to produce low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , especially those with neutron star primaries .",
    "supernova explosions which eject more than half the mass of a system normally leave the systems unbound . therefore the only ways to produce lmxbs through binary stellar evolution are through common envelope evolution which ejects much of the mass of the black hole s or neutron star s progenitor before the supernova occurs ( paczynski 1976 ; kalogera & webbink 1998 ) , or through a finely - tuned asymmetric velocity kick which occurs at the birth of the neutron star or black hole ( brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ; kalogera 1998 ) . because of these uncertainties , and other such as the correlation between the initial masses of the stars in a binary system , theoretical rates of x - ray binary formation are highly uncertain .",
    "theoretical models suggest that the maximum rate of x - ray binary production should occur only a few gyrs after a burst of star formation ( e.g. white & ghosh 1998 )",
    ". any persistently bright lmxb would consume the entire mass of the donor star in a few hundred million years [ i.e. the lifetime for radiatively efficient accretion is @xmath2 yrs for a 1 @xmath3 donor star ] , so the presence of bright x - ray binaries in old stellar populations presents a challenge to theory . with these motivations in mind",
    ", it has been suggested that a large fraction of x - ray binaries in the field populations of galaxies might have been produced in globular clusters , which are known to have about 100 times as many bright lmxbs per unit stellar mass as the field populations of the galaxy ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) .",
    "this overabundance is likely due to dynamical interactions which can form new x - ray binaries late in the lifetime of a stellar population ( e.g. fabian , pringle & rees 1975 ; hills 1976 ) .",
    "these dynamically formed systems would then be released into the field either through dynamical ejections or tidal disruption of the globular clusters in which they were born ( e.g. grindlay 1988 ; white , sarazin & kulkarni 2002 ) .",
    "alternative possibilities are that these systems are primarily transient accretors with very low duty cycles , so that they can have long lifetimes as occasionally bright accretors ( piro & bildsten 2002 ) , that many are ultracompact x - ray binaries ( i.e. neutron stars or black holes accreting from white dwarfs ) , which tend to form with a much longer delay from a burst of star formation ( bildsten & deloye 2004 ) , and that some lmxbs have evolved from intermediate mass x - ray binaries , where the mass donor is initially @xmath4 ( e.g. podsiadlowski et al .",
    ".    the ideal sample of stars for testing the relative importance of these different mechanisms for forming x - ray binaries would be one with no globular clusters and a star formation history which is dominated by a short epoch of star formation at least 8 gyrs ago .",
    "the system would also need to be nearby enough that one could observe its quiescent x - ray binaries in a reasonable exposure time .",
    "the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is located at a distance of 79@xmath54 kpc , and has only old stellar populations , making it the only local group galaxy meeting these criteria ( mateo 1998 and references within ) .",
    "recent studies have refined the age and metallicity determinations for this galaxy , finding that its colour - magnitude diagram is well matched by a stellar population which formed over a 1 - 2 gyr period beginning about 14 gyrs ago ( e.g. monkiewicz et al .",
    "1999 ) , and with an average metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.4 with a dispersion of 0.2 dex ( e.g. babusiaux , gilmore & irwin 2005 and references within ) , although a small tail of residual star formation continuing until about 2 gyrs ago can not be ruled out with existing data ( monkiewicz et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we report the discovery of five faint x - ray binaries in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "the presence of so many x - ray binaries in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy which is devoid of globular clusters indicates that binary evolution can produce a substantial number of lmxbs without invoking stellar interactions .",
    "we have obtained 21 exposures of 6-kiloseconds each with the chandra x - ray observatory over the time period from 26 april 2004 to 10 january 2005 .",
    "the monitoring , rather than a single deep observation , was performed in order to search for bright transient sources , but none were found .",
    "we then stacked the data to make a single image of the data on acis - s3 , and ran wavdetect , finding 74 sources in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev band .",
    "based on previous deep field measurements ( e.g. hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) , we estimate that about 50 of these sources should be background agn and that it is unlikely that more than one is a foreground star . given cosmic variance , the actual number of background sources could deviate substantially from this value . in order to determine whether there are supersoft x - ray sources , we have also extracted an image from 0.1 - 0.4 kev , but this image contained no bright sources ( i.e. with more than 10 photons ) that were not found in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev image .",
    "we also ran wavdetect on two other images , made with only photons from 0.5 - 2.0 and 2.0 - 8.0 kev , in order to get a crude estimate of the spectral hardnesses of the detected sources .",
    "none of the bright sources appear to be strongly variable ( i.e. by more than a factor of 2 ) , while there are too few photons in the faintest sources to search for variability . a more detailed discussion of variability of the bright sources will be included in a follow - up paper .",
    "we have compared the positions of the 9 sources with at least 100 detected counts ( giving accurate positions , and making them bright enough to rule out the possibility of a white dwarf accretor ) with the positions of bright optical stars ( @xmath6 ) in the sculptor galaxy from schweitzer et al .",
    "the stars in the schweitzer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) catalog are all red giants , asymptotic giant branch stars , or horizontal branch stars .",
    "we have also checked whether the single brightest source has an optical counterpart in the deep optical photometry of hurley - keller , mateo & grebel ( 1999 ) .    below 100 counts",
    ", there also appears to be an excess compared to blank fields , but the numbers begin to be dominated by background agn .",
    "the fainter sources which are in the sculptor galaxy could be either x - ray binaries or bright accreting white dwarfs in the sculptor galaxy . while we do search for optical counterparts to these objects",
    ", we will concentrate on the x - ray brighter sources in this letter , and will make a more detailed follow - up of the x - ray faint sources in future work .",
    "four of the sources match the optical positions in schweitzer et al . within 1 arcsecond ( see table 1 ) . if we allow for a single boresight correction of 0.6  between the chandra positions and the positions of schweitzer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , then all the matches are within 0.4  .",
    "this boresight correction is of a typical size for chandra ( see http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/aspect/celmon/ ) . while the 0.4  dispersion is substantially larger than the formal uncertainties in source positions for either the x - ray or optical catalogs , it is well within the systematic uncertainties in source positions found by other groups over large fields of view ( see e.g. kundu , maccarone & zepf 2002 ; barger et al .",
    "the optical catalog of schweitzer et al . contains 529 stars within the acis - s3 region . because these are stacked monitoring observations over a variety of roll angles , the region is a circle of radius @xmath7 rather than a square of side 8. the probability of a single match being a random superposition within 1  ( to take",
    "a conservative estimate of what might be called a match ) is thus 0.0045 , leading to an expected number of chance superpositions given 9 attempts at matching of 0.04 .",
    "alternatively , one may consider that the next closest match after these four has a separation of more than 2  .",
    "it is thus unlikely that any of these matches are chance superpositions and highly unlikely that more than one is .",
    "all the optical counterparts have colors and magnitudes consistent with either the giant branch or the horizontal branch of sculptor , and all have proper motion estimates that indicate probabilities of at least 96% of being galaxy members .",
    "the fifth match is the brightest x - ray source in our sample , which is found at ra=1h00m13.9s , dec=-33d44m42.5s .",
    "while there is no strong evidence for it to be variable in our monitoring campaign , it was not detected in the rosat bright source all - sky survey , so it must either be variable at the level of a factor of a few , or it must have a very hard spectrum at soft x - rays .",
    "its optical counterpart is @xmath8 ( d. hurley - keller private communication - see hurley - keller et al .",
    "1999 for a description of how the photometry was done ) , giving it a luminosity and color roughly consistent with a solar - type star in the low metallicity environment of the sculptor galaxy , and it appears to be near the turnoff of the main sequence in the sculptor galaxy . as we do not have the full source catalogs of hurley - keller et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , it is not clear what is the false match probability for this source .",
    "however , if it is not a real match , then the real match is fainter than @xmath9 , which would give a ratio of x - ray to optical luminosity of more than 100 , putting it in a region of parameter space which is populated almost exclusively by x - ray binaries ( see e.g. maccacaro et al .",
    "all the secure x - ray binaries are shown on the stacked image in figure 1 .    to estimate the ratio between counts / sec and ergs / sec/@xmath10 , we use the first epoch observation of the brightest source (",
    "i.e. the one whose optical counterpart lies close to the main sequence ) .",
    "we extract its x - ray spectrum using psextract , and fits its spectrum in xspec 11.0 , and find that its count rate of 0.01 cts / sec corresponds to a luminosity from 0.5 - 8.0 kev of @xmath0=5@xmath11 ergs / sec .",
    "the spectral model which fit to this source was a power law with @xmath12 and column density frozen to the galactic value of @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "we use the derived scaling between count rate and luminosity scaling to estimate the x - ray luminosities of the other sources shown in table 1 , although we note that most of the sources are a bit harder than this source , so their actual luminosities are likely to be a bit higher than those in the table .",
    "we note that the spectra of these sources are substantially harder than what would be expected from blackbody models with @xmath15 kev .",
    "this is not suprising , since either a black hole or a neutron star accretor in this luminosity range is likely to be dominated by a power law component ( jonker et al .",
    "2004 ; kong et al .",
    "the soft , thermal x - ray spectrum is typically only seen for neutron star accretors below about 5@xmath16 ergs / sec , where the luminosity can be produced by the crustal emission from the neutron star ( e.g. brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ) .    we have searched the remainder of the x - ray catalog for matches as well , and have found four more matches , although this time with a larger matching radius of 1.5  ( since the sources have fewer counts and hence have less well - defined x - ray positions ) .",
    "one is identified as a background galaxy , while the other three have optical colors and proper motions which indicate that they are stars in the sculptor galaxy .",
    "two of these objects are faint enough that they could conceivably represent the bright end of the accreting white dwarf ( i.e. cv / symbiotic star ) luminosity function , rather than quiescent x - ray binaries . however , since these objects would be in the far tail of the white dwarf luminosity function , but in the middle of the luminosity distribution for quiescent lmxbs , we believe they are more likely to have neutron star or black hole accretors than white dwarf accretors .",
    "one of these objects is almost as bright as the sources in table 1 , but did not make the 100 counts cut because it is located on the periphery of the field of view in a region that was covered for less than half the observations .",
    "even searching for counterparts to all 74 x - ray sources , the expected number of false sources is still only about 0.4 , so likely all the matches ( or all but one ) are real .",
    "further optical follow - up will help determine the nature of these sources .",
    "the properties of these sources are listed in table 2 , with the luminosities computed using the same photon count rate to energy flux ratio as for the sources listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\">,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "first , let us convince ourselves that these sources , are in fact , x - ray binaries . given that the optical counterparts fit well on the red giant branch and horizontal branch of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy , and that they have proper motions which strongly imply that they are galaxy members , they are extremely unlikely to be background agn .",
    "the four systems listed in table 1 all have x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath17 ergs / sec in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev range .",
    "nearly all cataclysmic variables ( see e.g. verbunt et al . 1997 ; heinke et al .",
    "2005 ) and symbiotic stars ( e.g. anderson et al .",
    "1981 ; galloway  sokoloski 2004 ) have x - ray luminosities below this level in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev band .",
    "non - magnetic cvs emit hard x - rays only when they have optically thin boundary layers on the white dwarf surface , and at high accretion rates , these boundary layers become optically thick ( e.g. pandel et al .",
    "2005 and references within ) .",
    "thus the highest hard x - ray luminosities are typically found in magnetic cvs , where much of the accretion is channelled down the magnetic poles and hence radiates free - free emission ( see king 1983 and references within ) .",
    "suleimanov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) quote luminosities above @xmath18 ergs / sec for v1223 sgr and gk per , but they have made large absorption corrections and used a larger bandpass than we have . in order to make a consistent comparison , we needed to revise the estimates of suleimanov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and find that if in sculptor , we would have estimated luminosities of @xmath1 ergs / sec .",
    "their findings do indicate that perhaps the faintest source in table 1 is drawn from the very bright end of the magnetic cv distribution , but our other matches are comfortably above this level .",
    "we note also that some symbiotic stars reach soft x - ray luminosities well in excess of @xmath17 ergs / sec , but these sources have very soft spectra peaked in the far ultraviolet , and would ( 1 ) produce very few , if any , counts in the 0.5 - 8 kev range , and ( 2 ) would be very strong emitters in the 0.1 - 0.4 kev range . since we have searched for bright sources in this lower energy range and have failed to find any that were not also quite bright from 0.5 - 8.0 kev , we can rule out the existence of such sources .",
    "our new detections have x - ray luminosities a bit higher than those of most quiescent lmxbs , although since these systems are likely to be wide binaries on the basis of their evolved optical counterparts , this is perhaps not a surprise given the correlation between quiescent luminosities of x - ray binaries and their orbital periods ( see e.g. garcia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the field populations of elliptical galaxies are low duty cycle transients , with red giant donors ( piro & bildsten 2002 ) .",
    "obviously the finding that several of these systems have red giant donors provides support for this hypothesis .",
    "the number of bright ( i.e. @xmath19 ergs / sec ) lmxbs per unit stellar mass seems to be roughly constant across a sample of giant elliptical galaxies ( gilfanov 2004 ) , with a typical value of about one per @xmath20 of stars .",
    "we would then expect about @xmath21 .02 such systems in sculptor , given its mass of about 2@xmath22 ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "given that the duty cycles of these transients are likely to be less than about 1/200 in the scenario of piro & bildsten ( 2002 ) , one would expect that the number of quiescent transient x - ray binaries in the sculptor galaxy would be at least a few , and possibly much higher if the duty cycles were even smaller than 1/200 .",
    "our discovery of one clear case of an x - ray binary with a red giant counterpart and a few more candidates is thus in reasonable agreement with the picture suggested by piro & bildsten ( 2002 ) .",
    "several matches appear to be associated with horizontal branch , rather than giant branch stars ( i.e. those with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . given that the photometric errors at limit of the photometry used are about 0.1 magnitudes ( schweitzer et al .",
    "1995 ) , some of these could be giant stars shifted onto the horizontal branches by measurement uncertainties , but washington photometry ( westfall et al . 2005 ) and infrared photometry ( babusiaux et al . 2005 ) also find that source 609 from schweizter et al ( 1995 ) seems to be a horizontal branch star .",
    "it therefore seems that horizontal branch stars also may be the donor stars in x - ray binaries .",
    "this might be indicating that mass loss from the accretion process has affected the structures of these stars substantially , yielding a donor star similar to that in cygnus x-2 , which appears in a colour - magnitude diagram at a location near the horizontal branch , despite probably having had a very different evolutionary history ( see e.g. podsialowski & rappaport 2000 ; kolb et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that if the accretors are black holes , optical light from the accretion flow could contaminate the stellar light , as it does in v404 cygni ( zurita et al .",
    "2004 ) ; our newly detected systems are about 10 times as bright in x - rays and about 3 times as bright in the optical as v404 cygni",
    ". optical contamination by the accretion flow s light should have a smaller impact if the accretors are neutron stars , since the optical accretion emission from neutron stars is substantially fainter than for black holes at the same x - ray luminosity ( see e.g. jain 2001 ) .",
    "it is likely that there are actually many more quiescent x - ray binaries in the sculptor galaxy than the five strong matches we have presented here and the three additional tenative matches .",
    "our detection limits in this data set are at a luminosity of a little bit above @xmath25 ergs / sec , while quiescent lmxbs have been seen to be as faint as @xmath26 ergs / sec , with most of the faintest sources having black hole accretors ( garcia et al .",
    "therefore , some quiescent x - ray binaries could be below our sensitivity limits , although most neutron star accretors are brighter than these limits in quiescence , and there do seem to be higher quiescent luminosities for long period transients , even for black hole accretors .",
    "there may also be other quiescent x - ray binaries which are detected in our observations , but which have faint optical counterparts .",
    "these could be , for example , ultracompact x - ray binaries , which have also been suggested to be systems which should be present in old stellar populations ( bildsten & deloye 2004 ) , or even x - ray binaries with lower main sequence donors which simply took longer than the typical few gyrs ( white & ghosh 1998 ) to come into contact .",
    "we plan to investigate these possibilities in future work with deeper optical photometry and with spectroscopic follow - ups .      scaling from globular clusters",
    ", it is suprising to see so many x - ray binaries in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "globular clusters are generally thought to be enhanced in x - ray binary production by a factor of about 100 compared to field stars ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) .",
    "searches for quiescent x - ray binaries in the milky way s globular clusters have focused not on a representative sample of clusters , but on the clusters where the highest rates of dynamical interactions are expected",
    ". nonetheless , as an upper limit to the enhancement rate of the production of quiescent x - ray binaries in globular clusters , we can compare ngc  6440 , the cluster with the highest stellar collision rate , with sculptor .",
    "ngc  6440 has a mass of about 1/9 that of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( harris 1996 ; mateo 1998 ) . using a fainter @xmath0 limit than we have used in this paper , heinke et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found 8 quiescent lmxbs in ngc  6440 , so the number density of x - ray binaries per unit stellar mass in ngc  6440 is enhanced by , at most , a factor of 10 relative to that in sculptor .",
    "this is likely related to the evolved donor stars for the x - ray binaries in sculptor , and hence their long orbital periods .",
    "such long period binaries are susceptible both to ionization in the densest parts of a globular cluster where their binding energies may be less than the kinetic energies of individual stars ( heggie 1975 ) , and to having eccentricities induced by weak fly - by interactions , which will then speed up their evolution ( hut & paczynski 1984 ; rasio & heggie 1995 ; heggie & rasio 1996 ) .",
    "since globular clusters contain about 100 times as many bright x - ray binaries per unit stellar mass than field populations , but no more than 10 times as many total x - ray binaries per unit stellar mass , it appears that the increased duty cycles of gc lmxbs is more important than their increased number density for explaining why there are so many more bright gc lmxbs per unit stellar mass than field lmxbs .",
    "finally , we consider the implications of these results for the milky way s bulge s x - ray binary population .",
    "the bulge of the milky way contains about @xmath27 times as many stars as the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy , meaning that it should have about 2,500 x - ray binaries if the number of binaries scales linearly with mass .",
    "in fact , since x - ray binary production is enhanced in metal rich systems ( at least for globular clusters - see kundu , maccarone & zepf 2003 for evidence of this effect and maccarone , kundu & zepf 2004 for a discussion of a binary evolution model for this effect which should work equally well in field populations as in globular clusters ) the milky way might contain a few times more than this number of x - ray binaries .",
    "our estimate is comparable to numbers from theoretical predictions ( iben et al .",
    "1997 ; belczynski & taam 2004 ) .",
    "finally , we note that with only about 500 optical stars in the schweitzer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) catalog , at least @xmath281% of the giant branch / horizontal branch stars in sculptor are in systems with accreting neutron stars or black holes .",
    "based on this finding , one would expect that a large number of similar systems are likely to be found in surveys that include hundreds of red giant stars",
    ". this hypothesis should be testable as the results from the champlane survey ( grindlay et al .",
    "2003 ) begin to come in , or in a large area survey of the galactic bulge .",
    "we find at least 5 x - ray binaries with likely neutron star or black hole accretors in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "four of these have evolved optical counterparts , providing support for the hypothesis of piro & bildsten ( 2002 ) that a large fraction of the non - globular cluster x - ray sources in elliptical galaxies are wide binary systems with red giant donors which have low duty cycles .",
