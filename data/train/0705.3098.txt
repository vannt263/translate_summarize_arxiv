    "chaotic motions were already found and described in a number of various spacetimes , in particular in the black hole systems , see e.g. @xcite , or in special axisymmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "some time ago we discovered chaotic behaviour of geodesics in specific vacuum _",
    "pp_-waves @xcite .",
    "although chaotic interaction of test particles with linearized gravitational waves propagating on flat minkowski background had been studied before @xcite , this was the first explicit demonstration of chaos in _ exact _ radiative spacetimes .",
    "a natural question thus emerged whether a similar complicated behaviour of geodesics could be found in other exact solutions of einstein s equations that represent gravitational waves .",
    "there exist several important classes of such solutions which are geometrically different from _",
    "pp_-waves , for example the family of kundt spacetimes with non - expanding wavefronts or radiative spacetimes of the robinson  trautman type @xcite which describe expanding waves .    in the present work we concentrate on specific vacuum type  n spacetimes from the class of solutions that admit a non - expanding , shear - free , and twist - free null geodesic congruence which was first described in 1961 by wolfgang kundt @xcite ( for recent reviews see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these so - called kundt waves may be interesting from the theoretical point of view because all curvature invariants of all orders identically vanish for such spacetimes @xcite .",
    "they may thus play an important role in string theory and quantum gravity since there are no quantum corrections to all perturbative orders @xcite .",
    "some aspects of geodesic motions in these spacetimes have already been studied and described . for example , it was shown in @xcite that geodesic deviations exhibit a transverse structure of relative motions of test particles . in @xcite",
    "we presented explicit families of timelike , null and spacelike geodesics and parallelly propagated frames which enabled us to elucidate some global properties of the spacetimes , such as an inherent rotation of the wave - propagation direction , or the character of singularities .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that the characteristic envelope singularity of the rotated wave - fronts @xcite is a ( non - scalar ) curvature singularity , although all scalar invariants of the riemann tensor vanish there .",
    "nevertheless , an open question has remained whether geodesic motion itself exhibits chaotic behaviour , analogous to the chaos in _",
    "pp_-waves @xcite . in the present work",
    "we demonstrate that this is indeed the case . after a brief review of the kundt vacuum waves in section  [ sec2 ] , we show in section  [ sec3 ] by a numerical fractal method that geodesics in these spacetimes are chaotic .",
    "the metric of the kundt gravitational waves @xcite ( distinct from the widely known class of _ pp_-waves ) can be written in the form @xcite @xmath0 where the function @xmath1 depends on retarded time @xmath2 and on spatial coordinates @xmath3 which span the plane wave - fronts @xmath4 . due to the presence of a ( non - scalar ) curvature `` envelope '' singularity at @xmath5 , we have to restrict ourselves to the region in which @xmath6 .",
    "the geodesic equations corresponding to ( [ metric ] ) are @xmath7\\dot{u}^2\\ , \\label{gv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , there is the normalization condition of four - velocity : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes respectively the timelike , null or spacelike character of the geodesic .",
    "specific geodesic motion given by equations ( [ gx])([normalization ] ) crucially depends on the particular form of the spacetime function @xmath1 .",
    "we concentrate here on type  n vacuum kundt spacetimes  ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "it such a case the function @xmath11 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath12 , see @xcite .",
    "a general solution to this field equation is thus @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary function holomorphic in the argument @xmath15 .",
    "if the function @xmath14 is linear in @xmath16 or independent of it , this generates only a flat space .",
    "the simplest radiative kundt spacetimes thus arise when @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . as in @xcite",
    "we will consider only the waves of a constant profile , i.e. @xmath20 independent of @xmath2 , so that @xmath21 we can then use the translational symmetry in @xmath22 to remove the constant @xmath23 .",
    "we will thus investigate geodesics in `` polynomial '' kundt spacetimes characterized by the structural function @xmath24 where @xmath25 are constants , and @xmath26 . introducing polar coordinates ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , we may write @xmath29 which is an @xmath30-saddle function .    the metric ( [ metric ] ) , ( [ gobecna ] ) admits the killing vector @xmath31 whose norm is given by @xmath32 .",
    "these kundt spacetimes can thus be invariantly divided into regions in which this killing vector is timelike or spacelike , separated by the boundaries on which the vector @xmath31 in null .",
    "this appears when @xmath33 is smaller tan , greater than , or equal to @xmath34 , respectively . for a fixed value of  @xmath35",
    "this is visualized in figure  [ f : kill - re ] for @xmath36 : the upper pictures correspond to @xmath37 while the lower ones correspond to @xmath38 .",
    "the killing vector is timelike in the gray regions while it is spacelike in the white regions of the @xmath39-plane .",
    "the system of non - linear differential equations ( [ gx])([gv ] ) with ( [ gobecna ] ) is quite complicated , so one can explicitly find only a few very special analytic solutions , see @xcite . in order to obtain the global picture of a geodesic motion in the studied spacetimes , it is necessary to perform numerical investigations .      in these numerical integrations",
    "we make the following choice of initial conditions . in the kundt",
    "coordinates @xmath40 , the initial _ position _ of each geodesic @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 while the initial _ velocity _ is @xmath44 for given @xmath45 and @xmath46 , it is thus a one - parameter family of geodesics parametrized by @xmath47 .    the geometric meaning and justification of such `` somewhat peculiar '' choice of the initial conditions",
    "is provided by the transformation from the kundt coordinates @xmath40 to the standard minkowski coordinates @xmath48 for the flat space case when @xmath49 , namely @xmath50\\ , \\qquad t = x[v+u(1+uv)]\\ , \\label{transfmink}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see @xcite .",
    "we immediately obtain @xmath51 all these test particles thus _ start from rest _",
    "( at the same time @xmath52 and plane @xmath53 ) from the position @xmath54 , i.e. on a _ circle _ of radius @xmath46 , centred around @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 in ( [ inipos2 ] ) is the standard polar angle along this circle . in view of the geometric interpretation of the kundt spacetimes presented in @xcite",
    ", the initial positions of the geodesic test particles are localized on @xmath57 , which is a half - plane tangent to an expanding cylinder @xmath58 , @xmath59 arbitrary , as illustrated in figure  [ f : poly - ini ] .    the last term in expression ( [ inivel ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath20 , has been included in order to guarantee the consistency of the geodesic equations and the normalization condition ( [ normalization ] ) across the wave - surface @xmath57 even in a non - flat case . in other words , we assume the continuity of the geodesics in the kundt coordinates @xmath40 on @xmath57 , and also the continuity of the corresponding coordinate velocities , except for an inevitable jump in @xmath60 equal to @xmath61 .",
    "the  physical interpretation of these assumptions is that , in fact , we investigate geodesic motion of free test particles which are initially at rest in a ( locally ) minkowski space in front of a _",
    "shock wave_. these particles are hit simultaneously by the initial wave - front @xmath57 , and subsequently they start to move under the influence of the kundt gravitational wave described by ( [ metric ] ) , ( [ gobecna ] ) .",
    "let us now present the numerically obtained results which demonstrate a typical behaviour of geodesics in the above `` polynomial '' kundt spacetimes .    in figure",
    "[ f : r8 - 0 ] , we show a family of geodesics in the spacetimes ( [ metric ] ) , ( [ gobecna ] ) with @xmath37 , @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 , for initial data ( [ inipos])([inivel ] ) , ignoring here the value of the coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath35 .",
    "we have chosen the characteristic radius @xmath64 and considered the cases when @xmath65 which are shown in parts ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) .",
    "we observe that the geodesics either ( in a finite proper time ) terminate in the envelope singularity @xmath5 , or are unbounded and _ radially escape to infinity _ in the @xmath39-plane .",
    "interestingly , they escape _ through only one of the outcome channels _ which exactly correspond to the axes of the regions in which the killing vector @xmath31 is spacelike , cf the white regions in figures  [ f : kill - re ] and  [ f : poly - ini ] . as in the case of non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-waves @xcite , as the test particles escape , their frequency of oscillations around the axis of the outcome channel grows to infinity while the amplitude of oscillations tends to zero . for small values of the parameter @xmath66 , the `` attractive effect '' of the envelope singularity is dominant",
    "so that almost all particles approach @xmath5 while , with a growing value of @xmath66 , the effect of the gravitational wave becomes stronger and thus more and more geodesic particles are forced to escape to infinity through the outcome channels .",
    "in fact , they are attracted to the curvature singularity at @xmath67 , see expression ( [ gobecna ] ) which has the form @xmath29 .",
    "this characteristic behaviour also occurs in the case @xmath68 corresponding to @xmath38 , @xmath62 , with the radius of the initial circle @xmath69 , illustrated for @xmath70 in parts ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) of figure  [ f : r8 - 1 ] , respectively . again , for small values of the parameter @xmath66 all the geodesics end in the envelope singularity @xmath5 , but with a growing @xmath66 the effect of the polynomial kundt gravitational wave increases and the outcome channels open .",
    "these coincide with the regions in which the killing vector @xmath31 is spacelike , see figures  [ f : kill - re ] ,  [ f : poly - ini ] .",
    "although the geodesics which move through the channels with decreasing @xmath71 still terminate at @xmath5 ( in fact , such channels are somewhat `` bent '' by the presence of the envelope singularity ) , those with a growing @xmath71 escape to infinity , @xmath72 .",
    "the main objective of the present paper , however , is to establish the chaotic behaviour of geodesics in the kundt - wave spacetimes .",
    "chaos is usually indicated by a highly sensitive dependence of possible outcomes on the choice of initial conditions . the standard invariant approach to prove chaotic motion , called a fractal method , was advanced in general relativity , e.g. , in the papers @xcite .",
    "it starts with a definition of several different outcomes , that is `` types of ends '' of all possible trajectories .",
    "subsequently , a large set of initial conditions is evolved numerically until one of the outcome states is always reached .",
    "chaos is established if the basin boundaries which separate initial conditions leading to different outcomes are fractal .",
    "we shall now demonstrate that exactly these structures can be observed in the system studied .",
    "a natural parametrization of the unit circle of _ initial positions _ ( [ inipos ] ) , ( [ inipos2 ] ) for the geodesics ( some of which are visualised in figure  [ f : r8 - 1 ] ) is provided by the polar coordinate @xmath47 .",
    "obviously , for large values of @xmath66 there are ( at most )  @xmath30 outcome channels throughout which the unbounded geodesics may approach the curvature singularity at infinite values of @xmath73 , where @xmath30 is the power of the metric function ( [ gobecna ] ) .",
    "these _ distinct channels _ represent possible outcomes of our system , and we assign them the symbol @xmath74 . in the illustrative case @xmath62 , it takes one of the corresponding discrete values , @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , @xmath76 denotes those geodesics which approach infinity through the channel centered around the axis @xmath77 , @xmath78 corresponds to `` upper right '' channel , @xmath79 corresponds to `` upper left '' channel , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are their `` lower '' counterparts , see part ( a ) of figure  [ f : rc81l1 ] .",
    "+    in addition to these five labeled outcome channels , there are three undistinguishable channels oriented towards the left .",
    "these are influenced by the envelope singularity localized at @xmath5 so strongly that we must ignore them as outcome channels : we assign them a common superfluous label `` @xmath82 '' . to be precise , a  geodesic is assigned the outcome value @xmath83 , once the value of its coordinate @xmath71 drops below 0.5  this ( somewhat artificial but given ) boundary is denoted by a vertical dashed line in part ( a ) of figure  [ f : rc81l1 ] .",
    "the dashed circle of radius 1.5 indicates the value of @xmath73 at which the labels @xmath84 are assigned to the remaining geodesics , i.e. where the outcome channels are discriminated .",
    "note that the function @xmath85 is the analogue of the scattering function which is usually introduced in the classical chaotic scattering problems @xcite with unbounded trajectories .",
    "we observe from the right part ( b ) of figure  [ f : rc81l1 ] that in certain regions the behaviour of the function @xmath85 _ depends very sensitively on _ @xmath47 . as a typical example we present",
    "@xmath86 calculated numerically for 800 geodesics labeled by @xmath87 whose positions on the initial circle @xmath69 ( shifted by @xmath38 in the spacetime with @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) were parametrized by @xmath90 such that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "we display some of the corresponding trajectories in the left part ( a ) of figure  [ f : rc81l1 ] .",
    "in fact , the basin boundaries between the outcomes  indicated by the discontinuities in the function @xmath85  appear to be _",
    "is confirmed on the enlarged detail of the part  ( b ) of figure  [ f : rc81l1 ] , and on the enlarged detail of this detail in figures  [ f : rc81l2 ] , [ f : rc81l3a ] and  [ f : rc81l3b ] , respectively .",
    "+     +     +    in figure  [ f : rc81l2 ] we show such zooming in the interval @xmath93 where we plot 800 geodesics initially located at @xmath94 . in figure",
    "[ f : rc81l3a ] there is a deeper magnification covering the smaller interval @xmath95 by 800 geodesics starting on @xmath96 , and similarly in figure  [ f : rc81l3b ] we present results for another 800 geodesics which start in the interval @xmath97 with initial positions @xmath98 . from these typical pictures",
    "we conclude that the basin boundaries separating the initial data leading to different discrete output channels @xmath74 are highly complicated and , in fact , appears to have a fractal structure .",
    "the dependence of the outcome on the initial condition is extremely sensitive .",
    "it thus seems to be a plausible conjecture that the geodesic motion in the kundt gravitational wave spacetimes studied is genuinely chaotic , as in the previously investigated case of other spacetimes @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "however , to rigorously prove this statement would require a demonstration that the basin boundaries are fractal to an _ arbitrary high level _ ,",
    "i.e. for differences in the initial data which approach zero .",
    "of course , this can not be achieved solely by numerical integration of geodesics due to the inevitable numerical errors . in the case of chaotic motion in non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-waves [ 18 - 21 ] the numerical investigations were complemented and supported by analytic methods : in the transverse section spanned by the @xmath99 spatial coordinates the evolution equations are equivalent to a hamiltonian system with hnon  heiles - type or more general @xmath30-saddle polynomial potentials which are `` textbook '' examples of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the present case of motion in the kundt spacetimes , no such analytic works are available .",
    "the reason is that the system of equations ( 2)(5 ) is much more complex . in particular , the motion in the transverse @xmath99 section is _ not _ decoupled from the @xmath2 and @xmath35 coordinates .",
    "we can thus present only the following heuristic argument for the presence of a genuine chaos . from our numerical simulations we observe that in the @xmath99 section the geodesics are asymptotically restricted to the regions in which the killing vector @xmath31 is spacelike , see figure  [ f : kill - re ] .",
    "moreover , the geodesics `` bounce '' on the corresponding boundaries , as indicated on figure  [ f : details ] which shows the details of figures  [ f : rc81l1 ] ,  [ f : rc81l2 ] ,  [ f : rc81l3a ] and  [ f : rc81l3b ] .",
    "let us note that the boundaries also depend on the value of the coordinate @xmath35 and they therefore evolve with time . in the central region",
    "these geometric boundaries effectively form walls with ( time dependent ) concave shapes , and it is also natural to expect that the geodesic particles may bounce arbitrarily many times between them before they are scattered to one of the outcome channels labeled by @xmath74 .",
    "the curved wall segments have a `` dispersing effect '' on the incident trajectories , and this leads to a rapid separation of nearby geodesics after a few bounces .",
    "we thus expect that the basin boundaries separating the outcomes are fractal to _ any level _ ( the level corresponding basically to the number of bounces performed between the walls in the central region ) , as in the familiar chaotic billiard systems @xcite .",
    "some time ago , the first explicit demonstration of chaos in exact radiative spacetimes was given for a family of non - homogeneous _",
    "pp_-wave solutions which represent the simplest models of exact gravitational waves in general relativity @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have extended these results . using the invariant fractal method we have numerically demonstrated a complicated chaotic character of geodesic motion in the class of kundt spacetimes ( [ metric ] ) with polynomial metric function ( [ gobecna ] ) .",
    "these vacuum spacetimes are of type  n , and therefore they also represent exact gravitational waves .",
    "our work shows that geodesic motion in spacetimes even as simple as _ pp_-waves and the kundt waves can be complex for specific but natural choices of the corresponding metric functions .",
    "this may possibly stimulate future investigation of chaotic behaviour of geodesics in other exact radiative spacetimes , such as non - expanding kundt waves with a cosmological constant .",
