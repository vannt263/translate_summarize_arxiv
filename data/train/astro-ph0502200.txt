    "the hot bubbles caused by the interaction with the activity of the central galaxies have been found in many clusters@xcite .",
    "the heat conductivities across the cold fronts and the surface of the hot bubbles have to be reduced in many order of magnitudes to maintain the structures@xcite .",
    "the large scale fluctuation of the temperature distributions have been found in several clusters(watanabe et al , 1999 ; shibata et al .",
    "2001 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2003 ) . to maintain the observed temperature fluctuations at least for a dynamical time scale of clusters , the order of magnitude reduction of the heat conductivities are required@xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned facts show that a direct method for measuring the heat conductivities may provide crucial informations to study the evolution of the icm .",
    "the recent theoretical progresses have been unveiling that a microscopic instability of the plasma which has a temperature gradient@xcite , could play important roles on the suppression of the heat conductivities@xcite and the origin of cluster magnetic fields(okabe & hattori 2003 ; okabe & hattori 2004 ) .",
    "the heat conduction is the electron thermal energy flow from hot to cold regions .",
    "since it is the third order moment of the electron momentum distribution function , the electron momentum distribution function must have deviation from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution which is the even function of the momentum .",
    "therefore , the electron momentum distribution function of the plasma with a temperature gradient is described by the sum of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , @xmath0 @xmath1 , and the non maxwellian part , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a momentum of electron , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are electron number density , temperature and mass , respectively .",
    "the heat current density , @xmath7 , is described by the @xmath2 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the heat conductivity in the spitzer value unit and @xmath10 is the spitzer heat conductivity .",
    "the spitzer heat conductivity is given by @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron coulomb mean free path@xcite .",
    "the deviation of the electron momentum distribution from the thermal equilibrium distribution@xcite in the plasma with a temperature gradient is described by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electron thermal momentum .",
    "the plasma instability is derived by this local deviation of the electron momentum distribution from the thermal equilibrium distribution .",
    "it has been shown that the instability may provide an origin of the magnetic fields in cluster of galaxies@xcite .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the functional form of the non - equilibrium momentum distribution function is crucial for confirming the above mentioned theoretical models on the suppression of the heat conductivities and generation of the magnetic fields .    in this paper , a spectrum distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( hereafter cmb ) due to the inverse compton scattering with electrons which support heat conduction ,",
    "is examined by solving the boltzmann equation for compton scattering to third - order in the electron momentum .",
    "the result provides a direct method for measuring the heat conductivities and the functional form of the electron momentum distribution functions in the plasma with a temperature gradient .",
    "the spectrum distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to the compton scattering from electrons with momentum distribution function of @xmath16 is given by the boltzmann equation@xcite as @xmath17 - g({\\bf x},{\\bf q})f({\\bf x},{\\bf p})[1+f({\\bf x},{\\bf p'})]\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the photon occupation number with a three - momentum @xmath19 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the three - momentum for photons of four - momentum @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath3 and @xmath23 are the three - momentum for electrons of four - momentum @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the energy of the photon with a momentum @xmath19 , @xmath27 is the lorentz - invariant matrix element for compton scattering@xcite , and @xmath28 is the lorentz - invariant phase space volume element of electrons with an energy of @xmath29 and a momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the left hand side of the equation is the total derivative of the photon distribution function in the phase space written as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32-th component of the direction cosines , @xmath33 , for a photon of four - momentum @xmath21 .",
    "the first two terms in the right hand side is a derivative along the photon path .",
    "the third term represents an effect of gravitational deflect of the photon path due to the cluster gravitational lensing effect .",
    "since the deflection angle due to the cluster gravitational lensing effect is at most @xmath34 , the change of the path length due to the lensing effect is at most 0.01pc and negligibly small compared with the cluster size of @xmath351mpc .",
    "the last term represents the cosmological redshift and the energy change of the photons due to the gravitational scattering by the tangential peculiar motion of the cluster@xcite .",
    "the gravitational scattering causes the cmb temperature fluctuation of @xmath36@xcite .",
    "the effect is order of magnitude smaller than the compton scattering effect concerned in this paper as shown in the next section .",
    "therefore , the terms representing the gravitational lensing effect and the gravitational scattering effect are neglected in the course of the following calculations .",
    "further , the cosmological redshift effect is neglected for simplicity since the effect is trivial@xcite .",
    "the right hand side of the boltzmann equation is the collision term .",
    "the first and the second terms are the contributions from scattering into and out of the momentum state @xmath19 including the stimulated emission effects , respectively . in the rest frame of the incident electron , the matrix element for compton scattering summed over polarization is given by , @xmath37 is the absolute value of the charge of the electron .",
    "the variables with @xmath35 denotes those in the electron rest frame , otherwise those in the laboratory frame .    as an example , the case when the electron velocity distribution function is the maxwell - boltzmann and the thermal energy contained in electron system is much less than the electron rest mass energy , is considered . by expanding the collision term of the boltzmann equation for isotropically distributed incident photons up to the second - order in electron momentum ,",
    "the kompaneets equation is deduced@xcite .",
    "the spectrum distortion of the cmb due to the compton scattering from thermal electrons contained in the clusters of galaxies are obtained by solving the kompaneets equation under the conditions that the probability of the multiple scattering of a photon is negligibly small and the electron temperature is much higher than the temperature of the cmb .",
    "this effect is known as the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( hereafter thermal sze ) @xcite .",
    "the spectrum distortion due to the plasma with a temperature gradient is deduced by the following way . in the plasma with a temperature gradient",
    ", the electron momentum distribution function is described as @xmath38 . since the multiple scattering of a photon is negligible in the clusters of galaxies , the effects of the spectrum distortion of the cmb due to the compton scattering from electrons belonging to @xmath39 and electrons belonging to @xmath2",
    "are decoupled .",
    "therefore , each effects can be evaluated separately and the total spectrum distortion is given by the superposition of each results .",
    "hereafter , the sze due to electrons belonging to @xmath2 is referred to gradt sze . since the first non - zero moment of the @xmath2 appears from the third - order moment , to evaluate the effect of the @xmath2 on the cmb spectrum distortion the third order expansion in electron momentum of the collision term of the boltzmann equation",
    "is required .",
    "the technical details are summarized in appendix . a final result of third - order expansion",

    "the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are treated as the order of @xmath50 variables .",
    "the spectrum of the gradt sze is obtained by inserting the planck function in the right hand side of the above obtained third - order boltzmann equation and integrating over line of sight .",
    "the frequency dependent amplitude of the distortion expressed in temperature is obtained as @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the line of sight integral .",
    "figure 1 compares the spectrum shape of the gradt sze with the thermal and kinetic sze@xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the frequency dependence of the kernel function @xmath53 to see diagnostics of the spectrum shape of the gradt sze compared with the thermal and kinetic sze@xcite .",
    "the spectrum shows distinct characteristics compared with others .",
    "therefore , the functional form of the non - maxwellian part can be measured by this spectrum shape of the gradt sze .",
    "it has a finite value at the cross over frequency of the thermal sze , that is 218ghz .",
    "the location of maxima , cross over frequency , and minima are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "they are at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "since the amplitude of the spectral distortion is proportional to the inner product of the @xmath33 with @xmath57 , the sign of the spectrum depends on the relative direction of the line - of - sight to the temperature gradient .",
    "when the hotter region locates closer to the observer , the amplitude of the distorted spectrum is larger than the cmb in the rayleigh - jeans part .",
    "a spherically symmetric system does not show the spectrum distortion due to the gradt sze since both of increment and decrement with the same amount appear in a single line - of - sight and these are cancelled out . when the line of sight is exactly perpendicular to the temperature gradient , there is no gradt sze effect .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum distortion due to the gradt sze at the peak frequency is evaluated by the following way .",
    "the line of sight integral in the right hand side of the equation is reduced to @xmath58 .",
    "it is independent from the electron density because the heat conductivity does not depend on the electron density explicitly unless it is saturated@xcite . as decreasing the electron density",
    "the coulomb mean free path becomes longer . in the region where the electron density is lower than @xmath59 with @xmath60kev ,",
    "the mean free path is longer than 2mpc@xcite .",
    "for the typical rich cluster , the electron density gets lower than @xmath59 in the region of 2mpc apart from the cluster center .",
    "therefore , in such a cluster out skirt the coulomb mean free path is longer than temperature gradient scales and the heat conduction is saturated .",
    "as modeled by the cowie and mackee ( 1977 ) , the saturated heat conductivity could be evaluated by the collisionless diffusion of the hot electrons with the maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the electron velocity distribution is the maxwellian in the cluster out skirt region where the heat conduction is saturated since the deviation of the velocity distribution function from the thermal equilibrium form is hard to be established without any collision between particles .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath61 in the cluster out skirt region where the heat conduction is saturated . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath62 disappears suddenly at the points where the electron coulomb mean free path becomes as long as the temperature gradient scale",
    ". the temperature of these transition points for the closer side and far side to the observer along the line - of - sight are denoted by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "then , the amplitude of the gradt sze is obtained as @xmath65 \\mu { \\rm k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result shows that the amplitude of the gradt sze is proportional to the heat conductivity . to extract the heat conductivity from the observed amplitude of the gradt sze , the electron temperature in the cluster out skirt at the both side of the line - of - sight have to be measured .",
    "since it is practically difficult , some assumptions must be made to extract the heat conductivity from the observed temperature map .",
    "the expected amplitude is two order of magnitude less than the thermal sze and an order of magnitude less than the kinetic sze but order of magnitude larger than the gravitational scattering effect . to distinguish the gradt sze signal from other sze signals , measurement of the spectrum by broad band or multi - band observations are required .",
    "the applications of the gradt sze to three different situations in clusters of galaxies are considered in this section .",
    "first case is that the plasma has a smooth distribution of density and temperature .",
    "second and third cases contain one discontinuity , such as a shock and a cold front along the line - of - sight , respectively .",
    "an idealized line - of - sight passing through clusters of galaxies is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the region denoted by @xmath66 is a discontinuity .",
    "the regions denoted by 1 and 2 are smooth regions .",
    "the outer edges of these regions are defined by the place where the heat conduction starts to be saturated ( cowie & mckee 1977 ; sarazin 1988 ) . for simplicity",
    ", the reduction rate of the heat conduction in these smooth regions , @xmath9 , is assumed to be constant through out the regions and suddenly becomes zero at each edges .",
    "the electron temperature at the edge of the discontinuity and at the outer edge of each smooth regions are denoted by suffixes @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "since the scale lengths of the discontinuities , @xmath68 , are comparable to or shorter than the coulomb mean free path , the reduction rate of the heat conduction in the discontinuities , @xmath69 , may be different from that in the smooth region and could be much less than 1 .",
    "the general expression for the amplitude of the gradt sze for the observer illustrated in figure 3 is obtained by performing the line - of - sight integral as @xmath70 \\\\ & & + f_{\\kappa}'\\left[t_e^d(2)^{7/2}-t_e^d(1)^{7/2}\\right ] -f_{\\kappa } \\left[t_e^o(1)^{7/2}-t_e^d(1)^{7/2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    * no discontinuity along a line of sight *    when there is no discontinuity along a line of sight , the reduction rate of the heat conductivity is constant through out the line of sight . by setting @xmath71 , the amplitude of the gradt sze at @xmath72ghz",
    "is reduced to @xmath73\\mu { \\rm k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the amplitude depends on the temperature at both outer edges of the smooth region and the heat conductivity in the smooth region .",
    "the amplitude is insensitive to any local variation of the temperature along line - of - sight . when the temperatures at the both outer edges are close to each other , the amplitude of the gradt sze becomes zero .",
    "* across a shock front *    although the electron distribution function in the cluster shock waves are quit uncertain , it is likely that the shock is collisionless and the thickness of the shock front is much smaller than the electron mean free path .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the heat conductivity in the shock waves is much less than that in the smooth region , e.g. @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitude of the gradt sze across a shock front at @xmath72ghz is reduced to @xmath75\\mu { \\rm k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effect comes from the difference of the electron temperatures at the both sides of the outer edges in the smooth regions is neglected .",
    "the adopted temperature of 30kev as the post shock gas temperature is somewhat larger than the average x - ray temperature of the cluster hot gas , that is 2 - 10kev .",
    "however , there are several observational and theoretical evidences which indicate that the temperature of the shock heated gas due to a cluster - cluster major merger could be as hot as 30kev .",
    "a cluster 1e0657 - 56 is an on - going merging cluster in which a contact discontinuity and a shock are identified ( markevitch et al .",
    "the temperature map of this cluster indicates the existence of the high temperature region hotter than 20kev .",
    "the combined analysis of the multi wave band sze mapping observations of the most x - ray luminous cluster rxj1347 - 1145 ( kitayama et al . 2004 ) showed that the inferred temperature of the south - east part of the cluster is well in excess of 20kev which is confirmed by the chandra x - ray temperature measurement ( allen et al .",
    "2002 ) . a numerical simulation of the head on collision of rich clusters ( takizawa 1999 ) showed that the shock heated gas temperature may temporary exceed 20kev .",
    "therefore , in such an ideal case , the amplitude of the gradt sze could be comparable to that of the kinetic sze .",
    "an important point we have to emphasize is that the amplitude of the gradt sze across the shock front is proportional to the heat conductivity in the smooth region .",
    "therefore , this observation can be used to measure the heat conductivity in the smooth region .    * across a cold front *    the thickness of cold fronts are yet unresolved .",
    "the current observed upper limits are comparable to the electron mean free path .",
    "since the cold fronts are found in relatively large fraction of clusters , the cold fronts should not be a short lived transient structure . to maintain the cold fronts ,",
    "the heat conductivity should be suppressed in many order of magnitude .",
    "it is likely that the heat conductivity in cold fronts is much less than unity , @xmath76 , and much less than that in the smooth region , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the gradt sze when the line of sight acrosses one cold front , is estimated as @xmath77\\mu { \\rm k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effect comes from the difference of the electron temperatures at the both sides of the outer edges in the smooth region is neglected .",
    "the dependence on the physical variables are the same as the case acrossing a shock . however , the temperature increase acrossing the cold front is not so significant since there is no thermalization of the kinetic energy as in the case of the shock .",
    "therefore , the expected amplitude is much smaller than the case of acrossing the shock .",
    "we have shown that the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photon with electrons in the icm which has a temperature gradient , results in a new type of the spectrum distortion of the cmb by the third - order perturbation theory of the compton scattering .",
    "the spectrum has an universal shape .",
    "the cross over frequency appears at 326ghz .",
    "the sign of the spectrum depends on the relative direction of the line - of - sight to the direction of the temperature gradient .",
    "when the hotter region locates closer to the observer , the intensity becomes brighter than the cmb spectrum in the frequency regions lower than the cross over frequency .",
    "therefore , the effect is distinguishable from other sze effects by broad band or multi - bands observations of the sze .",
    "the precise measurement of the spectrum shape of the gradt sze provides an unique opportunity to measure the non - maxwellian part of the electron velocity distribution function when the icm has a temperature gradient .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum distortion is proportional to the heat conductivity .",
    "it provides a possibility for a direct measurement of the heat conductivity .",
    "the expected amplitude of the gradt sze signal is more than two order of magnitude smaller than the thermal sze .",
    "the biggest signal for gradt sze occurs when the line - of - sight across a shock front .",
    "the expected signal for this case is as large as @xmath78k when @xmath79 at maximum .",
    "this is @xmath80 of the thermal sze .",
    "however , there are variety of the effects which distort the thermal sze spectra , such as the relativistic correction ( birkinshaw 1999 ) , the existence of the non - thermal electrons ( birkinshaw 1999 ) , the hydrodynamical effect of the cluster merger ( koch 2004 ) and the turbulent motion giving rised by merger shock ( nagai , kravtsov & kosowsky 2003 )",
    ". these can become problematic when using multi - frequency separation techniques .",
    "the gradt sze does not cause any polarization since the quadrapole moment of the cmb intensity distribution averaged over all the electron momentum is zero .",
    "the linear polarization of the compton scattered photons is generated by the systematic transverse motion of the electron system since it leads a finite quadrapole moment of the cmb intensity distribution in the frame moving with the same velocity as the transverse motion of the electron system@xcite . as explained in the section 1 and appendix , the first and second moments of the electron momentum on @xmath2",
    "are zero@xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 does not generate a quadrapole moment of the cmb intensity distribution .",
    "the third order doppler effect could provide the physical explanation of the spectrum distortion in the gradt sze although it is not satisfactory enough .",
    "the scattering can be treated as almost elastic in the electron rest frame , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "the transformation into the laboratory frame induces a doppler shift and an energy transfer to the photon amount of @xmath82 given as @xmath83 averaging over the incoming photon direction @xmath84 which is isotropically distributed , we obtain @xmath85 the averaging over electron velocity with velocity distribution function of @xmath62 results in @xmath86 where @xmath13 is the coulomb mean free path of electron , @xmath87 is the temperature gradient scale length and @xmath88 is the electron thermal velocity .",
    "this is an averaged fractional energy shift of the photon by a single scattering .",
    "when the hot region locates foreground of the cold region along the line of sight , the minus sign in the last equality is taken .",
    "the scattered photons lose their energy .",
    "therefore , the original planck spectrum shifts toward low frequency region contrary to the case of the thermal sze .",
    "this results in the increment in the rayleigh - jeans part and the decrement in the wien part contrary to the thermal sze . when the cold region locates foreground of the hot region , the plus sign in the last equality is taken .",
    "the scattered photons gain the energy . in this case , the original planck spectrum shifts toward high frequency region .",
