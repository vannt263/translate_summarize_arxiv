    "capillary forces due to capillary condensation and the formation of bridge phases  @xcite are other sources for the structural forces in the vicinity of the nematic - isotropic phase transition .",
    "if the fluid is confined to very narrow slits , patterning may give rise to capillary bridges of different liquid crystalline order .",
    "under such conditions , it would be interesting to study the stress under the shear strains by shifting the lateral substrate structures out of phase  @xcite which might give rise to rather strong lateral forces .",
    "lateral forces can technologically be used to align the parallel substrate structures .",
    "for instance , for those ranges of the model parameters for which the liquid crystalline lateral forces are significant , the liquid crystal can be filled into the slit pore to align the substrate structure and then be removed .",
