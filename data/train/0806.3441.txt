    "in this paper , it is our goal to use data from the complete survey of star - forming regions to assess and intercompare three methods for measuring column density in molecular clouds : near - infrared extinction mapping ; thermal emission mapping in the far - ir ; and mapping the intensity of co isotopologues .",
    "we wish we could offer a snapshot of _ volume _ density , as numerical modelers can , but volume density can not be mapped from our vantage point on earth without making very model - dependent assumptions .",
    "we discuss the position - position-_velocity _ distribution of material in other papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : here we focus solely on the column density distribution .",
    "our aim is to offer insight into the biases of particular techniques , and to provide the best estimates to date of  true \" column density distributions in molecular clouds suitable for comparison with current and future numerical simulations .",
    "we focus our discussion on the perseus molecular cloud complex , which covers nearly 10 square degrees on the sky ( @xmath4  pc@xmath5 at 250 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a companion paper to this one @xcite includes an historical perspective on the use of dust extinction and emission and of co isotopologue mapping to study column density in molecular clouds , and it offers an in - depth look at abundance variations in the cloud .",
    "in the past , three principal methods have been used to chart column density in molecular clouds : ( 1 ) * extinction * mapping , using either star counting ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or color - excess measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; ( 2 ) * dust - emission * mapping , at far - ir through mm  wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; and ( 3 ) mapping * integrated intensity of molecular - line emission * , usually @xmath2co  or @xmath3co  on large ( @xmath6  pc ) scales ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as noted above",
    ", there is a long history of the application of these techniques , and we analyze that history in @xcite .",
    "all three of these methods have now been applied , as part of complete , to the large ( @xmath7  deg@xmath5 ) swath of sky in perseus which has also been surveyed by the spitzer space telescope under the  cores - to - disks \" ( c2d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) legacy program .",
    "the perseus maps upon which the analysis in this paper rests can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the extinction map used here is presented in @xcite . to create the map , complete collaborators joo alves and marco lombardi , applied their  nicer \" ( near - infrared color excess method revisited ) method to 2mass near - infrared maps of perseus .",
    "as described in @xcite , the nicer algorithm calculates extinction values based on the difference between the _ observed _ average near - ir color of stars within a sampling box to the stars _ intrinsic _ average color . as the number of stars in a sampling box is reduced , the uncertainty in the extinction calculated by nicer rises .",
    "the details of the tradeoffs between high - resolution / high - uncertainty and low - resolution / low - uncertainty mapping with nicer is discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the nicer/2mass map used here is made with 5  resolution on a 2.5  grid , a common resolution to which all data presented in this paper have been smoothed .",
    "as shown in figure [ f1]a , we can measure extinctions from @xmath8 to 10 mag with typical reliability better than 0.25  mag ( figure [ f1]b ) , but it remains true that the highest uncertainties ( @xmath9  mag ) are in the highest extinction regions ( @xmath10  mag ) .",
    "even though 5  resolution sounds coarse ( especially compared with the 46  intinsic resolution of the complete spectral - line maps ) , it is important to appreciate that earlier , optically - based , extinction mapping methods could never come close to this kind of resolution in high column - density regions . in the @xmath11-band , for example , even modern star - counting techniques typically fail ( as zero stars are present in a counting box ) at @xmath12 mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the material with @xmath13 mag is exactly the material , when observed with the kind of few - tenths - of - a - pc resolution we have here , that appears most actively engaged in forming stars in perseus @xcite , and it is nearly completely opaque in optical wide - field surveys .",
    "we choose , at this point in time , to use the 2mass data for our extinction maps , rather than the spitzer irac c2d data for two reasons .",
    "first , the 2mass data cover the full region available in complete s molecular line maps , while the irac data only span  most \" of the region .",
    "second , and more importantly , work is still ongoing ( huard , private communication ) on the calibration of irac - based extinction maps and on the determination an agreed - upon mid - ir extinction law . in the future , the best extinction maps will likely be constructed from photometric observations spanning the nir and mir range .",
    "since the absorption by dust becomes progressively less severe at longer wavelengths , the mir data will be especially useful for mapping out the structure of very high column density gas .",
    "the far infrared data used here are taken from the iris ( improved reprocessing of the iras survey ) database @xcite .",
    "iris represents a substantial improvement over the earlier issa release of the iras survey , in that it has better zodiacal light subtraction , destriping , calibration and zero level determinations .",
    "the importance of finding and using the proper zero level when deriving column density maps where fluxes are not much higher than the noise is explained in @xcite . for iras - based observations of clouds like perseus ,",
    "the fir signal is typically only much greater than the noise above @xmath14  mag .    using the iris flux maps at 60 and 100 , we derive dust temperature and fir optical depth maps , as explained in @xcite .",
    "we use the 2mass / nicer column density map described in  2.1 to calibrate the conversion between fir optical depth and nir extinction .",
    "thus , we fix the overall column density scale with absorption measurements , and then adjust the dust emission properties , given derived color temperatures , to minimize differences beetween absorption and emission probes of dust column .",
    "( note that this procedure assures that the nir ( extinction ) vs. fir ( emission ) column desnity plots shown in figure  [ f3 ] have slope and intercept close to one and zero , respectively . ) by comparing figure [ f1]c , which shows the re - calibrated , iras / iris - derived",
    " equivalent @xmath15 \" column density map , to the 2mass / nicer map in figure [ f1]a , one can see that the point - to - point agreement is good , but far from perfect ( see  [ results ] ) .",
    "figure [ f1]d shows the derived color - temperature map ( from @xcite ) that is used in creating figure [ f1]c .",
    "note , as with the choice made for extinction maps , that we have not chosen to use spitzer maps of thermal emission in the present study .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented a full analysis of the long wavelength spitzer mips maps of perseus , in concert with the iras - based data used here .",
    "the spitzer map coverage is smaller than the iras ( all - sky ) coverage , and at the resolution of the present study , the results of @xcite show that the subtle differences between extinctions determined using 60 and 100 microns , and combinations at longer wavelengths are not critical to our analysis here ( see histograms in figure 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "the implicit assumption behind mapping column density using molecular line emission is that by integrating emission over all velocities , one can trace out all of the molecular gas along any particular line of sight .",
    "this assumption fails when either : 1 ) a molecular line is only excited under special physical conditions ; 2 ) emission from a particular line becomes optically thick ; and/or 3 ) the species used in an investigation does not have a constant abundance relative to molecular hydrogen . in reality ,",
    "any one and often all three of these are true ( see * ? ? ?",
    "but still , by making a prudent choice of molecular tracer , one can minimize these complicating conditions and use line maps to trace column density .    in the past",
    ", researchers @xcite have argued that @xmath3co , which is excited above volume densities @xmath16 @xmath17 ( column densities @xmath18  mag in nearby molecular clouds ) remains optically thin throughout  most \" of a molecular cloud s volume , and also remains of relatively constant abundance , except in very cold ( @xmath19 ) dense ( @xmath20  @xmath17 ) regions where carbon - bearing species are heavily depleted @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath3co  maps are used here as the most relevant molecular line tracer to compare with extinction maps and iris - based dust emission maps , which are also sensitive to material at or above about 1  mag .",
    "the full @xmath3co  map presented here was made for the complete survey at the five college radio astronomy observatory , and it is described in detail in @xcite . the full - resolution map was made in on - the - fly ( otf ) mode with the 32-element sequoia array , and contains nearly 200,000 independent 46  pixels . as noted above , we have smoothed the map to 5  resolution in order to match the column density maps described in  [ data - extinction ] and  [ data - far - ir ] above . after this",
    "smoothing , the average baseline rms in each of the resulting pixels is 0.027  k , and there are just over 3000 pixels ( in all the maps in figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "all points with signal - to - noise ratios ( based on peak / rms temperature ) below 5 in the smoothed map have been excised as less - than - reliable @xmath3co  detections .",
    "one of the most common , but not necessarily most accurate , ways to estimate molecular gas column density , @xmath21 , from @xmath3co  emission comes from : adjusting the velocity - integrated intensity of @xmath3co , @xmath22  @xmath23 , for telescope efficiency ; assuming a uniform excitation temperature ; and multiplying by a conversion factor that accounts for the ratio of @xmath24  to @xmath3co   ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    to make",
    "a more accurate calculation of @xmath25 one can employ measured kinetic temperatures and optical depths from @xmath2co  observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "because complete includes @xmath2co  as well as @xmath3co  maps , we can use the observed brightness temperature of @xmath2co  to estimate the excitation temperature ( assuming that @xmath2co  is optically thick ) , and then calculate a column density map assuming that the levels are populated following a boltzmann distribution .",
    "all maps and graphs relating to @xmath3co  column density distributions in this paper , unless explicitly labeled as  _",
    "w_(@xmath3co ) \" , are made in this way ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also assume a constant abundance , of @xmath26 , for @xmath24  relative to @xmath3co , even though some important variations in that ratio do exist , and are studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "figure [ f1]f shows the opacities derived from the same set of calculations that yields figure [ f1]e ( the column density map ) . the opacities , many of which significantly exceed unity , are well - correlated with the column density .",
    "once @xmath27 , any spectral line is no longer a very faithful column density tracer , even when we work arduously to correct for opacity .    in order to convert molecular column density , @xmath28 , to the ",
    "equivalent @xmath15 \" units used in this paper , we use the procedure outlined in @xcite , which gives : @xmath29 to facilitate comparison of the present analysis with previous work , @xcite assume a constant ratio of reddening to extinction , @xmath30 , equal to the measured average value measured for the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we note , though , that @xmath31 can have values up to @xmath32 @xcite , especially in high - density regions .",
    "lastly , we point out that the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) apply to _ perseus as a whole _",
    ", even though we measure them to vary by as much as @xmath33 from region to region within perseus @xcite .",
    "we discuss the significance of these regional variations in  [ regvar ] below .    in the bottom panel of figure [ f2 ]",
    ", we show both the @xmath22-based and the @xmath25-based histograms of column density . , but there are assumptions used to reach such units , which are explained in  [ data ] . ]",
    "notice that the @xmath22  distribution appears to underestimate the amount of material at low column density ( where temperature is typically higher ) and at very high column density ( where @xmath34 is high ) . even after accounting for temperature and opacity variations though",
    ", the @xmath25 distribution is still dangerous to interpret too literally , because at low @xmath15  ( @xmath353  mag ) the gas is sub - thermally excited , and at high extinction the optical depth is significantly larger than @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we quantify and discuss the uncertainties in molecular column density as compared with dust measurements below in ",
    "[ uncertainty ] .",
    "in order to restrict the comparison in this paper to reliable measurements of column density in the portions of molecular clouds _ not _ dominated by the localized heating and stirring caused by embedded massive stars we have excluded certain positions from all three data sets compared here .",
    "the  exclusion criteria \" are as follows .",
    "points not having reliable measurements in all three tracers are omitted . for @xmath2co  and @xmath3co  data ,",
    "we use only positions with signal - to - noise ( peak - to - rms ) ratios greater than 15 and 5 , respectively .",
    "note , though , that even with infinite sensitivity there would still be a minimum detectable column density for the line measurements , due to the fact that a critical density of matter is needed to excite co or @xmath3co  collisionally .",
    "( this  minimum \" density for excitation is what leads to the additive constant in the relationship between @xmath15  and @xmath25 shown in eq ..  ( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) .",
    "we also exclude any points where the fitted @xmath2co  line - width is smaller than 80% of the @xmath3co  line - width , because this is indicative of either : 1 ) multiple velocity components along the line of sight captured by one tracer but not the other ; or 2 ) of an unphysical result caused by marginal data quality .",
    "the ic348 and ngc1333 cluster regions are eliminated , using purely spatial cuts ( see black  holes \" in figure  [ f1 ] ) , from our analysis , because when material is heated non - uniformly from within , it is difficult to derive accurate column densities from either dust or gas emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also remove a small number of other pixels with stellar densities high enough ( in this case , @xmath37 stars / pixel ) to imply a significant contribution from stars embedded in perseus .",
    "this is necessary because nicer relies on  background \" stars for extinction mapping , and will underestimate extinction if embedded stars are included by accident .",
    "as indicated on the dust temperature map in figure [ f1]d , a heated shell surrounds the b - star hd 278942 , and portions of it overlap with our study region , in projection .",
    "the shell is actually located just behind the molecular clouds , and it apparently touches the clouds at a few localized points of contact ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figures  [ f1 ] and [ f3 ] ,",
    "we have marked the effects of the shell s low - density hot interior ( in pink ) , as well as of its over - dense heated rim ( in blue ) . in the histograms of figure  [ f2 ] and for",
    "the corresponding fits shown in table  [ fits ] , the points effected by the shell s interior and exterior have been _ excluded_. in figure  [ f3 ] , we show , for illustrative purposes only , the shell interior / exterior points in pink / blue , but we calculate the scatter amongst the different tracers _ excluding _ the shell points .",
    "lastly , positions close to the border of the map are removed when they would be effected by inaccurate convolution .    in summary ,",
    "all of the positions shown with non - null values in figure  [ f1 ] are shown in figure  [ f3 ] , but the points within the  shell \" regions are excluded from the histograms and fits in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "figure [ f2 ] compares , as histograms , the distributions of column density implied by the three different techniques ( extinction , thermal emission , and molecular lines ) under study here . to facilitate comparison with theories that predict a log - normal density distribution ( see  [ sim ] ) , the histograms are shown in linear - log space , where a log - normal appears as a gaussian .",
    "the log - normal least - squares fit to the 2mass / nicer - based extinction distribution is repeated ( in blue ) as a fiducial in all plots .",

    "figure [ f3 ] shows direct inter - comparisons of the all three column density measures : extinction , thermal dust emission , and gas emission .",
    "the overall scatter around the 1:1 lines can likely be attributed , in large part , to variations along the line of sight of : dust properties ; dust temperature ; and gas volume density ( which effects line emission ) .",
    "we explain below that the principal source of variation between the two dust tracers is variation in temperature along the line of sight ; while for comparisons between @xmath3co  and dust tracers , variations are caused by changes in the ratio of gas to dust along the line of sight .",
    "dust emission is dependent on temperature , but extinction is not . by applying radiative transfer calculations to numerical models of molecular clouds , @xcite showed that most of the scatter in comparing extinction and emission based column density measures is likely caused by line - of - sight variations in dust temperature . specifically , the scatter in the middle panel of figure [ f3 ] is directly modeled , and explained , by this effect in @xcite , so we will not discuss it further here .    to discuss the variations between dust- and gas - based measures of column density , we use figure  [ f6 ] , which shows a schematic diagram of gas and/or dust structures viewed from various vantage points .",
    "the general idea of a  dust - to - gas \" ratio is fine as long as one takes care to specify the _ volume _ over which that ratio is intended to apply . in other words , if clouds like those shown in the figure  [ f6 ] made up a whole galaxy , then summing all the dust and all the gas mass and dividing would be a fine and accurate expression of a volume - averaged dust - to - gas ratio . in our case , however , where we are interested in detailed pixel - by - pixel comparisons of column density measured with either dust or gas , plane - of - the - sky variations in the dust - to - gas ratio matter greatly , but are difficult to treat .",
    "the full  dust - to - gas \" ratio derivable from measurements of co isotopes and extinction relies on the wavelength dependence of extinction and on the abundance of co isotopes in the gas . as explained in ",
    "[ data - molecular - line ] and in @xcite , we assume in this paper that the wavelength dependence of extinction is constant ( as @xmath30 ) , and that the abundance of @xmath3co  is fixed for all of perseus , at the value corresponding to the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) .",
    "we make these assumptions in order to show how gas and dust maps would _ typically _ compare , as this approach , or an even less customized one , where dust - to - gas ratios and abundances from the literature are used without testing , is most common . in @xcite",
    "we give a detailed analysis of how much the calibration of dust - to - gas relationships ( @xmath3co  abundance ) varies amongst the sub - regions of perseus under both the linear approximation ( eq .  ( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) ) and also with a curve - of - growth approach .    the @xmath3co(1 - 0 ) transition is only excited above a certain critical density , and the transition to  lte \" levels of excitation is actually a gradual one .",
    "so , in figure [ f6 ] , we show some low - density dusty regions where @xmath3co  is not excited at all , some slightly - higher - density regions where it is sub - thermally excited , and some where the density is high enough for near - lte conditions .",
    "figure [ f6 ] clearly shows that while we can excise points with no @xmath3co  emission on the plane of the sky , we can not excise dust along the line of sight that would produce no @xmath3co  emission if viewed  from the side \" ( e.g. by the alien in the figure ) .",
    "if all lines of sight in a region were exactly the same as line - of - sight  a \" in figure [ f6 ] , then : 1 ) an equation for converting gas to dust column density like eq .",
    "( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) could be valid ; and 2 ) there would be no scatter in comparing dust and gas measures of column density .",
    "however , in a real cloud like perseus , some lines of sight pass through additional material that contains dust but does not emit in @xmath3co , as shown for line of sight  b \" in figure [ f6 ]",
    ". that additional material can be background or foreground to the cloud . or",
    ", it can be material within the cloud that is depleted or deficient in @xmath3co , for a variety of reasons .",
    "the @xmath3co  column densities given in this paper are calibrated using a single  typical \" conversion factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) , for all of perseus .",
    "this calibration makes the implicit assumption that the mixture of foreground / background / depleted / deficient material along lines of sight within perseus does not vary too much , which is not strictly true  and the scatter seen in figures  [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] is caused primarily by this assumption",
    ". note that since we _ know _ that the shell region ( highlighted using blue and pink in figures  [ f1 ] and [ f3 ] ) is unusual in both its temperature and for its apparent @xmath3co  deficiency ( see  [ paucity ] , below ) , it has been excised from all fits ( including the overall calibration ) and histograms ( figures [ f1 ] and [ f4 ] ) in this paper .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) has an additive factor corresponding to the typical minimum column density at which @xmath3co  is detected .",
    "this minimum is shown with dotted lines in figures [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] at @xmath42 . just as the slope of the gas - to - dust calibration does not universally apply to all lines of sight , neither will this minimum .",
    "as explained above , we have excised all positions with @xmath3co  levels below the minimum set by eq .",
    "( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) , but the remaining positions will sometimes give dust - derived extinctions below the gas - derived minimum . the biggest effect causing  leakage , \" beyond the low - density cutoff , which is partially responsible for the low - density tails seen in figures [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] ,",
    "is simply the scatter about the 1:1 relationships shown in figure [ f3 ] .",

    "as shown in @xcite , when one uses a more appropriate curve - of - growth fit , rather than a linear approximation , @xmath3co  integrated intensity typically rises _ more _ steeply than a linear fit to the same data would imply . as a result , a linear conversion ( eq .",

    "some of the positions creating the  low column \" tails shown in figures [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] are likely to actually be at the low column densities that dust measures : their column density is just overestimated by ( sub - thermally - excited ) @xmath3co .",
    "note , further , that the seemingly odd pile - up of @xmath3co  at densities just above the cutoff in figure [ f2 ] is similarly caused by the linear approximation s inability to properly treat sub - thermally - excited ( relatively low density ) gas .    to empirically estimate the scatter associated with all manner of variations in dust and gas properties ,",
    "we calculate the standard deviation of the distributions of the normalized differences between one column density measure and another at each point in the maps .",

    "the column density along lines of sight through the shell ( outlined in blue in figure  [ f1 ] ) has a molecular component , associated with the ( rest of the ) perseus star - forming region , plus a component associated with the shell which contains a lower fraction of molecular gas .",

    "one key point is that some of the tracer - to - tracer disagreement is caused by ( purposely ) using only a single co abundance , and a single form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : n13-lte ] ) in creating figure [ f4 ] .",
    "had we customized the calibration region - by - region , as is done in @xcite , we could improve the tracer - to - tracer agreement some , but then we would not be representing legitimate sub - sets of the same data shown in figure [ f1 ] through [ f3 ] .",
    "overall , @xmath3co  as a tracer seems most capricious , and we suspect that this is due to significant variations in physical conditions ( e.g. temperature , radiation field , region age ) other than ( column ) density that effect its abundance and excitation .    a subtler point concerning variations in distribution shape , both regionally , and tracer - to - tracer , concerns real variations in dust - to - gas ratio , in gas properties ( e.g. @xmath3co  abundance ) , and/or in dust properties ( e.g. @xmath31 ) .",
    "we know that these properties vary ( cf . ",
    "[ data - molecular - line ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even on the many - pc scales characteristic of the  regions \" we discuss here .",
    "so , they likely also vary on smaller scales , meaning that subtle changes in the shape of the distributions seen in figure  [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] would be apparent if we could account for these variations . in their paper on  can we trust the dust ? , \"",
    "* see also  [ reliability ] , below ) suggest that very small - scale variations ( @xmath52 pc ) variations in the dust - to - gas ratio may in fact exist .",
    "so , in the future , when we can carry out inter - comparisons of column density tracers on even smaller scales than those we consider in this paper , it will be interesting  and potentially important  to quantify how much the dust - to - gas ratio , as well as intrinsic gas and dust properties , change at various scales , and under various conditions .",
    "if we study only the nicer - based histograms in figure  [ f4 ] , which are not effected by calibration choices here , there are still very significant variations from region to region , and one is left wondering how sample ( region ) size effects the shape of one of these histograms .",
    "we consider this question , and others , in the context of numerical simulations , below .",
    "@xcite shows that for highly supersonic flows where gravitational and magnetic forces become negligible , the gas has a pressureless behavior . under these conditions ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations become scale invariant , i.e. , motions at all length and density scales obey the same equations . as a result , the probability density function of the volume density , @xmath53 , is expected to be log - normal .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that for essentially isotropic flows , the same kind of log - normal distribution results for either volume or for column density .",
    "these general predictions of turbulence theory inspire the log - normal fits shown in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "we do not suggest that any of the column density distributions we find here are necessarily best - fit by log - normals  we simply offer log - normal fits as a relevant comparison .    figures [ f1 ] and [ f4 ] straightforwardly show number ( figure  [ f1 ] ) and frequency ( figure  [ f4 ] ) distributions of @xmath54 .",
    "if , however , one wants to emphasize density _",
    "fluctuations _ about a mean , it makes sense to normalize the distributions by a mean column density .",
    "most numerical simulations , because they are often scale invariant , analyze this kind of  normalized column density , \" so to facilitate comparison , we define @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean value of column density in any map .",
    "the values of such means are given in table [ regions ] and shown as vertical long ticks in figure [ f4 ] for all the data sets considered here .",
    "we define the standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath57 as @xmath58 , which would equal the @xmath59 standard deviation of a gaussian fit to the distribution of @xmath57 in the case of a pure log - normal column density distribution .",
    "the values listed for @xmath58 in table [ regions ] are determined purely from the statistics of the distribution of @xmath57 values , though , and _ not _ from any kind of ( e.g. gaussian ) fit .",
    "some simulations have suggested that there may be measurable relationships amongst the mean and dispersion of the distribution of @xmath57 , mach number , mean magnetic field strength , and the ratio of forcing scale to cloud scale .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant of order 0.5 and @xmath62 is the sonic mach number of the gas . however , if a magnetic field is present , both @xcite and @xcite find that this relationship changes . in particular , @xcite find a secular trend in density contrast that depends on the fast magetosonic mach number , @xmath63 , which in turn depends on the sound speed and the alfvn speed .",
    "presently , region - by - region detailed measurements of field strength , needed to measure the alfvn and sound speed independently , are not available for any set of regions as large as those we study here , so it is hard to test this relationship directly with observations right now . however , a concerted effort to test predictions that rely on @xmath63 , perhaps using the chadrasekhar - fermi method to estimate field strengths over large areas , could and should be undertaken in the near future .    even if we could know field strengths though , it is still not the case , according to simulations , that a single realization of a turbulent flow can be inverted to give basic physical parameters , such as the exact power spectrum of density fluctuations in the flow .",
    "several researchers have shown that sub - samples of a single flow and/or multiple realizations of the same physical conditions will give noticeably different ( normalized ) column density distributions , similar to what is seen in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "there are a large number of modes present simultaneously in any simulation so one sample alone is unlikely to sample them all in their  average \" mixture .",
    "so , given that simulations demonstrate that a large(r ) sample of realizations would be needed to causally relate basic physical parameters to column density distributions , what can we learn from just the data we present in this paper about the physics of turbulent flows in star forming regions ?",
    "we can consider our set of  regional \" sub - samples as multiple realizations of the same  experiment \" we can call the  perseus molecular cloud . \" in one sub - sample , the  shell \" region , where the gas is dominated by an obvious driver not present in the other regions , we might dismiss any outlier - like behavior as due to  unusual \" forcing , and there is in fact a skewing of its column density distribution toward lower values , not seen in the other regions ( see figure [ f4 ] ) .    if the regional density distributions are truly drawn from an underlying distribution which is inherently log - normal , as predicted by many simulations , then @xmath64 simply because the mean ( first moment ) of a log - normal distribution of a quantity ( e.g. @xmath65 ) that is _",
    "normalized _ by its own mean should be unity .",
    "thus , figure [ f5 ] , which shows @xmath66 as a function of the mean @xmath57 for each region , appears to indicate that nearly all of the distributions we study in this paper are close to consistency with being drawn from a log - normal .",
    "note , however , that distributions similar in shape to a log - normal will also give a relationship very similar to eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) , so the fact that the points for our regions lie so close to the line should only be taken to mean that the distributions are close to consistent log - normal , and not exactly log - normal .",
    "the main purpose of figure [ f5 ] is to show all the values shown in table [ regions ] together , in a way that facilitates testing hypotheses relying on making comparisons .    if a relationship similar to eq .",
    "( [ paolobeta ] ) were satisfied , then moving up and right along the  perfect log - normal \" line in figure [ f5 ] would mean higher mach number in the hydrodynamic case , or possibly higher fast magnetosonic mach number ( as shown by @xcite , in their figure 4 ) .",
    "note that @xmath62 will rise if the sound speed drops , and @xmath63 will rise _ either _ if the magnetic field drops or if the sound speed drops , for a given density of material .",
    "we have tested whether a sonic mach number determined from observed line widths and ( dust ) temperatures listed in @xcite increases along the 1:1 line in figure [ f5 ] , and it does not .    making comparisons based on mach numbers calculated using only _ dust _ ( not gas ) temperature and _ line - of - sight _ velocity dispersion limits direct observation - simulation comparison in two important ways .",
    "first , we simply can not calculate @xmath63 ( as is used in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is likely more relevant than @xmath67 in comparisons , because we do not have field strength measurements .",
    "second , in observations , the observed column distribution arises from plane - of - sky compressions , whereas the line widths used to compute mach number come from the line - of - sight motions only .",
    "we consider how one might get around these limitations in the future in ",
    "[ future ] below .",
    "one important point to take away from observation - simulation comparisons concerns the sometimes - overlooked distinction between volume density and column density distributions .",
    "several simulators have pointed out that the _ column _ density distributions we show here will only look the same as the _ volume _ density distributions , which are usually predicted to be log - normal , when turbulence is dominated by large - scale motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the distributions look as close to log - normal as they do suggests that turbulence in perseus is primarily driven by motions on scales nearly the size of the whole cloud , or larger .      a similar relationship to the one shown in figure",
    "[ f5 ] , between the mean and dispersion in column density , has been used to explain and interpret the results of @xcite , who we believe were the first to find a relation between the standard deviation in measured extinction and the extinction value itself .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a relation like eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) can be caused by small scale structure below the resolution limit of an extinction map .",
    "@xcite performed a reanalysis of lada et al.s ic5146 observations , and find that the @xmath68 relation is consistent with a log - normal column density distribution producing unresolved density structure .",
    "later , @xcite used higher resolution observation in ic5146 by @xcite to compare the cumulative column density distribution with their own simulations finding that they are very similar in shape",
    ".    other extinction studies might provide notable exceptions to the  log - normal \" trend .",
    "for example , the pipe nebula s column - density distribution ( determined using the 2mass / nicer method ) displays a complex shape with multiple peaks @xcite .",
    "lombardi et al .",
    "attribute these peaks to the possibility of background clouds observed in projection with ( and thus in addition to ) the pipe at low galactic latitudes .",
    "recent c@xmath69o observations in the pipe @xcite have shown that there are two distinct velocity components there , and so it is possible that if those distributions could be separated , each would have a more log - normal - like column density distribution .    in general , it is important to consider what boundaries , in either spatial or velocity dimensions , are placed upon regions when assessing how common log - normal distributions might be . overlapping",
    " clouds \" along the line of sight may appear as one structure on the plane of the sky , and , without kinematic or distance information , it is hard to separate these structures . and",
    ", even if one can separate populations along a line of sight , the meaning of the region one considers on the plane of the sky needs to be understood as physically  small \" or ",
    "large \" in the context of a particular question , such as how  log - normal \" a distribution might be expected to look .",
    "recently , in a paper entitled  can we trust the dust ? \" , @xcite have raised questions about the reliability of nir extinction mapping , based on their finding that the power spectrum of a nir extinction map of the taurus region is significantly shallower than that derived from a @xmath3co  map of the same region . through detailed modelling , they rule out depletion of co , and/or co formation timescales as the cause(s ) of this discrepancy . by producing synthetic nir - extinction observations of simulations ,",
    "they show that the power spectrum derived from observations should trace the power spectrum of the actual spatial distribution of dust if the extinction is proportional to dust column density .",
    "@xcite argue that a discrepancy between the power spectra of the dust and the gas might be expected in the case of transonic , nonmagnetized turbulence .",
    "using @xmath3co  and nir data as we do here , but for taurus , they interpret a shallower power spectrum in dust fluctuations than in gas fluctuations as evidence for intrinsic spatial fluctuations in the dust - to - gas ratio , with amplitude increasing toward smaller scales .",
    "strictly , the @xcite work is only applicable at very small scales ( their estimate is @xmath52 pc ) .",
    "thus , the apparent disagreement between our results , which show the gas to be less reliable , and theirs which question the veracity of dust as a tracer of column density , may be only a question of scale .    on the other hand ,",
    "as shown by @xcite in perseus , the @xmath3co - dervied column density estimates are adversely effected by optical depth even at @xmath70  mag , and variation in the @xmath3co   abundance with respect to @xmath24  is found between regions in the same molecular cloud .",
    "these caveats in the interpretation of the @xmath3co   emission maps are not fully taken into account in the @xcite analysis ( which assumes @xmath3co  to trace density faithfully out to @xmath71  mag ) , and may also explain the apparent disagreements  both between gas and dust , and between our results and  can we trust the dust ? . \"",
    "we have clearly demonstrated , in every figure in this paper , that gas - based and dust - based measures of column density almost never agree perfectly in detail .",
    "so , instead of  can we trust the dust ? \" , one might ask instead  should we sass the gas ? \" . as we discussed in  [ uncertainty ] , dust and gas measures are virtually never tracing exactly the same portions of any particular line of sight , so some amount of  disagreement \" when inter - comparing tracers has to be expected .",
    "it also has to be recognized , though , that any particular molecular transition can only trace a ( sometimes very ) limited range of volume densities , which is effectively bounded at bottom by the critical density and at top by depletion and/or opacity . because it is hard to know the real density range to which a line is sensitive , and to model how linear the conversion from line flux to density is likely to be , gas really does deserve some degree of sassing if one wants to tease its ability to trace column density cleanly .",
    "dust , however , is not perfect either . for extinction - based measures , variations in the compositional and size distribution of grains can effect the reddening law . and , for emission - based measures , variations in grain temperature along the line of sight are impossible to correct for and so impose unavoidable uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the principle advantage of dust over gas is dynamic range .",
    "no single observation of a gas tracer can sample more than about a factor of a about ten in column density , but , dust - based measurements can span a dynamic range of 50 or ( much ) more .",
    "for example , in the famous b68 globule , observations of _ extinction _ span the range @xmath72 to 27 mag @xcite while c@xmath69o ranges from 0.2 to 0.8 k km  s@xmath73  and then depletes , and n@xmath74h@xmath75 , which only is detected above about @xmath15  of 10 , spans the range 0.3 to 2.1 k km  s@xmath73  . in tmc-1c , thermal dust _",
    "emission _ allows for a dynamic range of nearly 25 in @xmath15   ( from 4 to 90 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but none of the many lines mapped there has a dynamic range of more than ten @xcite .",
    "extinction measures will always saturate at some high value of extinction where background sources can not be detected , and emission is often limited in utility at very low extinctions , due to low flux levels and/or observational strategies ( e.g. chopping ) that make mapping extended emission difficult . in cases where one can can cross - calibrate extinction and emission using maps of regions where they should give the same information , one can stretch the dynamic range of  dust \" to its fullest by using extinction as the sole probe at low column densities , emission alone at the higher ones , and both extinction and emission in the intermediate regime .    in the maps of perseus in this paper",
    ", we have excised points with no @xmath3co  emission , but our dust measures still can trace low - density material along those lines of sight that _ do _ emit in @xmath3co  ( see  [ uncertainty ] and figure  [ f6 ] ) . in figure 6 of @xcite",
    "we show the dust - based column density distributions for all of perseus , without limiting ourselves to @xmath3co - emitting regions .",
    "those distributions look similar to the ones in figure  [ f2 ] , except that they show a longer high - density tail , caused in large part by _ not _ excluding all of the high - density cluster regions ngc1333 and ic348 .",
    "it is very important to realize that our excision of plane - of - the sky points with no @xmath3co  here does _ not _ exclude low - column regions traced by dust along the line of sight , which is why the distributions in figures  [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] look more symmetric ( not cut - off at the low end ) for the dust measures than for @xmath3co .        from the discussion above , we may sound ready to recommend dust as the single best tracer of column density in interstellar space ",
    "but we are not .",
    "we can not forget that the total ( gas + dust ) column density in any region can only be as accurate as the gas - to - dust conversion factor used . and",
    ", since all interstellar regions contain much more gas than dust , a small error in a dust - dervied column will be compounded when converted to total column .",
    "therefore , we recommend a ",
    "holistic \" approach to measuring column density .",
    "we need to take account of the level of uncertainty inherent in each conversion factor ( e.g. abundance ratio , reddening - to - extinction ratio , dust opacity , dust - to - gas ratio ) and assumption ( e.g. about line of sight structure ) we use in a column density calculation , and then we need to choose the best solution for each particular question . for example , in a circumstance where we are relatively confident that the dust - to - gas ratio is not varying , and that line - of - sight blending is not causing confusion , then extinction maps will provide the best handle on the kind of relative column density measurements needed to measure key distribution functions , such as  clump \" mass functions . on the other hand , in a region where the dust - to - gas ratio is very uncertain ( e.g. near an hii region ) using molecular line ratios to measure volume density and opacity and converting",
    "to column density may be superior .",
    "in other words , we recommend that more care than has been typical in the past be given to making the _ most appropriate _ choice in any particular study .",
    "lastly , several recent studies have shown that  observing \" simulations using radiative transfer and/or chemistry codes , and synthetic telescopes that mimic biases imposed by real ones ( an approach we have called  taste - testing \" ) can sometimes uncover hidden limitations and biases associated with certain techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if a realistic simulation can be observed synthetically with various column density probes , it can provide a good guide to which kind(s ) of column density measures might be least biased under relevant conditions .        * the column density distribution of material in the full perseus star - forming region , with @xmath76 mag , is roughly log - normal , when it is not directly effected by embedded clusters or young stellar outlows ( bipolar or spherical ) .",
    "* dust is superior to molecular lines for tracing out the  full \" mass distribution over the range of extinction studied , because it does not require a threshold density to  excite \" and it does not die out at high densities due to high opacity or chemical depletion , the way @xmath3co  does . *",
    "the dearth of molecular gas ( @xmath3co ) in the region corresponding the shell created by the b - star hd 278942 suggests that either co has not yet formed in this young structure , and/or that existing molecular gas has been dissociated by the shell s interaction with the cloud .",
    "* when perseus is dissected into smaller  sub - regions , \" the column density distributions become more ragged , as is predicted by simulations for samples that are statistically small .",
    "however , we find that the sub - regions distributions are still log - normal - like , in that the relationship between their normalized means and their dispersions follows a trend consistent with log - normal distribution . * in comparing observations of column density ( or mass ) distributions with each other , and/or with simulations , it is perhaps more important than has been previously appreciated to account for the effects of biases due to dust temperature variations , abundance variations , opacity effects , and observing strategies .",
    "we recommend , for the near - term future , the assemblage of an ensemble of maps of column density , along with measurements of mach number and magnetic field strength , in order to assess the turbulent properties of molecular clouds and star - forming regions more generally .",
    "this large sample is needed to allow for legitimate comparisons between regions , and of observations with simulations , because any one observation of even the same turbulent flow is not enough to characterize the flow s statistical nature .",
    "with such a large sample , we could carry out much more discriminating comparative analyses than the kind represented by figure [ f5 ] , which focuses only on testing whether the conditions relating the mean ( first moment ) of a distribution to its width ( second moment ) are correct .",
    "we could , for example , begin to investigate the skewess of these distributions , and to investigate alternative functional forms , which may in fact not be exactly log - normal . with this larger sample",
    ", we could also study the effects of star - formation as a driver of the turbulence , and again compare with simulations of this process .",
    "the combination of : 1 ) extensive recent improvements in extinction mapping made possible by large - scale near - infrared surveys ; 2 ) the advent of huge molecular line surveys of relatively high - density tracers ; and 3 ) increases in polarization mapping speed ( which leads to chandrasekhar - fermi - based field estimates ) , should very soon allow for studies large enough to test predictive theories and simulations of molecular cloud topology using unprecedentedly large observational statistical samples , and we look forward to it .",
    "this paper was originally inspired by a workshop at the aspen center for physics in the summer of 2004 on  star formation in galaxies , \" where it seemed that the assembled audience of experts could not agree on the least biased way to measure the  initial conditions \" for stars to form from molecular gas .",
    "a conversation with eve ostriker at that meeting , about how observations and simulations of star - forming molecular gas might best be compared , was particularly important .",
    "the quest to offer the most bias- and error - free column density distributions we could publish based on the complete data in this paper took nearly four years , and it spawned several other papers by our group @xcite the  2007 \" version of these distributions and their implications were discussed intensively at the kitp santa barbara workshop on  star formation near and far , \" and we deeply thank eve ostriker , paolo padoan and enrique vazquez - semadeni for their comments both at and since that meeting .",
