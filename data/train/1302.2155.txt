    "the surface gravity cut selects asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars in addition to the rgb stars we are interested in finding . to further isolate rgb stars , we chose only stars with color @xmath64 from the velocity - selected sample shown in figure  [ spectra_cmd ] ( light blue points ) , and histogrammed their metallicities in the upper panel of figure  [ hist ] . because the off - stream field has many more stars than the on - stream selection",

    "we identify this as the pss metallicity signature ; this is the reason for the metallicity selection of @xmath31  [ fe / h ]  @xmath25 for the red points in figure  [ spectra_cmd ] .",
    "we performed a similar procedure to find the velocity of stream candidates .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ hist ] shows velocities of metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath70 ) red giants , with the off - stream number counts scaled down by a factor of 3.16 so that the number of red giants with [ fe / h]@xmath65 is equal in the two samples .",
    "again , we subtracted the scaled off - stream histogram from the on - stream data , and fit a gaussian to the residuals .",
    "the fit ( shown as a dotted curve in figure  [ hist ] ) gives @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .    having confirmed the presence of a population of stars having common velocity and metallicity , we next examine the photometric data in this region of the sky to look for additional evidence of the substructure .",
    "we selected all stars with photometric data from the sdss dr8 database , within the on- and off - stream fields described above .",
    "we created cmd hess diagrams for both the on- and off - stream fields using extinction - corrected @xmath50 magnitudes and @xmath51 colors .",
    "the hess diagram for the off - stream field was normalized by dividing number counts in each bin by 8 to account for the @xmath73 larger area relative to the on - stream region .",
    "we subtracted the normalized off - stream hess diagram from that of the on - stream field to create a difference plot .",
    "the residuals from this subtraction can be seen in the bottom left panel of figure  [ spectra_cmd ] .",
    "figure  [ spectra_cmd ] ( lower panels ) reveals an overdensity of stream stars between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , consistent with a population of f - turnoff stars from the stream whose velocity signature we have found in rgb stars .",
    "the turnoff magnitude is clearly fainter than that of the 28 kpc isochrone , and appears more likely to be between the 33-kpc and 38-kpc isochrones .",
    "since the stars are in a narrow line across the sky , we surmise that the turnoff stars and spectroscopically selected rgb stars are part of an old , metal - poor tidal stream at a distance of @xmath76 kpc .",
