    "as shown by wmap observations @xcite , within a half billion years after the big bang the universe must have given birth to numerous radiation sources , that by @xmath0 reionized most of the gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "however , the nature of these sources remains a puzzle .",
    "miniquasars , pop ii and iii stars , supernovae , and many others have been suggested as the main engines of reionization @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , direct observations may not be able to distinguish between the different types .",
    "for most , the low - energy part of the spectrum has the same thermal shape , @xmath1 , while the upper part , @xmath2 ev is absorbed or scattered by the neutral igm .",
    "however , as we show in this paper , it is still possible to measure the shape of the upper part of the spectrum , from the source imprint on the 21-cm signal of the surrounding neutral igm .",
    "when at redshift @xmath3 the hydrogen spin temperature , @xmath4 , is different from the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , @xmath5 , the cmb brightness temperature presently observed at the wavelength @xmath6 cm changes by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the local overdensity and @xmath9 is the ionized hydrogen fraction .",
    "the spin temperature is determined by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kinetic temperature , @xmath12 is a constant proportional to the collisional excitation rate ( see zygelman ( 2005 ) and liszt ( 2001 ) for the contribution of neutral atoms and electrons to the collisional pumping ) and @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the oscillator strength of the ly@xmath16 transition , @xmath17 is the spontaneous emission coefficient of the hyperfine transition , @xmath18 is the radiation intensity at the far red wing of the ly@xmath16 resonance ( where the intensity of uv photons is unaffected by scatterings ) and @xmath19 is a correction factor , which for the unperturbed igm is given by @xcite @xmath20 several authors have previously explored the ways @xmath4 can be decoupled from @xmath5 by the first radiation sources .",
    "nusser ( 2005 ) has pointed out that , since charged particles have a much higher cross - section for collisionally de - exciting the hyperfine transition , @xmath4 can be decoupled from @xmath5 in moderately overdense partially ionized regions ( which may be produced by an x - ray source or following the recombination of a fully ionized hii region ) . in this way a miniquasar with luminosity @xmath21 can decouple the gas within a few hundred comoving kiloparsec @xcite .",
    "cen ( 2005 ) considered a massive starburst in the first galaxies that produce a strong uv background . in his model @xmath4",
    "is decoupled from @xmath5 by the photons slightly on the blue side of the ly@xmath16 resonance that redshift into the resonance within some distance ( typically up to a few comoving mpc ) from the source . however , in this paper we show that in all of the above systems the spin temperature is dominated by locally emitted ly@xmath16 photons that can be produced in three different ways ( collisional excitation , recombination , or cascade ) . including these photons in the calculation not only boosts the intensity of the signal ( by orders of magnitude for the x - ray sources ) , but makes a qualitative change in its radial profile .    in  2 , 3 and 4",
    "we recalculate the 21 cm signal from the systems discussed above ( x - ray and uv sources , and recombining hii regions ) .",
    "in  5 and  6 we consider the signal produced by galactic winds and short - lived radiation sources , respectively . in  7 we summarize our results .",
    "after traveling an average comoving distance of @xmath22 through the neutral gas , an x - ray photon gets absorbed by an atom . a high energy electron produced by the absorption scatters with other atoms , electrons , and protons , thereby depositing its energy into heat , secondary ionizations , and atomic excitations .",
    "shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) showed that the division of energy depends on the ionized fraction @xmath9 , with @xmath23 $ ] of the total going to heat , @xmath24 to ionizations and @xmath25 to excitations of hydrogen atoms .    on the basis of these results we find that when the initial ionized fraction is low ( as it is for the primordial gas after @xmath26 ) and temperature is below @xmath27 k , the x - rays increase @xmath11 and @xmath9 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average energy deposited per atom .",
    "the heating rate and intensity of ly@xmath16 photons produced by deexcitations of hydrogen atoms , at a distance @xmath30 from the x - ray source , is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the source luminosity at frequency @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the hydrogen atom number density .    assuming that the spectrum of high - redshift x - ray sources is similar to `` ultraluminous '' x - ray sources in nearby galaxies , @xmath35 for @xmath36 kev @xcite , we can transform eqs .",
    "[ dt ] and [ ja ] into @xmath37 where @xmath38 is given in myrs .",
    "figure 1a shows the evolution of 21-cm brightness temperature .",
    "close to the source , where the gas is heated above @xmath39 , @xmath40 is positive . farther out",
    "the gas becomes colder , so that @xmath40 becomes negative .",
    "still farther out , the pumping radiation becomes too weak to decouple @xmath4 from @xmath39 , and @xmath40 approaches a small limiting value that is given by collisional coupling only .",
    "the decoupling of the spin temperature may also be done by radiation sources that emit a significant fraction of their energy in the range between ly@xmath16 and ly - limit frequencies . unlike ionizing photons",
    ", photons in this range can travel freely through neutral hydrogen , until they are redshifted into one of the atomic resonances . with the exception of photons that are very close to the ly - limit , which may skip one or more resonances , most of these photons are first scattered when the closest resonance is reached .",
    "thus , only photons emitted between ly@xmath16 and ly@xmath41 frequencies reach the ly@xmath16 resonance , which they leave only after @xmath42 scatterings .",
    "by contrast , photons emitted above the ly@xmath41 frequency typically scatter only a few times before being destroyed by cascading to lower levels .",
    "a fraction of resonant photons destroyed by cascade ( 0 for ly@xmath41 , 0.26 for ly@xmath8 and @xmath43 for higher resonances ) produce ly@xmath16 photons as one of the cascade products @xcite . since the frequency range between the ly@xmath44 and ly - limit is @xmath45 times smaller than that between ly@xmath16 and ly@xmath41 , ly@xmath16 photons produced directly through redshifting are generally more numerous than those produced by cascade .",
    "however , the latter photons are typically produced within a much shorter distance from the source ( on average the photon between @xmath46 and @xmath47 resonance travels a distance of @xmath48 before reaching a resonance ) , which makes them a dominant pumping mechanism within a few mpc from the source . including these photons in the calculation not only boosts the pumping radiation intensity , but also changes its radial profile . whereas normally the radiation intensity is proportional to @xmath49 , the cascades change this dependence to approximately @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , they also result in the discontinuous jumps in pumping radiation intensity and 21 cm brightness signal at @xmath51 .",
    "figure 1b shows the radial profile of 21-cm brightness temperature of the unheated igm around uv sources . in principle",
    ", the resonant scatterings affect the gas temperature , which therefore becomes time- and position - dependent @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the x - ray photons , the uv resonance photons generally gain or lose only a very small fraction of their energy in exchange with the gas , so in figure 1b we neglect this energy transfer .",
    "the low - mass galaxies that are first to form in the standard @xmath52cdm model are expected to be very vulnerable to feedback . during brief and intensive periods of star formation",
    ", such galaxies may be completely disrupted by sn explosions or photoevaporation .",
    "furthermore , reionization may also delay gas accretion and star formation in the neigbouring halos .",
    "consequently , the h ii regions produced by the first galaxies may be given a pause , allowing them to cool and recombine .",
    "unless the gas is extremely overdense , its thermal evolution as it recombines is determined mainly by inverse compton cooling and radiative recombination . right after ionization",
    "the temperature of the gas in the igm depends on the shape of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "if the shape changes appreciably during the life - time of the ionizing source or if the source life - time is smaller or comparable to the gas cooling or recombination times , this would be reflected in the radial profile of the gas temperature and ionized fraction .",
    "also , a strong jump in both temperature and ionized fraction can be produced across a he ii ionization front . even after the radiation source is dead",
    ", the difference in the ionized fraction inside and outside a former he iii region would persist for quite a long time .    figure [ hii1 ] shows the evolution of the 21cm signal from the recombining h ii region , produced at @xmath53 by a short - lived source whose spectrum is similar to a black body with a surface temperature of @xmath54 k. initially the gas brightness grows almost linearly with the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "subsequently , when the ionized fraction falls below @xmath55 , the intensity of ly@xmath16 photons ( which dominate over collisional coupling for @xmath9 above @xmath56 ) produced by recombinations is insufficient to fully decouple @xmath4 from @xmath39 , and , unless additional ly@xmath16 photons are provided by exterior radiation sources , the signal may drop .",
    "even though large numbers of ly@xmath16 photons may be produced by the overdense gas in galaxies via recombination or excitation of hydrogen atoms , these photons do not typically affect the 21 cm emission in the neighbouring igm , as they redshift out of resonance close to their origin .",
    "this limitation , however , may be bypassed if the peculiar velocity of the gas is very large .",
    "ly@xmath16 photons emitted by a medium moving with peculiar velocity @xmath57 may reenter the resonance within @xmath58 from the point of origin .",
    "large peculiar velocities involving a large mass of gas may indeed be generated by one or more supernovae explosions @xcite .    a wind expanding with velocity @xmath59 that exceeds 100 km / s shockheats and compresses the surrounding gas into a thin shell .",
    "the cooling in the outer parts of the shell , where the temperature is above @xmath60 k , is dominated by inverse compton scatterings and bremsstrahlung . in the inner parts , where the temperature drops below @xmath61 k ,",
    "most of the energy is radiated away in ly@xmath16 photons . by considering a thin shell expanding with velocity @xmath59 at a radius @xmath62",
    ", we find the distribution of the photons that are at resonance in the local gas frame to be @xmath63^{-1/2 } .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure 1c shows the 21 cm signal produced by a galactic wind for different radiation intensities .",
    "apart from supernovae , thin shells expanding with large peculiar velocities can be produced by large voids forming from steep initial density perturbations .",
    "the distribution of ly@xmath16 photons produced by such shells can still be described by equation [ lw2 ] .",
    "however , in this case the ratio @xmath64 ( which for shells driven by supernovae can be very large ) is typically between @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "in the examples given in the previous sections , we have neglected the possible time - dependence of the luminosity of radiation sources . however ,",
    "if the luminosity changes over a relatively short time - scale , this will be reflected in the 21-cm signal .",
    "since the speed of light is finite , regions that are observed simultaneously are pumped by photons emitted at different times .",
    "therefore , by measuring the 21cm signal from different regions around the source , it is possible to reconstruct the evolution of the source spectrum and intensity .",
    "figure [ lymtd ] illustrates the evolution of the 21-cm profile after a starburst that lasts a few million years .",
    "we have shown that different radiation sources produce distinctly different 21-cm profiles , which can be sensitive not only to the source spectrum , but also to its history (  2 and 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , differences can also be identified in the combined signal from multiple radiation sources of different types .",
    "figure [ spec ] shows the power spectrum of the 21-cm signal produced by either the x - ray or the uv sources contributed by a biased distribution of halos ( the power spectrum calculation is based on the formalism developed by barkana & loeb ( 2005a ) ) .",
    "predictably , the x - ray sources , which typically influence smaller regions , produce greater fluctuations on small scales than do pop iii uv sources .",
    "this difference between x - ray and uv can be even larger if pop iii is replaced with pop ii stars , which produce lower proportion of higher n resonance photons ( barkana & loeb 2005b ; pritchard & furlanetto 2006 ) .    assuming that at @xmath67 the typical distance between the first radiation sources is a few mpc , their individual detection requires an angular resolution of about one arcminute ( or baseline of @xmath68  15  km ) and frequency resolution of @xmath69  khz . for a beamwidth and bandwidth",
    "just small enough to resolve such objects , a detection of an x - ray source with @xmath70 erg / s ( which equals the luminosity of one or more black holes of total mass @xmath71 shining with eddington luminosity ) requires a sensitivity of @xmath72  m@xmath73k@xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the integration time .",
    "thus it appears that ska , whose planned sensitivity is a few times @xmath76  m@xmath73k@xmath77 at the relevant frequencies , would be able to detect such x - ray sources individually .",
    "the detection of the fluctuating 21-cm background produced by the superposition of the first sources is even more promising .",
    "for example , the curves in figure [ spec ] can be easily distinguished at scales @xmath78  mpc@xmath77 by lofar , ska , or past for 4 weeks of integration time ( see zaldarriaga , furlanetto , & hernquist 2004 for details on power spectrum error estimation ) .",
