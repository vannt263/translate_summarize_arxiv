    "the prediction @xcite and realization @xcite of current - induced switching of magnetization direction in epitaxial magnetic multilayers stimulated huge research activity related to high - density writing of information .",
    "the simplest systems for this purpose are spin valves nm / fm1/nm / fm2/nm with two ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers ( fm1 , fm2 ) separated by a non - magnetic ( nm ) spacer layer and attached to semiinfinite nm metallic leads .",
    "the electric current perpendicular to the layers becomes spin - polarized on passing the fm1 layer with a fixed magnetization direction . in non - collinear spin valves , subsequent reflection and transmission of spin - polarized electrons at the fm2 layer results in a spin torque acting on its magnetization the direction of which can thus be changed .",
    "majority of existing experimental and theoretical studies of these spin - transfer torques refer to a diffusive regime of electron transport in metallic systems , see ref .   for a review .",
    "magnetic tunnel junctions with the nm spacer layer replaced by an insulating barrier have attracted attention only very recently ; in these systems voltage - driven spin - transfer torques @xcite as well as effects of finite bias @xcite can be studied .",
    "the concept of torkance , defined in the small - bias limit as a ratio of the spin - transfer torque and the applied voltage , @xcite represents an analogy to the conductance .",
    "it becomes important also for all - metallic spin valves with ultrathin layers @xcite where a ballistic regime of electron transport can be realized .",
    "the latter regime is amenable to fully microscopic , quantum - mechanical treatments .",
    "all existing theoretical approaches to the torkance , both on model @xcite and _ ab initio _",
    "@xcite levels , are based on a linear response of various local quantities inside the spin valve to the applied bias .",
    "the local quantities used range from scattering coefficients of the individual layers @xcite over local spin currents @xcite to site- and orbital - resolved elements of a one - particle density matrix .",
    "@xcite these methods contrast the well - known landauer picture of the ballistic conductance @xcite which employs only transmission coefficients between propagating states of the two leads .    in this paper , we present an alternative theoretical approach to ballistic torkances that yields a result similar to the landauer conductance formula , i.e.",
    ", we relate the torkance to scattering coefficients of the whole spin valve .",
    "this unified theory of both transport quantities is used to discuss a special consequence of ballistic transport , namely , a predicted oscillatory dependence on ni thickness in a cu / co / cu / ni / cu(001 ) system .",
    "the presented study reveals a relation between the torkance and the properties of individual parts of the spin valve which might be relevant for design of new systems .",
    "our approach is based on an effective one - electron hamiltonian of the nm / fm1/nm / fm2/nm system , @xmath0 where @xmath1 comprises all spin - independent terms , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote magnitudes of exchange splittings of the fm1 and fm2 layers , respectively , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are unit vectors parallel to directions of the exchange splittings , and the @xmath6 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "the spin torque @xmath8 is defined as time derivative of the electron spin , represented ( in units of bohr magneton ) by operator @xmath9 . this yields",
    "( with @xmath10 ) the total spin torque as @xmath11 =    \\bm{\\tau}_1 + \\bm{\\tau}_2 ,   \\label{eq_tdef}\\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath12 can be interpreted as torques experienced by the two fm layers .",
    "obviously , the torque @xmath13 is perpendicular to the vector @xmath14 and it can thus be decomposed with respect to the common plane of the two magnetization vectors into its in - plane ( @xmath15 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath16 ) components , see fig .  1 for @xmath17 .",
    "the unit normal vector of the plane is given by @xmath18 .    ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath19 ) components of the torque @xmath20 experienced by the fm2 layer .",
    "for details , see text . ]",
    "the basic idea for the in - plane torkance on the fm2 layer rests on the orthogonality relations @xmath21 , @xmath22 , from which the size of @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 see fig .  1 .",
    "the total torque @xmath8 , being a full time derivative of @xmath9 , in ( [ eq_tau2 in ] ) plays a key role in the following treatment .",
    "our approach applies to systems consisting of the left ( @xmath25 ) and the right ( @xmath26 ) semiinfinite nm leads with an intermediate region ( @xmath27 ) in between ; the latter contains both fm layers and the nm spacer of the spin valve .",
    "projection operators on these regions are denoted respectively as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; they are mutually orthogonal and satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq_hdef ] ) is assumed to be short - ranged ( tight - binding ) , not coupling the two leads , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "the leads are in thermodynamic equilibrium at zero temperature .",
    "a general linear response theory can be formulated for a hermitean operator @xmath33 that is local , i.e. , not coupling neighboring parts of the system , so that @xmath34 . its time derivative @xmath35   \\label{eq_ddef}\\ ] ] is assumed to be localized in @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "these properties make it possible to remove the semiinfinite leads from the formalism .",
    "the resulting response coefficient describing the change @xmath37 of the thermodynamic average of the quantity @xmath38 due to an infinitesimal variation @xmath39 of the chemical potential ( fermi energy ) of the @xmath25 lead is given by @xmath40 where the trace ( tr ) and all symbols on the r.h.s .",
    "are defined on the hilbert space of the intermediate region @xmath27 , in particular the @xmath41 in ( [ eq_rcd ] ) abbreviates @xmath42 .",

    "this is the case of the usual particle conductance and of the in - plane torkance ( see below ) .",
    "the out - of - plane torkance requires a different approach based on the more general relation ( [ eq_vard ] ) , see section  [ ss_ooplt ] ; its symmetry properties for symmetric spin valves were discussed in details , e.g. , in ref .  .",
    "application of the derived formula ( [ eq_rcd ] ) to the transport properties of the spin valves is now straightforward .",
    "the usual particle conductance @xmath56 is based on the operator @xmath41 being a projector on a half - space containing , e.g. , the @xmath26 lead and an adjacent part of the @xmath27 region .",
    "this results in the well - known expression @xcite @xmath57 where atomic units ( @xmath58 ) are used .",
    "the in - plane torkance @xmath59 on fm2 according to ( [ eq_tau2 in ] ) is obtained from @xmath60 in ( [ eq_rcd ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath61 , where @xmath62 the two terms on r.h.s .",
    "can be related to spin fluxes on two sides of the fm2 layer .",
    "the expression ( [ eq_tinvgf ] ) represents our central result .",
    "the operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 are localized in narrow regions at the interfaces @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the green s functions ( propagators ) for points deep inside the spin valve thus enter neither the conductance ( [ eq_cvgf ] ) , nor the in - plane torkance ( [ eq_tinvgf ] ) .      a similar approach for the out - of - plane torkance on the fm2 layer employs an infinitesimal variation @xmath67 of its magnetization direction due to a variation @xmath68 of the angle .",
    "the fm1 magnetization direction as well as the plane of the two directions @xmath69 remain fixed , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "this leads to @xmath71 and from ( [ eq_hdef ] ) also to @xmath72 so that the size of @xmath73 coincides ( up to factor of 2 ) with angular derivative of the effective hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "the ngf formulation of the out - of - plane torkance rests on relation ( [ eq_vard ] ) applied to the operator @xmath74 , see ( [ eq_hder ] ) , with variation of the selfenergy @xmath75 due to an infinitesimal variation of the chemical potential @xmath39 given by ( [ eq_vars ] ) and similarly for @xmath75 due to the @xmath76 .",
    "this yields then response coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the out - of - plane torque with respect to chemical potentials of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 leads expressed as @xmath79 by employing a simple consequence of ( [ eq_sdo ] ) , @xmath80 , cyclic invariance of trace , angular independence of the selfenergy of nm leads , @xmath81 , and the rule @xmath82 , the response coefficients can be recast into @xmath83 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{eq_clr2}\\ ] ] which contain again only propagators at points close to the @xmath65 and @xmath66 interfaces , similarly to ( [ eq_cvgf ] , [ eq_tinvgf ] ) .",
    "the applied bias has to be identified with the difference @xmath84 and the out - of - plane torkance on fm2 is thus given by @xmath85 . since the hamiltonian ( [ eq_hdef ] ) does not contain spin - orbit interaction , the spin reference system can be chosen such that both unit vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 lie in the @xmath86 plane .",
    "this implies that @xmath50 is essentially time - inversion invariant and it can be represented by a symmetric matrix , @xmath87 ; the related quantities @xmath88 and @xmath89 are symmetric as well . as a consequence , the transmission - like terms in @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the same , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting out - of - plane torkance @xmath93 \\right\\ } \\label{eq_touvgf}\\ ] ] contains thus only reflection - like terms .      the green s function expression for the conductance ( [ eq_cvgf ] )",
    "can be translated in the language of scattering theory ; @xcite the counterparts of the torkances ( [ eq_tinvgf ] , [ eq_touvgf ] ) are interesting as well . in the present case , propagating states in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 lead will be labelled by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "moreover , a spin index @xmath96 has to be used even for nm leads , since non - collinearity of the spin valve gives rise to full spin dependence of scattering coefficients .",
    "the conductance ( [ eq_cvgf ] ) is given by the landauer formula @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the transmission coefficient from an incoming state @xmath99 into an outgoing state @xmath100 .",
    "@xcite the in - plane torkance coefficient ( [ eq_tinvgf ] ) can be written as @xmath101 whereas the out - of - plane torkance ( [ eq_touvgf ] ) can be transformed into @xmath102 where @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) denote reflection coefficients between states of the @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) lead .",
    "this result represents analogy to the landauer formula and it completes the unified theory of conductances and torkances .",
    "the developed formalism allows to study properties of spin valves with ultrathin layers , which is yet an experimentally unexplored area ; here we demonstrate its use for understanding unexpected features of _ ab initio _ results .",
    "the results discussed below were obtained using the response of spin currents on both sides of the fm2 layer , @xcite implemented within the scalar relativistic tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method @xcite similarly to our previous transport studies .",
    "@xcite as a case study , spin valves cu / co / cu / ni / cu(001 ) with face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure were chosen .",
    "all atomic positions were given by an ideal fcc co lattice with sharp interfaces between the neighboring fm and nm layers .",
    "the spin valves discussed below consist of a co layer of 5 monolayer ( ml ) thickness separated by a 10 ml thick cu spacer from a ni layer of varying thickness , embedded between two semiinfinite cu leads .",
    "self - consistent calculations within the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) were performed only for collinear spin valves ( @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) while the electronic structure of non - collinear systems was obtained by rotation of the exchange - split potentials of the co and ni fm layers .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the convergence of torkances with respect to the number of @xmath107 vectors sampling the two - dimensional brillouin zone ( bz ) of the system ; in agreement with ref .",
    "we found that reliable values of the out - of - plane torkances require finer meshes than for the in - plane torkances .",

    "figure 2a displays the calculated conductances for parallel ( @xmath105 ) , antiparallel ( @xmath106 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath109 ) orientations as well as ni - torkances in the latter case as functions of ni thickness .",
    "the most pronounced feature of the transport coefficients are oscillations with a period of about 12 ml seen in both components of the torkance .",
    "these oscillations reflect the perfect ballistic regime of electron transport across the whole spin valve .",
    "in addition , they contradict a generally accepted idea of very short magnetic coherence lengths of a few interatomic spacings , or , equivalently , of the spin - transfer torques as an interface property .",
    "@xcite very recently , spin - transfer torques in antiferromagnetic metallic femn layers have been investigated theoretically ; @xcite it has been shown that the torques are not localized to the interface but are effective over the whole femn layer . however , no oscillatory behavior of the total torkance as a function of the layer thickness has been reported .",
    "the nature of the predicted oscillations deserves thus detailed analysis , including also a discussion of their stability with respect to structural imperfections and of their absence in the conductance ( see fig .",
    "oscillations similar to those in fig .",
    "2a have recently been obtained for a different quantity of a simpler system , namely for the spin - mixing conductance @xmath110 of epitaxial fcc ( 001 ) ni thin films attached to cu leads .",
    "@xcite the real and imaginary parts of the complex @xmath110 are related to two components of the spin torque experienced by the fm film due to a spin accumulation in one of the nm leads ; @xcite the calculated values of @xmath110 for the cu / ni / cu(001 ) system are shown in fig .",
    "the oscillation periods of the torkance and the spin - mixing conductance are identical which indicates a common origin of both .",
    "the physical mechanism behind the @xmath110 oscillations was identified with an interference effect between spin-@xmath111 electrons propagating across the ni film from the @xmath26 lead to the @xmath25 lead and spin-@xmath112 electrons propagating backwards .",
    "this effect is expressed by a spin - mixing term @xmath113 in the @xmath110 , where the @xmath114 ( @xmath96 ) denote spin - resolved propagators and the trace ( tr ) does not involve the spin index .",
    "@xcite the particular value of the oscillation period follows from a special shape of the spin - polarized fermi surface of bulk fcc ni .",
    "@xcite    the oscillations of @xmath110 have been found fairly stable against cu - ni interdiffusion at the interfaces ; @xcite the same stability can be thus expected for the torkance oscillations in the spin valve .",
    "the relative stability can be understood as an effect of the large oscillation period ( @xmath115 12 ml ) : intermixing confined to a very few atomic planes at interfaces reduces the oscillation amplitude rather weakly .",
    "this feature contrasts , e.g. , sensitivity of the interlayer exchange coupling in magnetic multilayers mediated by a nm cu(001 ) spacer with oscillation periods of @xmath115 2.5 ml and 6 ml , where even a very small amount of interface disorder reduces strongly especially the amplitude of the short period oscillations",

    "another important aspect of the oscillations of the spin - transfer torques concerns their dependence on the thickness of the polarizing co layer since ultrathin layers in general might amplify ballistic and interference effects .",
    "figure 3 presents the ni - torkances in the same cu / co / cu / ni / cu(001 ) spin valves calculated for three different co thicknesses , namely 5 , 15 and 25 ml .",
    "it can be seen that the oscillations persist and have the same period in all three cases .",
    "their amplitudes depend slightly on the co thickness : the initial increase from 5 to 15 co ml is accompanied by a small reduction ( of about 20 % ) of the amplitudes whereas further increase from 15 to 25 co ml does not influence them appreciably . more detailed investigation of the effect of the thickness of the polarizing co layer , including also the limiting case of spin valves fm1/nm",
    "/ fm2/nm with a semiinfinite polarizing fm lead , @xcite is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "let us now discuss the absence of oscillations in the conductance ( fig .",
    "we introduce propagators @xmath116 of an auxiliary system nm / nm1/nm / fm2/nm , where nm1 denotes the fm1 layer with null exchange splitting .",
    "these propagators satisfy @xmath117 where the @xmath118 denotes the @xmath119-matrix corresponding to the fm1 exchange splitting @xmath120 in ( [ eq_hdef ] ) .",
    "the conductance ( [ eq_cvgf ] ) can be then rewritten as @xmath121 , where @xmath122 represents an operator localized at the fm1 layer , i.e. , at the left end of the fm2 layer .",
    "the latter trace can be most easily evaluated using the spin quantization axis parallel to the fm2 magnetization direction @xmath5 .",
    "since the propagators @xmath116 are now diagonal in the spin index @xmath123 and the operator @xmath64 is spin - independent , the conductance does not contain spin - mixing terms , i.e. , terms @xmath124 for @xmath125 that result in interference effects involving different spin channels . for the torkance , however , the extra factor @xmath126 in ( [ eq_tinvgf ] ) provides the necessary spin mixing responsible for the oscillations , in full analogy to oscillations of the spin - mixing conductance .",
    "a recent study of spin - transfer torques in a tunnel junction cu / fe / mgo / fe / cu has predicted torkance and conductance oscillations with fe thickness with a period @xmath115 2 ml .",
    "@xcite these oscillations were ascribed to quantum well states in the majority spin of the fe layer , i.e. , to interference effects in a single spin channel .",
    "the oscillations in the cu / co / cu / ni / cu system  manifested only in the torkance  have thus a clearly different origin .",
    "we have addressed two important aspects of spin - transfer torques in non - collinear spin valves with ultrathin layers .",
    "first , we have shown that the in - plane and out - of - plane torkance on one fm layer can be expressed by means of the transmission and reflection coefficients , respectively , of the whole spin valve , in close analogy to the landauer formula for the ballistic conductance .",
    "second , a novel oscillatory behavior for ni - based systems has been predicted due to the mixed spin channels .",
    "the oscillations with ni thickness are reasonably stable with respect to interface imperfections of real samples ; however , they are not present in the conductance but can be observed only in the ni - torkance .",
    "the torkance oscillations prove that the spin - transfer torques in ballistic spin valves are closely related to properties of their components , in particular to the spin - mixing conductances of individual ferromagnetic layers .",
