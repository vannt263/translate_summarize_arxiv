    "the precise determination of the properties of the higgs - like particle discovered during run - i of the lhc  @xcite is a main focus of the run - ii physics program . within the current experimental precision , the coupling strengths of this particle",
    "appear to be consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite . with both theoretical and experimental developments ,",
    "a significant improvement in the precision of the determination of the higgs couplings is expected at the lhc during the high luminosity ( hl ) phase  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the higgs couplings which enter both production and decay processes is achieved by performing a ( global ) fit to @xmath7 data of the observable final states .",
    "this is necessary since a direct measurement of the sm higgs boson width is not feasible at the lhc ( or at proposed future colliders ) since the expected value of @xmath8  mev  @xcite is orders of magnitude smaller than the mass resolution of the detectors .",
    "the importance of a precision measurement of the @xmath1 partial width can not be overstated , since this constitutes the dominant decay channel for the sm higgs boson ( @xmath9  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , a modification of the higgs coupling to @xmath10-quarks can have a sizeable impact on the extraction of all other higgs couplings as the higgs production rate and all branching fractions are modified by a shift in the total decay width @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , precision extractions of the @xmath1 partial and total width at the lhc are challenging .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath1 partial width is ultimately limited at the lhc , since knowledge of both the shape and normalisation of the contributing qcd backgrounds must be known to high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "current projections for a measurement of the @xmath1 signal strength indicate that precision @xmath12 may be achievable in the hl phase of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "an extraction of the total width from experimental data ( under minimal assumptions ) through interference effects  @xcite is possible , and additional information can also be gained by including lep data  @xcite .",
    "however , the current constraint from this technique is approximately @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "a precise model independent measurement of both these quantities requires input from a dedicated ` higgs machine ' .",
    "there are several design proposals for a collider with such capabilities , such as a linear / circular @xmath14 machine  @xcite , muon - collider  @xcite , or @xmath15 machine  @xcite .",
    "although the proposed physics programs are different in each case , the common goal is to achieve @xmath16 level precision on the measurement of higgs couplings .",
    "for example , through a combination of a higgs recoil measurement and an exclusive measurement of @xmath17 , better than 10% precision on the total width can be expected  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath1 branching fraction ,",
    "better than @xmath16 precision is expected in some cases  see table 2.3 of  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , precision calculations are also required to interpret the data . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the qcd corrections to the higgs decay to @xmath10-quarks in the framework of the standard model effective field theory ( smeft ) .    in the smeft framework",
    ", the effects of physics beyond the sm are parameterised by a set of non - vanishing wilson coefficients of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "practically , the usual dimension-4 sm lagrangian is extended to include operators of mass - dimension @xmath18 , which are constructed from gauge - invariant combinations of sm fields and multiplied by wilson coefficients of mass dimension ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these operators effectively describe the interactions of new physics particles with those present in the sm , an approach which may be justified if the energy scale of these new particles @xmath20 greatly exceeds the electroweak scale .",
    "one of the main benefits of this approach is that new physics effects can be characterised without specifying a particular uv complete model of physics beyond - the - sm ( bsm ) .",
    "the interpretation of data in terms of non - vanishing wilson coefficients is therefore performed in a model - independent fashion . in the absence of any direct evidence for new particle states during run - i of the lhc",
    ", we believe this approach to be both justified and well motivated .    during run - i",
    ", the interpretation of higgs measurements by atlas and cms was generally performed in the ` interim ' @xmath21 and signal strength formalisms  see for example the combined run - i analysis of cms and atlas data  @xcite .",
    "in run - ii , it is a recommendation of the lhc higgs cross section working group to move towards a more general eft framework ( see for instance section 10.4 of  @xcite ) .",
    "in doing so , it is important to note that the predictions for observables obtained in smeft are not unlike those obtained in the sm ( or uv - completions of the sm for that matter ) where a perturbative expansion has been applied  higher - order corrections reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the predictions of observables . moreover , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to a given observable typically depend on wilson coefficients which are not present in the tree - level result .",
    "it is therefore important to extend smeft analyses to nlo , to allow for a more precise determination of wilson coefficients ( and allowed ranges ) through a comparison with experimental data , and much recent work has been dedicated to this task for a wide range of processes  @xcite .    at present",
    ", it is possible to deduce logarithmically enhanced nlo corrections appearing in fixed - order perturbation theory to arbitrary observables using renormalisation - group ( rg ) equations for the wilson coefficients along with the full one - loop anomalous dimension matrix calculated in @xcite .",
    "however , it is common practice to use rg - improved perturbation theory to absorb such logarithmic corrections into the running of the scale - dependent wilson coefficients between @xmath22 and the scale at which the underlying decay or scattering process takes place ( for @xmath23 decays this is @xmath24 ) .",
    "this removes large logarithms involving @xmath22 from effective theory matrix elements , and allows constraints on wilson coefficients obtained at experimentally accessible energy scales to be interpreted at the scale @xmath22 where the effective interactions are generated .",
    "the remaining nlo corrections do not contain large logarithms involving the scale @xmath22 , and can not be deduced from an rg analysis . however , these corrections can still be important numerically because for the interesting region of @xmath25  tev the rg - induced logarithms are not dramatically enhanced .    in this work , we extend our previous calculation of such nlo smeft corrections arising from four - fermion contributions and the ( presumably ) numerically dominant electroweak corrections  @xcite by computing the @xmath0 correction to the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "we proceed by introducing the relevant details of the smeft framework for the @xmath1 decay , and discuss the renormalisation procedure we adopt for performing smeft nlo calculations .",
    "we then provide the analytic results , and make recommendations for their use in phenomenological studies .",
    "in the smeft , the usual sm lagrangian is appended by higher - dimensional operators multiplied by wilson coefficients . in the current work we are interested in dimension-6 operators , and",
    "so use a lagrangian of the form @xmath26 the operators relevant for this work are listed in table  [ op59 ] .",
    "note that in our convention the wilson coefficients of dimension-6 operators have mass dimension minus two , so that the @xmath27 are suppressed by @xmath28 , and that we have rescaled the operator @xmath29 by a factor of the strong coupling constant @xmath30 with respect to the usual definition .",
    "the relevant interaction lagrangian for higgs couplings to down - type quarks is    .[op59 ] a sub - set of the 59 independent dimension-6 operators built from standard model fields which conserve baryon number relevant for the current calculation , as given in ref .",

    "are higher - order in the power counting .",
    "the massless limit is therefore found to be an extremely good approximation .",
    "naively , one might suggest to neglect terms which are numerically small compared to that multiplying @xmath82 in the massive result ( which is for instance a factor of @xmath140 larger than the @xmath119 contribution ) .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , in a broad range of uv complete models it is expected that the wilson coefficient @xmath82 scales as @xmath141 . under such circumstances , the sensitivity to @xmath142 and @xmath143 is comparable ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the higgs boson couplings are inferred by performing a ( global ) fit to @xmath7 data of the observable final states .",
    "many groups have now performed dedicated analyses and/or global fits to the lhc higgs coupling data in an eft framework  @xcite . it should be noted that including constraints from precision electroweak and low - energy observables is also important in a global fit to higgs data at nlo , since operators which contribute to electroweak precision observables at tree - level can enter the expressions for nlo higgs decay rates  @xcite .",
    "an important tool used in several of these global fits is the package ` ehdecay `  @xcite which allows the computation of higgs boson decay widths and branching ratios within the smeft ( implemented in the silh basis  @xcite ) .",
    "this program is an extension of ` hdecay `  @xcite , which computes these observables within the sm . in this case , the expression for the @xmath1 eft decay rate is obtained by applying a scaling of the tree - level prediction .",
    "the scaling factor is the same as that used in the sm , and includes the massless qcd corrections up to @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "this is of course a reasonable procedure , since the qcd corrections to the @xmath2-vertex involving @xmath82 and @xmath65 factorise , and the most accurate predictions should be applied wherever possible .",
    "in addition to the scaled tree - level results , we suggest to include the @xmath0 contributions involving @xmath83 and @xmath119 which are currently not included .",
    "the relevant results are provided in eq .",
    "( [ massless ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the dominant contribution from both of these operators arise from genuine nlo effects , which can not be predicted by an rg analysis .",
    "finally , electroweak corrections are known for the @xmath1 decay rate in the sm  @xcite . however , unlike the qcd corrections involving @xmath82 and @xmath65 , these contributions do not factorise in a straightforward way , and a scaling by known sm corrections is not appropriate",
    ". a dedicated calculation of the full nlo electroweak corrections in the smeft is in progress . in the meantime , we suggest to include the results involving the one - loop four - fermion and dominant yukawa corrections which were computed in  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the running of the @xmath10-quark mass receives large logarithmic corrections involving the scalar four - fermion operators @xmath146 , and these contributions should be resummed following a similar procedure as was taken for @xmath3 in this work .",
