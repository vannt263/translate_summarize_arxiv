    ", hamiltonian lattice waves are rather complicate because they are not determined by odes  as the counterparts in spatially continuous systems  but by nonlocal advance - delay - differential equations . in the prototypical case of a one - dimensional chain with nearest neighbor interactions , which we refer to as fermi - pasta - ulam or fpu - type chain , the problem consists in finding scalar profile functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 along with a speed @xmath2 such that @xmath3 is satisfied for all @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is the derivative of the interaction potential and @xmath6 denotes the continuous phase variable , that is the spatial coordinate in the co - moving frame .",
    "the profiles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related to the atomic velocities and distances , respectively , since we have @xmath7 for any traveling wave in the fpu - type chain @xmath8 .    for the integrable examples ",
    "the linear case , the toda chain , and the hard - sphere model  the complete solution set to the nonlocal equation is known , see @xcite and the references therein . for general potentials",
    ", however , there exists nowadays a sophisticated existence theory for different types of traveling waves , see the discussion below , but only very little is known about their qualitative properties . in particular , there is no result that guarantees the uniqueness or the dynamical stability of traveling waves in a chain with arbitrary but convex interaction potential .",
    "mathematically , this lack of information is intimately related to the characteristic features of .",
    "first , the advance - delay structure prevents the exploitation of many concepts and methods that have been proven powerful in the context of low - dimensional odes and delay equations .",
    "second , the underlying lattice flow is symplectic and exhibits a richer dynamical behavior than dissipative particle systems",
    ".    since a complete understanding of the general case is currently out of reach , we are naturally interested in special potentials and asymptotic regimes that allow for almost explicit or approximate solutions of and hence to investigate the open mathematical problems in a simplified setting .",
    "the most prominent example is the near - sonic limit , in which nonlinear lattices can be modeled by the korteweg - de vries equation .",
    "the advance - delay - differential equations can hence by replaced by a planar ode , see @xcite for rigorous approximation formulas , @xcite for stability proofs , and @xcite for generalizations to granular and polyatomic chains .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for the small - amplitude limit , to @xcite for the case of near - binary interactions , and to @xcite for almost explicit traveling wave solutions in chains with piecewise linear force terms or small perturbations of such systems .",
    "another asymptotic regime is the high - energy limit for chains with singular potential in which particle interactions can be interpreted as elastic collisions , see @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown in @xcite by a rigorous twoscale expansion that traveling waves in this limit are determined by an asymptotic ode initial - value problem , which governs the behavior of the appropriately scaled distance profile .",
    "this observation provides a good starting point for further investigations because the limiting ode problem yields the explicit scaling law for the wave speed as well as global approximation formulas for both the distance and the velocity profile .    in this paper",
    "we study the high - energy limit for potentials that do not possess a singularity but grow exponentially .",
    "our overall strategy is similar to @xcite since we likewise employ local scalings in order to characterize the fine properties of the wave profiles near the critical positions and up to high accuracy .",
    "the details , however , are different because we have to impose other scaling relations and to deviate in the justification of the asymptotic estimates .",
    "moreover , the final approximation formulas are more explicit because in our case the asymptotic ode turns out to be integrable .",
    "the literature contains many results that establish the existence of periodic or solitary waves in fpu - type chains with fairly general interaction potential .",
    "we refer , for instance , to @xcite for constrained optimization , to @xcite for critical - point techniques , and to @xcite for center - manifold reduction .",
    "there is , however , no related uniqueness result although it is commonly believed that the different approaches yield  at least for convex potentials  the same family of waves .    in what follows we restrict our considerations to a periodic setting (",
    "the solitary case can be studied along the same lines ) and construct traveling waves by the constrained maximization of a potential - energy functional subject to certain constraints .",
    "more precisely , we study a _ normalized velocity profile _ @xmath9 , which is supposed to be @xmath10-periodic , along with the optimization problem @xmath11 where the parameter @xmath12 becomes small in the high - energy - limit .",
    "the potential - energy functional @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 where the operator @xmath15 can be viewed as the convolution with the indicator function of the symmetric unit interval and provides the _ normalized distance profile _ via @xmath16 .",

    "it is , however , more convenient to work with the normalized profiles @xmath22 and @xmath27 because these converge in the high - energy limit @xmath30 while @xmath31 and @xmath32 become unbounded .",
    "in this paper we fix @xmath33 and assume that the force term @xmath34 grows like @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a given parameter .",
    "a prototypical example ( with @xmath37 ) is @xmath38 but our setting also covers ( with @xmath39 ) the toda case , in which the particles interact via @xmath40 more generally , in what follows we study the following class of fpu - type chains , where some constants have been normalized to ease the presentation .    [ ass : pot ] @xmath5 can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is continuously differentiable with @xmath43 and satisfies @xmath44 and some constants @xmath45 , @xmath36 .",

    "we improve the convergence part of proposition [ prop : existence ] by adapting the twoscale approach from @xcite .",
    "the key step is to study the convergence under the _ tip scaling _ in  [ sect : tipscal ] , which describes the fine structure of @xmath27 in the vicinity of @xmath56 and reveals the aforementioned asymptotic ode initial - value problem . in our case",
    ", this problem reads @xmath57 and admits the explicit solution @xmath58 afterwards we employ in  [ sect : tranfootscal ] the _ transition scaling _ and the _ foot scaling _ in order to characterize the jump - like behavior of the velocity profile @xmath59 near @xmath60 and the turn of the distance profiles near @xmath61 , respectively . in this way",
    "we identify the scaling law for the speed parameter @xmath62 as well as refined asymptotic formulas for the normalized profiles , see  [ sect : scallaws ] and  [ sect : formulas ] , respectively .",
    "our main findings are formulated in proposition [ prop : scalingrelations ] and theorem [ thm : approximation ] , and can be summarized as follows .    in the high - energy limit , the wave profiles from proposition [ prop : existence ] can be approximated by @xmath63 and we have @xmath64 more precisely , there exist a constant @xmath65 independent of @xmath66 such that @xmath67 holds for any @xmath68 , where the norms have to be evaluated on the periodicity cell @xmath19}$ ] .",
    "a similar result holds in the case of solitary waves ( @xmath69 ) but the corresponding proof is more technical , see the related remarks to theorem  [ thm : approximation ] and in appendix [ app ] .",
    "our method can also be applied to other superpolynomially growing functions @xmath5 but the fundamental scaling relations and the proof details might be different . unfortunately , the approach does not cover the high - energy limit of polynomial interaction potentials : if @xmath5 is a polynomial of degree @xmath70 , the solution set to exhibits asymptotically the invariance @xmath71 and the limit @xmath30 is hence not governed by an ode but by the advance - delay - differential equations with @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this case , however , the arguments presented below can be adapted to derive asymptotic formulas for the limit @xmath74 .",
    "we also recall that @xcite concerns lennard - jones - type potentials with algebraic singularity of order @xmath75 , which requires to modify the fundamental scaling relations and the details in the asymptotic analysis .",
    "moreover , the corresponding asymptotic ode @xmath76 can not be integrated analytically , so the resulting approximation formulas are less explicit than , and the guaranteed error bounds are not given by but take another form and depend on @xmath77 .",
    "the asymptotic ode reveals that the dynamics of the distance @xmath78 between the particles @xmath79 and @xmath80 is for some times almost completely determined by @xmath81 itself and hence independent of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . on the conceptional level , the high - energy limit can therefore be interpreted as the asymptotic regime in which the interactions between nearest neighbors can be neglected .",
    "the similar concept of an anticontinuum limit has been studied for a huge class of many - particle systems such as the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , klein - gordan systems , and dimer chains ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , an important difference : the decoupling , which manifests in the tip scaling , describes the effective dynamics of @xmath81 only for certain times , namely those corresponding to @xmath84 , whereas the complete information on the waves can only be obtained by combining the different scalings .",
    "the foot scaling , for instance , reflects that for @xmath85 and @xmath86 the dynamics of @xmath81 is asymptotically governed by @xmath83 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "we conclude the introduction with some comments on the toda chain . for this integrable model",
    ", periodic traveling waves can be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions , see @xcite , and we readily justify that @xmath87 along with @xmath88 provide for any @xmath89 an exact solitary wave with unimodal and exponentially decaying wave profiles . we thus infer from that the non - normalized profile functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 from have for small @xmath12 basically the same shape as the solitary toda wave with @xmath90 , but the wave speed and the wave amplitudes scale differently since depends on @xmath91 , the leading algebraic order of the perturbation term @xmath92 .",
    "we also emphasize that for @xmath93 the error terms @xmath94 and @xmath95 are _ not _ , as one might guess , exponentially small in @xmath66 but as large as the related bounds in .",
    "this seems to be surprising but just means that the formulas in are not optimal for the toda chain .",
    "in fact , our approach applied to also provides high - energy approximations with exponential accuracy , see the discussion at the end of  [ sect : formulas ] , but such formulas can directly be derived by asymptotic analysis of jacobi s elliptic functions . for a nontrivial perturbation term @xmath92 ,",
    "however , there are no explicit solution formulas and numerical results indicate that the estimates in are optimal , see figure [ fig : apperrors ] .",
    "the starting point for our considerations is the second - order advance - delay - differential equation @xmath96 which can be derived from by eliminating the velocity profile @xmath22 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the scalar quantities @xmath97 which appear naturally in many of the asymptotic formulas and estimates identified below . from",
    "we immediately infer that the amplitude parameter @xmath98 satisfies @xmath99 but at this moment we do not know how @xmath100 depends on @xmath66 .",
    "below , however , we see that @xmath100 is an intrinsic length which determines the width of the transition layers in the velocity profile @xmath22 near @xmath60 as well as the fine properties of the distance profile @xmath27 near @xmath56 and @xmath61 .",
    "these observations finally imply @xmath101 and enable us to identify the scaling law for @xmath62 , see proposition [ prop : scalingrelations ] .    throughout the paper ,",
