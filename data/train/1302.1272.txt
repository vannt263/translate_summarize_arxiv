    "inflation so far seems to be the most successful proposition which can solve the shortcomings of standard big bang model and also can explain the temperature an - isotropies observed in cmbr .",
    "it is a process of extreme accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "there are two dynamical realizations of cosmological inflation , the standard scenario @xcite , referred as cold inflation and warm inflation @xcite .",
    "according to the standard inflationary model the nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion that was driven by a negative - pressure vacuum energy density .",
    "the high vacuum energy density drove this accelerated expansion during the very early moments of the big bang .",
    "this expansion is responsible for the continuing hubble expansion of the universe , its present size , its relative homogeneity and isotropy , and its spatial flatness .",
    "inflation also explains the origin of the large - scale structure of the cosmos .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field produced ripples in space - time , which are thought to be the primordial seeds of the galaxy formation.these models assume that any radiation present in the universe prior to the inflationary period rapidly dilutes out and there is no further radiation production during inflationary era .",
    "in warm inflation , the energy stored in vacuum is converted into radiation due to dissipation effects during period of inflation which never leaves the universe cold in contrast to the standard cold scenario where at the end of inflationary period the universe is left at supercooled state and a mechanism of reheating is required for generation of relativistic particles which reheats the universe .",
    "the basic idea of warm inflation is that during inflationary period the inflaton field is coupled to several other fields but no a priory assumption is made regarding the multi - field interaction.that makes it explicit that the thermodynamic state of the universe during inflation is a dynamical question @xcite .",
    "as the inflaton relaxes towards its minimum energy configuration , it is assumed that it decays into lighter fields , generating an effective viscosity .",
    "if this viscosity is large enough , the inflaton will reach a slow - roll regime , where its dynamics becomes over-damped.this over damping is efficient to get the correct number of e - folds before the end of inflation @xcite.the inclusion of thermal effects acts similar to a mass term which breaks the scale - symmetry of the zero - temperature theory @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite it has been argued that the coupling constant fine - tuning problem is closely associated to this scale symmetry and breaking this scale symmetry can avoid this problem.hence warm - inflation can be considered as a successful mechanism of inflation sans independent reheating period .",
    "one of the theoretical issues with the paradigm of inflation is that in most of the models , instead of being motivated from a fundamental theory , the scalar field responsible for driving inflation is chosen ad - hoc .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to device a consistent mechanism for reheating in each model specifically when the potentials are of runaway type .",
    "the mechanism of reheating is very crucial particularly the particle production and energy transfer issues.in the last decade there are many attempts to construct successful models of inflation driven by scalar fields motivated from string theory .",
    "but the cold - inflationary models , though could account for the cosmological observables @xcite lacks a successful reheating mechanism at the end of inflationary mechanism in many cases .    in the string theory context ,",
    "one of the attractive inflationary model that has drawn consideattention in last few years , is where the tachyon fields associated with an unstable d - brane @xciteplays the role of the inflaton .",
    "if the tachyon field start to roll down the potential , then the universe dominated by a new form of matter will smoothly evolve from inflationary universe to an era which is dominated by a non - relativistic fluid @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the tachyon field is described by a non standard effective action @xcite    surprisingly the motion of a d3-brane in the background of a stack of coincident ns @xmath1-branes(geometric tachyon ) is also found to be described by a similar action @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the particle experiences a proper acceleration orthogonal to its proper velocity due to the background dilaton field which changes the dynamics from that of a simple geodesic motion . in particular , it is shown that in the vicinity of the five - branes",
    ", it is this acceleration which is responsible for modifying the motion of the radial mode to that of an inverted simple harmonic oscillator leading to the tachyonic instability@xcite .",
    "this geometric tachyon field has been studied as a candidate for driving inflation successfully @xcite .",
    "it was observed that though this tachyonic field is capable of driving cold inflation successfully , one needs a large number of ( @xmath2 ) branes to provide the necessary background .",
    "this number being a little high we wish to revisit the scenario in presence of radiation to see whether in addition to waiving out the issue of reheating if it can bring upon change in the requirements of number of ns @xmath1-branes in the background .",
    "in section.ii we discuss the formalism and in section.iii the observed result .",
    "in the cold inflationary scenario , the inflation dynamics is governed by the einstein equations for frw metric and the tachyon field equation derived from the tachyonic action ( see @xcite for details)i.e @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hubble parameter , @xmath5 is the field energy density and @xmath6 is the radiation energy density .",
    "however , in the warm inflationary scenario , i.e when thermal effects are taken into account , the corresponding equations are modified due to the contribution of radiation energy density and the inflation dynamics is described in general by the following equations @xcitewhere the dissipative effect is taken into account by introducing a term proportional to tachyon velocity .",
    "the friedmann equation and the equation of motion for tachyon field now takes the form : @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dissipation coefficient and this coefficient is is assumed to be responsible for the decay of tachyon field into radiation in the inflationary regime .",
    "so in general it is expected to be a positive function of the tachyon field .",
    "it may be worth mentioning here that attempts have been made to obtain scalar field evolution equations for warm inflation from first principles which found that dissipative effects during warm inflation are temporarily non - local although limits have also been obtained for which the effects are of the local form @xcite.in the present model , we consider the dissipation coefficient as an arbitrary function of tachyon field .",
    "the energy density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 for the tachyon field are given as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the potential function associated with the tachyon field .",
    "equation ( 1 ) then takes the form : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents partial derivative of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19    in the inflationary epoch , it is assumed that @xmath20 and @xmath21 . since in the slow - roll regime @xmath22 and @xmath23 and defining the dissipation rate @xmath24 as @xmath25 the friedmann equation and",
    "the slow - roll equation of motion for the tachyon field respectively takes the form : @xmath26    for a quasi - stable radiation process during inflationary epoch , we need @xmath27 and @xmath28 . hence in the slow roll regime , we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radiation temperature and @xmath31 is the stephan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the radion field in case of one dimensional motion of a dp - brane inside a ring of ns @xmath1-branes is tachyonic @xcite which is the geometric tachyon .",
