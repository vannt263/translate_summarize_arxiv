    "a promising way to explain the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe is to assume that at large scales general relativity ( gr ) breaks down , and a more general action describes the gravitational field .",
    "thus , in the latter context , infra - red modifications to gr have been extensively explored , where the consistency of various candidate models have been analysed ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "note that the einstein field equation of gr was first derived from an action principle by hilbert , by adopting a linear function of the scalar curvature , @xmath0 , in the gravitational lagrangian density .",
    "the physical motivations for these modifications of gravity were related to the possibility of a more realistic representation of the gravitational fields near curvature singularities and to create some first order approximation for the quantum theory of gravitational fields , and more recently in an attempt to explain the late - time cosmic acceleration . in this context , a more general modification of the hilbert - einstein gravitational lagrangian density involving an arbitrary function of the scalar invariant , @xmath1 , has been extensively explored in the literature , and recently a maximal extension of the hilbert - einstein action has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the action of the maximal extension of the hilbert - einstein action is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath0 , and of the lagrangian density corresponding to matter , @xmath5 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of matter is defined as @xmath6 .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath7 , the gravitational field equation of @xmath8 gravity is provided by @xmath9 g_{\\mu \\nu } = \\frac{1}{2 } f_{l_{m}}\\left ( r , l_{m}\\right ) t_{\\mu \\nu } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the hilbert - einstein lagrangian , @xmath10 , we recover the einstein field equations of gr , i.e. , @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are arbitrary functions of the ricci scalar and of the matter lagrangian density , respectively , we obtain the field equations of modified gravity with an arbitrary curvature - matter coupling @xcite .",
    "an interesting application was explored in the context of @xmath16 gravity@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 models possess extremely interesting properties .",
    "first , the covariant divergence of the energy - momentum tensor is non - zero , and is given by @xmath17 \\frac{\\partial l_{m}}{% \\partial g^{\\mu \\nu } } \\ , .",
    "\\label{noncons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the requirement of the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of matter , @xmath18 , provides the condition given by @xmath19 \\partial l_{m}/ \\partial g^{\\mu \\nu } = 0 $ ] .",
    "secondly , the motion of test particles is non - geodesic , and takes place in the presence of an extra force . as a specific example , consider the case in which matter , assumed to be a perfect thermodynamic fluid , obeys a barotropic equation of state , with the thermodynamic pressure @xmath20 being a function of the rest mass density of the matter @xmath21 only , i.e. , @xmath22 , and consequently , the matter lagrangian density , becomes an arbitrary function of the energy density @xmath21 only , i.e. , @xmath23 ( for more details , we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the equation of motion of a test fluid is given by @xmath24 , where the extra - force @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 \\left ( u^{\\mu } u^{\\nu } -g^{\\mu \\nu } \\right ) \\,.\\ ] ] note that @xmath25 is perpendicular to the four - velocity , @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the non - geodesic motion , due to the non - minimal couplings present in the model , implies the violation of the equivalence principle , which is highly constrained by solar system experimental tests .",
    "however , it has recently been argued , from data of the abell cluster a586 , that the interaction between dark matter and dark energy implies the violation of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to test these models with non - minimal couplings in the context of the violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the violation of the equivalence principle is also found as a low - energy feature of some compactified versions of higher - dimensional theories .    in the newtonian limit of weak gravitational fields @xcite , the equation of motion of a test fluid in @xmath4 gravity",
    "is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total acceleration of the system ; @xmath31 is the newtonian gravitational acceleration ; the term @xmath32 $ ] is identified with the hydrodynamic acceleration term in the perfect fluid euler equation .",
    "now , by assuming that in the newtonian limit the function @xmath33 can be represented as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 given by @xmath37\\,,\\ ] ] is a supplementary acceleration induced due to the modification of the action of the gravitational field .",
    "in conclusion , the maximal extensions of gr , namely the @xmath2 gravity models open the possibility of going beyond the algebraic structure of the hilbert - einstein action . on the other hand ,",
    "the field equations of @xmath2 gravity are equivalent to the field equations of the @xmath1 model in empty space - time , but differ from them , as well as from gr , in the presence of matter .",
    "thus , the predictions of @xmath2 gravitational models could lead to some major differences , as compared to the predictions of standard gr , or other generalized gravity models , in several problems of current interest , such as cosmology , gravitational collapse or the generation of gravitational waves .",
    "the study of these phenomena may also provide some specific signatures and effects , which could distinguish and discriminate between the various gravitational models .",
    "in addition to this , in order to explore in more detail the connections between the @xmath2 theory and the cosmological evolution , it is necessary to build some explicit physical models .",
