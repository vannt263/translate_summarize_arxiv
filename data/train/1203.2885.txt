    "evidence is now compelling that most externally - polluted white dwarfs derive their heavy elements by accretion from tidally - disrupted planetesimals @xcite . here , we report new ultraviolet spectroscopy of two polluted white dwarfs to exploit this uniquely powerful tool to determine the bulk composition of extrasolar asteroids  the building blocks of rocky planets .",
    "the composition of extrasolar planets is of great interest and considerable effort has been devoted to studying main - sequence stars with the goal of identifying spectroscopic signatures of accretion of planets @xcite . however , because a star s own heavy elements dominate the composition of its photosphere , it is very difficult to determine a planetary contribution to the measured abundances .",
    "in contrast , as reviewed by @xcite , white dwarfs with effective temperatures less than 25,000 k typically have atmospheres that are nearly pure hydrogen or pure helium and the observed heavy elements usually are the result of external pollution . with the discovery of 17 individual elements within the photosphere of the white dwarf gd 362 ,",
    "it has become clear that we can use these externally - polluted stars to make detailed comparisons of the bulk compositions of extrasolar planetesimals with those of the solar system s terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "about 94% of bulk earth s total mass is contained within four dominant elements : o , mg , si and fe @xcite .",
    "ground - based optical spectra with some additional results from _ fuse _ , the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ , indicate that these same four species comprise at least 85% of the heavy element mass in six highly polluted white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , these optical studies incompletely sample important species which only have strong lines in the ultraviolet .",
    "we have therefore acquired spectra with the _ hubble space telescope _ to measure the abundances of additional elements in gd 40 and g241 - 6 , two of the three most heavily polluted db white dwarfs within 80 pc of the sun @xcite .",
    "our ultraviolet data are a substantial improvement over older , lower - resolution data for gd 40 @xcite ; no previous ultraviolet spectroscopy has been performed on g241 - 6 .",
    "gd 40 shows excess infrared continuum emission from a circumstellar dust disk @xcite that also displays 10 @xmath0 silicate emission @xcite .",
    "while g241 - 6 and gd 40 have nearly the same effective temperatures , gravities and abundances of heavy - element pollutants @xcite , g241 - 6 does not display an infrared excess @xcite .",
    "either g241 - 6 s disk is fully gaseous or the parent body has been largely accreted and we are witnessing lingering contamination in the stellar photosphere ; heavy elements take longer than 2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 yr to sink below the outer mixing zone @xcite .    in the standard picture @xcite , planet - forming disks",
    "have well defined radial temperature zones and rocky planets assemble from material in a relatively narrow annulus .",
    "therefore a single condensation temperature can usefully describe the bulk abundances .",
    "this picture has been adopted in models for the formation of extrasolar rocky planets @xcite ; extrasolar planetesimals are expected to be volatile - poor if they form sufficiently close to their host star .    in the solar system , an element s condensation temperature is key in determining its incorporation into a planetesimal .",
    "typically , for the pressure , temperature and presumed composition of the solar nebula , the molecular constituents are computed and the fractional condensation is determined for each compound . for bulk earth ,",
    "refractory elements that are incorporated into solids at temperatures above 1100 k are undepleted relative to solar abundances while volatile elements with a condensation temperature less than 1000 k are deficient by factors of as much as 100 or more compared to a solar composition @xcite .",
    "the most primitive meteorites , the ci chondrites , only display depletions relative to solar values of elements with condensation temperatures below 200 k , while the more evolved cv chondrites have depletions by at least a factor of two of elements with a condensation temperature below @xmath3700 k @xcite .",
    "previous support for volatile - depletion within extrasolar planetesimals is given by the evidence that carbon is usually deficient @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that , in aggregate , planetesimals accreted onto db white dwarfs have a factor of 10 less h@xmath4o by mass than do ci chondrites , consistent with a scenario where these particular extrasolar rocky bodies were assembled interior to a snow line which , depending upon the gas pressure , is located where the temperature is between 145 k and 170 k @xcite . by measuring volatile compositions of individual extrasolar asteroids , we can more exactly assess the degree to which they are thermally processed .",
    "the most important volatile elements that might be detected in polluted white dwarf spectra are c , n , and s with 50% condensation temperatures of 40 k , 123 k , and 664 k , respectively @xcite because they are expected to be largely contained within ch@xmath5 , nh@xmath6 and fes .",
    "another abundant volatile is oxygen , but this element is special because much of it is incorporated into oxides of refractory elements such as si and mg . typically , there is  leftover \" oxygen which does not condense into solids until the system attains a much lower temperature at which point h@xmath4o ice forms .    in section 2 , we report our data acquisition and reduction . in section 3 ,",
    "we report atmospheric abundances while in section 4 we infer compositions of the accreted parent bodies . in section 5 , we discuss our results in the context of models for the growth of planetesimals and in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "for both gd 40 and g241 - 6 , we obtained spectra with the g130 m grating of the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) during cycle 18 of the _ hubble space telescope _ under go program 12290 .",
    "observations were obtained in the time - tag mode using the 25 diameter primary science aperture ( psa ) with a central wavelength of 1300  .",
    "data were acquired during 3 spacecraft orbits for each star with a total integration time of 7,740 s for gd 40 and 8,835 s for g241 - 6 . in each orbit , the fp - pos value was set to a different value to minimize the fixed pattern noise in the detector .",
    "the spectra extend from 1140  to 1440  except for a slight gap of @xmath7 12  near 1300  ; the spectral resolution was @xmath7 20,000 .",
    "the raw cos data were processed with calcos pipeline 2.15.4 and then smoothed with a boxcar of five pixels . at most wavelengths ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for each star is @xmath8 25 .",
    "the final spectra presented here are flux calibrated and in vacuum wavelengths . because of strong terrestrial day airglow emission from o i between 1300  and 1308  and from h i near lyman @xmath9 @xcite , we use the _ timefilter _ module to extract the night time portion of the data and rerun calcos to obtain the calibrated spectra for these two spectral intervals .",
    "the airglow emission is completely removed at the oxygen lines ; however , residual emission remains at lyman @xmath9 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "near the edge of the spectrum at 1300  , the pipeline reduction becomes somewhat noisy and unreliable ( private communication , cos help desk ) .",
    "the cos - measured flux of both stars near 1400  is 1.4 @xmath1 10@xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 @xmath12 , the same as measured with the galex satellite in a broad band centered at 1528  .",
    "similar to the data reduction procedures described in @xcite and @xcite , with iraf , each absorption line was fit with a voigt profile and the equivalent width ( ew ) was derived . for each line",
    ", we performed three different measurements and the final ew uncertainty was obtained by adding three factors in quadrature : the standard deviation of the three fits , the average uncertainty of an individual fit to the assumed profile and the uncertainty of the continuum .",
    "for marginally blended lines , we used  splot \" in iraf to perform deblending and measure the individual ew .",
    "we list in table 1 the lines with values of the ew greater than 50 m in at least one of our two target stars .    for elements without positive detections ,",
    "we place upper limits to the ew by measuring the signal - to - noise ratio at the region of its expected strongest line .",
    "we calculate the 1 @xmath13 uncertainty by dividing the full width zero intensity by the signal - to - noise ratio . we quote 3@xmath14 values for the upper limits to the ews . in the best - case",
    ", this procedure translates to an ew of 24 m , but , for some lines , the upper limit to the ew is 30 m or even 35 m .",
    "we validated this procedure by inserting artificial lines into the data .",
    "as expected from ground - based optical spectra , the ultraviolet spectra of gd 40 and g241 - 6 each exhibit hundreds of photospheric absorption lines , many more than can be found in the older ultraviolet data of gd 40 which had only 1  resolution @xcite and a lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the ew s of almost all the photospheric lines are less than 200 m and therefore would have been difficult to detect in the older data .",
    "the average heliocentric velocity of the photospheric lines from the cos spectra is 19 km s@xmath12 and -23 km s@xmath12 for gd 40 and g241 - 6 , respectively . as with the optical data ,",
    "the dispersion is near 5 km s@xmath12 for each star @xcite .",
    "these values are different from the optically - measured values ; @xcite and @xcite reported the velocities of 10 km / s and -28 km / s for gd 40 and g241 - 6 , respectively .",
    "the difference between the optical and ultraviolet results can be attributed to the well - known difficulty of measuring absolute velocities with cos to better than 15 km s@xmath12 ( cos instrument handbook ) . in figures 1 - 10 , some of the observed spectra are additionally shifted beyond the nominal correction for the heliocentric velocity by as much as @xmath15 4 km s@xmath12 to match more exactly the model spectra .",
    "our abundance determinations from the ultraviolet data follow closely the procedures described previously for our optical observations @xcite . unless otherwise specified , we use atomic data taken from either vald or nist and the model atmosphere parameters listed in table 2 . for gd 40 , @xcite",
    "derive an effective temperature of 14,780 k and @xmath16 @xmath17 = 8.13 ( cgs units ) .",
    "following the arguments in @xcite we adopt a temperature of 15,300 k which , however , may be in error by @xmath3 500 k. regardless , as shown in @xcite , variations of the effective temperature of 500 k and @xmath16 @xmath17 of 0.3 typically lead to changes in the abundances of heavy elements relative to each other by less than 0.1 dex although the abundances relative to he , the dominant gas in the photosphere , can vary by as much as 0.4 dex .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties in our adopted effective temperature and gravity do not lead to any qualitative change in our results . for g241 - 6",
    ", our value of the effective temperature of 15,300 k is nearly equal to the 15,230 k temperature independently derived by @xcite .",
    "for this same star , our value of the gravity of @xmath16 @xmath17 = 8.0 is slightly smaller than the value of @xmath16 @xmath17 of @xcite .",
    "to derive abundances , we compare cos data with a model atmosphere to find the best fit to each line profile and ew .",
    "for all detailed comparisons displayed below , we convolve the model predictions with the cos line spread function @xcite . from the measured ew of each individual line ,",
    "we compute an abundance estimate .",
    "for each element , we then average , weighted by the quality of the data and atomic parameters , over each individual value to derive the ultraviolet - determined abundance that best fits all of an element s spectral lines .",
    "the error determinations arise from scatter in the measurement of the equivalent widths and uncertainties in the models and atomic parameters .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the abundance uncertainties propagated from ew determination are much less than the standard deviation of the abundance determined from different lines . as a result , the final abundance uncertainty for each element is derived from the internal dispersion of all its lines . because of modeling uncertainties , we assume a minimum error of 0.10 dex in all of our  final \" abundances  including those with only optical determinations",
    ".    our final abundance for each element is determined by combining our previous optical studies @xcite with our current cos analysis ; these results are provided in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "below , we discuss each element in detail .",
    "representative data are shown in figures 1 - 10 where we also display the predictions from models employing the final set of abundances .",
    "ultraviolet spectra of nearby stars display many interstellar absorption lines from species in the ground electronic state @xcite . using _",
    "fuse _ to perform a survey of white dwarfs within 200 pc of the sun , @xcite found , as expected , that interstellar absorption lines are pervasive .",
    "therefore , although both gd 40 and g241 - 6 lie within the local interstellar bubble where the density is relatively low , their ultraviolet spectra must possess interstellar absorption lines .",
    "extensive optical surveys of the local interstellar gas show that it is patchy @xcite , and we can not predict its amount .",
    "we therefore estimate the importance of interstellar lines by considering a likely range of absorption line strengths . a convenient tabulation of the equivalents widths of interstellar absorption lines has been presented for @xmath9 vir @xcite , a star whose distance of 77 pc suggests that it should experience roughly comparable amounts of interstellar absorption as gd 40 and g241 - 6 .",
    "the interstellar lines in our target white dwarfs almost certainly are weaker than those measured in @xmath18 oph @xcite , a star with famously strong interstellar lines whose distance of 112 pc puts it outside the local bubble . in table 1 , in addition to listing the strengths of the photospheric lines of gd 40 and g241 - 6 from cos data , we list the measurements from the _ copernicus _ satellite of ews in the spectra of @xmath9 vir and @xmath18 oph whose narrow lines must be interstellar because the stars are rapidly rotating .    another way to independently determine whether a line is interstellar or photospheric is to measure its radial velocity , since these two types of lines usually have different velocities .",
    "unfortunately , for gd 40 these two velocities are almost the same so this method fails to discern interstellar lines .",
    "the radial velocity offset between interstellar and photospheric lines for g241 - 6 is about 20 km s@xmath12 and can be used to identify interstellar features .",
    "the offsets for c and n are provided in the captions to figures 2 and 3 .",
    "even though as shown in figure 1 there is substantial residual airglow emission , we have used the cos  night - time \" observations to derive upper bounds to the column density of atomic hydrogen , n(h ) , from the lyman @xmath9 line , h i 1216  .",
    "unfortuantely , we can not easily determine how much of the line is interstellar and how much is photospheric .",
    "for gd 40 , the star with the stronger lyman @xmath9 line , if the hydrogen is entirely photospheric , then in the usual notation where [ x]/he ] denotes @xmath16 @xmath19(x)/@xmath19(he ) , we derive [ h]/[he ] = -5.1 , approximately a factor of 10 greater than found from h@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if [ h]/[he ] = - 6.14 as determined from the optical data , then following @xcite , we find n(h ) = 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath20 @xmath11 , approximately a factor of 10 greater than values of n(h ) for stars 70 pc from the sun @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the lyman @xmath9 line is primarily photospheric .",
    "it is possible that the broad , weak h@xmath9 line was not well measured in the keck hires echelle spectrum which is difficult to flatten @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite also report a very weak h@xmath9 absorption line and derived [ h]/[he ] = -6.02 .",
    "@xcite report [ h]/[he ] = -6.1 , but with an uncertainty of 1.0 dex because the line is weak and difficult to measure .",
    "our final estimate of the abundance reported in table 3 has a large uncertainty .",
    "we hope to reconcile the discrepancy between the optical and ultraviolet results for photospheric hydrogen in gd 40 in future studies ; for now it is mystery .",
    "fortunately this factor of 10 uncertainty in the hydrogen abundance does not materially affect the overall structure of the model atmosphere , so the abundance determinations for other elements are unaffected .    for g241 - 6 , from the lack of h@xmath9 absorption , @xcite report [ h]/[he ]",
    "@xmath21 -6.1 while @xcite report an upper limit to [ h]/[he ] of -5.43 .",
    "if the lyman @xmath9 line is entirely photospheric in origin , then [ h]/[he ] = -5.6 , in disagreement with the upper limit from @xcite . if , however , [ h]/[he ] = -6.1 in the photosphere , then , as illustrated in figure 1 , n(h ) = 3 @xmath1 10@xmath22 @xmath11 .",
    "given that interstellar nitrogen lines detected toward this star are stronger than those measured for @xmath9 vir , it is plausible that the interstellar hydrogen column density could approach this value of 3 @xmath1 10@xmath22 @xmath11 .",
    "if so , then there is no disagreement between the measurement of [ h]/[he ] derived from the ultraviolet and the upper bound derived from the optical .",
    "the ultraviolet lines of c i and c ii that are accessible in our cos data are subject to interstellar contamination because they arise either from the ground state or a very low - lying energy level .",
    "in figure 2 , we display the comparison between our data and models for gd 40 and g241 - 6 for the spectral interval 1327  to 1338  . in both stars , we see c ii absorption at 1334.53  and 1335.71  . however , neither interstellar nor photospheric absorption from c i is detected .    in table 1 , the c ii lines toward gd 40 are somewhat stronger than even in @xmath18 oph .",
    "furthermore , the line at 1335.71  arises from an excited fine structure level ( see column 2 in table 1 ) which is fully populated according to its statistical weight in a stellar photosphere but not so in the interstellar medium where the density is vastly lower .",
    "consequently , an interstellar line at 1335.71  is almost always weaker than the line at 1334.53  . in view of this consideration ,",
    "it is likely that the c ii lines toward gd 40 are largely photospheric with an abundance of [ c]/[he ] = -7.8 . our upper bounds to the ci lines near 1277  and 1328  are consistent with this result .",
    "for g241 - 6 , it appears that the cii line at 1334.53  is largely interstellar because it is offset from the photospheric velocity and because it is substantially stronger than the cii 1335.71  line .",
    "if c ii 1335.71  is entirely photospheric , then [ c]/[he ] = -8.5 . because the line is likely at least partly interstellar ,",
    "we conclude that this value of the abundance is only an upper limit . our upper bounds to the ci lines near 1277  and 1328  are consistent with this result .",
    "the accessible photospheric lines of n i at 1199.55  , 1200.22  and 1200.71  all arise from the ground state and are strong in the interstellar medium .",
    "a further difficulty is that these lines can be blended with photospheric fe ii 1199.67 ,1200.24  and 1200.75  .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the fe lines dominate this spectral region , and there is no evidence for any nitrogen lines in the spectrum of gd 40 ; we derive [ n]/[he ] @xmath21 -8.8 . for g241 - 6 ,",
    "the observed lines probably arise from interstellar absorption because their wavelengths are offset and from what is expected in the stellar rest frame and , instead , agree with the offset of the likely interstellar line at c ii 1334.53  .",
    "there is no evidence for photospheric nitrogen ; we derive an upper limit of [ n]/[he ] @xmath21 -8.9 .",
    "we detect o i 1152.15  and 1217.65  in both stars ; the data are shown in figures 4 and 1 .",
    "these lines must be photospheric because they arises from excited electronic states . using night - time data only to avoid day glow emission ,",
    "we also detect o i 1302.17  , 1304.86  and 1306.03  ; these lines are shown in figure 5 . because the o i 1302.17  line lies near the edge of the array , the data are especially noisy and uncertain in its blue wing ( private communication , cos help desk ) .",
    "the two longer wavelength o i lines are blended with lines of si ii .",
    "because of these problems , we do not employ any of the three lines near 1302  in our abundance determination      the only line that we have used for the abundance determination for this element is al ii 1191.80  which can not be interstellar because it arises from an excited energy level .",
    "the fits to the data are shown in figure 6 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , we have apparently detected al ii 1211.90  in gd 40 , but this line is blended with a feature from fe ii , we do not attempt to use these data to infer the aluminum abundance .      we have detected numerous ultraviolet lines of si ii and one line of si iii in both gd 40 and g241 - 6 ; results are shown in figures 5 - 8 . for gd 40 , the si ii data can not be consistently fit .",
    "the model with our final abundance still under - predicts the strengths of the lines near 1260  and 1350  , but as reported in @xcite would over - predict the optical ews .",
    "the lines near 1194  are well fit with the compromise  final \" value of [ si]/[he ] given in table 3 which is larger than previously reported by @xcite by 0.32 dex . in contrast , we find a more self - consistent fit of all the si lines for g241 - 6 with only a 0.16 dex increase in [ si]/[he ] . independently , in gd 61 , a comparably externally - polluted db white dwarf , the optical and ultraviolet determinations agree to within 0.15 dex @xcite . @xcite",
    "have re - examined the oscillator strengths of si ii , and while their values for the ultraviolet lines are close to those employed in this paper , their recommended values for the optical lines are about 0.3 dex weaker than we previously used and thus accounting for much of the discrepancy between the optical and ultraviolet abundance determinations for gd 40 .",
    "the abundance difference between si and mg discussed in detail by @xcite for gd 40 is still present with our current analysis but is significantly less pronounced than previously reported .",
    "unequivocal detections of three p ii lines for both stars are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the stellar abundance determinations in tables 3 and 4 are secure .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , we have certainly detected the s ii doublet of 1204.27  and 1204.32  for g241 - 6 and perhaps for gd 40 .",
    "these lines must be photospheric . for g241 - 6",
    ", we also detected the lines at 1253.81  and 1259.52  ( figure 8) ; for gd 40 , detections of the these two lines is marginal .",
    "we also have detected s i 1433.28 toward g241 - 6 which is unlikely to be interstellar .",
    "the photospheric abundance determination of sulfur in g241 - 6 is secure ; it is tentative in gd 40 .",
    "as shown in figure 9 , we only report upper limits to cl i 1347.24  .",
    "we detected lines of mg , ca , ti , cr , mn and fe in the cos spectra .",

    "we display detections of photospheric ni in figures 2 and 4 .",
    "the potentially interstellar ni lines reported in table 1 are so much stronger than observed in @xmath18 oph that we assume that they originate in the photosphere and as - such , they are included in our abundance determination .",
    "we display the spectra near the cu ii 1358.77  line in figure 10 .",
    "the line appears at the 3@xmath14 level in the spectrum of gd 40 , and is at most marginally detected ; we can only place an upper bound to the line in g241 - 6 .",
    "we have searched for lines at 1404.12  and 1237.07  for ge and ga , respectively .",
    "they are undetected and not displayed here ; the upper limits to the abundances are reported in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "having determined the atmospheric abundances , we now proceed to estimate the composition of the accreted parent bodies .",
    "because different elements gravitationally settle through the white dwarf s outer mixing zone at different rates , the relative abundances in the photosphere may not be the same as the relative abundances in the asteroidal parent body .",
    "@xcite described three phases of an accretion event .",
    "the first phase is a build - up of pollution after the initial creation of a circumstellar disk derived from the tidal - disruption of an asteroid . during this phase , which has a duration of approximately one settling time , the photospheric abundances are the same as those in the parent body . for both gd 40 and g241 - 6",
    ", this phase has a duration of 2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 yr . during the second phase",
    ", there is an approximate steady state where the rate of accretion from the disk is balanced by the loss at the bottom of the outer mixing zone . during this phase the concentration of each individual element in the photosphere",
    "is determined by a balance between its accretion rate and its settling time ; derivation of parent body abundances must take this effect into account .",
    "the duration of this phase depends upon the mass of the parent body .",
    "the estimated steady state accretion rates for gd 40 and g241 - 6 are 2 @xmath1 10@xmath23 and 3 @xmath1 10@xmath23 g s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "ceres , the most massive asteroid in the solar system , has a mass of 9.1 @xmath1 10@xmath24 g @xcite , and it is therefore imaginable that this phase could have a duration of as much as 10@xmath25 yr , but this is extremely uncertain . as listed in table 5 , the inferred minimum mass of the asteroid accreted onto gd 40 of 3.8 @xmath1 10@xmath26 g , slightly revised from the value of 3.6 @xmath1 10@xmath26 g in @xcite , is much less than the mass of ceres . if the accretion from the disk varies with time @xcite , it may be better described to be in a quasi - steady state instead of an exact steady state . in this case",
    ", the estimated mass fractions may be uncertain by as much as a factor of two @xcite .",
    "after the disk is fully accreted , there is a final decay phase where the light elements should dominate the photospheric composition since the heavy elements sink more quickly .",
    "the duration of this final phase is on the order of a few settling times , or , for gd 40 and g241 - 6 , @xmath3 5 @xmath1 10@xmath2 yr .    because we are largely focused upon the upper limit to the abundances of the volatile elements and because carbon and nitrogen have particularly long settling times , it is most conservative to assume that the systems are in the  build - up \" phase because this is when we would infer the highest fractional abundances for the volatiles . if , instead , the system is in a steady state or declining phase , we overestimate the fraction of mass carried in the lighter elements and underestimate the fraction of mass carried in the heavier elements . according to @xcite ,",
    "the difference between derived mass fractions between the build - up phase and the steady state phase is at most a factor of 1.6 , not enough to qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "if a system is in the declining phase , then the correction to the derived mass fraction of a heavy element such as ni for gravitational settling can , in principle , be larger than a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "we display in figures 11 - 13 the relative abundances listed in table 5 . because we have a comprehensive suite of abundances in the atmospheres of gd 40 and g241 - 6 , we follow standard analysis of solar system objects and display the fraction of the total mass of the parent body carried by each element .",
    "we see in figure 11 that the two elements with 50% condensation temperatures less than 150 k , well inside the snow line @xcite , are significantly depleted in the parent bodies accreted onto gd 40 and g241 - 6 relative to the  adjusted sun \" and ci chondrites .",
    "in contrast , we see in figures 12 - 13 that the elements with condensation temperatures greater than 1000 k have mass fractions roughly similar to bulk earth and ci and cv chondrites .",
    "sulfur with an intermediate 50% condensation temperature of 664 k is heavily depleted in gd 40 but undepleted in g241 - 6 .",
    "in the usual models for their formation in a disk orbiting a central star , rocky planets grow within a radial annulus . the temperature within this annulus controls the material which is incorporated into solids and therefore ,",
    "ultimately , the chemical composition of a planet @xcite . in this picture , there is a snow line , and planets formed interior to this demarcation have little ice . as a first approximation ,",
    "the abundances within the rocky bodies in the solar system can be explained by this scenario .",
    "for example , based solely on solar abundances , carbon should be one of the most abundant elements within a rocky planet . however , in a cosmochemical environment , it is highly volatile and strongly depleted both in the inner solar system @xcite and in extrasolar asteroids @xcite .",
    "similarly , water - ice is much more abundant in the outer solar system than in the inner solar system @xcite .",
    "the depletions of c and s in the parent body accreted onto gd 40 are similar to those of bulk earth while the upper bound of n in the accreted material is consistent with bulk earth s low fractional mass of this element . also , the abundances of the refractories are mostly similar to those in bulk earth except for an unexplained enhancement of ca and possibly ti . therefore , the formation pathway of the parent body that orbited gd 40 may have been analogous to the formation of earth .",
    "although c and n are substantially depleted in the parent body accreted onto g241 - 6 , the solar abundance of s suggests that the material condensed at a temperature less than 600 k. therefore , the formation route of the parent body that orbited this star may have been more similar to that of the cv chondrites .",
    "the volatiles deficiencies in gd 40 and g241 - 6 seem to be part of a more general pattern of the parent bodies accreted onto db white dwarfs in aggregate likely having formed interior to a snow line @xcite .",
    "although similar , the abundances of gd 40 and g241 - 6 are not identical . as seen in table 5 ,",
    "while the dominant lighter elements  o and mg  have nearly the same abundance , the elements as heavy or heavier than ca are all more abundant in gd 40 by as much as a factor of 2.5 .",
    "a natural explanation of this difference is that accretion onto g241 - 6 has effectively stopped and that we are now witnessing a system in a decaying phase where the heavy elements gravitationally settle before the lighter elements .",
    "this scenario is consistent with gd 40 s possession of a dust disk and the absence of any circumstellar dust orbiting g241 - 6 .",
    "therefore , our  conservative \" approach in assuming that g241 - 6 is in the  build - up \" phase may overestimate the mass fractions of the relatively light volatiles , but it correspondingly may underestimate the mass fractions of the relatively heavy refractories .",
    "sulfur and silicon have nearly the same atomic weight and gravitationally settle at nearly the same speed .",
    "as illustrated in the modeling of @xcite , the imputed mass fraction carried by silicon ",
    "intermediate in mass between oxygen and iron  is approximately constant during an episode where the accretion rate varies by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "consequently , the inferred sulfur mass fraction is insensitive to whether the system is a build - up or steady - state phase .",
    "even if g241 - 6 is in a final , declining phase , the likely corrections to the relative abundances of the heavy elements are approximately a factor of two ; such adjustments would not lead to a qualitative change in our analysis .",
    "we now briefly assess whether during either star s high - luminosity asymptotic giant branch evolution prior to becoming a white dwarf , the composition of the asteroids was dramatically altered by sublimation and the consequent loss of volatile elements . according to idealized calculations @xcite ,",
    "less than half of any initial internal h@xmath4o is likely to be lost during such a phase by an asteroid with a radius greater than 60 km .",
    "the parent body accreted onto gd 40 had a radius of at least 120 km @xcite , and therefore sublimation during the pre - white dwarf evolution of the star is unlikely to explain the deficiency of volatiles in the accreted asteroid .",
    "because gd 40 has an infrared excess , it is likely that a single , large asteroid is responsible for the observed pollution ; otherwise the dust particles in the disk likely would have been destroyed by mutual collisions @xcite . for g241 - 6 , a similarly large mass is required to explain the observed pollution and probably the pollution was delivered by one large parent body @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that the inferred deficiencies of volatiles were established when the planetesimals formed .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath3100 km asteroids are differentiated because of substantial heating by radioactive elements @xcite .",
    "because the source of @xmath27al  the primary source of heating @xcite  in the early solar system is unknown @xcite , it is uncertain how to compute the thermal evolution in extrasolar planetary systems . the degree to which complex , differentiated asteroids with porosity and hydrated minerals can retain their water and other volatiles is unknown and needs to be addressed in future models .    in the parent bodies accreted onto gd 40 and g241 - 6 , a simple thermal processing model can explain the bulk compositions .",
    "however , it is most unlikely that all extrasolar asteroids are volatile depleted ; @xcite report that a suite of older dz white dwarfs have , on average , nearly solar sodium abundance .",
    "this element has a 50% condensation temperature of 958 k @xcite and is deficient relative to solar in bulk earth @xcite .",
    "possibly these stars with cooling ages near 2 gyr are polluted by a different class of planetesimal than gd 40 and g241 - 6 which have cooling ages near 0.2 gyr @xcite .",
    "elaboration of dynamic models for the orbital perturbations of planetesimals such as those computed by @xcite or @xcite may allow us to determine when to expect accretion of volatile - rich or volatile - poor planetesimals .",
    "besides thermal processing , other processes such as differentiation may also be important @xcite in determining the composition of extrasolar asteroids .",
    "it is most valuable in testing models for planetesimal formation and evolution to measure mass fractions of as many different elements as possible . as summarized by @xcite , seven white dwarfs",
    "have been found to be polluted by at least eight different elements .",
    "future studies of such extensively polluted white dwarfs may elucidate different evolutionary pathways taken by extrasolar planetesimals .",
    "we have found in the white dwarfs gd 40 and g241 - 6 that two highly volatile elements  carbon and nitrogen  comprise only a small fraction of the mass in the accreted parent bodies .",
    "the deficiency of these two volatiles parallels what is measured for bulk earth and previous studies showing that in aggregate , there was relatively little water - ice embedded in the ensemble of planetesimals accreted onto nearby externally - polluted white dwarfs with helium - dominated atmospheres sulfur is significantly depleted in gd 40 but not g241 - 6 .",
    "in contrast , elements with condensation temperatures greater than 1000 k have mass fractions similar to those measured in bulk earth and chondrites .",
    "this contrast between volatiles and refractories is consistent with scenarios where the composition of a planetesimal is strongly dependent upon the radial location in the disk where it was formed .",
