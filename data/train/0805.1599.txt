    "it was found that a complicated pattern of polarization singularities is formed as a result of the anisotropy induced symmetry breaking .    in our recent investigation into the two - dimensional angular distributions of the stokes parameters describing the polarization structure behind the conoscopic images we performed a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the polarization state of the light transmitted through nematic liquid crystal ( nlc ) cells as a function of the incidence angles  @xcite .",
    "this polarization structure    the so - called _ polarization resolved angular ( conoscopic ) pattern _    is represented by the field of polarization ellipses and results from the interference of four eigenmodes excited in nlc cells by the plane waves with varying direction of incidence .",
