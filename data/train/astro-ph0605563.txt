    "the 1% uncertainty on the distance @xcite is negligible by comparison . ]",
    "this represents about 70% of the bolometric flux of gl 570d .",

    "a combination of age indicators shows that the gl 570 system is between 2 and 5@xmath1gyr old @xcite , which constrains the range of the gravity to that shown by the isochrones in fig . 1 and the models in table 1 .",
    "models a and c bracket the age limits and model b corresponds to the midpoint .",

    "the atmosphere models have steadily improved , most notably with the inclusion of a more extensive line list for ch@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "finally , the evolution is computed with an independent code , using our cloudless atmosphere grid as the surface boundary condition , rather than relying on the sequences of @xcite .",
    "despite all these changes , the parameters obtained for gl 570d are remarkably similar to those of @xcite ( crosses on fig .",
    "1 ) . most of the difference can be attributed to a shift of the isochrones in the @xmath11 plane between our evolution sequences and those of @xcite caused mainly by the different surface boundary conditions .",
    "this shows that the method is quite robust and that further improvements in the models will not affect the values in table 1 significantly .",
    "figure 1 shows that the main uncertainty in the @xmath11 of gl 570d arises from the uncertainly in the age of the system . by comparison ,",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath22 from the flux calibration of the data is small .",
    "given @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the radius @xmath23 from the evolution , and the parallax of gl 570a , we can compute model fluxes at earth that can be compared directly to the data . the model b spectrum",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "this is not a fit of the spectrum _",
    "per se _ , but it is obtained solely from the procedure outlined above . the agreement with the optical and near - ir data is generally excellent . the deviations in the 1.6  1.7@xmath7 m region are due to the incomplete ch@xmath21 line list .",
    "the reason for the underestimated @xmath24 band flux is unclear .",
    "models computed with the slightly higher metallicity of gl 570a would give a higher @xmath24 band flux .",
    "a similar effect could also be obtained by flux redistribution from a stronger ch@xmath21 1.6@xmath7 m band computed from a more complete line list .",
    "we find that a cloudy model with a thin cloud deck parameterized by a sedimentation parameter @xmath25 @xcite , can also improve substantially the agreement with the observed @xmath24 band peak .    in the mid - ir",
    ", the model systematically underestimates the flux beyond 9@xmath7 m , which coincides with strong absorption by nh@xmath5 .",
    "the outlier models ( a & c in table 1 ) give very similar synthetic spectra .",
    "the differences remain below @xmath26mjy in the near - ir and below @xmath27mjy in the mid - ir , with higher gravity models giving lower fluxes .",
    "vertical transport in the atmosphere of a t dwarf will result in a reduced nh@xmath5 abundance , which will increase the model flux for @xmath28 m and improve the agreement with the irs spectrum .",
    "we consider atmosphere models that depart from chemical equilibrium to optimize the fit to the data .",
    "the kinetics of the chemistry of carbon and nitrogen in giant planets and brown dwarfs has been described in details in @xcite and the effect on the spectra of brown dwarfs in @xcite .",
    "we only provide a brief summary of nonequilibrium chemistry here .      the chemistry of carbon and nitrogen in brown dwarfs atmospheres is essentially described by the net reactions @xmath29 @xmath30 because of the large binding energies of co and n@xmath31 , both reactions proceed much more slowly to the right than to the left .",
    "vertical mixing dredges up hot gas that is relatively rich in co and n@xmath31 to the cooler part of the atmosphere , where co and n@xmath31 are converted very slowly into ch@xmath21 and nh@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the net result is a relative overabundance of co and n@xmath31 in the upper atmosphere and decreased abundances of ch@xmath21 and nh@xmath5 in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath31o is also reduced by conservation of the total number of oxygen atoms .",
    "the correct chemical pathway and reaction time scale for the conversion of co into ch@xmath21 remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "we adopt the `` fast '' chemical time scale of @xcite . for the n@xmath31 conversion",
    ", we adopt the time scale given in @xcite .",
    "slow mixing can occur in the radiative zones of atmospheres through a variety of processes such as the turbulent decay of waves propagated upward from the convective / radiative boundary and instabilities arising from rapid rotation . in the absence of any detailed modeling of these processes ,",
    "we adopt a simple model of vertical mixing by eddy turbulence @xcite .",
    "this process is analogous to diffusion and occurs over a characteristic time scale @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the pressure scale height and @xmath24 is the coefficient of eddy diffusion .",
    "@xmath24 ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath35@xmath16/s in planetary stratospheres and it is the only free parameter in our non - equilibrium models .",
    "the time scale for mixing in the atmospheric convection zone is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the convective mixing length and velocity , respectively , and are evaluated with the mixing length theory . for convenience , we choose @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 .",
    "the chemical abundance profiles @xcite in model atmosphere b are shown in fig .",
    "3 . depth in the atmosphere is indicated by the local temperature .",
    "the equilibrium abundances are shown with dashed lines that overlap solid lines for h@xmath31o and ch@xmath21 .",
    "the transition in the carbon chemistry from co deep in the atmosphere to ch@xmath21 near the surface occurs at @xmath41 .",
    "the n@xmath31 to nh@xmath5 transition occurs around @xmath42 .",
    "remarkably , and in contrast to the carbon chemistry , the n@xmath31/nh@xmath5 equilibrium ratio remains nearly constant deep in the atmosphere due to a near cancellation of the increased temperature ( favoring n@xmath31 ) and the increased pressure ( favoring nh@xmath5 ) along this portion of the atmosphere profile .",
    "the chemical time scales for the conversion of co and n@xmath31 are shown by the heavy solid and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "these vary over more than 20 orders of magnitude throughout the atmosphere and become extremely long in the upper atmosphere .",
    "mixing occurs rapidly in the convection zone but it is about 7 orders of magnitude slower in the radiative zone for our choice of @xmath43@xmath16/s . in regions where @xmath44 , chemical equilibrium prevails . where @xmath45 , however , abundances of co , ch@xmath21 , n@xmath31 , nh@xmath5 and h@xmath31o will depart from equilibrium ( solid lines ) .",
    "the nonequilibrium mole fractions are approximately determined by their values where @xmath46 . in our calculation",
    ", we adopt the scheme of @xcite to determine this `` quenching level . ''",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , there can be more than one level where @xmath46 , resulting in alternating zones in and out of chemical equilibrium . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only the uppermost ( lowest @xmath47 ) crossing .",
    "it turns out that in all cases , this is an excellent approximation to the full solution for the chemical profile since the deeper quenching occurs well below the level of formation of the corresponding molecular bands .",
    "figure 3 shows that above the co quenching level ( @xmath48 ) the nonequilibrium abundance of co is orders of magnitude higher than at equilibrium .",
    "the abundances of ch@xmath21 and h@xmath31o are barely affected for this choice of @xmath24 ( slow mixing ) .",
    "the nh@xmath5 abundance is reduced by about one order of magnitude in the upper atmosphere . in this model",
    ", n@xmath31 is quenched below the bottom of the atmosphere model , in a region where n@xmath31/nh@xmath5 is still nearly constant .",
    "the fact that the equilibrium mole fraction of nh@xmath5 is nearly constant for @xmath49 implies that the non - equilibrium nh@xmath5 abundance profile is completely insensitive to the choice of the eddy mixing coefficient @xmath24 over a very wide range ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this means that _ all _ plausible choices of @xmath24 will give the same nh@xmath5 abundance and therefore the same mid - ir spectrum .      in view of the above remarks , we arbitrarily choose @xmath51@xmath16/s to compute nonequilibrium spectra for the three models in table 1 .",
    "besides the choice of equilibrium or nonequilibrium chemistry , the only fitting parameter left is the gravity , constrained to be between the values for models a and c ( table 1 ) .",
    "we determine the goodness of fit of a synthetic spectrum by computing the @xmath52 between the model and the data for @xmath53 m , which is where nh@xmath5 features are seen in the spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "model spectra are smoothed to the irs short low point source spectral resolution of @xmath54 with a gaussian filter and then binned to the instrument s wavelength sampling . the uncertainty ( @xmath55 ) on the fitted @xmath52",
    "is obtained by fitting 5000 simulated data sets generated by adding a random gaussian noise distribution to each pixel with a width given by the individual pixel noise ( @xmath56mjy ) .",
    "we also fit renormalized spectra to account for the @xmath57% calibration uncertainty , which turns out to be the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "nonequilibrium model c always gives the best fit .",
    "a reasonable fit ( @xmath58 worse than model c ) is obtained with nonequilibrium model b if the observed flux is increased by the full 6.5% uncertainty .",
    "the best equilibrium model fit is @xmath59 worse than the best nonequilibrium model fit .",
    "the nonequilibrium model c spectrum is shown by the dashed ( blue ) curve on fig .",
    "the agreement with the data is remarkable considering that all we have done is include non - equilibrium chemistry to the calculation and increase the gravity slightly , with no other free parameter .",
    "we conclude that the nh@xmath5 abundance is reduced by nonequilibrium chemistry and that the parameters of gl 570d fall between models b and c , and much more likely closer to the latter .",
    "we briefly consider five possible explanations that could account for the enhanced mid - ir flux in gl 570d : a low nitrogen abundance , an error in the temperature profile of the atmosphere , uncertain nh@xmath5 opacity , time variability , and photodissociation of nh@xmath5 .",
    "the metallicity of gl 570d is very nearly solar , based on abundance determinations of na , si , ca , ti , v , cr , fe , co , and ni in gl 570a that range from [ x / h]@xmath60 to 0.24 , with a typical spread of @xmath61 between independent determinations @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "however , the n abundance has not been measured . a low [ n / h ] value would result in a decreased nh@xmath5 abundance that could potentially explain the relatively high mid - ir flux .",
    "the dependance of the mole fraction of ammonia on the nitrogen abundance is @xmath62[n / h ] @xcite . in our models ,",
    "the strongest nh@xmath5 absorption occurs at a depth of @xmath63 in the atmosphere where the non - equilibrium chemistry reduces @xmath64 by a factor of 10 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . to obtain a similar reduction from a low nitrogen abundance would require [ n / h]@xmath65 , which would be an extreme departure from the abundances of other metals in gl 570a .    in principle ,",
    "n - bearing condensates may also cause a depletion of n - bearing gases in the atmosphere .",
    "however , there are no n - bearing condensates expected along the @xmath66 profile of gl 570d that can significantly remove nitrogen , and temperatures are not low enough to allow nh@xmath21sh or nh@xmath5 condensation as in the much cooler upper atmospheres of the jovian planets .",
    "our determination of @xmath22 and our solution for @xmath11 are in excellent agreement with the values obtained by @xcite without the benefit of the irs spectrum .",
    "this indicates that while the near - ir flux has remained constant , the unknown mid - ir flux of gl 570d in march 2000 could not be significantly different from that measured in feb 2005 . the fact that our equilibrium model is in very good agreement with the full sed of gl 570d ( fig .",
    "2 ) supports the notion that all pieces of the sed are consistent with each other .",
    "finally , @xmath9 would have to increase to @xmath67k to obtain an equilibrium nh@xmath5 mole fraction similar to the non - equilibrium value needed to fit the irs spectrum .",
    "such a high @xmath9 is completely incompatible with _ all _ of the gl 570d observations .",
    "if we consider the temperature profile of the atmosphere , an increase of over 200@xmath1k ( @xmath68% ) at @xmath69bar would be required ; an implausible error in our models , an inconsitent with the near - ir spectrum of gl 570d .",
    "the opacity of nh@xmath5 is computed from a line list obtained by combining the geisa @xcite and hitran @xcite data bases , complemented with recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations ( see @xcite for more details ) . to our knowledge , this compilation of nh@xmath5 opacity is the most complete presently available . nonetheless , the line list is only complete up to @xmath70k and transitions arising from levels that are excited only at higher temperatures are underrepresented or missing .",
    "qualitatively , the nh@xmath5 opacity we calculate for gl 570d is a lower limit to the actual opacity , implying that the derived underabundance of nh@xmath5 is an _",
    "upper _ limit .",
    "more quantitatively , the 914@xmath7 m band of nh@xmath5 arises from the ground state ( @xmath71 ) , with a small overlaping contribution from the @xmath72 excited state ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the energy differences between other excited vibrational states of nh@xmath5 is too large for the corresponding hot bands to overlap with the @xmath71 band .",
    "we are confident that the line list for the 914@xmath7 m band on which our analysis of the abundance of nh@xmath5 is based is quite complete .",
    "the spectroscopic data analyzed here was gathered over a period of several years : the optical spectrum is from observations taken in march 2000 and feb 2001 @xcite , the near - ir spectrum in march 2000 @xcite and the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum in february 2005 @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the luminosity of gl 570d may have varied during this 5 year period , affecting our determination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and fortuitously result in our excellent fit of the combined spectrum with a model departing from chemical equilibrium .",
    "@xcite do not report any variation in the optical flux of gl 570d between their two observations taken one year apart , and the reported equivalent width of cs i and rb i lines show no variation within 1.5@xmath55 .",
    "the near ir spectrum is calibrated to @xmath74 mko photometry taken in feb 2000 @xcite .",
    "repeat observations in july 2005 are fully consistent ( @xmath75 ) with the original photometry .",
    "the 2mass photometry of gl 570d was obtained in may 1998 . applying the color transformations of @xcite shows agreement to @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath24 ) with the mko magnitudes .",
    "based primarily on the stability of the near - ir mko photometry , we conclude that any time variability in gl 570d over a period of 7 years is at most at the 2 - 3% level .",
    "this is less than our estimate of a 5.7% uncertainty on @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the possibility that the absolute mid - ir flux may not be representative of the average or typical state of gl 570d .",
    "if we relax the absolute flux calibration of the irs spectrum , do we still see a nh@xmath5 depletion ? for this purpose , we have repeated the fitting procedure described in  5.4 , with the flux calibration adjusted by a factor that minimizes the value of @xmath52 . allowing for the estimated noise in each pixel of the observed spectrum , we find that the non - equilibrium models always fit better than the equilibrium models at the @xmath79 level , with insignificant variation between models a , b and c.      nh@xmath5 is a molecule that is easily dissociated by uv photons @xmath80 . since gl 570d is a companion to a main sequence star , it is possible that the uv flux from the primary results in a depletion of nh@xmath5 in gl 570d",
    ". this process was discussed in details by @xcite in the case of another late t dwarf with a companion , gl 229b , where it was found to be completely negligible at the level of the photosphere . by comparison ,",
    "the uv flux of the dk4 star gl 570a is about 10 times larger than that of the dm1 star gl 229a ( based on the nextgen models of @xcite ) but the flux incident on gl 570d is smaller because of the much greater projected separation ( 1525@xmath1au @xcite rather than 44@xmath1au @xcite for gl 229b ) .",
    "since the atmospheres of both brown dwarfs are quite similar , we can expect that the photodissociation of nh@xmath5 in gl 570d will be @xmath81 times that in gl 229b . the gl 570 bc pair of m dwarfs lies about 10 times closer to gl 570a than gl 570d and their contribution to the uv flux incident on gl 570d is a small correction to the above estimate .",
    "our method to determine @xmath9 and the gravity of brown dwarfs is most effective when applied to objects with known parallax and which are members of systems where the primary provides the metallicity and age indicators .",
    "the method is based on integrated fluxes and evolution sequences rather than a direct fit of the spectrum , an approach that largely eliminates biases due to remaining systematic problems in the model spectra . with recalibrated optical and near - ir spectra and , most importantly , a _",
    "irs spectrum , we have redetermined @xmath11 for gl 570d to find nearly the same values as @xcite .",
    "an excellent fit of the irs spectrum can only be obtained if the nh@xmath5 abundance reduced by nearly one order of magnitude in the upper atmosphere .",
    "this is most readily explained by vertical mixing that drives the nitrogen chemistry away from chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we have considered several other possible explanations but none of them are plausible .",
    "we find that in late t dwarfs , the nonequilibrium n@xmath31/nh@xmath5 ratio generally does not depend on the efficiency of mixing in the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , while the 10  11@xmath7 m band of nh@xmath5 is a sensitive indicator of nonequilibrium chemistry in brown dwarf atmospheres , it provides little information about the efficiency of mixing . on the other hand",
    ", the co abundance is very sensitive to the choice of the mixing parameter @xmath24 , and photometric or spectroscopic observations of the 4.7@xmath7 m co band is the most effective way to determine @xmath24 .",
    "our study provides the most accurate parameters of any known brown dwarf ( fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath0  820@xmath1k , @xmath82  5.23 , @xmath83  0.0853 , @xmath84 to @xmath4 , @xmath85  47 and an age of 3 to 5gyr . the upper limit of this range ( fig .",
    "1 ) is at least @xmath58 more likely than the lower limit .",
