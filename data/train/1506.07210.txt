    "bose - einstein condensation occurs when a dilute gas of bosonic atoms is cooled below a critical temperature where a considerable fraction of the atoms occupy the same quantum state according to bose - einstein statistics .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) were first theorized by bose and einstein in the 1920s  @xcite but not experimentally realized until 1995  @xcite for which the 2001 nobel prize in physics was awarded  @xcite . typically , rubidium or sodium atoms are used and are cooled to nanokelvin temperatures using a combination of laser an evaporative cooling .",
    "the condensate is held in position by a combination of magnetic and optical traps . for sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the mean field dynamics of becs in a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) trap can be accurately described by the so - called gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation that is a variant of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation incorporating the external trapping potential  @xcite . by appropriately adimensionalizing time , length and energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , it is possible to cast the 1d gp equation as @xmath0 where the rescaled condensate wavefunction is given by @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the effective 1d ( magnetic ) trapping potential confining the bec and @xmath3 indicates whether the atoms have an attractive ( @xmath4 ) or repulsive ( @xmath5 ) scattering length .",
    "this 1d reduction of the system is achieved by the so - called cigar - shaped external trapping potential for which two transverse directions are tightly confining ( such that , effectively , only the ground state along these direction is possible ) while the longitudinal ( in our case @xmath6 ) direction is loosely trapped allowing for the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) to evolve along this direction .",
    "since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation , the study of this new form of matter has been the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental efforts  @xcite .",
    "becs continue to be a testbed for accessing quantum mechanics at a macroscopic level allowing for direct observation of matter - wave solitons  @xcite . under strong transverse confinement in two spatial directions ,",
    "a bec can be rendered effectively quasi-1d  @xcite . in this case , depending on the sign of the scattering length between the bec entities ( usually alkali atoms ) , it is possible to observe bright  @xcite ( for attractive interactions ) and dark  @xcite ( for repulsive interactions ) solitons . in the present work , we are interested in studying the collective dynamics of chains of these 1d solitons and , specifically , the possibility of stable solutions that coherently propagate compression waves along the soliton chain .",
    "solitons are ubiquitous nonlinear waves that occur in a wide range of physical systems such as plasmas , molecular chains , optical fibers , and long water waves  @xcite . in many physically relevant setups solitons",
    "are extremely robust ( with respect to parametric perturbations ) and stable ( with respect to configuration perturbations ) . they can interact elastically with other solitons , travel long distances , and travel through inhomogeneities with minimal deformation and dispersion .",
    "this striking stability relies on the balance between dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "for instance , in the absence of external trapping ( @xmath7 ) and for the case of an attractive condensate ( @xmath4 ) , the homogeneous background gp ( [ gpe ] ) accepts exact _ bright _ soliton ( bs ) solutions of the form  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the amplitude ( and inverse width ) of the soliton , @xmath10 is its position ( @xmath11 being its initial location ) and its phase is given by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being its initial phase ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of a repulsive condensate , for a homogeneous and stationary background density , the gp equation ( [ gpe ] ) accepts exact _ dark _ soliton ( ds ) solutions of the form  @xcite @xmath14 \\ , e^{i\\phi_{\\rm ds}(t ) }",

    "the parameters of the ds are related by the following expressions : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    in this work",
    "we study the collective dynamics of chains of interaction bright and dark solitons .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to describing the dynamical reduction where the evolution of a chain of well separated and nearly identical solitons can be reduced , for both bss and dss , to a chain of effective particles connected with nonlinear springs modelled by the fundamental toda lattice on the soliton s positions .",
    "section  [ sec : tl ] is devoted to constructing appropriate initial conditions for the original gp equation to support toda lattice solitons riding on chains of bss and dss , a.k.a  _ hypersolitons_. we present numerical results from direct integration of the gp equation which very closely match the solutions of the corresponding toda lattice prediction .",
    "we describe the robustness of the constructed hypersoliton solutions and present some typical collision scenarios .",
    "also , in this section , motivated by the presence of harmonic trapping in typical bec experiments , we study the effects of considering a finite soliton chain that is confined at the bottom of the external potential . specifically",
    ", we present numerical results for a finite chain of dss supported by an external harmonic trap giving rise to dynamics that are akin to the oscillations of the classical newton s cradle . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] we summarize our results and present possible avenues for further research .",
    "in this section we summarize the dynamical reduction for chains of bss and dss . under suitable conditions , _ both _",
    "systems reduce to a toda lattice on the position of the solitons . hence , by initializing the soliton train s positions and velocities according to the toda lattice soliton , a travelling compression pulse can be sustained .",
    "the bs solution ( [ eq : bs ] ) describes the coherent evolution of a density heap on a zero background in an attractive quasi-1d bec in the absence of an external confining potential . when an external trapping potential is included and/or in the presence of other bss , the bs is perturbed inducing a deformation of its shape . however , under small perturbations , and noting that bss are robust , it is possible to approximately describe the dynamics of the bs by the ansatz ( [ eq : bs ] ) as long as its amplitude , width , position , velocity and phase are dynamically adjusted to follow accurately the actual solution of the system .",
    "for instance , in the presence of a magnetic trap of the form @xmath20 where the strength of the trap @xmath21 is small ( compared to the soliton width ) , a single bs solution will undergo left - to - right periodic oscillations of frequency @xmath21  @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "( [ eq : bs ] ) ] , their interaction dynamics can be reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes )  @xcite .",
    "these reduced odes depend on all the parameters of the solitons .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is determined by the relative phase of consecutive ( @xmath31 ) bss .",
    "namely , @xmath32 corresponds to out - of - phase ( oop ) bss ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 corresponds to in - phase ( ip ) bss ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this means that oop bss experience mutual repulsion while ip bss experience mutual attraction .",
    "it is evident that a homogeneous , equidistant , chain of bss described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs_ode1 ] ) is a fixed point of the system .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to prove that this fixed point in the reduced model is unstable in the case of ip bss and it is neutrally stable for oop bss .",
    "however , stability of the fixed point in the reduced model does not imply stability of the steady state of the original gp system .",
    "in fact , stability of the reduced model is a necessary but not sufficient condition for stability of the original gp system .",
    "-0.0 cm +    since we are interested in excitations of the homogeneous chain , let us first study their stability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_random ] , we depict typical time evolutions corresponding to an ip ( top - left ) and oop ( top - right ) bs chain .",
    "the system is initialized using the numerical steady state of the gp system with periodic boundary conditions found using a standard fixed point iteration algorithm with a small perturbation .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , both the ip and oop cases are unstable .",
    "the nature of the instability seems , however , different .",
    "the ip case , for which we know that even in the reduced ode model is unstable due to the mutual attraction between bss , seems to be strongly unstable .",
    "the instability is manifested by two neighboring bs coalescing as early as @xmath36 .",
    "this instability is easy to understand since a small perturbation will induce two neighboring bss to be slightly closer than its other neighbors , thus accelerating the process of attraction and hence leading to a rapid collision between these two bss . on the other hand , in the oop case",
    ", the reduced chain is neutrally stable and , thus , perturbations with respect to the positions of the bss from the equidistant chain should not cause instabilities . as shown in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_random ] , this is the case for intermediate times ( @xmath37 ) where the mutual repulsion between bss is responsible for collision avoidance between neighboring bss . nonetheless ,",
    "as the panel shows , for later times , @xmath38 , a collision between neighboring bss does indeed occur .",
    "the presence of a collision is unequivocal evidence that the involved bss where not oop when they collided .",
    "in fact , the loss of the oop property between consecutive bss is precisely what induces the instability of the otherwise oop initial bs chain .",
    "the desynchronization between the phases can be clearly seen in the bottom two subpanels of fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_random ] .",
    "the panels depict the time evolution of the relative phase between consecutive bss that initially start in the ip ( top subpanel ) and the oop ( bottom subpanel ) configurations .",
    "it is clear that the oop property between consecutive bss is approximately held for intermediate times ( see @xmath37 in the bottom subpanel ) ensuring the mutual repulsion between consecutive bss and , thus , stability for the chain .",
    "however , it is also clear that the oop property gets progressively worse until a pair of consecutive bss have a _ zero _ relative phase between them , i.e.  they are ip around @xmath39 , inexorably leading to their collision .    -0.5",
    "cm    to further understand the nature of the instability , we have computed the bogolyubov - de gennes ( bdg ) stability spectrum for the ip and oop steady states of the gp system . the bdg spectrum is computed by considering perturbations from the steady state @xmath40 of the following form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the so - called chemical potential ( or [ the negative of ] the temporal frequency ) of the solution , @xmath43 is the eigenvalue with associated eigenvector @xmath44 , and where @xmath45 stands for complex conjugation . after applying the perturbation ansatz ( [ eq : bdg ] ) into the gp equation ( [ gpe ] ) and linearizing the ensuing equation ,",
    "one obtains an eigenvalue problem with a corresponding eigenfunction @xmath46 at @xmath47 . after computing the spectrum ,",
    "any eigenvalue @xmath48 with a positive real part ( @xmath49 ) indicates an unstable eigenfunction .",
    "the spectrum associated with the ip and oop steady states is depicted , respectively , in the left and right top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : stab_bs ] .",
    "as is can be noticed , the oop spectrum has a handful of complex eigenvalues with a _ small _ ( @xmath50 ) real part indicating a weak instability .",
    "in contrast , the ip case reveals a larger ( purely real ) instability with @xmath51 , indicating a stronger instability . closer inspection of the unstable eigenfunctions ( see bottom set of panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab_bs ] ) reveals that the instabilities manifest themselves as local translational modes for consecutive bss in the opposite direction and , thus , bringing them closer to each other .",
    "we have checked that the stability results above ( cf .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_random ] and  [ fig : stab_bs ] ) are very similar for other values of the parameters such as amplitude , number , and separation of the bss , as well as different domain lengths .",
    "evidently , as more bss are included in the system , a higher degeneracy of the eigenvalues arises since all solutions and eigenfunctions posses translational symmetry .",
    "finally , it is relevant to mention that the bs chain might be rendered stable by a suitable choice of periodic lattice potential providing stabilizing pinning for each bs located at the respective minimum of the lattice potential  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not explore this avenue further in this manuscript .    since the ip bs chain is highly unstable",
    ", we will focus our attention in the case of the weakly unstable oop chain .",
    "therefore , let us consider the case @xmath52 for which the reduced equation of motion yields @xmath53 which has precisely the form of the celebrated toda lattice  @xcite that is further described below .",
    "it is important to mention at this stage that the restriction of locked phases between bss ( ip or oop ) is not necessary to obtain a toda lattice - type model .",
    "in fact , by allowing the phase of each bs to dynamically evolve , the equations of motion ( [ 4n - ks ] ) reduce to a _ complex _",
    "toda lattice of the form @xcite : @xmath54 where the corresponding complex variable @xmath55 for this complex toda lattice is defined through the original bs s parameters by @xmath56 where @xmath9 and @xmath57 are the ensemble average height and velocity of the bss , while @xmath58 is the position of the @xmath59-th bs and the @xmath60 s are the bs phases and @xmath61 is their average .",
    "as was done in the previous section for the bs chain , the case of ds chains can also be reduced to a set of odes on the ds parameters .",
    "this reduction is obtained through ds perturbation theory as described in detail in refs .",
    "in particular , considering a ds ansatz of the form ( [ eq : ds ] ) for all dss in a chain supported on a constant background with density @xmath15 , the equations of motion are approximately reduced to @xmath62 which , as for the bs chain , is a form of the toda lattice  @xcite on the ds positions .",
    "the main difference between the reduced dynamics of bright and dark solitons that is worth pointing at this stage is that bss can have mutual interactions that are repulsive or attractive depending on their relative phases as described above . on the other hand ,",
    "dss are _ always _ repulsive .",
    "therefore , the stationary homogeneous , equidistant , ds chain is _ always _ stable .",
    "this observation will be crucial when comparing the dynamics of bs and ds chains from the gp model ( [ gpe ] ) and their respective dynamical reductions ( [ eq : bs_ode1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ds_ode ] ) .",
    "we now validate the dynamics obtained from the dynamical reduction for both bright and dark soliton chains . in order to numerically approximate an infinite lattice ,",
    "we take a periodic domain in the interval @xmath63 $ ] and place the solitons equidistant from each other accounting for the periodic boundary conditions . thus , considering @xmath64 solitons gives a steady state equidistant configuration such that @xmath65 for @xmath66 , where the distance @xmath67 is measured in the periodic domain such that @xmath68 .",
    "let us first consider a bs chain . as we described earlier , the perturbed equidistant chain evolves as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_random ] where the top left and right panels correspond , respectively , to the ip and oop cases .",
    "we have superimposed the corresponding dynamics of the reduced ode model of the bss ( [ eq : bs_ode2 ] ) using dashed lines .",
    "as can be observed from the figure , in the ip case ( top left panel ) before the collision of the bss ( @xmath69 ) , the ode model very closely follows the bs dynamics .",
    "after collision , the ode model breaks down as the bs centers coalesce and , thus , we only show the reduced ode orbit up to the first collision time . on the other hand , for intermediate times ,",
    "the oop chain ( top right panel ) does not suffer from the collision of bss as it assumes that all bss are _ always _ oop . the resulting reduced ode dynamics closely follows the original gp dynamics for short times , but later deteriorates since , as explained earlier , the bss lose the oop synchronization .",
    "nonetheless , for intermediate times , while the bss are kept separated , the reduced ode model does reproduce the original gp dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the bs chain , the ds chain does not suffer from phase - induced instabilities since dss _ always _ repel each other . as a result , the reduced ode model for the ds chain ( [ eq : ds_ode ] ) provides a very robust model for the gp dynamics under extended time evolutions for _ any _ initial condition provided the dss are initially well - separated .",
    "an example of the dynamics from the reduced toda lattice ode ( [ eq : ds_ode ] ) and the original gp model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_random ] , where a collection of dss placed at random locations with random initial velocities evolves in time .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the toda lattice model gives an accurate prediction of the ds positions for the original gp system for long times .",
    "before constructing toda lattice solitons on the chains of bright and dark solitons , let us review the form of these solutions for completeness .",
    "the toda lattice is one of the most popular models in physics since , by construction , it was designed as to prescribe a chain of _ nonlinear _ oscillators with completely integrable evolution  @xcite . as such",
    ", the toda lattice possesses some exact solutions that are the foundation for building more complex solutions .",
    "in particular , the toda lattice possesses periodic and localized solutions @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the latter type of solutions referred to as toda solitons .",
    "the toda lattice s equations of motion @xmath70            & = &   a\\,e^{-b(y_{n }   -y_{n-1 } ) } - a\\,e^{-b(y_{n+1 }   -y_{n } ) } , \\end{array } \\label{eq : tl}\\ ] ] originate from the interaction of nearest neighbors in a one - dimensional chain of coupled , unit mass , particles at positions @xmath71 , interacting through the potential @xmath72 here , @xmath73 is the separation between particles and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are positive parameters prescribing , respectively , the strength and decay of the inter - particle interactions . by following the evolution of the particles through their mutual separation @xmath76 and defining @xmath77 and @xmath78 so that @xmath79 , the equations of motion can be rewritten in term of @xmath80 as @xmath81 then , it is straightforward to find solitary kink solutions for this system in the form : @xmath82 where the kink velocity is @xmath83 and its amplitude @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 where the width of the kink @xmath86 is a free parameter",
    ". it should be noticed that this solution is stable and it corresponds to a compression wave that travels through the lattice  @xcite .",
    "we now seek to use the soliton solution for the toda lattice ( see previous section ) to construct a toda lattice soliton on the reduced lattice equations for the bright and dark soliton chains .",
    "let us consider an equilibrium configuration consisting of a chain of @xmath64 equidistant solitons with separation @xmath87 in the periodic domain @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "both oop bs and ds chains are reduced , respectively , to the toda lattice chains ( [ eq : bs_ode2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ds_ode ] ) where the toda lattice potential parameters are given in terms of soliton amplitude @xmath9 for the bs chain and in terms of the background density @xmath15 for the ds chain .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the uniform pre - compression experienced by the periodic chain effectively corresponds to a rescaling on the strength of the toda lattice potential @xmath74 .",
    "this is evident when rescaling the soliton positions by a factor @xmath88 , @xmath89 , then the exponential interaction terms become @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "let us start by initializing the chain of bss such that the initial positions and initial velocities satisfy the corresponding toda soliton ( [ eq : tl_kink ] ) .",
    "an example of this case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_tl ] for @xmath92 bss in the periodic chain @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the top panels depict the initial condition for the displacements from equilibrium between solitons @xmath94 ( left subpanel ) and their respective initial velocities @xmath95 .",
    "as it is evident from these panels , the kink ( [ eq : tl_kink ] ) corresponds to a localized _ compression _ wave for the soliton s positions .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this stage that contrary to the homogeneous , equidistant , chain where @xmath96 , for the chain initialized with the toda lattice solitons the length of the domain has to be adjusted since we are introducing a compression wave to the initial condition .",
    "thus , we compute the length of the domain by adding all the separations between consecutive solitons . the bottom row of panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_tl ] depicts the evolution of the density after seeding the original gp equation with the toda lattice soliton initial conditions on a pre - compressed bs chain .",

    "however , as we have described before , the bss will eventually lose their oop synchronization leading to the coalescence of two consecutive solitons .",
    "the first coalescence occurs approximately at @xmath98 for the right - most two solitons of the lattice .",
    "nonetheless , after this coalescence , the toda lattice soliton seems to reform again which , in turn , suffers from the coalescence of more bss as time progresses .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the reduced ode should fail after a bs pair loses its oop synchronization , and as it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , for oop initial conditions , the reduced ode model still captures the dynamics of the interacting chain for some time .",
    "nonetheless , as can be seen in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_bs_tl ] , after longer integration times ( 10 full cycles around the lattice ) , the toda soliton does not preserve its shape and other excitations start populating the dynamics , including toda solitons that apparently move in the opposite direction of the original toda soliton . by the same token ,",
    "it is also evident that the ode description ( see dashed line ) fails to capture the long term dynamics of the original gp system .",
    "this is evidence that the unstable character of the bs chain due to the desynchronization of the phases precludes satisfactory modeling of the full gp system with the reduced ode ( [ eq : bs_ode2 ] ) where all bss are assumed to be oop .    -0.7",

    "the problem of the desynchronization of the phases is naturally avoided and thus it should be possible to observe toda solitons travelling stably through the ds chain .",

    "[ fig : u2_perturb ] shows the dynamical evolution after using 30% , 50% , and 80% random initial perturbations to , both , initial relative positions and their respective velocities .",

    ", these perturbation seem to just provide some background noise over which the hypersoliton rides with minimal interaction .",
    "this background noise is more clearly visible in the bottom row of panels depicting the time derivative of the ( square root of the ) density .",
    "this remarkable robustness of the hypersoliton even after the addition of such large perturbations to the initial conditions that in turn develop into perturbations along the whole domain is due to two independent facts : ( a ) on the one hand , dss for the gp equation are very robust , a property owing from their topological charge , and ( b ) the structural stability of toda solitons of the toda lattice .",
    "these two stability properties , at two distinct levels of the model , combine to give the hypersoliton on the original gp model its robustness .",
    "-0.95 cm -0.25 cm -0.25 cm + -0.2 cm +      now that we have established the existence and stability of the hypersoliton solutions in ds chains , it is possible to study several dynamical aspects arising at this higher structural level .",
    "for example , one can initialize the ds chain with two ( or more ) hypersolitons and allow them to interact .",
    "it is expected that the dynamics governing the interactions between hypersolitons will be prescribed by the corresponding dynamics on the toda lattice .",
    "in particular , toda lattice solitons collide elastically without energy loss during the collision process .",
    "this is precisely what we observe for a wide range of cases when seeding two hypersolitons at different locations with different initial speeds ( if they have the same velocity they will chase each other indefinitely ) .",
    "figure [ fig : u2_collisions ] shows typical examples of hypersoliton collisions .",
    "specifically , the left , middle and right cases correspond , respectively to : ( a ) a head - on collision for opposite velocities with the same magnitude , ( b ) a head - on collision for velocities with different magnitudes , and ( c ) two chasing hypersolitons where a faster one chases a slower one until they collide . as the bottom panels show , all these collisions , as expected , are elastic ( i.e. , no energy is lost from the travelling hypersolitons before or after the collisions ) .",
    "it is interesting to note , as per the `` particle '' nature of the hypersoliton structures , owed to their nonlinear character , there is a shift in their paths when comparing their straight line trajectories [ in the @xmath105 plane ] before and after collision .",
    "this effect is clearly visible in the last case of fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_collisions ] where the fast soliton is advanced after collision while the slow one is delayed after collision .",
    "this effect will be important as we construct a quantum analog of the classical newton s cradle using hypersolitons in a chain of ds trapped inside a confining potential in the next section .",
    "we now proceed to study the effects of adding a confining external potential [ i.e. , @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) ] , relevant to the modelling of magnetically trapped becs , on the dynamics of hypersolitons supported by a finite ds chain . in the presence of the external parabolic potential ( [ eq : vmt ] ) , a single ds exhibits approximately harmonic oscillations with a frequency @xmath107 ( see refs .  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this result is valid in the so - called thomas - fermi limit corresponding to the high density limit .",

    "in fact , the toda lattice with the on - site potential ( [ eq : ds_ode_mt ] ) possesses a steady state solution emerging from the balance of the mutual repulsions between the dss and the attraction of the external trap towards the trap s center .",
    "this compressed steady state train of @xmath64 dss has @xmath64 distinct normal modes of vibration corresponding to the normal modes of vibration of @xmath64 coupled masses through ( linear ) springs with springs at each end attached to rigid walls . for example , for @xmath109 there",
    "exist 2 normal modes of vibration corresponding to the in - phase and out - of - phase modes of vibration of the dss  @xcite .",
    "-0.5 cm   +    -0.5 cm    instead of studying further the normal modes mentioned above , we opt here to emulate the dynamics of a classical newton s cradle using a chain of solitons .",
    "the idea is to start with an initial stationary chain of @xmath64 dss at the bottom of the parabolic trap and then drop a single , outer , ds from a position higher up in the trapping potential .",
    "this outer ds will experience the force of the trapping potential and ride down the external trap to collide with the stationary ds chain .",
    "the collision excites a moving hypersoliton within the inner ds chain .",
    "when the hypersoliton reaches the opposite extreme of the inner ds chain , a single ds is expelled outward .",
    "this new outer ds will ride up and down the trap until it hits the inner ds chain thus repeating the process of a soliton analogue of the classical newton s cradle .",
    "it is relevant to note at this stage that a similar idea was experimentally achieved in a 1d bose gas of @xmath110rb atoms by initially splitting a wavepacket into two wavepackets with opposite velocities .",
    "these packets then evolve by going up and down the trap and periodically colliding at the center  @xcite . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors propose another quantum analogue of a newton s cradle using a bec by partitioning the wavefunction using a periodic optical lattice potential .",
    "in contrast , our method to create a newton s cradle is based on the effective nonlinearity of the gp model and the repulsive interaction dynamics between dark solitons .",
    "figure [ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] depicts three different attempts at recreating a newton s cradle - type evolution with our setup . in these examples",
    ", we use a stationary ds chain of @xmath111 dss placed at the center of a magnetic trap of strength @xmath112 , namely @xmath113 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ds_ode_mt ] ) ] .",
    "the stationary inner ds chain is obtained by a fixed - point iteration ( newton s ) method initialized with a chain of dss with zero velocities positioned at the steady state locations .",
    "once the stationary inner lattice is found , an extra , outer , ds is seeded away from it .",
    "the distance of the outer ds to the inner ds chain is varied and the resulting evolution is analyzed .",
    "the three cases depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] correspond to , from left to right , an initial distance of the outer ds of ( a ) @xmath114 , ( b ) @xmath115 , and ( c ) @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the distance between the two innermost dss of the central chain . for case ( a ) ,",
    "corresponding to a short dropping distance of the ds , the newton s cradle dynamics is observed for a couple of periods but apparently the outer ds is `` absorbed '' by the inner chain resulting in a larger inner chain ( i.e. , @xmath118 dss ) that simply oscillates in the in - phase normal mode .",
    "the mechanism whereby the outer ds is absorbed by the inner lattice hinges on the fact that , although ds collision are elastic , there is a shift in the path of the dss with respect to the before and after collision trajectories as was shown before ( see discussion on the last collision depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : u2_collisions ] ) .",
    "the details of the outer ds `` absorption '' , or rather the energy exchange between the outer ds dynamics and the inner ds chain , is explained in fig .  [",
    "fig : cradle_schematic ] .",
    "this energy transfer is more clearly visible in the left - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] depicting the time derivative of the ( square root of the ) density . in this panel , it is clear that during the first hypersoliton excursion through the inner ds chain , there is practically no scattering of energy in the inner chain .",
    "however , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_schematic ] , just after the hypersoliton ejects the first ds , the inner chain has an extra ds on the left and is missing one ds on the right and thus , it is no longer close to equilibrium and starts to oscillate .",
    "this is clearly visible in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] for @xmath119 where the inner chain moves synchronously .",
    "this energy transfer mechanism continues until all the energy of the outer ds is completely depleted and the outer ds is absorbed by the inner lattice that oscillates with its in - phase normal mode ( results not shown here ) .",
    "-0.2 cm     in order to avoid , or minimize , the energy transfer between the outer ds and the inner ds chain , it is necessary to decouple the dynamics of the outer ds and the inner ds chain .",
    "this is achieved by increasing the dropping distance of the outer ds .",
    "as can be seen in the case depicted in the middle column of panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] , the excursion of the outer ds has very little effect on the inner chain motion .",
    "this can be explained because in this case , the outer ds travels faster through the inner chain and thus , the latter has less time to develop its in - phase normal mode .",
    "furthermore , as the period of the outer ds is different from the period of the inner chain in - phase mode , subsequent excursions of the outer ds do not synchronize with the in - phase mode .",
    "the outer ds has a different period in the presence of the inner ds chain because its trajectory in @xmath105 is the concatenation of sinusoids ( when the outer ds is traveling up and down the external trap on its own ) and straight paths ( when the hypersoliton traverses the inner chain ) .",
    "therefore , let us effectively consider the two involved dynamics , namely the outer soliton oscillations and the inner chain oscillations , as two coupled oscillators .",
    "these oscillators can synchronize provided that their periods are close to each other and that the coupling is sufficiently strong  @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what happens for a relatively small dropping distance as depicted in the first case of fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] .",
    "however , as we increase the dropping distance , the two coupled oscillators have increasingly different frequencies and , at the same time , the coupling is _ reduced _ as the interaction time between the two , given by the time it takes for the hypersoliton to traverse the inner chain , is reduced because of a faster hypersoliton speed .",
    "thus , in principle , there should be a threshold drop - off distance for which the newton s cradle should be self - maintained .",
    "this is what seems to be occurring in the case depicted in the middle column of fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] where apparently a very small amount of energy is transferred to the inner chain . to ensure that this small transfer does not destroy the newton s cradle , we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf20000 ] the same case as in the middle column of fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] , but for a longer time .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , there is indeed a transfer of energy from the outer ds to the inner chain for @xmath120 .",
    "however , the roles are inverted after this time and then the inner chain transfers back the energy to the outer ds ! this produces a beating phenomenon common for coupled oscillators with different periods .",
    "this periodic energy transfer between the outer ds and the inner chain seems to persists for very long times ( results not shown here ) providing a mechanism for a stable , long - lived , newton s cradle dynamics .    finally , the last column of fig .",
    "[ fig : cradle_tf2000 ] depicts an example with an even larger drop - off distance . in this case",
    ", the outer ds also interacts with the edge of the bec cloud and produces sounds waves that remove energy from the former and thus , finally settling to a newton s cradle with slightly lower oscillation amplitude with some background radiation ( sound waves ) prevailing in the condensate ( results not shown here ) .",
    "we construct coherent structures consisting of compression waves riding on chains of bright ( bs ) and dark ( ds ) solitons of the gp model .",
    "namely , a soliton riding on a chain of solitons and thus dubbed a _",
    "hypersoliton_. the dynamics for chains of bss and dss",
    "is reduced to a toda lattice on the solitons positions , i.e. , the solitons are modelled as a chain of nonlinearly coupled masses . then",
    ", the corresponding toda lattice solitons ( compression waves on the lattice ) can be initialized on the original gp model using the exact toda lattice soliton solution .",
    "we show how bs chains are inherently unstable due to phase desynchronization between consecutive bss and thus are poor candidates for supporting hypersolitons .",
    "in contrast , ds chains are stable and dss , being topologically charged , never lose their phases and thus are always mutually repelled from each other .",
    "we successfully craft hypersoliton solutions riding on ds chains of the original gp model for a wide range of parameter values .",
    "these hypersolitons are robust and stably travel at a constant speed without deformation nor radiation .",
    "additionally , we construct multiple hypersolitons and observe their elastic collisions in different head - on and chasing collisions scenarios .",
    "finally , inspired by the classical newton s cradle , we study the dynamics of finite ds chains trapped inside the customary parabolic external potential relevant in experimental bose - einstein condensates .",
    "this is achieved by letting a free , outer , soliton hit a stationary inner ds chain creating a hypersoliton wave travelling through the latter .",
    "as the hypersoliton reaches the end of the inner chain , a single ds is expelled and allowed to rise and fall down the external trap hitting the inner chain repeating the process in a manner akin to the classical newton s cradle .",
    "we study the effects of the drop - off distance on the formation of the newton s cradle dynamics and argue , in terms of the theory of coupled oscillators , that a minimal drop - off distance is required for the creation of self - sustained newton s cradle oscillations .",
    "the present work could be extended in a few interesting directions .",
    "for example the effects of finite temperatures in a condensate give rise to dissipation due to coupling with the thermal ( non condensed ) fraction .",
    "this dissipation can be modelled at the level of the gp equation by the so - called phenomenological dissipation  @xcite and it is responsible for anti - damping terms in the reduced equations of motion of the dss .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the effects of such a dissipative term on the dynamics of hypersolitons .",
    "on the other hand , condensates can be supported by two or more coupled components with linear and/or nonlinear coupling terms between them  @xcite .",
    "these coupled models give rise to coupled complexes with dark or bright solitons coupled to dark or bright solitons in the other component(s ) , thus giving rise to the so called dark - dark and dark - bright solitons  @xcite .",
    "the dynamically reduced models for these coupled systems take the form of coupled toda lattices  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to explore the possibility to construct hypersolitons and study their stability in systems with several components .",
