    "the advantage of using sz , instead of x - ray , observations is that the sz signal is proportional to the gas density , while the x  ray flux is proportional to the square of the density , and therefore the sz surface brightness drops considerably less rapidly with radius . assuming spherical models for the cluster gas and temperature profiles , @xcite concluded that strong shocks around the virial radii of clusters of galaxies should be detectable with high significance using _ alma _  mosaic observations .    in this paper , motivated by the proposal of @xcite",

    "we use a sample of 10 clusters of galaxies drawn from amr simulations , each located at redshift @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to them as amrcl1 through amrcl10 , sorted by their virial mass ( i.e. the total gravitational mass within the virial radius , @xmath1 , defined as in @xcite ) , amrcl1 being the most massive .",
    "the amr simulations were performed with the cosmological code enzo assuming a spatially flat @xmath0cdm  cosmology with ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , h , @xmath11 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.047 , 0.7 , 0.92 ) , where the hubble constant is @xmath12 = 100 h km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , and @xmath11 is the power spectrum normalization on 8 h@xmath13 mpc scales .",
    "this cosmological model is close to the _ wmap _  5 year results , except the simulations used a somewhat larger value of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the box size of the original simulation is 300 h@xmath13 mpc .",
    "the amr simulations were adiabatic ( in the sense that no radiative heating , cooling , star formation , or feedback were taken into account ) .",
    "the clusters of galaxies in our sample were re - simulated with high resolution using the same technique as described in @xcite .",
    "the virial masses of the clusters in our amr sample are in the range of 9.1@xmath14 @xmath15  - 2.3@xmath16 @xmath15 ; in table  [ t : table1 ] , we list the masses , radii , and dynamical state ( see below ) of each cluster .",
    "we are interested in accretion shocks around each cluster of galaxies ; therefore , we use spherical coordinates with the origin always placed at the center of mass of each cluster .",
    "we sample physical variables from the simulation output at spatial positions @xmath17 , described by the radial distance @xmath18 from the cluster center , and by the 2d angular position specified by a pixel number @xmath19 , based on the healpix   pixelization scheme with 3072 pixels @xcite .",
    "this coordinate system provides a convenient way of describing physical variables around collapsed objects .",
    "a 3d volume element in our coordinate system has the shape of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) healpix  pixel with a thickness of the corresponding radial bin , @xmath20 .",
    "the physical size of the 3d volume elements are larger at larger radii , but , in our case , that is desired because the resolution of the simulations also decreases with distance from the cluster center ( except for substructures , which are not important for our analysis ) . as an example , we show the resolution ( spherically averaged amr cell size ) as a function of radius in a typical relaxed cluster , amrcl9 ( @xmath21=1.1@xmath16 @xmath15 ) , in figure  [ f : fig1 ] ( points with error bars connected with solid line ) .",
    "the error bars represent the dispersion due to spherical averaging .",
    "we estimate the dispersion by calculating the standard deviations separately for data points that are larger and smaller than the mean ( upper and lower error bars ) . with the choice of 3072 pixels ,",
    "the healpixpixel sizes as a function of radius track the resolution of the simulations well ( within a factor of two ; compare the solid line with error bars and the straight solid line in figure  [ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the median resolution ( amr cell size ) of the high resolution simulations at @xmath22 = 0.1 , 1 and 4 ( where @xmath18 is the distance from the center of the cluster ) was about 25 , 80 and 300 kpc , respectively .",

    "head - on mergers in a stage close to pericentric passage would not be identified by this method ; however , we ignore this possibility , since such events are exceedingly rare , and are not expected to occur in our small sample . in total , we find three relaxed clusters in our amr sample .    in amr simulations ,",
    "the initial cells are adaptively divided into sub - cells , and the physical parameters are represented by values assigned to the center of the cells .",
    "we use a piecewise constant interpolation scheme to determine the physical variables at the center of our 3d volume elements .",
    "shocks in our amr sample of clusters of galaxies are identified based on regions of large compression , _",

    "[ f : fig2 ] we show the distribution of physical variables as a function of radius in three directions ( fixed pixels : @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; right , middle and left panels ) in a relaxed amr cluster , amrcl9 .",

    "we plot the gas density ( in units of the critical density , @xmath27 ) , temperature ( in kev ) , pressure ( in units of the central pressure , @xmath28 ) , radial velocity ( in km / s ) , and convergence profiles ( in units of @xmath29 ) with error bars .",
    "the error bars represent the dispersion ( standard deviation ) of a given parameter evaluated in all amr cells located within the 3d sampling volume element .",
    "note , however , that these values are only rough estimates because some volume elements contain only a few points ( we omitted error bars for those 3d volume elements that contain only one point ) .",
    "the dot - dashed lines on the density plots represent the universal background baryon mass density ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "pixels @xmath31 and @xmath25 are chosen toward directions that avoid any overdense filaments , pixel @xmath26 points toward a filament .",
    "the left panels ( pixel a ) represent an individual sight  line from the cluster center to a low  density , no  filament region with only one accretion shock . for reference ,",
    "the dashed curves on the density and radial velocity plots show the self - similar collapse solution of @xcite for the pressureless infall region .",
    "we fit the functional form of the radial velocity , @xmath32 , obtained by bertschinger ( equation 2.13 of bertschinger 1985 ) to the spherically averaged distribution of @xmath32  in this direction allowing the amplitude and the turn  around radius , @xmath33 , to change ( dashed curve ) . from this ,",
    "remarkably good fit , extrapolating the curve out to the point where @xmath34 , we derive @xmath35 ( note that this large value is the turn  around radius at @xmath7 and not the turn  around radius of the shells presently located near the virial radius ) .",
    "we use this @xmath33 , and fit for the amplitude of the gas density distribution in this direction using equation 2.15 of @xcite ( dashed curve ) .",
    "we obtain good fits for both the radial velocity and density profiles , thus we conclude that , in the undisturbed pre - shock ( infall ) regions , both distributions are consistent with the functional forms derived by @xcite . note , that the radial velocity is not zero within the virial radius due to internal flows . in this direction , we can identify a virial shock at 1.8@xmath1 ; at this radius , we see a large peak in the convergence associated with a significant decrease in pressure with radius , and the radial velocity of the gas falling toward the cluster center drops to zero .",
    "the peak in the convergence at 0.35@xmath1  is due to an internal flow shock .",
    "we see no other accretion shock , therefore , in this direction , the virial shock is also an external shock .",
    "the density , temperature , and pressure drop significantly between 34  @xmath1 , well into the free collapse region , breaking the self - similarity .",
    "this drop is not due to a shock , since the radial velocity is continuous , still consistent with the self - similar solution , and there is no peak in the convergence .",
    "rather , this feature is due to voids between massive clusters of galaxies ; the infall toward our cluster simply runs out of gas .",
    "pixel b in the middle panels of figure  [ f : fig2 ] shows a representative line of sight with two accretion shocks .",
    "most lines of sight toward low  density no  filament regions ( 8090% ) have two or more accretion shocks .",
    "the dashed curves on the density and radial velocity plots toward this region show the self - similar collapse solutions of @xcite with parameters fixed at their values derived from the profiles toward pixel a. in this direction , the viral shock is located at 1.1@xmath1 , where there is a peak in the convergence , a drop in the pressure , and the radial infall is halted . outside of the virial radius , the density profile does not deviate significantly from that predicted by the self ",
    "similar solution of bertschinger .",
    "the radial velocity profile is close to the self ",
    "similar solution in the free infall region . at 2.5@xmath1",
    "the velocity of the infall becomes smaller than that of the free fall , there is a peak in the convergence , and a large jump in the pressure : this is the radius where the external shock is located in this direction .",
    "an internal flow shock due to an outward bulk flow is located at 0.5@xmath1 , where we see a small peak in the convergence , and a drop in the pressure .",
    "pixel @xmath26 in the right panel of figure  [ f : fig2 ] shows a representative sight - line toward a direction where accretion occurs along a filament , and where the infalling gas forms a shock inside the virial radius ( in this case at 0.8@xmath1 ) .",
    "we see multiple peaks in the convergence in this direction .",
    "density and temperature bumps can be seen at the location of collapsed objects falling toward the cluster along the filaments .",
    "the dashed curves on the density and radial velocity plots toward this region show the self - similar collapse solutions with parameters fixed as before .",
    "the density is much larger than that predicted by the self similar collapse model ( the property we use to identify filaments ) .",
    "as expected , the self ",
    "similar solutions of bertschinger are not good descriptions of the collapse in this direction that includes a filament .",
    "since we expect more coherent accretion shocks to occur in the low - density diffuse gas ( in regions where the infall is not disturbed by overdense filaments or sheets along the infall path ) , we identify and remove pixels in the directions of filaments . note that because filaments bend and become more radial near the virial radius , and because they miss the cluster center , the projected surface area ( number of pixels ) of filaments as viewed from the cluster center will be larger than the area actually covered by filaments at a fixed distance ( which is usually around one - third of total surface area ; see below ) .",
    "it is well known that the morphology of the density distribution in cosmological simulations depends on the density threshold chosen : high density thresholds results in a set of collapsed halos ; at lower density thresholds filamentary structures emerge , and at even lower density thresholds we see a network of sheets .",
    "colberg , krughoff & connolly ( 2005 ) identified and classified filaments in @xmath0cdm  cosmological numerical simulations using the dark matter density distribution between clusters of galaxies . in order to identify filaments ,",
    "we visually inspect the gas density distribution around each cluster and choose the gas density threshold that results in a filamentary structure ( typically 1 - 1.5 @xmath27 ) .",
    "while this threshold changes with distance from the cluster center , we verified that varying it within reasonable bounds ( a factor of 5 ) does not affect our results .",
    "we illustrate the results of this selection for the relaxed cluster amrcl9 in figure  [ f : fig3 ] ( other relaxed clusters show very similar characteristics ) .",
    "the figure shows spherically averaged profiles , along radial sight  lines that either explicitly avoid or explicitly include filaments . from top to bottom , we plot profiles of the density , temperature , pressure , radial velocity , and convergence as a function of radius ( we use the same units as in figure  [ f : fig2 ] ) we show mean values over all directions ( pixels ) with error bars which represent the dispersion due to spherical averaging ( left panel ) , and mean values of physical quantities toward filaments ( thick solid curves ) , no  filaments regions ( long dashed curves ) , and in all directions ( thin solid curves ) for reference ( right panel ) .",
    "the upper and lower error bars are calculated as standard deviations for data points that are larger and smaller than the mean .",
    "the average universal baryon background density , @xmath10 , is plotted as a dot - dashed line .",
    "the curve representing the density distributions for filaments and no  filament regions splits at about 1.2@xmath1 , where the radial velocity , @xmath32 , reaches zero ; this is , on average , the location of the innermost accretion shock , the `` virial '' shock , in this cluster .",
    "the large dispersion in the density , temperature , and thus in the pressure data greater than the mean ( upper error bars ) outside of the virial shock is caused by clumps and collapsed halos falling toward the cluster center along filaments .",
    "the density is much lower in the no  filament regions , and the spherically averaged density over all directions is very bumpy in @xmath18 due to clumps in the filaments .",
    "however , the spherically averaged density distribution in the low - density diffuse gas is smooth out to large radii , and slowly drops to the background level at about 4@xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that , outside of the virial radius , spherical averaging is not a good approximation for the distribution of baryons .",
    "the radial velocity average toward filaments reaches zero at about 0.6@xmath1 , much closer to the cluster center than the virial radius .",
    "we expect coherent accretion shocks primarily in gas that falls nearly radially , unaffected by filaments and sheets . therefore , as a second ( and last ) step in locating such coherent accretion shocks , among the regions we identified as non  filamentary based on their density ( in our first step )",
    ", we further select pixels where the infalling gas velocity is nearly radial ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this second step assures us that we isolate truly infalling low - density regions , as opposed to low - density regions that might be disturbed by incoherent , non - radial motions . in practice",
    ", we found that non  radial accretion shocks in the non  filamentary regions are rare , and this second step provides only a small correction .",
    "this is reassuring , since it may be difficult to disentangle radial and non  radial shocks in observations .",
    "the determination of mach numbers for shocks in numerical simulations in general is not a trivial task ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since we found the gas velocities through the accretion shocks in the non  filamentary directions to be close to radial , we assume that the shock surface is tangential to the radial direction . at any fixed direction ( pixel number ) , we use the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions to determine the upstream mach number from the pressure ratio taken from the simulations : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the upstream ( pre - shock ) and downstream ( post - shock ) pressures at the position of the shock , and @xmath40 .",
    "although we assume radial shocks , our method still gives a good approximation for the mach numbers of shocks as long as the shock surface is not in the radial direction ( the number of pixels with the shock surface close to radial is indeed negligible ) .",
    "we next describe the properties of the shocks we identified around the amr clusters . as will become clear below , there are two distinct sets of accretion shocks , which can be distinguished by their mach numbers , and also by their radial location .",
    "we first discuss the `` virial '' shocks , which are located closer in , and have low mach numbers .",
    "we then discuss the `` external '' shocks , which are located farther out , with large mach numbers , and where infalling gas is shocked for the first time .",
    "we fit gaussian functions to the peaks of the convergence profile for the sight  lines in no  filament directions ( excluding the few pixels with non  radial infall ) .",
    "we determine the position of the virial shock as the radial position of the shock near the virial radius toward no  filament regions , where the radial infall is halted ( the radial velocity drops to zero the first time moving toward the cluster center ) .",
    "we illustrate our results for amr clusters using the relaxed cluster amrcl5 , but other relaxed clusters show similar features . in figures",

    "first , we remove shocks in filaments using the method we described in section  [ ss : amrshocks ] .",

    "we use 768 healpix  pixels to represent our sph cluster data . with this choice the healpix  pixel sizes as a function of radius track the resolution of the simulations well ( within a factor of two ; compare the dashed curve with error bars and the straight dashed line in figure  [ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "we apply the same visual method to identify relaxed clusters as in the amr case above (  [ ss : amrshocks ] ) .",
    "we find four relaxed clusters in our sph sample .    in sph simulations ,",
    "lagrangian particles are used as interpolation points to produce a continuum representation of the gas . given a compact distribution function @xmath67 ,",
    "also called a `` smoothing kernel '' ( usually similar to a gaussian distribution ) , a physical quantity , @xmath31 , can be expressed at an arbitrary position @xmath68 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the local mass density , position , mass and smoothing length , respectively , associated with particle @xmath61 , and the summation is over all particles .",
    "similarly to our method used to locate shocks in the amr cluster sample , we locate shocks in our sph clusters using the convergence , @xmath74 .",
    "however , the discreteness of the sph particles and the unstructured nature of their distribution can make regions of strong shear ( large @xmath75 ) appear as regions of compression .",
    "therefore we used the shear correction factor of balsara ( 1995 ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a small arbitrary constant used to prevent division by zero , @xmath78 is the local sound speed , and @xmath79 is the scale width of the smoothing kernel .",
    "the factor @xmath46 is near unity where there is no shear , and near zero where the shear is large relative to the compression .",
    "thus , shocks should only appear in regions where the corrected convergence , @xmath80 has large values .",
    "we also looked at the derivative of the internal energy generated by the artificial viscosity ( av ) , @xmath81 . in order to prevent the unphysical `` post - shock oscillations '' and particle inter - penetration , sph codes typically employ av to mimic energy dissipation and smooth the thermal energy distribution behind a shock front .",
    "these algorithms are designed to convert kinetic energy into thermal energy only around regions of compression , and av is large only where shocks appear .",
    "we use the tillamook  sph code ( hearn 2002 ) to reconstruct the av energy derivatives for our sph cluster data .",
    "the tillamook  code is an extensible , parallel program written in c++ , which provides the user with significant flexibility in the simulation components used , including artificial viscosity .",
    "here , we employ the av algorithm of balsara ( 1995 ) , and express the contribution of av to the thermal energy derivative as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the pressure , @xmath84 is the mass density , and @xmath6 and @xmath85 are the viscosity parameters .",
    "the factor @xmath86 is similar to a velocity divergence ; the contribution of particle @xmath62 to the viscosity of particle @xmath61 is @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the mean value of the shear correction for particles @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "[ f : fig6 ] we show the distribution of the physical parameters toward two fixed pixel directions representing no  filament and filament regions . in the no  filament regions the largest compression ( the maximum of the convergence or @xmath93 ) , located at about 3.0@xmath1 , is due to the the virial shock .",
    "however , the radial velocity , @xmath32 , becomes zero at around 2.5@xmath1 , about 0.5@xmath1closer to the cluster center .",
    "this offset is due to numerical effects in sph simulations .",
    "the infalling gas has a very low density , therefore the shock regions in it are smeared out due to the large smoothing length and artificial viscosity @xcite .",
    "we find that in the direction of filaments ( represented by pixel b ) , as we would expect , the gas plunges deep into the cluster and the radial velocity reaches zero at about 0.6@xmath1 .    in figure  [",
    "f : fig7 ] , we show spherical averages of physical parameters toward all pixel directions in sphcl4 .",
    "the left panel shows mean values over all pixel directions with error bars ( the error bars represent the dispersion due to spherical averaging calculated as for figure  [ f : fig3 ] left panel ) , while the right panel shows averages toward filaments ( thick solid curves ) , no  filaments ( dashed curves ) and , for reference , toward all directions ( thin solid curves ) . from top to bottom , we plot profiles of the gas density , temperature , pressure , radial velocity , convergence ( units are the same as in figure  [ f : fig2 ] ) and `` compression '' @xmath93 ( in arbitrary units , normalized to its maximum value ) , as a function of distance from the cluster center in units of @xmath1 .",
    "the large dispersion on the gas density at large radii of this relaxed cluster is due to clumps falling into the cluster via filaments , and show that the spherically averaged density is not a good approximation far from the cluster center .",
    "the large dispersion between 1@xmath1  and 3@xmath1  is due to the fact that the shock location is a function of direction from cluster center ( most visible in the temperature and the @xmath93 plots ) .",
    "the temperature floor at about 2 kev is due to the 2 kev preheating assigned to every particle according to the preheating scheme .    from the distribution of the gas radial velocity , @xmath32 , ( right panel of figure  [",
    "f : fig7 ] ) , we can see that along the no  filament directions , the gas infall slows down at about 3@xmath1 , reaching zero velocity at about 2.1@xmath1 , whereas in directions toward filaments , the gas plunges into the cluster to about @xmath94 .",
    "the density distribution in the no  filament regions ( dashed line ) drops below the average density ( solid line ) at around 2.1@xmath1 . based on our simulations",
    ", this should be the position of the virial shock in this cluster .",
    "the position of the maximum of the convergence and @xmath93 ( last two figures on the right panel ) is at about 2.7@xmath1 .",
    "this shows that the maximum compression happens at about 0.6@xmath1  farther from the cluster center than where the virial shock position should be based on the density and velocity distributions .",
    "this is due to the large smoothing length ( about 1 mpc at this distance ) and the artificial viscosity .",
    "since the density is very low in the pre - shock regions , the large smoothing length and the artificial viscosity make it difficult to estimate the pre - shock values of density , temperature , radial velocity , at the shock reliably , therefore we omit the analysis of mach numbers for our sph cluster sample .",
    "the method we apply to locate virial shocks in our sph sample is similar to that applied in the amr sample .",
    "we use the convergence maximum and the radial velocity to identify the position of the virial shocks to be consistent with our analysis of the amr simulations .",
    "we illustrate our sph results on one relaxed cluster , sphcl4 , but other relaxed clusters show similar characteristics . in figure",
    "[ f : fig8 ] , we show the radial distribution of virial shocks toward different pixels expressed as a percentage of surface area covered by shocks ( number of pixels with shocks over total number of pixels ) . the distribution peaks at about 2.7@xmath1  with a width of 1@xmath1 .",
    "the 2d angular distribution of the virial shocks in sphcl4 is shown in figure  [ f : fig9 ] .",
    "the characteristic positions , @xmath95 , and the fractional areas covered by virial shocks , @xmath50 , for clusters in our sph sample are listed in table 2 ( columns @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the positions of the virial shocks in most preheated sph clusters fall between 2@xmath1  and 3@xmath1 . in relaxed clusters ,",
    "the virial shocks cover a fraction 3656% of the total @xmath96 solid angle .",
    "unlike in the amr case , in the no  filament directions , the sph clusters always show only a single accretion shock in each line of sight .",
    "since there is no sign of a shock farther out , and the kinetic energy from radial infall is being converted to thermal energy by these shocks , we refer to these as virial shocks .    however , at about 3@xmath1 , which is where we would expect to find the external shocks in our amr simulations , the pre - shock gas in the sph simulations experiences strong numerical smoothing ( as already emphasized in @xcite ) .",
    "the smoothing length at these large distances is greater than 1 mpc , thus even if external shocks were formed at these locations , the sph simulations could not resolve it .",
    "therefore we do not analyze external shocks in our sph cluster sample .",
    "the primary motivation in this paper for studying accretion shocks  besides characterizing their basic properties  is to assess whether they could be detectable by _ alma _  through the sz effect .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the advantage of sz observations is that the sz surface brightness is proportional to the gas density ( rather than its square , such as the x  ray flux ) , and therefore drops considerably less rapidly with radius . using spherically symmetric models for the cluster gas and temperature profiles ,",
    "@xcite calculated the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath97 ) for detecting shocks near the virial radius of clusters , using the high spatial resolution ( @xmath98 ) , high sensitivity ( @xmath99k , with a day of integration ) next generation interferometer , _ alma_. they defined the @xmath97 ratio as the difference in the predicted surface brightness near the location of the shock , in the presence and absence of a strong discontinuity in gas pressure , divided by the instrumental noise .",

    "for the sake of completeness , we briefly recapitulate the pertinent aspects of the @xcite model , including their calculation of the sz surface brightness",
    ". the interested reader should consult their work for more details .",
    "the sz surface brightness at the impact parameter @xmath101 relative to the center of a cluster with a given mass @xmath21  and redshift @xmath102 is expressed as @xmath103 where @xmath101 is the dimensionless distance from the cluster s center at the closest approach for a given sightline ( in units of the virial radius ) , and @xmath104 is a constant normalization , @xmath105 here , the frequency dependence is given by @xmath106 ( e.g. birkinshaw 1999 ) , where the dimensionless frequency is @xmath107 ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the planck and boltzmann constants ; relativistic corrections are ignored since they are negligible for _ alma _  observations at @xmath110 ghz of clusters with @xmath111 kev ) ; @xmath112 is the temperature of the cmb today ; @xmath113 is the concentration parameter for the nfw halo profile ; @xmath114 is a normalization constant for the gas density , determined by the universal baryon fraction ; and @xmath115 is a normalization constant for the mass  temperature relation . assuming a polytropic equation of state @xmath116 , and also that the gas density profile tracks that of the dark matter at large radii , determines the polytropic index , @xmath5 , and the normalization , @xmath115 ( komatsu & seljak 2001 ) .",
    "the shape of the surface brightness profile is contained in @xmath117 where the integral is performed along the line of sight @xmath118 ; @xmath119 is the dimensionless radial coordinate ( we use @xmath1  as a unit for distance , thus @xmath120 ) ; @xmath121 , where @xmath122  is the assumed radial position of the virial shock with a width of @xmath123 , @xmath124 is the solution of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium with a polytropic gas model ( komatsu & seljak 2001 ) , and @xmath125 is a linear cut  off function that allows for the edge of the cluster",
    "to be `` blurred '' , mimicking shocks that are spread over a finite distance :    @xmath126    @xcite used the above model to compute the difference @xmath127 in surface brightness profiles for pairs of clusters , one with no edge ( @xmath128 ) , and another cluster that was identical , except that it has an edge near the virial radius ( @xmath129 ) . by comparing @xmath130 to the noise expected from _ alma _ , they showed that , in theory , virial shocks should be detectable with high significance .",
    "we find that the positions of virial shocks in our simulated amr clusters fall in the distance interval of 0.9 - 1.4@xmath1  ( see table  [ t : table1 ] ) . here",
    "we focus on these virial shocks , rather than any external shocks , because the sz surface brightness at @xmath131 is likely to be too low to yield a detection of any external shocks . from figure",
    "[ f : fig4 ] we can see that over different directions , the radial position of the virial shocks varies by about @xmath132 .",
    "the effective width @xmath133 of these shocks ( which do not include the directions along filaments ) will be narrower , since the 2d projected sz surface brightness in a given direction on the sky depends only on a small fraction of the entire 4@xmath134 steradian solid angle around the cluster .",
    "virial shocks cover about 40% of the total surface area of clusters ( see table  [ t : table1 ] ) , rather than the 100% coverage assumed by @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the 2d projection of the surface area covered by virial shocks can change substantially , depending on the viewing angle relative to the active filament plane of the cluster . here",
    "`` active filament plane '' refers to the plane crossing the cluster center that contains most of the filaments around the cluster .",
    "the orientation of this plane can be determined unambiguously by visual inspection in almost all clusters in our sample , and we expect that this plane can indeed be identified in most relaxed massive clusters ( but our sample of relaxed clusters is not large enough to verify this ) .",
    "for example , 50% of the 2@xmath134 azimuth angle measured from the cluster center is covered by virial shocks in the xz - projection of amrcl5 ( figure  [ f : fig10]a ; area within dot - dashed lines ) whereas this fraction is only 10% in the yz - projection of amrcl7 ( figure  [ f : fig11]a ; area within dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the regions contaminated by filaments in these 2d images were identified via visual inspection .",
    "since the majority of filaments around rich clusters of galaxies are located in the active filament plane of the cluster , the contamination by filaments can be minimized quite effectively by choosing clusters that we happen to observe `` edge on '' , i.e. we are located in the active filament plane .",
    "filaments might be identifiable using galaxy redshift information ( see pimbblet , drinkwater & hawkrigg 2004 ) , which would help in picking the most promising clusters for observations with _ alma_.    we next use two massive clusters , amrcl5 and amrcl7 , to make explicit comparisons to the spherical model predictions in @xcite , and to illustrate some issues related to observing virial shocks based on their sz signature ( figures  [ f : fig10 ] and [ f : fig11 ] ) .",
    "relaxed cluster amrcl5 has a total mass of @xmath135 , and amrcl7 , a merging cluster , has a mass of @xmath136 ( see table  [ t : table1 ] ) .",
    "we first calculate the 2d sz surface brightness distribution from our simulation data , integrating along the line of sight ( @xmath118 ) over the extent of the cluster along the line of sight ( from @xmath137 to @xmath138 ) using    @xmath139    here @xmath140 are spatial coordinates in the plane of the sky , i.e. perpendicular to the line  of  sight coordinate @xmath118 ; @xmath141 is the electron density , where @xmath142 is the mean molecular weight per electron and @xmath143 is the proton mass ; @xmath144 is the gas density ; @xmath145 is the gas mass fraction ( we adopt @xmath146 ) , and we use the standard assumption that the electron temperature equals the gas temperature , @xmath147 ( similar expressions were used for the xz and yz projections ) . in practice , we pixelize @xmath148 and @xmath118 , and approximate the integral with a sum over the line of sight from @xmath149 mpc to @xmath150 mpc .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath97 ratio is the lowest for clusters at a redshift of @xmath151 , thus we generated images of clusters assuming they are located at this redshift .",
    "this choice makes our @xmath97 ratio estimates conservative .",
    "we first examine the xz projection of amrcl5 , which , as mentioned above , is close to an edge on projection , and therefore has the least amount of contamination from filaments ( figure  [ f : fig10 ] ) . in this projection , the line of filaments is stretching from the upper left corner to the lower right corner of the image ( as revealed by the shape of the contours in figure  [ f : fig10]a ) .",
    "we find that other views of even relaxed clusters are often much more contaminated by filaments .",
    "the azimuthally averaged sz surface brightness profile , excluding the angles contaminated by filaments ( i.e. the area within the dot - dashed lines , containing @xmath250% of the 2@xmath134 azimuth angles from the cluster center ) is shown in figure  [ f : fig10]a . in this figure ,",
    "the error bars represent the dispersion ( standard deviation ) due to azimuthal averaging at each radius ( instrument noise and contamination from other astrophysical effects are not included ) .    in figure",
    "[ f : fig10]b , we see that the virial shock appears to leave a relatively sharp feature in the average sz profile , i.e. a sharp drop near @xmath1 with a width of @xmath2 0.1@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , there is a distinct break in the slope of the surface brightness profile at @xmath20.6@xmath1 .",
    "this break is not caused by the change in the slope of the nfw density profile , since it is not present in the spherical models .",
    "we suspect it is caused by the breaking of the self similarity of the pressure profiles due to the finite entropy of the cluster gas . as a consequence ,",
    "the spherical models discussed above , shown by the dotted and dot  dashed curves in figure  [ f : fig10]b ( with and without an edge , respectively ) , do not fit the simulated sz profiles over the whole region inside the virial shocks .    to quantify the significance at which the presence of the virial shock can be detected ,",
    "we fit a power  law model to the sz surface brightness profile near the virial shock , as might be done to an actual observation ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the difference between the simulated sz profile and the power  law model ( @xmath152 , @xmath6 = 2.45 ) with no cut  off , @xmath153 , is shown in figure  [ f : fig10]c .",

    "figure 2 of kocsis et al . 2005 ) . for the cluster with an edge , we chose the position and width of the virial shock to be similar to those of our simulated cluster ( @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) .",
    "the central sz decrement of our simulated cluster is @xmath156k .",
    "the difference in the sz decrement of our simulated cluster , compared to the power ",
    "law extrapolation , is about @xmath157k within a 0.2@xmath1  wide annulus around the 1@xmath1  ( evaluated in the no  filament regions ) .",

    "the central sz decrement for this cluster in this projection is @xmath164k .",
    "this cluster also shows a sharp drop in the surface brightness profile near @xmath1 and also a discernible break in the slope at around 0.4@xmath1 , somewhat closer to the cluster center than the break in amrcl5 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath168 for the detection of the virial shock in this cluster .",

    "there are two reasons for this reduction : ( i ) the simulations show a generally steeper sz profile , especially at radii beyond 0.5 @xmath1 ; and ( ii ) only a fraction ( 10 - 50% in our two cases ) of the 2@xmath134azimuthal angle around the cluster s perimeter is covered by virial shocks near @xmath1  in our simulated clusters .",
    "the second of these effects is simply caused by the smearing of the shocks in the 2d projection of the three  dimensional , non - spherical features , over a significant fraction of the cluster s perimeter .",
    "the first effect is attributable to two factors .",
    "first , we find that the concentration parameter for our massive relaxed clusters is about @xmath172 , much larger than the value @xmath173 adopted by kocsis et al .",
    "second , the drop in the surface density profile might be related to the excess entropy in the core of the cluster .",
    "( the slope of the sz profile could thus plausibly provide information on the entropy structure of clusters ; a break in its slope may be verified by _ alma _  relatively easily , since the sz decrement is much larger at around 0.5 @xmath1  than at the virial radius . ) finally , we note that the toy model used in kocsis et al . adopted a somewhat different outer boundary condition than was used in the original work of komatsu & seljak ( 2001 ) , on which the kocsis et al .",
    "toy models are based . in particular , while komatsu & seljak require the _ slope _ of the gas profile to match that of the dm halo at the virial radius , kocsis et al .",
    "require the baryon / dm mass ratio interior to a large radius ( = 200 @xmath174 ) to equal the universal mean @xmath175 . as a result , the sz profile in the kocsis et al .",
    "toy model is significantly flatter near the virial radius than that of the komatsu & seljak toy model ( e.g. the drop in the surface brightness profile from the cluster core to the virial radius , predicted in figure 1 in kocsis et al . , is a factor of @xmath176 , which is about a factor of @xmath177 smaller than the factor of @xmath178 drop predicted for the same cluster parameters in the upper left panel in figure 15 in komatsu & seljak ) .",
    "our simplified treatment suggests that even if we do not select clusters optimally ( to minimize contamination by filaments ) , _ alma_may still be able to detect virial shocks with mosaic observations covering a significant portion of the annulus near @xmath1  for a suitably bright cluster .",
    "if in real clusters the surface brightness drops below 10@xmath86k around the virial radius and @xmath130 is only about 2 - 3@xmath165k , then the detection of virial shocks will become much more difficult , due to contamination from secondary effects in the cmb at the @xmath86k level from unrelated background or foreground galaxy clusters , dust emission , and point source contamination .",
    "additional secondary effects which can be important at around @xmath1  may be generated by clusters of galaxies via gravitational lensing , and by the thermal sz effect from unresolved clusters .",
    "a bipolar pattern with an amplitude of a few @xmath86k is produced by clusters when they lens cmb fluctuations with a large  scale gradient @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is generated by the so  called moving cluster effect @xcite , but the amplitude of this effect at the virial radius is most likely below @xmath179k @xcite .",
    "the theoretical sensitivity of interferometers is also reduced for large ",
    "scale smooth surface density distributions , therefore we may have overestimated the @xmath97 ratio . on the other hand , using nonlinear de - convolution , much larger scale structures can be recovered from mosaic observations than an analytical treatment would suggest @xcite .",
    "a redshift of 0.3 was used to obtain a conservative estimate of the @xmath97 ratio ; we expect a significant increase in @xmath97 if the redshift of the clusters were selected optimally . an improved estimate for the significance of detecting virial shocks in clusters of galaxies can be done using simulated mock _ alma _  observations and analyzing the simulated visibilities with software packages used to analyze real data ( e.g. _ miriad _ , _ aips _ ) .",

    "a comparison of our results to those based on other cosmological simulations is difficult , because we focus here on the high  resolution details of accretion shocks around individual , massive clusters , whereas other studies focused on deriving global properties , using a much larger simulation volume at lower resolution .",
    "nevertheless , we find that external shocks around massive clusters of galaxies form at about 3@xmath1  ( @xmath181 ) , with large mach numbers , extending to values as high as @xmath182 .",
    "studies based on other simulations also found very high mach numbers for external shocks @xcite . taking into account the photo - heating of the pre - shocked gas , @xcite found that the mach numbers of external shocks are less than a few hundred .",
    "based on the self - similar solution of @xcite , scaled to our amr simulations , we estimate that external shocks at about 3@xmath1  from the centers of massive clusters of galaxies should have mach numbers of @xmath183 depending on the actual distance of the shock from cluster center .",
    "quantitative comparisons between our results for the amr and sph cluster samples are hindered by the fact that the amr simulations were adiabatic , whereas the sph simulations assumed that the gas was pre  heated .",
    "the two simulations also used different cosmological parameters : @xmath11=0.92 ( amr ) versus 1.0 ( sph ) , and @xmath10=0.047 ( amr ) versus 0.03 ( sph ) .",
    "overall , we find that the position of the virial shocks are much farther out in our sph simulations ( located at about 2 - 3@xmath1 ) than in the amr simulations ( @xmath184@xmath1 ) ; this is in spite of the fact that the sph clusters have a lower baryon fraction .",
    "this difference is probably not due to preheating : high  resolution amr simulations of clusters of galaxies with and without preheating show no noticeable difference in the radial positions of the virial shocks ( see figure 1 of younger & bryan 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , we attribute the large difference in the radial position of the virial shocks between our amr and sph simulations to the artificial viscosity and large smoothing length far from the cluster center .",
    "( we note that the problem may be indirectly exacerbated by the presence of pre  heating , which keeps gas densities lower , and the smoothing length larger ) .",
    "however , we expect the other features of virial shocks ( such as the covering area and mass ratios ) in our sph simulations to be reliable .",
    "indeed , these quantities agree with those we found in the amr cluster sample .    a comparison of the amount of mass locked up in filaments versus mass in no  filament regions is also of interest , because it tells us roughly how much mass will be accreted via filaments in the form of dense clumps , collapsed halos and gas collapsed into filaments versus via accretion of low  density diffuse gas .",
    "we determined this mass ratio in regions outside of the smoothed virial radius and thus should be free from the numerical problems mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "we show the total mass in filaments as a percentage of the total mass for all clusters in our amr and sph cluster sample in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "about 80% to 90% of the mass resides in the filaments falling toward the cluster centers both in our amr and sph sample .",
    "the slightly larger percentage of mass in filaments in our sph simulations is most likely due to the higher value of @xmath11 used in those simulations .",
    "based on our simulations , we conclude that massive clusters of galaxies accrete most of their mass via filaments , rather than via low  density diffuse gas , even at the later stages of their evolution .",
    "we have studied large - scale accretion shocks in a sample of massive ( @xmath185 ) galaxy clusters at redshift @xmath7 drawn from amr and sph cosmological @xmath0cdm  simulations .",
    "the properties of shocks in clusters with a larger range of masses and redshifts will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "most of our quantitative results are based on the cluster sample drawn from our amr simulations , which did not take feedback ( heating , cooling , star ",
    "formation , and supernovae ) into account .",
    "however , the properties of the shocks we derived from these simulations agree with those in an independent set of sph simulations , with the exception of the radial location of the virial shocks ( which are found to be farther out in the sph runs , due to numerical effects ) .    the main results of this study can be summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) clusters are surrounded by two distinct sets of accretion shocks , located near @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "( 2 ) these shocks cover @xmath188 of the surface area around each cluster . ( 3 ) the shocks near @xmath186 cause a sharp drop in the projected sz surface brightness , tracing out a circular arc in projection over a non  negligible fraction ( 1050% ; depending strongly on both the dynamical state of the cluster , and on the viewing angle ) of the 2@xmath134 azimuthal angle around the cluster center .",
    "( 4 ) the significance of the sz feature due to these shocks is reduced by a factor of 5 - 10 relative to earlier predictions based on spherical models @xcite , because of the partial extent of the sharp arc , and because the simulations predict steeper sz surface brightness profiles .",
    "nevertheless , the features may be detectable with dedicated mosaic observations , by the next generation high angular resolution and sensitivity radio interferometer , _",
    "our results should motivate a more detailed follow ",
    "up study of the effects of non - spherical accretion , astrophysical and instrumental noise , and image processing techniques on the detectability of virial shocks in massive clusters of galaxies using realistic mock _ alma_observations of clusters drawn from high  resolution cosmological simulations .",
    "such studies will be necessary for a more robust estimate of the feasibility of the detection of these shocks , as well as to find the optimal redshift for the observations , and to determine the best target selection method and observation strategy .",
