    "similarly , nuclear shadowing is due to the recombination of partons from different nucleons , if viewed in the infinite momentum frame  @xcite . in the target frame",
    ", it arises from non - additive contributions of the rescattering of the hadronic @xmath15-fock states in a spatially extended medium  @xcite .",
    "the descriptions in different lorentz frames are equivalent , of course . but depending on the physical problem at hand , a well - chosen lorentz frame may provide a particularly simple partonic interpretation . to study the nuclear dependence of physical processes , the target rest frame provides arguably the most intuitive picture .",
    "qcd factorization theorems can be expected to hold for the nuclear dependence of high-@xmath16 processes only  @xcite , and thus a large variety of other approaches to the nuclear dependence of hard processes exists in the literature  @xcite .",
    "these exploit that in the target rest frame , the nuclear dependence of a physical process @xmath17 with transition amplitude @xmath18 can be attributed often to the multiple rescattering of the hard in- and outgoing partons inside the soft spatially extended target colour field . in the simplest cases ,",
    "this rescattering effect can be described by multiplying the free in- and outgoing wavefunctions with straight eikonal wilson lines which account for the leading medium - induced colour rotation of projectile quarks  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we derive and study a more refined approximation scheme for in- and outgoing wavefunctions @xmath19 and @xmath20 which includes the leading transverse dynamical evolution of the projectile partons inside the target . to this end , we derive in section  [ sec2 ] explicit expressions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 which approximate to leading order @xmath21 in the norm _ and _ next to leading order in the phase the solution of the dirac equation in the presence of a spatially extended colour field .",
    "the @xmath21-corrections included in these solutions are known to provide the leading contribution for observables which are essentially determined by the destructive interference between different production amplitudes as , e.g. , the non - abelian landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect  @xcite or the nuclear dependence of drell - yan pair production  @xcite .",
    "indeed , our derivation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 draws on exactly the same approximation schemes which were used in recent studies  @xcite of the nuclear dependence of these observables . in section  [ sec2 ] , however , we discuss this rescattering effect without reference to a particular observable . in this way , we obtain a compact expression which turns out to be the non - abelian generalization of the abelian furry approximation  @xcite and which may serve as building block in the calculation of very different nuclear dependencies .",
    "the main technical complication in working with non - abelian furry wavefunctions is that they involve a path - integral over a path - ordered non - abelian wilson line . in section  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we show for the example of the @xmath22 photodissociation process how explicit and exact calculations can be done despite this complication .",
    "the key step is a diagrammatic technique first used by mueller and collaborators  @xcite which allows to establish the colour triviality of certain cross sections involving @xmath2-fold rescattering processes . here",
    ", colour triviality means that the contribution to a medium - dependent observable to @xmath2-th order in the opacity involves only colour traces which reduce to the @xmath2-th power of the casimir .",

    ", we derive the corresponding diagrammatic identities for our configuration space formulation of partonic rescattering .",
    "we then use these identities in explicit proofs of the colour triviality of the inelastic and diffractive part of the inclusive and one - fold differential ( i.e. one jet resolved ) photoabsorption cross section . at least for the @xmath22 photodissociation cross section ,",
    "all colour trivial observables turn out to be given in terms of the transverse dynamical evolution of a qcd dipole which is described by a simple path integral @xmath23 .",
    "we discuss the eikonal limit in which the transverse dynamical evolution is neglected , and we quantify the leading corrections to this limiting case .",
    "we choose for all explicit calculations the photodissociation process @xmath22 mainly since it is the simplest example which allows to illustrate the main technical difficulties associated with the non - abelian furry approximation and colour interference effects .",
    "the @xmath22 process is a quantitatively significant contribution to the nuclear structure function @xmath4 , but phenomenological applications require the inclusion of processes with initial gluon radiation ( e.g. @xmath24 ) .",
    "these are known to contribute in the aligned jet region , where the transverse @xmath1 separation is large , to leading order in @xmath25 .",
    "discussion of these radiative contributions involves the quark - gluon vertex and complicates the analysis of colour interference effects significantly .",
    "this lies beyond the scope of a first illustration of the non - abelian furry approximation , given here .",
    "we shall address the corresponding additional technical problems in a subsequent work where we study colour interference in the non - abelian lpm - effect . in the present paper",
    ", we discuss only two aspects of the very general question to what extent our approach can be applied to other or more exclusive observables or to other models of the medium : first , we give in section  [ sec4b ] and  [ sec4e ] examples of ( more exclusive ) photoabsorption processes which are not colour trivial , thus indicating the limitations of the approach advocated here .",

    "earlier applications of these diagrammatic techniques as well as statements about the colour triviality of the photoabsorption cross section exist  @xcite . here , we have given relatively short and complete proofs of these statements by exploiting the advantages of a new and compact configuration - space notation implied by the furry wavefunction .",
