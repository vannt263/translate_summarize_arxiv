    "since snell discovered an outflow from a protostar in 1980 @xcite , over 300 outflows have been found in many star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "recently , outflows from brown dwarf @xcite and o - type stars @xcite were discovered .",
    "these observations indicate that outflow is ubiquitous in the star formation process . observations also show that outflows have two or more distinct velocity components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , an outflow is composed of a low - velocity component ( lvc ) with 10 - 50@xmath7 and a high - velocity component ( hvc ) with @xmath6@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "outflows have a collimation factor ( i.e. , length / width or major / minor radius of the outflow ) of @xmath11 to @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the height and radius of the outflow , respectively .",
    "there is a clear trend toward higher collimation at higher outflow velocity @xcite . since outflows have various morphological and kinematical properties ,",
    "they can not be explained by a single - class model .",
    "the flows that originated from the protostar are typically classified into two types : molecular outflow ( hereafter , outflow ) observed mainly with co molecules , and optical jet ( hereafter jet ) observed by optical emission @xcite .",
    "outflows observed by co line emission exhibit a wide opening angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and slow velocity ( @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "jets observed by optical emission , however , exhibit good collimation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and high velocity ( @xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations indicate that around each protostar , high - speed jets with a narrow opening angle are enclosed by a low - velocity outflow with a wide opening angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    what mechanism drives the outflow and the jet in the star formation process ?",
    "during star formation , neither radiation nor thermal pressure from the protostar can supply sufficient kinetic energy and momentum for driving the jet and the outflow @xcite .",
    "these flows ( outflows and jets ) are considered to be driven by release of the gravitational energy mediated by the lorentz and centrifugal forces ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we have not understood what drives these flows during star formation .",
    "it is difficult to directly observe the driving points of the outflow and the jet , because they are embedded in the dense cloud at several au from the protostar .",
    "furthermore , we can not analytically investigate the driving mechanisms of the jet and the outflow in detail , because they have a large spatial scale and density contrast , and these flows are influenced by closely related lorentz , centrifugal , thermal pressure gradient , and gravitational forces .",
    "therefore , numerical simulation is the most effective tool for investigating the driving mechanisms of the jet and the outflow .",
    "@xcite showed that centrifugally driven outflow from the disk is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes an angle of less than 60@xmath17 ( i.e. , the disk wind model ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that this models as the mechanism for the protostellar jet .",
    "subsequently many numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which showed that disk could drive the jet confirmed the disk - wind mechanism around the protostar ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed the x - wind model , in which the jet is driven in close proximity to the protostar .",
    "both the disk wind and the x - wind are driven magnetocenrifugally from open magnetic field lines anchored on rapidly rotating circumstellar disks .",
    "the difference between these models lies in where the field lines are anchored : near the radius of magnetospherical truncation on the disk for x - wind and over a wider range of disk radii for disk wind @xcite .",
    "the jet speeds derived from both x - wind and disk wind theories correspond to the kepler speed at their driving point on the circumstellar disk .",
    "thus , these models can not explain the two velocity components of jet and outflow .",
    "many people believe that outflow ( i.e. , slow speed and wide opening angle flow ) is entrained by the jet ( i.e. , high speed and narrow opening angle flow ) , and that the jet is driven by either the disk wind or the x - wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , almost all simulations , except for a few studies , calculate the evolution of the circumstellar disk ( i.e. , jet driving ) after the protostar grows up sufficiently , and provide the idealized boundary , density profile of the disk , distribution of the magnetic field and velocity , accretion rate , etc .",
    "after the protostar is formed , we can not judge whether these configurations are realized .",
    "therefore to acquire adequate information about the protostar and to understand the driving mechanism of the jet and the outflows , we should calculate cloud evolution from the molecular cloud that forms the protostar .",
    "simulations of cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core to stellar core formation show that the low - velocity flow is driven from the adiabatic core formed before protostar formation , and that the high - velocity flow is driven from another core . assuming spherical symmetry , the evolution from molecular cloud to stellar core has been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they determined the density , velocity , and temperature structures of the collapsing cloud and stellar core .",
    "they have shown that the adiabatic core ( or the first core ) with a radius of @xmath61au forms when the central density reaches @xmath18 , because the gas becomes optically thick and the thermal pressure increases . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the stellar core formation from the molecular cloud core using sph simulations .",
    "however , the outflow and the jet do not appear in their calculations because they ignored the magnetic effect . the evolution of the magnetized cloud until the formation of the adiabatic core ( hereafter , the first core ) was investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the outflow appears after the first core formation in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite investigated the evolution of the magnetized clouds up to protostar formation .",
    "they calculated the cloud evolution from the molecular cloud ( @xmath19 ) to protostar formation ( @xmath20 ) . in their calculations",
    ", two distinct flows appeared : low - velocity flow ( @xmath21kms@xmath22 ) driven from the first core , and high - velocity flow ( @xmath23 kms@xmath22 ) driven from the second core ( i.e. , the protostar ) .",
    "they expected that low - velocity flow would be observed as molecular outflow and high - velocity flow as an optical jet .",
    "they adopted ideal mhd approximation , which is valid in the low - density gas region ( @xmath24 ) ; however , it is not valid in the high - density gas region ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xcite found significant magnetic flux loss for @xmath26 by ohmic dissipation .",
    "therefore , @xcite and @xcite overestimated the magnetic flux of the cloud , particularly in the high - density gas region .",
    "there are two predictions concerning driving outflows and jets : one is that the outflow is entrained by the jet , and another is that the outflow and jet are driven from different objects .",
    "these predictions are mutually conflicting . in this paper , we calculate cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core ( @xmath27 , @xmath28au ) to stellar core formation ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) using three - dimensional resistive mhd nested grid method , study the formation process of jets and outflows , and show the driving mechanisms of these flows . the numerical method of our computations and our model framework are given in  2 , and the numerical results are presented in  3 .",
    "we discuss the driving mechanism of the outflow and the jet in  4 , and summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "our initial settings are almost the same as those of @xcite .",

    ", we calculated the cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core with @xmath94 to form a protostar with @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite investigated cloud evolution in the isothermal and early adiabatic phases .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field and angular velocity in the collapsing cloud for @xmath96 was shown by @xcite .",
    "therefore , this paper focuses mainly on the cloud evolution after the first core formation ( @xmath97 ) because we are interested in the driving mechanism of the outflow and the jet .",
    "we parameterized angular velocity , magnetic field strength , and the ratio of thermal to gravitational energy of the initial cloud for 80 models .",
    "cloud evolutions are typically classified into three types when the outflow or jet appears in the collapsing cloud .",
    "we also found that cloud evolution depends on the ratio of the angular velocity to the magnetic field ( @xmath98 ) , but does not depend on the ratio of thermal to gravitational energy , especially after the first core formation ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "observations indicate that molecular cloud cores have large magnetic energies and small rotational energies @xcite . in these types of clouds ,",
    "cloud evolution is sensitive to the initial angular velocity , as shown in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show only three typical models in which the initial clouds have the same magnetic field strengths and ratios of thermal to gravitational energy , but different angular velocities ( slow , moderate , and rapid rotation rate ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the cloud evolution for model sr after the first core formation .",

    "the first core at its formation epoch has a mass of @xmath102 and a radius of @xmath103au , which is equivalent to or slightly larger than that expected by one - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic calculations @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a larger first core forms in a rapidly rotating cloud because the centrifugal force suppresses the cloud collapse and the shock occurs in the earlier adiabatic phase .",
    "however , the effect of centrifugal force at the first core formation epoch is small in model sr because a slowly rotating cloud is adopted as the initial state .",
    "the magnetic effect slightly increases the mass and size of the first core , as shown in @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig:1]_a _ and _ b _ show the density and velocity distribution on @xmath104 and @xmath105 cut planes at @xmath106 .",
    "these panels indicate that the first core has a nearly spherical shape . to evaluate the core shape , we define the oblateness as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 are the major axis , minor axis , and @xmath111-axis , respectively , derived from the moment of inertia for the high - density gas of @xmath112 according to matsumoto & hanawa ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:2]_a _ shows the evolution of the oblateness as a solid line .",
    "the oblateness increases as the cloud collapses in the isothermal phase ( @xmath113 ) , and has a peak of @xmath114 ( i.e. , the ratio of the radial to vertical scale is about 10 ) at @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the central region has a disk - like structure at this epoch .",
    "since the cloud rotates slowly , the disk is formed mainly by the lorentz force .",
    "note that the magnetic energy is comparable to both the thermal and gravitational energy at the initial state ( see table  [ table : init ] ) .",
    "the oblateness oscillates around @xmath114 for @xmath116 , and then begins to decrease ( fig .",

    "the evolution of @xmath123 depends on the geometry of the collapse .",
    "this value , @xmath123 , remains constant after a thin disk forms because the magnetic field increases in proportional to the square root of the density when the disk - like cloud collapses ( @xmath124 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath123 increases in proportion to @xmath125 when the cloud collapses spherically ( for details , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , a rapid drop of @xmath123 for @xmath121 indicates the removal of the magnetic field from the center of the cloud by ohmic dissipation .",
    "@xcite showed that the magnetic field is largely removed by ohmic dissipation for @xmath126 . since the first core forms at @xmath127 in this model , the first core is composed of the gas from which the magnetic field is already removed",
    "therefore , the first core has a large plasma beta ( or weak magnetic field strength ) , as shown in figure  [ fig:1]_c_.    figures  [ fig:1]_d _ and _ e _ show the density and velocity distributions around the first core at @xmath128 ( second collapse phase ) .",

[ fig:2]_a _ ) because the anisotropic lorentz and centrifugal forces are weaker than the isotropic forces of the gravitational and thermal pressure gradient forces in this phase .",
    "the lorentz force becomes weak due to magnetic dissipation , and an initially small rotation rate produces a weaker centrifugal force .",
    "figure  [ fig:2]_d _ shows the angular velocity normalized by the free - fall timescale at the center of the cloud , whose value corresponds to the ratio of the rotational to gravitational energy @xcite .",
    "when this value reaches @xmath131 , the rotational energy becomes comparable to the gravitational energy , and cloud rotation begins to affect cloud evolution @xcite . in model sr ,",
    "the effect of cloud rotation is significantly small in the second collapse phase ( @xmath132 ) because @xmath133 .",
    "the magnetic field is again important for cloud evolution after the second collapse phase because ohmic dissipation becomes less effective , and the magnetic field can be amplified .",
    "figure  [ fig:2]_c _ shows that @xmath134 has a minimum at @xmath135 , and then continues to increase for @xmath136 .",

    "as shown in figures  [ fig:14]_a _ and _ b _ , the centrifugal force is dominant over the lorentz and thermal pressure gradient forces inside the outflow ( @xmath301 , and @xmath302 1 ; black dots and lines ) , while it is comparable to the lorentz force inside the jet ( red dots and lines ) . outside the outflow ,",
    "both the centrifugal and thermal pressure gradient forces are stronger than the lorentz force ( @xmath303 ) , since @xmath304 ( fig .  [ fig:14]_c _ ) and @xmath305 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:14]_d _ ) .",
    "these results indicate that the outflow in model sr is mainly driven by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite , which causes the loosely pinched magnetic field lines inside the outflow .",
    "in addition , before the outflow appears , the magnetic field lines around the first core expand sideways toward the rotation axis from the center of the cloud , whose shape looks like a capital letter u or v , as shown by @xcite .",
    "thus , the collimation of the magnetic field lines becomes worse with distance from the center , as shown in figure  8_a _ of @xcite .",
    "since the outflow traces this configuration of the magnetic field lines , it does not have good collimation and the outflow driven from the first core has a wide opening angle because of the magnetocentrifugal driving mechanism and the configuration of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the former realizes the loosely pinched magnetic field lines , and the latter swells the outflow .      in this paper , we investigated cloud evolution with same magnetic field strengths ( @xmath306 g ) but different rotation rates [ @xmath307s@xmath22 ( model sr ) , @xmath308s@xmath22 ( model mr ) , and @xmath309s@xmath22 ( model fr ) ] .",
    "as shown in previous section , the speeds of the jets and outflows depend on the mass and size of their drivers .",
    "the mass and size of the first and second cores at their formation epochs depend on the initial rotation rate . therefore , the speeds of the jet and outflow depend on the initial rotation rate of the cloud core . for example , in a rapidly rotating clouds , the first core forms at lower density with larger size .",
    "when the first core has a large size and low density , the outflow is slow because the gravitational potential is shallow .",
    "on the other hand , a slowly rotating cloud produces a first core with smaller size and higher density . in this case",
    ", there is high - speed outflow , owing to the deep gravitational potential of the first core .",
    "thus , the outflow has higher speed in a more slowly ( rapidly ) rotating cloud .",
    "in addition , a cloud with an extremely low rotation rate produces no outflow because the first core has such a small angular momentum at its formation epoch that the magnetic field lines are barely twisted .",
    "the speed of the jet , however , depends on the initial rotation rate only slightly because the angular momentum around the center of the cloud converges to a certain value by the time the protostar ( i.e. , second core ) is formed @xcite .",
    "thus , the variation caused by the rotation of initial cloud is not a factor affecting the time of the protostar formation epoch .",
    "note that the properties of the jet and outflow might possibly change much later because we followed the evolution of these flows for only a short period .",
    "does the difference of magnetic field strength in the initial cloud affect the properties of the jet and outflow ?",
    "@xcite showed that the evolution of the molecular cloud depends only on the ratio of the angular velocity to the magnetic flux density of the initial cloud ( @xmath310 ) .",
    "initial differences in the distribution of the density , velocity , and magnetic field hardly affect cloud evolution , especially once the central region becomes adiabatic ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "cloud evolution is controlled by the magnetic field when @xmath311 , while it is controlled by the rotation when @xmath312 @xcite .",
    "although we can choose arbitrary parameter of @xmath313 and @xmath314 , observations indicate that the magnetic energy is much larger than the rotation energy in many molecular clouds @xcite , and clouds have @xmath312 ( i.e. , the magnetic - force dominant clouds in @xcite ) . in magnetic - force dominant clouds",
    ", the magnetic field converges to a specific value in the isothermal phase ( the magnetic flux - spin relation ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , cloud evolution does not depend much on the initial magnetic field strength . as a result",
    ", outflows and jets with similar properties may appear in these clouds when they have the same angular velocities at their initial state .      in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the outflow is driven from the first core .",
    "after the first core formation epoch , the collapse timescale becomes longer than the rotational timescale , the magnetic field lines are strongly twisted for the rotating first core , and outflow appears as shown in  3.2.2 .",
    "observations have shown that outflows have lifetimes of @xmath315yr @xcite . however , since we followed cloud evolution only through the very early phase , we could not determine whether outflow continues to be driven for a long time .",
    "the spherical symmetric calculation indicates that the first core disappears @xmath316 yr after its formation epoch . in model",
    "fr , we followed cloud evolution for @xmath317yr after the first core is formed . in this model ,",
    "the first core remains until the end of the calculation .",
    "the outflow that appears just after the first core formation epoch continues to be driven from the first core .",
    "the rotating first cores seem to have lifetimes of several thousand years or more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , outflows driven from these cores may maintain themselves for several thousand years .",
    "note that it is expected that a jet will continue to be driven from the protostar once it appears because the protostar does not disappear .",
    "after the first core disappeared , we could not determine whether the outflow continues to be driven .",
    "@xcite suggested that after the first core disappears , the remnant of the first core forms a disk - like structure or torus .",
    "outflow may continue to be driven from these objects even after the disappearance of the first core .",
    "however , if the outflow does not continue after the first core disappears , then outflow , as shown in this paper , might be a transient phenomena , in which the outflow is driven only for @xmath316yr . in this case",
    ", the flow from the first core , which we call outflow in this paper , might be a special phenomenon that would be observed only in limited numbers of young stellar objects . to understand the duration of the outflow driven from the first core , further long - term calculations , possibly with an implicit code , are necessary . at present",
    "we conjecture that the outflow in our calculations will be driven for @xmath318 years .",
    "observation shows that the outflows have wide opening angles and low flow speeds , while jets have good collimation and high flow speeds .",
    "outflow has been considered to be entrained by the jet driven from a circumstellar disk around the protostar . in this paper , we calculated the cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core to protostar formation . as a result of calculations",
    ", we found that two distinct flows ( outflow and jet ) are driven from different objects ( the first , and second cores ) , and the features of outflow and jet ( flow speed and collimation factor ) were naturally reproduced .",
    "our results show that the flow appearing around the first core has a wide opening angle and slow speed , while the jet appearing around the protostar has a well - collimated structure and high speed , as shown in figure  [ fig:15 ] .",
    "the speed difference is caused by the difference of the depth in the gravitational potential .",
    "the flow speed ( i.e. , the speed of the outflow and jet ) corresponds to the kepler speed of each object ( the first and the second cores ) .",
    "because the first core has a shallow gravitational potential , its flow ( outflow ) is slower .",
    "the flow ( jet ) driven from the protostar , which has a deeper gravitational potential , has a high speed . in our calculations ,",
    "the outflow and the jet have speeds of @xmath319 and @xmath257 , respectively .",
    "these speeds are slower than those of observations . typically , observed molecular outflow and optical jet have speeds of @xmath320 , and @xmath321 , respectively .",
    "however , since the first and second cores ( protostar ) have mass of @xmath322 and @xmath323 , respectively , at the end of the calculations , each core increases its mass in the subsequent gas accretion phase .",
    "the kepler speed increases with the square root of the mass of the central object at a fixed radius .",
    "when the mass of each core increases by 100 times , the kepler speed increases 10 times .",
    "thus , the speed of the outflow and jet may increase by 10 times , and reach @xmath324 and @xmath325 , respectively , which correspond to typical observed values .",
    "the outflow has a wide opening angle , while the jet has a well - collimated structure .",
    "this is caused both by the configuration of the magnetic field lines around the drivers and their driving mechanisms .",
    "the magnetic field lines around the first core have an hourglass configuration because they converge to the cloud center as the cloud collapses , and ohmic dissipation is ineffective before the first core formation .",
    "the flow appearing near the first core is mainly driven by the magnetocentrifugal wind mechanism ( disk wind ) .",
    "the centrifugal force is dominant in the outflow , whereas near the protostar , the magnetic field lines are a straight , and the magnetic pressure gradient mechanism is more effective for driving the jet .",
    "the magnetic field lines are stretched by the magnetic tension force near the protostar because the magnetic field is decoupled from the neutral gas . however , the magnetic field lines are strongly twisted in the region in close proximity to the protostar , where the magnetic field is coupled with the neutral gas again .",
    "thus , the strong toroidal field generated around the protostar can drive the jet , which is guided by the straight configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "our calculations do not completely reject the well - known concept that the observed molecular outflow is entrained by the jet , because we calculate the formation of the jet and outflow only in the early star - formation phase .",
    "further long - term calculations are needed to understand the mechanism of the jet and outflow in more detail .",
    "we have greatly benefited from the discussion with  t. nakano and  k. saigo .",
