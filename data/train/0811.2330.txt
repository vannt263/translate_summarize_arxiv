    "@xcite systems of a few qd s have been proposed theoretically as realizations of the two - channel kondo model ,  @xcite the so called ionic hubbard model ,  @xcite and the double exchange mechanism .",

    "@xcite    it is known that strong correlation effects invalidate the conventional quasiparticle description of fermi liquids and in one dimension lead to a fractionalization of the electronic excitations into pure charge and spin modes , as it has been shown using bosonization .",
    "haldane , schulz , kv , gia , kurt in this field theory , it becomes clear that in general ( except in some particular models  @xcite ) the hamiltonian at low energies can be separated into independent charge and spin parts . while this separation is an asymptotic low - energy property in an infinite chain , exact bethe ansatz results for the hubbard model in the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion @xmath3",
    "have shown that the wave function factorizes into a charge part and a spin part for any size of the system .",
    "@xcite    several experiments were reported that find indirect evidences of spin - charge separation  @xcite , and it could also be potentially observed  @xcite in systems such as cuprate chains and ladder compounds ,  @xcite and carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite    from the theoretical point of view , several calculations involving rings have been made .",
    "the real - time evolution of electronic wave packets in hubbard rings has shown a splitting in the dispersion of the spin and charge densities as a consequence of the different charge and spin velocities .",

    "@xcite    the transmittance through aharonov - bohm rings of length @xmath0 modeled by a tomonaga - luttinger liquid and connected to conducting leads at @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been studied by analytical methods.@xcite it is found that the transmittance integrated over an energy window shows dips when the threaded magnetic flux @xmath5 corresponds to particular fractional values of the flux quantum @xmath8 .",
    "this is rather striking because in the non - interacting case , one has a dip in the transmittance only when the applied flux @xmath9 , for which the conductance vanishes due to a negative interference of the waves traveling through both arms of the interferometer .",
    "jagla and balseiro obtained that the values of the flux at the dips are multiples of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the charge ( spin ) velocity , when @xmath13 is a simple fraction .",
    "this allows an appealing simple classicalinterpretation of the phenomenon : the electrons enter the ring at position @xmath14 , splitting into charge and spin components , which travel independently inside the ring , until they recombine at @xmath7 before leaving the ring .",
    "when the difference between the aharonov - bohm phases captured by the charges traveling in both possible senses of rotation is an odd multiple of @xmath15 , the transmittance is depressed .",
    "more recent work , however , indicates that the relevant ratio for the dips is in general @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the current velocity .",
    "@xcite    numerical calculations of the transmittance through finite rings described by the @xmath1 model , integrated over an energy window also show clear dips for fractional applied fluxes .",
    "@xcite this model is expected to be a realistic description for a ring of quantum dots if the charging energy @xmath3 is large in comparison with the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath4 .",
    "recently we have discussed the extension of these results to ladders of two legs as a first step to higher dimensions .",
    "@xcite    all the above calculations used a formalism valid at equilibrium and zero temperature , and an integration over a finite energy window to obtain the dips .",
    "in particular in ref .   this window contained all low - energy spin excitations with the same charge quantum numbers @xmath18 ( see section iii ) ) . in principle",
    ", this integration can be justified invoking a finite voltage bias or temperature .",
    "however , in the interacting case , under an applied bias , it is not clear that the total current through the device can be obtained integrating the _ equilibrium _ transmittance . in particular",

    "this process is not taken into account in the calculations .",
    "the effect of temperatures of the order of the spin excitation energy is also difficult to predict .",
    "these shortcomings raise the question of whether the dips can be really observed in an experimental setup .    in this work",
    ", we analyze the origin of the dips in the transmittance as a function of applied flux in finite rings described by a strongly correlated model and in particular , the @xmath1 model .",
    "we discuss the conditions for which the intensity of the first peak in the equilibrium conductance at zero temperature as a function of the gate voltage has a flux dependence with characteristic dips as a consequence of spin - charge separation .    in section ii we present the model , the formalism used to calculate the conductance , and some general statements on the conditions for which dips or reduced conductances are expected . in section iii",
    "we discuss the model with @xmath19 ( equivalent to the hubbard model with infinite @xmath3 ) , for which definite conclusions can be drawn on the basis of its exactly known energy spectrum .",

    "@xcite however , when the ground state of the isolated ring is non - degenerate , and the coupling @xmath34 between the leads and ring is weak , the equilibrium conductance at zero temperature can be expressed to second order in @xmath34 in terms of the retarded green s function for the isolated ring between sites @xmath31 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 .",

    "however , in general , for an odd number of electrons , the ground state of the isolated ring is kramers degenerate for a system with time reversal symmetry and the equation ceases to be valid , missing the physics of the ensuing ( non - perturbative ) kondo effect in which the electrons of the leads screen the spin of the ring .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the characteristic energy of this kondo effect decreases exponentially with decreasing @xmath34 and therefore for small enough @xmath34 the kondo effect is destroyed by a zeeman term or temperature small in comparison with the other energy scales in the problem . here",

    "the dips tend to merge into one near @xmath187 .    preparing the system with an odd number of electrons , like a half - filled system with an odd number of sites , has the advantage that more than one total spin is available for the intermediate states ( 0 and 1 in this case ) and more dips are observable .",
    "we have shown for the first time that the _ equilibrium _ conductance through finite rings described by the @xmath1 model threaded by a magnetic flux , weakly coupled to conducting leads , at _ zero _ temperature , shows depressions at particular values of the flux .",
    "in general , for any strongly correlated model , these depressions are related with level crossings of excited states and the degree of interference depends on the wave vectors of these excited states , as described in section ii c. previous results involved an integration over an energy window which included several excited states and this procedure could cast doubts on the validity of the behaviour for equilibrium conductance at zero or very low temperatures .    for the @xmath1 model and @xmath19 , using the exactly known energy spectrum of the isolated ring",
    ", we have determined the conditions under which dips in the integrated transmittance should occur , for different number of particles and sites of the ring .",
    "the position of the dips reflect the particular features of the spectrum for @xmath19 , in which the charge and spin degrees of freedom are separated at all energies , and not only asymptotically at low energies , as expected in luttinger liquids .",
    "@xcite    in the equilibrium conductance at zero temperature , only the first peak in the transmittance as a function of gate voltage is accessible in an experimental setup .",
    "depression of this conductance is expected in general at certain values of the applied magnetic flux , which are given by eq .",

    "the negative interference is more marked if the leads are connected at angles near 180 degrees .",
    "these results are confirmed by our numerical calculations .",
    "the positions of depressed conductance are modified as @xmath165 is increased in a way which seems difficult to predict . for moderate values of @xmath165",
    "it is not clear for us , how to relate any particular position to a specific change in the spin quantum number .",
    "in addition , the number of these positions seems to decrease with increasing @xmath165 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with expectations based on the increase of the spin velocity ,  @xcite which should increase with @xmath165 . in particular ,",
    "our results are valid for half - filled systems which we believe are easier to realize experimentally .",
    "note , however , that due to particular selection rules explained at the end of section iii , the system size @xmath0 should be different than four to observe dips in the conductance . in any case and for any model ,",
    "if the energy , wave vector and spin of the ground state is known when one particle is added to or removed from the system , the position of the dips can be predicted following the arguments of section ii c.    due to selection rules related with total spin , more dips are expected for systems with an odd number of particles .",

    "this expression can not capture non - perturbative effects , like the kondo physics .",
    "@xcite however , the physics of the depression of the conductance is present independently of the formalism used to calculate it .",
    "nevertheless a more elaborate calculation of the conductance would be desirable .",
    "one possibility is to use numerical results for the ring to construct an effective model for the low - energy physics including the leads , and solve the model by non - perturbative methods .",
