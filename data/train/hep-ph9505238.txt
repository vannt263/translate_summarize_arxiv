    "semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons have received a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "the decay channel @xmath9 has the largest branching fraction of all @xmath1-meson decay modes , and large data samples have been collected by various experimental groups . from the theoretical point of view , semileptonic decays are simple enough to allow for a reliable , quantitative description . yet , the analysis of these decays provides much information about the strong forces that bind the quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "schematically , a semileptonic decay process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the strength of the @xmath10 transition vertex is governed by the element @xmath11 of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "the parameters of this matrix are fundamental parameters of the standard model .",
    "a primary goal of the study of semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons is to extract with high precision the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the problem is that the standard model lagrangian describing these transitions is formulated in terms of quark and gluon fields , whereas the physical hadrons are bound states of these degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , an understanding of the transition from the quark to the hadron world is necessary before the fundamental parameters can be extracted from experimental data .    today",
    ", our knowledge of the elements of the ckm matrix , as extracted from direct measurements of flavour - changing transitions , is as follows : the best known entries are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which have an uncertainty of @xmath15 and 1% , respectively .",
    "the next well known entry is already related to the @xmath16-quark ; @xmath11 is now determined to an accuracy of 7% .",
    "then follow @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath12 , with 10% , 20% , and 30% uncertainties , respectively .",
    "no direct measurements exist for the matrix elements related to the top quark .    in this talk",
    "i discuss the status of the theoretical developments underlying the determination of @xmath11 , both from exclusive and from inclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons .",
    "with the discovery of heavy - quark symmetry ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , it has become clear that the study of the exclusive semileptonic decay mode @xmath19 allows for a reliable determination of @xmath0 , which is free , to a large extent , of hadronic uncertainties @xcite@xcite .",
    "model dependence enters this analysis only at the level of power corrections of order @xmath20 .",
    "gev as a characteristic low - energy scale of the strong interactions , and @xmath21 as a generic notation for @xmath22 or @xmath23 . ]",
    "these corrections can be investigated in a systematic way , using the heavy - quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "they are found to be small , of order a few per cent .",
    "the analysis consists in measuring the recoil spectrum in the decay @xmath9 .",
    "one introduces the kinematic variable @xmath24 which is the product of the four - velocities of the mesons . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the recoil energy of the @xmath26 meson in the parent rest frame , and @xmath27 is the invariant momentum transfer .",
    "the differential decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath28\\,|\\,v_{cb}|^2\\,{\\cal{f}}^2(w ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath6 denotes the ( suitably defined ) hadronic form factor for this decay .",
    "it is conventional to factorize it in the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a short - distance coefficient , and the function @xmath31 contains the long - distance hadronic dynamics . apart from corrections of order @xmath32 ,",
    "this function coincides with the isgur  wise form factor @xcite . in analogy to the case of light - quark su(3 ) flavour symmetry , in which the ademollo  gatto theorem protects the @xmath33 transition form factor against first - order symmetry - breaking corrections at @xmath34 @xcite , there is a theorem which protects the function @xmath31 against first - order @xmath32 corrections at the kinematic point of zero recoil ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is luke s theorem @xcite , which determines the normalization of @xmath31 at @xmath35 up to corrections of order @xmath20 , i.e.  @xmath36 .",
    "the strategy for a precise determination of @xmath0 is thus to extract the product @xmath37 from a measurement of the differential decay rate , and to extrapolate it to @xmath35 to measure @xmath38 the task of theorists is to provide a reliable calculation of the quantities @xmath30 and @xmath39 in order to turn this measurement into a precise determination of @xmath0 .",
    "i will now discuss the status of these calculations .",
    "0.8 cm _ 2.1  perturbative corrections",
    "_ 0.3 cm    the short - distance coefficient @xmath30 takes into account the finite renormalization of the axial vector current arising from virtual gluon exchange .",
    "it can be calculated in perturbation theory . at the one - loop order",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath40 the scale @xmath41 of the running coupling constant is not determined at this order .",
    "a reasonable choice is to take the average virtuality of the gluon in the one - loop diagrams @xcite . in the case of @xmath30",
    ", this so - called blm scale has been calculated to be @xmath42 ( in the @xmath43 scheme ) @xcite .",
    "taking then @xmath44  gev , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  gev for the scale parameter in the two - loop expression for the running coupling constant , one obtains values in the range @xmath470.965 .",
    "several ( partial ) higher - order calculations have been performed to improve this result .",
    "using renormalization - group techniques , logarithms of the type @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , have been resummed to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "this leads to the somewhat larger value @xmath52 .",
    "another class of higher - order corrections consists of the so - called renormalon chain contributions , which are terms of order @xmath53 in the perturbative series for @xmath30 .",
    "resumming these terms to all orders gives the lower value @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the main virtue of these partial higher - order calculations is to provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty in the value of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , i quote the final result as @xmath55    0.8 cm _ 2.2  power corrections _ 0.3 cm    hadronic uncertainties enter the determination of @xmath0 at the level of second - order power corrections , which are expected to be of order @xmath56 . for a precision measurement",
    ", it is important to understand the structure of these corrections in detail .",
    "this is the most complicated aspect of the theoretical analysis , which unavoidably introduces some amount of model dependence .",
    "however , since the goal is to estimate an effect which by itself is very small , even a large relative error in @xmath39 is acceptable .",
    "three approaches have been suggested to estimate these corrections .",
    "the idea of the `` exclusive '' approach of falk and myself is to classify all @xmath57 operators in the heavy - quark effective theory and to estimate their matrix elements between meson states @xcite .",
    "this last step is model - dependent .",
    "a typical result obtained in this way is @xmath58 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the error has been increased to @xmath59 in order to account for the model dependence and unknown higher - order corrections .",
    "a similar result , @xmath60 , has been obtained by mannel @xcite .",
    "the idea of the `` inclusive '' approach of shifman et al .  is to apply the operator product expansion to the @xmath1-meson matrix element of the time - ordered product of two flavour - changing currents , and to equate the resulting theoretical expression to a phenomenological expression obtained by saturating the matrix element with physical intermediate states @xcite .",
    "this leads to sum rules that imply inequalities for the @xmath61 transition form factors .",
    "in particular , one obtains the bound @xmath62 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite make an `` educated guess '' that the value of @xmath39 is actually much larger , namely @xmath63 .",
    "it is possible to combine the above predictions in a `` hybrid '' approach , which uses the sum rules to put bounds on the hadronic parameters that enter the `` exclusive '' analysis @xcite .",
    "one then finds that for all reasonable choices of parameters the results are in the range @xmath64 , which is consistent with all previous estimates at the @xmath65 level .",
    "thus , i quote the final result as @xmath66    0.8 cm _ 2.3  determination of @xmath0 _ 0.3 cm    combining the above results ,",
    "i obtain for the normalization of the hadronic form factor at zero recoil @xmath67 to be conservative , i have added the theoretical errors linearly .",
    "three experiments have recently presented new measurements of the product @xmath68 . when rescaled using the new lifetime values @xmath69",
    "ps and @xmath70  ps @xcite , the results are @xmath71 where the first error is statistical and the second one systematic .",
    "i will follow the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite and add @xmath72 to these values to account for a small positive curvature . ] of the function @xmath6 . taking the weighted average of the experimental results , which is @xmath73 , and using the theoretical prediction ( [ etaxi ] ) ,",
    "i then obtain @xmath74 which corresponds to a measurement of @xmath0 with 7% accuracy .",
    "0.8 cm _ 2.4  prediction for the slope parameter @xmath75 _ 0.3 cm    in the extrapolation of the differential decay rate ( [ bdrate ] ) to zero recoil , the slope of the function @xmath6 close to @xmath35 plays an important role .",
    "one defines a parameter @xmath75 by @xmath76 it is important to distinguish @xmath75 from the slope parameter @xmath77 of the isgur  wise function .",
    "they differ by corrections that break the heavy - quark symmetry . whereas the slope of the isgur  wise function is a universal , mass - independent parameter , the slope of the physical form factor depends on logarithms and inverse powers of the heavy - quark masses .",
    "the relation between the two parameters is @xcite @xmath78 an estimate of the @xmath32 corrections to this relation is model - dependent and thus has a large theoretical uncertainty .",
    "i shall not attempt it here .",
    "the slope parameter of the isgur  wise function , @xmath77 , is constrained by the bjorken @xcite and voloshin @xcite sum rules . at the tree level , it was known for a long time that @xmath79 .",
    "however , only recently grozin and korchemsky have shown how to include perturbative and nonperturbative corrections to these bounds @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . here",
    ", the scale parameter @xmath80 has to be chosen large enough for the operator product expansion to be well defined , but it is otherwise arbitrary . assuming that values @xmath81  gev are sufficiently large , one finds that @xmath77 is constrained to be very close to 0.6 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with earlier predictions obtained from qcd sum rules , which gave @xmath82 @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , and using ( [ rhorel ] ) , i conclude that @xmath83 this prediction compares well with the average value observed experimentally , which is @xmath84 @xcite@xcite .",
    "complementary to the analysis of exclusive decays is the study of the inclusive semileptonic decay rate for @xmath85 . since @xmath86",
    ", one can to very good approximation neglect the contribution of charmless final states and consider @xmath87 to be a hadronic state containing a charm particle .",
    "an obvious advantage of inclusive decays is the existence of high - statistics data samples . from the theoretical point of view , summing over many final states eliminates part of the hadronic uncertainty .    as in the exclusive case ,",
    "the framework for the theoretical description of inclusive decays is provided by the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "it could be shown that the leading term in this expansion reproduces the free - quark decay model , while the nonperturbative corrections to this model can be systematically included in an expansion in powers of @xmath88 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the total semileptonic decay rate can be written as @xmath89 where the ellipsis represents terms of higher order in @xmath88 or @xmath90 . in this expression ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath22 denote the pole masses ( defined to the appropriate order in perturbation theory ) of the heavy quarks , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are kinematic functions , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are nonperturbative hadronic parameters .",
    "i will now discuss the theoretical uncertainties in the evaluation of ( [ gamtot ] ) .",
    "0.8 cm _ 3.1  perturbative corrections",
    "_ 0.3 cm    let me first discuss the uncertainty due to unknown higher - order perturbative corrections .",
    "only the correction of order @xmath90 is known exactly @xcite",
    ". however , recently luke et al .",
    "have computed the part of the next - order term that depends on the number of light - quark flavours @xcite . in the @xmath43 scheme ,",
    "the result is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the decay rate at the tree level , and @xmath97 is the first coefficient of the @xmath98-function . if one uses this partial calculation to estimate the uncertainty , which for an asymptotic series is given by the size of the last term to be included , one finds @xmath99 , which is in good agreement with an estimate of the renormalization - scale and -scheme dependence by ball and nierste @xcite .",
    "recently , ball et al.have performed an all - order resummation of the terms of order @xmath53 for the above series @xcite .",
    "they find that the effect of higher - order terms is important and leads to @xmath100 .",
    "note that this corresponds to an effective scale @xmath101  gev in ( [ gamtot ] ) , which is rather low . the corresponding value of the coupling constant is @xmath102 .",
    "it is difficult to derive a reliable error estimate from these analyses , but i think a reasonable number is @xmath103    0.8 cm _ 3.2  power corrections _ 0.3 cm    the leading power corrections in the expression for the inclusive decay rate appear at order @xmath104 .",
    "they are proportional to two hadronic parameters with a simple physical interpretation : @xmath93 is related to the average momentum of the @xmath16-quark inside a @xmath1 meson at rest , and @xmath94 is proportional to the vector ",
    "pseudoscalar mass splitting .",
    "i shall use @xmath105 the value of @xmath93 is a compromise between the theoretical estimates obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the power corrections reduce the total decay rate by @xmath106 , which is a rather small effect .",
    "the uncertainty in the value of @xmath93 introduces an uncertainty on the value of @xmath107 of 0.6% , which is almost negligible .",
    "i increase this value in order to account for higher - order power corrections , which i expect to be of order @xmath108 , and quote @xmath109 this is the smallest contribution to the total theoretical uncertainty .",
    "3.3  dependence on quark masses _ 0.3 cm    another source of nonperturbative uncertainty results from the appearance of the heavy - quark masses in the expression for the inclusive decay rate .",
    "the pole masses of the bottom and charm quarks have an uncertainty of at least several hundred mev .",
    "since the rate is proportional to @xmath110 , this seems to be a severe limitation .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the actual uncertainty is lower due to a strong correlation between the values of the two heavy - quark masses @xcite .",
    "in fact , one should consider the decay rate as a function of @xmath23 and of the difference @xmath111 .",
    "i shall assume that @xmath23 has an uncertainty of 300  mev . however , the mass difference is known to much higher precision . using the heavy - quark expansion",
    ", one can derive that @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113  gev and @xmath114  gev denote the spin - averaged meson masses .",
    "this relation leads to @xmath115 where the first error reflects the uncertainty in the value of @xmath93 , and the second one takes into account unknown higher - order corrections .",
    "hereafter , i shall assume an uncertainty of 60  mev in the value of @xmath116 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , i show the dependence of the decay rate on these two parameters , using the value @xmath117 for the strong coupling constant in ( [ gamtot ] ) . clearly , the variation with @xmath116 is much stronger than the variation with @xmath23 . for @xmath44  gev and @xmath118  gev",
    ", i find the partial derivatives @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "since the errors in @xmath23 and @xmath116 are essentially uncorrelated , this leads to @xmath121 note that this is dominated by the ( rather small ) uncertainty in the mass difference @xmath116 .",
    "0.8 cm _ 3.4  determination of @xmath0 _ 0.3 cm    adding the above errors linearly and taking the square root ,",
    "i conclude that the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath0 from inclusive decays is @xmath122 from an analysis of the experimental data , one then obtains @xcite @xmath123 the theoretical uncertainty in these numbers is somewhat larger than in the case of the exclusive analysis ; however , the experimental errors are smaller .",
    "the most precise measurements of the element @xmath11 of the ckm matrix come from the analysis of semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons . from the measurement of the recoil spectrum in the exclusive channel @xmath9 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath124 where the theoretical error is dominated by the uncertainty in the calculation of nonperturbative power corrections of order @xmath20 . from the measurement of the total inclusive decay rate ,",
    "on the other hand , one finds @xmath125 in this case , the main theoretical uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the value of the quark mass difference @xmath126 , as well as from higher - order perturbative corrections .",
    "given the fact that both methods are very different both from the experimental and from the theoretical point of view , it is most satisfying that the results are in perfect agreement . combining them ,",
