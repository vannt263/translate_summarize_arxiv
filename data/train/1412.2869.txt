    "white - dwarf + main - sequence ( wdms ) binaries are very important celestial objects since they constitute a common final state objects of stellar evolution , a wd , and a ms star .",
    "they are the potential progenitors for most cataclysmic variables and perhaps type ia supernova ( sn ia ) and are therefore a subject which can inspire the keen interest of many investigators @xcite .",
    "the wdms binaries are compact binaries containing a wd component whose progenitor star should have undergone a giant star ( usually during red giant branch or a asymptotic giant branch ) phase as a single star @xcite , the progenitor binaries of the wdms binaries should be the wide initial ones .",
    "it is well known that the orbital separation of all types of close compact binaries , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , x - ray binaries and double degenerate binaries are much shorter than the radius ( @xmath2 ) of a giant star @xcite , implying that a large amount of angular momentum and orbital energy of their progenitor binaries have been lost by an unusual physical mechanism so called a common envelope ( ce ) evolution phase @xcite . up to now",
    ", the ce phase is believed to be a result of dynamically unstable mass transfer from a giant star to its ms companion @xcite . at the beginning of the ce evolution ,",
    "the secondary star starts a spiral - in process , then the ce is gradually ejected from the binary system owing to the friction induced by asynchronous rotation in ce .",
    "when the ce has been completely ejected from the system at the end of ce evolution , a post common envelope binary ( pceb ) , which consists of a compact object and a companion star , appears .",
    "the ce evolution phase plays a central role in many evolutionary pathways leading to the formation of compact objects in the short period binary systems @xcite , such x - ray binaries as natural laboratories for general relativity , cvs and double degenerate wd binaries as the potential progenitors of sn ia , together with double degenerate neutron star binaries as the progenitors of short gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "although the main features during the ce evolution phase have been depicted by @xcite more than 30 years ago , and a lot of works on the formation theory of pcebs have been carried out by various investigators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , owing to the complex physical processes occurred in the ce phase and lack of the observational constraints , our understanding about ce phase is still very poor @xcite .",
    "since the detached pcebs have not been severely contaminated by mass transfer after they formed through a ce evolution , they are thought to be the most suitable objects for the constraints of the ce evolution result .",
    "that is to say , they are almost the real materials produced by the ce evolution except that the size of their orbit has been decreased by am loss owing to magnetic stellar wind and/or gravitational wave radiation . among all pcebs ,",
    "those composed of a wd and a ms star represent the most promising population for deriving such observational constraints , as they are essentially most common population of pcebs and their physical parameters can be derived from observations through 2 - 8 m telescopes @xcite .",
    "one of the many interesting by - products of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the identification of a large number of unresolved , close binary systems .",
    "in particular , the five - color ( @xmath3 photometry and @xmath4 ) and spectra covering almost the entire optical wavelength range permit to easy identification of binaries contained a blue white dwarf ( blue ) and a red low - mass m dwarf secondary @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sdss has been thought to be very efficient in searching for wdms binaries .",
    "up to now , more than 2,500 wdms binaries have been discovered in sdss survey @xcite since @xcite and @xcite first attempted to investigate the wdms binaries in the sdss , however the orbital periods of only about 200 wdms binaries have been determined by the various investigators through the radial velocity observations , and is clearly very insufficient to limit the results of the ce evolution .",
    "this suggests that the orbital periods of of most wdms binaries are difficultly determined by observations due to insufficient telescope time for their radial velocity observations .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to find more wdms binaries from the new data released by sdss or by other spectral survey telescope , such as lamost ( also called guoshoujing telescope , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we present 309 new wdms binaries , which are mainly composed of a white dwarf and an m dwarf , newly identified from sdss ( dr10 ) based on a color - selection criteria @xcite originally developed by @xcite and a criteria developed by gong et al .",
    "( 2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have analyzed their sdss spectra by using a method proposed by @xcite , then derived the fundamental physical parameters for the two spectral components in each wdms binary which are composed of a da / db white dwarf and an m - dwarf . at",
    "last , based on the stellar parameter distributions , the general properties of the wdms binaries identified from sdss by us are discussed .",
    "based on a color - selection criteria @xcite originally developed by @xcite and a color - selection criteria for searching for wd stars from lamost and sdss ( gong et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) , we identified 2198 wdms binaries from sdss dr10 , and 1889 wdms binaries of them had been identified by the previous investigators @xcite . therefore , 309 new wdms binaries are identified from sdss dr10 . in these new binaries ,",
    "220 binary systems contain a da wd component , 32 systems contain a db wd component , and 57 systems contain a wd component with the other spectral types or an unknown spectral type because of a low sn .",
    "the infrared counterparts of some new wdms binaries are obtained by cross - match ( in a radius of 5 arc - seconds ) with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass : * ? ? ?",

    "based on a method , which can remove a mutual dependence of the scaling factors and the effects of identifying a local @xmath9 minimum , proposed by @xcite , we decomposed / fitted the observed spectra of the new wdms binaries ( with a da / db wd component ) identified from sdss dr10 . in the course of the fitting of their spectra",

    ", we employ a theoretical spectral grid of db wds also developed by @xcite , in which the surface gravity , @xmath10 , covers a range from 7.0 to 9.0 in steps of 0.25 , and the effective temperature , @xmath11 , covers a range from 8,000 k to 40,000 k , in steps of 500 k for @xmath12 k , 1,000 k for @xmath13 , and 2,000 k for @xmath14 . with the help of these theoretical spectral grids ,",
    "we can obtain the surface gravity and effective temperature of da / db wds in wdms binaries identified from sdss dr10 .",
    "the parameter spaces of the surface gravity and effective temperature for the m dwarfs are the same as those used in @xcite .",
    "since the determination of the m dwarf metallicity is easily affected by the signal - to - noise ratio ( sn ) of the observed spectra of the wdms binaries which should be in the neighborhood of the sun @xcite , the metallicity of the m dwarfs is set to be the solar abundance , i.e. @xmath15=0 $ ] , in this work , then the template spectra can be produced by the second version of basel standard library @xcite .",
    "in addition , a few new wdms binaries found from sdss dr10 with a k - dwarf star companion . in the course of the spectral fitting of these wdms binaries , the parameter spaces of the effective temperature , surface gravity , mass and radius of the k - dwarf stars are produced according to the theoretical models given by @xcite .",
    "the template spectra for k dwarfs are also given by the basel standard library .",
    "on the basis of the best fitting result of the observed spectrum , we can obtain the effective temperature and surface gravity of the ms star companion in each wdms binary .",
    "the results of the spectral analysis of three typical wdms binaries [ sdss j163033.26 + 393714.0 ( containing a da wd star and an m dwarf companion ) , sdss j111615.65 + 251716.1 ( containing a da wd star and a k - type star companion ) and sdss j103334.76 + 131159.6 ( containing a db wd star and an m dwarf companion ) ] are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the effective temperature and surface gravity determined for the two components in wdms binaries through spectral analysis are presented in table 2 .",
    "based on the spectral type of the m dwarf and the empirical relations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite , the mass and the radius of the m dwarf in each wdms binary can be derived . for the wds in wdms binaries , their parameters @xmath18 and @xmath10",
    "are determined from the best spectral fitting based on results of a 1d model atmosphere @xcite at first , then they are revised to the results of a 3d model atmosphere @xcite for da wds with @xmath19 .",

    "2 , the effective temperature of the white dwarfs in most wdms binaries is located in a region between 6,000 k and 25,000 k , only about 25 per cent of the white dwarfs in wdms binaries have an effective temperature higher than 25,000 k in both cases .",

    "this phenomenon was primarily found in sdss j143947.62 - 010606.9 by @xcite , who suggest this is caused by the photoionization and recombination induced by irradiation of the m dwarfs in these wdms binaries rather than the mass accretion as that in cvs , since the emission line width ( @xmath44 angstroms ) in these wdms binaries is much narrower than that ( @xmath45 angstroms ) in cvs . as seen from fig .",

    "this suggests that about 80 percent of the wdms binaries with a da / db white dwarf component have @xmath71 , implying that about 20 per cent of these binary systems show a significant difference between the two distance estimates for the wds and m - dwarfs .",

    "@xcite reports 180 wdms binaries identified from sdss dr10 , 120 of which have been discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , about 60 wdms binaries recently found by @xcite are probably in 309 wdms binaries discoverd by us independently .",
    "based on a @xmath9 minimization technique originally developed by @xcite and @xcite , we have determined the independent stellar parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravitation , mass , radius and distance ) of the two components in 237 new wdms binaries with a da / db wd component .",

    "one possible explanation for this behaviour is that the sn of the observed spectra has a significant influence on the determination of the metallicity of the m dwarfs and the surface gravity of two components , and maybe on the determination of the masses of the wd stars in wdms binaries .",
    "we analyze the spectra of these wdms binaries again based on an assumption that the metallicity of the m dwarfs in these binaries is the solar one .",
    "in fact , all of these binaries are in the neighborhood of the sun , and the atmosphere of the m dwarfs in wdms binaries should not be seriously polluted by the progenitors of the wds in these systems because the timescale of the ce phase is very short and the m dwarfs usually have a deep surface convective zone .",
    "another possible explanation for this behaviour is that the so - called high-@xmath73 problem is presented in 1d model atmosphere of da wds @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the values of the effective temperature and surface gravity of the da wds ( with @xmath0 k ) determined in 1d models are revised to those in 3d model atmosphere for the da wds @xcite .",

    "the stellar parameter distributions have used to probe the general properties of the wdms binaries , it is found in fig .",
    "2 that the effective temperature of the wds in the majority of our wdms binaries is lower than 25,000k , the surface gravity of the wds in wdms binaries peaks at @xmath75 , and the mass of them peaks at @xmath76 . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the cooling age of the wds peaks at @xmath77 , the mean cooling age of the wds is of @xmath78 yrs , and the young wds are very rare .",

    "* ) show hydrogen emission in all observable balmer series lines in addition he i emission ( see fig . 6 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this behaviour is photoionization and recombination of m dwarfs caused by the irradiation of m dwarfs due to their very hot wd companions .",
    "it is found in fig . 6 that the wds in these wdms binaries usually have a very high effective temperature , and therefore they should be very young wds according to their spectral profile ( such as sdss j095043.96 + 391541.7 with @xmath79 k and @xmath80 and sdss j111544.56 + 425822.4 with @xmath81 k and @xmath82 ) . also as seen from fig .",
    "6 , three of these binaries show the shift of @xmath83 or @xmath84 emission line , implying that the components of these binary systems exhibit the variation in their radial velocities , especially for the system sdss j095043.96 + 391541.7 , its two sdss spectra only cover a time interval of one day ( mjd55622 and mjd55623 ) .",
    "this suggests that four such wdms binaries should be pcebs with a short orbital period , and the system sdss j143947.62 - 010606.9 should be a pcebs with very low orbital inclination .",

    "two independent distances for two components in wdms binaries are derived on the basis of two flux - scaling factors described in @xcite .",

    "approximately one - fifth of wdms binary systems suffer a significant difference between @xmath29 and @xmath87 .",
    "this is similar to the results derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the significant difference between @xmath29 and @xmath88 might be a result of the @xmath89 emission and/or other types of balmer emission ( such as sdss j143012.51 + 250437.6 , sdss j213019.79 + 061204.6 , and sdss j215713.29 - 001958.8 ) owing to the stellar activity of the m dwarfs in these wdms binaries , which might cause a too early spectral type to be determined for the m dwarfs in wdms binaries @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , another explanation for this behaviour is the expansion in the radii of m dwarfs irradiated by their close hotter wd primary @xcite , such as in sdss j095043.96 + 391541.7 and sdss j 111544.56 + 425822.4 mentioned above .",
