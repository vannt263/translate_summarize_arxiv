    "the goal of this paper is to explore the systematics of jet production and fragmentation in @xmath0  collisions at @xmath1=200  by the method of two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "knowledge of the jet - fragmentation process is useful not only as a reference measurement for a similar analysis in @xmath5  collisions , but can be used as a stringent test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations beyond leading order .",
    "the two - particle azimuthal correlations method worked well at isr energies ( @xmath1=63  ) and below @xcite , where it is difficult to directly reconstruct jets , but has not been attempted at higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "this method is also suitable for jet - analysis in heavy ion data where the large particle multiplicity severely interferes with direct jet reconstruction .    with the beginning of rhic operation , heavy - ion physics entered a new regime , where pqcd phenomena can be fully explored .",
    "high - energy partons materializing into hadronic jets can be used as sensitive probes of the early stage of heavy ion collisions .",
    "measurements carried out during the first three years of rhic operation at @xmath6=130 and 200  exhibit many new and interesting features .",
    "the high-  particle yield was found to be strongly suppressed in @xmath5  central collisions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the non - suppression of the high-  particle yield in @xmath7  induced collisions @xcite confirmed that the suppression can be fully attributed to the final state interaction of high - energy partons with an extremely opaque nuclear medium formed in @xmath5  collisions at rhic .",
    "other striking features found in rhic data are the large asymmetry of particle azimuthal distributions which is attributed to sizable elliptic flow @xcite and the observation of the apparent disappearance of the back - to - back jet correlation in central @xmath5collisions @xcite .    many of the above mentioned observations can be explained by a large opacity of the medium produced in central @xmath5  collisions which causes the scattered partons to lose energy via coherent ( landau - pomeranchuk - migdal @xcite ) gluon bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the medium effect will cause the apparent modification of fundamental properties of hard - scattering like broadening of intrinsic parton transverse momentum @xcite and modification of jet fragmentation @xcite .",
    "thus the measurement of jet fragmentation properties and intrinsic parton transverse momentum  for @xmath0collisions presented here provides a baseline for comparison to the results in heavy ion collisions , helping to disentangle the complex processes of propagation and possible fragmentation of partons within the excited nuclear medium .",
