    "a focused gaussian beam propagating through a biaxial crystal parallel to one of the optics axes , i.e. under conditions of conical refraction ( cr ) , is transformed at the focal plane of the system into a pair of concentric bright rings separated by a null - intensity ( poggendorff ) ring , as long as the ring radius ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the length of the crystal and @xmath2 its conicity ) is much larger than the waist radius of the input beam ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. for @xmath4 @xcite , see fig .",

    "recently , it was reported that cr can be understood in terms of the intersection of two light cones generated inside the biaxial crystal @xcite .",
    "the vertex of each cone corresponds to one raman spot and , in the half - way distance between them , two bright rings with poggendorff splitting can be found due to the interference between both light cones , as shown in fig .",

    "the aim of the present article is to show the dual - cone nature of the cr beam without the need of blocking the beam anywhere and to present a self - consistent dual - cone model by taking into account both amplitude and polarization properties of the light beams .",
    "we make use of an azimuthally segmented polarizer that mimics the cr polarization distribution to modulate the intensity of each of the two light cones , which allows us to observe their behavior separately .",

    "additionally , cr cones @xmath25 have almost identical polarization distribution between the raman spots and , consequently , they can interfere with each other , which leads to the double bright ring pattern with the poggendorff fine splitting at the lloyd ring plane previously observed in conical refraction . if the polarization distribution of an input beam coincides with one of the cr cones , the interference pattern at the lloyd plane , i.e. the poggendorff dark ring , disappears as shown theoretically in fig .",

    "we mount it over a micro - positioner that allows modifying independently the @xmath38 and @xmath39 angles ( when considering spherical coordinates ) and we image the transverse cr pattern at the focal plane with a ccd camera , while slightly modifying the @xmath38 and @xmath39 angles until a cylindrically symmetric pattern is obtained .",
