    "gunn - peterson tests by the observations of high - redshift qsos indicated cosmic reionization completed at @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the ionization history of integer - galactic medium ( igm ) has not been understood yet .",
    "recent observations of high - redshift galaxies at @xmath12 are gradually unveiling the cosmic star formation history @xcite , and have allowed us to speculate the cosmic reionization history @xcite . yet , even considering the above observational constraints , various reionization histories remain viable @xcite .",
    "one of the main uncertainties is low - mass galaxy formation with the halo mass @xmath13 less than @xmath14 . due to their higher number density and the higher escape fraction of ionizing photons from them @xcite",
    ", low - mass galaxies can be responsible for main ionizing sources .",
    "however , the detection sensitivities of current observations are not sufficient to constrain the formation of low - mass galaxies .",
    "therefore it is important to theoretically investigate the formation of low - mass galaxies and their contribution to cosmic reionization .",
    "most of high - redshift low - mass galaxies are observed as @xmath0 emitters ( laes ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite indicated that laes were hosted in halos with the halo mass @xmath15 by the clustering analysis ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that laes were not dust - enriched well yet so that @xmath0 photons escaped from galaxies against dust attenuation ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these suggest laes are likely to be in the early phase of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , laes are one of major populations of galaxies contributing the cosmic star - formation density in the early universe @xcite .",
    "laes also have been used as a tool to investigate the early universe @xcite .",
    "number density of laes rapidly decreases at @xmath12 @xcite , indicating that @xmath0 fluxes from some galaxies were significantly attenuated due to neutral hydrogen in the igm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "meanwhile , laes themselves could provide sufficient ionizing photons into the igm @xcite , and some of them could make giant hii bubbles that allowed @xmath0 photons to reach us . in this case , galaxies can be observed as laes . in practice , the most distant lae has been observed even at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "thus , laes can be the key objects in understanding the galaxy formation and cosmic reionization . in this work",
    ", we investigate the evolution of laes with their associated hii bubbles . by modeling both laes and hii bubbles simultaneously",
    ", we estimate @xmath0 luminosity functions ( lfs ) , number density of laes , size distribution of hii bubbles , and the relation between @xmath0 flux and the size of hii bubble .",
    "these estimations are useful for future observational missions .",
    "james webb space telescope ( jwst ) is going to be launched at 2018 , and aims to observe galaxies at @xmath5 . its high sensitivity of spectroscopy will make it possible to detect @xmath0 flux from galaxies if they distribute in giant hii bubbles . later on , 30-m class ground telescopes , the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , and the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) , will investigate galaxies at @xmath5 statistically .",
    "in addition , several 21-cm observational missions are on going , e.g. , the low frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in future ,",
    "square kilometer array phase-2 ( ska-2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will perform large - scale 21-cm tomography . since 21-cm emission comes from hi gas , detections of holes of 21-cm signal indicate giant hii bubbles around galaxies .",
    "therefore , a combination of 21-cm and galaxy observations will provide fruitful information about the cosmic reionization and galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "theoretically large - scale simulations showed that galaxies made patchy ionization structures in an inside - out fashion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas low - density void regions would be ionized first , in the so - called outside - in fashion , if agns were the main ionizing sources .",
    "however , agns are unlikely to be main ionizing sources because of the rapid decrease of observed number density at redshift @xmath17 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the contribution of faint agns is still under the debate @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we model laes assuming the reionization model with the inside - out fashion . in order to understand cosmic reionization",
    "theoretically , we need high spatial resolution to follow the detailed physical processes of interstellar medium , as well as large volume to consider large - scale inhomogeneity of ionization structure .",
    "even current numerical simulations can not resolve such a wide dynamic range .",
    "for that reason , in this work , we semi - analytically investigate the cosmic reionization and galaxy formation based on simple structure formation models and radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we use the cosmological parameters , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our models of star formation and hii bubbles in  2 . in  3 , we present the results , which include the @xmath0 properties , lfs of laes and redshift evolution of number density of laes .",
    "we discuss the relation between the @xmath0 flux of galaxies and the sizes of hii bubbles in  5 , and summarize in  6 .",
    "in the current standard picture of structure formation , halos grow via minor / major mergers . in our model , the star formation rate ( sfr ) in a halo",
    "is assumed to be proportional to the growth rate of the halo as follows : @xmath22 the relation between stellar and halo mass can be written as @xmath23 .",
    "the abundance matching analysis by @xcite indicated that @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed the weak dependence of @xmath26 on halo mass and redshift at the mass range @xmath27 , although @xmath26 increases with @xmath13 at @xmath28 ( see also , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore we here assume @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we estimate sfr from the growth rate of halo mass with a constant tuning parameter @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 . in order to estimate the growth of halos , we use halo merger trees based on an extended press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "the halo merger trees include 5000 realizations with the halo mass range of @xmath32 at @xmath33 . in this work ,",
    "we allow star formation only for halos with the mass @xmath34 , because star formation in less massive halos can be significantly suppressed due to uv background or internal stellar feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in deriving statistical properties , e.g. , cosmic sfr density , stellar mass density and lf",
    ", we sum the contribution of each merger tree with normalization factors that reproduce the halo mass function of @xcite .",
    "we determine the tuning parameter by using observed cosmic sfr density and stellar mass density at @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr ] shows our modeled sfr and stellar mass density with observations .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath30 by the least square fitting to the four points of the observations . the observed sfr and stellar mass densities consider only galaxies with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we consider only the galaxies satisfying the above criteria for the fitting .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath38 .",
    "note that , so far there is no available data about @xmath39 at @xmath40 and @xmath30 can change with halo mass and redshift .",
    "however , for simplicity , we assume @xmath30 is constant . following the above way",
    ", we derive star formation history from each halo merger tree .",
    "we also derive uv lfs by converting sfr to uv flux with @xmath41 @xcite",
    ". figure  [ fig : lbg ] shows our modeled lfs at @xmath2 and @xmath42 with those from the recent observation by @xcite .",
    "the observation indicated that a part of uv flux are absorbed by dust with the escape fraction @xmath43 .",
    "our modeled lfs match the observation well with the same uv escape fraction .",
    "galaxies ionize the igm as star formation proceeds . in a one - zone approximation , we estimate time evolution of cosmic ionization degree @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the volume fraction of hii , @xmath46 is the present - day hydrogen number density ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 is the intrinsic ionizing photon emissivity per unit volume , @xmath49 is the case - b recombination rate , @xmath50 is a clumpiness factor of igm , and @xmath51 is escape fraction of ionizing photons , which is a free parameter here .",
    "we estimate @xmath48 from star formation history of each halo by using starburst99 with the salpeter initial mass function with the metallicity of @xmath52 .",
    "the reionization history is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : tau ] . as @xmath51 increases",
    ", the igm is ionized earlier .",
    "we assume the recombination rate for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 , as suggested by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the cosmic reionization history is regulated by @xmath51 .",
    "free electrons produced by the cosmic reionization contribute to the thomson scattering optical depth ( @xmath56 ) of cmb photons , defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the redshift at the time of recombination . in this work",
    ", we assume the single ionization fraction of helium is the same as the one for hydrogen at @xmath59 , and the double ionization takes place at @xmath60 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent simulations show that indeed the fraction of heii is close to the hii fraction at high redshifts , although the ionization fraction of helium is slightly lower than the one for hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : tau ] represents the ionization history of hydrogen gas with the different @xmath51 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : tau ] shows @xmath56 with different @xmath51 .",
    "the thomson scattering optical depth @xmath56 increases with redshift in a way depending on @xmath51 due to the different ionization histories .",
    "we find @xmath61 nicely reproduces the cmb observation ( planck 2016 ) .",
    "therefore , in this work , we adopt @xmath61 with no redshift evolution . in fact , @xcite showed @xmath51 is constant with redshift and @xmath62 by cosmological simulations with radiative transfer calculations .    .",
    "our model also consider only the galaxies brighter than the same limiting magnitude .",
    "lower panel : stellar mass density .",
    "red line is the cumulated stellar mass of our model considering only the galaxies with @xmath37 .",
    "triangle symbols show the observation by @xcite , who integrated the derived stellar mass functions for galaxies with @xmath37 . ]     and @xmath42 by @xcite . ]",
    "we follow the growth history of hii bubbles around individual galaxies with the star formation efficiency @xmath30 and @xmath51 estimated above .",
    "sizes of hii bubbles evolve with ionizing photon emissions , recombination , and cosmic expansion as follows @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hubble constant at specific redshifts , and @xmath65 is intrinsic ionizng photon emissivity of each galaxy .",
    "the ionizing fronts can propagate up to the str@xmath66mgren radius during the recombination time scale @xcite .",
    "the recombination time scale is @xmath67 , which is longer than the typical time scale over which sfr changes more than factor @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , hii bubbles do not reach the equilibrium state , and we need to consider sfr history to estimate the sizes of hii bubbles at given redshifts .",
    "we estimate probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the sizes of ionized bubbles ( @xmath69 ) as shown in figure  [ fig : rhii_hist ] . in our model ,",
    "higher mass halos tend to possess larger ionized bubbles .",
    "due to the decrease in the number density of halos on the high - mass end of a halo mass function @xcite , the pdf of @xmath69 rapidly decreases at larger @xmath69 .",
    "although the ionizing front does not reach the size of str@xmath66mgren sphere @xmath70 , it can be used as a rough indicator of sizes of hii bubbles . as redshift decreases , the igm density decreases while the number density of massive halos with higher ionizing photon emissivity increases .",
    "therefore , the tail of pdf in the large-@xmath69 end shifts to larger @xmath69 at lower redshift .",
    "future 21 cm observations , e.g. , ska-2 , is supposed to probe the igm ionization structure with the angular resolution of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath72 , the tail of pdf at large @xmath69 can be observationally investigated in future .",
    "the halo number density monotonically increases as the halo mass decreases at a fixed redshift . since the size of hii bubble",
    "is positively related with halo mass as will be shown in section 3.3 , it seems that the pdfs in the small-@xmath69 end monotonically increase as @xmath69 decreases",
    ". however , there are peaks in the pdfs , below which they decrease as @xmath69 decreases .",
    "this is caused by the threshold of halo mass for star formation imposed in this work .",
    "absorption of ionizing photons by interstellar medium within galaxies results in @xmath0 emissions via recombination processes , while escaped photons cause the cosmic reionization as shown in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath73 ) is estimated by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons from galaxies , @xmath76 is the energy of a @xmath0 photon .",
    "the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons @xmath75 can be lower than @xmath77 because the path length of @xmath0 photons until escape can be longer due to multiple scattering process .",
    "however , if dust mainly distributes in hi gas clumps , @xmath75 does not become lower than @xmath77 because @xmath0 photons are scattered by hydrogen on surface of the clumps before interacting with dust .",
    "@xcite indicated that @xmath78 for observed laes at @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , cosmological simulations of @xcite showed that @xmath75 was @xmath80 and similar to @xmath77 at @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , in this work , we assume that @xmath82 .",
    "next , we estimate igm transmission as a function of wavelength . as in @xcite",
    ", we divide the paths along which @xmath0 photons travel from galaxies to us into the two parts , i.e. , outside and inside ionized bubbles , and separately estimate each contribution .",

    "the @xmath89 is estimated by @xcite @xmath92 = 1.041 \\times 10^{-13 } \\left ( \\frac{t}{10^{4 } ~\\rm k}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\frac{h(x , a)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}.\\ ] ] we set @xmath53 in this work . here",
    ", @xmath93 is the voigt function , @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the line - center frequency , @xmath97 is the doppler width , @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the natural line width .",
    "we here use the fitting formula of @xmath93 given by @xcite .    even inside ionized bubbles , a tiny fraction of neutral hydrogens exist .",
    "we estimate the igm transmission from ionizing front to virial radius with the neutral fraction under the ionization equilibrium state , @xmath100 note that , the optical depth outside the ionized bubble is dominant in our work .",
    "the igm transmission is mostly almost zero at @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the wavelength of @xmath0 line center .    considering the igm transmission , we derive @xmath0 lfs , and compare them with the observation of @xcite . depending on the shape of @xmath0 line profile , the igm transmission significantly changes .",
    "even with recent deep spectroscopies , however , it is difficult to determine intrinsic @xmath0 line profiles , i.e. , before the igm extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath0 line profile depends on the physical nature of galaxies , e.g. , hi column density and velocity field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we calculate intrinsic @xmath0 line profiles by @xmath0 radiation transfer simulations using the code developed in @xcite , and study the physical nature of laes through the comparison with the observation @xcite . the intrinsic line profiles are calculated based on spherically outflowing gas cloud models with the following velocity structure , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the edge of the spherical cloud and @xmath105 is the outflow velocity at @xmath104 .",
    "although the simulated profiles do not depend on @xmath104 , here we consider @xmath106 .",
    "figure  [ fig : inprof ] shows the modeled line profiles with various outflowing velocities .",
    "the @xmath0 line profiles get the asymmetric shape with a peak at redder wavelength for the outflow velocity field , because @xmath0 photons at bluer wavelength are scattered by hi gas due to the doppler shift .",
    "as @xmath107 increases , the line profiles are extended , and the peak frequency shift farther from the line center frequency .",
    "for the inflow velocity field , the @xmath0 line profile becomes the mirror symmetric shape to the one for outflow with the same absolute value of the velocity .        with the simulated intrinsic line profiles",
    ", we can estimate @xmath0 lfs for given @xmath107 and @xmath105 . in this work , we infer typical @xmath107 and @xmath105 of laes by comparing modeled lfs with the observed one by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lflae ] show the lfs . here",
    "we calculate the lfs for three hi column density models , @xmath108 ( model a ) , @xmath109 ( model b ) , and @xmath110 ( model c ) .",
    "the column density of model a is corresponding to damped lyman-@xmath30 systems ( dlas : * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that dlas distributed at lines of sight passing star - forming regions in high - redshift star - forming galaxies by combining cosmological sph simulations with radiation transfer calculations .",
    "these column densities are optically thick to ionizing photons , hence not consistent with @xmath61 .",
    "however , recent simulations showed ionizing photons mostly escape along ionized holes created by radiative and sne feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , @xmath51 of 20 @xmath111 can be considered as the fraction of viewing angle along which star forming regions are not covered by hi gas . for simplicity , we do not take account of the effect of such holes on line profiles . note",
    "that , however , @xmath0 line profiles somewhat change due to the holes , clumpiness or other detailed structure in hi gas @xcite .",
    "the shaded regions in figure  [ fig : lflae ] represent the lfs using different @xmath0 line profiles with the velocity range from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "the best fit velocities are @xmath114 ( model a ) , @xmath115 ( model b ) , and @xmath116 ( model c ) , as summarized in table  [ table : model ] . only model a with the velocity range @xmath117 can reproduce the observed lf well .",
    "therefore we suggest laes are likely to have high hi column density with @xmath118 and outflowing hi gas with velocity @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath0 profile monotonically shifts to redder one as the outflow velocity increases in model a as shown in figure  [ fig : inprof ] . on the other hand , as the hi column density decreases , the @xmath0 profile moves back to the line center frequency at specific velocity of @xmath120 .",
    "this is because @xmath0 photons can escape from the cloud before shifting to longer wavelength due to lower optical depth . in this work ,",
    "the best fit velocities for model b and c roughly correspond to those producing the @xmath0 profiles shifted farthest away .",
    "in addition , the width of line profile becomes smaller as the hi column density decrease .",
    "even with the best fit velocities , the number densities of laes in the model b and c are smaller than the observation because of the narrower line profiles resulting in lower igm transmission .",
    "hence , in order to get higher igm transmission to reproduce the lf , laes are likely to have the column density higher than @xmath121 .",
    "thus , in this work , we consider model a as our fiducial model .",
    "emergent @xmath0 line profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : prof ] . as hi",
    "column density decreases , intrinsic @xmath0 line profiles become narrower and peak positions shift to shorter wavelength .",
    "igm transmission increases with wavelength because photons with long wavelength redshift early to avoid from being scattered by the igm , while @xmath0 flux near the line center is reduced efficiently by the igm scattering .",
    "fwhms of the emergent line profiles are @xmath122 ( model a ) , @xmath123 ( model b ) and @xmath124 ( model c ) .",
    "therefore it is difficult to distinguish the different column density models in the current spectroscopic observation with the resolution of @xmath125 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "future high - dispersion spectroscopies with @xmath126 , e.g. , prime focus spectrograph on subaru or jwst , will be able to reveal the detailed shape of profile .",
    "line profiles in inflowing gas models result in the underproduction of observable laes , because most of @xmath0 photons are scattered by the igm .",
    "this is consistent with the observation by @xcite , which indicated laes at @xmath127 are likely to have outflowing gas by the composite spectrum . in addition , @xcite measured outflow velocities of individual laes at @xmath79 , and indicated that laes were likely to have outflow with @xmath128 .",
