    "in the last decade , special attention has been paid to starless cores or prestellar cores in dark clouds in order to investigate initial conditions of protostellar collapse . since the detection of infalling motion in a prestellar core l1544 in the taurus molecular cloud @xcite , a number of observational studies on l1544 and similar prestellar cores such as l1498 in the taurus molecular cloud have been carried out with molecular lines and dust continuum emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one of the most interesting features found in l1498 and l1544 is an evidence of molecular depletion in the central part of the cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both observational and theoretical studies reveal that abundances of co , cs , and ccs are depleted in the chemically evolved cores , while nh@xmath0 and n@xmath4h@xmath3 are not @xcite .",
    "these studies have promoted understanding of chemical properties as well as kinematics of evolved prestellar cores just under the collapsing phase .",
    "although detailed studies on evolved prestellar cores were extensively carried out , no systematic studies on younger cores have been made for a long time , except for tmc-1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is because most of dense cores observed in the previous studies were based on the catalog of @xcite , which are prepared by the nh@xmath0 observations . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite pointed out that nh@xmath0 is not always a good tracer of dense cores because of the chemical abundance variation from core to core .",
    "they found anticorrelation between abundances of nh@xmath0 and carbon - chain - molecules such as ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n , and identified a few starless cores where the carbon - chain molecules are abundant while nh@xmath0 is deficient .",
    "they are l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 , and are called `` carbon - chain  producing regions '' .",
    "chemical model calculations suggest that the carbon - chain  producing regions are in the early stage of chemical evolution while dense cores traced by the nh@xmath0 lines are rather evolved @xcite .    in order to investigate basic physical and chemical properties of carbon - chain  producing regions",
    ", we carried out detailed observations of l1521e @xcite , l1495b and l1521b @xcite .",
    "for each of these three regions , we found a compact dense core traced by the h@xmath6co@xmath3 , ccs , c@xmath0s , and hc@xmath0n lines and their distributions have a single peak at the same position .",
    "such a distribution is different from those in evolved prestellar cores , l1498 and l1544 .",
    "in addition , abundances of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath4h@xmath3 are extremely lower in these three regions than in other prestellar cores , while those of carbon - chain - molecules are systematically higher . according to our survey of deuterated molecules , deuterium fractionation ratios of dnc / hnc and dco@xmath3/hco@xmath3 are systematically lower in l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e than in the other dark cores @xcite .",
    "these features suggest that l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e would be in the early stage of dynamical and chemical evolution , and the degree of depletion of molecules is possibly lower than in other evolved cores @xcite .    although detailed studies on carbon - chain  producing regions are important for understanding of chemical and physical evolution of dense cores , only four carbon - chain  producing regions were identified in taurus molecular cloud . in order to search for carbon - chain  producing regions outside the taurus molecular cloud",
    ", we carried out a survey of ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n toward 31 dark cloud cores . as a result , we detected a possible candidate for another carbon - chain  producing region l492 in the aquila rift ( hirota et al . in preparation ) .",
    "l492 is one of the prestellar cores identified as a strong infalling candidate @xcite , and it is observed with the dust continuum emission as well as the n@xmath4d@xmath3 and n@xmath4h@xmath3 lines @xcite . in this paper , we report on the results of extensive molecular line observations of l492 .",
    "we carried out molecular line observations of l492 with the 45 m radio telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) in february 2003 and march 2004 .",
    "the observed lines are summarized in table [ tab - observe ] .",
    "we used cooled hemt receivers for the lines in the 22 - 23 ghz band , sis mixer receivers for the lines in the 45 - 48 ghz and 72 - 96 ghz bands , the sis 25-beam array receiver system ( bears ) for the @xmath6co and c@xmath7o lines in the 109 - 110 ghz band .",
    "the main - beam efficiencies ( @xmath8 ) were 0.8 , 0.7 , 0.5 , and 0.5 for the 22 - 23 ghz , 45 - 49 ghz , 72 - 96 ghz , and 109 - 110 ghz bands , respectively .",
    "the beam sizes were 73 , 36 , 20 , and 16   for the 22 - 23 ghz , 45 - 49 ghz , 72 - 96 ghz , and 109 - 110 ghz bands , respectively .",
    "acousto - optical radio spectrometers with the frequency resolution of 37 khz were used for the backend except for the @xmath6co and c@xmath7o observations , in which autocorrelators with the frequency resolution of 31.25 khz were used .",
    "we took the reference position of l492 to be @xmath9 , @xmath104613@xcite .",
    "observations in the 22 - 23 ghz and 45 - 49 ghz bands were performed in the position - switching mode .",
    "the off position was taken to be 10  away from the source position , which is outside the core of l492 with the radius of 3.2@xcite .",
    "observations in the 72 - 96 ghz and 109 - 110 ghz bands were performed in the frequency switching mode with the frequency offset was set to be 7.685 mhz .",
    "the grid spacing in the mapping observations was taken to be 40 - 80 , 40 , and 20  for the 22 - 23 ghz , 45 - 49 ghz , and 72 - 96 ghz bands , respectively , as shown in figure [ fig - maps ] .",
    "since the beam separation of the bears is 41.1 , the grid spacing of the @xmath6co and c@xmath7o maps were taken to be 20.55 .",
    "note that we did not carry out the niquist sampling because of limited observing time .",
    "pointing was checked by observing a nearby sio maser source , r - aql , every 1 - 2 hours , and the pointing accuracy was estimated to be better than 5 .",
    "the antenna temperature was calibrated by a usual chopper - wheel method .",
    "figure [ fig - maps ] shows the integrated intensity maps , and figures [ fig - spectr]-[fig - spnh3 ] show an example of the observed spectrum for each molecule .",
    "we only show the maps of the lines marked in table [ tab - observe ] .",
    "the molecular gas is distributed along the north - south ridge traced by the @xmath6co and c@xmath7o lines , and the dense core of l492 traced by other lines is located at the southern edge of the ridge .",
    "most of the maps show quite similar structure with a single peak and a simple elliptical shape with the average diameter of 100 , corresponding to 0.1 pc at the distance of 200 pc @xcite . although the peak positions are different from each other , this is partly due to the different beam size and grid spacing .",
    "the single peak distribution of the c@xmath5s and ccs in l492 clearly contrasts with the double peak distribution in l1498 and l1544 @xcite , and is rather similar to the distribution in the carbon - chain  producing regions such as l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e @xcite .",
    "the peak position of the n@xmath4h@xmath3 map is 20  south of those of the dust continuum , n@xmath4d@xmath3 , and n@xmath4h@xmath3 maps reported by @xcite , probably due to insufficient spatial resolution or coarse grid spacing .",
    "on the other hand , we found a marginal double peak structure in the maps of the @xmath11=1 - 0 line of h@xmath6co@xmath3 and the @xmath12-@xmath13 line of ccs , although the northern peak has the statistical significance of only 2 @xmath14 level .",
    "because the optical depth of the @xmath11=1 - 0 line of h@xmath6co@xmath3 and the @xmath12-@xmath13 line of ccs are 0.82 and 0.54 , respectively , as discussed later , they would not be suffered from self - absorption .",
    "a possible explanation is depletion of h@xmath6co@xmath3 and ccs in the central part of the core .",
    "note that the double peak structure is not evident in the ccs @xmath15-@xmath16 map as mentioned above .",
    "since the critical density for the @xmath12-@xmath13 line is higher than that of the @xmath15-@xmath16 line , we could detect the depletion of ccs only with the @xmath12-@xmath13 line .",
    "if the double peak structure is real , the depletion of molecules would have just started at the central part of l492 , which can be seen only in the @xmath12-@xmath13 line of ccs and the @xmath11=1 - 0 line of h@xmath6co@xmath3 .",
    "further high resolution observations would be necessary to confirm this .",
    "it is interesting to compare the deuterium fractionation ratio within the dense core , because the deuterium fractionation ratio reflects chemical evolutionary stage and degree of depletion @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig - dhratio ] shows the integrated intensity ratios of dco@xmath3/h@xmath6co@xmath3 and dnc / hn@xmath6c as a function of the distance from the dust continuum peak . because these lines are optically thin as discussed later , the integrated intensity ratios approximately represent the abundance ratios .",
    "the maximum dco@xmath3/h@xmath6co@xmath3 and dnc / hn@xmath6c ratios are 1.6 and 2.2 , respectively , and their positions are offset from the dco@xmath3 and dnc peaks and also from the dust continuum peak .",
    "the deuterium fractionation ratios are not significantly enhanced in the central part of the core .",
    "we might be able to see an only slight increase in the dco@xmath3/h@xmath6co@xmath3 ratio within the inner 40  area .",
    "however , this is not so clear as in the case of l1544 @xcite . as for the dnc / hn@xmath6c ratio ,",
    "such an enhancement is not seen , being consistent with other cores @xcite .",
    "we also investigate velocity structure of the core using the ccs ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) line , because this line has no hyperfine splitting and was observed with a relatively high velocity resolution ( 0.136 km s@xmath17 ) .",
    "figures [ fig - ccs81chmap2 ] and [ fig - l492-pv ] show the channel maps and position - velocity diagrams of the ccs(@xmath12-@xmath13 ) line , respectively .",
    "we found a global velocity gradient of 3 km s@xmath17 pc@xmath17 in the east - west direction across the core . on the other hand",
    ", we could not find other significant change in the linewidth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite , the optically thick line , cs(@xmath11=2 - 1 ) , toward l492 has the asymmetric line profile due to an infalling motion .",
    "however , either double peak or asymmetric line profiles are not detected in our observations because we observed only optically thin lines .      in order to evaluate abundances of the observed molecules ,",
    "line parameters for all the observed lines were determined by the gaussian fit , as summarized in table [ tab - observe ] .",
    "we ignored unresolved hyperfine structures of the nh@xmath0 and hc@xmath0n lines , and hence , their linewidths are shown to be broader than the others .",
    "the parameters at the ( 0 , 0 ) position for nh@xmath0 and hc@xmath2n ( 22 - 23 ghz band ) , the ( 40,0 ) position for other carbon - chain molecules ( 22 - 23 ghz , 45 - 49 ghz and 81 - 96 ghz bands ) , and the ( 20 , 20 ) position for the rest ( 72 - 93 ghz and 109 - 110 ghz bands ) are listed in table [ tab - observe ] .",
    "these positions correspond to the peak positions of the integrated intensity map for each molecule . using these line parameters , we calculated the column densities of the observed molecules by the consistent way employed in previous works ( e.g. suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ; hirota et al . 1998 , 2001 , 2002 , 2004 ) in order to compare the present results with those for l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and tmc-1 .",
    "the methods are briefly described below , and the results are summarized in tables [ tab - lvg ] and [ tab - lte ] .",
    "the references for collision rates and dipole moments are also summarized in tables [ tab - lvg ] and [ tab - lte ] . in the analysis , the kinetic temperature in l492",
    "is assumed to be 10 k , which was derived from the nh@xmath0 lines in the present study .",
    "because we observed molecular lines with the different grid spacing depending on the beam size , we can not compare the line parameters and column densities of all the observed molecules at the same position .",
    "therefore , we list the line parameters and molecular column densities at the above positions .",
    "although the peak positions are different from each other , this is partly due to the different beam size and grid spacing .",
    "therefore , the column densities for the positions listed in tables [ tab - lvg ] and [ tab - lte ] would be those for the same volume of gas . according to our maps shown in figure [ fig - maps ] ,",
    "the difference in the integrated intensities due to the position difference is less than 20% , and hence , the uncertainty in the column densities due to the position difference is estimated to be 20% .",
    "we derived the column density of c@xmath5s and the h@xmath4 density using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model @xcite .",
    "the method is the same as that adopted in @xcite .",
    "we ignored the difference in the beam sizes between the @xmath11=1 - 0 and 2 - 1 lines in the analysis .",
    "because the core size of l492 ( 100 ) is sufficiently larger than the beam sizes for the @xmath11=1 - 0 ( 36 ) and @xmath11=2 - 1 line ( 20 ) , this approximation does not seriously affect the results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the h@xmath4 density is derived to be 9.0@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "we derived the column density of ccs and the h@xmath4 density using the lvg model .",
    "because the beam size of the @xmath21=@xmath22-@xmath23 lines are as large as the core size , beam dilution effect would be significant , and hence , we only used the results of the @xmath21=@xmath15-@xmath16 and @xmath21=@xmath12-@xmath13 lines . for these lines , we ignored the difference in the beam sizes of the two transitions , as in the case of the c@xmath5s analysis .",
    "the h@xmath4 density is derived to be 6.8@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "for comparison , we carried out lte analysis assuming the excitation temperature of 5 k @xcite . in this case ,",
    "column density of ccs is three times larger than that derived from the lvg analysis .",
    "therefore , the column densities of ccs for other cores obtained by the lte analysis , in which the excitation temperature is fixed to 5 k , would be overestimated . in this paper ,",
    "the lte value is employed for consistency with previous results .",
    "we derived the column densities of dco@xmath3 , dnc , h@xmath6co@xmath3 , and hn@xmath6c by the lvg calculations .",
    "the method is described in @xcite . because we did not carry out multi - transition observations for these molecules",
    ", we assumed the h@xmath4 density to be 9.0@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath20 , which is derived from the c@xmath5s data .",
    "if we assume the h@xmath4 density to be 2.0@xmath1810@xmath24 @xmath20 @xcite , the column densities of dco@xmath3 and h@xmath6co@xmath3 decrease by 10 - 25% , while those of dnc and hn@xmath6c decrease by a factor of 2 . in both case , the dco@xmath3/h@xmath6co@xmath3 and dnc / hn@xmath6c ratios change by less than 10% .",
    "the column densities of @xmath6co and c@xmath7o were derived by assuming the @xmath6co / c@xmath7o ratio of the local ism value , 7.3 @xcite , and the common excitation temperature .",
    "the excitation temperature was determined to be 8.3 k.      at first , we carried out the lvg analysis using the @xmath11=5 - 4 and 9 - 8 lines to derive the column density of hc@xmath0n and the h@xmath4 density .",
    "however , the fitting did not converge probably because of the large optical depth of the @xmath11=5 - 4 line . because the satellite hyperfine component of the @xmath11=5 - 4 line is clearly detected as shown in figure [ fig - sphc3n ]",
    ", we can determine the optical depth and the excitation temperature of the @xmath11=5 - 4 line of hc@xmath0n .",
    "the total optical depth and the excitation temperature were calculated to be 8.8 and 6.4 k , respectively .",
    "the excitation temperature determined here is consistent with that employed by @xcite , 6.5 k. then we determined the column density of hc@xmath0n from the total optical depth assuming the lte condition with the excitation temperature of 6.4 k.      for c@xmath0s , hc@xmath1n , and hc@xmath2n , we determined their column densities by the consistent way adopted in the previous literatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assumed that the excitation temperatures of 5.5 k for c@xmath0s , 6.5 k for hc@xmath1n , and 10.0k for hc@xmath2n .",
    "since all the hyperfine components of the n@xmath4h@xmath3 line are detected as shown in figure [ fig - spn2hp ] , we were able to determine the optical depth and the excitation temperature of n@xmath4h@xmath3 to be 6.1 and 4.9 k , respectively .",
    "the excitation temperature determined here is consistent with those reported by @xcite , 5 k. then we derived the column density of n@xmath4h@xmath3 assuming the lte condition with the excitation temperature of 4.9 k.      using the intensity ratios of hyperfine components of the ( 1,1 ) lines , we derived the excitation temperature to be 4.1 k. in addition , we determined the rotation temperature of the para nh@xmath0 to be 9.5@xmath25 k by the methods described in @xcite",
    ". thus , we calculated the column density of nh@xmath0 assuming the lte condition with the rotation temperature of 10 k and the ortho - to - para ratio of 1 .",
    "the column densities of the observed molecules are summarized in table [ tab - column ] . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding column densities in the carbon - chain  producing regions are also listed in table [ tab - column ] .",
    "the column densities of the carbon - chain molecules in l492 are significantly higher than those in typical dark cloud cores @xcite and are comparable to those in the carbon - chain  producing regions such as l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and tmc-1 . since the carbon - chain  producing regions have so far been recognized in the taurus molecular cloud , l492 is the first dark cloud core with extremely high abundances of carbon - chain - molecules that is found outside the taurus molecular cloud . on the other hand ,",
    "the column densities of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath4h@xmath3 in l492 are higher than those in the carbon - chain  producing regions , and are comparable to those in typical dark cloud cores @xcite .",
    "we stress that the column densities in l492 are almost comparable to those of tmc-1 for most of the observed molecules , except for the slightly high column density of nh@xmath0 and the low column densities of sulfur - bearing carbon - chain molecules and hc@xmath2n .",
    "thus the chemical composition in l492 is close to that of tmc-1 .    in order to discuss chemical evolutionary stages of l492 and other starless cores",
    ", we summarize the selected molecular abundance ratios which are thought to be used as a chemical clock , as shown in table [ tab - ratio ] .",
    "the most popular indicator is the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio of 6.5 in l492 is intermediate between those of carbon - chain  producing regions ( 2.6 - 3.8 ) and evolved prestellar core such as l1498 and l1544 ( 15 - 25 ) . for consistency , we employed the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios in l1498 and l1544 reported by @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are quite large due to difference in telescope beam sizes , observed positions , and methods of data analysis .",
    "in fact , different values are reported by @xcite ( 14 - 25 and 9.0 for l1498 and l1544 , respectively ) .",
    "if we use the result of the lvg calculations for the column density of ccs , the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio in l492 is 21 , which is larger by a factor of 3 than that of the lte value .",
    "even such uncertainties are considered , we can say that the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio in l492 is intermediate or close to those of l1498 and l1544 rather than those in carbon - chain  producing regions .",
    "another good indicator for chemical evolutionary stage is a deuterium fractionation ratio .",
    "because deuterium fractionation proceeds through the exothermic isotope exchange reaction of h@xmath26 and hd in the gas - phase , the h@xmath4d@xmath3/h@xmath26 ratio gradually increase with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , depletion of molecules make the life time of h@xmath4d@xmath3 longer , resulting in a high deuterium fractionation ratio of h@xmath4d@xmath3/h@xmath26 .",
    "consequently , a deuterium fractionation ratio is thought to be enhanced in evolved cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deuterium fractionation ratio , dnc / hn@xmath6c , of 1.27 in l492 is comparable to those of the carbon - chain  producing regions ( 0.66 - 1.25 ) , and is smaller than those in l1498 ( 1.91 ) and l1544 ( 3.0 ) .",
    "the dco@xmath3/h@xmath6co@xmath3 ratio of 0.80 is also comparable to those of the carbon - chain  producing regions ( 0.63 - 1.10 ) and smaller than those in l1498 ( 2.7 ) and l1544 ( 3.1 - 9.2 ) .",
    "the lower dco@xmath3/h@xmath6co@xmath3 ratio in l492 suggests that molecular depletion is not very significant in comparison with l1544 @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath4d@xmath3/n@xmath4h@xmath3 ratio of 0.05 in l492 is comparable to that in l1498 ( 0.04 ) , while it is lower than in l1544 ( 0.23 ) @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that chemical evolutionary stage of l492 would be younger than those of l1498 and l1544 , and molecules would be less depleted in l492 than in l1498 and l1544 .",
    "recently , discussions considering both dynamical and chemical evolution of dense cores have been reported @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we summarize the evolutionary stages of l492 and other starless cores on the basis of signature of dynamical collapse , degree of depletion , and molecular abundance ratios , as shown in table [ tab - scenario ] . as already reported",

    "we propose the following scenario for chemical and dynamical evolution . at the initial state of dense cores before protostellar collapse , such as l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and tmc-1 , abundances of carbon - chain molecules are extremely high because of high abundance of the neutral carbon atom @xcite . on the other hand , nh@xmath0 and n@xmath4h@xmath3 are not yet abundant because they are produced by slow chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the deuterium fractionation in these cores are not enhanced because of the low h@xmath4d@xmath3/h@xmath26 ratio at the earliest stage of chemical evolution , and also because of a low degree of depletion of co , cs , ccs , and other molecules @xcite . as a core evolves ,",

    "it is also likely that timescales of gas - phase chemical evolution , freeze - out of molecules onto grains , and dynamical collapse are different from region to region ( e.g. taurus and aquila rift ) . for example , @xcite and @xcite classified three types of prestellar cores ; chemically evolved and dynamically young cores ( l1512 , l1498 ) , chemically evolved and dynamically evolved cores ( l1544 ) , and chemically young and dynamically evolved cores ( l1689b ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that l1689b , which is in the ophiuchus region , has the different environment from those of l1512 and l1544 in the taurus region .",
    "it should be noted that l492 is also a chemically young and dynamically evolved core outside the taurus region . in order to understand this regional difference , further systematic observational studies and theoretical modeling",
    "would be needed .",
