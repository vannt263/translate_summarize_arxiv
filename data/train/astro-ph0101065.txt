    "recently , workers analyzing the rgs data of the luminous ( @xmath8 ) nearby ( @xmath9=0.0078 ) seyfert 1 galaxy 6 and the similar object mrk  766 have proposed a radical alternative to the warm absorber model as the origin of the spectral features in the soft ( @xmath10 2  kev ) band ( branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter br2001 ) .",
    "it had been generally accepted that the features were imposed by partially ionized absorbing material at @xmath7 parsec distances from the black hole .",
    "the main signatures are strong and absorption edges ( e.g. fabian et al . 1994 ) , which are nearly ubiquitous in seyfert  1 galaxies ( e.g. reynolds 1997 , george et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , br2001 propose that in 6 and mrk  766 the observed spectral features are soft x - ray emission lines from close to the black hole highly broadened by relativistic effects .",
    "this scenario is invoked to explain the apparent 16,000 @xmath1 redshifted edge without associated resonance lines .",
    "our high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) observation does not support this interpretation .",
    "we present strong evidence for partially ionized absorbing material along the line of sight .",
    "in particular , we find absorption lines from a myriad of species in a range of ionization states which can explain the observed spectral rollover at the energies of the warm absorber .",
    "we demonstrate that the apparent redshifted edge can be explained by the @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 ) resonance lines and a complex of fe  l edges , plausibly from dust in the ionized absorber . here",
    "we concentrate on this evidence and leave more comprehensive analyses to subsequent publications .",
    "mcg@xmath136 - 30 - 15 was observed with the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ; canizares 2001 ) from 2000 april 56 , and again from 2000 august 2122 .",
    "the total integration time was @xmath5  120  ks .",
    "we reduce the spectral data from l1 ( raw unfiltered event ) files using idl processing scripts which are similar to the standard ciao processing .",
    "a more complete description is in marshall , schulz , & canizares ( 2001 ) .",
    "we restrict the event list to the nominal ( 0,2,3,4,6 ) grade set , and remove event streaks in the s4 chip ( these are not related to the readout streak ) .",
    "event energies are corrected for detector node - to - node gain variations .",
    "the zeroth order position is determined and the @xmath14 order events are extracted for source and background regions .",
    "bad columns are eliminated , as well as data which are affected by detector gaps .",
    "we bin the meg ( heg ) events at 0.01  ( 0.005 ) intervals ( an acis pixel ) for analysis .",
    "the instrument effective area is based on pre - flight calibration data .",
    "the spectrum shows many features including numerous unresolved absorption lines . the continuum exhibits a soft excess and a deficit from 0.7  kev ( 17.7   ) to @xmath5 2 kev ( 6.2   ) , features long attributed to a multi - zone warm absorber ( e.g. reynolds et al .",
    "1995 , otani et al .",
    "our simultaneous data show the well - studied power law and relativistically broadened iron line ( e.g. tanaka et al . 1995 ) , and will be reported separately .",

    "kev ) heg data simultaneously obtaining @xmath15 for the time - averaged ( 120  ks ) spectrum .",
    "the meg energies @xmath16  kev are excluded from our fits in order to mitigate the effect of the excess absorption in that energy range ; the fe  k region is also excluded .",
    "( this is consistent with the best fit @xmath17  kev @xmath18 . )",
    "the source varied by @xmath550% during each observation . correlated continuum flux and line strength variations were noted by otani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with .",
    "accordingly , we separated our data into ` high ' and ` low ' states arbitrarily defined as above and below our mean 2 @xmath19 .",
    "we concentrate our study of the warm absorber on the high state because many of the oxygen resonance absorption lines appear most prominent during this state .",
    "a strong testament to the existence of the warm absorber is the myriad of ionized species in the 0.51  kev range , and in particular resonance lines from n  vii , o  ( vii , viii ) , ne  ( ix , x ) , fe  xvii to fe  xxi ( fig .",
    "[ fig - waregion]a ) .",
    "there are also many absorption lines of higher ionization states of fe up to fe  xxiii , mg , si , s , ar , and possibly ca dispersed through the 0.95  kev bandpass .",
    "these lines , and the associated edges can plausibly account for the observed spectral ` rollover ' @xmath02 kev .    of particular note",
    "are the resonance lines @xmath20 and  ly@xmath21 , ly@xmath22 .",
    "we detect @xmath11 up to @xmath3 with confidence levels from 95% to 99.9% .",
    "these lines , like all the absorption lines discussed in this paper are unresolved ( implying fwhm @xmath0  200 @xmath1 ) , and at the expected wavelengths to within @xmath23 ( @xmath10 0.01   ) which is within the hetg calibration uncertainty . the equivalent widths in the high state for @xmath24=2 , 4 ,",

    "clearly these lines are on the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "we performed a curve - of - growth analysis for trial sets of the parameters turbulent velocity @xmath27 and column @xmath28 ( using the program described in pettini et al .",
    "1983 , mar & bailey 1995 ) and find the minimum column density implied by the absorption lines is @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) which requires an optical depth @xmath31 at the edge ( daltabuit & cox 1972 ) . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig - waregion]a shows an edge at 0.74  kev ( 16.8   ) , the energy expected for at rest in the agn frame .",
    "the drop across the edge implies @xmath32 , or @xmath33 , which can account for the observed strengths of the absorption series for @xmath34 , consistent with the lines being unresolved in our data .",
    "the edge is not strong in our data ( @xmath35 ) . and is complicated by a complex of nearby lines from fe  xvii and fe  xviii species as well as the ne  ix @xmath36 resonance feature ( e.g. nicastro et al . 1999 ) shown in fig .  [ fig - waregion]a .",
    "we find consistency between the ly@xmath21 and ly@xmath22 equivalent widths ( respectively @xmath37  m[0.79  ev ] and @xmath38  m[0.92  ev ] ) , and edge for @xmath39 , or @xmath40 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we now investigate the strong drop at @xmath5  0.7  kev ( if this is the edge , then its redshift is @xmath41 - e.g. br2001 ) , and spectral features which govern the complex of lines by computing line strengths for the ( @xmath42 ) resonance series .",
    "we use the line list of verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the @xmath43 oscillator strengths and wavelengths , and extrapolate using the hydrogenic approximation @xmath44 , for @xmath45 .",
    "we take the observed @xmath5  0.7 , and generate the theoretical spectrum shown up close in fig .",
    "[ fig - waregion]b ( for @xmath27 = 100 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the apparent redshift of the edge is partially explained by the @xmath46 resonance series .",
    "we propose that both the @xmath47 wide feature and residual absorption which can not be explained by the resonance series are due to the l  edges of neutral iron .",
    "the fe  l3 edge at 0.707  kev ( 17.5   ) and the associated fe  l2 edge seen in x - ray binaries ( e.g. x0614 + 011 , paerels et al .",

    "the agreement is remarkable , with most of the differences accounted for by the edge and series absorption .",
    "the drop at 0.707  kev implies a neutral fe column density of @xmath48 or @xmath49 for solar abundances , but as noted in  4 , it is plausible to attribute the fe to dust in the warm absorber , in which case most of the remaining elements are ionized .",
    "one does expect other features , the most prominent being o ( cyg x-1 also shows weak si and mg features which would not be detectable in our spectrum ) . using the dust in galactic halo clouds as a guide ( sembach & savage 1996 , savage & sembach 1996 , argue for a population of oxides and perhaps pure iron grains ) suggests o / fe @xmath50 ( cf . , snow & witt 1996 ) .",
    "an associated o i edge at the agn redshift may be present in our spectrum but is confused by the instrumental o i edge which has not yet been fully calibrated .",
    "( br2001 report an unspecified excess o absorption . )",
    "we attribute the unresolved absorption line at @xmath51   ( 0.562  kev ; fig .",
    "[ fig - waregion]a ) , detected at @xmath52% confidence in the full observation , to the strongest kll resonance ( photoexcitation to a doubly excited state followed by auto - ionization ) in the photoabsorption cross section for o  vi as recently calculated by pradhan ( 2000 ) .",
    "the meg easily separates this feature ( which is itself an unresolved doublet ) from the nearby forbidden line at 22.09  (561  ev ) discussed below , giving an o  vi equivalent width of @xmath53  m(0.74  ev ) . using pradhan s effective oscillator strength of 0.58 for this feature ( assuming no radiative damping and @xmath30 ) gives @xmath54 .",
    "( an associated o  vi edge at 0.698  kev [ 17.76   ] is too weak to be seen in our data . )",
    "we have made a first attempt at modeling the spectrum of 6 . while not definitive , our model does explain the overall shape and most of the absorption features .",
    "in addition to the @xmath55 power - law , we require a soft component and absorption by two ionized zones and neutrals in dust .",
    "at least two zones are needed to explain the wide range in ionization states that we observe from the absorption species .",
    "( multiple zones were also previously suggested for 6 by reynolds et al .",

    "a neutral fe :",
    "o ratio of 1:2 is supported by the data , and is consistent with dust composed of fe oxides or olivine ( @xmath58 ) . the si edge would not be detectable in our data .",

    "emission from reconbination or resonance scattering is ignored ( see below ) .",
    "the low and high ionization zones are respectively ( @xmath61=0.7 ; @xmath62 = 21.7 ) , and ( @xmath61=2.5 ; @xmath62 = 22.5 ) , where @xmath63 . the model includes a 10% scattered continuum .",
    "the multi - component warm absorber introduces an accumulation of absorption lines and edges ( in particular various stages of fe , ne , mg ) which causes the spectrum to roll over below 2  kev .",
    "a soft excess is required to compensate for this absorption at energies @xmath10  0.7  kev .",
    "if it were not for the absorption , a single power - law with galactic absorption could roughly account for the flux below 0.7  kev and above 2  kev .",
    "our data can not distinguish between a power - law of @xmath64 or a 0.13  kev thermal black body for the soft excess .",
    "( however , a 0.13  kev blackbody would imply a mass for 6 @xmath65 , which is implausible ) .",
    "we detect the @xmath66@xmath67@xmath68 ( forbidden ) emission line at @xmath69   ( 561  ev ) with @xmath799.9% confidence and equivalent width @xmath70  m ( 2.2  ev ) for the combined observation . this line is particularly strong in photoionized plasmas and is unaffected by resonance scattering , so it is a good measure of the total rate of recombination ( and therefore photoionization ) at the source .",
    "we can obtain an estimate for the covering factor @xmath71 of the absorber by comparing the  ( f ) flux with the ionization rate along the line - of - sight for @xmath72 . taking a branching ratio for  ( f ) of @xmath73 per recombination ( computed for @xmath74  k , following porquet & dubau 2000 , and mewe & gronenschild 1981 )",
    ", we find @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the ratio of the ionizing flux averaged over the light - travel time across the warm absorber region to the flux averaged over our observation .",
    "the presence of  ( f ) emission must be accompanied by @xmath66@xmath77@xmath68 resonance ( r ) line emission which could partially fill in the corresponding absorption line at @xmath78  (574  ev ) .",
    "the ( r)/(f ) ratio from recombination is @xmath79 ( porquet & dubau 2000 ) implying an equivalent width of @xmath80  m in ( r ) .",
    "in addition to recombination , re - emission ( and possibly cascades ) following resonance absorption can also fill in some of the resonance lines .",
    "the actual amount of filling in from such resonance scattering is strongly dependent on geometry and radiative transfer . in any case , neglecting it strengthens our arguments for lower limits to the ion column densities based on the resonance absorption lines . from the  ( f ) line we estimate for @xmath74  k ( using nahar 1999 and porquet & dubau 2000 ) that the equivalent width of the radiative recombination ( bound - free ) continuum from is @xmath81  ev with a likely width of @xmath82  ev , so it would not be prominent in our data .",
    "br2001 concluded that their rgs observation of 6 was `` physically and spectroscopically inconsistent '' with `` standard '' warm absorber models .",
    "the thrust of their argument is the inconsistency between the apparent highly redshifted and edges and the absence of corresponding resonance absorption lines , which would be expected for any but the most contrived kinematic models .",
    "the same conclusion is reached for the similar spectrum of mkn 766 .",
    "they then propose that the spectra of both sources be explained by strong , highly relativistically broadened ly @xmath21 emission lines of h - like o , n and c from the near vicinity of a kerr black hole .",
    "this model implies that the rollover in the continuum below @xmath83  kev is due to a @xmath84 to @xmath85 break in the power - law .",
    "the absorption lines they detect are attributed to low column density absorbers with turbulent velocities @xmath86 fwhm ; note that such velocities would be easily resolved in our spectra , which have @xmath7 3 times better resolution , but are not seen .",
    "our hetg spectrum of 6 shows that a dusty warm - absorber model is not only adequate to describe all the spectral features @xmath87 kev ( @xmath88  ) , the data _ require _ it .",
    "firstly , we observe an abundance of highly - ionized resonance lines from a myriad of species in a range of ionization states ( from o  vi to si  xiii to fe  xxiii ) .",
    "the complex of these absorption features and associated edges will cause the spectrum to roll over at @xmath89  kev , but also to partially recover at lower energies .",
    "secondly , we detect the o  vii @xmath90 resonance absorption lines at the expected positions for absorbing material at rest in the agn frame .",
    "the roughly comparable strengths of these lines indicate an o  vii edge opacity of at least @xmath91 0.2 .",
    "the value @xmath72 indicated by the discontinuity at the edge ( at rest in the agn frame ) is fully consistent with the line strengths for @xmath30 .",
    "thirdly , we show that the _ apparent _ highly redshifted edge which prompted the br2001 interpretation can be explained in the context of a warm absorber .",
    "we propose that it is partly due to the expected redward shift of the absorption edge by the overlapping @xmath92 , @xmath46 series of absorption lines , and partly to an fe  l edge complex from a significant column density of neutral fe .",
    "the shape of this complex is remarkably similar to that seen in the meg data of cyg x-1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - waregion]b , schulz 2001 ) .",
    "a strong edge is not seen in our data , however a small edge is fully consistent with the observed ly @xmath21 and ly @xmath22 absorption lines .",
    "previous reports of a redshifted edge can be attributed to the series of fe and ne lines near 0.87  kev ( 14.2   ) which could mimic a broadened / shifted edge .",
    "our first attempts to model the full spectrum also require an additional soft emission component , but this should be broad ( e.g. , a steep power law or black body ) . of course , we can not rule out some small contribution from relativistically broadened emission lines as well , and our data can not address the shape of the spectrum below 0.48 kev .",
    "however , since we see no evidence for such line emission and can explain the great many features we do see as coming from a dusty warm absorber , we conclude that the br2001 interpretation of a spectrum dominated by relativistic line emission is no longer tenable .    the most plausible explanation of the fe  i  l feature is absorption by dust that is embedded in the partially ionized material .",
    "[ grain survival in the dusty warm absorber of 6 is addressed by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . ] otherwise , for cosmic abundances the implied neutral column density , @xmath93 , would extinguish the x - ray spectrum at low energies , contrary to the observations .",
    "the presence of dust in the warm absorber of 6 was already identified by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on the optical reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.611.09 , which implies @xmath94 ( cox 1999 ) .",
    "our independent measurement based on the fe  l absorption is consistent with this value .",
    "therefore the presence of neutral absorption is not only explained , it is required by the observed reddening .",
    "( dusty warm absorbers have been suggested for other agn as well [ e.g. brandt , fabian , & pounds 1996 , reynolds 1997 , komossa 2000 ; see also mathur 1994 ] . )",
    "this first detection of a spectral feature attributed to the dust in an ionized absorber provides a new probe of this component .",
    "the shape of the fe l features and the detection or limits on other absorbing species may eventually constrain the chemical composition of the grains .",
    "we note that mrk  766 ( br2001 ) also shows optical / uv extinction ( walter & fink 1993 ) suggesting that the above explanation for mcg6 - 30 - 15 may also apply .",
    "we believe that our detection of an o vi photoabsorption kll resonance is the first time such a feature has been detected in the x - ray band ( possibly including in the laboratory ) .",
    "it has two important implications .",
    "first , it shows that even relatively low ionization states previously detectable only in the uv can be studied in detail in the x - ray band .",
    "second , it underscores the importance of having detailed calculations of the complex resonant structure in the photoabsorption cross sections of highly ionized species .",
    "recent calculations show great complexity ( e.g. nahar 1999 , zhang & pradhan 1999 , pradhan 2000 ) that has not yet been incorporated into the models of warm absorbers .",
    "the estimate of @xmath95% placed on @xmath71 by the strength of the  ( f ) emission suggests that the observed luminosity of the nucleus is @xmath7 its average over the light - travel time across the region ( @xmath5 years , see otani 1996 ) else @xmath71 would be implausibly small .",
    "these observations , and other recent work on agn with and ( e.g. kaastra 2000 , kaspi 2000 , ogle 2000 , sako 2001a , b ) illustrate the enormous power of high resolution spectroscopy to probe the detailed physics of the ionized region in agn .",
    "they also show the complexity of these regions , as anticipated by netzer ( 1993 ) , nicastro ( 1999 ) , porquet & dubau ( 2000 ) and others .",
    "for example , our data imply that the 6 absorber spans a wide and possibly continuous range of ionization , with embedded dust that will introduce complex absorption features and also affect the state of the plasma . resonance scattering and cascades",
    "are also likely to be important , as is recombination line emission , as indicated by the detection of  ( f ) .",
    "the absorbing region may also be a source of thermal line emission , as seen in the hetg observation of ngc  4151 ( ogle 2000 ) .",
    "we intend to pursue these issues in future publications .",
    "we wish to thank anil pradhan for useful conversations , max pettini for the use of his curve - of - growth program , jeff kortright , kathryn flanagan and eric gullikson for the latest experimental values for the atomic scattering factors in the fel region .",
