    "in this paper we consider the quantile hedging problem when the underlying market does not have an equivalent martingale measure .",
    "instead , we assume that there exists a _ local martingale deflator _ ( a strict local martingale which when multiplied by the asset prices yields a positive local martingale ) .",
    "we characterize the value function as the smallest nonnegative viscosity supersolution of a fully non - linear partial differential equation .",
    "this resolves the open problem proposed in the final section of @xcite ; also see pages 61 and 62 of @xcite .",
    "our framework falls under the umbrella of the stochastic portfolio theory of fernholz and karatzas , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; and the benchmark approach of platen @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the linear partial differential equation that the superhedging price satisfies does not have a unique solution ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena occur when the asset prices have _ bubbles _ : an equivalent local martingale measure exists , but the asset prices under this measure are strict local martingales ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a related series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite addressed the issue of bubbles in the context of stochastic volatility models .",
    "in particular , @xcite gave necessary and sufficient conditions for linear partial differential equations appearing in the context of stochastic volatility models to have a unique solution .",
    "in contrast , we show that the quantile hedging problem , which is equivalent to an optimal control problem , is the smallest nonnegative viscosity supersolution to a fully non - linear pde . as in the linear case",
    ", these pdes may not have a unique solution , and , therefore , an alternative characterization for the value function needs to be provided .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite also considered stochastic control problems in this framework .",
    "the first reference solves the classical utility maximization problem , the second one solves the optimal stopping problem , whereas the third one determines the optimal arbitrage under model uncertainty , which is equivalent to solving a zero - sum stochastic game .",
    "the structure of the paper is simple : in section  [ eq : model ] , we formulate the problem . in this section",
    "we also discuss the implications of assuming the existence of a local martingale deflator . in section  [ sec : quantile - hedging ] , we generalize the results of @xcite on quantile hedging , in particular the neyman - pearson lemma .",
    "we also prove other properties of the value function such as convexity .",
    "section  [ sec : pde - characterization ] is where we give the pde characterization of the value function .",
    "we consider a financial market with a bond which is always equal to @xmath0 , and @xmath1 stocks @xmath2 which satisfy @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a @xmath1-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "following the set up in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) , we make the following assumption .",
    "[ as : fassp ] let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be continuous functions .",
    "set @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which we assume to be invertible for all @xmath9 .",
    "we also assume that has a weak solution that is unique in distribution for every initial value .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the probability space specified by a weak solution .",
    "another assumption we will impose is that @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath14 the right - continuous version of the natural filtration generated by @xmath15 , and by @xmath16 the @xmath17-augmentation of the filtration @xmath18 .",
    "thanks to assumption  [ as : fassp ] , the brownian motion @xmath19 of is adapted to @xmath16 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) , every local martingale of @xmath18 has the martingale representation property , i.e. it can be represented as a stochastic integral , with respect to @xmath20 , of some @xmath16-progressively measurable integrand ( see e.g. the discussion on p.1185 in @xcite ) , the solution of takes values in the positive orthant , and the exponential local martingale @xmath21 the so - called _ deflator _ is well defined .",
    "we do not exclude the possibility that @xmath22 is a strict local martingale .",
    "let @xmath23 be the set of @xmath16-progressively measurable processes @xmath24 , which satisfies @xmath25 in which @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "at time @xmath31 , an investor invests @xmath32 proportion of his wealth in the @xmath33 stock . the proportion @xmath34 gets invested in the bond .",
    "for each @xmath35 and initial wealth @xmath36 the associated wealth process will be denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "this process solves @xmath38    it can be easily seen that @xmath39 is a positive local martingale for any @xmath35 .",

    "note that if @xmath44 has linear growth , then is satisfied since the process @xmath45 is a positive supermartingale .",
    "although , we do not assume the existence of equivalent local martingale measures , we assume the existence of a local martingale deflator .",
    "this is equivalent to the _ no - unbounded - profit - with - bounded - risk _ ( nupbr ) condition ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.12 ) .",
    "nupbr is defined as follows : a sequence @xmath46 of admissible portfolios is said to generate a upbr if @xmath47>0 $ ] .",
    "if no such sequence exists , then we say that nupbr holds ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.2 ) .",
    "in fact , the so - called _ no - free - lunch - with - vanishing - risk _ ( nflvr ) is equivalent to nupbr plus the classical _ no - arbitrage _ assumption .",
    "thus , in our setting ( since we assumed the existence of local martingale deflators ) , although arbitrages exist they remain on the level of  cheap thrills \" , which was coined by @xcite .",
    "( note that the results of karatzas and kardaras @xcite also imply that one does not need nflvr for the portfolio optimization problem of an individual to be well - defined .",
    "one merely needs the nupbr condition to hold . )",
    "the failure of no - arbitrage means that the money market is not an optimal investment and is dominated by other investments .",
    "it follows that a short position in the money market and long position in the dominating assets leads one to arbitrage .",
    "however , one can not scale the arbitrage and make an arbitrary profit because of the admissibility constraint , which requires the wealth to be positive .",
    "this is what is contained in nupbr , which holds in our setting .",
    "also , see @xcite , where these issues are further discussed .",
    "in this section , we develop new probabilistic tools to extend results of f@xmath48llmer and leukert @xcite on quantile hedging to settings where equivalent martingale measures need not exist .",
    "this is not only mathematically intriguing , but also economically important because it admits arbitrage in the market , which opens the door to the notion of optimal arbitrage , recently introduced in fernholz and karatzas @xcite .",
    "the tools in this section facilitate the discussion of quantile hedging under the context of optimal arbitrage , leading us to generalize the results of @xcite on this sort of probability - one outperformance .",
