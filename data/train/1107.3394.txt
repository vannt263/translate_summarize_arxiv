    "our theoretical knowledge of the universe is based on the standard cosmological model , that provides a convenient framework to satisfactorily explain the majority of cosmological observations , like the anisotropy pattern of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite , the hubble diagram of distant type ia supernovae @xcite and the abundances of light elements @xcite .",
    "the standard cosmological model relies on the assumption that the universe , at least at large scales , is highly homogeneous and isotropic , and its geometry is thus described by the robertson - walker metric .",
    "in fact , the distribution of luminous red galaxies shows that the present universe is homogeneous on scales greater than @xmath4 mpc @xcite , while the isotropy of the cmb itself ( which has a black - body distribution at @xmath5k with temperature fluctuations of order @xmath6 or less ) is an indication of the isotropy of the universe as a whole and a strong evidence for homogeneity at the time of hydrogen recombination ( nearly 400.000 years after the big bang , corresponding to a cosmological redshift @xmath7 ) . on the other hand , below the `` homogeneity scale '' of 100 mpc ,",
    "the distribution of matter is definitely inhomogeneous .",
    "such a dichotomy between the smoothness in the matter - energy distribution at @xmath8 and the clumpiness of the recent universe ( for @xmath9 ) below a certain scale is explained by the mechanism of gravitational instability : the structures we observe today have been formed through the growth of tiny density perturbation seeds that , accordingly to the currently accepted model , were created in the early universe during a phase of inflationary expansion .",
    "the presence of a large scale ( _ i.e. _ , coherent over a hubble length ) , strong magnetic field is forbidden by the observed isotropy , as it would naturally single out a preferred spatial direction .",
    "however , a background and uniform magnetic field could be present at cosmological scales provided that its intensity is small enough .",
    "in particular , upper limits on the present field intensity of order @xmath10 g have been derived from observations of the cmb temperature anisotropies @xcite and of its temperature - polarization correlation @xcite .",
    "smaller scale fields , on the other hand , could be as strong as @xmath11 g.    the effects of large - scale magnetic fields on the evolution of cosmological structures have been studied extensively in the literature ( for a complete review , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) , where both newtonian and general relativistic treatments , the latter often using covariant and gauge - invariant techniques , are present .",
    "it is known that , among others , magnetic fields slow down ( and possibly prevent ) the growth of perturbations and can produce vorticities and shape distortions in the density field @xcite . in this letter , our goal is to revisit the issue of the existence of a `` magnetic jeans length '' and of its dependence on the direction along which the perturbation propagates , other than to give a realistic estimate of its value in a matter - dominated universe .",
    "the presence of a magnetic jeans length has been discussed in several papers @xcite both in a newtonian and in general relativistic framework ( for an analysis of the standard jeans mechanism in the presence of dissipative effect see also @xcite ) , but some of the analyses failed to recognize its angular dependence . here , we present a neat derivation of the relevant instability scales bases on the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) on an expanding universe . we discuss a simple generalization of the magnetic jeans length suited for two - fluid systems , and clarify some misunderstandings that are present in the literature .",
    "we also show the results of the numerical integration of the coupled mhd and poisson equations .",
    "finally , we numerically study the distortion introduced in the density field by the anisotropy in the critical length .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we characterize the universe as a plasma . in sec . 3",
    ", we introduce the basic equations , and in sec .",
    "4 we carry out the linearization procedure .",
    "we derive the existence of the magnetic jeans length from analytical considerations in sec . 5 , while in sec .",
    "6 we show some numerical results .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section , we aim at characterizing the plasma features of the cosmological fluid . between the time of @xmath12 annihilation ( _ i.e. _ , for a temperature . ]",
    "@xmath13 , corresponding to a redshift @xmath14 ) and the present ( @xmath15 ) , the matter - energy content of the universe is provided by electrons , protons and neutrons ( the three species being collectively referred to as baryons in the cosmological jargon ) , photons , neutrinos , and two elusive components dubbed dark matter and dark energy , that presently account for more than 99% of the total energy budget of the universe . however , dark energy has been subdominant for most of the past history of the universe and can be safely neglected at redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "dark matter and neutrinos interact only gravitationally with the other components and can be neglected as long as the plasma properties of the fluid are concerned .",
    "the cosmological baryon - to - photon ratio is extremely small and equal to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the photon and baryon number densities , respectively .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath18 scale with redshift as @xmath20 ; their present values are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "most of the baryons in the universe are in the form of @xmath23 nuclei ( i.e. , isolated protons ) so that , for simplicity , in the following we assume @xmath24 ( @xmath25 being the proton number density ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath25 is also equal to the electron number density @xmath26 , because of the charge neutrality of the universe .",
    "we study separately the properties of the cosmological fluid before and after the time of hydrogen recombination occurring at @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the protons and electrons are free and thus one deals with a fully ionized plasma . in this regime ,",
    "photons and baryons are tightly coupled due to thomson scattering , and share a common temperature @xmath30 , where the present photon temperature @xmath31 .",
    "after recombination ( @xmath32 ) , most of the electrons and protons exist in the form of neutral hydrogen atoms , and only a small residual ionized fraction @xmath33 survives , making the fluid a weakly ionized plasma . in this regime",
    ", the photon temperature still scales as @xmath34 , while that of baryons evolves in the same way only until @xmath35 , due to residual scatterings that keep them in thermal equilibrium with photons ; after that time , their temperature decreases faster , as @xmath36 .",
    "the baryonic fluid remains neutral until the time of reionization , when the uv radiation produced by the first stars ionizes again the hydrogen present in the cosmological medium .",
    "this is likely to have happened around @xmath37 , however the precise details of the reionization history are still largely unknown , and for this reason we limit our analysis to redshifts @xmath38 .    in the following , we will assume the presence of a background homogeneous magnetic field @xmath39 , whose contribution to the total energy density of the universe can be considered negligible .",
    "we recall that the field intensity @xmath40 scales as @xmath41 and , unless otherwise stated , we take its value at the present time to be @xmath42 g.      a fundamental quantity characterizing a plasma is the debye length @xmath43 , namely the length over which electrons screen out electric fields in a plasma .",
    "it defines the length scale over which a system can consistently considered to be a plasma .",
    "the debye length of a hydrogen plasma at temperature @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the proton charge . using @xmath47 and the values given above",
    ", one gets @xmath48 the redshift dependence of @xmath43 implies that the comoving debye length @xmath49 is constant during the cosmological evolution and equal to @xmath50 .",
    "plasma effects can be important in a system when its physical dimension @xmath51 is much larger than the debye length .",
    "for the universe , the relevant length is the hubble radius @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the hubble parameter .",
    "this length represents the maximum scale at which microphysical processes can operate in order to establish the thermodynamical equilibrium . today , @xmath54 ; during the matter - dominated era @xmath55 , while in the radiation - dominated era @xmath56 . from the analysis of both these scales ,",
    "it is evident that @xmath57 turns out in the period considered here .",
    "moreover , under the same hypotheses , the baryonic matter @xmath58 within a debye sphere is also constant and given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the proton mass .",
    "this `` debye mass '' clearly results to be much smaller than any other of cosmological interest and we can conclude that the cosmological fluid can be considered as neutral at all relevant scales .",
    "another meaningful index is the so - called plasma parameter @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of particles within a debye sphere : @xmath62 the dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath25 on the redshift @xmath63 implies that also @xmath61 is a constant . in particular , since @xmath64 , the cosmological fluid results to be a weakly coupled plasma .    in order to provide a complete characterization of the cosmological plasma",
    ", we now turn our attention to the plasma dissipative properties , starting from the plasma resistivity @xmath65 . for an electron - proton plasma , this is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the electron mass and @xmath68 is the electron - ion collision frequency . for the case under consideration , @xmath68 is well approximated by the electron - electron collision frequency @xmath69 @xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the coulomb logarithm , introduced to quantify the effects that small - angle - diffusion collisions have in the coulomb scattering . a simply estimate of @xmath72 in a plasma",
    "is given by @xmath73 , so that for the cosmological fluid , the coulomb logarithm is @xmath74 .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : nu_ei ] ) into the expression for the resistivity given above , we get @xmath75 close to recombination , the cosmological plasma has an electric resistivity equal to @xmath76 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a conductivity @xmath77 siemens @xmath78 , a value typical of a semiconductor [ in gaussian units , @xmath79 .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the viscous properties of the plasma .",
    "the shear viscosity coefficient of matter strongly coupled with radiation can be expressed as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , while @xmath82 denotes the mean collision time between particles and can be estimated as @xmath83 ( here , @xmath84 and we have introduced @xmath85 as the cross section for thomson scattering ) . for a photon gas at equilibrium at temperature @xmath44 , @xmath86 and",
    "then @xmath87    the resistivity and viscosity coefficients enter the mhd equations through the following diffusion coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the density of the fluid .",
    "taking @xmath91 kg m@xmath92 and using @xmath93 , we get @xmath94 the relative magnitude of the viscous and magnetic diffusion rates can be parameterized through the magnetic prandtl number @xmath95 . using the expression above for @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    ", we obtain @xmath98 so that @xmath99 , _",
    "i.e. _ , viscous diffusion is more important than resistive diffusion , at recombination and indeed always at the redshifts under consideration .",
    "having discussed the relative importance of viscosity- and resistivity - driven dissipative effects , we now analyze at which scales these effects are relevant . in a magnetized plasma ,",
    "a useful parameter is the lundquist number @xmath100 , where @xmath51 is a typical length scale and @xmath101 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "the lundquist number is basically the ratio between the resistive diffusion timescale @xmath102 and the alfvn crossing timescale @xmath103 .",
    "assuming @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we obtain @xmath106^{1/2}$ ] and thus @xmath107 we also compare @xmath108 with the viscous diffusion timescale defined as @xmath109 . the ratio @xmath110 can be thought as a viscous analogous to the lundquist number : @xmath111 the baryonic mass ( at the average background density ) contained in a sphere of radius equal to the length where @xmath112 can be calculated to be @xmath113^{-3}$ ] , while the analogous quantity for @xmath114 is @xmath115^{-9/2}$ ] .",
    "both mass scales are well below the values of cosmological relevance at the redshifts of interest .",
    "the discussion above shows how the following hierarchy among the relevant time scales holds for all mass range and redshifts of interest : @xmath116 meaning that viscosity always dominates over resistivity , and that both dissipative effects can indeed be neglected when studying the propagation of alfvn waves .      after the time of recombination @xmath117 , the cosmological plasma exists in a weakly ionized state , the neutral and ionized components having densities @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "we take the residual ionization fraction @xmath120 constant and equal to @xmath121 in the range @xmath122 .",
    "the results of the previous subsection can be generalized to show that the hierarchy ( [ eq : hierdiss ] ) holds also in this regime .    in spite of the small value of the ionization fraction",
    ", the magnetic field could still affect the dynamics of the whole system in view of the interactions between neutral and charged particles .",
    "in particular , the magnetic forces acting on the charged particles can be communicated to the neutrals through collisions . however , if the coupling is not tight enough , the neutrals feel the magnetic field but drift with respect to the ions in a process termed _",
    "ambipolar diffusion_. its relevance at a given length scale @xmath51 is quantified by the ambipolar reynolds number @xmath123 @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 @xcite is the ion - neutral drag coefficient due to collisions between the two species , @xmath126 is the alfvn velocity in the tightly coupled limit , @xmath127 is the characteristic velocity of the fluid , and @xmath128 is the ambipolar length , i.e. , the scale where @xmath129 . the ambipolar reynolds number is just the ratio between the ambipolar diffusion timescale @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 is the neutral collision timescale ) and some characteristic timescale @xmath132 .",
    "if @xmath133 , the neutrals are uncoupled from the plasma .",
    "on the contrary , when @xmath134 the dynamics of the two components can be described through ordinary single - fluid mhd with an additional dissipative term @xcite .",
    "this term becomes progressively less important as @xmath123 grows and can be neglected in the limit @xmath135 , or @xmath136 .",
    "assuming that the evolution of the fluid is driven by alfvnic phenomena , i.e. , @xmath137 , the ambipolar length is given by @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "thus , @xmath135 if and only if the tight - coupling condition @xmath140 is satisfied .     defined in eq.([eq : lamb ] ) as a function of redshift @xmath63 . above line , the condition @xmath141 holds.[fig : lamb ] ]    it is straightforward to check that for @xmath142 , it is always @xmath143 at scales larger than a few tens of comoving kiloparsecs , meaning that the following hierarchy holds : @xmath144 so that the ions and neutrals are tightly coupled and ambipolar diffusion can be safely neglected . in order to better illustrate this point , in figure [ fig : lamb ] we plot the mass contained in a sphere of radius @xmath128 at the background baryon density as a function of redshift .",
    "it is evident that , in the redshift range considered , @xmath135 for all scales @xmath145 .    in this regime",
    ", we can therefore neglect the dissipative term mentioned above and use single - fluid ideal mhd .",
    "we conclude that ambipolar diffusion does not affect the dynamics of the cosmological plasma after recombination .",
    "in this section , we derive the basic equations describing the linear evolution of instabilities in the cosmological fluid , modeled as a magnetized plasma . in this respect , we underline that the full investigation of the perturbative dynamics of the universe would require a general - relativistic treatment , in order to correlate the matter and geometrical fluctuations . however , as long as one is interested in scales much smaller than the hubble radius , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath146 , a newtonian treatment provides a consistent description of the dynamics .",
    "nonetheless , in this scenario the expansion of the universe can be accounted as the bulk background motion of the fluid .",
    "the starting point of our treatment is the eulerian set of equations governing the fluid motion , on which one can develop a perturbative theory by adding small fluctuations to the unperturbed cosmological background solution .",
    "the zeroth - order dynamics is derived by considering a flat homogeneous and isotropic universe whose energy density is dominated by non - relativistic matter , and correctly describes the expansion of the universe .",
    "we assume that a background magnetic field is present , whose contribution to the total energy density of the universe can be considered negligible .",
    "let us now start by briefly recalling the basic equations of non - relativistic , ideal and single fluid mhd , which govern the plasma motion .",
    "the mass conservation and the newtonian gravitational field are described by the continuity and poisson equations , the single - fluid dynamics is described by the euler equation in presence of a magnetic field @xmath147 and , finally , the electromagnetic interaction can be summarized by the frozen - in and the gauss laws .",

    "before recombination , the baryons are completely ionized and they are tightly coupled to photons , at least at scales larger than the comoving photon mean free path @xmath269^{-2}$ ] .",
    "at these scales , the total pressure of the fluid is given by radiation pressure .",
    "after recombination , most of the protons and electrons are in the form of neutral hydrogen atoms , leaving a small ionized fraction @xmath270 . at the scales of interest , the neutral and ionized components are tightly coupled by collisions ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : post_uni ] ) and can be treated as a single fluid .",
    "however , photons are now free streaming so that the baryon pressure is given just by kinetic pressure , dropping down by several orders of magnitude with respect to its pre - recombination value .         in view of this , we take the speed of sound of the cosmological fluid before and after recombination to be @xmath271 respectively , where @xmath272 is the specific entropy .",
    "we recall that @xmath273 for @xmath274 , while afterwards @xmath275 .",
    "the expression above for the sound speed is rigorously valid only for scales corresponding to baryonic masses @xmath276 , that stay above the photon mean free path until the time of recombination . at smaller scales , baryons lose the radiation support before recombination , roughly when the given scale goes below the photon mean free path , and it is at this time that the switch between the two expressions in eq.([vsvs ] ) should take place . in the following",
    ", we shall consider masses nearly as small as @xmath277 , for which the photon decoupling effectively takes place at @xmath265 ( very close to the time of matter - radiation equality ) .",
    "however , we choose to switch between the two expressions for the sound speed at @xmath8 irregardless of scale and shall comment later on how we expect this choice to affect our results .    following the discussion in sec .",
    "[ ssec : post_uni ] , the alfvn velocity is taken to be @xmath278 where @xmath279 should always be intended as the total baryon density , both before and after recombination .",
    "a plot of the alfvn and sound speeds as functions of redshift is shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : soundspeed ] .",
    "the sudden drop in the sound speed at recombination is due to the sharp decrease of baryon pressure after photon decoupling .    in a detailed model",
    ", the presence of different uncoupled components making up the matter content of the universe should be taken into account .",
    "in fact , most of the matter ( @xmath280 ) is in the form of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , interacting with the baryon - photon fluid only through the gravitational force .",
    "thus , a proper treatment should rely on a two - fluid description . in the following",
    ", we shall ignore perturbations in the cdm component , however we argue that we can still draw meaningful conclusions about the perturbations in the baryonic component",
    ". in fact , in the pre - recombination era , the large radiation pressure prevents baryons to fall into the potential wells created by cdm ; this is known to be true in the non - magnetic case but we expect it to hold also in the case under consideration since , as seen in the last section , the magnetic field only acts to increase stability . thus in this regime",
    "the cdm and baryon perturbations are effectively decoupled .",
    "after recombination , the baryon density perturbations will take some time to catch up with those in the cdm component and we expect our treatment will rigorously remain valid for some time .    before showing the results of the numerical integration , we illustrate in the lower panel figure [ fig : soundspeed ] the evolution of the standard jeans wavenumber ( [ eq : jeans ] ) and of its `` magnetic '' counterpart ( [ eq : jeansm ] ) .",
    "in order to take out the change in @xmath281 and @xmath282 due to the expansion , we follow the convention to express the results in terms of the mass contained inside the corresponding length scales @xmath283 . in particular , we consider the total baryonic mass ( irrespective of the ionization state ) , contained inside a sphere of radius @xmath284 . it can be seen that the window of modes that are made stable by the magnetic field , _ i.e. _ , those between the red dashed and the black solid line , spans , right after recombination , five orders of magnitude in mass .    as noted in the introduction",
    ", the existence of a magnetic jeans length has been studied previously and all expressions for the critical wavenumber agree , apart from numerical factors , with expression ( [ eq : jeansm ] ) .",
    "however , the numerical estimates of this and associated quantities that are found in the literature sometimes differ from our results .",
    "the reason seems to be that often the density @xmath285 that appears in eq.([eq : jeansm ] ) is taken to be the present critical density @xmath286 kg m@xmath92 .",
    "this yields at the present time a magnetic jeans length @xmath287 kpc for @xmath288 g and @xmath289 mpc for @xmath290 g .. the reason why a galaxy is much smaller than 1 mpc is that it has detached from the hubble flow and undergone non - linear evolution , so that its density is much larger than the cosmological average .",
    "] using instead the baryon density for @xmath285 will yield values of @xmath291 a factor @xmath292 larger , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath293 mpc for @xmath294 g. this amounts to a factor @xmath295 difference in the corresponding mass scale at the numerator of eq.([eq : jeansm ] ) , while keeping the same expression for @xmath296 .",
    "this makes the value of @xmath291 roughly twice smaller than in the case in which only baryons are considered , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath297 mpc for @xmath294 g. ] .",
    "we now discuss the results of the direct numerical integration of eqs.([master - system ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the integration have been chosen using the fact that power - law solutions for @xmath213 can be found in the limit @xmath298 .",
    "there are four distinct solutions of this kind , but only one corresponds to a growing mode .",
    "we have matched the initial conditions to the asymptotic growing solution at the initial time of integration .",
    "the latter has been chosen so that all the modes of interest were outside the horizon at that time .",
    "even if the initial time falls in what would be the radiation - dominated era , nevertheless we always consider a matter - dominated universe .",
    "all results have been normalized to the initial value of the density contrast .        in figure",
    "[ fig : deltak ] , we show the evolution of the density contrast for three different wavenumbers @xmath299 ( normalized at the present time ) , _ i.e. _ , for the following baryonic masses @xmath300 .",
    "these masses roughly correspond to the scale of a dwarf galaxy , of a galaxy and of a galaxy cluster respectively . for each mode",
    ", we show the evolution in both the direction parallel to the background magnetic field ( @xmath301 ) and orthogonally to that direction ( @xmath246 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the perturbation is initially growing but then starts to oscillate once the jeans mass ( that is growing ) becomes larger than the mass of the perturbation .",
    "this happens earlier for smaller scales . in this phase",
    "the magnetic pressure does not play any role , as the much larger radiation pressure is actually providing the force that prevents the collapse .",
    "in fact , there is no difference in the evolution parallel and orthogonal to the field , as the radiation pressure is isotropic .",
    "the situation changes dramatically after recombination , when the baryon pressure drops and only the magnetic pressure can possibly oppose the growth , at least in the plane orthogonal to the field .",
    "thus , perturbations in the direction of the field can grow unhindered , while the perturbations that are orthogonal can be stabilized . as it can be seen from figure",
    "[ fig : deltak ] , this is what happens for perturbations at the dwarf galaxy scale : at @xmath2 , the relative growth of parallel perturbations with respect to orthogonal ones is of order 100 . for perturbations at the galactic scale and larger , instead",
    ", the evolution is basically the same in all directions .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the lower panel of figure ( [ fig : soundspeed ] ) , from which it is clear that the pressure induced by a magnetic field of @xmath3 g can only stabilize perturbations with mass @xmath302 .",
    "we recall that we have neglected the fact that , at the dwarf galaxy scale , the support of radiation pressure is not lost at recombination but some time before ( see previous subsection ) . from the discussion above ,",
    "it is clear that , had we taken into account this fact , the evolution of orthogonal and parallel perturbations would have begun to differentiate earlier .",
    "this goes in the direction of enhancing the anisotropic growth of perturbation and the `` squeezing '' effect studied in the following .",
    "the fact that , after recombination , the evolution of the density contrast in the presence of a magnetic field changes for different directions leads to the reasonable expectation that some degree of anisotropy will be generated even in initially symmetric structures . in order to show this",
    ", we consider a gaussian density fluctuation with standard deviation @xmath303 in coordinate space at recombination : @xmath304 where the @xmath305 are comoving coordinates centered at the maximum of the perturbation .",
    "after fourier - transforming , we separately evolve the different harmonics in momentum space using eqs.([master - system ] ) and we finally transform back to obtain the perturbation in coordinate space at a later time . in figure",
    "[ fig : deltax ] we show , for a background magnetic field directed along the @xmath306 axis and with a present intensity of 1 ng , the evolution of a perturbation with @xmath307 kpc at recombination ( so that the @xmath308 region encloses a mass @xmath309 at the mean baryonic density , _",
    "i.e. _ , roughly the mass of a dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "in particular , we show equal density contours at @xmath310 and @xmath311 .",
    "it is evident from the figure how the perturbation becomes progressively squeezed along the direction orthogonal to the magnetic field .    in order to quantify the anisotropy in the perturbation",
    ", we consider the isodensity contour corresponding to half the value at the peak and calculate its eccentricity @xmath312 , where @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the lengths of the semi - major and semi - minor axis of the contour , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : ecc ] , we show how the eccentricity changes with redshift ; for the parameters used above , we get @xmath313 at @xmath2 .",
    "we have studied the effect of a background magnetic field on the linear evolution of cosmological density perturbations at scales well below the hubble length , where a newtonian treatment can be used , focusing on the matter - dominated era .",
    "the conditions that allow for the growth of small density perturbations have been clearly stated .",
    "in particular , we have found that in the plane orthogonal to the ambient magnetic field , a new critical length appears , related to the presence of the magnetic pressure , while everywhere else outside that plane the stability is dictated by the standard jeans criterion .",
    "this is also confirmed through a direct numerical integration of the relevant mhd equations during the matter - dominated era , and this effect is shown to be possibly important after recombination , when the magnetic pressure of baryons is much larger than their the kinetic pressure .",
    "finally , it has been shown how the dependence of the critical scale on the angle between the perturbation wavevector and the magnetic field could lead to a sizable anisotropy in the perturbations at sub - galactic scales at the onset of non - linearity .",
    "our analysis has relied on some approximations : in particular , we have ignored the gravitational effects of dark matter perturbations .",
    "we have argued that this approximation limit the validity of our treatment to some time after recombination .",
    "we defer a more detailed and fully general relativistic analysis , also taking into account the different fluid components , to a future work .",
