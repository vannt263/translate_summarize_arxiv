    "the progenitors for the narrow - lined type ii supernovae ( sn iin ) remain a mystery , and this mystery is even deeper for the rare class of very luminous type iin , with @xmath9 . while significant evidence points toward an origin from luminous blue variable stars ( lbv ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggestions for the energy source of the events span a wide range , from pair - instabilities @xcite , magnetar power @xcite , or extremely energetic core - collapse sne @xcite , to ongoing shock interactions or shock breakout from an extended progenitor @xcite .    before sn 2010jl ,",
    "the most convincing direct detection of a type iin progenitor is sn 2005gl at a distance of 66 mpc , which was a moderately luminous sn iin that transitioned into a more normal sn ii .",
    "pre - explosion images of sn 2005gl showed a star at the position of the sn with luminosity consistent with an lbv @xcite .",
    "recently it has been suggested that sn  1961v was in fact a core - collapse sn iin , rather than an eta carinae - like eruption , in part because the peak absolute magnitude was @xmath10 and because there is no surviving star detected in spitzer images @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of sn  1961v was clearly detected for decades before 1961 as a very luminous blue star , consistent with an extremely massive lbv .",
    "even more recently , sn 2009ip @xcite and sn 2010mc @xcite have become interesting cases of a `` supernova impostor '' becoming a type iin sn .",
    "as we will show , these objects are similar in some ways , but differ from sn 2010jl in the essential feature of total energy release .    from a spitzer / irac survey of type iin sne ,",
    "@xcite find mid - ir emission from @xmath11 of the sne .",
    "the most likely origin is emission from pre - existing dust heated by the optical emission from circumstellar interaction between the sn and the csm of the progenitor .",
    "estimates of the dust mass are in the range @xmath12 . with a dust to gas",
    "ratio of 1:100 this is consistent with the total mass lost in giant lbv eruptions @xcite .",
    "while medium luminosity type iin sne , like sn 1988z and sn 1995n , often are strong radio and x - ray emitters , the high luminosity iin sne are generally very weak .",
    "this may be a result of the extended massive envelopes thought to be responsible for the high luminosity of these sne , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we discuss hst and ground based observations of the type iin sn 2010jl .",
    "sn 2010jl was discovered on 2010 nov . 3.52 by newton & puckett ( 2010 ) .",
    "the first detection of sn 2010jl was , however , from pre - discovery images on 2010 october 9.6 by @xcite .",
    "based on the presence of narrow balmer lines it was classified as a type iin sn by @xcite .    from archival hst images",
    "@xcite identify a possible progenitor .",
    "although the exact nature of this star is uncertain , several facts indicate a progenitor with mass @xmath13 , although it is difficult to distinguish between a single massive star or a young cluster .",
    "@xcite find that the host is a low metallicity galaxy , as found for other luminous type iin host galaxies , which typically have metallicities @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the peak v and i magnitudes were 13.7 and 13.0 , respectively , corresponding to absolute magnitudes m@xmath15 and m@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this is considerably more luminous than the average type iin sn , m@xmath17 @xcite , and places it among the very luminous type iin sne , and close to the super - luminous sne , defined as @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the light curve showed a slow evolution with a decline by @xmath19 mag during the first 200 days @xcite .",
    "@xcite report optical spectroscopy of the sn from 2  236 days after discovery .",
    "the spectrum shows a number of strong emission lines , with a narrow and a broad component . the h@xmath20 line is well fitted with a ` lorentzian ' profile with full width half maximum fwhm @xmath21 that extends to @xmath22 .",
    "the narrow h@xmath20 line was found to be double - peaked , and can be approximated by a gaussian emission component with fwhm = 120 @xmath23 .",
    "the shift of the line peak of the broad h@xmath20 line was seen as evidence for dust formation in the post - shock gas .",
    "however , smith et .",
    "al . discussed also other scenarios based on a combination of electron scattering and continuum absorption . in this paper",
    "we show that electron scattering can explain all aspects of the line shapes .",
    "@xcite presented an extensive data set , including ubvri photometry and low resolution spectroscopy during the first @xmath24 days after first detection .",
    "although the light curves and the optical low resolution spectra agree well up to @xmath25 days , there are some important differences in the later observations and interpretation between zhang et al . and this paper ( see section [ sec_phot_results ] ) .",
    "from spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath26 m and jhk photometry at an age of 90  108 days @xcite find evidence for pre - existing dust with a mass of @xmath27 @xmath28 at a distance of @xmath29 cm from the sn . here , we complement these observations with more extensive coverage of the very late phases .",
    "an important clue to the geometry is that @xcite find strong , wavelength independent polarization at a level of @xmath30 , which indicates an asphericity with axial ratio @xmath31 .",
    "sn 2010jl was discovered as an x - ray source by @xcite .",
    "subsequent chandra observations by chandra et al . ( 2012 ) on 2010 dec .",
    "@xmath32 , and 2011 oct .",
    "17 , i.e. , 59 days and 373 days after first detection , indicate a hard spectrum with @xmath33 kev and a very large column density at the first epoch , @xmath34 @xmath35 , which decreased to @xmath36 @xmath35 at 373 days .",
    "this absorption is most likely intrinsic to the sn or its csm .",
    "nustar and xmm observations by @xcite in 2012 oct .",
    "( days @xmath37 ) were able to provide a tighter constraint on the x - ray temperature of @xmath38 kev .",
    "in addition , they also present uv and x - ray observations with the swift satellite .",
    "no radio detections have been reported .",
    "@xcite also discussed the optical light curve and found from a mass loss rate of @xmath39 , based on their assumed wind velocity of @xmath40 , and a total mass lost of @xmath41 . because of their limited optical photometry they assumed a constant bolometric correction to the photometry .",
    "they also obtained spectroscopy at only a few epochs , and these data are most important at very late phases .",
    "while most of the qualitative conclusions in their paper are similar to ours , there are some important differences which we discuss in the paper .",
    "they do not analyze the emission line spectrum in any detail , partly due to the lower spectral resolution of their data which prevents separation of the narrow component from the broad .",
    "recently @xcite discuss near - ir spectroscopic observations where they find evidence for high velocity gas from the he i @xmath42 line with velocities up to 5500 @xmath23 .",
    "this gas may be related to the x - ray emitting gas , which originates from shocks with similar velocities .",
    "based on a single spectrum at 513 days @xcite proposed that the line shifts of the balmer lines , discussed by @xcite and in this paper , result from dust formation in the ejecta .",
    "this is also the subject of a paper by @xcite , which makes a detailed analysis of the dust properties based on this interpretation . in this paper , based on extensive observations ,",
    "we show that this interpretation , however , has severe problems .",
    "in this paper we discuss an extensive set of optical , uv , and ir photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2010jl , together with interpretation of these observations .",
    "compared to other papers , our data set includes broader wavelength coverage , more extensive time coverage , and higher spectral resolution .",
    "we present a unique set of uv observations obtained with hst .",
    "x - ray observations and information about the progenitor from the literature enable us to provide a more complete picture of the event .",
    "in particular , we provide strong constraints on the structure of the progenitor and its environment .",

    "our main conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec - conculsions ] .",
    "based on the first detection we adopt 2010 oct 9 ( julian date 2,455,479 ) as the explosion date of the sn . with a recession velocity of the host galaxy 3207 @xmath43 @xcite , we adopt a distance to ugc 5189a of @xmath44 mpc in agreement with @xcite .",
    "most of the optical imaging was obtained with the 1.2-m telescope at the f. l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) using the keplercam instrument .",
    "keplercam data were reduced using iraf and idl procedures described in @xcite .",
    "a few additional late time epochs were obtained with the 6.5-m baade telescope at the magellan observatory using the imacs instrument and the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) using the alfosc instrument .",
    "these were reduced with iraf using standard methods .",
    "high quality not imaging was used to construct @xmath45- , @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-band templates by psf subtraction of the sn using the iraf daophot package .",
    "these templates were then subtracted from the flwo , magellan observatory and not imaging using the hotpants package .",
    "template subtraction is necessary to obtain accurate photometry after @xmath49100 days as the sn is located close to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the optical photometry was calibrated to the johnson - cousins ( jc ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) standard systems using local reference stars in the sn field , in turn calibrated using standard field observations on five photometric nights . as the sn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , in particular at late phases , is line - dominated , we have applied the technique of s - corrections @xcite to transform from the natural system of each instrument to the standard systems .",
    "this was done for all bands except the @xmath50-band .",
    "color - terms and filter response functions were adopted from @xcite for the flwo and from ergon et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the not .",
    "filter response functions for the jc and sdss standard systems were adopted from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the near - infrared ( nir ) imaging was obtained with the 1.3-m peters automated infrared imaging telescope ( pairitel ) at the flwo .",
    "the data were processed into mosaics using the pairitel mosaic pipeline version 3.6 implemented in python .",
    "details of pairitel observations and reduction of sn data can be found in @xcite .",
    "two additional late time epochs were obtained with not using the notcam instrument .",
    "this high quality imaging was used to construct @xmath51- , @xmath52- , @xmath53-band templates by psf subtraction of the sn using the iraf daophot package .",
    "these templates were then subtracted from the pairitel imaging using the hotpants package . as in the optical ,",
    "template subtraction is necessary to obtain accurate photometry after @xmath49100 days and is particularly important for the late @xmath51-band photometry .",
    "the nir photometry was calibrated to the 2mass standard system using reference stars from the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite within the sn field . as the pairitel was one of the two telescopes used for the 2mass survey the natural system photometry is already on the 2mass standard system and no transformation",
    "is needed .",
    "the not photometry was transformed to the 2mass standard system using linear color - terms from ergon et al .",
    "the absence of strong lines in the x - shooter nir spectrum indicates that this is sufficient and that s - corrections is not needed .    as a check we can compare with the j , h and k@xmath54 magnitudes from @xcite at 104 days .",
    "our j and h magnitudes agree within @xmath55 mag with those of andrews et al . however , our k@xmath54 magnitude close to this epoch is @xmath56 , while that of andrews et al .",
    "is @xmath57 .",
    "judging from the sed plot in andrews et al .",

    "our i magnitudes are @xmath115 mag fainter than the i magnitudes by zhang et al . and",
    "@xmath116 mag fainter in u compared to their u band .",

    "the nir light curves show a similar decline to the optical up to @xmath25 days .",
    "after this the light curves flatten considerably in j and h , while the k - band shows an increase compared to the flux at earlier times .",
    "the difference between the nir and the optical behavior is real and has important consequences for our physical picture for sn  2010jl . as we discuss in sect .",
    "[ sec_dust ] , we interpret this emission as coming from dust in the csm of the progenitor .    the pseudo - bolometric light curve for the flux in the wavelength range 3500 - 25000   was calculated using the method described in ergon et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . in the optical region where we have a well sampled spectral sequence",
    ", we made use of both photometry and spectroscopy to accurately calculate the bolometric luminosity , whereas in the nir region we used photometry to interpolate the shape of the sed .",
    "the sed has then been de - reddened using e@xmath104 mag from the milky way and e@xmath105 mag for the host galaxy , as derived in sect .",
    "[ sec - redd ] . for the milky way reddening we use the extinction law by @xcite and",
    "being a star forming galaxy with wr features @xcite we use the star burst extinction from @xcite for the host galaxy .",
    "as is clear from figure [ fig_photometry ] , the contribution from the nir bands becomes increasingly important .",
    "the luminosity in the nir region ( 9000 - 24000  ) is shown in figure [ fig_bollc ] as red points , whereas the total ( 3500 - 25000  ) luminosity is shown as black points . while the optical bolometric contribution starts to drop at @xmath117 days the nir part has a long plateau from 200 to @xmath118 days .",
    "at age 100 days , the ir represents 33 % of the flux , equaling the optical output at day 400 ; by age 500 days , it is 73% and by day 770 , 85% .",
    "this era is dominated by a dust contribution ( sect .",
    "[ sec_dust ] ) , and reflects both the instantaneous energy output and a contribution from a light echo . in sect .",
    "[ sec_dust ] we show that the sn itself dominates the nir at early epochs , while later the nir comes from an echo .",
    "the pseudo - bolometric light curve in figure [ fig_bollc ] only includes the optical and nir bands and ignores both the uv and midir . especially at the early phases ,",
    "the comparatively hot spectrum has a large uv contribution .",
    "we will discuss the spectra in more detail later ; here we only estimate this contribution from an integration of the flux from cos and stis for days 44 , 107 and 573 .",
    "we do not include the cos spectrum for day 621 because this is severely contaminated by the host galaxy .    on day 44",

    "we estimate the uncertainty in these fluxes as @xmath124 .",
    "there is therefore a substantial uv contribution to the bolometric luminosity especially at late epochs , up to @xmath125 of the optical luminosity at the last epoch .",
    "there may also be a substantial euv and x - ray luminosity that is not included in our observations .",
    "up to day @xmath25 our total bolometric luminosity agrees with that of @xcite .",
    "zhang et al . have , however , no nir ( or uv ) observations .",
    "these account for an increasing fraction of the luminosity as the event ages , so their luminosities are increasingly incomplete . in addition , the background contribution from the host is very important after day @xmath117 , as was discussed above . at early epochs",
    "there is some discrepancy between our bolometric luminosities and those of zhang et al .",
    "it is not clear what produces this difference : it may be due to zhang et al .",
    "using photometry alone , while we use a combination of photometry and spectroscopy to combine the bands .",
    "assuming that the luminosity is the same as at our first determinations at day 27 ( see below ) , we find a total integrated energy from day 0 to day 920 in the @xmath126   range of @xmath127 and in the @xmath128   range @xmath129 .",
    "the total in the @xmath130   range is therefore @xmath131 .",
    "the correct way to use the ir measurements depends on the interpretation ( sect .",
    "[ sec_dust ] ) and on the relative contributions between the photosphere emission and dust : nir light from an echo reflects the optical - uv output , while nir light from shock heated dust should be added to the energy budget .    to disentangle the dust and direct , photospheric luminosity from the sn we have made fits to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the photometry for most epochs",
    "we have here included the spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath26 m fluxes from @xcite at day 87 ( jd 2,455,565 ) and from @xcite for day 254 ( jd 2,455,733 ) , as well as unpublished spitzer observations from the spitzer archive from days 465 , 621 and 844 .",
    "for these epochs we find fluxes of 8.55 , 8.63 , 7.73 mjy at 3.6 @xmath26 m and 8.30 , 8.66 , 8.24 mjy at 4.5 @xmath26 m .",

    "we discuss the motivation for this choice of spectrum further in sect .",

    "the best fit parameters are for these models given in table [ table_dust_param ] for the different dates , and in figure [ fig_dust_tbb_rbb ] we show the blackbody temperature , radius and total luminosity of the dust and photospheric components from these fits , together with the standard deviations .",
    "the large errors in @xmath134 and @xmath135 at the first two epochs is a result of the dominance of the photospheric component also for the nir , while the errors in @xmath132 is mainly a result of the relatively few bands ( mainly b , v , i ) where there is a large contribution from this component .",

    "the reason for this , as can be seen in figure [ fig_sed ] , is that the photospheric contribution dominates the j , h and k bands for these epochs . at epochs later than the 465 day observation the opposite is true , which is a result of including the total dust emission from the blackbody fit and not only the nir bands .    already at @xmath142 days @xcite found from nir and spitzer observations an ir excess due to warm dust , but with a lower temperature of @xmath143 k than we find .",

    ", however , only include the spitzer fluxes to the dust component , while we include also the j , h and k bands in this component , explaining our higher dust temperatures .",
    "we note that @xcite underestimate the k - band flux in their sed fit .    using the sed fitting we can improve on the bolometric light curve by separating the sn and dust contributions of the ir flux to the bolometric luminosity and add this to the bvri contribution in figure [ fig_bollc ] .",
    "based on the uv flux at the epochs with hst observations we multiply this by a factor 1.25 ( sect .",

    "they find a flatter light curve with @xmath148 for the same explosion date as we use here .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the r - band decays slower than most of the other bands , as can be seen from fig .",

    "after the first observational gap between @xmath25 days and @xmath136 days the flux has dropped somewhat , and then drops by another factor of @xmath168 from 400 to 850 days . from the polynomial fit it is likely that the maximum h@xmath20 luminosity occurred at @xmath169 days when the sn was close to the sun .",
    "the bell shaped light curve of the h@xmath20 luminosity is in contrast to the continuum light curve in the same velocity region , shown as black dots , which decreases monotonically , and by a factor of @xmath170 from the first observations up to 800 days .",
    "the total luminosity ( continuum plus h@xmath20 ) remains nearly constant up to @xmath136 days , after which it too drops .",
    "the increasing flux in h@xmath20 during the first @xmath140 days explains the flatter light curve of the r band shown in figure [ fig_photometry ] .    for the first @xmath171 days",
    "our h@xmath20 luminosity agrees well with the total luminosity from the ` narrow ' and ` intermediate ' components of @xcite their terminology is different from that used in this paper .",
    "their ` narrow ' and ` intermediate ' components are both part of our ` broad ' , while their data do not resolve what we refer to as the ` narrow ' component .",

    "the broad ly@xmath20 absorption from the host galaxy makes it impossible to determine if any narrow emission is present .",
    "the red side of the broad component is relatively unaffected by absorptions and extends to @xmath178 .",
    "the blue side reaches into the damping profile of the host galaxy absorption .",

    "the lower flux of the ly@xmath20 line between @xmath180 and @xmath181 compared the h@xmath20 and h@xmath160 lines is caused by the overlapping ism absorptions , as well as the si iii @xmath97 line ( sect .",

    "because of the broad absorptions the total flux of the ly@xmath20 line can not be directly determined .",

    "we have plotted the ly@xmath191h@xmath160 ratio in figure [ fig_haflux ] as black dots .",
    "although the uncertainties in the ly@xmath20 flux are large , we see from these ratios that the broad line region has a balmer decrement , as well as a ly@xmath20/h@xmath20 ratio , very different from the recombination values .",
    "this is similar to what is found in the dense broad line regions in agns , and indicates a combination of high optical depths in the lines and high densities .",
    "models show that column densities of @xmath192 in combination with high densities , @xmath193 , are needed to get these ratios @xcite .",

    "the dust heating mechanism is , however , not clear .",
    "previous treatments of dust in type iin sne have discussed both heating by the radiation from the sn in combination with an echo and collisional heating by the hot gas behind the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we first discuss the case where the dust emission comes from dust which is collisionally evaporated by the shock of the sn . as discussed in next section , there is also direct evidence for such a velocity component in other type iin sne .",
    "massive dust shells into which the shock is propagating are also natural if the progenitor is an lbv .",
    "however , if we compare the shock radius with the evaporation radius at early epochs we find that even the lowest values of the latter , @xmath510 cm , is considerably larger than the shock radius at the first epochs , @xmath511 cm , where we have scaled to the velocity derived from the temperature of the x - rays .",
    "this radius should be seen as an upper limit to the shock radius .",
    "we therefore exclude this possibility .",
    "a more attractive alternative is based on an echo from radiatively heated dust , as has been discussed for other type iins .",
    "the plateau in the ir light curve between @xmath25 to @xmath118 days and slow decline thereafter ( figs .",
    "[ fig_photometry ] and [ fig_bollc ] ) would then be expected .",
    "also the energetics may be consistent with this .",
    "the integrated optical luminosity from the sn during the first @xmath136 days was @xmath512 ergs .",
    "in addition , there is a considerable luminosity in the uv , as well as at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this can be compared to the integrated luminosity in the dust component , which we estimate from the blackbody fits in figure [ fig_dust_tbb_rbb ] ; we find a total energy of @xmath513 ergs .",
    "there is therefore reasonable consistency between the energy emitted from the central source and that emitted by the dust .",
    "it does , however , require a large covering factor of the dust , as well as a high optical depth in these directions , which is consistent with the blackbody shape of the spectrum . as andrews",
    "discuss , this may indicate an anisotropic geometry ; they discuss torus models with different inclinations .    to explain the plateau as an echo",
    "the inner radius would have to be @xmath514 light days or @xmath515 cm , depending on the inclination of a disk or torus . at the same time",
    "the high temperature indicates that the inner radius is close to the evaporation radius .",
    "a radius of @xmath515 cm is , however , considerably larger that the estimates earlier for @xmath487 , even if the luminosity used for this estimate may be an underestimate , considering the fact that only the observed wavelengths were included , and also that the peak luminosity may have been before the first observations .",
    "a solution to this discrepancy may be that most of the emission comes from very small grains .",
    "some support for the presence of small grains in winds come from observations and modeling of the emission from some o - rich agb stars in the lmc , where a grain distribution with a minimum size of @xmath516 m to @xmath517 m gave the best fit @xcite .",
    "although the most appealing model , this scenario has some difficulties to simultaneously explain both the light curve and the high dust temperature , unless one stretches the parameters .",
    "we have calculated light curves from an echo from a spherically symmetric dust shell of inner radius @xmath518 cm . we , however , find that the rise of the light curve occurs too rapidly compared to the observed nir light curve in figure [ fig_bollc ] and the total dust luminosity in figure [ fig_dust_tbb_rbb ] .",
    "@xcite have studied echoes from asymmetric dust distributions . as shown in their figs . 2 and 3 , more disk like",
    "distributions give a considerably slower rise for low values of the inclination of the disk or torus .",
    "a low value of the inclination also agrees with the low reddening in the spectrum of the sn , while a high optical depth in the disk is needed for the high dust to sn luminosity , discussed above .",
    "even more asymmetric distributions with most of the dust behind the sn relative to our line of sight may also be consistent with the light curve , although we have not studied this quantitatively .",
    "the increase of the dust emitting area and simultaneous decrease of the dust temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig_dust_tbb_rbb ] ) are , however , qualitatively consistent with an echo , as the light echo paraboloid expands to larger radii into dust with decreasing temperature .    in the discussion about different dust emission mechanisms for type iin sne ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) proposed a scenario where pre - existing dust was radiatively heated by the radiation from ongoing circumstellar interaction . although the heating of the dust is radiative , echo effects are less important and the shell can be at a smaller evaporation radius , without invoking small grains .",
    "if the late luminosity , including all wavelengths , is of the same order as the maximum bolometric luminosity this may account for the high temperature observed .",
    "the main problem is that the luminosity of the late ir emission is high , @xmath519 at 500 days , while the optical flux from the sn is decreasing rapidly .",
    "this scenario would therefore require a very large euv - x - ray luminosity .",
    "there may be some indication of this from the h@xmath20 luminosity , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec - big ] .",
    "the profiles of the broad lines give important information about the structure of the envelope and the dynamics of the shock wave . as we discuss in the previous and next sections ,",
    "dust formation has severe problems in both the ejecta and in connection to the shock at early epochs due to the high luminosity and temperature of the radiation . instead ,",
    "the blueshift of the lines is more easily explained as a result of the line formation and dynamics in the outer parts of the extensive envelope / csm of the progenitor star , as was also suggested as a possible alternative by smith et al .",
    "as discussed in detail by e.g. , @xcite , for a radiation dominated shock in an extended envelope the radiation starts to escape when @xmath520 .",
    "the region outside the shock is therefore optically thick and line radiation emitted here will be compton scattered and can give rise to the broad wings observed , even if the emission is coming from regions which have not yet been accelerated by the shock radiation . only when the region with @xmath521 becomes accelerated will the macroscopic velocity become dominant",
    ".    an emission line undergoing electron scattering in a hot medium at rest will give rise to a symmetric line profile , since the velocity broadening is provided by microscopic , thermal velocities of the electrons @xcite .",
    "however , if the medium is moving with a bulk velocity towards us , this can introduce a blueshift of the line profile . for a spherically symmetric expansion one expects a redshift of the line peak @xcite .",
    "this is clearly not the case here .",
    "however , if the scattering medium is primarily moving coherently towards us one may instead get a blueshift of the peak , although still symmetric around the expansion velocity .",
    "we believe that this is the case here .",
    "we can test this interpretation quantitatively by first shifting each line in figure [ fig3b ] by a macroscopic velocity , @xmath522 , to the red .",

    "the lower velocity limit is chosen to avoid influence on the line profile by the narrow p - cygni absorption and emission , and the scattering wings of this emission .",
    "we treat @xmath522 as a free parameter , representing the macroscopic velocity of the emitting gas .",
    "the result of this procedure for a selection of days is shown in figure [ ha_shift ] .    from this figure",
    "we see that this simple , linear transformation results in nearly perfectly symmetric line profiles between the red and blue wings for essentially all epochs .",
    "this therefore argues that the blueshift in figure [ fig3b ] is due to a macroscopic velocity .",
    "in addition , the symmetric line profiles are a natural result of electron scattering . other processes , like dust or other absorption processes would result in asymmetric lines about the peak in flux , with a time dependent line shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "electron scattering in an expanding medium which is optically thick , however , naturally results in symmetric profiles , as demonstrated explicitly below .    in the upper panel of figure [ ha_hwhm ]",
    "we show with blue markers @xmath522 as function of time . in this panel",
    "we also show the velocity of the peak of the broad component as red markers . for the early epochs",
    "this agrees well with @xmath522 , but is somewhat higher for the later epochs .",
    "the broad agreement of these two determinations is another way of showing the symmetry of the line around the velocity shifted peak of the broad component .",

    "we have used an @xmath540 density and assumed that the photons are injected in the scattering region with an emissivity @xmath541 , as applies if recombination dominates the h@xmath20 emission . note that the narrow component of the h@xmath20 line is at the rest velocity of the galaxy and does not shift in velocity as the broad line becomes blueshifted , showing that these photons are not the dominant source for the scattering .",
    "the injected photons span a velocity range of @xmath542 , as expected for radiative acceleration ( see section [ sec_radacc ] ) , which decreases the un - scattered narrow peak , in agreement with the observations .",

    "this confirms that electron scattering dominates the line formation .",

    "@xcite argue for a dust origin based on the line shift , drop in luminosity and ir execss .",

    "we have applied a smoothing of @xmath545 to the spectra and normalized the fluxes to the same peak flux for the broad component and the same continuum level between @xmath546 .",
    "this is somewhat lower than for the determination of the continuum level of the h@xmath20 line in figure [ fig3b ] , but is necessary to avoid line contamination for h@xmath160 and pa@xmath547 as seen in figure [ ha_hb_hei_pb ] , this is even more serious for h@xmath161 and we have therefore scaled this line to the level of the other lines at the peak and at the maximum velocity where the line dominates , @xmath528 .",
    "the high spectral resolution makes it possible to isolate the narrow p - cygni component of the lines , which contaminates the low resolution line profiles of maeda et al .",

    "in contrast to @xcite and this paper , g14 interpret the nir dust emission as well as the blueshifts being caused by dust formed behind the reverse shock at an initial radius of @xmath555 cm .",
    "there is , however , a number of problems with this interpretation .",
    "first , it requires the shock to have reached this radius at their first observation , 26 days after peak or 66 days after first detection .",
    "this requires a shock velocity of @xmath556 . to support this g14 claim to see velocities up to @xmath557 from an assumed p - cygni absorption in h@xmath160 extending to this velocity .",
    "if this would be real , there would in that case also be an emission component up to a similar velocity , because the photosphere , assumed to be at @xmath558 , will only occult a small fraction of the ejecta .",
    "such a broad emission component is not seen .",
    "the only way around this is to assume that the ejecta is extremely asymmetric .",
    "the p - cygni absorption is instead likely to be the result of contributions by weaker emission lines bluewards of h@xmath160 .",
    "further , there are no indications from similar high velocities from any other lines",
    ". in particular , the ly@xmath20 line , being a resonance line , should show such absorption and emission if real . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_lprof_lya ] this is not the case . nor do any other of the uv resonance lines show such a component ( fig . [ fig_lprof_niv_civ ] ) .",
    "there are also other observations disfavoring similar high velocities .",
    "the analysis of the x - rays imply a velocity @xmath559 @xcite .",
    "the only direct evidence for high expansion velocities comes from nir spectra , where the he i @xmath42 line shows evidence for expansion velocities of @xmath560 between 100 - 200 days towards us @xcite .",
    "there are additional problems with the scenario in g14 .",
    "if the emission lines would be coming from the cool dense shell and absorbed by the dust formed in this the lines would be expected to have a boxy profile , not a symmetric profile peaked at low velocities .",
    "boxy profiles are indeed seen in objects like sn 1993j @xcite and sn 1995n @xcite , where the cool dense shell is believed to dominate the emission . also in objects where there indeed are strong indications for dust formation , like sn 1998s and sn 2006jc",
    ", the line profiles are less centrally peaked and more irregular @xcite .",
    "as we have shown , the line profiles are instead well characterized by that resulting from electron scattering .",
    "the mechanism behind the blueshift is not discussed in the g14 paper .",
    "it would , however , be surprising if this gave an intrinsically symmetric profile a simple shift in velocity , as we find , rather than a more irregular shape , given the expected clumping in a cold dense shell @xcite .    taken these results together , we therefore conclude that a cold dense shell at @xmath556 is unlikely and that the dust emission is instead coming from preexisting dust , as concluded by @xcite . if the shock velocity is much lower than @xmath556 the shock will be well inside the evaporation radius even for the large grains g14 propose , as table [ table_evap ] and also the estimates in g14 show .",
    "formation of the dust is then very difficult , as discussed before .",
    "we are also surprised that g14 exclude the h@xmath20 line in their analysis , given that this is by far the highest s / n line , and therefore best suited for this kind of analysis .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the asymmetry of h@xmath20 and other lines is sensitive to the assumed continuum level .",
    "a continuum subtraction has apparently not been done , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the claims for a strong asymmetry in h@xmath20 is therefore doubtful .",
    "instead , it can be seen from our fig .",
    "[ fig_full_stis_spec ] that h@xmath160 is considerably more complicated to analyze , with a number of interfering lines .",
    "g14 further argue against preexisting dust based of the high dust temperature observed .",
    "it is not clear what this is based on , and on the contrary this is a natural consequence of dust evaporation by the strong flux from the sn .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by @xcite .    taken together we therefore think the results regarding the dust formation and derived properties of this in g14 are highly questionable .",
    "based on this and our earlier discussion we exclude the dust alternative , and instead we believe that the line shifts are due to a bulk velocity of the scattering material .",
    "there are at least two possibilities for this .",
    "one alternative is that the velocity shift is caused by an increasing contribution of emission from the cooling gas behind the outgoing viscous shock .",
    "a possible scenario would be that at the first epochs the scattering optical depth in front of the shock is large enough that most of the line photons are emitted from un - shocked gas with low velocities .",
    "as the optical depth decreases an increasing contribution of the emitted photons will come from shocked gas behind the radiative forward shock .",
    "that this shock is indeed cooling is shown in sect .",
    "[ sec_energy ] .",
    "these photons will be scattered by electrons both in front and behind the shock , producing the symmetric wings of the lines .",
    "there will therefore be a gradual shift from zero velocity to the velocity of the shock of the line profiles .",
    "the main problem with this model is the high density in the post - shock gas .",
    "the forward shock is expected to be radiative .",
    "the temperature immediately being the shock will be @xmath561 k , but will cool down to @xmath562 k. the compression behind the shock will therefore be a factor of @xmath563 in density , implying a density of @xmath564 where the gas is cool enough to emit h@xmath20 and other low ionization lines .",
    "calculations discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec - big ] show that at densities @xmath565 the emission is in lte and thermalized , with a very low efficiency of conversion into line emission .",
    "most radiation will emerge as a blackbody continuum .",
    "the large h@xmath20 luminosity is very difficult to explain in this scenario .    in principle",
    ", the h@xmath20 emission could come from the unshocked ejecta , where the density is lower . from the swept up mass derived from the light curve ( eq .",
    "[ eq_mass ] below ) the column density of the cool shell is @xmath566 , meaning that all x - rays below @xmath567 kev will be absorbed in the shell . only the reverse shock will therefore be able to ionize this region .",
    "the luminosity of the reverse shock is only @xmath168 % of the forward shock , so there will be a serious problem with the energy .",
    "finally , it is not clear that a superposition of the emission from the pre - shock and post - shock gas will result in the observed symmetric profiles .    taken together , we believe that this explanation for the line shifts is unlikely .",
    "a different alternative is that the line shift is the result of acceleration of the pre - shock gas by the extremely energetic radiation field from the shock and thermalized optical radiation from the ejecta and cool shell .",
    "this has been discussed earlier in different contexts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no conclusive observational evidence has been found . as a simple model we consider an optically thin shell at a radius , @xmath568 , illuminated from below by the radiation field of the sn , having a luminosity @xmath569 . assuming that we can consider the radiation as radially free streaming , which should be a reasonable approximation at small optical depths close to the surface , the velocity is given by @xmath570 for @xmath571 we use the electron scattering opacity , @xmath572 , applicable for an ionized medium with a he / h ratio of 0.1 .    for the bolometric luminosity from the sn we use the result from figure [ bol_log_log ] , shown on a linear scale in the upper panel of figure [ vel_acc ] .",
    "the total radiated energy from the sn ( excluding the echo ) was @xmath573 ergs . using this energy and assuming a radius constant with time , we can estimate of the final velocity as @xmath574 .",
    "this estimate is , however , only approximate .",
    "the reason is that the hydrodynamic time scale of this gas is comparable to the length over which most of the energy is emitted , @xmath575 days .",
    "the increase of the radius of the shell must therefore be taken into account when calculating the velocity .",
    "this is really a hydrodynamic problem , which includes the interaction of the shell with the surrounding gas .",
    "we ignore the latter effects and treat the expansion as ballistic , calculating the radius as @xmath576 .",
    "the only free parameter is the initial radius , @xmath577 , of the emitting shell , which gives the normalization of the velocity .    for the best fit",
    "we find @xmath578 cm , resulting in a velocity as a function of time shown by the blue dots in the lower panel of figure [ vel_acc ] .",
    "given that there are uncertainties in the estimate of the bolometric luminosity , we find a good agreement with the observed velocity shift from figure [ ha_hwhm ] and shown as black dots in figure [ vel_acc ] . at epochs",
    "later than @xmath171 days there is a considerable scatter in the observed line shift , and it is difficult to judge if there is a slight decrease of the velocity , as may happen if there is a braking effect by the swept up csm . apart from the general agreement with the evolution of the velocity , it is also interesting that the initial radius which gives the best fit , @xmath579 cm , is close to that which gives the best fit to the photospheric radius from the blackbody fitting of the sed at the early epochs , @xmath580 cm ( table [ table_dust_param ] ) .",
    "the final radius after @xmath581 days is @xmath582 cm and the velocity @xmath583 .",
    "as we discussed in section [ sec_broad ] , an important constraint on the source of the h@xmath20 emission is the relation of the narrow unscattered line and the scattered wings , with the fraction of the former approximately given by @xmath584 for a planar geometry .",
    "because the typical optical depth required for the wings is @xmath585 , depending on the temperature , this would in general give a strong narrow line .",
    "this is indeed observed at early time , but disappears at later epochs at the same time as the blueshift starts ( figure [ fig3b ] ) . in this scenario",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the source of the h@xmath20 photons become increasingly spread out in velocity , reflecting the local , accelerated velocity , but now spanning an increasing velocity range .",
    "the peak flux will decrease with the increasing velocity of this material , as observed .",
    "one therefore obtains a consistency check between the flux of the unscattered emission and the velocity shift .",
    "note that the narrow csm line most likely comes from a different , more distant component than the broad lines , based on its constant velocity and different flux evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig_narrowha ] ) .",
    "the velocity of this radiatively accelerated material is considerably lower than the @xmath529 one infers from the x - rays . after a time @xmath586 years",
    "the shock will sweep up the accelerated shell . for",
    "this not to happen too early , the shock velocity interior to the h@xmath20 emitting shell has to be below @xmath530 , depending on the velocity of the accelerated shell , corrected for the los angle . as discussed earlier , a reason for a lower shock velocity may be that the shell is anisotropic with the highest column density where the broad lines arise .",
    "the shock velocity will then be lower than that inferred from the x - rays , which are likely to come from directions of lower column density ( see next section ) .",
    "the mass of the accelerated gas does not need to be large and is likely to be small .",
    "the scattering layer only has to have a @xmath587 , corresponding to @xmath588 , where @xmath47 is the radius of the shell and @xmath589 the solid angle of the shell .",
    "to accelerate it to @xmath590 only takes @xmath591 ergs , which is small compared to the total radiated energy .",
    "most of the mass in the csm is instead in the optically very thick region inside the accelerated layer .",
    "the high luminosity , @xmath592 at maximum , and large total radiated energy , @xmath593 ( section [ sec_phot_results ] ) , require an efficient conversion of kinetic to radiative energy . in section [ sec_dust ]",
    "we argued that the flux from the optical and nir up to @xmath117 days is dominated by the direct flux from the sn , while most of the nir flux is from the echo after this epoch .",
    "we now discuss the energetics in terms of the shock propagation through a dense envelope .",
    "the shock breakout for extended sne has been discussed by several authors @xcite . for large optical depths",
    "the shock will be radiation dominated with a width @xmath594 @xcite . @xcite estimate the diffusion time scale of the csm , assumed to have @xmath595 , as @xmath596 here @xmath597 is the mass loss rate and @xmath598 is the wind velocity , and @xmath571 the opacity . for the mass loss rates we derive below",
    "this is likely to be short for the epochs of interest here .",
    "as the shock approaches the surface at @xmath599 a viscous shock will form ( for a discussion see * ? ? ?",

    "based on the shock velocity derived by @xcite we scale this and the following estimates to a shock velocity at 320 days , @xmath607 , of @xmath608 .",
    "note that this velocity may vary with the direction if the mass loss rate is anisotropic ( see below ) , as we argue .",
    "this gives a density immediately behind the forward shock of @xmath609 which leads to @xmath610 therefore , the forward shock should be radiative for several years as long as the shock is in the high density shell .",
    "further , assuming that the ingoing x - ray flux from the shock is thermalized in the ejecta and cool shell behind the shock , the blackbody luminosity is given by @xmath611 .",
    "an equal amount will partly be absorbed and ionize the pre - shock gas and partly escape as the observed x - ray flux . using this luminosity for the radiation density",

    "the break at @xmath502 days in the light curve can either be caused by the break - out of the shock through the dense shell , or as a result of a transition to a momentum conserving phase , occurring when the swept up mass is comparable to the ejecta mass @xcite .",

    "we assume that the ejecta with a velocity @xmath529 dominates the energy input to the optical light curve .",

    "the shock velocity in the x - ray obscured regions may , however , be considerably lower ( eq . [ eq_vshock ] ) . the mass loss rate above , as well as the total mass lost ,",
    "should therefore be considered as lower limits .",
    "note , however , that while the mass loss rate scales with the velocity of the csm , the total mass lost is independent of this parameter .",

    "the main reason for this is that they are scaling to a higher wind velocity of @xmath626 , while we find @xmath627 .",

    "it is clear that they all have very dense csm into which the shock waves are propagating . at least for sn 2009ip there is evidence for pre - existing dust which may have been formed a few years before the last eruption @xcite , like sn 2010jl .",
    "the main differences between these objects and sn 2010jl is that the latter showed a considerably higher peak luminosity , slower decay and an order of magnitude higher total radiated energy compared to sne 2009ip and 2010mc .",
    "we therefore believe that the basic mechanism for these objects is different from that in sn 2010jl .",
    "the fact that no very broad lines with velocities typical of core collapse sne were seen for sn 2010jl is less important .",
    "as we have already argued , this is mainly an effect of different mass loss rates and total mass lost .      in this section",
    "we summarize the main points of the previous discussion and discuss how this information can be put together in a coherent scenario for sn 2010jl .",
    "most of the bolometric luminosity is produced by the radiation from the radiative shock with a velocity of up to @xmath529 , which propagates through the dense csm resulting from a mass loss rate of @xmath703 and a velocity of @xmath225 , which may be the result of a previous lbv - like eruption .",
    "the total mass lost is @xmath704 .",
    "the ingoing x - rays from the shock will be thermalized at early epochs in the dense shell behind the shock and later in the ejecta .",
    "this will there be converted into uv and optical continuum radiation with a spectrum close to a blackbody .",
    "most of the outgoing x - rays will be absorbed by the pre - shock wind and will there give rise to uv and optical emission lines .",
    "an important issue is the relative location of the source of the uv and optical line emission and the electron scattering region .",
    "the fact that the strong high ionization uv lines , like the n iv ] , c iv , n iii ] lines , at early epochs had strong electron scattering wings besides the narrow component , shows that at least a large fraction of these arise in or interior to the electron scattering region .",
    "the same is true for the balmer lines . as we have already discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_csm ] , the narrow lines most likely arise in a more extended region outside the denser part of the csm . because the velocity to which the gas is accelerated is @xmath705 ( eq .

    "[ sec_csm ] ) .    to explain the broad wings of the lines the electron scattering optical depth of this csm has to be @xmath707 .",
    "the mass loss rates we find correspond to a total optical depth to electron scattering of a wind with outer radius @xmath708 @xmath709 if completely ionized . from this",
    "it is clear that to get large enough @xmath710 either the shock velocity has to be lower than that corresponding to the x - ray temperature , @xmath529 , or that the mass loss rate in these directions is higher than the average , or most likely both , as we discuss in the end of this section .    one can estimate the extent of the ionized region , assuming that most of the x - ray and euv emission from the cooling shock is absorbed by the csm in front of the shock , and will there give rise to a strmgren zone ( see e.g. , @xcite for a similar situation ) .",
    "we also assume that the x - rays emitted inwards are thermalized by the cool shell and ejecta , resulting in optical and uv emission , but only contributing marginally to the ionization .",

    "the x - ray temperature was 10 kev and we studied a range of shock luminosities and mass loss rates .",
    "a problem is here that for the most interesting parameters the electron scattering optical depth is larger than unity ( eq .",

    "nevertheless , the qualitative results are interesting .    with regard to the efficiency of x - ray to h@xmath20 conversion",

    "the efficiency decreases rapidly due to thermalization of the h@xmath20 line . the electron density we infer from the bolometric luminosity in sect .",
    "[ sec_energy ] is for @xmath723 @xmath724 which is in the range where we expect a high h@xmath20 efficiency .",
    "further , the observed maximum h@xmath20 luminosity was @xmath725 ( figure [ fig_haflux ] ) .",
    "although we find that there is some contribution from the photospheric emission from ionizations in the balmer continuum , the observed h@xmath20 luminosity implies a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath726 .",
    "there is therefore a rough agreement between the bolometric luminosity , h@xmath20 luminosity and a high h@xmath20 efficiency .",
    "compared to this the observed level of x - rays is @xmath727 @xcite .",
    "this is by itself no problem , because most of the x - rays may be absorbed by the pre - shock gas , and is in fact needed to explain the uv emission lines .",
    "a major problem is , however , that , as discussed in the introduction , the x - rays at 59 days indicated a column density of @xmath728 , decreasing to @xmath729 at 373 days .",
    "this only results in a redistribution between the cno elements , which have similar cross sections and ionization thresholds .",
    "as discussed later , we do not find any other indication of processing .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that , except for a different host metallicity , the standard conversion between x - ray absorption column density and n@xmath730 , and therefore electron scattering depth , applies . ] .",
    "this column density corresponds to an electron scattering depth of @xmath731 , which is too low to explain the line profiles in the optical .",
    "there are several possible explanations to this discrepancy .",
    "@xcite argue that the column density could be decreased by a higher ionization due to a large electron scattering optical depth . as we argue above , the optical depth of the _ ionized _ gas is limited and the effect will not be dramatic .",
    "instead we believe that the different column densities are due to large scale asymmetries in the outflow , giving rise to different column densities in different directions .",
    "alternatively , it could be due to small scale inhomogeneities resulting in a leakage of x - rays in the low density regions .",
    "this is also supported by the low column density @xcite found from their nustar + xmm observations at @xmath37 days .",
    "we discuss further evidence for these possibilities below .    for a wind , most of h@xmath20 originates close to the shock , as can be seen from @xmath732 .",
    "this is also the region of largest optical depth to electron scattering .",
    "emission and scattering therefore take place in the same region , although some of the h@xmath20 emission also occurs at low optical optical depths , resulting in a narrow line core as long as the bulk velocity of the emitting material is low ( sect .",

    "the temperature in the h@xmath20 emitting zone is @xmath736 k.    a related model is discussed by @xcite who calculate the line formation in type iin sne with application to sn 1994w .",
    "although the authors point out that this is only a preliminary attempt and related to a specific scenario , this is the only self - consistent modeling of the line formation we are aware of .",

    "dessart et al .",
    "also point out a number of useful signatures , depending on the relative location of the region where the balmer emission originates and the electron scattering region .",
    "in particular they find that if the photons are internally generated , h@xmath20 , h@xmath160 and h@xmath161 form at increasing optical depth .",
    "the electron scattering depth also increases for these lines , leading to increasingly strong wings for h@xmath160 and h@xmath161 compared to h@xmath20 .",
    "if the lines , on the other hand , are created outside the scattering region they are expected to have similar line profiles .    in principle",
    ", these possibilities can be tested with our observations . the limited s / n and relatively steep balmer decrement makes it difficult to see any differences between these line profiles .",
    "the best set of line profiles are from our spectrum from x - shooter in figure [ ha_hb_hei_pb ] .",
    "this does show some minor differences in the width of the lines , but these are sensitive to the exact way the continuum is subtracted as well as to blending by other lines .",
    "the latter is especially important for the he i @xmath42 line , which is blended with pa@xmath161 ; the red wing of h@xmath160 also shows indications of blending .",
    "it is therefore premature to draw any firm conclusions .    as argued in sect .",
    "[ sec_radacc ] , we believe that the bulk velocity of @xmath738 of the balmer emitting region is a result of the pre - acceleration of the circumstellar material in front of the main shock by the intense radiation from the thermalized radiation from the shock . this is supported by the agreement between the observed velocity evolution and that predicted from the evolution of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "a surprising result is that to produce the line shift of the h@xmath20 line we required that most of the emitting material was moving with similar velocity relative to us .",
    "this in turn requires the flow to subtend a fairly small solid angle .",
    "the expansion does , however , not necessarily have to be in our los , which would increase the true expansion velocity by @xmath739 , where @xmath740 is the angle between these directions .",

    "the scenario we infer from the observations has many qualitative similarities to the one calculated by @xcite . using 2-d hydrodynamical simulations they have calculated the interaction of a core collapse sn with a dense circumstellar shell ejected 2 years before explosion .",
    "the total shell mass was in most cases @xmath748 , while the ejecta mass for this shell mass was varied between @xmath749 .",
    "models with both spherical geometry and a density and mass distribution similar to the bipolar structure observed for eta carinae were calculated . optically thin cooling , but no radiative transfer , was included . at the time the shock collides with the shell the shock velocity is @xmath750 , for the chosen parameters , but decreases to 1000 - 2000 @xmath23 in the shell , depending on mass of ejecta , shell mass and sn energy . because of the large density and low velocity , implying a shock temperature of @xmath751 k",
    ", the shock becomes radiative . after the shock has penetrated the shell the velocity again increases and the shock then in most cases becomes adiabatic .",
    "this evolution illustrates what happens when a sn with normal energy interacts with a dense csm .",
    "the low shock velocity resulting from this is in line of what is observed for sn 2010jl .    in their bipolar simulations ( models d01-d03 )",
    "the ejecta first interact with the equatorial region and then later with the polar region . because of the smaller column density in the equatorial direction the shock penetrates this region first at which time the shock temperature increases rapidly . in the polar direction it takes a considerably longer time for the shock to reach the outer boundary of the shell and",
    "the shock velocity is also lower .",
    "this may illustrate the range of velocities which may be present in an anisotropic csm , and which may explain the different column densities inferred from the x - rays and the electron scattering wings , discussed above .",
    "these anisotropic models demonstrate nicely how one can have both high shock velocities ( in the equatorial directions ) , giving rise to hard x - rays , and slow shocks still in the optically thick circumstellar shell ( in the polar directions ) at the same time .",
    "the drop in luminosity during the breakout phase is in the bipolar models @xmath752 , where @xmath753 ( figure 16 in * ? ? ?",
    "this depends on the parameters of the models , but is at least in qualitative agreement with the observations , which show that @xmath754 after the break ( sect .",
    "[ sec_phot_results ] ) .    for the spherical models in @xcite the light curves in general consist of a rapid rise when the shock encounters the shell and a slowly decreasing plateau .",
    "as the shock has passed the outer shell , there is a rapid drop as the shock becomes adiabatic . because of the gradual emergence of the shock with latitude the bipolar case results in a smoother evolution of the light curve without the same sharp break as the spherical shell .",
    "this result depends on the angular dependence of the column density .",
    "a stronger concentration to the poles would give a sharper drop of the light curve , in line of what we see in sn 2010jl .",
    "the efficiency in converting kinetic energy into radiation was found to be in the range @xmath755 , decreasing with increasing ejecta mass and expansion velocity of the shell ( determining the distance of the shell from the sn ) . with an efficiency in this range",
    "the radiated energy of @xmath573 ergs would correspond to an explosion energy of @xmath756 ergs .",
    "the fact that we do not see evidence for expansion in the opposite direction is a natural result of the obscuration of this region by the optically thick material in the core of the sn and from the ionized material exterior to this moving towards us .",
    "the decline in the flux at late epochs is a result of the decrease in the photospheric radius ( see table [ table_dust_param ] ) , which in principle might indicate that the extent of the photosphere is not large enough to obscure the receding side of the sn .",
    "however , the photospheric radius is the thermalization radius which must be deep inside the @xmath757 radius . in our last spectra at @xmath758 days",
    "the optical depth to electron scattering is likely to be @xmath759 .",
    "the obscuration of the back - side of the sn by the scattering region even at late epochs is therefore not a problem .",
    "as we have already discussed , at the late epochs the shock should have penetrated the dense circumstellar shell in the low column density regions close to the equator , while it is still inside the optically thick region in our line of sight , although outside the photosphere .    with regard to the narrow lines we note that a steady wind with a mass loss rate of @xmath760 , as in the quiescent state in eta carinae , and wind velocity of @xmath761 corresponds to a density of @xmath762 @xmath763 , which is similar to what we find from the nebular diagnostics of the narrow lines for sn 2010jl , but below that of the balmer lines",
    ". a larger radial extent of the narrow line region , as indicated from the ionization parameter ( sect .",
    "[ sec_csm ] ) is natural in this context .",
    "the deep absorption component in the p - cygni profile of the narrow h@xmath20 line ( figure [ fig3b ] ) means that this material must have an appreciable covering factor of the underlying emission from the sn .",
    "the emission component of this , as well as the depth of the absorption , tends to decrease with time .",
    "this may be a result of the expansion of the sn relative to the slow csm .",
    "an example of this kind of evolution can be seen in the analytical models in figure 5 of @xcite , where the relative size of the scattering layer to the photospheric emission is varied .",
    "the dust shell , giving rise to the echo , is at a considerable larger distance , @xmath764 cm .",
    "the high temperature and large distance argues for small dust grains . to reproduce the nir light",
    "curve the dust should have an anisotropic distribution .",
    "the dust is likely to have been formed in previous mass loss phases of the progenitor , as seen in eta carinae .    finally , we remark that even in our last full spectrum at @xmath765 days there is no clear transition to a nebular stage , although the spectrum is dominated by emission lines , with h@xmath20 by far the strongest line , rather than continuum emission ( figure [ fig_fast_spec ] ) .",
    "electron scattering is apparently still important in the line emitting region , and there are no signs of any processed material in even the last spectrum .",
    "this may in principle speak in favor of the pure lbv scenario without core collapse . because of the extreme mass loss rate the hydrogen envelope is , however , likely to still be opaque to the emission from the core ( sect .",
    "[ sec - comp ] ) .",
    "we will therefore have to wait until the optical depth is low enough for any firm conclusions .",
    "as discussed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the extremely luminous type iin sne , with absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath766 , may arise from ejections where the ejected shell has not expanded to more than a few @xmath745 cm , resulting in a dense , optically thick shell .",
    "this would correspond to sn 2010jl . ejected shells which have expanded to larger radii , and therefore have lower density and optical depth , would give rise to more ` normal ' type iins , like sne 1988z and 2008iy , with absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath767 .",
    "these are also expected to be strong x - ray and radio sources , in contrast to the more luminous type iins . as we discuss in sect .",
    "[ sec - comp ] , the mass loss rate and its duration may be the most important parameters distinguishing these properties .    although we have in this paper mainly discussed our results in terms of conditions around lbvs , the standard lbv scenario has a number of problems in explaining the type iin sne .",
    "in particular , the high frequency of type iins may be incompatible with very massive progenitors and also the evolutionary state of the lbvs may be a problem .",
    "recently there have been different suggestions , discussed below , addressing these problems .",
    "one should note that the lbv interpretation is mainly phenomenological , based on observational characteristics like the very dense csm , the cno processing and the typical velocities for the csm .",
    "it has also been suggested that a large fraction of type iin sne may arise as a result of explosions in red supergiants with enhanced mass loss @xcite , which would alleviate these problems .",
    "a single star version has recently been put forward by @xcite based on a moderately fast rotating star with a mass @xmath768 .",
    "the average rotational velocity on the main sequence was @xmath769 for these models .",
    "the rotation in combination with mixing results in a more massive he - core than for a non - rotating star .",
    "this has the consequence that the star ends up as a hot supergiant , with effective temperature @xmath770 k , and with a thin hydrogen envelope . the heavy mass loss in the red supergiant and final hot phase results in a dense csm .    the most interesting result in the paper by groh et al .",
    "is that a full nlte atmospheric calculation of the hydrostatic and wind regions in the final phase gives a spectrum similar to that of an lbv , with a large number of emission lines .",
    "because of heavy mass loss and mixing , cno products are transported to the surface , with essentially complete cno burning .",
    "their 20 @xmath28 model has n / c = 128 and n / o = 16 at the end of c - burning .",
    "these are considerably higher than our determination for sn 2010jl , including the uncertainty in these . as discussed by groh et al .",
    ", this could perhaps be explained by he - burning products mixed to the surface .",
    "it may , however , also indicate less complete cno burning , as is e.g. , seen in the @xmath771 models by @xcite .",
    "these lower mass stars , however , end their life as red supergiants , not lbv - like objects . a dense csm may nevertheless be present , but the wind velocity would probably be lower than we observe .",
    "the mass loss rate groh et al .",
    "find for the @xmath768 models in the pre - sn phase is @xmath772 and wind velocity @xmath773 .",
    "the wind velocity is considerably higher that what we find for sn 2010jl . scaling to a lower wind velocity this mass loss rate corresponds to an electron density of @xmath774 , where @xmath47 is the radius of the line emitting material .",
    "we have assumed a he / h ratio of 0.8 by mass @xcite .",
    "depending on the mass loss rate and radius of the line emitting gas , this may be compatible with what we observe for the narrow lines from the csm in sn 2010jl",
    ". however , there are large uncertainties in this estimate . first , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec - fluxes ] and [ sec_broad ] , there is considerable uncertainty in the radius of the line emitting gas . also , the mass loss rate of the models is highly uncertain since , as @xcite remark , these stars are close to the eddington luminosity .",
    "an increased mass loss is therefore not unexpected , as discussed by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the mass loss rate could also have been higher in the previous red supergiant phase , further boosting the density of the csm at large radii .",
    "rotational effects could also make the mass loss highly anisotropic .",
    "overall , we find that given these uncertainties there is at least some rough agreement between the models and our observations",
    ". this scenario may therefore solve the evolutionary and rate problems , while at the same time at least qualitatively explain the observational lbv characteristics .",
    "a major issue is to explain the mechanism behind the outbursts needed to explain the dense inner shell .    as a second alternative , based now on a binary model ,",
    "@xcite has proposed a merger scenario , where a compact companion in the form of either a neutron star or a black hole may merge with a normal companion star .",
    "the energy released by the in - spiraling will release a large energy into the envelope of the companion star , resulting in heavy mass loss .",
    "a dense csm will therefore result , mainly concentrated to the orbital plane of the binary .",
    "this may have implications for the line profiles , but a more definite comparison is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we also remark that an lbv - like eruption may also be the result of a merger or possibly only a tight binary encounter in a lower mass system",
    ". this would then be in better agreement with the relatively high frequency of type iin sne . the high luminosity would , however , be difficult to understand .",
    "a third scenario is discussed by @xcite based on convective motions connected to the carbon burning and later stages when the core luminosity is super eddington .",
    "this turbulence in turn excites internal gravity waves which may convert a fraction of their energy into sound waves .",
    "these finally dissipate their energy and cause mass loss from the stellar envelope .",
    "the advantage with this model is that it directly connects the stellar explosion and strong mass loss of the progenitor .",
    "@xcite have developed this further and made predictions for the duration of the wave - driven mass loss , as well as the total mass lost .",
    "most of the mass loss occurs in the ne and o burning stages , which limits the duration to @xmath775 years before explosion . only for stars with he - core masses below @xmath776 , or zams masses below @xmath777",
    "do they find substantial mass loss , with a total mass lost between @xmath778 . while the wind velocity we find , @xmath225 , is close to the escape velocities of their models , the total mass lost in the wave - driven phase is substantially lower than what we find for sn 2010jl . with a duration of @xmath775 years also",
    "the extent of the dense shell , @xmath779 cm , is on the low side .",
    "although interesting in that this scenario directly connects the heavy mass loss phase with the explosion , many details connected to the conversion efficiency , effects of binary interaction etc .",
    "are uncertain and require numerical work along the lines of @xcite to test this scenario .",
    "@xcite have recently discussed the consequences of instabilities from turbulent convection in the latest burning phase , which may trigger strong mass loss just before explosion .",
    "sn 2010jl represents the best observed type iin supernova to date , and in addition one of the brightest . in this paper",
    "we have combined our optical , nir and uv observations with x - ray observations to get a full view of this sn in both time and in wavelength .",
    "our most important conclusions are :    * we have presented one of the most complete data set of any type iin sn , covering the uv , optical and ir range .",
    "it also represents a nearly complete coverage in time from the explosion to @xmath758 days . *",
    "we find a large number of narrow uv , optical and nir lines from the csm from both low and very high ionization stages , including coronal lines , most likely excited by the x - ray emission from the sn shock wave .",
    "the uv lines provide strong evidence for cno processed gas in the csm , with n / c@xmath780 and n / o=@xmath781",
    ". the density of the csm and distance to the narrow line emission are consistent with observations of lbvs in our galaxy . *",
    "the expansion velocity of the csm makes red supergiants unlikely as progenitors , but is consistent with lbvs . * the profiles of the broad lines",
    "are symmetrical in the co - moving frame up to @xmath758 days , with a shape typical of electron scattering , but are shifted by an increasing velocity to @xmath738 along the line of sight .",
    "the profiles of the broad lines show no strong evidence of wavelength dependence , as would be expected if dust was responsible for the shift of the broad lines . instead",
    ", the shift of the broad lines which develop at late stages is explained as a result of the bulk velocity of the gas , rather than as a result of dust in the ejecta .",
    "* we find that the most likely explanation for the velocity shift is radiative acceleration by the flux from the sn .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the large radiated energy of this sn in combination with the gradual release of this . * the optical depth needed to produce the electron scattering wings ,",
    "the low and coherent bulk velocity inferred from the velocity shifts together with the comparatively low x - ray column densities and the high x - ray temperature provide strong evidence for an asymmetric shock wave , with both varying velocities and column density , consistent with what is inferred from polarization measurements at early epochs . a bipolar outflow from an lbv a few years before the explosion would be compatible with these observations ,",
    "although we can not exclude a one - sided asymmetry . *",
    "the nir dust excess is likely to originate from an echo at a distance of @xmath782 cm in the csm of the sn .",
    "the dust is heated by the radiation from the sn to nearly the evaporation temperature .",
    "the high dust temperature and large distance may require a small grain size . * the expansion velocity of the csm is @xmath225 and the mass loss rate has to be @xmath783 to explain the bolometric light curve by circumstellar interaction .",
    "the total mass lost is @xmath704 .",
    "these numbers are likely lower limits , depending strongly on the uncertain shock velocity and anisotropies in this .",
    "* there are no indications of a nebular stage , or any processed material even at @xmath765 days .",
