    "lower bounds on the resonance counting function ( which imply the existence of the resonances ) are typically much harder to prove .    the purpose of this paper is to prove optimal lower bounds on the order of growth of the resonance counting function for generic metrics in a class of manifolds hyperbolic near infinity . here",

    "hence the main challenge lies in the odd - dimensional case .",
    "our work here draws on two principle sources : first , sjstrand and zworski s @xcite construction of an asymptotically euclidean metric whose resonance counting function obeys a lower bound of the form @xmath13 , and second , the techniques developed by christiansen @xcite , @xcite , and christiansen - hislop @xcite to prove lower bounds on the resonance counting function for generic potentials and metrics .    sjstrand and",
