    "<S> we present a microresonator - based system capable of simultaneously producing time - advanced and time - delayed pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is based on the combination of a sharp spectral feature with two orthogonally - polarized propagating waveguide modes . </S>",
    "<S> we include an experimental proof - of - concept implementation using a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered optical fiber and use a time - domain picture to interpret the observed delays . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss potential applications for future all - optical networks .    </S>",
    "<S> increasing bandwidth demands are pushing for the development of all - optical circuitry that will be able to quickly and reliably transmit and process vast amounts of data . </S>",
    "<S> precise control of light propagation , such as the ability to advance , delay , or store a pulse transmitted through a waveguide , is a requisite ingredient for optical data processing in photonic circuits@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , exotic optical phenomena occurring in the presence of strong spectral dispersion such as slow@xcite and fast@xcite light have been found very useful for achieving these goals , generating a surge of experimental activities aimed at realizing fast or slow light in different media : atomic vapors@xcite , crystals@xcite , semiconductors@xcite , and microresonators@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these demonstrations have shown either fast or slow light for a given configuration . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a microresonator - based system that is capable of simultaneously producing time - advanced and time - delayed pulses , including an experimental proof - of - concept implementation .    the ability to simultaneously slow and advance pulses of light brings about a new perspective on photonics : one can easily envision applications involving all - optical processing of data headers and data packets where both fast and slow light may be desirable . </S>",
    "<S> time - advanced signals can be used to compensate time delays inevitable in any complex optical - processing network@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appeal of strong spectral dispersion is not limited to the linear properties of light : the resulting high optical energy compression may lead to extraordinary enhancement of nonlinear effects and , one day , to single - photon applications for quantum computing and communications . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental implementation uses a silica microsphere evanescently coupled to a tapered optical fiber@xcite as the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> light polarization plays an important role in the experiment as the enabling tool for achieving fast / slow light and also provides an additional degree of freedom available for data storage and/or processing .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been known for a long time that media with sharp spectral features can modify the group speed of light propagating through them@xcite , resulting in subluminal or superluminal propagation of pulses . </S>",
    "<S> more recently it has also been established that systems where two modes can propagate can also show anomalous dispersion , even in the absence of absorption or reflection@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been shown in photonic crystals@xcite and coupled mode systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our system combines both approaches , using a coherent linear superposition of two propagating modes where only one of them shows a sharp spectral feature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to produce , out of a single incident pulse , two mutually orthogonal pulses of comparable intensity : one time - delayed and another time - advanced with respect to the incident pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a resonator ( microsphere ) strongly coupled to a waveguide ( optical fiber ) and assume that the incoming light is incident with a polarization at @xmath0 degrees from the resonator s natural polarization axis , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schem ] . </S>",
    "<S> an analyzer selects the polarization component parallel to the incoming one ( @xmath1 ) or orthogonal to it ( @xmath2 ) . assuming that only one of the natural polarizations of the fiber - microsphere system exhibits resonant transmission features , the intensity transmitted through the waveguide can be written for each of the output polarizations as@xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the single - pass resonator attenuation and phase - shift , respectively , and @xmath7 with @xmath8 representing the coupling coefficient between the waveguide and the resonator .     and @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the incident field @xmath10 polarization is oriented halfway between the two axis . </S>",
    "<S> a polarizer at the output selects either the polarization parallel to the incoming one ( @xmath1 ) or the perpendicular one ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) optical microscope picture showing a microsphere close to a tapered optical fiber.,width=309 ]    calculated transmission and phase spectra for each one of the output polarizations are shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : theo_pol ] for the case of a slightly overcoupled resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the parallel polarization shows clear absorption and anomalous dispersion at resonance , while the perpendicular one shows gain and normal , but steep , dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis using vectorial kramers - kronig relations@xcite suffices to realize that the light coming out with the analyzer set at @xmath1 will show a negative group delay , while there will be a positive group delay for the orthogonal polarization . using a polarization beamsplitter instead of an analyzer the incoming pulse </S>",
    "<S> can be split into two , with one of the child pulses advanced in time and the other delayed .    ) . at resonance , </S>",
    "<S> a fraction of the radiation has its polarization rotated by 90 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) phase spectrum for both polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the parallel polarization shows anomalous dispersion near the resonance , while the perpendicular one shows normal but steep dispersion.,width=309 ]    previous theoretical work@xcite used the frequency - domain approach outlined above to indicate positive and negative group delays are possible for transmission through a waveguide coupled to a resonator , but this is not the only possible approach . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the pulse arrival time can also be explained from a time - domain perspective that matches quite well the time - domain nature of the experimental implementation . in this view , one of the pulse s polarization components </S>",
    "<S> is coupled to the resonator ( and is thus subjected to dispersion coming from the frequency - dependent transmission coefficient in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : tau ] ) while the other travels straight through the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the resonator causes the coupled pulse to be temporally distorted@xcite , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theo_time]a . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent addition of the coupled and uncoupled pulses results in a time - varying polarization at the output . </S>",
    "<S> when projecting this polarization into the parallel or orthogonal axis , the detected peak is either advanced or delayed in time with respect to the original one , illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theo_time ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 component is affected by the resonator , while the @xmath12 one is not . </S>",
    "<S> the input pulse is polarized along @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) calculated transmitted pulses for the parallel and orthogonal polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the parallel pulse is advanced in time , while that of the perpendicular pulse is delayed.,width=309 ]    the ratio between the amplitudes of the advanced and delayed polarizations ( as well as the corresponding group delays ) can be adjusted by changing the coupling between the resonator and the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> when the resonator is undercoupled , the polarization conversion is weak and the output mostly conserves its original polarization ; the negative group delay is small , since the output is dominated by the uncoupled pulse . at critical coupling , both output polarizations are equally transmitted , albeit with a total loss of half the input field . </S>",
    "<S> operation in the strongly overcoupled regime maximizes the negative group delay ( temporal advancement ) of the parallel polarization and reduces the overall loss . </S>",
    "<S> however , very strong polarization conversion@xcite significantly reduces the amplitude of the transmitted parallel polarization while maximizing that of the orthogonal polarization . to simplify the measurement , </S>",
    "<S> we ve chosen an intermediate case of a slightly overcoupled fiber - resonator system .    </S>",
    "<S> changing the input polarization will also result in a different ratio of transmitted amplitudes ( and group delays ) . </S>",
    "<S> the largest ( both positive and negative ) group delays are obtained for an input polarization of 45 degrees at the expense of a somewhat reduced transmission amplitude for the parallel polarized light . for applications where a higher transmission of this component is desirable , using an input polarization of @xmath13 degrees ( as suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) would increase this transmission at the expense of smaller achievable group delays . </S>",
    "<S> we choose an input polarization of @xmath0 degrees in our experiments to maximize the observable delays and bring them into the range measurable with our existing instruments .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiments were done on a silica microsphere with a @xmath14 diameter , fabricated from a single - mode optical fiber using a @xmath15 laser . </S>",
    "<S> a tapered optical fiber@xcite acted as the evanescently coupled waveguide ( the interaction length between the fiber and the sphere , equivalent to the optical device length was estimated to be on the order of @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling strength was controlled by adjusting the relative positions of the the sphere and fiber with a piezoelectric stage . </S>",
    "<S> using a tunable diode laser we could find a reasonably sharp resonance , shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trace]a . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate this resonance to have mode numbers@xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18 and an unloaded q factor near @xmath19 .    setting the input polarization approximately at 45 degrees </S>",
    "<S> , we sent short gaussian pulses ( @xmath20 ) generated by an electro - optic modulator into the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> we used a polarizer at the output of the fiber to set the @xmath21 analyzer angle at @xmath22 , and a fast photodiode connected to a digital oscilloscope to record time traces of the field intensity . </S>",
    "<S> proper control of the polarization at the resonator and the output was very important for the experiment , so we used two polarization controllers to compensate for fiber birefringence , one before the resonator and one after it . when the resonator and fiber were brought closer together and the incident light in resonance with the selected mode , </S>",
    "<S> the effected group delays were noticeable in the measured traces . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trace]a shows traces for both values of @xmath21 together with a reference trace taken with the resonator uncoupled from the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse peak is advanced @xmath23 ns with respect to the reference in the parallel trace , while it is delayed by @xmath24 ns in the orthogonal trace . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the changes in the arrival times for both delayed and advanced pulses are much larger than what would be expected for as a normal transit time through the device length . from this </S>",
    "<S> we can infer that the orthogonal polarization experienced a large group index causing a delay , while for the parallel polarization the peak of the pulse left the resonator before entering it ( the corresponding group indices are @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that both the delayed and advanced signals are of comparable intensities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> calculations using the time - domain picture , including losses to higher order fiber modes of @xmath27 , show a reasonable agreement with the data .     and </S>",

    "<S> inset : spectrum of the unloaded cavity resonance used in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) observed group delay measured for different laser frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) experimental transmission spectra complementing the group delay data in panel b.,width=309 ]    [ fig : delayvsf ]    both positive and negative group delays are intrinsically narrowband phenomena , with a bandwidth given by that of the resonant mode . </S>",
    "<S> as such , only pulses with a carrier frequency matching that of the mode will be affected . figure  [ fig : delayvsf]b corroborates this , showing that the delays become smaller as the laser frequency sweeps away from the resonance center ( the corresponding transmissions are displayed in fig .  [ fig : delayvsf]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> narrow bandwidth is also responsible for some distortion of pulse shapes . as with all passive single - mode - based delay lines , </S>",
    "<S> the delay - bandwidth product is limited.@xcite our high - q resonators maximize the delay at the expense of bandwidth , another choice intended to make the delays measurable with our existing instruments , and thus our bandwidth is too narrow to allow for applications at large modulation rates . besides , free - standing microspheres are not easy to integrate on photonic circuits . </S>",
    "<S> other resonator systems , such as silica microtoroids@xcite or silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) microrings@xcite or silica could be better suited for integration . in particular , microfabricated soi resonators have broader linewidths and could work at higher modulation rates ( at the expense of smaller induced group delays ) . </S>",
    "<S> using chains of microfabricated resonators@xcite might be a way to sidestep that limitation .        </S>",
    "<S> the state of the polarization at the resonator is also important to obtain the desired group delays@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical model predicts significant conversion for the overcoupled system when the incoming polarization is at 45 degrees@xcite , so we use the presence of a strong polarization conversion effect when the coupling increases as an indicator that the polarization at the resonator is close to 45 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> we can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : conv ] that the conversion becomes more pronounced as the coupling increases ( and @xmath29 decreases ) , giving us a confirmation that our incoming polarization is acceptably close to the desired one .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally demonstrated that microresonator - loaded optical fibers can be used to split an incident pulse into mutually orthogonal output pulses experiencing positive and negative group delays . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon can be explained in both the spectral domain , through generalized kramers - kronig relations and the time domain , via a resonator - induced polarization change . </S>",
    "<S> this capability could prove useful for the implementation of photonic circuits in all - optical networks , for instance compensating processing - induced delays . </S>",
    "<S> other applications such as single - photon devices for quantum computation and communication are also within the realm of possibilities . </S>"
