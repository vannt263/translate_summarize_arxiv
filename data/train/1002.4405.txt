    "we calculate @xmath176 by considering a simple 3 parameter fisher matrix consisting of @xmath13 , @xmath173 and spectral index @xmath184 , and marginalizing over @xmath184 .",
    "more parameters need to be included for a careful study , but this simple analysis suffices to show the degree of correlation between the parameters .",
    "we consider two cases with excess optical depth : ( i ) dark matter annihilation at high redshifts ( with @xmath39 = 50 gev , no halos ) with the standard recombination coefficient , and ( ii ) no dark matter , but a smaller recombination coefficient as in eq .",
    "( [ mod ] ) ( with @xmath185 = 0.985 ) . for the @xmath21 power spectrum",
    ", we find for case ( i ) , a correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath173 of @xmath186 . for case ( ii ) , we find @xmath187 .",

    "the exact values of @xmath176 and @xmath191 will be different when more parameters are included .",
    "however , this simple calculation shows that @xmath13 and @xmath174 are strongly degenerate .",
    "we also see that the effects of dark matter annihilation can not easily be distinguished from an alternate recombination theory .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the corresponding polarization power spectra .",
    "we verify that reducing @xmath173 has almost no effect on the large angle polarization power .",
    "thus , while the dark matter model can not be separated from the standard scenario using the @xmath21 power spectrum when @xmath173 is variable , they are easily separable using @xmath2 polarization data provided instrument noise is not a limiting factor . also shown is the large angle @xmath17 power spectrum .",
    "one sees that the @xmath2 power spectrum is more useful than the @xmath17 power spectrum for distinguishing models , provided quality @xmath2 data exists for @xmath192 .",
    "the contribution due to dark matter halos mostly affects multipoles @xmath192 , while annihilation of free dark matter at high redshifts influences the multipoles @xmath7 .",
    "an ideal , cosmic variance limited observation would be able to place constraints on both the halo model , as well as particle physics parameters .",
    "the planck experiment is expected to be cosmic variance limited up to @xmath193 @xcite and have good signal to noise up to @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "the cmbpol experiment is expected to perform even better .",
    "these future experiments may be able to distinguish between different reionization models , and place constraints on dark matter halos as well as particle parameters .",
    "in this article , we have looked at how dark matter models influence the cmb polarization power spectrum , and whether current , and future observations can be used to distinguish dark matter reionization models from the standard theory .    in section",
    "ii , we briefly reviewed dark matter annihilation resulting in ionization and heating , and derived an expression for the energy absorbed per gas atom @xmath56 .",
    "we also considered inverse compton scattering of high energy charged particles with the cmb , resulting in lower energy photons ( fig .",
    "1 ) . when the inverse compton process is efficient , @xmath56 can be expressed in a much simpler form . at very high redshifts ,",
    "@xmath56 can be further simplified since most of the released energy is absorbed close to the redshift of particle annihilation . in this regime ,",
    "the ionization directly probes @xmath109 , where @xmath97 is the fraction of energy transported by electromagnetic processes . in section iii",
    ", we discussed the optical depth contribution at different redshifts and the resulting cmb polarization power spectrum .",
    "we first considered dark matter annihilation at high redshifts @xmath6 , both with and without residual electrons ( fig .",
    "2 , table 1 ) . taking residual electrons into account makes dark matter annihilation less effective except for very small particle masses .",
    "we then considered dark matter annihilation at all redshifts , and calculated the ionization history for different dark matter masses , and concentration parameters ( fig .",
    "we also considered the temperature power spectrum , and showed that it is not as useful as the polarization power spectrum in distinguishing different reionization scenarios ( figs 4,5 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 power spectrum is more sensitive to reionization than the @xmath17 power spectrum .    in this article",
    ", we have restricted ourselves to the case of a thermal relic with cross section @xmath195 @xmath196s . however , dark matter annihilation at high redshifts probes @xmath197 and thus , our results are valid for a wide range of masses , for corresponding annihilation cross sections .",
    "we considered the effect of different particle masses , as well as different concentration parameters .",
    "the halo contribution which is dominant for @xmath4 affects the low multipoles @xmath198 in the polarization power spectrum , while free dark matter annihilation at redshifts @xmath148 primarily affects multipoles @xmath7 .",
    "we first looked at dm model # 1 with @xmath199 gev and @xmath200 , and compared it with a 2-step standard reionization model ( model a ) .",
    "the effect of dark matter is not seen in the large angle polarization , even with cosmic variance limited data up to @xmath201 .",
    "dark matter annihilation becomes important when the particle mass is decreased .",
    "we considered two models with @xmath165 gev , with concentration parameters @xmath202 and @xmath200 ( dm model # 2 , and dm model # 3 respectively ) . with cosmic variance limited data up to @xmath203",
    ", dm model # 2 and dm model # 3 may be distinguished at high significance from model a. thus future cmb polarization measurements might allow us to put constraints on light ( on the weak energy scale ) dark matter candidates and on models with an enhanced annihilation cross section .",
    "current large angle cmb polarization measurements are consistent with a standard baryonic reionization theory .",
    "future experiments such as planck would be able to shed more light on the physics of reionization .",
