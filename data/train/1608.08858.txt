    "in a quantum theory of scattering with all states being unlocalized plane - waves , the cross section @xmath7 is known to be independent of the phase @xmath8 of a transition amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "it is so as long as we neglect finite sizes of the wave packets and beams , their spreading during the collision , and suppose that the momentum uncertainties @xmath10 are vanishing .",
    "but for several important exceptions @xcite , this approximation works very well . on the other hand",
    ", this phase turns out to be of high importance for hadronic physics , especially for @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions , where it is extracted from interference between the coulomb- and the hadronic parts of the transition amplitude ( see , for example , @xcite and also @xcite for a modern review ) .",
    "the function @xmath13 is calculated within different models , including regge approaches , and it is believed to depend in a complex way on the energy and on the transferred momentum .",
    "this phase has recently been extracted from the measurements by the totem collaboration at the lhc at @xmath14 tev @xcite , and it has been found that , in agreement with the unitary considerations , the amplitude becomes mostly imaginary for the small scattering angles @xcite . a further analysis of the data showed , however , that at large transferred momenta a real part of the amplitude can dominate @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the observables become sensitive to the phase @xmath8 if one lays aside the simple but unrealistic plane - wave approximation and treats all the particles as spatially- and temporarily localized wave packets .",
    "if a ratio @xmath5 with @xmath1 being a width of a particle beam is a small parameter , then for a generic @xmath15 scattering ( or annihilation ) process the cross section , @xmath16 , represents a series in powers of @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the ( non - plane - wave ) number of events and the luminosity , respectively , @xmath20 is the standard plane - wave cross section .",
    "this first correction to the latter , @xmath21 , vanishes in the plane - wave limit when either @xmath22 or @xmath23 and turns out to depend upon the phase @xmath8 , on the impact parameter @xmath24 between the centers of the beams ( we imply a head - on collision for simplicity ) , and on the overall complex phases , @xmath25 , of the wave functions , @xmath26 , of the initial beams with the mean momenta @xmath27 . to be more precise",
    ", the cross section depends upon a combination @xmath28 as we demonstrate below , one can probe the phase @xmath8 , or rather its derivative @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , by comparing cross sections with a flipped sign of @xmath31 .",
    "this can be realized either by swapping the beams , i.e. @xmath32 ( see fig.[fig ] ) , or by changing the signs of the phases @xmath33 .",
    "whereas the ( conventional ) gaussian beams are needed in the first scenario , the second one requires more sophisticated quantum states .",
    "the beams carrying complex phases , i.e. @xmath34 , are not plane waves , even approximately , because their wave fronts have non - trivial topology , and their wave functions in configuration space may turn out to be non - gaussian , even if those in the momentum space are so . depending on these phases , such states may represent vortex particles carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam ) with respect to their average propagation direction and possessing the wave front that looks like a corkscrew @xcite , the so - called airy beams @xcite , as well as their generalizations @xcite .",
    "these novel quantum states were experimentally realized for photons , for electrons with the energy of @xmath35 kev and , more recently , for neutrons @xcite .",
    "they have already found numerous applications ",
    "see , for example , refs.@xcite .",
    "the phase of a vortex electron , for instance , looks like @xmath36 with @xmath37 being an azimuthal angle and @xmath38 is the oam .",
    "that is why change of the phase sign can be obtained by flipping the oam , @xmath39 .",
    "a key quantity of interest in this study is a scattering asymmetry , which appears because the cross section is neither even nor odd in @xmath31 .",
    "it is only moderately suppressed , @xmath40 , in both the methods we discuss , thanks to the broken azimuthal symmetry in the initial state . for elastic scattering ( say , @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) , this results in the lack of up - down symmetry in the angular distributions of scattered particles .",
    "although the predicted values of this asymmetry stay small , less than @xmath43 for electrons with intermediate energies and even lower in the ultrarelativistic case or for heavier particles , measurements of the angular dependence of final particles can in principle answer the question of how the phase @xmath8 changes with the scattering angle or with @xmath3 .",
    "the system of units @xmath44 is used .",
    "let us consider a @xmath15 head - on collision of two beams with the mean momenta @xmath27 , their uncertainties @xmath45 , the spatial widths @xmath46 , with the overall phases of the wave functions ( in momentum representation ) of each particle in the beams @xmath25 , and let the centers of the beams be separated by a distance @xmath24 ( impact - parameter ) .",
    "we do not imply an elastic scattering , and the amplitude @xmath47 is supposed to be an analytical- and a smooth function . a quantitative measure of a contribution of the phase @xmath8 to the number of scattering events @xmath48 is the following _ asymmetry _ @xmath49 - dn[-{\\bm b}_{\\varphi}]}{dn [ { \\bm b}_{\\varphi } ] + dn[-{\\bm b}_{\\varphi } ] } = \\frac{d\\sigma [ { \\bm b}_{\\varphi }",
    "] - d\\sigma[-{\\bm b}_{\\varphi}]}{d\\sigma [ { \\bm b}_{\\varphi } ] + d\\sigma[-{\\bm b}_{\\varphi } ] } , \\label{eq01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , in contrast to the number of events itself ( see the appendix ) , has a simple analytical form in the paraxial regime . indeed , in the chosen kinematics the asymmetry can depend only on the following vectors : @xmath50 , @xmath31 , @xmath51 , and it must be a linear function of the two latter ones . the only true scalar that satisfies these criteria is @xmath52\\right ]   \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\zeta_{fi}}{\\partial \\langle{\\bm p}\\rangle_{2 } } -\\frac{\\partial \\zeta_{fi}}{\\partial \\langle{\\bm p}\\rangle_{1}}\\right ) + \\mathcal o(\\sigma_b^{-4 } ) , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath53 , and the vector @xmath54 is averaged with the gaussian distributions , @xmath55 .",
    "a small parameter of this series appears to be @xmath56 or just @xmath57 for wide beams with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this approximation is realized in the majority of practical cases .",
    "say , for the lhc proton beam with @xmath60 m and the monochromaticity of @xmath61 @xcite , we have @xmath62 . on the other hand , for non - relativistic beams",
    "the situation with @xmath63 is also possible ( see below ) , and in this case again @xmath64 .",
    "as can be seen , the asymmetry vanishes in the plane - wave limit when either @xmath23 or @xmath22 .",
    "of course the main formula of this study , eq.([eq1 ] ) , can also be rigorously derived from the general expression for the scattering events  see the appendix .",
    "the averaging of @xmath31 has appeared because some phases @xmath33 may not be analytical in the entire @xmath65-domain , but contain a finite number of removable singularities .",
    "say , for vortex beams with @xmath36 the derivative @xmath66 is not analytical for a vanishing transverse momentum .",
    "this singularity , however , is removable and the mean value of this , @xmath67 simply vanishes when @xmath68 . note that the number of events ( [ eq6alt ] ) itself is suppressed as @xmath69 when @xmath70 .",
    "the asymmetry ( [ eq1 ] ) depends on the momenta of final particles and in order to measure it , one should compare the outcomes of two experiments with a flipped sign of @xmath71 .",
    "this could be realized in the following two ways :    * by swapping the two incoming beams with no phases whatsoever , that is , by @xmath72 ( see fig.[fig ] ) ; * by changing the signs of the phases , @xmath73 ( say , by @xmath74 ) , with the zero impact - parameter .    in what follows",
    "we shall discuss these means in detail .",
    "note that eq.([eq1 ] ) was obtained within the perturbation theory with @xmath75 ; that is why all the corrections due to the phases are supposed to be small anyway , that is , @xmath76 or , at the best , @xmath77 .",
    "otherwise this expression is inapplicable .    for",
    "a special case of a @xmath78 head - on collision in the centre - of - mass frame of particles with the same masses and the momentum widths @xmath79 ( say , @xmath42 or @xmath80 ) , we find : @xmath81}{{\\bm u}^2}\\ , \\frac{\\partial\\ , \\zeta_{fi}}{\\partial t } , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have put @xmath82 . note that @xmath83 , and that is why @xmath84 does not contribute here . from eq.([eq2 ] ) we infer that for the strictly forward scattering , @xmath85 , the asymmetry vanishes .",
    "in the first scenario with the two ( in fact , not necessarily gaussian ) beams with no phases , one can put @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 in this case we find from eq.([eq2 ] ) : @xmath90 this asymmetry is only linearly suppressed by @xmath1 and its pre - factor has a simple @xmath91 dependence on the scattering angles @xmath92 . any deviation of the measured asymmetry from this dependence",
    "would be an evidence of a non - trivial phase @xmath93 .",
    "-axis , @xmath94 . in the second scenario ,",
    "the impact parameter @xmath24 is zero , but the wave packets carry complex phases and their signs are changed .",
    "[ fig],width=453 ]    a rough numerical estimate of the asymmetry can be obtained for elastic scattering in the ultrarelativistic case with @xmath95 .",
    "assuming that the phase is a fast function of the scattering angle @xmath96 , but a slow one of @xmath0 , we get @xmath97 and it is @xmath98 if @xmath99 . as we have seen , it is the factor @xmath100 that determines sensitivity to the phase variation with the scattering angle and we wish to increase it . for protons , it is less than @xmath101 even for moderately relativistic beams focused in a spot of the order of @xmath102 m and less than @xmath103 for protons with @xmath104 mev and focused to @xmath105 nm @xcite .",
    "the estimate ( [ eq6a ] ) , however , is inapplicable in the latter case .    for electrons , the value @xmath106 can be achieved with the beams of @xmath107 mev focused in a spot of @xmath108 nm , which seems to be challenging for current technology .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio @xmath5 becomes bigger than @xmath43 for @xmath109-kev electrons focused in a spot of the order of @xmath110 @xcite ( regardless of the oam ) , even though the estimate ( [ eq6a ] ) is again hardly applicable for such energies . in this scenario ,",
    "we bring two sub - nm - sized electron beams into collision ( note that in this case @xmath111 ) , slightly off - center , and that is why we ought to be able to control their relative position with the accuracy better than @xmath112 . then the angular distributions of scattered electrons are measured and compared in the upper- and in the lower semi - spaces .",
    "their difference reveals itself in the asymmetry and its conservative estimate is @xmath113 which is in principle measurable with high statistics .",
    "whereas for relativistic energies the value of @xmath114 becomes even lower , one could increase it by making the impact parameter very large , @xmath115 .",
    "the price is , however , a drop in the number of events due to the overall envelope @xmath116 in eq.([eq6alt ] ) .",
    "note that this asymmetry is a purely quantum effect that vanishes in the plane - wave limit and might seem to be counter - intuitive from a classical perspective .",
    "indeed , for a pair of azimuthally symmetric wave packets their substitution clearly does not alter the ( classical ) cross section .",
    "this property is violated when either the packets are not - azimuthally symmetric ( the @xmath117 scenario ) or the particles themselves have some inner structure ( atoms , ions , hadrons ) .",
    "it is the latter case in which the phase @xmath8 comes into play .",
    "within the second scenario , we start with a head - on collision of two vortex beams with @xmath118 , the phases @xmath119 , @xmath38 , and the opposite signs of their orbital helicities @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of such beams is no longer gaussian but has a doughnut shape with a minimum on the collision axis ( see details in @xcite ) . still working in the frame with @xmath120 ,",
    "we find with the help of eq.([mean_value ] ) : @xmath121 this vector vanishes , together with the asymmetry , when either the total oam of the system is zero , @xmath122 , or the azimuthally symmetric pure bessel beams with @xmath87 collide .",
    "clearly , this happens because in order to have a non - zero @xmath114 the azimuthal symmetry of the problem _ must be broken _",
    ", exactly as in the previous example",
    ".    with vanishing impact - parameter , violation of the azimuthal symmetry can be achieved by shifting the phase vortex off the symmetry axis of the beam .",
    "when dealing with the holograms ( as in refs.@xcite ) , a shift of a fork dislocation off the beam center provides a ( small ) azimuthal asymmetry or , in other words , a non - vanishing transverse momentum ( see details , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "such a shift is to be small , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and it is made to opposite directions for both beams . to put it simply , in this scenario a non - vanishing transverse",
    "momentum plays the same role as does a finite impact parameter in the first one . as a result",
    ", we have the following estimate from eq.([eq2 ] ) : @xmath125 the major difference between this expression and eq.([eq6 ] ) is appearance of the factor @xmath126 , which can be very large .",
    "it might seem therefore that the second scenario with @xmath127 provides a much higher value of the asymmetry .",
    "however the price for this increase is again the drop in statistics due to the factor @xmath128 in eq.([eq6alt ] ) .",
    "as production of twisted hadrons with the azimuthally non - symmetric profiles seems to be more technologically challenging than it is for electrons , we turn to elastic scattering of the latter . by analogy with eq.([eq6a ] ) , the factor @xmath129 determines sensitivity to the asymmetry in relativistic case .",
    "the maximum value of the oam for which the number of events is not suppressed is @xmath130 and that is why @xmath131 exactly as in the previous scenario .",
    "taking again @xmath109-kev twisted electrons focused to @xmath132 , with the monochromaticity of @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , we arrive at the same dependence ( [ eq8b ] ) when @xmath135 . in order to measure the asymmetry ,",
    "the angular distributions of scattered electrons are to be compared in the two experiments with @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "as before , one can alternatively carry out only one experiment with @xmath136 in which the angular distributions in the upper- and in the lower semi - spaces are compared .",
    "the numerical estimate ( [ aestim ] ) stays valid .",
    "since for such a study we need vortex electrons with the azimuthally asymmetric profiles , we would also like to find such states for which the requirement of a non - vanishing transverse momentum can be relaxed .    as can be readily seen",
    ", it is the case for airy beams as their azimuthal distribution itself is not symmetric . for collision of two such states with @xmath87 , the phase @xmath138 , and the opposite signs of their parameters @xmath139 ,",
    "we find : @xmath140 where we have used @xmath141 .",
    "the typical values of @xmath142 follow from the factor @xmath143 in the probability formula .",
    "that is why @xmath144 in any case , this yields the same @xmath145 factor in the formula for asymmetry as in eq.([eq6 ] ) and @xmath5 for relativistic energies and elastic scattering .",
    "therefore the use of airy beams leads to the very same predictions for the asymmetry as in the previous examples .",
    "the idea of using vortex states for probing the phase of the amplitude was put forward by ivanov @xcite . by analogy with his work ,",
    "let us consider now scattering of a light particle by a heave one ( say , @xmath146 ) with @xmath147 .",
    "working in the frame in which the longitudinal momentum of the heavy particle is zero , we assume the light one to be in the pure bessel state with @xmath148 .",
    "we obtain that the asymmetry , @xmath149 does not depend on the oam @xmath150 of the light particle and , compared to eq.([eq8 ] ) , has an additional small factor @xmath151 , which is less than @xmath43 for the available beams .",
    "this factor also appears for the airy beams when @xmath152 but @xmath153 .",
    "that is why the higher values of the asymmetry favor the case with @xmath154 , in accordance with the ref.@xcite .",
    "the difference between the two methods described above can be elucidated by comparing two ways of colliding two rubber balls .",
    "if the balls are pumped up well , they are azimuthally symmetric and in order to violate this symmetry in scattering we need to collide them slightly off - center .",
    "conversely , when the balls are deflated they are most likely no longer azimuthally symmetric and that is why they can collide even at a zero impact parameter .",
    "one simply needs to imagine a wave packet with a non - trivial wave front instead of such a deflated ball .",
    "as we have demonstrated , the number of events and the cross section in a general scattering process become sensitive to the overall phase of the scattering amplitude in a more realistic model with the incoming particles described as wave packets .",
    "this phase reveals itself in the up - down angular asymmetry when either impact - parameter between the two beams is non - vanishing or the beams have non - trivial wave functions , that is , carry complex phases . in both these scenarios , violation of the azimuthal symmetry of the problem , which does not take place in the plane - wave approximation ,",
    "yields a non - vanishing contribution of the phase @xmath8 .",
    "the asymmetry is only linearly attenuated with the beam width , @xmath155 , and for the special case of elastic scattering and relativistic energies it decreases with the momentum and has a small dimensionless factor @xmath156 , regardless of the scenario .",
    "one can generalize this conclusion to other non - plane - wave quantum states by observing that the maximum value of the parameters entering the phase @xmath157 is determined from the following inequality @xmath158 which is just analogous to @xmath159 .",
    "this puts a natural limit on the number of events and , consequently , on the asymmetry .",
    "a non - trivial phase @xmath8 , either coulomb- or hadronic one , is known to originate from the loop diagrams ( see , for example , @xcite ) and , therefore , it is of the order of the small parameter of the perturbation series itself .",
    "whereas for available non - relativistic proton beams the ratio @xmath160 does not exceed @xmath103 , the corresponding estimate for asymmetry is even lower .",
    "this is obviously beyond the experimental possibilities , even putting aside inseparability of the pure hadronic- and coulomb contributions .",
    "on the other hand , elastic scattering of the electrons with intermediate energies of hundreds of kev and focused to @xmath110 @xcite allows one to expect a much more pronounced effect for the coulomb phase .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath161 on a one - loop level @xcite , and that is why for small scattering angles : @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "this estimate is in accordance with that of the recent paper @xcite .",
    "corresponding experiments , albeit being on the frontiers of current technology , could be performed at modern electron microscopes , both with the gaussian beams and with the vortex- and/or airy ones if the beams are focused to a spot of less than @xmath110 in diameter .",
    "i am grateful to e.akhmedov , i.ivanov , p.kazinski , v.serbo , o.skoromnik , a.zhevlakov and , especially , to a.di piazza for many fruitful discussions and criticism .",
    "i also would like to thank c.h.keitel , a.di piazza and s.babacan for their hospitality during my stay at the max - planck - institute for nuclear physics in heidelberg .",
    "this work is supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation and by the competitiveness improvement program of the tomsk state university .",
    "according to kotkin _ _ et al.__@xcite , the scattering probability in the general non - plane - wave case represents a functional of the ( generalized ) cross section @xmath164 ( note that @xmath165 ) and a function that we shall denote @xmath166 and call _ the particle correlator _ : @xmath167 where @xmath168 ^ 2 } , \\cr & \\displaystyle   \\varepsilon_f = \\sum\\limits_{i=3}^{n_f+2}\\varepsilon_i ( { \\bm p}_i),\\,\\ , \\varepsilon ( { \\bm p } ) = \\sqrt{{\\bm p}^2 + m^2},\\ { \\bm p}_f = \\sum\\limits_{i=3}^{n_f+2}{\\bm p}_i,\\,\\ , { \\bm u}_{1,2 } = { \\bm p}_{1,2}/\\varepsilon_{1,2 } ( { \\bm p}_{1,2 } ) , \\label{ma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath169 is a particle s wigner function @xcite with the following properties : @xmath170 one can define an effective cross section by dividing the probability by a luminosity @xmath171 , @xmath172 it is this quantity that we are going to compare the plane - wave cross section with .    for a pure state , the wigner function is ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath173 where @xmath174 . as an example",

    "we imply that the mean distance between the particles in the beams , @xmath186 , does not exceed the coherence length @xmath182 , i.e. @xmath187 . the result of the averaging is @xmath188 where the relative impact parameter of the two beams , @xmath189 is introduced and @xmath190 note that in the majority of practical situations , the beam is much wider than a single wave packet , @xmath191 , and hence @xmath192 . as a result",
