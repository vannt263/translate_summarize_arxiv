    "another interesting property is the occurrence of the super - inflationary phase induced by quantum effects @xcite .",
    "this phase is in fact not long enough to explain the observed flatness of the universe , but after this phase the universe has proper initial conditions to start the standard slow - roll inflation . in this scenario",
    "a inflaton field firstly climbs up the potential hill and then stops before a slow - roll phase , producing the running of the spectral index @xcite .",
    "the production of scalar perturbations during super - inflationary phase is investigated in the papers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the transition from the quantum to classical universe through the super - inflationary phase .",
    "because during this transition the main contribution to the energy of the inflaton field comes from the kinetic part , in calculations , we neglect the contribution from the potential energy .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that the super - inflationary phase inducted by lqg is a generic property and does not depend on a kind of the field which fills the universe . for analytical considerations we solve dynamical equations in the semi - classical and classical regimes and",

    "we investigate numerically effects of loop corrections . neglecting quantum corrections to equation for tensor modes and holding underlying loop dynamics we study analytically creation of gravitons .",
    "we calculate the spectrum of tensor perturbations during the super - inflationary phase and the density of gravitons produced during the transition from the semi - classical to classical universe .",
    "such gravitons give contributions to the stochastic background of gravitational waves . nowadays the detectors like ligo @xcite aim at the detection of these stochastic gravitational waves @xcite .",

    "these modes bring an information from earliest stages of the universe .",

    "unfortunately available data from cmb or from large scale structures observations are not sufficiently precise to determinate value of the tensor spectral index .",
    "in the previous section we derived and investigated equation for tensor modes ( [ tensormodes3 ] ) . using approximations we also calculated the spectrum of gravitons which cross the horizon during the super - inflationary phase .",
    "now we want to calculate a number of gravitons which are produced during the transition from the quantum to classical regime of evolution .",
    "before we start it , let us calculate the width of the band of produced gravitons .",
    "it can be directly taken from condition @xmath68 .",
    "we use the classical approximation for the evolution of tensor modes for it preserves the physical picture of the graviton creation process as the previous numerical investigations indicate . in this approximation ( @xmath38 ) we have a maximum of frequency for @xmath40 , so with the use of equation ( [ evol1 ] ) we have @xmath84 in fact , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pumpfield ] , this frequency is generally higher .",
    "the corresponding maximal frequency for the present epoch is @xmath85 to estimate this value we can approximate @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the planck temperature .",
    "the other way to estimate value @xmath88 is to use the friedmann equation with radiation .",
    "this gives equation @xmath89 where we use solution ( [ evol2 ] ) to calculate @xmath90 . to obtain a numerical value",
    "we must know @xmath40 .",
    "we use here the constraint for energy in the form @xmath91 @xcite ( the kinetic energy dominates over the contribution from the potential part as we mentioned before ) for @xmath92 . below the value of chosen @xmath93",
    "the space becomes discrete and the smooth dynamical equations can not be used .",
    "the boundary for the kinetic energy is introduced to prevent energies beyond the planck scale being produced . with use of this boundary conditions and the friedmann equation ( [ fried1 ] ) with solution ( [ evol2 ] )",
    "we obtain the constraint for the conformal time @xmath40 @xmath94 as an exemple for the model with @xmath47 and @xmath46 we obtain @xmath95 and for the model with @xmath96 and @xmath46 we obtain @xmath97 .",
    "we see that this boundary depends very strongly on the quantum numbers .",
    "combining equation ( [ numax ] ) with ( [ aa ] ) we see that @xmath98 , so the boundary ( [ bound1 ] ) gives us also the upper constraint for a maximal value of frequency @xmath0 .",
    "for the model with @xmath47 and @xmath46 we have @xmath99 hz and for the model with @xmath96 and @xmath46 we obtain @xmath100 hz . generally values of @xmath0 can be smaller than boundary values . for the further studies we choose the model with @xmath101 .",
