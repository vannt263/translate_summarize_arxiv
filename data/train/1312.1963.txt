    "the dicke hamlitonian describes a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms interacting with a single monochromatic electromagnetic radiation mode within a cavity @xcite . in terms of quantum computation",
    ", it can also describe a set of @xmath0 qubits , realized with quantum dots , bose - einstein condensates or qed circuits @xcite , interacting through a bosonic field . in recent years",
    "dicke - like hamiltonians , and in particular its quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from normal to superradiant behavior @xcite , have attracted much attention .",
    "the qpt is an example of a quantum collective behavior and has a close connection with entanglement and quantum chaos .",
    "besides , the dicke hamiltonian for a finite @xmath0 provides a good description for the systems manipulated in the laboratory , especially in the light of the experimental realization of the superradiant phase transition in a bec @xcite , the intense development in the control of single atoms and photons in a cavity , and the possibility of a qpt in a system of @xmath0 qed circuits @xcite .",
    "the dicke model can be written as ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the field frequency , @xmath4 is the atomic energy separation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation photon operators , respectively , and @xmath7 is the coupling strength . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are collective atomic operators ( pseudospin operators ) which follow the su(2 ) algebra , and denote the atomic relative population and the atomic transitions operators , respectively .    for a finite number of atoms @xmath0 ,",
    "the model is in general non - integrable , and care must be taken when the first order in the @xmath10 expansion is employed because of its singular behavior around the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is integrable in at least two limits ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) . in the thermodynamic limit , when the number of atoms @xmath0 goes to infinity , the mean field description becomes exact .",
    "it provides analytic asymptotic solutions through a holstein - primakoff expansion @xcite , which allows to extract the critical exponents for the ground state energy per particle , the fraction of excited atoms , the number of photons per atom , their fluctuations and the concurrence @xcite .",
    "numerical solutions complement and confirm the theoretical predictions , and allow for the exploration of the system in regimes which are not described by the latter , like excited state phase transitions .    a concept emerging from quantum information theory",
    ", the fidelity , can be used to determine a sudden change in the ground state of a quantum system as a function of a control parameter . in recent years",
    "it has emerged as a powerful tool to study qpt in quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the fidelity describes the overlap between two quantum states . considering a quantum many - body system , the general form of the hamiltonian",
    "can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the interaction hamiltonian and @xmath7 is a control parameter .",
    "for two pure states @xmath15 and @xmath16 the fidelity is written as @xcite @xmath17 the fidelity measures the amount of shared information between two quantum states , being its geometric interpretation the closeness of these states .",
    "being a qpt a sudden change in the ground state properties of a system when a control parameter varies , a minimum in the fidelity allows to locate and characterize the qpt .",
    "its second derivative , the fidelity susceptibility , is even more sensitive to the qpt . expanding the fidelity around its minimum , for @xmath18 small , we have @xcite @xmath19 the fidelity susceptibility @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath21 being the first form in terms of the logarithmic fidelity .",
    "it is useful to choose @xmath22 in order to vary @xmath7 while taking the limit @xmath23 .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the fidelity goes to zero in the qpt , while the susceptibility goes to infinity . for finite systems , in the critical value of the coupling @xmath24 , the fidelity and its susceptibility show the _ precursor _ of the qpt by obtaining a minimum and a maximum value , respectively . calculating the behavior of these quantities ( the critical coupling parameter and the maximum value of the susceptibility ) allows us to derive their critical exponents as a function of the number of atoms @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can obtain universal curves for some observables like the fidelity @xcite or the susceptibility . for a finite scale analysis",
    ", we can define a universal quantity called the specific susceptibility @xcite , @xmath25 the specific susceptibility is useful to compare systems with different number of atoms .    in this work",
    "we calculate the fidelity and its susceptibility for the ground state of the finite dicke model , performing a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian . using the fidelity formalism",
    "we locate the precursor of the qpt for each @xmath0 . with it",
    ", we find numerically the critical exponent of the coupling parameter , which tends to @xmath26 , the critical value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also study the behavior of the minimum of the fidelity and the maximum of its susceptibility as @xmath0 grows , finding their critical exponents .",
    "we build the universal curve of the specific susceptibility , which confirms the value of the critical exponent .",
    "finally , we make a brief discussion of the ground state wave function precision as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "in order to solve numerically the dicke hamiltonian we employ extended bosonic coherent states @xcite .",
    "they are built with the displaced boson operators @xmath27 , obtained by shifting the original annihilation operator @xmath6 : @xmath28 the new basis is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an eigenvalue of the new number operator @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is an eigenvalue of @xmath34 .",
    "it allows for the determination of ground state properties in the superradiant region far beyond previous attempts @xcite , and also of excited states with a single truncation @xcite .    to solve the hamiltonian",
    "numerically we must truncate the hilbert space , which is infinite due to the presence of the number operator in the hamiltonian . in order to estimate the minimal truncation to be employed",
    ", we use a criterion based on the precision of the wave function , which we call the @xmath35 criterion @xcite .",
    "we express the ground state wave function as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the coefficients of the exact ground state wave function and @xmath38 is the value of the truncation in the number of displaced excitations .",
    "the probability @xmath39 of having @xmath30 excitations in the ground state is : @xmath40 we define the precision in the calculated wave function as ( see appendix ) @xmath41 by diagonalizing the hamiltonian with several truncations , if @xmath42 is smaller than certain tolerance we consider that the solution has converged , being @xmath38 the minimum value of the truncation necessary for obtaining the exact numerical solution .",
    "we calculate the fidelity and its susceptibility as functions of the coupling @xmath7 for the ground state by solving numerically the hamiltonian . in figures [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] we show the fidelity for several values of @xmath0 from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",

    "also , we can calculate the universal curve of the specific susceptibility for every value of @xmath0 .",
    "we show the curve in figure [ fig:8 ] .",
    "the universal curve guarantees that the critical exponent is correct , because the curves for all @xmath0 converge to one curve in the region around the critical value of the coupling strength @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath46 , @xmath75 . ]    finally , in figure [ fig:9 ] we show @xmath35 for the ground state as a function of the coupling for @xmath50 . as it can be observed , close to the phase transition precursor , which for this number of atoms takes place at @xmath76 , the numerical precision of the ground state wave function becomes smaller .",

    "@xmath56 . in this example",
    ", the @xmath76 and the value of the coupling where @xmath35 has its maximum is @xmath78 . ]",
    "we have calculated the fidelity and its susceptibility for the ground state of the finite dicke model , as functions of the coupling parameter strength , in resonance , for several values of the number of atoms .",
    "we located the phase transition for each value of @xmath0 using the fidelity formalism , and characterized the phase transition by calculating the critical exponents of the critical values of the coupling and the maximum values of the susceptibility , by fitting logarithmically the curves of both as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "the critical exponents are @xmath79 also , we fitted a quadratic curve of the logarithm of the fidelity as a function of the number of atoms .",
    "we validated the values found for the critical exponents plotting the universal curve of the specific susceptibility .",
    "finally , we exhibited that the precision of the ground state wave function ( which we use to determine the minimal truncation necessary to have the exact numerical solution ) have a maximum near the finite @xmath0 phase crossover .",
    "interestingly , those maxima occur at a coupling values slightly different from the ones obtained through the maximum of the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "this work was partially supported by conacyt - mxico and dgapa - unam project in102811 .",
    "in order to estimate the convergence in the wave function @xmath80 , we assume that a similar diagonalization was performed with a truncation @xmath81 , which provides @xmath82 . to compare both wave functions we extend the latter by assigning @xmath83",
    "we define the precision in the calculated wave function as : @xmath84    we assume that @xmath81 is large enough to allow the wave function to be close to convergence .",
    "it implies that adding to the hilbert space the states with @xmath38 photon excitations , the components @xmath85 will have small changes , conserving their respective phases ( but for a global one ) with their magnitude remaining constant or slightly decreasing to allow for non - zero @xmath86 new contributions .",
    "this condition can be expressed as    @xmath87    it follows that @xmath88 and @xmath89    we employ the equality to obtain an upper bound to the precision of the calculated wave functions .",
