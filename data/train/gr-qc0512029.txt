    "traversable lorentzian wormholes are solutions of the equations of gravitation which connect two regions of the same universe , or of two universes , by a throat @xcite .",
    "the throat is defined as a minimal area hypersurface which satisfies a flare - out condition @xcite .",
    "this requires the presence of exotic matter , that is , matter which violates the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite . because it has been shown that the amount of exotic matter necessary for the existence of a wormhole can be made infinitesimally small by a suitable choice of the geometry @xcite , considerable efforts have been addressed to precisely quantify such amount for different configurations , and to show how it can be minimized @xcite .",
    "indeed , the total amount of exotic matter has been pointed as an indicator of the physical viability of traversable wormholes @xcite .",
    "another central aspect of a wormhole in fact , of any physically meaningful solution within any theory of gravitation is its stability . within the framework of traversable wormholes ,",
    "stability under perturbations preserving the symmetry of the original configuration has been widely analyzed .",
    "in particular , this problem has received considerable attention in the case of thin - shell wormholes , that is , wormholes which are mathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds to obtain a geodesically complete new manifold @xcite . in this case",
    "the exotic matter is located in a shell placed at the joining surface ; the framework for dealing with these wormholes is the darmois ",
    "israel formalism , which leads to the lanczos equations , that is , to the equations of gravitation projected on the joining surface @xcite .",
    "the solution of these equations , once provided an equation of state for the matter on the shell , determines the dynamical evolution .",
    "such a procedure has been applied to spherically and cylindrically symmetric configurations associated to wormhole solutions within general relativity @xcite .",
    "the theory of gravity in five dimensions corresponding to the einstein ",
    "hilbert action supplemented with a gauss  bonnet term is , in a certain sense , the most general ( metric ) theory of gravity one can construct satisfying the conservation of the equations of motion which still remain being of second order @xcite .",
    "this theory , and its analogue in @xmath0 dimensions , was extensively studied in the last three decades and , in particular , the attention focused on it was mainly due to the fact that the theory arises within the string theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "for instance , a version of this appears as corrections ( proportional to the inverse of the string tension ) to the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory @xcite as well as in calabi ",
    "yau compactification of the @xmath1-theory @xcite .",
    "besides , these theories result closely related to chern  simons gravity in odd dimensions which turns out to correspond to a particular choice of the parameters of the model ; see ref . @xcite .",
    "physically , adding the gauss  bonnet ( higher order ) terms in the gravitational action corresponds to the inclusion of short distance corrections to general relativity .",
    "the study of black hole solutions in einstein  gauss  bonnet theory was initiated in the decade of 1980 , when the statical spherically symmetric solution was reported by boulware and deser in ref .",
    "subsequently , wiltshire derived in ref .",
    "@xcite the charged black hole geometry in both maxwell and born  infeld electrodynamics .",
    "both geometrical and thermodynamical aspects of black holes are substantially modified by the addition of the gauss  bonnet term @xcite .",
    "lorentzian wormholes in spacetimes with more than four dimensions were analyzed by several researchers @xcite .",
    "in particular , wormholes in einstein  gauss ",
    "bonnet gravity were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the idea is then to use lorentzian wormholes as a test bed to explore some of the qualitative changes that could happen in general relativity with the addition of a gauss - bonnet term .",
    "more precisely , we shall study how the stability under radial perturbations of five dimensional spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes in einstein  maxwell theory and the amount of exotic matter needed",
    "are affected by the presence of a gauss - bonnet term . in section 2",
    "we shall construct a generic thin - shell wormhole and write down the corresponding lanczos equations ; in section 3 we shall analyze its mechanical stability under perturbations preserving the symmetry , and in section 4 the energy conditions will be studied , and the total amount of exotic matter will be calculated . the dependence of the results in terms of the parameters of the model will be analyzed in detail .",
    "it will be shown that the inclusion of the gauss  bonnet term permits stability configurations with more physical values of @xmath2 with small charge ; also , we will see that the amount of exotic matter can be reduced for given values of the parameters .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a brief summary and discussion . throughout the paper we set units so that @xmath3 .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein  maxwell theory with a gauss  bonnet term representing a quadratic curvature correction is given by @xcite s = d^5xr-2-f_f^+r_r^-4r_r^+r^2 , where the signature chosen is @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath6 is a constant of dimensions @xmath7 .",

    "it is not difficult to check that in the limit @xmath12 the five dimensional einstein ",
    "maxwell solution with cosmological constant is recovered . in this limit , for @xmath13 the five dimensional reissner ",
    "nordstrm metric is obtained , so @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be identified with the mass and charge respectively . for @xmath16 , there is a minimum value of the radial coordinate @xmath17 such that the function inside the square root in eq .",
    "( [ metric2 ] ) is positive for @xmath18 , so the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) is well defined .",
    "the geometry has a curvature singularity at the surface defined by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters , this singular surface can be surrounded by an event horizon with radius @xmath20 , so the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) represents a black hole , or in absence of the event horizon , it is a naked singularity .",
    "we shall construct a spherically symmetric thin - shell wormhole starting from the generic geometry ( [ metric1 ] ) , and introduce the explicit form ( [ metric2 ] ) in the final results .",
    "we take two copies of the region @xmath21 , with @xmath22 greater than @xmath23 and @xmath17 to avoid possible horizons and singularities in our geometry , and paste them to obtain a geodesically complete new manifold with a matter shell at the surface @xmath24 , where the throat of the wormhole is located .",
    "the procedure follows the steps of the darmois - israel formalism ; in terms of the original coordinates @xmath25 , on the shell we define the coordinates @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the proper time .",

    ", we let the throat radius to vary with the proper time : @xmath34 . as a consequence of the generalized birkhoff theorem proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , the geometry will remain given by ( [ metric1 ] ) and ( [ metric2 ] ) for any @xmath35 greater than @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting expressions for the energy density and pressures for a generic metric function @xmath37 turn to be s_==-[sigma ] , s_=s_=s_=p=-+,[p ] where the overdot and the prime means , respectively , the derivatives with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath35 .",
    "as it was to be expected , the energy density is negative , revealing the existence of exotic matter at the shell .",
    "it is easy to see from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ p ] ) that the following conservation equation is fulfilled : a^3+pa^3=0.[cons ] for a static configuration of radius @xmath38 we simply have _ 0=- ,  p_0=-_0+.[eq ]",
    "note that as the wormhole radius approaches which would be the event horizon radius @xmath23 in the original metric , the energy density approaches to zero , but , instead , the pressure diverges unless @xmath39 ; this will be discussed in detail in section 4 .",
    "we shall study the stability of the configuration under small perturbations preserving the symmetry ; for this we shall follow the procedure first applied to thin - shell wormholes in ref .",
    "the dynamics of the shell results from the eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ p ] ) or , alternatively , from one of them and the conservation equation ( [ cons ] ) . in any case an equation of state for the matter on the shell must be provided ; because we are interested in studying small radial perturbations around a radius of equilibrium @xmath38 , we propose a linear relation p = p_0 + 2(-_0 ) , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy density and pressure corresponding to the equilibrium radius of the wormhole ; for ordinary matter @xmath2 would be the speed of sound , but due to the presence of exotic matter we shall regard it as an arbitrary constant .    these equations lead to an explicit relation between the energy density and the radius : ( a)=^3(2 + 1)+ .",
    "introducing this in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) we obtain the equation of motion a^2+v(a)=0 , where the potential @xmath42 is defined as v(a)=f(a)- a^2 ^ 2 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the potential fulfils @xmath43 so that the stable equilibrium configurations correspond to the condition @xmath44 .",
    "the second derivative of the potential for the generic metric ( [ metric1 ] ) is given by @xmath45 hence the stability of the configuration requires the relation 2>-[18a ] if @xmath46 , and 2<-[18b ] if @xmath47 .",
    "although it is possible to write explicitly an analytic expression of @xmath48 as a function of the parameters , the complexity of the formulas ( [ 18a ] ) and ( [ 18b ] ) inhibits to get a clear insight of the stability regions .",
    "it is thus preferable , as it is customary , to draw the curves @xmath49 , which allow for an intuitive understanding of the behavior of the configuration .",
    "we shall consider the cases @xmath13 and @xmath50 separately , and thoroughly discuss the dependence of the regions of stability with different choices of the parameters .     and",

    "thus , it is natural to perform an analysis for different cases depending on the relation existing between @xmath6 and the mass @xmath1 .    in the case of null cosmological",

    "this singularity is surrounded , in principle , by two horizons with radii r_=\\{--^2-^1/2}^1/2 .",
    "the event horizon is placed at @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the inner horizon . for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and",
    "the singularity can be shielded by the event horizon .",
    "but when @xmath76 , we have a naked singularity because @xmath77 . for @xmath78 , it is easy to see that there exists a critical value of the charge |q_c|=|-| , such that if @xmath79 there are two horizons , if @xmath80 there is only one ( degenerate ) horizon , and if @xmath81 there are no horizons . for @xmath82 ,",
    "no horizons exist for any value of the charge ( except the nonphysical solution @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , the wormhole radius @xmath38 is taken greater than @xmath23 to avoid the presence of event horizons in our wormhole geometries .",
    "note that when there is no horizon , the presence of the singular surface in @xmath19 compels us to consider values of @xmath38 greater than @xmath17 for the radius of the wormhole throat .",
    "the associated stability analysis reveals both analogies and remarkable differences with the general relativity case corresponding to @xmath12 : 1 ) two distinct regimes take place for @xmath78 and @xmath86 . in the first range",
    "most relevant results regarding the stability of the solutions appear , while in the second one stability requires @xmath87 ( figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) .",
    "2 ) for @xmath88 the critical value of charge , @xmath89 , is smaller than the value corresponding to general relativity ; instead for @xmath90 the critical charge is larger than in the absence of the gauss  bonnet terms . for @xmath91 ( five dimensional reissner ",
    "nordstrm metric ) the critical value of the charge is @xmath92 .",
    "3 ) as larger values of @xmath6 are considered , the regions of stability become enlarged ( including @xmath93 , which is an interesting feature ) without the necessity of large values of the charge ; in particular ( see upper left in fig .",
    "2 ) , this is possible with zero charge , which constitutes a drastic difference comparing with the general relativity case . besides , for @xmath94 we find a range of radii @xmath38 for which stability is achieved with any value of the parameter @xmath2 ( lower left in fig .",
    "4 ) for @xmath95 the regions of stability turn to be smaller than without the gauss  bonnet quadratic contribution ( see fig .",
    "the presence of the cosmological constant introduces a restriction on the admissible values for @xmath6 : it must be @xmath96 , in order to keep the metric real for large values of @xmath35 .",
    "now the singular surface radius @xmath17 is given by the greatest real and positive solution of the equation 1+r^6+r^2-=0 , [ rmin1 ] or @xmath71 if all real solutions are non positive .",
    "the addition of the cosmological constant makes more complicated the structure of the horizons in the original manifold .",
    "indeed we now have that the horizons are real and non - negative solutions of the equation r^6 - 6r^4 + 12-r^2 - 2q^2=0,[cubic ] subject to the constraints @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for @xmath99",

    "as it was previously said the value of @xmath38 is taken greater than @xmath17 and @xmath23 .",
    "the critical value of charge for fixed @xmath6 is an increasing function of @xmath5 , then for @xmath103 its value is smaller than for @xmath13 . for small values of @xmath104 , which are the most interesting ones from a physical point of view",
    ", a numerical calculation shows that the stability regions slightly change compared with the case @xmath13 .",
    "for the sake of brevity , the plots are not included .",
    "the case @xmath105 is considerably different from the point of view of the character of the horizons in the original manifold : for @xmath105 a cosmological horizon exists .",
    "therefore the shell should always be placed inside the cosmological horizon .",
    "the positions of the singular surface and the horizons are obtained again from eqs .",
    "( [ rmin1 ] ) and ( [ cubic ] ) respectively . when @xmath106 we have that @xmath77 for @xmath107 , so there is a naked singularity . with other combinations of the parameters it is @xmath108 , if @xmath23 exists . for @xmath109 , besides the cosmological horizon , there are two , one or zero additional horizons for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , with the critical value of charge again given by eq .",

    "as in the preceding case , @xmath89 increases with @xmath5 , so that the critical value in de sitter case is greater than for @xmath13 .",
    "now there is a change in the values of @xmath112 for which the largest regions of stability are found , namely @xmath109 .",
    "however , the stability analysis for small @xmath5 does not reveal any remarkable aspect differing from the case @xmath13 , except that the stability region corresponding to @xmath87 becomes limited for large values of the wormhole radius due to the presence of the cosmological horizon .",
    "again , for the same reason as in the anti - de sitter case , the plots are omitted .",
    "quantifying the amount of exotic matter has been considered as a way to characterize the viability of traversable wormholes @xcite . here",
    "we shall analyze the energy conditions and evaluate the total amount of exotic matter for the wormholes constructed in section 2 , in the case of static configurations , i.e. for @xmath113 .",
    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) states that for any timelike vector @xmath114 it must be @xmath115 ; the wec also implies , by continuity , the null energy condition ( nec ) , i.e. that for any null vector @xmath116 it must be @xmath117 @xcite . in an orthonormal basis",
    "the wec reads @xmath118 , while the nec takes the form @xmath119 . in the case of the wormhole",
    "constructed above with radial pressure @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 , so that both energy conditions are violated .",
    "the transverse pressure is @xmath122 and the sign of @xmath123 , instead , is not fixed , but depends on the values of the parameters .",
    "there have been several proposals for quantifying the amount of exotic matter in the wormhole ; two of them are the integrals @xcite d^4x ,   ( + p_i ) d^4x , where @xmath124 is the determinant of the metric tensor . the most usual choice is the integral including the pressure associated to the violation of the energy conditions : = ( + p_r ) d^4x . in our case , introducing the new coordinate @xmath125 with @xmath126 corresponding to each side of the shell , we have = _ 0 ^ 2_0^_0^ _ -^(+p_r ) drd d d. because the shell does not exert radial pressure , and the energy density is located on a surface , so that @xmath127 , then we simply have = _ 0 ^ 2_0^_0^ .",

    "thus we find that = -3a_0 ^ 2 .",
    "replacing the explicit form of the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) , simple expressions for the behavior of @xmath128 with the wormhole radius can be obtained for the limiting case @xmath129 , which makes sense only for @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "for @xmath132 we have -3a_0 ^ 2 . for @xmath133",

    "the horizon radius depends on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "note the difference in the scales in the energy axis between the two graphics.,width=604 ]    a natural question is which are the conditions such that the amount of exotic matter can be reduced . because @xmath128 is proportional to @xmath40 , which , as anticipated in section 2 , approaches to zero when the wormhole radius tends to the event horizon of the original metric",
    ", we shall analyze this limit in detail .",
    "we consider values of @xmath6 for which horizons effectively exist ; the number of horizons in the original manifold is in this case determined by the value of the charge .",
    "when @xmath141 is less that the critical value of charge @xmath89 defined in section 3 , there are two horizons ( within this analysis we are not interested in the cosmological horizon which appears in the case @xmath142 , which is always much greater than the others for small @xmath5 ) . in this case @xmath143 and @xmath144 . for @xmath38 near the event horizon radius @xmath23 , we have _ 0=-+o(a_0-r_h)^3/2 , p_0=+o(a_0-r_h)^1/2 , so that as @xmath38 approaches @xmath23 the total amount of exotic matter @xmath128 tends to vanish , but the pressure takes unlimitedly large values . instead , when @xmath80 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , we have _",
    "0=-(a_0-r_h)+o(a_0-r_h)^2 , p_0=+o(a_0-r_h ) , so that the amount of exotic matter @xmath128 can be made as small as desired , keeping the pressure finite , by taking @xmath38 near @xmath23 .",
    "one can also verify that if @xmath81 then the original metric includes no horizons , and the amount of exotic matter has a minimum for @xmath38 slightly greater than @xmath17 , while the pressure for this @xmath38 remains finite .    in figs .",
    "[ en ] we have plotted the total amount of exotic matter for different choices of the parameters ( always with @xmath147 and @xmath13 ) , in the case @xmath148 , so that at least one horizon exists . in each figure , when @xmath6 changes we keep fixed the relation between the wormhole radius and the horizon ; the range of possible values of charge is reduced as @xmath6 increases .",
    "we can see that : 1 ) for a given value of @xmath6 and a fixed radius of the wormhole , the total amount of exotic matter decreases as the charge is made larger ; 2 ) for a given charge , the amount of exotic matter is reduced by increasing the value of @xmath6 ; 3 ) the exotic matter present is reduced by placing the wormhole throat nearer the horizon .",
    "we have studied five dimensional spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes in einstein  maxwell theory with the addition of a gauss  bonnet term .",
    "we have analyzed the mechanical stability under perturbations preserving the symmetry , and evaluated the total amount of exotic matter and related its behavior with that of the pressure of the shell , as a function of the parameters of the model and of the theory .",
    "for null @xmath6 our paper extends to five dimensions the analysis made in previous works @xcite in four dimensional gravity .",
    "but when @xmath149 new interesting results are obtained .",
    "we have found that the inclusion of the quadratic correction ( gauss  bonnet term ) allows for much more freedom in the choice of the configurations to render them stable .",
    "in particular , a central positive feature of the inclusion of the quadratic correction is that , differing from the general relativity case ( @xmath150 ) , considerably larger regions of stability appear , even for vanishing charge ; in this sense , we should emphasize that values of the parameter @xmath2 positive and smaller than unity are now possible , while in the case @xmath150 this could be achieved only with the aid of large values of charge ( @xmath15 close to @xmath151 ) .",
    "regarding the amount of exotic matter @xmath128 and pressure , the analysis shows that , in the case that an event horizon exists in the original manifold from which we started our thin - shell construction , @xmath128 can be minimized by choosing a wormhole radius near the event horizon . in general this",
    "is correlated with an unlimited increase of the pressure , except if the parameters are chosen so that the inner and outer horizons coincide : in this case the exotic energy can be reduced as desired , keeping the pressure finite .",
    "besides , we have shown that as the gauss  bonnet term is made more relevant by increasing the parameter @xmath6 , the amount of exotic matter results to be substantially reduced .",
