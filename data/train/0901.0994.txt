    "many fundamental issues of a first year laboratory course are at stake when we use the simple pendulum @xcite experiment to measure _ g_. undergraduate texts explains the _ theory _ of an idealized scheme with a point mass attached to an ideal thread oscillating with very small amplitudes to justify the mathematical approximation used in the deduction : see fig .",
    "[ pendoli1 ] scheme ( a ) . in _ practice _ , a point mass does not exist , neither does an ideal thread , nor do infinitely small oscillations .",
    "hence the problem of the passage from an idealized physical system to a real one @xcite must be discussed with students and the limits of a mathematical approximation must be assessed .",
    "therefore in the laboratory we start the trial experiment by carefully engineering a systematic error in the first rough measures of _ g _ to emphasize the important difference between theory , which considers a point mass , and the laboratory experiment , which uses an extended body .",
    "after that we compare the parameters of two distinct normal distributions by asking students to measure fifty times , say , five and subsequently ten complete oscillations .",
    "the data form two gaussian distributions with compatible means but different dispersions .",
    "the analysis of these data require : ( i ) identification of a gaussian distribution , ( ii ) comparison of gaussian mean using the central limit theorem , and ( iii ) comparison of standard deviations . in the final part of the experiment students observe damping oscillations and check their mathematical model . here",
    "they have to use their judgment to measure the time constant with two different methods and check the compatibility of the results obtained .    in the wider outline of a first laboratory course based on oscillations and waves , this experiment",
    "is followed by a second set of two four - hour laboratory sessions with a mass - spring experiment . in this new context students practice : ( a ) the passage from idealized theory to real laboratory conditions , in this case from a theoretical zero - mass spring to a spring with a relevant mass @xcite ; ( b ) a straight - line fit ; ( c ) observing damping and determining the more demanding resonance curve and its fwhm .",
    "introductory lectures present an explanation of theory and an outline of the experiment . through discussions",
    "we define the variables to be measured , present suitable techniques and procedures , indicate some common errors , and give general advice .",
    "we ask students to write a rough plan of the experiment in advance . in the laboratory students",
    "assemble the apparatus and follow their own plan .",
    "assistance is given in terms of discussions and help to slower groups so that most of them proceed together through the various phases of the experiment .",
    "we interrupt the work at critical points to ask students to record on the board a summary of data from their lab notebooks for general statistical treatment and plenary discussion .",
    "in the introductory lecture we start by discussing how to measure _",
    "g _ in our laboratory .",
    "we first ask which is the most convenient physical law for that purpose , from the point of view of ease and precision .",
    "we are at the beginning of a physics course , so we compare the advantages and disadvantages of the law of free fall and the pendulum @xcite . in the end of the discussion",
    "it is agreed that the law describing the period of a simple pendulum @xcite    @xmath0    is the most convenient . + we guide the next decision to prepare the ground for the comparison between two different normal distributions .",
    "we ask students to make two sets of measurements of the period .",
    "they measure fifty times the time required for five complete oscillations and then repeat the procedure for ten periods . here",
    "they practice comparing distributions with compatible means but different dispersions .    since the thread length @xmath1 and the period _",
    "t _ can be measured with a precision of a few parts per thousand , it will be possible to detect the effects of very small systematic errors caused by thread rigidity @xcite + and the choice of initial conditions .",
    "the first practical decision regards the length of thread to be used . after considering many possible values ,",
    "we decide to choose the same length for all groups for statistical reasons , say , 500 _ mm _ , on the grounds of not only minimizing relative errors but also having periods of oscillation that are not too long .",
    "students are then asked to make a trial experiment to test the apparatus by measuring period _ t _ three times using each time five complete oscillations . the corresponding calculated value for _ g _ has to fall within a few percentage points of its expected value .",
    "in this initial phase they check that the apparatus is working properly , practice observing and timing techniques , and on completion copy a summary of data and results on the board , such as shown in the following table , for a brief plenary discussion .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the curve @xmath2 is transformed into the straight line @xmath3 we discuss with students that it is advisable to organize an experiment with two different methods of measuring a quantity ( in order to study the compatibility of the results , and to check for possible systematic errors ) , and this is especially advisable in our case , in which a value is strongly dependent on the observer s judgment .",
    "it was also noticed that the five points show a slowly decreasing local slope indicating that the damping time increases as the oscillation amplitude decreases .",
    "the slope of this line ( the inverse of the damping time ) is compared with the value obtained by direct measurement .",
    "this experimental observation indicates that the friction ( responsible for the damping ) increases with velocity .",
    "the unexpected success of this session ( good compatibility between the data obtained with different experimental paths ) rewards students after their hard work .",
    "data gathered over the years clearly shows higher losses with the relatively rigid fishing lines ( confirming the shift of the pole ) , with bobs oscillating outside the original oscillation plane or with larger oscillation amplitudes .",
    "given their importance in physics , we have chosen oscillations and waves as the main theme of our laboratory course .",
    "after the pendulum , students tackle the mass - spring experiment to revise previous data treatment techniques and to practice the new ones presented in the lectures .",
    "the layout scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ schema - massamolla ]    we start with the ideal ( undamped ) motion equation @xmath4 this equation assumes a zero - mass spring , which of course can not exist in a laboratory .",
    "students measure the spring constant _ k _ using both hooke s law and angular speed @xmath5 measurements according to @xmath6    comparison of both graphs ( [ hook+omega ] ) clearly shows a discrepancy between the two values of _ k_. to get round of this discrepancy students have to analyze the motion equations in detail .",
    "they conclude that theory does not take into consideration the mass of the spring .",
    "+ then , as in the previous experiment , the damping time is measured .",
    "this result is cross - checked with the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the resonance curve .",
    "the equation describing the complete motion is treated theoretically in conjunction with the motion of forced oscillations .",
    "+ the resonance curve measurements require a substantial upgrade of the experimental apparatus to cause and to detect the oscillations .",
    "students practice on line data acquisition and gather values for the resonance curve .",
    "the last part of this rather complex and demanding experiment is the measurement of the phase curve as a function of the frequency of the applied force @xcite .",
    "all measurements and their statistical treatment ( gaussian distribution , compatibility of mean values and of standard deviations , curve fitting and confidence level ) come out as expected from theory . the technique involved in the experiments is very simple but not trivial .",
    "the content in terms of physics is dense because we have to treat the relation between theory and experiment , the weight of approximations , the kind of thread used , and finally the losses dependent on thread rigidity , bob speed and oscillation path .",
    "the content in terms of data processing is equally dense because we have to deal with arithmetic and weighted means , comparison of standard deviations , gaussian distributions of errors , internal compatibility between data and expected results , cross - checking of measurements subject to judgment , test of an exponential decay by means of a straight line fit .",
    "+ measuring the gravitational acceleration with the pendulum can be rewarding when the expected result of an important physical quantity is obtained after hours of hard work . mere solitary data collection can discourage first year students , therefore plenary discussions and subsequent achievement of compatible results in difficult experimental assets can help to reward students , some of which are facing practicals for the first time . following the pendulum experiment with a free and then forced oscillation of a mass - spring experiment gives a practical grounding of shm theory with a single degree of freedom . by choosing oscillations and waves as a theme for our first year lab course , we provide students with a coherent context in which to practice basic techniques , use of new instruments , and experimental data treatment .",
    "the general motion of a simple pendulum is a composed of the center of mass oscillation and of an oscillatory rotation of the disk around its center of mass .",
    "the system energy has two kinetic components @xmath7 thus the total kinetic energy is @xmath8 in the kinetic energy formula the length of the pendulum with extended mass is the distance from the pole to the center of mass .",
    "since the two angular velocities are equal @xmath9 @xmath10        50 many topics of interest about the pendulum can be found in : michael e. matthews , colin f. gauld , arthur stinner ( eds . ) , _ the pendulum .",
