    "atom diffraction by light has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite and these early works have been followed by many studies too numerous to be quoted here .",
    "the phases of the diffraction amplitudes are rarely discussed in detail , with a few exceptions like the works of s. chu and coworkers @xcite and of k. burnett and coworkers @xcite , in both cases for raman adiabatic transfer , and the work of c. bord and coworkers @xcite , which analyzes the general diffraction process in the rotating wave approximation .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation can not be used for elastic diffraction studied here .    in an interferometer ,",
    "the diffraction phases modify the interference signals but this effect is difficult to detect , as it requires accurate phase measurements and it cancels in symmetric interferometers , like the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present an analytic calculation of diffraction phases in a simple case ( elastic diffraction by a laser standing wave ) and to show the importance of these diffraction phases in an existing experiment .",
    "we consider here diffraction in the raman - nath regime and second order bragg diffraction in the weak field regime and we apply these results to the contrast interferometer built by the group of d. pritchard @xcite .",
    "the calculated diffraction phases are large in this interferometer and as these phases depend rapidly on the laser power density used for the diffraction process , our calculation may explain the observed phase noise as resulting from fluctuations of this power density .",

    "figure  [ bloch energies ] presents the energy of the lowest bloch states as a function of @xmath23 for two values of the potential , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with two important features : when @xmath19 is not equal to zero , band gaps appear at each crossing of the @xmath26 folded parabola and energy shifts appear at the same time .",
    "these energy shifts are explained by perturbation theory : each free plane wave @xmath28 is coupled to two other states , @xmath29 and the two coupling terms are equal . as the energy denominator is larger for the coupling to the upper state , all the levels",
    "are pushed upwards ( except near the places where gaps open ) , but the lowest bloch state is obviously pushed downwards .",

    "in order to simplify the calculations , we consider that the atom is initially in a state of zero momentum , @xmath32 . we first consider diffraction in the raman - nath regime .",
    "this approximation consists in neglecting the dynamics of the atom during the diffraction process produced by a pulse @xmath33 of duration @xmath34 .",

    "the validity range of this approximation is given by @xcite : @xmath37 and the diffracted wave is a classic result : @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we have verified @xcite that the raman - nath formula predicts accurately the diffraction probability of order @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for finite values of the parameter @xmath19 , as long as condition ( [ rn1 ] ) is verified , but we have not tested the phases of these diffraction amplitudes .",
    "they could be tested by using the diffraction amplitudes calculated @xcite as a power series of @xmath42 .",

    "the dynamics is adiabatic if the potential @xmath33 varies slowly , but diffraction remains possible when two free states are degenerate , as the @xmath43 states .",

    "the opposite signs of the diffraction phases are a consequence of the opposite signs of the energy shifts of these levels . in the resulting phase difference",

    "we now calculate the output signal of the contrast interferometer developed by s. gupta et al .",
    "this interferometer uses second order bragg diffraction and raman - nath diffraction and the atomic paths are represented in figure  [ interferometer ] .",
    "the initial state is a bose einstein condensate , approximated here by a @xmath76 state . a first intense and brief pulse from @xmath77 till @xmath34 is used to diffract this initial state in three coherent states , @xmath44 , @xmath43 . within the raman - nath approximation , the wavefunction for @xmath34 is given by : @xmath78\\ ] ] the argument @xmath79 of bessel functions being omitted for compactness .",
    "the best contrast @xcite would be obtained with diffraction probabilities equal to @xmath80 for the @xmath44 state and @xmath81 for each of the @xmath82 states .",

    "we assume that @xmath34 is negligible so that free propagation starts at @xmath77 and lasts till the bragg diffraction pulse which extends from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . using equation ( [ pr9 ] ) ,",
    "we get the wavefunction after this pulse : @xmath87\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] free propagation goes on till a time @xmath14 where the matter grating formed by the interference of these three states is read by the reflection of a laser beam . the atomic density as a function of @xmath88 and @xmath14",
    "is deduced from the wavefunction :    @xmath89    the experimental signal @xmath90 is the intensity of the light reflected by this grating .",
    "this homodyne detection signal is proportional to the square of the @xmath91 modulation of the atomic density , with the following time - dependence : @xmath92 while the equation used by gupta et al .",
    "is : @xmath93 the difference between equation ( [ ci4 ] ) and ( [ ci5 ] ) will be important only if one wants to make an absolute prediction of the phase , but it has no consequence in the analysis carried by s. gupta et al .",
    "@xcite , because their fitted value of @xmath94 comes from the derivative of the phase with the time interval @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "however , our result remains interesting as it may explain a large part of the observed phase noise , @xmath96 mrad from shot to shot . in the @xmath97 phase of equation ( [ ci4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath73 are proportional to the rabi phase , which is itself proportionnal to @xmath53 i.e. to the square of the laser power density during the bragg pulse .",
    "therefore , a @xmath41% variation of the laser power density changes the diffraction phase by @xmath98 mrad .     in the @xmath8 , @xmath99 plane ,",
    "we have represented the atomic paths followed by the wavepackets in the interferometer of gupta et al . [ 13 ] : raman - nath diffraction at time @xmath100 , second order bragg diffraction at time @xmath101 , detection near time @xmath102 .",

    "assuming @xmath107 , we get @xmath108 and the validity condition ( [ rn1 ] ) requires @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the corrections to the raman - nath phases are not fully negligible .",
    "we have also neglected the second order diffraction beams , which contribute to the signal .",

    "higher order terms in @xmath115 with @xmath116 contribute to the phases and the sensitivity of the diffraction phase to the laser power density may even be larger than predicted above .    obviously , to describe very accurately this experiment , a full numerical modelization is needed and feasible , as the problem reduces to a @xmath117 schrdinger equation , if atom - atom interactions are neglected .",
    "but , as noted by gupta et al . , the mean field effect of the condensate can also modify atomic propagation and this effect has not been not considered here .",
    "in this paper , we have made a simple and tutorial calculation of the phase shifts of atomic waves due to elastic diffraction process by a laser standing wave .",
    "we have calculated the associated phase shift for the contrast interferometer of d. pritchard et al .",
    "@xcite , thus showing that it should be possible to make an experimental test of the dependence of the diffraction phase shifts with potential strength and interaction time .",
    "the present calculations are simple because of our assumptions : raman - nath limit or perturbative regime , vanishing initial momentum @xmath118 .",
    "an accurate modelization of a real experiment requires numerical integration of schrdinger equation to describe the diffraction dynamics without any approximation .",
    "we have considered only first and second order diffraction .",
    "higher diffraction orders up to order @xmath119 , have been observed @xcite with moderate laser power densities .",
    "the leading term of the coupling matrix element responsible for diffraction order @xmath120 behaves like @xmath115 @xcite whereas the leading terms of the energy shifts , responsible for the diffraction phase shifts , are always in @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , for diffraction orders @xmath121 , the control of the phase shifts will require a full knowledge of the pulse shape .",
    "for the second order of diffraction , the diffraction phase shifts and the rabi phase are simply related , as long as second order perturbation theory is a good approximation .",
    "we have made a systematic use of atomic bloch states to describe atom diffraction by laser , following our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the introduction of bloch states to describe atoms in a laser standing waves is due to letokhov and minogin @xcite in 1978 and also to castin and dalibard @xcite in 1991 .",
    "their use is rapidly expanding , in particular to treat bose - einstein condensates in an optical lattice , as reviewed by rolston and phillips @xcite .",
    "when coupled to reduced units as done here , the atomic bloch states represent a very efficient tool to get a simple understanding of the diffraction process .",
