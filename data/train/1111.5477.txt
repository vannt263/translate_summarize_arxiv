    "a large amount of theoretical and experimental research has been dedicated to one - dimensional magnetic systems [ 1 ] .",
    "models corresponding to real quasi - one - dimensional magnets are broadly investigated as first they were considered as somewhat simpler than the really interesting three - dimensional systems but then turned out to be interesting in their own right .",
    "there was the availability of rear magnetic compounds which because of extremely small coupling between neighboring chains , could be considered as reasonable realizations of magnetically one - dimensional materials .",
    "soliton solutions for classical sine - gordon chains [ 2 ] and heisenberg chains with various anisotropies [ 3 - 6 ] were obtained and analyzed . in recent years",
    "there is a renewed interest to the topic due to their application .",
    "spin - wave dark solitons were predicted and experimentally generated [ 7,8 ] .",
    "solitons in magnetic thin films [ 9 ] and in ferromagnets with biquadratic exchange [ 10 ] were investigated .",
    "bright and dark solitons as exact solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation have been studied intensively [ 3,4,11 ] .",
    "but , the models describing the physical effects in solids are mainly discrete and the question arises how the discreteness modify the properties of the nonlinear excitations [ 12,13 ] .",
    "another interesting topic of research with practical importance is the interaction of solitons with impurities [ 14 - 18 ] .",
    "the influence of the interaction with second - neighbors [ 19 ] and third - neighbors [ 20 ] on the bright soliton dynamics has been also considered .    in the present paper",
    "we study the condition for the appearance of dark solitons in an anisotropic ferromagnetic chain with first- and second - neighbor interactions .",
    "the propagation for arbitrary wave number is considered and the scattering on point defects is investigated .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic heisenberg chain of @xmath0 spins with magnitude @xmath1 described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 where both nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions are taken into account .",
    "the spin operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 obey the commutation relations @xmath5=\\mp s_{i}^{\\pm } \\delta_{ij},\\quad [ s_{i}^{+},s_{j}^{-}]=2s_{i}^{z } \\delta_{ij}\\ , .\\ ] ] @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 are the exchange integrals and @xmath9 is the on - site anisotropy constant which can be positive ( easy axis ) or negative ( easy plane ) . if @xmath10 the inter - site anisotropy is included .",

    "( 4 ) turns to the discrete ablowitz - ladik equation which is also completely integrable and has soliton solutions .",
    "so , for narrow excitations it is necessary to investigate the whole set ( 4 ) .",
    "equations similar to ( 4 ) has been derived for exciton solitons in molecular crystals [ 21 ] .",
    "we shall look for solutions in the form of amplitude - modulated waves @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the wave number and the frequency of the carrier wave ( the lattice constant equals unity ) and the envelope @xmath25 is a slowly varying function of the position and time . in the continuum limit , when the soliton width is much larger than the lattice spacing ( @xmath26 ) , equation ( 4 ) transforms into the following nls equation for the envelope :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 @xmath29 is the group velocity and @xmath30 describes the group - velocity dispersion of the carrier waves . depending on the sign of the expression @xmath31 equation ( 6 ) possesses soliton solutions of different types . for negative values bright solitons exist while for positive values dark solitons are possible .",
    "let us consider the dependence of the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath32 on @xmath23 ( fig .  1 and 2 ) . the group - velocity dispersion @xmath30 depends only on @xmath33 and @xmath34 and is not influenced by the anisotropy of the system . without second neighbor interaction ( @xmath35 ) @xmath30 changes sign at the middle ( @xmath36 ) of the brillouin zone .",

    "strong second - neighbor interactions ( @xmath38 ) lead to a second point where the function @xmath30 changes again sign ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) @xmath32 is negative in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "so in this case equation ( 6 ) has bright - soliton solutions for @xmath41 and dark - soliton solutions exist for @xmath42 .",
    "the inclusion of positive on - site anisotropy ( @xmath43 ) preserves this behavior .",
    "the inclusion of negative on - site anisotropy ( @xmath44 ) leads to the appearance of a wave number @xmath45 so that @xmath32 is positive for @xmath46 and negative for @xmath47 [ ( fig .",
    "then the brillouin zone is divided in three regions where the solution alters from dark- to bright- and again to dark - soliton . if @xmath48 then the solution of equation ( 6 ) is of the dark - soliton type in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the inclusion of weak second - neighbor interactions has influence only on the value of @xmath45 and the size of the regions where the different solutions exist .",
    "strong second - neighbor interactions with @xmath38 will lead to the appearance of the additional region near the band edge @xmath49 where the function @xmath30 becomes positive ( fig .  1 ) and",

    "2(b ) shows the function @xmath32 for the case of inter - site anisotropy ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "when the second - neighbor interactions are not taken into account the solution of equation ( 6 ) is of the dark - soliton type in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the inclusion of second - neighbor interactions will lead again to three or four ( if @xmath38 ) regions where different soliton solutions exist .    in what follows",

    "then @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath56 are given by the relations :    @xmath62    the dark soliton can be considered as an excitation of the background ( carrier ) wave .",
    "its velocity consists of the group velocity @xmath29 and a contribution @xmath63 which depends on @xmath57 . for fixed ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath23 solitons moving faster have smaller amplitude @xmath60 .    the bright soliton solution which exists for @xmath65 and @xmath66 at @xmath53 has the form @xmath67 with @xmath68    we like to make some remarks about the influence of the next - nearest - neighbor interaction on the form and velocity of the soliton solution .",

    "the group velocity @xmath29 is defined in the whole brillouin zone and coincides with the velocity of the bright solitons and of the dark solitons for @xmath69 [ fig .",
    "it is independent of the anisotropy of the model .",
    "the small second neighbor interactions change only the value of the velocity , while strong second neighbor interactions ( @xmath38 ) can change also its sign .",
    "the velocity of the dark soliton itself @xmath63 is shown on fig .",
    "it is nonequal zero in the regions where the dark solitons exist and its sign is determined by @xmath57 as given in ( 10 ) .",
    "we performed numerical simulations based on the general discrete equation ( 4 ) and we investigate mainly the dark soliton solution .",
    "as initial function we put for @xmath70 the form @xmath71 which is exact solution of the quasicontinuum equation , and observe the evolution for different anisotropic cases . for wide solitons ( @xmath26 )",
    "this solution remain stable and its form and velocity are preserved .",
    "when the soliton width decreases the discreteness effects of equation ( 4 ) become important and the parameters of the dark soliton change .    in",
    "what follows we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "4 shows the propagation of the dark solitons in the case @xmath74 for two @xmath23-values ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "when the second neighbor interaction is absent ( @xmath35 ) the solitons propagate with the same velocity and amplitude [ fig .",
    "4(a),(a@xmath77 ) ] .",
    "when the second neighbor interactions are present the solitons have different amplitudes and velocities [ fig .",
    "4(b),(b@xmath77 ) for @xmath78 . as can be seen from the @xmath23-dependence of the velocity from fig .",
    "3 the value of the velocity for the greater @xmath23 is smaller .",
    "the increase of the second neighbor interaction leads to the turning of the solution for @xmath79 to a bright soliton type [ fig .",

    "similar results have been obtained for the case with on - site anisotropy @xmath39 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",

    "so the results on fig .",
    "4(b),(c ) can be obtained also for @xmath79 provided @xmath34 has the values -0.1 and -0.3 , respectively .",
    "we studied the interaction of the dark solitons with impurities in the chain whose size is small compared to the soliton extent .",

    "we investigate the interaction of a propagating dark soliton of the form ( 13 ) with a defect placed at the middle of the chain @xmath91 .",
    "we have observed that in the case of attraction the solitons pass through the defect for arbitrary initial velocity .",
    "more interesting is the interaction with repulsive impurities .    in the case of repulsion",
    "the soliton can be transmitted or reflected by the impurity . for a given initial velocity @xmath92",
    "there is a critical value of the defect @xmath93 below which the soliton is transmitted and above which it is reflected .",
    "we consider dark solitons which velocities are determined only by @xmath23 ( @xmath69 ) .",
