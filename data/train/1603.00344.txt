    "the formation and evolution of the milky way ( mw ) halo has been the subject of several investigations in the past years , and a great deal of observational work has been done in order to obtain more and more precise abundance determinations in stars in the galaxy and local group galaxies .",
    "we recall here a number of on - going and planned spectroscopic mw survey , such as rave ( steinmetz et al .",
    "2006 ) , segue ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , apogee ( majewski et al . 2010 ) , hermes ( freeman 2010 ) , gaia - eso ( gilmore et al . 2012 ) .",
    "a crucial information regarding the dominant mechanisms responsible for the formation of the mw halo is encoded in the chemical and kinematical properties of its member stars .",
    "in particular , the study of the mw stellar halo provides several clues about the earliest phases of the galaxy evolution , since the halo is the easiest place where to find the most metal - poor and oldest stars currently known in the universe although very old stars could be found also in the bulge of the mw ( white & springel 2000 ) .    the current cosmological @xmath4 cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) paradigm envisages the assemblage of large structures in the universe as starting from the coalescence of smaller ones , via cooling and condensation of gas in always larger dark matter halos ( press & schechter 1974 ; white & rees 1978 ; springel , frenk & white 2006 ) . according to the @xmath4cdm model , a mw - like galaxy must have formed by the coalescence of a large number of smaller systems which",
    ", even today , might be still in the process of being accreted .",
    "in particular , dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) were proposed in the past as the best candidate small progenitor systems , which merged through cosmic time to eventually form the stellar halo component of the galaxy ( e.g. grebel 2005 ) .",
    "the mw dsph satellites have been soon recognized among the faintest and most dark matter dominated stellar systems ever observed in the universe , before the discovery of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the role played by dsphs in shaping the halo of the mw still remains controversial .",
    "major issues are the still relatively small number of discovered galaxy satellites ( the so - called missing satellite problem , e.g. bullock 2010 , klypin et al . 1999 , and moore et al . 1999 ) and the different chemical abundance patterns in halo and dsph stars ( shetrone et al . 2001 , venn et al . 2004 , vincenzo et al . 2014 ) .    in order to test the capability of the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario to explain the mw halo metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , prantzos ( 2008 ) presented the results of an approximated analytical model , where the galaxy stellar halo was assumed to assemble by means of successive merger events of small sub - halos with similar physical properties as current dsphs .",
    "although the treatment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) chemical evolution was very simple , prantzos ( 2008 ) claimed to reproduce the galaxy halo mdf , since his results rely on the stellar mass distribution function of the merging sub - halo population , which the current hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm can predict with very high accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , prantzos ( 2008 ) did not discuss any implication on the [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] abundance pattern , which is one of the main issues which hierarchical picture has to deal with , since the abundance patterns of surviving local group galaxies do not match those of the stars in the stellar halo .",
    "it is worth reminding that unavane et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and jofre & weiss ( 2011 ) used the age distributions of stars in the halo and dsphs to test the origin of halo stars .",
    "interestingly , by making use of a chemical evolution model within a cosmological framework , font et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that the discrepancy in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios can be solved if the majority of the mw halo formed by accreting sub - halos with mass in the range 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6m@xmath7 , which had been disrupted very early ( @xmath2 8 - 9 gyr ago ) .    on the other hand , fiorentino et al .",
    "( 2015 ) using rr lyrae stars as tracers of the galactic halo ancient stellar component , showed that dsphs do not appear to be the major building - blocks of the halo .",
    "leading physical arguments suggest an extreme upper limit of 50% to their contribution .    in recent years ,",
    "willman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and belokurov et al ( 2006a , b , 2007 ) using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) were able to discover an entirely new population of hitherto unknown stellar systems : the so - called ultra faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( ufds ) , which are characterized by extremely low luminosities , high dark matter content , and very old and iron - poor stellar populations ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006a ; norris et al ( 2008 , 2010 ) ; brown et al 2012 ) .",
    "furthermore , ufd systems are observed to be completely gas - free at the present time .",
    "the number of ufds has increased constantly in the last decade and completeness estimates suggest that many more of these faint satellites are still to be discovered in the local group ( tollerud et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this fact might place them as the survived building blocks of the galaxy stellar halo , dramatically lacking in the past .",
    "the main aims of this work can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   we test the hypothesis that dsph and ufd galaxies have been the building blocks of the galactic halo , by assuming that the halo formed by accretion of stars belonging to these galaxies . 2 .",
    "we explore the scenario , in which the galactic halo formed by accretion of chemically enriched gas originating from dsph and ufd galaxies .    in spitoni ( 2015 ) , using the formalism described by matteucci ( 2001 ) , recchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and spitoni et al .",
    "( 2010 ) it was shown , for the first time , an analytical solution for the evolution of the metallicity of a galaxy in presence of `` environment '' effects . in this work a galaxy suffers , during its evolution , the infall of enriched gas from another evolving galactic system , with this gas having chemical abundances variable in time .    in this work",
    "we extend the results of spitoni ( 2015 ) to detailed chemical evolution models in which the instantaneous recycling approximation ( ira ) is relaxed , for the particular case of the chemical enrichment of the galactic halo surrounded by dsph and ufd galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our chemical evolution models for the galaxy , dsph and ufd galaxies , in section 3 we describe the way in which we implement the enriched gas infall on the chemical evolution of the galactic halo . the results are presented in section 4 . finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 ..",
    "in this work for the first time we present a chemical evolution model where we assume that the galactic halo is formed by accretion of enriched gas with chemical abundances identical to those of gas outflowing / stripped from dsph , and ufd galaxies . in this section",
    "we will give some details related to the reference chemical evolution models considered in this paper for the mw , dsph , and ufd galaxies .",
    "for the star formation rate ( sfr ) all the milky way models adopt the following kennicutt ( 1998 ) like law : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the star formation efficiency , @xmath10 is the surface gas density , and @xmath11 is the gas surface exponent , with an exponent k=1.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sfrs of dsph and ufd galaxies are considered proportional to the volume gas density @xmath12 with an exponent k=1 : @xmath13    in romano et al .",
    "( 2015 ) it is recalled that originally kennicutt ( 1998 ) law refers to surface densities .",
    "they show that for star - forming regions with roughly constant scaleheights , the surface densities can be turned into volume densities .",
    "moreover , using the fact that the kennicutt law indicates that the star formation rate is controlled by the self - gravity of the gas , it is possible to show the equivalence between k=1.5 in eq .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) and k=1 in eq .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) .",

( 2013 ) , which is an updated version of the two - infall model of chiappini et al . ( 1997 ) .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to have formed by means of two main infall episodes : the first formed the halo and the thick disc , the second the thin disc .",
    "the accretion law of a certain element @xmath37 at the time @xmath38 and galactocentric distance @xmath39 is defined as : @xmath40 the quantity @xmath41 is the abundance by mass of the element @xmath37 in the infalling material , while @xmath42 gyr is the time for the maximum infall on the thin disc , @xmath43 gyr is the time scale for the formation of the halo and thick - disc and @xmath44 is the timescale for the formation of the thin disc and is a function of the galactocentric distance ( inside - out formation , matteucci & franois , 1989 ; chiappini et al .",

    "in fact , the total surface mass density in the solar vicinity is @xmath53 71 @xmath50 pc@xmath51 ( kuijken & gilmore 1991 ) with @xmath53 54 @xmath50 pc@xmath51 corresponding to the disc surface mass density .",

    "]    moreover , in fig .",
    "[ o1 ] we show the effects of the enriched infall with chemical abundances taken by the outflowing gas from dsph and ufd objects on the [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation . in particular , we compare the reference 2im model for the galactic halo ( which assumes primordial infall ) with the `` 2im+dsph '' and `` 2im+ufd '' models ( enriched infall following model i ) and ii ) prescriptions , respectively ) ; in the same figure , we show also the `` 2im+ dsph mix '' and `` 2im+ufd mix '' models , with chemical abundances of the outflowing gas from dsph and ufd being diluted with primordial ones .",
    "first we analyze the results with the enriched infall coming from dsph galaxies .",
    "we see that for oxygen we obtain a better agreement with the data in the halo phase when we consider the enriched infall models .",
    "we recall that a key ingredient of the 2im model is the presence of a threshold in the gas density in the star formation ( sf ) fixed at 4 m@xmath7 pc@xmath51 in the halo - thick disc phase . during the halo phase such",
    "a critical threshold is reached only at @xmath73 from the galaxy formation . on the other hand ,",
    "when including the environmental effect , we have to consider also the time for the onset of the galactic wind , which in the dsph model occurs at @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the sf begins after 0.356 gyr from the beginning of galaxy formation , and this fact explains the behavior of the curves with enriched infalls in fig .",
    "[ o1 ] : during the first 0.356 gyr in both `` 2im+dsph '' and `` 2im+dsph mix '' models , no stars are created , and the chemical evolution is traced by the exponential gas accretion with a time dependent chemical enrichment ( eq . [ a ] ) .    in fig . [ o1 ] and in all the successive figures we indicate with thinner lines the ism chemical evolution phases in which the sfr did not start yet in the galactic halo , and during which stars are no created .    to summarize , for the model `` 2im+dsph",
    "'' we distinguish three different phases in the halo chemical evolution :    * phase 1 ) : 0 - 0.013 gyr , the infall is primordial , the wind in dsphs has not started yet , and there is no sf ; * phase 2 ) : 0.013 - 0.356 gyr , the infall is enriched by dsphs , the sfr is zero in this phase ; * phase 3 ) : 0.356 - 1 gyr ; the infall is enriched by dsphs , the sfr is different from zero .    during phase 3 ) , the sf takes over , and increases the [ o / fe ] values because of the pollution from massive stars on short time - scales .     the evolution in time for oxygen but for the 2imw model . ]",
    "we note that the entire spread of the data can not be explained assuming a time dependent enriched infall with the same abundances of the outflowing gas from dsph galaxies , even if there is a better agreement with the halo data in comparison to the model with primordial infall .",
    "it is important to underline that , until the sf is non - zero , no stars are created ; however , since our models follow the chemical abundances in the gas phase , the solely contribution to the ism chemical evolution before sf begins is due to the time dependent enriched infall .",
    "it means that in the `` 2im+dsph '' model the first stars that are formed have [ fe / h ] values larger than -2.4 dex .    in this case , to explain data for stars with [ fe / h ] smaller than -2.4 dex we need stars formed in dsph systems ( see the model curve of the chemical evolution of dsph galaxies ) .     as a function of [ fe / h ] in the solar neighborhood . as in fig .",

    "the various curves with different colors represent the same chemical evolution models as in fig .",
    "as concluded for the [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] abundance diagram , our reference chemical evolution models for dsph and ufd galaxies can not explain the observed galactic halo data over the entire range of [ fe / h ] abundances .",
    "this rules out the hypothesis that all galactic halo stars were stripped or accreted in the past from dsphs or ufds .",

    "it is worth noting that for the @xmath0 elements studied in this work , all models predictionsincluding the enriched infall of gas , tend to the [ @xmath0/fe ] values of the reference model for high [ fe / h ] in the halo phase .",

    "[ ba1 ] , one can also appreciate that our chemical evolution models for dsphs and ufds fail in reproducing the observed data , since they predict the [ ba / fe ] ratios to increase at much lower [ fe / h ] abundances than the observed data . concerning the chemical evolution of the ba for dsphs , our predictions are in agreement with lanfranchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where they compared the evolution of @xmath77- and @xmath39- process elements in our galaxy with that in dsph galaxies .",
    "that is due to the very low sfes assumed for dsphs and ufds , which cause the first ba - polluters to enrich the ism at extremely low [ fe / h ] abundances .",
    "the subsequent decrease of the [ ba / fe ] ratios is due to the large iron content deposited by type ia sne in the ism , which happens at still very low [ fe / h ] abundances in dsphs and ufds .",

    "[ ba1 ] , all our models involving an enriched infall from dsphs and ufds deviate substantially from the observed trend of the [ ba / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] abundance pattern in galactic halo stars .",

    "is characterized by an outflow gas rate proportional to the sfr and by a smaller formation timescale @xmath79 than the one of the model 2im ( see table 1 ) . a shorter formation time - scale leads to a faster chemical evolution at the early times .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig . 2 of brusadin et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the sfr starts at 0.05 gyr , since the critical threshold in the surface gas density is reached earlier .    as done above , for the model `` 2imw+dsph '' we distinguish three different phases in the halo chemical evolution :    * phase 1 ) : 0 - 0.013 gyr , the infall is primordial , the wind in dsphs has not started yet and there is no star formation ; * phase 2 ) : 0.013 - 0.05 gyr , the infall is enriched by dsphs , the sfr is zero in this phase ; * phase 3 ) : 0.05- 1 gyr ; the infall is enriched by dsphs , the sfr is different from zero .    on one hand , comparing model `` 2imw+dsph '' in fig .",

    "[ ow ] with model `` 2im+ufd '' in fig .",
    "[ o1 ] , we see that the former overlap to the reference model 2imw at almost all [ fe / h ] abundances .",
    "in fact , since in the ufd galactic model the wind starts at 0.088 gyr and , at this instant , in the model 2imw the sf is already active ( the sf activity begins at 0.05 gyr ) , the phase 2 ) evolution ( namely , chemical evolution without sf ) is not present in the 2imw+ufd model",
    ". therefore the effect of the enriched infall is almost negligible compared to the pollution of chemical elements produced by dying halo stars , since we can not distinguish between the effect of an enriched infall from ufds and the chemical feedback provided by the type ii sne originated in the galactic halo itself .",

    "we are aware that for ba more detailed data are needed , therefore at this stage we can not draw firm conclusions .",
    "we note that in general [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in dsphs and ufds can overlap with those of halo stars at very low metallicity where in all galaxies the chemical enrichment is dominated by the nucleosynthesis of core collapse sne .",
    "this makes difficult to test whether some stars from dwarf satellites have indeed been accreted by the halo .",
    "rather , it is likely that a fraction as high as 50% of the gas out of which the halo formed has been shed by its satellite systems , whose relics we see ( in part ) nowadays , devoid of their gas .",
    "this is only valid for satellite systems with a very short duration of star formation , as modelled in this paper .",
    "more realistic sfh would create ejected gas with low [ @xmath0/fe ] ( as seen in the stars in the surviving luminous dsph ) and conflict with the data for halo stars .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have identified in the [ ba / fe ] ratios a better discriminant of the origin of halo stars .",

    "our predictions have been convolved with a gaussian with an error of 0.2 dex . as pointed out by brusadin et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the reference model 2im is not able to reproduce the peak of the distribution . only assuming a shorter formation time - scale coupled with a gas outflow event in the galactic halo chemical evolution ( model 2imw ) we are able to properly fit the observed distribution",
    "anyway , in both cases the enriched infall of gas from dsph and ufd objects does not affect the distributions . in fig .",
    "[ gaussofe ] the g - dwarf distribution is shown as a function of the [ o / fe ] ratio . here , both models 2im and 2imw , including the enriched infall models show the peak at 0.5 dex .",
    "in this paper , we first have explored the hypothesis that dsph and ufd galaxies are the survived building blocks of the galactic halo , by assuming that the halo formed by accretion of stars belonging to these galaxies .",
    "then , we have presented a different scenario in which the galactic halo formed by accretion of enriched gas with the same chemical composition as the outflowing gas from dsphs and ufds .",
    "finally , we have tested the effect of diluting the infalling material from dsphs or ufds with primordial gas of different extra - galactic origin .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we find that the predicted [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] abundance patterns of ufd and dsph chemical evolution models deviate substantially from the observed data of the galactic halo stars only for [ fe / h ] values larger than -2 dex ; this means that at those metallicities the chemical evolution of the galactic halo was different than in the satellite galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", we notice that for ba the chemical evolution models of dsphs and ufds fail to reproduce the observational observed data of the galactic halo stars over the whole range of [ fe / h ] .",
    "2 .   we can safely rule out the hypothesis that the stellar halo of the mw entirely formed from the merging of galaxies which were the ancestors of the current dsphs and ufds .",
    "our results are in agreement with the previous suggestions of unavane et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and venn et al .",
    "we can not rule out , however , the hypothesis that a substantial contribution to the formation of the galaxy stellar halo was provided by a population of dwarf galaxies which were more massive and more evolved from the point of view of the ism chemical evolution than the current dsphs and ufds .",
    "3 .   concerning the chemical evolution models for the mw in the presence of enriched gas infall we obtain that : the effects on the [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plots depend on the infall time scale for the formation of the halo and the presence of a gas threshold in the star formation . in fact",
    ", the most evident effects are present for the model 2im , characterized by the longest time scale of formation ( 0.8 gyr ) , and the longest period without star formation activity among all models presented here .",
    "4 .   in general ,",
    "the enriched infall by itself is not capable to explain the observational spread in the halo data at low [ fe / h ] , in the [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plots .",
    "moreover , in the presence of an enriched infall we need stars produced in situ in dsph or ufd objects and accreted later to the galactic halo , to explain the data at lowest [ fe / h ] values .",
    "the optimal element to test different theories of halo formation is barium which is ( relatively ) easily measured in low - metallicity stars .",
    "in fact , we have shown that the predicted [ ba / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation in dsphs and ufds is quite different than in the galactic halo . moreover ,",
    "the [ ba / fe ] ratio can be substantially influenced by the assumption of an enriched infall .",
