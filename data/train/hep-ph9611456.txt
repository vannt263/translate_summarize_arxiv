    "in the last years , diffractive scattering processes have received increasing attention for several reasons .",
    "these processes may , for example , explain many features of particle production and , in particular , heavy flavour production @xcite and centauro events @xcite .",
    "they are also related to the large rapidity gap physics and the structure of the pomeron @xcite . in a diffractive scattering ,",
    "one of the incoming hadrons emerges from the collision only slightly deflected and there is a large rapidity gap between it and the other final state particles resulted from the other excited hadron . in some models diffraction is due to the pomeron exchange but the exact nature of the pomeron in qcd is not elucidated yet .",
    "the first test of a theory ( or a model ) of diffractive dissociation ( dd ) is the ability to properly describe the mass ( @xmath0 ) distribution of diffractive systems , which has been measured in many experiments @xcite and parametrized as @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "data presented in @xcite were taken at the tevatron collider ( @xmath3 tev ) .",
    "they allow us to make comparison with cern @xcite lower energies data and observe the energy dependence of the mass spectrum . in the old regge theory",
    ", the assumption of pomeron dominance implies that the mass spectrum behaves like @xmath4 and does not depend on the energy @xcite whereas in @xcite a slight deviation from this behaviour was reported .",
    "+ in this work we intend to study diffractive mass distributions using the interacting gluon model ( igm ) developed by us recently @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the energy dependence of these distributions and their connection with inelasticity distributions @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the igm is that it was designed in such a way that the energy - momentum conservation is taken care of before all other dynamical aspects .",
    "this feature makes it very appropriate for the study of energy flow in high energy hadronic and nuclear reactions @xcite and in cosmic ray studies @xcite .",
    "in particular , as shown in @xcite , the igm was very usefull in analysing data and making predictions on the behaviour of inelasticities and leading particle spectra , including leading charm production @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to demonstrate that the main characteristics of the dd processes mentioned above emerge naturally from the standard igm , enlarging profoundly its range of applications .",
    "+ in the following section we present for readers convenience the basic elements of the igm .",
    "it is then applied to dd processes in section 3 where we also carefully explain what dd means in terms of the igm and how it differs from the conventional regge pomeron approach .",
    "section 4 contains our numerical results and comparison with data and the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the interacting gluon model is based on the following idea @xcite : since about half of a hadron momentum is carried by gluons and since gluons interact more strongly than quarks , during a collision there is a separation of constituents .",
    "valence quarks tend to be fast forming leading particles whereas gluons tend to be stopped in the central rapidity region .",
    "this picture is consistent with string formation and fragmentation as it is formulated in the lund model or in the dual parton model .",
    "these models are based on the concept of string and were constructed to work at low average transverse momenta .",
    "when , in the late eighties , the energy of hadronic collisions increased by more than one order of magnitude it became necessary to incorporate the concept of parton and of hard and semi - hard collisions .",
    "the latter are collisions between partons at a moderate scale ( @xmath5 ) which however still allows for the use of perturbative qcd .",
    "the scattered partons form the so - called minijets . at @xmath6 gev the minijet cross section is already @xmath7 of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "a new generation of models appeared using the concept of parton and the qcd parton model formalism and trying to understand minimum - bias multiparticle physics extending the parton model to semihard ( moderate ) energy scales . among these models we mention those presented by gaisser and stanev @xcite , sjostrand @xcite , wang @xcite and geiger @xcite .",
    "the igm belongs to this class of models . in all these models",
    "one finds at a certain point expresssions of the type @xmath8 where f and @xmath9 are parton momentum distribution and parton - parton elementary cross section respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the scale .",
    "apart from some ambiguity in choosing the scale , these models have to face the problem that even at very high energies a significant part of a hadronic collision occurs at scales lower than the semihard one . at this point",
    "f and @xmath9 are not very well known .",
    "the atitude taken in hijing @xcite , in the parton cascade model @xcite and also in the igm is to extrapolate these quantities to lower scales .",
    "these extrapolations can be continuously improved , especially in view of the advance of our knowledge on non - perturbative effects .",
    "there are , for example , models for distribution functions which work at scales as low as @xmath11 @xcite . as for @xmath9",
    "one can compute non - perturbative effects in the context of an operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "inspite of these limitations these models have the advantage of dealing with partons and being thus prepaired to incorporate perturbative qcd in a natural way .",
    "this is welcome since perturbative processes are expected to be increasingly important at higher energies .",
    "compared to the other models mentioned above , the igm is simpler because it is designed to study energy flow and makes no attempt to calculate cross sections or to follow hadronization in great detail .",
    "this simplifies the calculations and avoids time consuming numerical simulations .",
    "the most important aspect of the igm , shared with those models , is the assumption of multiple parton - parton incoherent scattering which is implicit in the poissonian distribution of the number of parton - parton collisions ( which is also used in refs .",
    "@xcite ) used below . in going to lower resolution scales this independent collision approximation becomes questionable . on the other hand lattice qcd calculations @xcite in the strong coupling regime",
    "indicate that the typical correlation length of the soft gluon fields is around @xmath12 fm .",
    "this is still smaller than the typical hadronic size .",
    "therefore the independent collision approximation may still be a reasonable one . from the practical point of view , it was shown in @xcite that replacing the poissonian distribution by a broader one does not affect the results significantly as long as some mass scale is introduced to cut off the very low x region .",
    "the igm is based on the assumed dominance of hadronic collisions by gluonic interactions @xcite and can be summarized as follows @xcite ( cf .",
    "1a ) :    * the two colliding hadrons are represented by valence quarks carrying their quantum numbers ( charges ) plus the accompanying clouds of gluons ( which represent also the sea @xmath13 pairs and therefore should be regarded as effective ones ) . *",
    "in the course of a collision gluonic clouds interact strongly and form a gluonic _ central fireball _",
    "( cf ) located in the central region of the reaction . * the valence quarks ( plus those gluons which did not interact )",
    "get excited and form _ leading jets _",
    "( lj s ) ( or _ beam jets _ ) which then populate mainly the fragmentation regions of the reaction .",
    "it should be stressed that the igm has been formulated originally in order to give the initial conditions for hydrodynamical models by providing in a dynamical way the so called _ inelasticity _ of the reaction understood usually as the ( invariant ) fraction of energy stored in the cf : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the fractions of the initial energy - momenta of the respective projectiles allocated to the cf .",
    "this variable and , in particular , its energy dependence is of vital importance in cosmic ray studies as it is the necessary ingredient allowing to deduce any elementary information from cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "according to the igm , pairs of gluons collide and form `` minifireballs '' ( mf s ) . in collisions at higher scales a minifireball is the same as a pair of minijets or jets . in the study of energy",
    "flow the details of fragmentation and hadron production are not important .",
    "most of the mf s will be in the central region and we assume that they coalesce forming the cf .",
    "the probability to form a fireball carrying momentum fractions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of two colliding hadrons is defined as the sum over ( an undefined number @xmath17 of ) mf s @xcite : @xmath18 ( all masses and transverse momenta are neglected in what follows ) .",
    "the distribution of the number of mf s is given by @xmath19 for which we use poisson distributions : @xmath20 corresponding to independent production . expressing the delta functions via fourier integrals one can perform all summations ,",
    "transform certain summations over @xmath21 into integrals and make the replacement @xmath22 arriving at the general formula @xcite : @xmath23 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 being a normalization factor defined by the condition that @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the minimal inelasticity defined by the mass @xmath29 of the lightest possible cf .",
    "the , so called , spectral function @xmath30 contains all the dynamical input of the igm in the general form of ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 s denote the effective number of gluons from the corresponding projectiles ( approximated by the respective gluonic structure functions ) and @xmath33 and @xmath9 the gluonic and hadronic cross sections , respectively",
    ". these are basic formulae of the igm from which all its applications are derived @xcite .",
    "it is now quite straightforward to extend the igm also to diffractive dissociation processes . in fig .",
    "1b we show schematically the igm picture of a diffractive dissociation event . unlike in fig .",
    "1a here only one of the protons looses fraction @xmath15 of its original momentum and gets excited forming a lj carrying @xmath34 fraction of the initial momentum . the other one , which we shall call here the diffracted proton , looses only a fraction @xmath16 of its momentum but otherwise remains intact @xcite . in the standard igm presented in the previous section we were computing the probability @xmath35 of depositing energy fractions @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the central region in the form of gluonic cf of mass @xmath36 , which subsequently was decaying and producing particles . here",
    "we shall be rather interested in the mass @xmath0 , a new variable in our problem , which , as can be seen in fig .",
    "1b , is just the invariant mass of a system composed of the cf and the leading jet formed by one of the colliding protons ( we shall call it also _ diffractive mass _ ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath37 and @xmath38 the energy and momentum of the upper ( in fig .",
    "1b ) proton and by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the energy and momentum of the cf , @xmath41 the energy @xmath42 and momentum @xmath43 of the diffractive cluster are given by : @xmath44 leading to the following expressions for the mass of our diffractive cluster , @xmath0 , and its rapidity , @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the invariant energy of the @xmath48 system .",
    "we are working in the cm frame of the incoming nucleons .",
    "all masses have been neglected @xcite .",
    "+ in the limit @xmath49 , the whole available energy is stored in @xmath0 which remains then at rest , i.e. , @xmath50 . for small values of @xmath16",
    "we have small masses @xmath0 located at large rapidities @xmath45 . in order to regard our process as being trully of the dd type we must assume that all gluons from the target proton participating in the collision ( i.e. , those emitted from the lower vertex in fig .",
    "1b ) _ have to form a colour singlet_. only then a large rapidity gap will form separating the diffracted proton ( in the lower part of our fig . 1 ) and the @xmath0 system ( in its upper part ) , which is the experimental requirement defining a diffractive event . otherwise a colour string would develop , connecting the diffracted proton and the diffractive cluster , and would eventually decay , filling the rapidity gap with produced secondaries . in this way we are effectively introducing an object resembling closely ( but by no means identical to ) what is known as pomeron ( @xmath51 ) and therefore in what follows",
    "we shall use this notion as a handy abbreviation of notation @xcite .",
    "the probability of finding the `` bunch '' of gluons ( that forms the pomeron ) mentioned above in a colour singlet configuration is not computable at a more fundamental level because the model is simple and does not involve colour quantum numbers explicitely .",
    "however this probability is represented indirectly in the cross section between the gluonic bunch and the other proton , the parameter @xmath9 discussed below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defsig ] ) .    in our approach the definition of the object",
    "@xmath51 is essentially only kinematical @xcite , very much in the spirit of those used in all other works which deal with diffractive processes in the parton and/or string language @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore try to derive the whole @xmath52 dependence directly from the igm .",
    "our first step necessary to adapt the standard igm to dd collisions will be the introduction a kinematical restriction in the formula for the moments eq.([eq : defmom ] ) preventing gluons coming from the diffracted proton ( and forming our object @xmath51 ) to carry more energy than the one released in the diffractive system .",
    "therefore we shall write it as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and the meaning of the spectral function @xmath30 remains the same as before .",
    "+ we can now calculate the diffractive mass distribution @xmath0 using the @xmath35 function by simply performing a change of variables ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : mass ] ) ) , @xmath55 in the igm @xcite the distribution @xmath35 is a wide gaussian in the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 changing slowly with the energy @xmath47 . substituting now eq.([eq : chi ] ) into eq.([eq : res ] ) we arrive at the following simple expression for the diffractive mass distribution : @xmath56 where @xmath57 \\label{eq : fff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath58 \\right\\ } .\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the moments @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by ( [ eq : defmomd ] ) and are the only place where dynamical quantities like the gluonic and hadronic cross sections appear in the igm .",
    "at this point we emphasize that we are all the time dealing with a proton- proton scattering .",
    "however , as was said above , we are in fact selecting a special class of events and therefore we must choose the correct dynamical inputs in the present situation , specially the gluon distribution inside the diffracted proton and the hadronic cross section @xmath9 appearing in @xmath61 .",
    "as a first approximation we shall take @xmath62 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , with @xmath63 , with m=5 , the same already used by us before @xcite .",
    "the amount of the diffracted nucleon momentum , _ p _ , allocated specifically to the @xmath51 gluonic cluster and the hadronic cross section @xmath9 are both unknown .",
    "however , they always appear as a ratio ( @xmath64 ) of parameters in @xmath61 and different choices are possible .",
    "just in order to make contact with the present knowledge about the pomeron , we shall choose @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 and a and b are parameters to be fixed from data analysis .",
    "as it will be seen , @xmath68 turns out to be a very slowly varying function of @xmath47 assuming values between 2.6 and 3.0 mb , which is a well accepted value for the pomeron - proton cross section , and @xmath69 .",
    "+ before performing a full numerical calculation let us estimate eqs.([eq : dis ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) keeping only the most singular parts of the gluonic distributions used ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) and collecting all other factors in eq.([eq : omega ] ) in a single parameter @xmath71 .",
    "let us first assume that the ratio of the cross sections @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath15 and @xmath16 . neglecting all terms of the order of @xmath73 and @xmath74 we arrive at the following expressions for the moments calculated in eq.([eq : defmomd ] ) : @xmath75 notice that in all cases of interest @xmath76 is much smaller than other moments ( by a factor @xmath77 , at least ) .",

    "the other two terms have a weaker dependence on @xmath83 .",
    "they distort the main ( @xmath82 ) curve in opposite directions and tend to compensate each other .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to note that even before choosing a very detailed form for the gluon distributions and hadronic cross sections we obtain analytically the typical shape of a diffractive spectrum .",
    "in fig . 2a we show our diffractive mass spectrum and compare it to experimental data from the cern - isr @xcite , which are usually parametrized by the form @xmath82 .",
    "these spectra were calculated with expression ( [ eq : dis ] ) with the same gluon distributions , cross sections and the mass parameter @xmath29 ( @xmath84 mev ) used in previous works @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen , the agreement between our curves and data is reasonable . at large values of @xmath85 ,",
    "experimental points start to flatten out , deviating from the @xmath82 behaviour",
    ". this may be due to the contribution of non - diffractive events .",
    "we expect therefore some discrepancy between theory and experiment in this region . at very low values of @xmath85 and lower energies",
    "@xmath47 our model does not give a good description of data . here again some discrepancy should be expected because we are neglecting all resonance effects . in principle",
    "a better agreement between theory and data could be achieved in this region .",
    "it would be enough to choose @xmath86 mev keeping everything else as before .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "a discrepancy persists at very low masses at the lowest center of mass energy @xmath47 .",
    "however this region is almost beyond the validity domain of the model . instead of changing @xmath29 ( which would also require a change in our previous works ) , we prefer to keep its usual value . given the qualitative nature of the present work , we choose to be consistent with our previous works in prejudice of the quality of the fits .",
    "fig.3 and 4 show similar comparisons for @xmath87 and @xmath88 gev respectively .",
    "data are from refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "again we find reasonable agreement with experiment . in the low @xmath85 region at higher @xmath47 the agreement is very good .",
    "all the curves above were obtained with @xmath89  mb and @xmath90  mb .",
    "+ as a straightforward extension of our calculation we now apply expression ( [ eq : dis ] ) to the study of diffractive pion - proton and kaon - proton scattering .",
    "we first consider the cases @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this corresponds to replace the proton by a pion or a kaon in the upper line of fig .",
    "1b , everything else remaining the same .",
    "we must also substitute the gluon distributions in the proton , @xmath93 , by the corresponding gluon distributions in the pion and kaon , taken from @xcite . here , for simplicity , we take @xmath94 .",
    "this is supported by an accmor collaboration data analysis @xcite .",
    "we also assume that @xmath95 .",
    "the comparison between our results and data from the ehs / na22 collaboration @xcite is shown in figs .",
    "5a ( pions ) and 5b ( kaons ) . we may also have diffracted mesons , which undergo reactions of the type @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this corresponds to replace the proton by a pion or a kaon in the lower line of fig .",
    "1b , substituting also the corresponding gluon distributions .",
    "the comparison between our results and experimental data @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "6a ( pions ) and 6b ( kaons ) . as it can be seen , a good description of data is obtained .",
    "+ let us consider now the energy dependence of our results .",
    "the cdf collaboration studied single diffractive events and found some energy dependence in the diffractive mass spectrum .",
    "this fact is illustrated by writing @xmath98 where the factor @xmath99 which has been reported to be @xcite @xmath100 at @xmath101 gev and @xmath102 at @xmath103 gev , respectively . considering the error bars",
    "one might say that this value is just constant ( and that there would be no indication of energy dependence ) , but a real ( albeit small one ) change in @xmath99 is not excluded . therefore",
    ", if confirmed , it would mean that the distribution becomes slightly broader .",
    "+ in the igm everything is from the beginning energy dependent and so should be the diffractive mass distribution .",
    "we start analysing the analytical approximation eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dis],[eq : f ] , [ eq : newapprh ] ) . in ( [ eq : newapprh ] ) we see that the @xmath104-dependence factorizes and the function @xmath105 has the same shape for all energies , the difference being only a multiplying factor ( in numerical calculations this behaviour is slightly violated ) . in ( [ eq : f ] ) the @xmath104-dependence does not factorize and remains in the moments or , equivalently , in the variable @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath106 is a broad function with maximum value determined by the moment  @xmath107 which increases with the energy , making @xmath108 to `` rotate '' in a way that it becomes higher at lower values of @xmath83 and becomes deeper at larger values of @xmath83 . when we multiply @xmath109 ( which goes essntially like @xmath110 ) by @xmath108 it becomes steeper .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is illustrated in fig .",
    "7a and 7b respectively , which show the numerical evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fff ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) . the result of the numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis ] ) is presented in fig .",
    "there we show the energy dependence of our diffractive mass spectra in proton - proton scattering .",
    "8a shows diffractive mass spectra for @xmath111 gev ( solid lines ) , @xmath112 gev ( dashed lines ) and @xmath113 gev ( dotted lines ) .",
    "8b shows spectra at @xmath114 tev ( solid lines ) , @xmath115 tev ( dashed lines ) and @xmath116 tev ( dotted lines ) .",
    "finally fig .",
    "8c shows our prediction for the diffractive mass spectrum at lhc ( @xmath117 tev ) compared to the tevatron one .",
    "the spectra in fig . 8a and 8b are the same of figs . 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behaviour that we find is not in contradiction with data . in all curves",
    "we observe a modest narrowing as the energy increases .",
    "this small effect means that the diffractive mass becomes a smaller fraction of the available energy @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , the `` diffractive inelasticity '' decreases with energy and consequently the `` diffracted leading particles '' follow a harder @xmath118 spectrum .",
    "physically , in the context of the igm , this means that the deposited energy is increasing with @xmath47 but it will be mostly released outside the phase space region that we are selecting .",
    "a measure of the `` diffractive inelasticity '' is the quantity @xmath119 . making a trivial change of variables in eq.([eq : dis ] )",
    "we can calculate its average value @xmath120 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) are the same used in ( @xcite ) for the purpose of comparison . in fig .",
    "9 we plot @xmath126 against @xmath47 .",
    "as it can be seen @xmath120 decreases with @xmath47 not only because @xmath122 becomes smaller but also because @xmath127 changes with the energy , falling faster .",
    "this qualitative behaviour of @xmath120 is in agreement with the estimate of the same quantity extracted from cosmic ray data analysis @xcite .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "9 is the quantity @xmath128 ( which has been discussed in @xcite in connection with the energy dependence of the single diffractive cross - section ) for @xmath129  ( dashed lines ) and  @xmath130  ( dotted lines ) .",
    "+ the energy behaviour of @xmath131 is determined by the moments ( [ eq : defmomd ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "since @xmath132 and @xmath93 are the same as in previous works , being thus fixed , the only source of uncertainty in the @xmath104-dependence of the results is in the ratio @xmath64 , which is the only free parameter in the model .",
    "all curves presented above were obtained with the choice ( [ eq : defsig ] ) made for @xmath9 and with @xmath133 .",
    "we have checked that for a stronger growth of @xmath134 with @xmath47 the energy behaviour of @xmath131 might become even the opposite of the one found here , i.e. , the diffractive mass distribution would become broader at higher energies .",
    "however these strongly @xmath104-dependent parametrizations do not give an acceptable description of the existing data and were therefore excluded .",
    "considering what was said above one might think that we can discriminate between different pomeron - proton cross sections and we could use this model to extract @xmath134 from data .",
    "we stress however that , in this model , only the ratio @xmath64 enters effectively in the calculations and it is impossible to completely disentangle these two variables . in this sense , the almost constancy ( with @xmath47 ) of @xmath134 may be just an indication of some increase of @xmath135 with @xmath47 in a way that the ratio @xmath64 `` scales '' with the energy .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that :    * the original igm ( @xcite ) is reasonably successful in describing non - diffractive events . with only two natural changes , namely the introduction of the kinematical cut - off @xmath136 and the multiplication of the function @xmath61 by a constant factor reflecting the essentially unknown combination of @xmath51-proton cross section @xmath9 and the amount of gluonic energy - momentum of the diffractive proton allocated to the object @xmath51 , @xmath135 ( in form of the ratio @xmath64 ) , ( with all other parameters kept as in previous applications of igm ) it turns out to be also able to provide a reasonable description of diffractive events @xcite and their energy dependence .",
    "we predict that , at higher energies , a narrowing of the @xmath83 distribution may be observed .",
    "* as is obvious from fig .",
    "1b , it provides a detailed description of the diffractive cluster ( of mass @xmath0 ) , _ disentangling _ it in a natural way into gluonic cluster of mass @xmath137 containing the majority of produced secondaries ( which corresponds to cf in the original igm ) and leading jet ( inside the diffractive system ) with momentum fraction @xmath138 carrying quantum numbers of the diffractively excited projectile .",
    "this fact may be very usefull for the cosmic ray applications of the igm , in particular to studies using dd like those presented in @xcite ( where such disentanglement seems to be important and so far was introduced in an _ ad hoc _ way only ) .    :",
