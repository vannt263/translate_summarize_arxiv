    "a major paradigm shift is now taking place in astronomy and space science .",
    "astronomy has suddenly become an immensely data - rich field , with numerous digital sky surveys across a range of wavelengths , with many terabytes of pixels and with billions of detected sources , often with tens of measured parameters for each object .",
    "this is a great change from the past , when often a single object or small samples of objects were used in individual studies .",
    "instead , we can now map the universe systematically , and in a panchromatic manner .",
    "this will enable quantitatively and qualitatively new science , from statistical studies of our galaxy and the large - scale structure in the universe , to the discoveries of rare , unusual , or even completely new types of astronomical objects and phenomena .",
    "this new digital sky , data - mining astronomy will also enable and empower scientists and students anywhere , without an access to large telescopes , to do first - rate science .",
    "this can only invigorate the field , as it opens the access to unprecedented amounts of data to a fresh pool of talent .",
    "the resulting wealth of data from the wide range of surveys , satellite missions , and ground - based observatories provides enormous new scientific opportunities .",
    "archiving , distributing and exploring all of this data , however , is an extremely challenging , yet vital , problem .",
    "this fact was recognized by the national academy of science astronomy and astrophysics survey committee , which , in its new decadal survey ( astronomy and astrophysics in the new millennium ) , recommends , as a first priority , the establishment of a national virtual observatory .",
    "we consider this an extremely important edict , and encourage the rest of the astronomical community to work towards the successful implementation of not just a single national facility , but a global network of interconnected virtual observatories .",
    "after all , the universe does not know of our artificially imposed geographical boundaries , everyone suffers from the data overload .    at a fundamental level ,",
    "several complimentary effects drive this data tsunami .",
    "primary among these is the incredible changes that have arisen from the application of new technology .",
    "moore s law , a well - known observation , roughly states that silicon - based device capacity doubles every 18 months .",
    "the most noticeable effect from this observation is the incredible advances in computational speed and power , something that is most definitely not limited to the field of astronomy . as a result , we have storage systems that allow us to archive our data , and the growth of the internet and the world wide web simplifies the process of accessing highly distributed data . on the other hand , moore s law is also driving the growth in detector technology ; giga - pixel arrays are on the horizon and even more powerful devices are in the pipeline , resulting in ever increasing data streams .",
    "this data tsunami is not a one - time event , the driving mechanisms continue to operate and increase in amplitude .    another important driver results from the globalization of astronomy . over the last decade",
    "there has been a tremendous growth in both the number and power of telescopes being built around the world . at the same time",
    ", a range of multi - wavelength space missions is pushing the limits of our understanding , and providing new views on our cosmos . in the end , we will not only have the electromagnetic spectrum opened before us , but also the gravitational , astroparticle and time domains . not to be left behind ,",
    "computer simulations are rivaling the largest observational datasets in both size and complexity , providing new approaches to understanding the universe .    from the previous discussion",
    ", the current state of astronomy would seem to be glorious .",
    "the true situation , however , is hampered by several limiting forces , most notably the human factor .",
    "funding for the scientific exploration of the wealth of data that is inundating our field is inadequate to the task .",
    "furthermore , astronomers are not trained to handle such large datasets , and , as a result , the data that is so expensively obtained is not completely explored . finally ,",
    "since general data archiving and distribution facilities , especially of homogeneous , large area surveys are not commonly available , observations are often repeated , either due to ignorance or by necessity , as a result of geographical , cultural , or proprietary forces .",
    "at some level , everyone is familiar with the awe - inspiring pageantry of the night sky , and most people are familiar with the basics of a telescope . for the professional astronomer ,",
    "obtaining astronomical data from the ground is generally performed at observatories that are often located on remote mountain peaks .",
    "these observatories support the discovery process by providing access to telescopes and instruments that are suited for different types of observations . at a fundamental level ,",
    "the telescope s sole function is to gather photons and feed them to the appropriate instrument , which is designed to analyze the incoming photons and to , hopefully , extract the desired signal .",
    "there are a large number of observatories , distributed worldwide , which share information on how to build and improve telescopes and instrumentation , and , occasionally , the actual physical hardware .",
    "this description provides a useful framework for building a mental picture of how a network of virtual observatories would operate . rather than starting with the physical universe ,",
    "we start with the digital universe , consisting of the vast quantities of archived data , from both ground- and space - based observatories . in order to explore this new paradigm ,",
    "we need virtual observatories , which serve as portals into the digital realm",
    ". their primary function would be to provide access to virtual telescopes that serve to gather , not photons , but the bits of information that are relevant to a given query from the vast sea of information .",
    "virtual instruments will be used to process the resulting data stream , extracting out the desired result . due to their inherent `` soft '' nature",
    ", these virtual telescopes and instruments can be easily reconfigured , expanded , and ultimately improved in order to tackle the next data discovery challenge .    with this mental paradigm in place",
    ", we can now more clearly define a `` virtual observatory '' .",
    "first , a virtual observatory would be global in nature , distributed in scope across institutions , agencies , and countries .",
    "in addition , a virtual observatory being based on the internet would be continuously available to everyone , both in the astronomical community , as well as the general public , wherever they might be located .",
    "unlike traditional observatories , the infrastructure for a virtual observatory can not be physically located in a single location , following the `` click - and - order '' not `` brick - and - mortar '' philosophy which drives the net - economy .",
    "this is a necessary consequence of the fact that virtual observatories would support astronomical observations via remote access to digital representations of the sky .",
    "finally , virtual observatories must provide general support for astronomical explorations of large areas of the sky at multiple wavelengths , and enable discovery via new computational and statistical tools .",
    "the architecture for a virtual observatory , would , therefore , follow a grid - based pattern , where different data providers , which are broadly distributed in both geography and resources , are interconnected to both the user community , and specialized compute servers .",
    "this hierarchical approach allows existing services that have developed over time to support individual satellite missions , observatories , or surveys to be easily integrated , while simultaneously allowing for future growth .",
    "other scientific disciplines are experiencing similar deluges of data , and we need to work together , maximizing our joint resources to solve our common problems .",
    "we also need to develop and promote collaborations with computer scientists and statisticians , who have the necessary skills to develop the next generation data handling tools and techniques that will provide the infrastructure and core functionality of a world of virtual observatories .",
    "the end result of this evolutionary process is that astronomy has now become an information science . with the new capabilities provided by virtual observatories , exciting new scientific avenues can be explored . with the federation of the enormous quantity of multi - wavelength observations , we can discover and study in more detail rare and exotic objects such as high redshift quasars , obscured quasars , extreme broad absorption line quasars , t and l sub - dwarfs , brown dwarfs , and ultra - cool white dwarfs .",
    "the vast quantity of homogeneous survey data will promote the development of new , higher precision studies of the structure of our galaxy and universe , as systematic errors , as opposed to statistical errors , become the limiting factor .",
    "another new possibility would be to harness the available compute power to work directly in the image domain , to perform multi - wavelength source detection and extraction .",
    "we also will be able to correlate diffuse emission across wavelengths to look for structures that more traditional techniques overlook .",
    "finally , perhaps the most exciting scientific possibility is the opening of the time domain , which would not only allow the study of known classes of objects such as gravitational micro - lensing , supernovae , and near - earth asteroids , but also allow for the exploration of a hither - to barely explored area of parameter space .",
    "while the benefits to the scientific community are impressive on their own , virtual observatories can revolutionize how we as a community interact with the public .",
    "astronomy is rather unique in its wide appeal ; by providing broad public access to panchromatic images and simulations of the ever - changing sky , virtual observatories can convey the importance of astronomy , and science in general , to the public and advance overall science literacy .",
    "instructors at all grade levels could interface their curriculum with a virtual observatory , allowing students to participate in a `` hands - on '' manner in the acquisition and analysis of data .",
    "the possibilities truly are limitless .",
    "it is quite obvious that handling and exploring these vast new data volumes , and actually making real scientific discoveries poses a considerable technical challenge .",
    "the traditional astronomical data analysis methods are inadequate to cope with this sudden increase in the data volume ( by several orders of magnitude ) .",
    "fortunately , the existing computing technology can provide such tools , both in hardware and software , but their large - scale implementation in astronomy has not yet happened .    as a result , we expect that the major challenge facing the implementation of virtual observatories is not technological in origin , but sociological .",
    "this is a natural result of the enormous consequences for the astronomical community posed by virtual observatories , which provide for an entirely new way of doing astronomy .",
    "all areas of astronomy will be affected , as people everywhere will suddenly have access to huge quantities of data and the tools necessary to explore it  a process that we call the democratization of astronomy .",
    "we expect that the astronomical community will be very polarized by this concept ; those who embrace the concepts we are promoting , and those who either fear the forthcoming change , or do no think it will ever work . as a result",
    ", we feel that while virtual observatories will be enabled by technology , their development must be driven by science , in order to win broad community support . together with the enormous new opportunities a virtual observatory presents",
    ", science drivers will serve to train the community , and in particular , the next generation of astronomers , to capitalize on the revolution which is sweeping our community .",
    "astronomers have a long history of incorporating new technologies into their research .",
    "eventually , virtual observatory capabilities will become available to the community , and , just as importantly , the general public .",
    "a very successful conference was recently held on the campus of the california institute of technology , which explored the impact virtual observatory technologies would have on our field .",
    "we encourage anyone who is interested to explore the proceedings from that conference ( virtual observatories of the future ) or the conference s web - site .",
    "in addition , an nvo white paper ( nvo white paper 2001 ) was developed by interested personnel within the us astronomical community , which provides more details than could be presented in this conference proceedings .",
    "all correspondence should be directed to the the lead author ( rb@astro.caltech.edu ) .",
    "we are grateful to all of our collaborators from around the world who share our vision .",
    "in addition , we wish to thank nasa and nsf for their encouragement in difficult times , and both sun microsystems and microsoft research for their support .",
    "rjb would like to explicitly acknowledge financial support from nasa grants nag5 - 10885 and nag5 - 9482 ."
