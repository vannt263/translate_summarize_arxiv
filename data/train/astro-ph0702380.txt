    "the relative velocity between protons and alpha particles in the solar wind , @xmath7 , offers important clues for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the solar wind acceleration . in the fast solar wind with proton speeds",
    "@xmath8  @xmath9 , helios measurements made in near - ecliptic regions indicate that there exists a substantial @xmath10 which may be @xmath11  @xmath9  at the heliocentric distance @xmath12  au , amounting to @xmath13 of the local proton speed .",
    "this @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath14 to @xmath15  @xmath9  at 1  au .",
    "furthermore , for a continuous high - latitude fast stream sampled by ulysses between may 1995 and aug 1996 , it was found that the average @xmath0 decreases from @xmath16  @xmath9  at 1.5  au to @xmath17  @xmath9  at 4.2  au @xcite .",
    "as for the slow stream with @xmath18  @xmath9 , @xmath0 tends to be zero on average ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , as clearly shown by figure  11 in @xcite , there seem to be two categories of slow solar winds , in one alpha particles tend to flow faster than protons whereas in the other this tendency is reversed . that @xmath19 therefore reflects the fact that the two kinds of slow winds have nearly equal opportunities to be present .",
    "@xcite interpreted @xmath20 as a consequence of the wave acceleration that favors alpha particles , and @xmath21 as a signature of the solar wind being driven primarily by the electrostatic field since alpha particles experience only half the electric force that protons do .",
    "the former interpretation has been corroborated by an example on day 117 of 1978 , during which period there existed simultaneously strong alfvn wave activities as well as a significant positive @xmath0 at @xmath22  au .",
    "this @xmath0 ( @xmath23  @xmath9 ) is @xmath24% of the measured proton speed @xcite .",
    "helios measurements have also yielded information concerning the angular momentum transport in the solar wind , in particular the distribution of the angular momentum loss @xmath25 between particles @xmath26 and magnetic stresses @xmath5 , and the further partition of @xmath26 between protons @xmath3 and alpha particles @xmath4 @xcite . in spite of the significant scatter , the data nevertheless exhibit a distinct trend for @xmath3 to be positive ( negative ) for solar winds with proton speeds @xmath27 below ( above ) 400  @xmath9 .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath4 is even more difficult , however on average @xmath4 displays a tendency similar to @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic contribution @xmath5 , on the other hand , is remarkably constant . a mean value of @xmath28  @xmath29  can be quoted for the solar winds of all flow speeds and throughout the region from 0.3 to 1  au . for comparison ,",
    "the mean values of angular momentum fluxes carried by ion flows in the slow solar wind are @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xmath32  @xmath29 ( see table ii of @xcite ) .",
    "the fluxes carried by all particles is then @xmath33  @xmath29 , which tends to be larger than @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that , such a value for @xmath26 corresponds to an azimuthal speed of more than 7  @xmath9  for the bulk slow wind , consistent with the measurements made before the helios era ( see the data compiled in section i of @xcite ) .",
    "the aforementioned problems are not isolated from each other . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been shown that in the presence of solar rotation , an additional force appears in the meridional momentum equation of minor ion species .",
    "the effect of this force is to bring the meridional speed of minor ions to that of protons @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that when using the azimuthal speed of minor ions , @xcite were mainly concerned with deriving the so - called `` rotational force '' rather than the angular momentum transport .",
    "hence the azimuthal proton speed was neglected altogether .",
    "@xcite offered a more convenient and more self - consistent derivation of that force by working in the corotating frame , however the azimuthal dynamics was again neglected .",
    "an extension to the study of @xcite has been recently given by @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) who worked in the inertial frame and , in improvement of @xcite , treated the protons and alpha particles on an equal footing .",
    "the resultant model is in effect a three - fluid version of the model of @xcite .",
    "a low - latitude fast solar wind solution was worked out , and it was shown that the solar rotation introduces a barely perceptible difference in the profiles of the meridional ion speeds within 1  au . however , the proton - alpha differential streaming plays a decisive role in determining the azimuthal speeds , and thus the individual angular momentum fluxes , of not only alpha particles but also protons .",
    "li & li s ( 2006 ) model was restricted to the region within 1  au , and gave only one solution for the purpose of presenting a general analysis on the angular momentum transport in a three - fluid solar wind . in this study",
    "we explore , in a quantitative and systematic manner , the interplay between the angular momentum transport and proton - alpha differential streaming in both the slow and fast solar wind for the region extending from the coronal base out to 4.5  au .",
    "it should be noted that so far the only available measurements of the alpha angular momentum flux are from helios which explored the near ecliptic solar wind between 0.3 and 1  au @xcite .",
    "the helios measurements will therefore be compared with the computed ion angular momentum fluxes for the region within 1  au only .",
    "the numerical results for the region outside 1  au will concern only the proton - alpha differential streaming @xmath0 , therefore allowing a comparison of @xmath0 with the ulysses measurements .    before proceeding",
    ", we note that several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed evolution of the proton - alpha differential speed @xmath0 in the fast solar wind beyond 0.3  au .",
    "since they have been critically reviewed in the introduction section of @xcite , some brief remarks are sufficient here .",
    "first , the pondermotive force due to alfvn waves tends to limit @xmath34 , but it operates too slowly to reduce @xmath0 in the observed manner , especially in the region between 0.3 and 1  au .",
    "second , various microinstabilities , in particular the magnetosonic one , are expected to be operational when they have a threshold of @xmath0 of the order of the local alfvn speed . however , these microinstabilities are more likely to be effective in regions beyond 1  au where the parallel proton beta is large . for a more comprehensive review of these kinetic aspects ,",
    "please see @xcite .",
    "third , the compressional waves accompanying large amplitude alfvn waves may help convert the free energy that derives from the differential streaming into alpha heating , thereby reducing @xmath0 @xcite . finally , although intuitively appealing , the coulomb friction proves inefficient for regulating @xmath0 in the majority of the solar wind measured by helios .",
    "it may play some role only for the relatively dense slow wind when @xmath35  @xmath9 ( see figs.13 and 15 in * ? ? ?",
    "the functional dependence on @xmath34 of the coulomb collision frequency between protons and alpha particles , contained in the coefficient @xmath36 in equation  ( [ eq_vkl ] ) , dictates that the friction force will rapidly decrease rather than increase with increasing @xmath34 if @xmath34 exceeds a critical value . except for the coulomb friction , the aforementioned mechanisms are not included in the present study as we try to isolate the effect of solar rotation on the evolution of @xmath0 , since it is an inherent process whose existence is independent of the wave processes .",
    "we further note that the effect of solar rotation has been incorporated in a number of three - fluid solar wind models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in all these papers , the spiral magnetic field is assumed rather than computed , and the azimuthal speeds of ions are neglected .",
    "these models are therefore not suitable for our purpose , i.e. , to examine the angular momentum transport in a three - fluid solar wind .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give a brief overview of the model in section  [ sec_model ] .",
    "some further details on the numerical implementation of the model are given in section  [ sec_nummodel ] . then section  [ sec_numres ] presents the numerical results , which are summarized in section  [ sec_conc ] .",
    "the solar wind model consists of three species , electrons ( @xmath37 ) , protons ( @xmath38 ) , and alpha particles ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "each species @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is characterized by its density @xmath42 , velocity @xmath43 , mass @xmath44 , electric charge @xmath45 , and temperature @xmath46 .",
    "the electric charge is also measured in units of electron charge @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath47 with @xmath48 by definition .",
    "the ion mass number @xmath49 follows from the relation @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . the mass density of species @xmath52 is @xmath53 , and the species partial pressure is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant . from quasi - neutrality",
    "it follows that @xmath56 .",
    "we also assume quasi zero - current , i.e. , @xmath57 , except when the ion momentum equations are derived .",
    "the governing equations , which self - consistently take into account the effect of solar rotation , are identical to those in paper i and will not be given here .",
    "they are appropriate for a time - independent solar wind assuming azimuthal symmetry , i.e. , @xmath58 in a heliocentric spherical coordinate system ( @xmath14 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) . in what follows",
    ", we will describe briefly the model , with the emphasis on the possible effects introduced by the azimuthal components .",
    "in addition , we will also give an analysis of the distribution of the total angular momentum flux between the magnetic field and particles .",
    "it was shown in the appendix of paper i that no mass or energy exchange between different flux tubes is possible , thereby allowing the system of equations to be expressed as a force balance condition across the poloidal magnetic field coupled with the conservation equations along it . in this study ,",
    "the force balance condition is replaced by prescribing a radial ( i.e. , perfectly monopolar ) magnetic field .",
    "the model equations can therefore be solved for the radial distribution of the densities @xmath61 and radial speeds @xmath62 of ion species ( @xmath63 ) , the temperatures @xmath46 of all species ( @xmath64 ) , as well as the azimuthal components of the magnetic field @xmath65 and ion velocities @xmath66 . as such",
    ", the model can be seen as a 1.5-dimensional ( 1.5-d ) one in that the only independent variable is the heliocentric distance @xmath14 , however both the radial and azimuthal components of vectors are retained . to illustrate the effects of solar rotation",
    ", we will also compute models without the @xmath60 components .",
    "for the ease of description these models will be called 1-d ones . furthermore , the ion heat fluxes are neglected , and the field - aligned electron heat flux @xmath67 is assumed to follow the spitzer law , which results in @xmath68 $ ] . here the cross - sectional area of the flux tube @xmath69 scales as @xmath70 , and the magnetic azimuthal angle @xmath71",
    "is defined by @xmath72 . as for the electron conductivity @xmath73 ,",
    "the spitzer value is used , @xmath74 erg  k@xmath75  @xmath76  s@xmath77 @xcite .    from paper",

    "moreover , @xmath83 is the gravitational constant , @xmath84 is the mass of the sun , and @xmath85 stands for the acceleration from some external process .",
    "apart from @xmath86 , the meridional acceleration of the ion flow includes the ion and electron pressure gradient forces ( the terms proportional to @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively ) , the gravitational force , the coulomb friction corrected for the spiral magnetic field , and the force associated with azimuthal flow speeds ( the term in the square parentheses , hereafter referred to as the `` azimuthal force '' for brevity ) . note that the electron pressure gradient force is part of the electrostatic force which is apportioned between two ion species according to their charge - to - mass ratios @xmath89 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "introducing @xmath60 components impacts the meridional dynamics through two means .",
    "first , the electron conductivity is in effect reduced by a factor @xmath90 , thereby affecting the electron temperature and hence the electron pressure gradient force .",
    "second , the azimuthal force enters into the meridional momentum equations .",
    "the two effects can both be important , as will be illustrated by the numerical solutions presented in section [ sec_num_slow ] .      in what follows ,",
    "a simple analysis based on constants of motion for the governing equations shows how the angular momentum loss rate per steradian @xmath25 is distributed between particles @xmath26 and magnetic stresses @xmath5 in a solar wind where different ion species flow with different velocities . as such",
    ", this discussion complements that of @xcite and @xcite where the solar wind is seen as a bulk flow .    following paper i , the expressions for the azimuthal components @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath65 are    [ eq_bvphi ] @xmath93 ,           \\label{eq_vpphi}\\\\ v_{\\alpha\\phi } & = & \\frac{\\omega r\\sin\\theta}{m_t^2 - 1 }     \\left [        \\overbrace{m_t^2\\frac{r_a^2}{r^2}-1}^{\\mbox{i } }       + \\overbrace{m_p^2\\frac{v_{\\alpha p , r}}{v_{p r } }           \\left(\\frac{r_a^2}{r^2}-1\\right)}^{\\mbox{ii } }     \\right ] ,           \\label{eq_viphi}\\\\ b_{\\phi } & = & \\omega r\\sin\\theta\\frac{4\\pi\\rho_p v_{p r } ( 1+\\zeta)}{b_r }     \\frac{r_a^2/r^2 - 1}{m_t^2 - 1 } ,            \\label{eq_bphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which @xmath94 is the radial component of the velocity difference vector @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the angular rotation rate of the flux tube , and the constant @xmath97 denotes the ion mass flux ratio .",
    "the terms designated by ii are associated with the differential streaming , whereas the terms denoted by i take care of the rest .",
    "the subscript @xmath98 denotes the alfvnic point where @xmath99 , @xmath100 being the combined meridional alfvnic mach number defined by @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the field and particle contributions to the angular momentum loss rate per steradian @xmath25 are @xmath103 where @xmath51 . from equation  ( [ eq_bvphi ] ) follows that @xmath104 in which @xmath105 is the total mass loss rate of the solar wind .",
    "the ratio @xmath106 is rather complex and had better be examined case by case due to the presence of terms labeled ii in equations  ( [ eq_vpphi ] ) and ( [ eq_viphi ] ) .",
    "note that terms ii derive essentially from the requirement that the proton - alpha velocity difference vector be aligned with the instantaneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal speeds are expected to be determined by these terms when there exists a substantial @xmath94 , which is almost exclusively determined by the way in which the external energy is distributed among different species in the corona . as shown in section  [ sec_numres ] , such a situation happens for the majority of the numerical solutions in interplanetary space . hence the azimuthal speeds and the resultant specific angular momenta of ion species measured _ in situ _",
    "are essentially determined by the processes that happen in the corona .",
    "furthermore , it follows from the identity @xmath107 that terms ii have no contribution to the overall angular momentum loss rate . as a result",
    ", a concise result can be found for the ratio of the overall particle contribution @xmath6 to the magnetic one @xmath5 . by defining the bulk velocity @xmath108",
    "one can see @xmath109 . as a result",
    ", @xmath110 it is interesting to see that only one single speed @xmath111 enters into the ratio @xmath112 .    in comparison with @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the expressions here indicate that , a proper definition of the alfvnic point is through @xmath99 , and the bulk flow velocity @xmath113 should be defined as an average between the proton and alpha velocities , weighted by their respective mass fluxes ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq_def_bulku ] ) ) .",
    "of course these differences only matter when the abundance of alpha particles and the differential streaming between the protons and alpha particles are large . when @xmath114 or @xmath115 , the results are identical to those in @xcite .",
    "the model has been briefly described in the preceding section where a rather general analysis is also given .",
    "however , it is still necessary to solve the governing equations numerically for a quantitative analysis to be made . in particular , some external heating and/or momentum addition need to be applied to the ions to generate a solar wind solution .",
    "the implementation of the energy deposition and a description of the method of solution are given in this section .",
    "the external energy deposition is assumed to come from an _ ad hoc _ energy flux which dissipates at a constant length @xmath116 .",

    "the energy is deposited in protons entirely as heat @xmath123 , but deposited in the alpha gas in the form of both heating @xmath124 and acceleration @xmath125 . to be more specific ,",
    "@xmath126 is apportioned among @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the following way ,    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is some characteristic speed .",
    "the choice of the heat and momentum deposition needs some explanation .",
    "the exponential form of @xmath126 was first suggested by @xcite and was later employed in a large number of studies .",
    "the form of @xmath126 adopted here is slightly different from the original version to ensure that it mimics the dissipation of a flux of non - thermal energy , for instance , the dissipation of low - frequency alfvn waves .",
    "this may happen as a result of a turbulent cascade towards high parallel wavenumbers where the wave energy is picked up by ions through the ion - cyclotron resonance .",
    "( for more details , please see the review by @xcite dedicated to this topic . )",
    "once @xmath126 is specified , the way it is distributed among different ion species , characterized by the parameter @xmath129 , depends on the resonant interaction between cyclotron waves and ions .",
    "note that @xmath129 indicates how alpha particles are favored when @xmath126 is distributed , with @xmath130 standing for the neutral heating : the total energy that goes to ion species @xmath78 is proportional to its mass density @xmath131 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "previous computations involving ion cyclotron waves indicate that , in the case of neutral heating , the alpha particles tend to flow slower than protons ( see the dispersionless case in fig.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . only when the alphas are energetically favored in the corona can the modeled @xmath0 be positive in interplanetary space .",
    "this happens when @xmath132 .",

    "the radial components of ion velocities , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , are specified to ensure mass conservation . on the other hand , @xmath138 and @xmath65",

    "as has been described in the introduction , we are interested in answering two questions : 1 ) to what extent is @xmath0 , the differential streaming between protons and alpha particles , affected by introducing solar rotation ? and 2 ) is it possible to reconcile the model results with the helios measurements , as far as the specific angular momentum fluxes are concerned ? in this section , we will first examine the fast solar wind and then move on to the slow one .",
    "given in figure  [ fig_cpfast ] is a comparison of the 1.5-d ( solid curves ) with the 1-d model ( dotted curves ) of the fast solar wind solution in the equatorial plane ( colatitude @xmath142 ) .",

    ", the dash - dotted line shows the parameter @xmath143 , which also takes into account the azimuthal component of the difference vector .",
    "the asterisk denotes the alfvnic point in the 1.5-d model , which lies at @xmath144 . for comparison ,",
    "the open boxes give the near - ecliptic helios measurements of @xmath0 for the fast wind as reported by @xcite .    from figs.[fig_cpfast]a and [ fig_cpfast]b",
    ", one can see that introducing the solar rotation only affects the solar wind beyond say 50  @xmath122 .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the ion fluxes are unchanged in the 1.5-d model , as compared with the 1-d one .",
    "both models yield an ion flux ratio of @xmath145 , and a proton flux of @xmath146  @xmath147 s@xmath77 when scaled to 1  au .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fig_cpfast]a that , although @xmath94 decreases with radial distance @xmath14 for both the 1-d and 1.5-d models beyond their mutual maximum of @xmath148  @xmath9  attained at 9.4  @xmath122 , the reduction in @xmath94 is more prominent in the 1.5-d model from 0.3 to 4  au .",
    "the reduction in @xmath0 for the 1.5-d model , when compared with the 1-d one , is also substantial , although less significant than the reduction in @xmath94 due to the presence of the azimuthal component of @xmath95 .",
    "nevertheless the 1.5-d model yields a @xmath149 of 11.4  @xmath9  at 4  au , as opposed to 29.3  @xmath9  attained in the 1-d model . from fig.[fig_cpfast]b",
    "one can see that the reduction in @xmath94 in the 1.5-d model is achieved by lowering the radial speed profile of alpha particles @xmath137 and raising that of protons @xmath136 .",
    "this effect is barely perceptible at 0.3  au but becomes more obvious with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig_cpfast]a indicates that the modeled @xmath0 profile deviates significantly from the helios measurements , especially in the region closer to the sun . in other words , the deceleration of alpha particles relative to protons as measured by helios can not be explained by merely invoking the @xmath60 components .",
    "however can this mechanism be entirely ruled out as far as the ulysses measurements are concerned ?",
    "such a possibility is examined in figure  [ fig_cpuly ] . in fig.[fig_cpuly]a , the distribution of @xmath0 in the @xmath150 plane for the region extending from 1 to 4.2  au",
    "is displayed as contours equally spaced by 1  @xmath9 .",
    "the solutions are obtained by varying the colatitude @xmath59 alone . recalling that by assumption the solar wind flows in a perfectly monopolar magnetic field",
    ", one may see that the latitudinal dependence is entirely due to solar rotation . from fig.[fig_cpuly]a",
    "it is obvious that in the regions close to the pole , say @xmath151 , @xmath0 shows little radial dependence .",
    "however with increasing @xmath59 , the radial gradient in @xmath0 becomes increasingly significant .    in fig.[fig_cpuly]b ,",
    "the solid curve represents the modeled @xmath0 profile along the ulysses trajectory delineated by the dashed curve in fig.[fig_cpuly]a in the interval between 1995 may 05 and 1996 aug 02 . during this period , ulysses sampled a continuous , undisturbed , high speed stream above the latitude of @xmath152n in the radial range of @xmath153  au .",
    "the actual ulysses measurements are given by the error bars which correspond to the 25 - 75% percentiles of the @xmath0 distribution over 10-day bins @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that , for @xmath154  au , @xmath0 in the numerical solutions increases as opposed to the observed tendency for @xmath0 to decrease .",
    "this is because during this period , ulysses was moving towards the pole and the effect of solar rotation diminishes with decreasing @xmath59 .",
    "however , for @xmath155  au , the decrease in @xmath0 from 30.7  @xmath9 at 2  au to 12.4  @xmath9  at 4.2  au is consistent with the observed values within the accuracy of the measurements . from this",
    "we conclude that solar rotation should not be neglected in attempts to understand the ulysses measurements of @xmath0 beyond 2  au .",
    "it is necessary to stress that this conclusion should not be confused with that reached by @xcite who demonstrated by showing a profile designated `` ulysses rotational deceleration '' in their figure  8 that the @xmath0 profile measured by ulysses has little to do with the rotational deceleration .",
    "in fact , we agree with these authors that introducing solar rotation can not provide a unified mechanism to account for the observed deceleration of @xmath0 from 0.3  au onwards .",
    "what fig.[fig_cpuly]b shows is that , if a reasonable @xmath0 is given at 2  au , the solar rotation alone can decelerate the alpha particles relative to protons in the observed fashion .",
    "we now turn to the problem of the angular momentum transport in the fast solar wind along @xmath142 .",
    "figure  [ fig_azi_spec ] describes the radial distribution of ( a ) the azimuthal ion speeds @xmath138 and @xmath156 , and ( b ) the specific angular momentum fluxes including those carried by protons @xmath3 , alpha particles @xmath157 and magnetic stresses @xmath5 .",
    "the total angular momentum flux @xmath25 should be a constant , as is indeed the case in the numerical solution . to isolate the contribution of the differential streaming to individual azimuthal speeds , term i ( ii ) in eqs.([eq_vpphi ] ) and ( [ eq_viphi ] ) is plotted as the dashed ( dash - dotted ) curve between 0.3 and 4  au . in fig.[fig_azi_spec]b ,",
    "the dashed line is used for plotting negative values .",
    "the asterisks in both panels mark the alfvnic point @xmath158 .    from fig.[fig_azi_spec]a",
    "one can see that with the development of @xmath159 , some substantial difference arises between @xmath138 and @xmath156 . to be more specific , @xmath91 increases from the coronal base to 5.84  @xmath9  at 6.9  @xmath122 ,",
    "beyond which @xmath91 decreases gradually to @xmath160  @xmath9  around 4  au .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath92 reaches a local maximum of 4.3  @xmath9 at 2.88  @xmath122 .",
    "rather than partially corotate with the sun , alpha particles then gradually develop an azimuthal velocity in the direction of counter - rotation with the sun : @xmath156 is negative beyond 11.7  @xmath122 .",

    "furthermore , introducing the @xmath60 components reduces the proton - alpha differential speed by decelerating the alphas and accelerating the protons .",
    "take the radial speeds at 1  au for instance .",

    ", one may expect that @xmath0 is largely determined by the proportion of the external energy deposited to alpha particles , characterized by the parameter @xmath129 .",

    "when comparing the thin and thick solid lines , one can see that the profile of @xmath0 for 1-d models differs only slightly from that for 1.5-d ones .",
    "going from 0.3 to 4  au , the magnitude of @xmath0 is significantly reduced by introducing the azimuthal components .",
    "unsurprisingly this effect is more prominent at the high and low ends .",
    "for instance the 1-d model for @xmath202 yields @xmath203  @xmath9  at 4  au , whereas the corresponding 1.5-d model gives @xmath204",
    "it turns out that introducing the @xmath60 components reduces @xmath0 via different mechanisms for different portions of this parameter range .",
    "for @xmath129 between 1.0 and 2.3 , the proton - alpha friction eventually becomes operative between 0.3 and 4  au to suppress any significant @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", no obvious deviation shows up between 1-d and 1.5-d models . if @xmath205 , the reduction of @xmath34 in the 1.5-d model is achieved partly by the enhanced electron pressure gradient force ( which stems from the enhanced electron temperature due to reduced effective electron thermal conductivity in presence of the spiral field ) and more importantly via the azimuthal force . on the other hand , for @xmath206 ,",
    "the reduction in @xmath34 is solely due to the azimuthal force , since in this case , the electron pressure gradient force tends to increase the magnitude of @xmath0 as a consequence of the smaller charge - to - mass ratio of alpha particles compared with that of protons .",
    "figure  [ fig_azi_par ] displays the distribution with @xmath129 of the values at 1  au of ( a ) the azimuthal speeds of ions @xmath138 and @xmath92 , and ( b ) specific angular momentum fluxes including that carried by protons @xmath3 , alpha particles @xmath4 , as well as by magnetic stresses @xmath5 . from fig.[fig_azi_par]a",
    "one can see that @xmath138 and @xmath156 at 1  au tend to have opposite signs , an evidence that they are mainly determined by the terms associated with @xmath94 in eqs.([eq_vpphi ] ) and ( [ eq_viphi ] ) . as a matter of fact , for all @xmath129 but @xmath207 , term ii in equation  ( [ eq_viphi ] ) contributes more than term i to @xmath92 . as to @xmath138 , with the exception of @xmath208 , the main contribution also comes from term ii in equation  ( [ eq_vpphi ] )",
    ". looking at fig.[fig_vap_par ] , one finds that for this narrow range of @xmath129 , @xmath0 at 1  au ranges from -3 to 1.1  @xmath9 . at substantial relative speeds between protons and alpha particles",

    "is -4.1 ( 59.3 )  @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , from fig.[fig_azi_par]b one can see that @xmath5 or @xmath25 varies little , although @xmath3 and @xmath4 vary significantly within the parameter range as a consequence of the sensitive dependence of @xmath156 and @xmath138 on @xmath129 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath129 varies from @xmath196 to @xmath197 , @xmath25 shows only a slight increase from 3.39 to 3.86 @xmath32  @xmath29 , and @xmath5 increases from 3.09 to 3.51 @xmath32  @xmath29 .",
    "the increase of @xmath25 with @xmath129 can be explained by equation  ( [ eq_call ] ) . for the solutions considered",
    ", the location of the alfvnic point varies little .",
    "however , the mass loss rate , which is mainly determined by the proton flux , increases with increasing @xmath129 as a consequence of more energy being deposited to the subsonic portion for the proton gas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath212 shows little variation with @xmath129 .",
    "this can be seen as an indication that the ratio of the bulk speed @xmath111 attained asymptotically to that at the alfvnic point is rather insensitive to @xmath129 , since @xmath213 in the region @xmath172 ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq_distril2 ] ) ) . moreover , if @xmath111 varies little beyond @xmath158 , as is the case for all the obtained slow wind solutions , @xmath212 should be only slightly larger than unity for @xmath214 .",
    "the expectation is reproduced by fig.[fig_azi_par]b from which one can see that magnetic stresses are always the most important term in @xmath25 , despite the fact that individual angular momentum fluxes carried by ion species , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , can be much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "now the model results can be compared with the helios measurements for specific angular momentum fluxes @xcite .",
    "one can see that , although @xmath5 falls within the uncertainties of the measurements , and values like 1.3@xmath32  @xmath29  can be found for @xmath4 at @xmath215 , no values as large as 19.6@xmath32  @xmath29 can be found for @xmath3 unless the alpha particles are heated even more intensely .",
    "moreover , fig.[fig_azi_par]b does not reproduce the observed tendency for the particle contribution @xmath26 to be larger than the magnetic one @xmath5 at 1  au . as has been discussed",
    ", the reason is that the solar wind bulk flow @xmath111 experiences little acceleration outside the alfvnic point @xmath158 .",
    "it is unlikely that this feature can be changed by simply varying other model parameters .",
    "actually the discrepancy between model predictions and measurements on the relative importance of @xmath26 and @xmath5 is common to all existing models that treat the meridional and azimuthal dynamics self - consistently ( cf .",
    "sections i and vii of @xcite ) . to examine the possible sources leading to this discrepancy , in what follows we consider some of the physics that is not accounted for in the present model .    in the framework of steady state models ,",
    "the fast and slow magnetosonic waves , in the wkb approximation , have non - zero @xmath216 components in their stress tensors , thereby also contributing to the angular momentum loss of the solar wind @xcite . on the one hand , this contribution may be comparable to that due to the background flow and magnetic field stress when the waves have sufficiently large amplitudes . on the other hand , depending on the propagation angle with respect to the background magnetic field , the particle part may dominate the magnetic one in the wave contribution .",
    "( this can be seen if one evaluates the @xmath216 component of eq.(7 ) by using , e.g. , the fast wave eigen - function eq.(10 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , including compressional waves may provide a possible means to resolve the apparent discrepancy .",
    "furthermore , extending the wkb analysis to higher order , @xcite found that alfvn waves with finite wavelength may carry a non - vanishing flux of angular momentum , but the contribution seems to worsen rather than improve the discrepancy .",
    "finally , we refer the reader to the discussion of @xcite , whose 2.5-d model also incorporates the momentum deposition by alfvn waves . instead of attributing this discrepancy to mechanisms missing in the steady state model",
    ", @xcite proposed that the tendency for @xmath26 to be larger than @xmath5 is due to interplanetary dynamical processes such as the forward fast shocks traversing the solar wind .",
    "their discussion also applies to the present model , although the details of the response of the three - fluid plasma to fast shocks need to be explored .",
    "the near - ecliptic measurements of the fast solar wind by helios demonstrated the existence of a significant proton - alpha differential speed , @xmath0 , varying from 150  @xmath9  at 0.3 au to 30 - 40  @xmath9  at 1 au@xcite . a steady decrease of @xmath0 between 1.5 and 4 au was also measured by ulysses out of the ecliptic plane @xcite .",
    "the helios measurements also indicated the existence of two categories of slow solar wind . in one category ,",
    "the alpha particles tended to be slower than the protons , whereas the opposite trend was found in the other category@xcite .",
    "the measurements also yielded information about the angular momentum transport , in particular , the specific angular momentum fluxes in the magnetic stress @xmath5 , and in the two major ion species @xmath3 and @xmath4@xcite .    in an attempt to account for these observations",
    ", we introduced solar rotation self - consistently in a three - fluid solar wind model .",
    "the impetus for this approach was inspired by the fact that the solar rotation is an inherent process , independent of different mechanisms invoked for accelerating the solar wind . by exploring the resulting interplay between @xmath0 and the angular momentum transport we reached the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the force introduced in the radial momentum equations by the azimuthal components can play a significant role in the force balance in interplanetary space .",
    "its main effect is to reduce the difference between the ion flow speeds .",
    "2 .   while the effect of solar rotation could not account for the decrease in @xmath0 in the fast solar wind from 0.3 to 1  au , it could account for the @xmath0 profile measured by ulysses beyond 2  au if an appropriate value for @xmath0 was chosen at 2  au .",
    "3 .   the effect of solar rotation was found to be more pronounced for the slow solar wind if a significant @xmath0 developed by 0.3 au , resulting in a relative change of 10 - 16% in the radial speed of the alpha particles between 1 and 4 au .",
    "4 .   for the slow solar wind solutions considered ,",
    "the angular momentum flux carried by alpha particles , @xmath4 , at 1 au , was almost exclusively determined by @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 was also determined by @xmath0 for @xmath217 or @xmath218  @xmath9 .",
    "5 .   in the fast solar wind , @xmath3 and @xmath4 beyond 0.3  au",
    "are also mainly due to @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that even though alpha particles take up only a small fraction of the energy and linear momentum fluxes of protons , they can not be neglected when the proton angular momentum flux is concerned , i.e. @xmath3 can not be studied by simply incorporating the azimuthal components into models of an electron - proton solar wind .",
    "6 .   for the slow solar wind",
    ", @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be several times larger in magnitude than the flux carried by the magnetic stresses @xmath5 .",
    "however , the total particle distribution @xmath219 is always smaller than @xmath5 for all solutions . while this tendency is inherent to the present model",
    ", it is at variance with the helios measurements .    in closing , some words of caution seem in order . as has been discussed , a pure fluid model of a quiet solar wind as adopted in this study is rather idealized . in reality",
    ", the solar wind will be subject to various disturbances such as compressional magnetosonic waves , shock waves , and other processes resulting from stream - stream interactions .",
    "these disturbances may significantly modify the distribution of the angular momentum flux between particles and magnetic field stresses , and may alter the overall angular momentum loss rate of the solar wind . with increasing distance , such as in the outer heliosphere , these disturbances are expected to become increasingly important . with this caveat in mind , the presented study nevertheless provides a better understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "even when the above - mentioned dynamical processes are taken into account , one would expect to see that solar rotation has significant effects on the alpha flow speeds in interplanetary space , and in turn , alpha particles are important in the problem of angular momentum transport of the solar wind ."
