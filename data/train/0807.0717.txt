    "carbon giant stars are though to arise from the third dredge up of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which pollutes the envelope and atmosphere with nuclear processed material from the interior .",
    "this increases the abundance of carbon and the @xmath0c/@xmath2c ratio to well above the terrestrial level ( 0.011 ) .",
    "in fact the @xmath0c/@xmath2c ratio in carbon giants has been measured to be as high as one - third @xcite .",
    "there are a number line lists or opacity functions available for h@xmath2cn@xcite . however , when considering the contribution to opacity by molecular species such as hcn it may not be sufficient to account only for h@xmath2cn , but also for the isotopologue h@xmath0cn .",
    "the calculation of a complete triatomic linelist is computationally expensive , requiring several tens of thousands of cpu hours @xcite .",
    "however , within the born - oppenheimer approximation the electronic structure of isotopologues is identical .",
    "thus both the potential energy and electric dipole moment functions are identical for all isotopologues .",
    "this implies that the vibration - rotation frequencies and transition intensities are likely to be very similar .    for a hetronuclear molecule , such as hcn ,",
    "the main differences between the spectra of isotopologues are caused by the change in reduced mass . in the harmonic approximation",
    "the vibrational contribution to the line frequency is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the reduced mass .",
    "so the frequency of the cn stretch vibrational mode of h@xmath2cn  and h@xmath0cn  will differ by the order of 1% and the bend and h - c stretch mode by less . in terms of both",
    "the observation of h@xmath0cn  and the line blanketing of a model atmosphere this shift in line frequency is more important than the small differences in line intensity between comparable lines of h@xmath2cnand h@xmath0cn .",
    "it is the aim of this work to compute a set of energy levels and line frequencies for h@xmath0cn  and hn@xmath0c .",
    "these energy levels will be used in conjunction with the einstein a coefficients for h@xmath2cn  and hn@xmath2ccomputed by @xcite , to generate a h@xmath0cn / hn@xmath0c  linelist .",
    "the line frequencies in this h@xmath0cn / hn@xmath0c  linelist have been corrected using available laboratory data in order to increase its accuracy .",
    "the new linelist has been used to compute synthetic spectra for c - stars , with different @xmath0c/@xmath2c ratios using star wz cas as a prototype .",
    "using the existing hcn / hnc potential energy surface of @xcite a set of _ ab initio _ rotation - vibration energy levels for h@xmath0cn  and hn@xmath0c  were calculated for angular momenta of @xmath5 = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 and for both even ( @xmath6 ) and odd ( @xmath7 ) parity .",
    "the states were computed up to an energy of at least @xmath8  @xmath9  above the h@xmath0cn  ground state , where @xmath10  @xmath9  is the hcn rotational constant .",
    "the dvr3d suite of codes @xcite was used for all these calculations .",
    "dvr3d uses an exact kinetic energy operator and discrete variable representation for the nuclear motion wavefunctions .",
    "we have used the initial basis set functions and parameters used by @xcite for the computation of an extensive h@xmath2cn / hn@xmath2c   linelist .",
    "the basis functions are legendre polynomials for the angular grid points and morse oscillator - like functions for the radial grids .",
    "jacobi coordinates were used , with 50 grid points for the angular coordinate , 35 grid points for the first ( @xmath11 ) radial coordinate , 21 for the second ( @xmath12 ) radial coordinate . where @xmath12 is the distance from c to n nuclei and @xmath11 the distance from the h nucleus to the centre of mass of the c - n diatom .",
    "the parameters for the morse oscillator like basis functions in the r coordinate are @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath16 and @xmath18 @xmath14 , @xmath19 @xmath16 and @xmath20 @xmath16 for the r coordinate . where @xmath21 is the equilibrium distance",
    ", @xmath22 is the dissociation energy and @xmath23 is the harmonic frequency .",
    "only the exact quantum numbers for a hetronuclear triatomic , angular momentum ( @xmath5 ) and parity are known for each state computed by dvr3d . to determine the rotational constants for each vibrational state it is first necessary to assign approximate vibrational quantum numbers to each rotation - vibration state .",
    "the approximate vibrational quantum numbers are c - h stretch ( @xmath24 ) , bend ( @xmath25 ) , c - n stretch ( @xmath26 ) , vibrational angular momentum ( @xmath27 ) and isomer ( h@xmath0cn  or hn@xmath0c ) . where @xmath27 take values in steps of 2 from 0 or 1 , if @xmath25 is even or odd respectively , up to the lower of @xmath25 or @xmath5 .",
    "so for a state with @xmath28 and @xmath29 then @xmath27 can take values of 1,3,5 , but if @xmath30 or @xmath31 then @xmath27 can only take values of 1 or 3 .",
    "the quantum number assignments were made using a method similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "initially quantum numbers were assigned to the h@xmath0cn  @xmath32 purely vibrational states up to 10  000 @xmath9  above the zero point energy .",
    "the first states to be assigned were the lowest lying states of each of the 3 h@xmath0cn  fundamental modes .",
    "the vibrational expansion eq .",
    "[ eq : vibexp ] was then least squares fit to the assigned states , which provided values for the fundamental frequencies @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34    the fundamental frequencies allow estimates for the energy of more highly excited states to be made , which aid further assignments . next , eq .  [ eq : vibexp ] was least squares fit to the newly assigned states so that the higher order vibrational constants @xmath35 could also be determined .",
    "this process was repeated until all @xmath32 h@xmath0cn  states up to 10  000  @xmath9  were assigned .",
    "the @xmath5=0 hn@xmath0c  states were fit separately from the h@xmath0cn  states , but the assignments made simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath36 @xmath6 and@xmath7 states were assigned by comparison with the @xmath32 states and by fitting equation [ eq : vibexp ] to verify the assignments .    in order to aid the assignments of states with @xmath37 we have least squares fit the assigned levels for each vibrational state and each parity with : @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\         &    & -d_v[j(j+1)+l^2]^2 + ...   \\label{eq : rotexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the vibrational energy of the band , @xmath40 is the rotational constant and @xmath41 is the centrifugal distortion constant .",
    "this allows energies for the states with the next highest @xmath5 to be estimated and assigned . for further verification these assigned states",
    "were then fitted with the vibrational expansion .",
    "this process was carried out on an increasing @xmath5 by @xmath5 basis until all the computed energy levels up to @xmath42 had been assigned .",
    "once the assignments were completed , a final fit of the rotational expansion was performed for each vibrational state and parity .",
    "a total of 390 vibrational states of h@xmath0cn / hn@xmath0c  have been studied all with a vibrational energy ( @xmath39 ) less than 10  000  @xmath9 . using this final set of rotational constants a set of calculated rotation - vibration energy levels for h@xmath0cn  and hn@xmath0c",
    "was computed for all values of @xmath5 up to 60 .    at stellar temperatures transitions between levels with lower state energy",
    "over 10  000  @xmath9  do contribute significantly to opacity .",
    "these lines tend to be weak and numerous so that they form an almost continuous opacity source . in order to account for these high temperature weak lines",
    "we have supplemented the h@xmath0cn / hn@xmath0c  energy level list with high energy h@xmath2cn",
    "/ hn@xmath2c energy levels .",
    "line frequencies determined in the laboratory are significantly more accurate than than purely _ ab initio _ data . therefore , where possible we have incorporated laboratory determined energy levels into our linelist .",
    "h@xmath0cn  has been well studied in the laboratory @xcite , but hn@xmath0c  has been studied to a far lesser extent @xcite .",
    "hn@xmath0c  laboratory determined energy levels have therefore not been incorporated in to the linelist .",
    "@xcite have provided an electronic database of h@xmath0cn   line frequencies , from this we have compiled a list of h@xmath0cn  laboratory determined energy levels , in the same way as @xcite .",
    "many line frequencies of the studied bands remain unmeasured , there are therefore missing energy levels for many of the vibrational states .",
    "these missing energy levels were interpolated by means of the rotational expansion to give a complete list list of energy levels in @xmath5 for each band up to the maximum @xmath5 measured by @xcite .",
    "as the rotational expansion is divergent , it can not be reliably used to extrapolate the laboratory determined energy levels beyond the maximum @xmath5 measured by @xcite . to extend the laboratory determined energy level list to @xmath42 , the maximum extent of the @xcite linelist",
    ", we have used a correction to the _ ab inito _ energy levels described in [ sec : rotcon ] .",
    "this constant is given by : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the energy of the state in the laboratory energy level list with the highest angular momentum ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 , is the energy of the _ ab initio _  energy level with @xmath47 .",
    "this lab / empirical energy level list contains 4425 energy levels , which have been incorporated into the calculated list of h@xmath0cn / hn@xmath0c  energy levels described in section [ sec : rotcon ] .",

    "there is very good agreement between line frequencies and good agreement between line intensities . for the @xmath48 overtone our intensities",
    "are around 20% stronger than those from hitran , the agreement between intensities is better for the @xmath26 fundamental .",
    "figures [ fig : opacv2v3 ] , [ fig : opacv1v2 ] and [ fig : opacv2 ] show the opacity of h@xmath0cn , determined in this work , compared to that of h@xmath2cn  computed by @xcite at a temperature of 3000  k. the opacity has been calculated by convolving the individual lines with gaussians of half - width at half - maximum of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the wavenumber of the line , this gives a resolution comparable to that achieved with the sws spectrometer on the iso satellite .",
    "the bands shown in these figures all show strong q - branches , which makes the identification of some bands possible at high temperature and low resolution .",
    "the identification of absorption by h@xmath0cn  from the @xmath51 bands is likely to be made difficult by the strong background of h@xmath2cn .",
    "however , the @xmath25 and @xmath52 bands look to be more promising candidate for identification in a c - star .",
    "this is because the opacity of h@xmath0cn  at the peak of the q - branches of these bands is up to 70% stronger than the h@xmath2cn  opacity , making them more easily identifiable against a strong background of h@xmath2cn  absorption .",
    "synthetic spectra for the carbon star wz  cas were calculated with the wita6 program @xcite .",
    "in addition to the same approximations , opacities and input parameters as in our earlier calculations @xcite , we have also included our new h@xmath0cn / hn@xmath0c   opacity .",
    "these synthetic spectra are calculated using the best fit model atmosphere for wz  cas from @xcite , which has t@xmath53@xmath54 2800  k , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "synthetic spectra computed with h@xmath0cn / h@xmath2cn   ratios of 0 , 1/4 and 1 compared to the iso / sws observed spectrum of wz  cas @xcite are shown in figure [ fig : wzcas ] .",
    "the effect of h@xmath0cn   absorption can be seen in the synthetic spectra with h@xmath0cn / h@xmath2cn  ratios of 1/4 and 1 , however below a ratio of 1/4 it becomes difficult to identify h@xmath0cn  absorption on the strong background of h@xmath2cn  lines .",
    "although , the strength of the some of the h@xmath0cn  features in the theoretical spectrum indicates a useful @xmath2c/@xmath0c ratio maybe measured around 3.62 and 3.64 @xmath1 m there remain other unidentified opacities in this region , e.g. , the strong observed bandhead at 3.63 @xmath1 m .    another interesting spectral region to study hcn features we find around 14 @xmath1 m ( see @xcite ) for more details .",
    "the predominant features in this region are the q branches of the and ( @xmath57 ) bands .",
    "computed spectra for the 2800/0.0 model atmosphere given by @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:_30 ] . to simplify presentation of our results",
    "only a short spectral range is shown here . as we see from the comparison of computed spectra with and without a contribution from hn@xmath0c  they differ significantly , at least at 14.05 , 14.11 , 14.23 @xmath1 m , where the strong features created by h@xmath0cn  bands are located .",
    "this region can be considered as very promising for the future investigations of the carbon isotopic ratios in atmospheres of carbon stars .",
    "we have searched the iso archive for suitable high resolution data .",
    "the available data in the 14 @xmath1 m regime for potentially suitable targets iras 15194 - 5115 , ry dra , t lyr , wz casa , y cvn covers a relatively large parameter space of stellar properties with high @xmath2c/@xmath0c ratio although none of the available spectra offer a combination of resolution , signal - to - noise and other features which we understood well enough to allow us to convincingly identify h@xmath0cn  or hn@xmath0c   features . such analysis will have to await both better spectra and a better characterisation of the other absorbing species in the same wavelength region .",
    "we present a new set of _ ab initio _ rotation - vibration energy levels for h@xmath0cn  and hn@xmath0c   which were calculated for angular momenta of @xmath5 = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 and for both even ( @xmath6 ) and odd ( @xmath7 ) parity .",
    "the states were computed up to an energy of at least @xmath58  @xmath9   above the h@xmath0cn  ground state , where @xmath10  @xmath9  is the hcn rotational constant .",
    "the quantum number assignments were made using a method similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the new linelist has been incorporated into our computations of c - rich synthetic spectra .",
    "the detailed analysis of the infrared spectra of c - giant star with high @xmath0c/@xmath2c ratios ought to take account of h@xmath0cn  and hn@xmath0c  species .",
    "moreover in many cases hcn spectra probably provides the best chance of determining the @xmath0c/@xmath2c ratios in atmospheres of the coolest stars as the co bands at 2.3 @xmath1 m are usually saturated and other molecular bands are severely blended .",
    "our upgraded opacity sources can be used for the determination of carbon isotopic ratios in atmospheres of carbon stars .",
    "the most promising regions are those around 3.6 and 14 @xmath1 m where the the @xmath52 ( bend and cn stretch ) combination bands and @xmath25 ( bend ) fundamental and hot bands of h@xmath2cn   and h@xmath0cn  molecules are located , respectively .",
    "however , to do this requires to use the spectral data of the proper quality .",
    "finally , the use of h@xmath2cn  and h@xmath0cn  lines for numerical analysis of infrared spectra of evolved stars is restricted by the incompleteness of presently available opacity sets , see @xcite .",
    "special attention needs be paid to the computation of other lines for polyatomic molecules such as c@xmath59 , nh@xmath59 , ch@xmath60 and c@xmath61h@xmath61 , and their isotopologues .",
