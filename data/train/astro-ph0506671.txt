    "understanding the physical and chemical structure of the inner hundred au of the envelopes around protostellar objects is important because part of this material will be included in circumstellar disks from which planets may form eventually .",
    "the innermost envelopes are characterized by high temperatures ( @xmath6  100  k ) and densities ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ) , making them eminently suited for observations at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "these regions are , however , heavily diluted in single - dish beams ( @xmath13 size compared to typical single - dish beam sizes of 1020@xmath1 ) and interpretation of their line and continuum emission relies on extrapolation of the density and temperature distribution from observations on larger scales .",
    "furthermore , studies based on observations of lower excitation lines are complicated by the fact that a large fraction of their emission may arise in the outer cold regions of the envelopes , where the lines can also become optically thick .",
    "interferometry with the submillimeter array ( sma ) avoids most of these complications and thus provides a unique possibility to probe the warm and dense material in the innermost regions of protostellar systems . in this paper",
    "we present sma observations for the low - mass protostar ngc  1333-iras2a .",
    "this study will serve as an illustration of the type of data and analysis techniques that are possible for these objects and will be applied in the future to a much larger sample of low - mass protostars currently being observed at the sma .",
    "the first goal of this project is to constrain the physical structure on scales of a few hundred au from the continuum data .",
    "the larger ( @xmath14 au ) scale temperature and density distribution is well determined from analysis of single - dish submillimeter continuum images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but holes , cavities and departures from spherical symmetry are likely at smaller radii . in addition , any disk will start to contribute significantly to the emission on scales of a few hundred au .",
    "since the dust continuum flux scales with frequency as @xmath15 or steeper , submillimeter interferometry is particularly well suited to probe the disks and distinguish them from the envelope .",
    "very little is known about the physical properties such as mass and sizes of disks in these deeply embedded stages , parameters which the sma data can constrain .",
    "a second goal of this project is to study the chemistry in the innermost region , where large changes in abundances are expected due to evaporation of icy grain mantles that inject species such as h@xmath4o and ch@xmath2oh into the gas - phase .",
    "reactions between evaporated molecules result in a distinct `` hot core chemistry '' containing even more complex organic molecules . in recent years",
    "the existence of such hot cores has been suggested in a number of low - mass young stellar objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the paper is laid out as follows :  2 describes the details of the observations and  3 shows the qualitative results in terms of the detected continuum and line emission - including the detections of high excitation lines of , e.g. , ch@xmath2oh .  4 presents a detailed analysis based on the available continuum and line radiative transfer models and  5 discusses the origin of the observed emission .",

    "the data are compared to detailed continuum and line radiative transfer models to zoom in on the inner few hundred au unhindered by emission from the lower density outer envelope .",
    "the conclusions are as follows :    * compact continuum emission is detected at 850@xmath25 m : the sma observations resolve the compact continuum component , which can be fitted by two structures in addition to the large scale envelope constrained by single - dish observations : a resolved , 300  au sized , gaussian brightness distribution and an unresolved ( @xmath94  au ) structure , the latter contributing about 30% of the flux of the compact continuum component .",
