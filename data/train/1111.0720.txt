    "the development of string theory has revealed a vacuum structure of the universe , so - called  the string theory landscape \" where many metastable vacuum states exist .",
    "then , the study of cdl instantons  @xcite describing the decay of such metastable states has attracted much interest recently .",
    "the vacuum decay in a fixed background has been well understood thanks to the seminal papers by coleman and his collaborators  @xcite . however , tunneling in the presence of gravity is still controversial .",
    "for example , the existence of negative modes may be gauge dependent for cdl instanton solutions  @xcite .",
    "hence , interpretation of the cdl instantons is not so clear  .",
    "moreover , there exist some claims on the string theory landscape that contradict each other .",
    "it is claimed that the eternal inflation may populate the string theory landscape  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is insisted that one of the effects of gravitational backreaction might be missing in the thin - wall approximation for the cdl instantons  @xcite .",
    "then the decay rate is enhanced if we take into account the effect .",
    "it implies that most of vacua rapidly decay and the string theory landscape would not be relevant to cosmology .",
    "furthermore , there is a dispute on the interpretation of the decay rate of the metastable vacuum into an ads vacuum  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth pursuing the study of the vacuum decay with gravity .    it would be beneficial if we had an analytic treatment of the cdl instanton solutions describing the vacuum decay with gravity .",
    "so far , the only available tool has been the thin - wall approximation .",
    "however , since the string theory landscape has a variety of vacua , there is a limitation of the thin - wall approximation .",
    "of course , one can resort to the numerical analysis .",
    "however , it is difficult to grasp the physics behind numerical calculations .",
    "therefore , we need analytical tools beyond the thin - wall approximation . in fixed background cases , it is not so difficult to construct exactly solvable models  @xcite . recently , an attempt to construct analytic cdl solutions has been performed  @xcite .",
    "the method is well known in the literature of braneworld  @xcite .",
    "however , they did not get analytic forms of potential functions  @xcite . in this paper , we present exact cdl instantons for the first time by focusing on the hm instantons  @xcite .",
    "the hm instantons , which are nothing but euclidean ds solutions , play an important role when the cdl instantons disappear . when the curvature scale of the potential barrier is large compared to the scale determined by the potential energy , cdl instantons exist . as the curvature scale becomes small , however",

    "hence , it is expected that we can construct the cdl instantons by making deformation of the euclidean ds solutions .",
    "indeed , we find many exact cdl instantons using this strategy .",
    "in particular , we find potentials for which we can construct exact cdl instantons .",
    "using our exactly solvable models , we can calculate decay rates analytically .",
    "so far , vacuum decays from ds to ds and from ds to minkowski have been well discussed in conjunction with cosmology .",
    "however , recent string theory landscape picture tells us the importance of ads vacua .",
    "hence , our primary interest in this paper is the vacuum decay rate to the ads vacuum .",
    "we note that banks argued that the decay to an ads crunch is an actual fate of the decay process  @xcite . using our exactly solvable models ,",

    "this corresponds to the unconventional interpretation discussed above , and again the decay rate would not be suppressed .    on the other hand , as we have argued previously , we may discard @xmath12 from the action for ads space in eq .",
    "( [ physical ] ) . under this prescription",
    ", the action for ads vacuum diverges negatively and the decay rate vanishes .",
    "this is the conventional interpretation . at the moment",
    ", however , we feel it is still premature to extract definite conclusion from the thick - wall cdl instantons .",
    "motivated by the string theory landscape , we have studied the vacuum decay into ads vacuum with gravity .",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining exactly solvable cdl instantons .",
    "we focused on the fact that the cdl instantons can be obtained by deforming hm instantons .",
    "we first gave a scale factor of a deformed hm instanton .",
    "once a scale factor is given , the scalar field and the potential function can be obtained as a function of the radial coordinate . combining them",
    ", we analytically obtained the potential function for the deformed hm instanton . in this way ,",
    "we have obtained exact cdl instantons systematically . as a result",
    ", we have constructed exactly solvable models corresponding to the decay process from ds , ads and minkowski spaces into ads spaces .",
    "it is known that there exist either compact or non - compact cdl instantons depending on the shape of the potential  @xcite . in this paper , as we focused only on compact instantons , we did not have to be bothered with non - compact cdl instantons . in principle , however , we can find a variety of exact solutions including non - compact cdl instantons by extending our method  @xcite .",
    "as we got exact cdl instantons , we also succeeded in evaluating the action for the decay rate analytically .",
    "we have calculated the decay rate for the vacuum decay into the ads vacuum . we have also revealed a subtle point in evaluating decay rates for thick - wall cdl instantons .",
    "all of the decay processes we have considered go to an ads crunch singularity  @xcite .",
    "this would be a problem in the string theory landscape . a proposal of holographic excision  @xcite may help to cure this singularity .",
