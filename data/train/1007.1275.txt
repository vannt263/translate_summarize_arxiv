    "there are some indications that more than one component or site contributes to the abundances of the so called r - process elements  @xcite .",

    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "the elemental abundances observed in the atmosphere of these very old stars come from a few events",
    ". these stars generally present a robust pattern for `` heavy '' elements @xmath1 , in agreement with the expected contribution of the r - process to the solar system , but show some scatter for `` light '' elements @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that at least two types of primary nucleosynthesis events contribute to the abundances of those elements .    the first indication for these two nucleosynthesis components came from meteoritic data on @xmath3i and @xmath4hf  @xcite .",
    "the idea of the different components was later extended to account for all abundances in metal - poor stars in the phenomenological model of  @xcite .",
    "they argued that supernovae from low - mass progenitors with @xmath5 ( h - source in their terminology ) lead to all `` heavy '' and some `` light '' elements , and that explosions of more massive progenitors , @xmath6 ( l - source ) , contribute to the remaining light @xmath7 elements .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached independently by  @xcite using a slightly different pattern for the l - source ( lepp source in their terminology ) .",
    "the abundances of star hd  122563  @xcite were used to build an l - source pattern .",
    "this star shows mainly elements produced in the l - source with small contamination from the h - source , characterized by the abundances observed in cs  22892 - 052  @xcite . while  @xcite assumed that all material above @xmath8 in hd  122563 was produced by the h - source ,  @xcite used a smaller h - source contribution responsible for all the abundance of elements heavier than @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite discussed the assumption that hd  122563 is representative of the l - source by showing a hint of robustness of the observed pattern of ump stars .",
    "however , more observations of l - source enriched ( or r - process poor ) ump stars are needed before a definitive conclusion is reached . in this paper , the lepp ( or l - source ) pattern was taken from @xcite based on the abundances of @xcite .",
    "it covers elements in the range @xmath10 and it is assumed to be robust .",
    "more recently ,  @xcite updated their two - component model to include a third component producing fe but not @xmath11 elements .",
    "the need for an additional component resulted from using newer higher - resolution data that included many stars with @xmath12}\\le -3 $ ] where the amount of fe ( produced originally only in the l - source ) relative to sr ( produced in both l- and h- sources ) was too large compared to the yields based on the two - component model .    the process leading to elements with @xmath7 ( l - source ) has been called in the literature the weak r - process  @xcite , charged - particle reaction ( cpr ) process  @xcite , and lighter element primary process ( lepp )  @xcite . in this paper , we refer to this process as lepp because it does not make any reference to the specific nuclear reactions or astrophysical environment .",
    "the term lepp was first introduced in  @xcite which used a galactic chemical evolution model to search for the astrophysical environments producing the elements sr , y , and zr . using their s - process model and standard r - process contributions",
    ", they found that non - negligible abundances of several isotopes ( @xmath13sr , @xmath14nb , @xmath15mo , @xmath16ru , @xmath17pd , @xmath18cd ) were still unexplained .",
    "@xcite showed that the lepp elemental abundances that result from using the  @xcite model are in agreement , within the observational error bars , with the modified abundances of hd  122563 ( fig .  5 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of the lepp to the solar abundances depends on the s - process model .",
    "if further refinements to s - process models eliminate or change the need for a lepp contribution to the solar system abundances , the apparent agreement between the `` solar '' lepp and the ump observations would have been coincidental . in that case the lepp may only contribute to the abundances of a few metal - poor stars .",
    "after the initial success of  @xcite in reproducing observed r - process abundances , core - collapse supernovae and the subsequent neutrino - driven winds became one of the most promising candidates for the production of r - process elements because their extreme explosive conditions are very close to the ones needed for the r - process  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , galactic chemical evolution models favor core - collapse supernovae , since they occur early and frequently enough to account for the abundances observed in old halo stars and in the solar system  @xcite .",
    "although the necessary conditions to produce heavy elements ( @xmath19 ) are identified  @xcite ( high entropies , low electron fractions , and short expansion timescales ) , these are not found in the most recent long - time supernova simulations  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we find that the @xmath20 evolution has to follow either a rapid increase so the amount of iron - group elements ejected stays low , or it has to start already at @xmath121 so there is only a minor production of these elements .",

    "although , this is not fully consistent , it allows us to investigate the influence of the neutrino luminosity on the abundances separately from the effect of other wind parameters .",
    "we find that a reduction of the luminosity by a factor 2 ( dashed line , `` l/2 '' ) leads to the production of only @xmath126 elements .",
    "a factor of 5 reduction is enough to inhibit the production of any lepp elements , as the flow can barely pass through the bottleneck at @xmath98ge .",
    "we note that previous nucleosynthesis studies based on the explosion model of  @xcite do not produce lepp elements  @xcite because the ( anti)neutrino luminosity of this low mass progenitor ( @xmath127 ) is rather small and the expansion is very fast",

    "if @xmath20 decreases to @xmath131 , elements up to @xmath132 can be produced .",
    "contrary to proton - rich conditions , different @xmath20 evolutions lead to significant changes in the pattern .",
    "this sensitivity in the final abundances is due to the abrupt drop of the neutron abundance near @xmath115 ( shown in fig .",

    "mass elements ejected at slightly different times ( and therefore with small variations of the entropy and the expansion timescales ) show a substantial difference on the neutron - to - seed ratio and subsequently on the abundances , making again difficult to get a robust pattern .",
    "such strong dependence of the final abundances on the wind parameters is also found for the other models introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in model 15m(s ) the electron fraction has to be reduced down to @xmath134 to produce elements up to @xmath132 .",

    "the amount of heavy nuclei produced is higher than in the proton - rich winds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abund_ye ] ) , the overproduction around a  =  90 ( related to the neutron magic number n  =  50 ,  @xcite ) becomes a constraint .",
    "similar to the conclusion reached for the proton - rich conditions , this suggests that not all mass ejected in neutrino - driven winds in core - collapse supernovae experience neutron - rich conditions .",
    "previous results   suggest that only a small amount of the mass ejected by core - collapse supernovae can be neutron - rich .",
    "it is possible that the neutron richness of the ejecta depends on progenitor mass because more massive stars lead to more compact neutron stars and thus higher neutrino energies , which may favour neutron - rich conditions .",
    "a different alternative to avoid the overproduction is to have anisotropic explosions with an electron fraction distribution in the ejecta that achieves neutron - rich conditions only in some regions .",
    "recent two - dimensional supernova simulations present proton - rich ejecta with neutron - rich blobs or pockets that contain only a small mass  @xcite .",
    "further investigations are necessary to conclude which of the possibilities addressed here can explain the observations of lepp elements in ump stars . based on spherical symmetric simulations",
    "we have showed that it is possible to reproduce the lepp elemental pattern under different wind conditions .",
    "multidimensional simulations will determine the effect of anisotropic @xmath20 distribution on the wind nucleosynthesis .",
    "such multidimensional simulations combined with exploratory studies like ours will provide constraints for the specific conditions ( e.g. , @xmath20 evolution ) and for the overall contribution of neutron- and proton - rich winds to the solar system inventory .",
    "using our results , it is hard to obtain the solar lepp pattern  @xcite by combining neutron- and proton - rich conditions .",
    "moreover , galactic chemical evolution models are necessary before a definite conclusion can be drawn to the exact contribution of core - collapse supernovae to the solar systems abundances .",
    "we have performed nucleosynthesis calculations based on spherically symmetric supernova simulations  @xcite which include efficient neutrino transport and follow the evolution of the ejecta from a few milliseconds to several seconds after bounce during the neutrino - driven wind phase .",
    "the integrated nucleosynthesis was analyzed for different stellar progenitors with masses of 10 ,  15 ,  and  25  @xmath116 .",
    "we have found that light element primary process abundances can be produced under realistic conditions in the neutrino - wind phase .",
    "no heavy r - process elements can be synthesized under those conditions  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results indicate that the nucleosynthesis occurring in neutrino - driven winds does not depend significantly on the progenitor , but rather on the proto - neutron star evolution which in turn directly affects nucleosynthesis - relevant wind parameters  @xcite such as entropy , expansion timescale , and electron fraction .",
    "the electron fraction depends on neutrino properties which are determined by the still uncertain neutrino interactions and transport . since the calculation of the electron fraction remains challenging  @xcite the impact of the electron fraction on the production of lepp elements",
    "was studied . the lepp pattern obtained by  @xcite",
    "was reproduced for different evolutions of the electron fraction towards proton- and neutron - rich conditions .",
    "the lepp pattern reproduced in proton - rich winds was found to be robust under small variations in the evolution wind parameters .",
    "nevertheless , elements heavier than iron - group nuclei can only be produced when the neutrino fluxes are high enough to allow for a successful @xmath100p - process .",
    "the amount of heavy elements ejected is rather low since most of the outflow matter consists of protons and @xmath21-particles .",
    "although the elemental abundances nicely reproduce the observed lepp pattern , mainly neutron - deficient isotopes are produced ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , proton - rich conditions can explain the lepp elements observed in ump stars but not in the missing isotopic underabundances in the solar system  @xcite .",
    "when the electron fraction is assumed to evolve towards neutron - rich conditions , the lepp pattern can be also reproduced but it is not robust under small variations of the wind parameters .",
    "we find an overproduction around @xmath136 that was already pointed out in previous nucleosynthesis studies  @xcite .",
    "this overproduction and the fact that most recent supernova simulations  @xcite favor proton - rich winds could suggest that neutron - rich winds are rare events . scenarios that could explain the ejection of only a small amount of neutron - rich material include 1 ) very small pockets with neutron - rich material that may appear in multidimensional simulations  @xcite ; 2 ) neutron - rich conditions that can only be obtained at very late times when the amount of ejected mass is very small ; 3 ) there is only a small subset of all supernovae that can develop neutron - rich winds .",
    "the isotopic underabundances reported by @xcite can not be reproduced based in our models without overproducing other isotopes .",
    "evolving from proton to neutron conditions in the wind does not resolve the overproduction , which could be a hint of the limitation of our models .",
    "however , this can also suggest deficiencies in the s - process model used by @xcite",
    ". we can not conclude whether the solar and the ump stars lepp abundances are produced by the same light element primary process .",
    "observation of isotopic abundances in ump stars would constrain the evolution of the electron fraction and thus of the neutrino properties in supernovae . in addition",
