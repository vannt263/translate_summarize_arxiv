    "understanding the nuclear activity in nearby galaxies is essential for constraining the galaxy formation and evolution process .",
    "while energetically unimpressive , the nearby galactic nuclei offer the best case scenario for ( 1 ) the most common state of accretion in the current universe , ( 2 ) the end - point of quasar evolution , or simply ( 3 ) their scaled - down version .",
    "observationally , the low redshift @xmath3 accretion systems are the best testbeds for identifying the processes involved in triggering and further fuelling accretion onto the central black hole ( bh ) because they offer unique joint investigations of both the nuclear accretion and the properties of the host , i.e. , the star - formation ( sf ) .    unlike the optically luminous quasars , which are radiating close to their eddington limit @xcite , and only for short ( @xmath11 yr ) times @xcite",
    ", accretion activity in nearby galaxy centers appears extremely diverse , spanning @xmath12 orders of magnitude in the eddington ratio , and ( maybe consequently ) a wide range in their duty - cycles @xcite .",
    "this variety provides empirical constraints to model predictions linking the bh growth rate and the host bulge formation .",
    "the two are indeed connected : it is the younger galaxies that host the more rapidly growing bhs @xcite .",
    "the exact physical mechanism responsible for this link , and in general for the close interplay between sf and bh accretion remains however elusive .",
    "simulations place important constraints on different models for the way black holes are fueled , and provide a quantitative and physical distinction between local , low luminosity , weak ( or quiescent ) agn activity , and violent , merger - driven bright quasars @xcite .",
    "environmental studies of the nearby active galactic nuclei are consistent with these ideas of non - merger - driven fueling for the weak bh growth observed in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "more recent analysis of the observed distribution of eddington ratios as a function of the bh masses provide additional constraints , suggesting that even at @xmath3 there might be two distinct regimes of bh growth , which are determined by the supply of cold gas in the host bulge .",
    "the bh regulates its own growth at a rate that is independent of the interstellar medium s characteristics as long as the gas is plentiful , but when the gas runs out the bh s growth will be regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass @xcite .",
    "these different fueling modes at low luminosities must manifest differently at wavelengths outside the optical regime , allowing further means to constrain and discriminate among them .    the most ubiquitous type of activity at @xmath3 that resembles that of quasars is identified at optical wavelengths as either a narrow - lined low ionization nuclear emission regions(liner , l ) or a `` transition '' ( t ) object , whose properties border on the definition of a starburst galaxy and an agn .",
    "emission - line ratio diagnostics @xcite that have been quite successful in identifying cases where the dominant ionization mechanism is either accretion onto a black hole ( i.e. , seyferts , ss ) or radiation from hot , young stars ( i.e. , h ii nuclei ) , remain inconclusive for the majority of ls and ts . the ls that exhibit quasar - like broad lines ( l1s , by analogy with seyfert 1s )",
    "are unambiguously accretion - powered sources , however those lacking these features ( the l2s ) could have lines generated by shocks , post - starbursts , or other processes unrelated with accretion . deciphering the underlying emission source(s ) of these ambiguous nuclei",
    "is an ongoing struggle .",
    "recent analyses of the emission properties of the low luminosity agn ( llagn ) in relation to a wide variety of characteristics of their hosts , together with considerations of their small and large scale environments , reveal a sequence _ h ii @xmath1 seyfert / transition object @xmath1 liner @xmath1 passive _ ( _ h ii @xmath1 s / t @xmath1 l @xmath1 p _ ) that these objects obey , at least in a statistical sense ( constantin & vogeley 2006 ; schawinski et al .",
    "2007 ; constantin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this sequence traces trends in ( 1 ) increasing host halo mass , ( 2 ) increasing environmental density , ( 3 ) increasing central bh mass and host stellar mass , ( 4 ) decreasing bh accretion rate , ( 5 ) aging of the stellar population associated with their nuclei , and ( 6 ) decreasing in the amount of dust obscuration , which might translate into a decrease in the amount of material available for star - forming or accretion .",
    "this sequence therefore suggests a process of transformation of galaxies from sf via agn to quiescence , which may be the first empirical evidence for an analogous duty cycle to that of the high @xmath5 bright systems ( i.e. , quasars ) .",
    "state of the art hydrodynamical models provide clear support for such a scenario , by showing that during mergers , the bh accretion peaks considerably _ after _ the merger started , and _",
    "after _ the star - formation rate has peaked ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2005 , hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) . constraining the nature of this _",
    "h ii @xmath1 s / t @xmath1 l _ sequence at @xmath3 will improve our understanding of the degree to which the llagn phenomenon fits into the galactic bh accretion paradigm .",
    "the x - ray emission is , arguably , the most sensitive test for accretion and its intensity and efficiency , and thus , it is of great interest to test and validate this sequence against large homogeneous x - ray selected samples .",
    "the chandra multiwavelength project ( champ ; green et al .",
    "2004 ) provides a unique opportunity for this , by providing the largest - area chandra survey to date , which , when cross - matched with the sdss , provides an unprecedented number of galaxies in the local universe for which we can combine and contrast measurements of the x - ray and optical emission .",
    "the sample of @xmath13 chandra x - ray detected nearby galaxies ( excluding broad line objects ) analysed in this study represents a significant improvement in both sample size and homogeneity both for x - ray selection and optical spectral type coverage .",
    "previous studies of the relation between the x - ray nuclear emission , optical emission line activity and black hole masses provide important physical constraints to the llagn phenomenon .",
    "almost invariably , the conclusions are that llagn are probably scaled down versions of more luminous agn @xcite , and that @xmath14 is not the main driver of the ( soft ) x - ray properties @xcite .",
    "the llagn are claimed to be x - ray detected at relatively high rates , and are found to be relatively unabsorbed , obscuration appearing to play only a minor role in their detection rates and/or in classifying them as types 1 and 2 in x - rays @xcite , with the exception of those known to be compton thick .",
    "nonetheless , the x - ray investigations of agn activity at its lowest levels remain largely restricted to ls and ss .    deciphering the ambiguous nature of ls in particular , has been the target of many x - ray studies of llagn focused on these sources @xcite .",
    "a hard , power - law agn signal is generally @xmath15 resolved for the majority of them , however , the corresponding energy ( photon ) index is marginally steeper ( softer ) than in ( broad line ) ss ; many of them require a soft thermal component , that somehow differs from the blackbody soft excess commonly seen in ss and quasars . the fe k@xmath16 emission or the compton reflection component",
    "are usually weak in these sources , indicating that x - ray reprocessing is not by material in an optically thick accretion disk @xcite .",
    "because most of these studies are based on large - beam observations , mostly @xmath17 or @xmath18 , ls emission has also quite often been attributed to stellar processes .",
    "higher spatial resolution @xmath19 and @xmath20 observations @xcite remain torn between these findings , as the stellar interpretation persists for quite a number of these sources .    in this work we approach the llagn phenomenon via the _ h  ii @xmath1 s / t @xmath1 l @xmath1 passive _ galaxy evolutionary sequence described above . in particular , we test the validity of the sequence within x - ray selected llagn via a large variety of optical emission properties , which first provided evidence for the sequence , and also in their x - ray properties .",
    "we combine the champ x - ray detections with a sample of sdss dr4 nearby galaxies that excludes broad line objects , creating a large sample of galaxy nuclei that spans a range of spectral types , from passive to actively line emitting systems , including the star - forming and accreting types , along with those of mixed or ambiguous ionization . through measurements of their x - ray spectra that best fits a power - law @xmath21 , fluxes and luminosities , we characterize the sequence in terms of strength and mode of accretion .",
    "we provide here the first investigation of the relation between @xmath2 and the eddington ratio @xmath4 at the lowest levels of accretion .",
    "we reveal a rather surprising anti - correlation between these two measures , opposite to what luminous agn and quasars exhibit .",
    "this finding reveals a turning point in the general @xmath22 relation followed by agn , which is identical ( within the errors ) to that shown by the @xmath23 trends in black hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) .    throughout this work",
    "we assume @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 km s@xmath27 mpc@xmath27 .",
    "the sample of llagn employed in this study is obtained by cross - matching the sdss dr4 spectroscopic sample of galaxies with the x - ray detected sources identified as part of the @xmath19 multiwavelength project ( champ ) .",
    "champ is a wide - area serendipitous x - ray survey based on archival x - ray images of the @xmath28 deg sky , obtained with chandra s axaf ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "a summary of the survey is presented in  @xcite and  @xcite , while champ results and data can be found at http://hea-www.harvard.edu/champ .",
    "the x - ray analysis extends to a total of 392 fields through @xmath19 cycle 6 , that cover a total of @xmath29 deg@xmath30 of sky area .",
    "we limit the investigation to the dr4 dataset in order to employ the measurements of absorption and emission line fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) drawn from the catalog built by the mpa / jhu collaboration . here",
    "the line emission component is separated and subtracted from the total galaxy spectrum based on fits of stellar population synthesis templates  @xcite .",
    "the catalog does not include broad - line objects .",
    "to relate the central bh accretion activity to the host properties , we employ stellar masses of galaxies and the h@xmath31 balmer absorption - line index as a proxy for the age of the associated stellar population , as calculated and presented by @xcite . a detailed analysis of these properties , and their relation to the agn phenomenon revealed through optical signatures ,",
    "are presented in @xcite .",
    "the cross - match of all champ sky regions imaged by acis with the sdss dr4 spectroscopic footprint results in a parent sample of 15955 galaxies on or near a chip , and a subset of 199 sources that are x - ray detected . among those ,",
    "only 107 sources have an off - axis angle ( oaa ) @xmath32 deg . and avoid @xmath33 due to high serial readout noise ; these objects comprise the main sample we employ for this study .",
    "subsequent subsections present details of the x - ray spectral analysis , together with a presentation of their general optical and x - ray properties , the definition of the subsamples based on their optical spectral properties , and a discussion of the selection effects associated with these samples .",
    "@xmath19 imaging with acis provides energy resolution sufficient to constrain the x - ray spectral properties as well . to characterize the x - ray activity of the champ - sdss galaxies included in our sample ,",
    "we perform direct spectral fits to the counts distribution using the full instrument calibration , known redshift and galactic 21 cm column taken from @xcite for the @xmath19 aimpoint position on the sky . ]",
    "source spectra are extracted from circular regions with radii corresponding to energy encircled fractions of @xmath35 , while the background region encompasses a 20 annulus , centered on the source , with separation 4 , from the source region .",
    "any nearby sources are excised , both from the source and the background regions .",
    "the spectral fitting is done via yaxx @xcite , an automated script that employs the ciao @xmath36 tool .",
    "each spectrum is fitted in the range 0.5  8 kev by two different models : ( 1 ) a single power - law plus absorption fixed at the galactic 21 cm value : ( model `` pl '' ) , and ( 2 ) a fixed power - law of photon index @xmath37 plus intrinsic absorption of column @xmath38 ( model `` plfix '' ) .",
    "these fits use the powell optimization method , and provide a robust and reliable one - parameter characterization of the spectral shape for any number of counts .",
    "spectra with less than 100 net counts were fit using the ungrouped data with cash statistics @xcite , while those with more than 100 counts were grouped to a minimum of 16 counts per bin and fit using the @xmath39 statistic with variance computed from the data . for the ( 9 ) objects with more than 200 counts we employ a third model where both the slope of the power - law and the intrinsic absorption are free to vary ( model `` pl_abs '' ) .",
    "many of the x - ray detected galaxies in our sample have relatively few net counts ( mean 76 , median 19 ) . in such cases , instrumental hardness ratios is often used , in the belief that genuine spectra fitting is not warranted by the data quality .",
    "we stress however that spectral fitting provides the most consistent and robust estimates of the physical parameters of interest , the power law slope and intrinsic absorption . because the champ x - ray exposures span a variety of intervening galactic columns , include data from both back- and front - side acis ccds , and span 6 years of observations , the spectral response between sources varies significantly . while constraints from spectral fitting may not be tight for low count sources , use of unbinned event data and the appropriate response gives an optimal and unbiased estimate of the fit parameters and their uncertainties , especially important when absorption may be present at different redshifts .",
    "classical hardness ratio analysis on the other hand amounts to grouping the data into two rather arbitrary bins , introducing potential biases and statistical complexity . interpreting the hardness ratio value for champ sources in disparate fields",
    "requires incorporating the instrument response in any case , so we strongly prefer spectral fitting . nevertheless , when there is only one free parameter , only the overall spectral shape is constrained .",
    "this simple parametrization proves generally sufficient to model the 0.5  8 kev spectra of these objects .",
    "comparisons of 0.5  8 kev fluxes @xmath40 ( and luminosities @xmath0 ) obtained from the pl and plfix models show good agreement , for the whole sample of galaxies , the average ( median ) of the difference in these values being 0.07 ( 0.01 ) dex .",
    "we caution that the simple power - law fits we use here could be misleading for objects where the absorption is complex ( i.e. , a partial covering , with one or more absorber potentially being ionized ) . however , the data quality is insufficient to show that the situation is more complex than a simple power - law .",
    "we compile a set of `` best '' measurements for @xmath2 or @xmath38 , by using the values obtained from the pl ( intrinsic @xmath38 fixed at zero ) and plfix ( @xmath2 fixed at 1.9 ) models , respectively . for objects with more than 200 counts we use the @xmath2 and @xmath38 values obtained from the pl_abs .",
    "the mean @xmath2 for the whole sample of 107 galaxies is 2.03 @xmath411.38 , with a median of 2.04 .",
    "the level of intrinsic absorption is generally low . more than 85% of the sample exhibits",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 , while for 60% of the objects the spectral fits are consistent with zero intrinsic absorption .",
    "note that , given the simplified model used in fitting the x - ray spectra , these values might not necessarily represent the true distribution of absorption in these objects .",
    "individual measurements of all of these x - ray properties , together with their observational parameters , like the total number of x - ray counts , the exposure time , the off - axis angle , together with their corresponding x - ray source i d , are listed in table  [ table - xray ] for all 107 objects .",
    "contribution from thermal emission is expected for some of the objects included in this sample of nearby galaxies , whether or not they show line emission activity .",
    "such a component may provide a reasonable contribution to the total ( x - ray ) emission even in objects where the dominant ionization mechanism , as identified optically , is a compact nuclear source , i.e. , an agn .",
    "liners , for instance , have frequently been associated with photoionization by hot , young stars @xcite , clusters of planetary nebula nuclei @xcite , or more recently ( and perhaps more consistent with their older stellar populations ) , by hot post - agb stars and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we attempted fitting the @xmath44 kev spectra with a raymond - smith ( r - s ) thermal plasma model , with the abundance fixed at 0.5 solar .",
    "the choice of abundance level is inspired by previous investigations of llagn , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , even though in many cases the abundance remains poorly constrained .",
    "this r - s model fit results seem physically feasible for only about the third of the sample .",
    "reasonable values , in agreement with previous findings , i.e. , @xmath45 kev are only found for 35 sources .",
    "for another third the best fit @xmath46 kev .",
    "we discuss in more detail the results of fitting this model as a function of the optical spectroscopic properties of these sources in section  [ xgen ] . as probably expected , it is the passive galaxies that show the softest power - law slopes we measure ( @xmath47 ) , suggesting that , for these cases in particular , a power - law representation may be incorrect .",
    "if we instead fit a raymond - smith model , we derive reasonable typical temperatures near @xmath48 kev . nonetheless , since even these objects are likely to have some power - law contribution from x - ray binaries , the r - s model is perhaps no better a characterization of the true spectrum than a power - law .",
    "the x - ray flux distribution we derive from the r - s model fits to passive galaxies is not significantly different ( @xmath49 ) , so we prefer to retain the power - law fits everywhere to facilitate more direct comparison of the different spectral classes .",
    "we identify and classify accretion sources and other types of active systems in both the parent galaxy sample and the x - ray detected subsample , based on their optical emission line properties .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the best way to separate accretion sources from starbursts or other types of active systems is via a set of three diagnostic diagrams , which employ four line flux ratios : [ ] @xmath505007/h@xmath51 , [ ] @xmath506583/h@xmath16 , [ ] @xmath526716,6731/h@xmath16 , and [ ] @xmath506300/h@xmath16 .",
    "thus , for both samples , we first select a subset of strong emission - line sources that show significant emission in all six lines used in the type classification ( h@xmath16 , h@xmath51 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] ) , and a set of passive objects that show insignificant line emission activity .",
    "an emission feature is considered to be significant if its line flux is positive and is measured with at least 2@xmath53 confidence . following  @xcite classification criteria ,",
    "the emission - line objects are separated into seyferts ( ss ) , liners ( ls ) , transition objects ( ts ) , and star - forming , or h ii galaxy nuclei .",
    "this method of classifying low luminosity actively line - emitting galaxy nuclei has the disadvantage that it leaves unclassified a high fraction ( @xmath54 40% ) of galaxies , which show strong emission features , but not in all six lines considered here .",
    "the condition for strong emission in [ ] in particular is significantly restrictive .",
    "moreover , another quite large ( @xmath54 25% ) fraction of the emission - line objects remains unclassified , as their line ratios , although accurately measured , do not correspond to a clear spectral type in all three diagrams . in the majority of such cases , while the [ ] /h@xmath16 ratio shows relatively high , s - like values , the corresponding [ ] /h@xmath16 and/or [ ] /h@xmath16 place them in the t or h ii -like object regime ; thus , because the [ ] and [ ] emission lines are better agn - diagnostics than [ ] , these systems are likely to be excluded from the agn samples selected via these classifications . as a consequence ,",
    "our samples based on the 6-line classification are small .",
    "to enlarge our samples of galaxy nuclei of all spectral types , we also explored an emission - line classification based on only the [ ] /h@xmath51 vs. [ ] /h@xmath16 diagram , i.e. , a 4-line classification method , for the x - ray detected sources .",
    "the emission line galaxy samples comprise thus all objects showing at least 2@xmath53 confidence in the line flux measurements of these four lines only .",
    "the delimitation criteria of h ii s and t s remain unchanged , while ss and ls are defined to be all objects situated above the  @xcite separation line , and with [ ] /h@xmath51 @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the 4-line and 6-line classifications result in significantly different classes when applied to optically selected galaxies in general @xcite . in particular , true properties become heavily blended into the dominant population of liners ( or ts , depending on the separation lines used in the diagnostic diagrams ) .",
    "interestingly , however , when applied to the x - ray sample , the 4-line classes fall well within the 6-line loci ; although ss and ls are separated only by their [ ] /h@xmath51 line flux ratio , they remain clearly separated into the [ ] /h@xmath16 and [ ] /h@xmath16 diagrams as well .",
    "figure  [ bpt ] shows how the 6-line ( top ) and the 4-line ( bottom ) classifications compare for the champ x - ray detected galaxies .",
    "although the sample of x - ray detected galaxies is small , this comparison indicates that adding x - ray detection makes the 4-line classification more secure , and that the need for the ( usually unavailable ) [ ] /h@xmath51 vs. [ ] /h@xmath16 , and [ ] /h@xmath51 vs. [ ] /h@xmath16 diagrams is not as stringent as in the cases where only optical information is available .",
    "we will thus consider for the analysis presented in this paper only the 4-line classification .",
    "the `` cleaning '' role of the x - ray detection in finding and defining llagn is even more obvious when we compare the fractions of x - ray detected objects by spectral type , both relative to the parent sample of nearby optically selected objects and the subsample of x - ray detected galaxies .",
    "table  [ stats ] lists these percentages , where for the parent optically selected sample we consider only the sdss galaxies on acis chips ( excluding chip s4 , @xmath57 ) , and with off - axis angle @xmath32deg , consistent with the conditions used in compiling the x - ray samples .",
    "the first two columns show the number ( and fraction ) that each spectral type represents , among ( 1 ) the optical parent sample and ( 2 ) the x - ray - detected subsample .",
    "the third column lists the raw fraction of x - ray detections per spectral type .    that the x - ray detection is very efficient in finding llagn , particularly seyferts , is quite apparent .",
    "while narrow - line ss usually make up only @xmath58 @xcite of the optically selected nearby galaxies , the x - ray detection increases the chances of finding them tenfold .",
    "ts and ls , where an agn contribution to the total ionization power is expected , are also much better represented in the x - ray detected sample of galaxies , their fractions being @xmath59 larger than when only optical selection is employed .",
    "some 65% of the optically defined ss are detected in x - rays , while the other spectral types hardly reach an x - ray detection fraction of @xmath60 .",
    "ls are the second most x - ray active sources within nearby galaxies , while ts and the galaxies that show some / weak emission line activity account for less than 1/5th of the sample .",
    "as we discuss further in section  [ xgen ] , only the luminous hiis are detected in x - rays .",
    "while the x - ray detection rate of the h iis is basically consistent with zero , when detected , their x - ray emission is moderately strong , @xmath61 erg s@xmath27 ; half of the h ii detections show x - ray luminosities higher than the level that can be reached without contribution from agn ( @xmath62 erg s@xmath27 ) , suggesting once more that the nuclear emission in these sources might not be completely driven by stellar processes .    the only previous studies that encompass the whole spectral variety of llagn are @xcite and @xcite , which employ rosat ( hri and rass respectively ) .",
    "their search for x - ray emitting nearby galaxy nuclei , optically characterized via the palomar and sdss surveys respectively , concluded in soft x - ray detection rates of @xmath63 of both ss and ls ( hri ) , @xmath63 of ss and @xmath64 ls ( rass ) , @xmath65 ( hri ) and @xmath66 ( rass ) of h ii s , and @xmath67 of passive galaxies ( both cases ) .",
    "comparison of these detection rates to ours is problematic , because of their softer instrument bandpass , lower sensitivity , but wider sky coverage .",
    "hard x - ray studies of homogeneously selected samples including all spectral types of nearby active galaxies are practically non - existent .",
    "ls , and particularly those found in the palomar survey , have been clearly privileged in terms of x - ray targeting @xcite .",
    "their detection rates are found to be significantly higher than what we report here based on the serendipitous champ survey .",
    "ho et al . (",
    "2001 ) reports a @xmath63 detection rate , while , when chosen for having a flat - spectrum radio core , ls are found to be @xmath68 x - ray active @xcite . later",
    "studies claiming better accounting for selection and classification as liner @xcite conclude with lower fractions , @xmath69 .",
    "champ has the distinct advantage of presenting a large , homogeneous serendipitous sample of llagn .",
    "the detection fraction is not an intrinsic property of galaxies , but rather a convolution of galaxy properties with optical survey depth , and the x - ray sensitivity vs. sky area curve .",
    "as described in @xcite , the champ is characterising the x - ray sensitivity at the position of every sdss galaxy , which will enable us to compile the unbiased fraction of galaxies by optical spectral type ( e.g. , ls ) that fall in x - ray luminosity bins , from sky volumes complete to those limits .",
    "we will present the results of such an investigation in a subsequent paper .",
    "x - ray and optical emission are correlated .",
    "thus , while the x - ray selection is one of the most powerful tools to exploit in detecting accretion sources , it is also expected that this selection picks up , selectively , the brightest ( optical ) sources .",
    "due to its serendipitous character , champ should however reduce such effects .",
    "note that , out of 107 x - ray detections that this champ sample of galaxies provides , only 13 are targets .",
    "we explore in figure  [ host ] the biases that x - ray detection potentially adds to our sample .",
    "comparisons of the distributions of redshift @xmath5 , apparent and absolute @xmath70-band ( sdss ) magnitudes , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , and of the concentration index @xmath72 = @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the radii from the center of a galaxy containing 50% and 90% of the petrosian flux ] as a proxy for the morphological type of these galaxies . both for the whole optically and x - ray selected samples ( histograms on the left panel ) and separately per spectral type ( the right panel ) show , pleasingly , that biases are not strong .    however , h ii galaxies are of lower @xmath5 and brighter @xmath71 when detected in x - ray . as shown in the next section ,",
    "the h iis are generally weak x - ray sources .",
    "the tendency for x - ray detected galaxies to appear brighter in apparent magnitude ( @xmath70 , by @xmath76 mag ) seems to be caused by the large difference in @xmath70 between the hii galaxies alone , as all the other types of sources show very similar ranges , averages or medians , when analysed separately .",
    "the concentration index @xmath72 appears to be somewhat larger for the x - ray objects .",
    "several factors are likely to account for this .",
    "the h iis are the least concentrated optically , and have the lowest x - ray detection fraction .",
    "x - ray detection is sensitive to the agn activity , which is more prevalent in the early type ( massive bulge - dominated ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "nuclear activity is also expected to increase @xmath72 simply by adding light to the core .",
    "note that there is no significant difference in this parameter in regard to ss x - ray selection .",
    "however , ss make up for a tiny fraction of @xmath77 galaxies , and the morphology of their hosts spans quite a range .",
    "x - ray information about the nearby galaxy centers constrains the contribution of accretion - related processes to their optical spectral characteristics .",
    "we present in this section the distributions of a variety of x - ray properties for the whole sample as well as for subsamples by optical spectral class .",
    "figure  [ hostx ] shows the distributions of the x - ray counts , the @xmath44kev unabsorbed x - ray fluxes , the best - fit x - ray photon indices @xmath2 and the intrinsic neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath38 .",
    "these measurements are shown for the whole sample of x - ray detected nearby galaxy nuclei ( left column ) , and separately per spectral type ( right column ) .    for x - ray fluxes",
    ", we show the values derived using the primary power - law fitting models discussed in section  [ xanalysis ] : ( 1 ) a single power - law with no intrinsic absorption and ( 2 ) a fixed power - law ( @xmath78 ) with absorption .",
    "the @xmath40 values are generally consistent with each other for the whole range of brightness and optical spectral type . as expected , the x - ray brightest objects are among ss , however , even for this spectral type the range of values remains pretty broad , spanning 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "note also that the few h ii galaxies that are x - ray detected are in general brighter than the passive systems .    in terms of the x - ray spectral shape ,",
    "the champ nearby galaxies are quite a diverse population .",
    "the mean photon index per optical spectral type shows however a rather clear dependence on the spectral type : ss show the hardest @xmath44kev spectral shape , becoming softer and softer from ts to ls to the passive galaxies which are clearly the softest . the h ii galaxies are unexpectedly hard in average @xmath79 , however , two particularly hard detections clearly weight the subsample in this direction .",
    "the ts and ls average at @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath38 values are poorly constrained for this sample , and there is no obvious correlation with the optical spectral type .",
    "it is however obvious that the ss are the sources with the highest fraction of non - zero absorption .",
    "since all our ss are of type 2 , i.e. , lack broad emission lines in their spectra , the unification paradigm predicts that many will show signature of absorption in x - rays . a typical unabsorbed power - law @xmath37 requires a column density of @xmath81 @xmath43 to yield an apparent @xmath82 similar to the mean value found for our s subsample , which is consistent with the observed mean @xmath38 for these particular systems .",

    "@xmath83/@xmath84 @xmath1 l _ cycle .",
    "both the bulge nebular properties , and the small and large scale environments of @xmath83s and @xmath84s , are very similar and remain intermediate between those of h iis and @xmath85s .",
    "the only parameters showing a `` jump '' in the otherwise smooth trends are h@xmath16/h@xmath51 balmer decrements and the nearest neighbor distance @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "h@xmath16/h@xmath51 provides a measure of absorption , and perhaps also the amount of fuel available for accretion , which we can now test directly against both @xmath0 ( accretion power ) and x - ray spectral constraints .",
    "we present in figure  [ seqo ] a comparison of the degree to which optically and x - ray selected galaxies follow the proposed sequence in terms of the black hole mass @xmath14 , obtained via @xmath87 measurements and the @xmath88 relation @xcite , the ( dust corrected ) stellar mass @xmath89 @xcite , the balmer decrement h@xmath16/h@xmath51 as a proxy for dust extinction , the h@xmath31 balmer absorption index as a measure of the age of the associated stellar population , @xmath90 $ ] , and the accretion rate expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath91 $ ] for the bolometric correction @xcite , and the @xmath90 $ ] is extinction - corrected using the corresponding balmer decrements and a @xmath92 attenuation law @xcite .",
    "given the ( spectral ) definition of passive galaxies ( i.e. , lacking optical emission line activity ) , there are no measurements of the balmer decrement , @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath4 for these sources .",
    "it is notable that in all measures , and for all types of sources , the x - ray and optically selected sources are very similar , and appear to obey the _ s @xmath1 t @xmath1 l @xmath1 p _ sequence .    if anything , the sequence appears stronger among the x - ray selected galaxies , both in median / average values and in their distributions of individual measurements , which span smaller ranges of values than for the optically selected objects . among the weakest accreting objects , ls and passive galaxies , the x - ray selection tends to pick up more massive objects , with heavier bhs , and older stellar populations ; there is however no obvious difference in these parameters for the other types of sources .",
    "as expected , these massive systems also appear to have smaller [ ] luminosities and accretion rates , accentuating the sequential @xmath83 to @xmath84 to @xmath85 drop in these parameters suggested by optically selected / defined objects .",
    "also , while the balmer decrement distributions suggest that , in general , the x - ray selection is not strongly affected by dust , the slightly more obscured x - ray detected h iis and less obscured x - ray detected ls make the sequence more apparent .",

    "the sequence is supported by both types of measurements , albeit stronger when the simple power - law model is used .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ xanalysis ] and  [ xgen ] , the free power - law with no intrinsic absorption spectral model , that seems to best characterize this sample of objects , makes the statistical sequence even more probable . for the sequence in the accretion rate , we calculate @xmath4 using @xmath93 for the bolometric luminosity , as suggested by @xcite , and the bh masses estimated from their host stellar velocity dispersion @xmath87 using @xcite",
    ". we also contrast the x - ray measurements with those where @xmath94 derived from @xmath95 $ ] ; note that while @xmath0 and the derived @xmath4 are available for the whole sample of 107 objects , only 69 of them exhibit strong @xmath96 detectable , [ ] line emission .",
    "the @xmath97 galaxy sequence compares well in both optical and x - ray measurements .",
    "the values of all these parameters decrease monotonically in both median and average values , from ss to ts , to ls and passive galaxies , consistent with what optical properties of these sources put forward .",
    "the h iis are the only apparent exception here .",
    "the small number statistics for these galaxy nuclei preclude any strong conclusions . given the expected high sensitivity to soft sources that these measurements provide , their spectra tend to be on the hard side .",
    "obscuration is a notorious cause for spectral hardening , and thus , the possibility that these objects hide in their centers obscured bh accretion is still not ruled out .",
    "note also that the power - law slope @xmath2 that best fits the x - ray spectra increases from ss to ts , to ls , in both median and average values , showing a tendency of softening of the spectra from ss to passive galaxies along the proposed sequence ( figure  [ hostx ] ) .",
    "this is quite an interesting finding , as in other agn , mostly the luminous type 1 agn , observations suggest an opposite trend : the stronger accreting ( and more luminous ) sources are the softer ones , most recently quantified by @xcite . it is interesting to note that a spectral softening with strengthening of the accretion process / rate is also a generally common feature of the x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with reasonably high @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "note however that , when the eddington ratio is less than a critical value , @xmath98 , i.e. , xrbs are observed in their low / hard state , there is a clear trend for softening with further weakening of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "we investigate this finding in more detail in the following section , and discuss the analogy with the xrb phenomenon .",
    "investigations of how x - ray parameters depend on the accretion rate relative to the eddington rate are expected to offer important constraints on physical models of the agn x - ray emitting plasma , particularly its geometry .",
    "a hot , optically thin corona that compton up - scatters uv photons from the optically thick disk @xcite seems to fit reasonably well the x - ray emission of the highly accreting systems , particularly when it is associated with a hot , possibly patchy and `` skin''-like structure `` sandwich''-ing the cold disk @xcite .",
    "other geometries remain however viable , among them an accretion disk evaporating into a hot inner flow @xcite , or combinations of a hot inner flow and the patchy corona @xcite . for llagn , with @xmath99 , the accretion flow has been hypothesized to originate from a geometrically thick and hot disk - like structure that is inefficient at converting gravitational potential energy into radiation , the radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) model @xcite .",
    "models suggest that there is a transition / switch from a standard disk to an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; or , a radiatively inefficient accretion flow , riaf ) when @xmath4 declines below a critical value within a certain transition radius @xcite . in either case , radiation pressure",
    "driven outflows can also alter the physics of the corona @xcite . because the efficiency in producing an x - ray accretion flow and in driving the outflows depends on the bh mass and its accretion rate , it is important to understand the inter - dependence of these parameters on the x - ray properties , particularly the shape of the x - ray spectrum , i.e. , the x - ray photon index @xmath2 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath2 and the eddington ratio @xmath100 is relatively well studied , and yet a controversial issue .",
    "these two parameters seem to be positively correlated for objects accreting at relatively high eddington ratios , i.e. , quasars , luminous type 1 seyferts @xcite , while for low @xmath4 values the situation remains uncertain , mainly due to the lack of quality data in that regime .",
    "the conclusion so far seems to be that the shape of the hard x - ray power - law is largely controlled by @xmath4 . for the luminous , strongly / efficiently accreting sources",
    ", it is proposed that the corona acts as a `` thermostat '' by ( compton ) cooling more efficiently when the disk emission increases , producing more soft photons , and thus steepening the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "this scenario also accounts nicely for the generally narrow range of @xmath4 and @xmath2 values measured in ( optically selected ) quasars or luminous agn , in general [ @xmath101 with a typical dispersion of a factor of @xmath102 ; @xcite .",
    "@xmath103 ; @xcite ] . for llagn ,",
    "the @xmath22 relation remains only vaguely constrained .",
    "the relation between the x - ray photon index @xmath2 and the eddington ratio for the champ x - ray detected galaxies is illustrated in figure  [ gamma_edd ] .",
    "the eddington luminosity @xmath104 is calculated as indicated in section  [ sequence ] , using @xmath14 values estimated based on stellar velocity dispersion @xmath87 via @xcite , while the bolometric luminosity is calculated based on @xmath0 , using the average bolometric correction of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "there is a rather clear trend of spectral hardening with increasing accretion rate . @xmath2 and @xmath4 are found to be negatively correlated .    defining an accretion rate , i.e. , calculating @xmath4 , for galaxies with @xmath106 erg s@xmath27 may be misleading if the x - ray emission in these objects is dominated by x - ray sources other than an accreting super massive bh ( e.g. , individual compact binaries or hot diffuse gas ) .",
    "note however that the @xmath107-axis of figure  [ gamma_edd ] is simply the measure of @xmath108 ( or better , @xmath109 ) , where both @xmath0 and the bh mass @xmath14 ( or @xmath87 ) are measured in exactly the same manner for all of the objects involved , and the trend remains even if this parameter is not interpreted as an accretion rate .",
    "the strongest likely dilution to accretion emission comes from contributions of the hot ism in passive galaxies .",
    "hot gas emission is soft , and relatively stronger in more massive hosts , both of which would push the passive galaxy points toward softer x - ray spectra ( larger @xmath110 and lower @xmath111 , which might spuriously accentuate the observed trend even in the absence of significant accretion power . indeed , the observed trend is weakened once the passive galaxies are removed ( table  [ lsf ] ) .",
    "so while we rule out significant extended emission contributions in this sample , more detailed examination of such objects is warranted to determine the relative fractions of nuclear vs. extended hot gas contributions .",
    "we measure the significance of the @xmath22 anti - correlation using the spearman - rank test .",
    "the spearman - rank coefficient , the chance probability , and the number of sources for each correlation are listed in table  [ spearman ] .",
    "we fit the anti - correlation points with a linear least - squares method for the whole sample and for the subsamples of galaxies corresponding to different spectral types , using the mpfit routine , being able to account for the errors in @xmath2 .",
    "we show , for comparison , both the error weighted ( continuous line ) and the unweighted ( dotted line ) best - fits in figure  [ gamma_edd ] .",
    "the scatter around the best linear fit is large , and as expected the points with the largest error bars show the largest deviation .",
    "however , within the errors , the results of the fit remain unchanged when we use only objects with small measurements errors ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) .",
    "the results for the linear regression coefficients and the corresponding @xmath39 and @xmath113 values are listed in table  [ lsf ] . for the sake of considering `` cleaner '' agn - like activity",
    "only , we also list here the results of such a fitting techniques to samples that exclude the passive galaxies and the h iis , and for samples of luminous x - ray systems ( @xmath114 erg s@xmath27 ) only , and indications of an anticorrelation , albeit weaker , remain .",
    "the linear regression fits might appear at odds with the conclusion of the spearman test , which indicates that @xmath2 and @xmath4 are possibly anticorrelated for all the subsamples presented here .",
    "note however that such a discrepancy appears for the subsamples where the spearman test remains rather inconclusive as , the probability that an anticorrelation appears by chance is large .",
    "moreover , the spearman test ignores the errors , and thus tests the unweighted data , for which linear regression fits are always consistent with negative slopes .",
    "it is clear however that for seyferts in particular , there is no evidence for either positive or negative correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this has been seen in other samples as well @xcite , and it is an important result .",
    "nevertheless , investigations of the llagn phenomenon should not be restricted to these types of sources only .    in an attempt to provide some more physical insights into the reality and significance of this new trend",
    ", we also explore here the possible correlations between various x - ray measures that might influence ( if not artificially create ) it .",
    "in particular , we scrutinize the way our measured @xmath2 relates to the number of counts , the x - ray flux and luminosity .",
    "some studies showed that the photon index correlates with the x - ray luminosity , becoming softer in more luminous sources , whether measured in soft , @xmath115 kev @xcite , or hard , @xmath116 kev @xcite bands only , or comprising the whole spectrum , and even as they vary @xcite .",
    "however , because many others have not found such trends , the idea that the choice of the sample involved in these studies may contribute to producing the correlations has also been put forward .",
    "interestingly , our champ sample does not show this correlation either .",
    "figure  [ gammal ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath2 measured in the @xmath44 kev range as a function of the total number of counts in this energy range , the x - ray flux , and the x - ray luminosity .",
    "as before , we emphasize the different optical spectral classifications ; the fact that , e.g. , the various types of galaxies separate rather well from each other in diagrams like this suggests that the correlation is physical , and most probably related to the accretion physics in these nuclei , rather than an artificial effect of fitting various ( simple ) models to their x - ray spectra .      the anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( or simply , @xmath108 ) that we find to characterize the nuclear emission of nearby galaxies is certainly surprising .",
    "this trend is opposite to what more luminous galaxy nuclei , i.e. , quasars , exhibit : their x - ray spectra soften as they become more luminous .",
    "figure  [ gamma_edd_qso ] shows the @xmath22 anti - correlation followed by the low luminosity galaxy nuclei along with measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath4 for a sample of sdss quasars with optical spectra that are champ detected and x - ray analysed in the same manner we handled our sample of nearby galaxy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the quasar @xmath4 values are obtained using the average bolometric correction of @xmath117 estimated by @xcite , with no luminosity - dependence , and the black hole masses from @xcite .    to ease comparison with previous work on quasars , we use in this plot the @xmath118 kev @xmath0 luminosity , which is obtained by extrapolating the measured unobscured @xmath119 value , using the best @xmath2 measurements .",
    "note that the anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 that nearby galaxy nuclei show is even more pronounced when the @xmath118 kev @xmath0 is plotted against @xmath2 .",
    "this is expected , as softer objects will be less luminous in @xmath116 kev than in the @xmath44 kev range , while the hard objects will be more luminous . the magnitude of this effect , i.e. , the ratio of the two @xmath0 values is a function of the photon index @xmath2 , as given by    @xmath120    the largest difference , and thus the most significant effect on the shape of the @xmath22 trend , is for the softest ( @xmath121 ) objects , however it does not exceed @xmath122 dex . note that for these particular objects the measurement errors are also among the highest , and hence contributed the least weight to the best - fit @xmath22 relation .",
    "the champ quasars fall well within the locus of values expected based on previous work .",
    "the champ quasars do not show , however , a clear @xmath22 positive correlation .",
    "the champ quasars span a wide range in redshift and their @xmath4 measurements reflect a mix of bh mass estimates based on all h@xmath51 , , and , which may add scatter to an underlying correlation @xcite .",
    "we show for comparison the results of linear regression fits of the @xmath22 correlation reported by @xcite and by @xcite , with the results for the @xmath123 and based estimates of the @xmath124 shown separately .",
    "note that we use here these data only for the purpose of global comparison of the quasar properties with those of the nearby galaxy nuclei , and do not attempt to improve upon the previous work on the characterization or calibration of the @xmath22 relation for quasars .",
    "clearly , the quasar @xmath2 s are not negatively correlated with their eddington ratios , even with the shift in @xmath0 produced by the energy conversion mentioned above , which might contribute to such trend ( the quasar x - ray data is analysed and measured via the same techniques employed for the nearby galaxy nuclei ) .",
    "thus , over the whole @xmath4 range we explore here by putting together luminous and weak agn , there is clearly a break in the @xmath125 correlation , which seems to happen at @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "it is important to note that , for the samples of quasars investigated by both @xcite and @xcite , the scatter in the claimed correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 is largest as the samples reach the weakest accretion rates ( while hardly reaching the @xmath128 level ) , and the hardest values ever measured for the quasar photon index @xmath127 ; while suggestive of a break , the quasar data alone can not however be used to single it out .",
    "other studies that include measurements of lower luminosity managed to point out these types of deviations from the expected correlation @xcite , however , the data remained sparse at those levels of accretion , leaving the effect unquantified .",
    "we note here that the comparison of the nearby galaxies central x - ray emission with that of the high redshift qsos may be inadequate since x - rays from sf activity is not yet accounted for in the former .",
    "we addressed this issue by including in the modelling of the original x - ray spectrum ( section  [ xanalysis ] ) a @xmath129 component with the expected @xmath130 .",
    "a power - law with @xmath129 provides the best simple description of the mix of hot gas and high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) that comprise the sf activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to estimate the potential @xmath130 in each galaxy , we use star - formation rates ( sfr ) calculated and available for these objects in the mpa / jhu catalog ( section  [ sample ] ; brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ) , along with the @xmath131 correlation quantified by gilvanov , grimm , & sunyaev ( 2004 ) .",
    "there are 83 objects with total @xmath0 above the line describing the @xmath131 correlation , for which we modelled the remaining - presumably agn component .",
    "this reanalysis produces significant deviations from the @xmath132 correlation only for 6% of the sample ( 5 out of the 83 objects involved in this analysis ) .",
    "the scatter and the error bars for both @xmath2 and @xmath0 are only slightly increased .",
    "the slope of the correlation flattens but remains consistent within the errors with our previous measurements .",
    "the x - ray photon index @xmath2 and the eddington ratio @xmath4 show a double - sloped relation , with positive and negative correlations above and below @xmath133 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "we see now that , a given agn spectral index @xmath2 may correspond to two different luminosity levels , with the luminosity difference greater for sources characterized by softer spectra ( figure  [ gamma_edd_qso ] ) .",
    "this break in the @xmath22 relation , when studied over a large range of accretion power , fits well into the theoretical ideas of a transition in the agn accretion mode : a standard @xcite accretion disk / corona at high eddington rates , i.e. , quasar phase , and an adaf @xcite at low @xmath4 .",
    "this break we find in the @xmath134 relation may provide the best empirical evidence to date for such a transition .    the inflection point in the @xmath22 relation",
    "is dominated by ts , consistent with the optical nature of these systems . while hypothesized to be the result of mixed agn and sf ionization @xcite , their agn component could be either an s- or l - like .",
    "ss appear to be the low @xmath85 quasar - like , efficiently accreting systems , while the ls are the adaf objects , so t s locus at the break region is suggestive of a switch in the accretion mode .",
    "the optically - defined ts are then transition systems that map the x - ray inflection as well .",
    "note that this idea of transition in the accretion mode , from adaf to standard - disk as the accretion rates increases , has been first proposed , and later developed , mainly based on results of investigations of smaller bh mass accretors , i.e. , stellar mass black - hole x - ray binaries , or xrbs ; see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "interestingly , the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath100 that xrbs exhibit in the different phases of their temporal variability is also multivalued : a given spectral index @xmath2 may correspond to two different luminosity levels , with the luminosity difference greater for sources characterized by softer spectra .",
    "that is , the xrbs show a positive @xmath22 correlation while in their high / soft states @xcite , and an anti - correlation while in their low / hard states @xcite .",
    "several clear examples of such a turn ( or convergence point ) in the @xmath125 relation measured in xrbs are illustrated in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .    in terms of the physical phenomenology governing the black hole accretion process over more than 10 orders of magnitude in the eddington ratio , the transition from an adaf to a standard disk accretion seems to adequately account for both the xrb and agn emission properties .",
    "the adaf scenario qualitatively explains the anti - correlation via comptonization of thermal synchrotron photons as the dominant cooling mechanism at low @xmath4 ratios : the compton @xmath135-parameter increases with increasing of the optical depth , which is caused by increase of the accretion rate , the x - ray spectrum becomes harder @xcite .",
    "further increase in the accretion rate would cause both an increase in the released energy and a decrease in the electron temperature , weakening the corona , and consequently the optical depth , reducing the @xmath135-parameter , and leading to softer spectra , and thus the positive @xmath23 correlation @xcite .",
    "the adaf scenario has been relatively successful in explaining a variety of the llagn properties @xcite , while the standard disk - corona model has been widely invoked to explain quasar emission .",
    "our finding of a non - monotonic @xmath22 relation seems to provide the first direct empirical link between these two different types of accretion in agn .",
    "the agn - xrb physical analogy has been discussed rather extensively @xcite , and is particularly supported by the two `` fundamental planes '' of the bh activity on all mass scales , the @xmath136 @xcite and the @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "there was however not much evidence for existence of spectral states in massive black holes , similar to those of the stellar black holes .",
    "our discovery of an anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and thus the discovery of a turning point in the @xmath22 relation for agn , provides this evidence , which constitutes an important empirical constraint to the idea that these systems are really the analogs of each other , in spite of the vast difference of scales .",
    "this study of serendipitous chandra nearby sources brings together for the first time a large homogeneous sample of active and inactive galaxy nuclei selected and classified based on their optical spectral properties . with a minimal selection bias",

    "the _ ( h ii @xmath1 ) seyfert @xmath1 transition object @xmath1 liner @xmath1 passive galaxy _ sequence suggested by a large variety of optical measures is supported by x - ray measurements . both the spectral shape and the accretion power , as measured by @xmath0 and the eddington ratio @xmath4 , with @xmath138 ,",
    "show a clear trend toward softer , less x - ray luminous and less actively accreting sources from @xmath83s to @xmath84s , to @xmath85s , and , at the end , the @xmath139 galaxies .",
    "the rather ambiguous ( in some optical properties ) succession of @xmath83 and @xmath84 phases is now significantly constrained by the x - ray activity to follow in a sense of decreasing accretion power .",
    "* there is a rather strong anti - correlation between the shape of the x - ray spectral energy distribution , quantified via the power - law index @xmath2 , and @xmath4 .",

    "the transition point is identical to that where stellar mass bh accretors ( xrbs ) exhibit their turn in analogous @xmath140 trends .",
    "the distribution of points within the observed @xmath140 relation exhibited by both weak and powerful agn might have other implications as well .",
    "the presence of some llagn below the @xmath142 turning point , which are mostly seyferts , suggests that obscuration might also play a role in shaping the observed @xmath140 trends at low and high @xmath5 .",
    "these particular objects rather hard photon indices must be the indication of gas absorption of their @xmath44 kev spectra .",
    "their eddington ratios huddle near the @xmath143 level , being generally weak when compared to the luminous quasars , and among the strongest llagn .",
    "thus , the anti - correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 shown by the nearby galaxy nuclei may well be interpreted as a relation between absorption and accretion rate , the objects accreting at higher rates being more obscured .    the probably naive extrapolation of this idea at higher @xmath100 suggests then that more active agn are also more absorbed .",
    "consequently , these increasingly absorbed systems , that would be the type 2 ones [ according to the agn `` unification '' scenario that separates ( the observed appearance of ) agn in terms of orientation relative to the line of sight ] would be decreasingly likely to be included in the ( current ) optically selected agn / quasar samples .",
    "this interpretation is certainly consistent with the general results of various quests for type 2 quasars : their x - ray spectra are harder than their type 1 counterparts @xcite , and they are highly obscured @xcite .",
    "the type 2 quasars are definitely scarce compared with the type 1 , and their fraction relative to that of the type 1 ones decreases with increasing luminosity @xcite .",
    "thus , this may as well be the explanation for the dearth of type 2 quasars .",
    "if the type 1 - 2 dichotomy and consequently the `` unification '' are only about the observing angle , the agn - galaxy evolutionary sequence suggested by the properties of the different types of nearby galactic nuclei should be even stronger once inclination effects are removed , as we would have a clearer view of the central engine .",
    "on the other hand , the 1 - 2 type separation , and thus the unification , might be the result of evolution .",
    "some simulations suggest that for the luminous quasars , the type 1 ( unobscured ) phase comes after a phase of `` blowing - out '' circumnuclear matter , which might mean after the quasars were observable as type 2 . by adding type 1 llagn to investigations of the @xmath140 connection we might be able to understand better the way the proposed evolutionary sequence does or does not challenge the unification scenario .    also , the exact location of the turning point in the @xmath140 relation remains to be better quantified in terms of both parameters .",
    "of particular caution is combining the @xmath4 measurements of llagn with those of quasars , mainly because the methods used in estimating their bh masses are not necessarily compatible .",
    "the bh masses of llagn are based on the @xmath144 relation , while the ( usually high @xmath5 ) quasar bh masses are obtained from the widths of the optical broad emission lines via scaling relations ; the scaling relations are calibrated on @xmath144 , which , recent work suggests , does not necessarily hold at high @xmath5 . another way of refining the exact location of the break lies of course in better estimates of @xmath2 , i.e. , higher quality ( higher signal - to - noise ) x - ray measurements , and/or larger samples .",
    "the latter alternative , in particular , seems to be feasible , as larger and larger samples of well characterized samples of optically selected agn become available for cross - correlation with x - ray detections from , e.g. , serendipitous surveys like champ .    future work ( constantin & champ 2009 , in prep . ) will explore the multi - wavelength properties of a large sample of agn that brings together nearby llagn of type 2 with nearby quasars ( type 1 agn ) , thus attempting to reconcile both the type 1 - 2 dichotomy and the problem of mix - matching bh masses , along with providing larger statistics , and better means of quantifying extrinsic effects such as absorption and non - thermal processes ( i.e. , comptonized emission from the accretion disk s corona ) that enable improved constraints to the analogy with xrbs .",
    "we will also address in this work the biases that are potentially present in the previously claimed relationships between the between @xmath0 and optical emission line luminosities for llagn , together with the impact of using optical emission lines to estimate @xmath94 , and thus to the overall shape of the @xmath145 relation .",

    "<S> @xmath7 quasars relation occurs near @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this is identical to what stellar mass x - ray binaries exhibit , indicating that we have probably found the first empirical evidence for an intrinsic switch in the accretion mode , from advection - dominated flows to standard ( disk / corona ) accretion modes in supermassive black hole accretors , similar to what has been seen and proposed to happen in stellar mass black hole systems . </S>",
