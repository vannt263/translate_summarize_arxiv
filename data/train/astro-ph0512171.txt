    "it has been speculated that some of the most luminous known globular clusters might be the remnants of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies nuclei @xcite .",
    "the study of globular clusters in m31 was initiated by @xcite , who discovered 140 gcs with @xmath11 mag .",
    "the continued importance of the study of gcs in this galaxy has been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "m31 globular cluster b327 ( b for ` baade ' ) or bo037 ( bo for ` bologna ' , see battistini 1987 ) , which , in the nomenclature introduced by @xcite will subsequently be referred to as 037-b327 .",
    "the extremely red color of this object was first noted by @xcite .",
    "the brightest globular clusters in m31 are more luminous than the giant galactic cluster @xmath10 centauri . among these",
    "are 037-b327 @xcite and g1 ( see details from * ? ? ?",
    "the latter has been considered as the possible remnant core of a former dwarf galaxy which lost most of its envelope through tidal interactions with m31 @xcite .",
    "subsequently @xcite strengthened the @xcite and @xcite conclusion .    in this paper , we have determined the structural parameters of 037-b327 using its deep image obtained with the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath12 .",
    "combined with the previous photometry , we find that this cluster lies in the same region of the log @xmath9 versus @xmath8 diagram as do @xmath10 centauri , m54 and ngc 2419 in the milky way and g1 in m31 .",
    "this suggests that 037-b327 may also be the remnant core of a now defunct dwarf companion to the andromeda galaxy .",
    "we searched the @xmath13 archive and found 037-b327 to have been observed with the acs - wide field channel ( wfc ) in the f606w and the f814w bands .",
    "we mainly used the image in f606w , which was observed on 2004 august 2 with 2370.0 seconds of exposure time .",
    "we deconvolve the image using the iraf task lucy @xcite .",
    "the image of 037-b327 observed in the f606 and its deconvolved counterpart are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the central structure is clearly more complex in the deconvolved image .",
    "the @xmath13 acs - wfc resolution is @xmath14 per pixel .",
    "we used the iraf task ellipse to fit the image with a series of elliptical annuli from the center to the outskirts , with the length of the semi - major axis increasing by 10% in each step .",
    "figure 2 shows the ellipticity and position angle , plotted as a function of the semi - major axis .",
    "the ellipticity varies significantly with position along the semi - major axis @xmath15 .",
    "the mean ellipticity is @xmath16 .",
    "the position angle p.a . is not significantly variable for semi - major axis values @xmath15 larger than @xmath17 .",
    "it is of interest to note that the high ellipticity of 037-b327 , which is the most luminous cluster in m31 , confirms the empirical rule @xcite that the brightest globular cluster in a galaxy is also usually one of the most flattened ones",
    ". the ellipticities and position angles shown in fig .",
    "2 ( particularly near @xmath18 ) are quite strongly affected by the dust lane .",
    "we fitted king models @xcite to the surface brightness profiles .",
    "as usual , we parameterize the model with the core radius @xmath19 , the concentration index @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the tidal radius . ) , and @xmath22 , the central surface brightness .",
    "the derived parameters are : the core radius @xmath23 , the tidal radius @xmath24 , implying the concentration index @xmath5 .",
    "the surface brightness profile appears to be essentially flat within @xmath6 of the center and shows no signs of core collapse .",
    "the central surface brightness is @xmath25 .",
    "figure 3 plots the surface brightness profile and a fitted king model . as we noted",
    ", this cluster contains a clear dust lane ( see from the images in figure 1 , especially from the deconvolved image ) .",
    "so , some data points are affected by this dust lane , which is evident in figure 3 . except for some photometric data affected badly by the dust lane",
    ", the king model fits the surface brightness profile well .",
    "we also calculate the half - light radius ( the radius that contains half of the light in projection ) to be @xmath26 . with an adopted a distance to m31 of 770 kpc @xcite , the core radius , the half - light radius and the tidal radius",
    "are @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "037-b327 is remarkable for being the most luminous and the most highly reddened @xcite cluster in m31 .",
    "@xcite determined magnitudes of 257 m31 gc candidates in the @xmath30 photometric system including 037-b327 . using his photometric catalog",
    ", @xcite studied the intrinsic colors of m31 gcs , and found that 037-b327 was the most highly reddened with @xmath31 in his sample of m31 gc candidates . using low - resolution spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite also found this cluster to be the most highly reddened gc candidate in m31 , with @xmath32 . with a large database of multicolor photometry",
    ", @xcite determined the reddening value for each individual m31 gc including 037-b327 using the correlations between optical and infrared colors and metallicity by defining various `` reddening - free '' parameters .",
    "again , @xcite derived the reddening value for this cluster , using the spectroscopic metallicity to predict the intrinsic colors .",
    "the dust lane showed in figure 3 , might be responsible for the bulk of the reddening . in this paper",
    ", we adopted @xmath33 for 037-b327 derived by @xcite by the weighted combination of values from their two methods ( see details from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath34 presented by @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath35 and a distance to m31 of 770 kpc @xcite , the absolute magnitude of 037-b327 is @xmath36 , which makes it the most luminous globular cluster in m31 .",
    "as a globular cluster evolves its core contracts and its envelope expands .",
    "however , it has been shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that the half - light radius of an evolving cluster changes little over periods as long as 10 relaxation times .",
    "the half - light radius of a cluster therefore can be used to trace the initial size of a cluster , and hence the physical conditions in its host galaxy at early epochs . in previous papers @xcite",
    ", it was showed that three galactic globular clusters and one m31 globular cluster lie above and to the brightward of the line    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the half - light radius and the absolute magnitude of a globular cluster .",
    "figure 11 of @xcite showed that the overwhelming majority of normal globular clusters lie below and to the faintward of the line defined by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the clusters that do fall above the relation defined by equation ( 1 ) are mostly objects suspected of being the cores of now defunct dwarf galaxies .",
    "figure 4 shows a plot of @xmath40 versus @xmath39 . on this plot 037-b327",
    "is seen to lie above and to the brightward of the line defined by equation ( 1 ) as do @xmath10 centauri , m54 and ngc 2419 in the milky way and the massive cluster g1 in m31 .",
    "all four of these objects have been suggested to be the stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "this result suggests that the most luminous cluster 037-b327 in m31 may also be the stripped core of a now defunct dwarf companion to m31 .",
    "in this paper , we determine the structural parameters of 037-b327 that were derived from an f606w image that was obtained with the advanced camera for surveys on the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , by fitting between the surface brightness distribution and the king model .",
    "combined with the previous photometry , we find that this object falls in the same region of the @xmath8 versus @xmath9 diagram as do @xmath10 centauri , m54 and ngc 2419 in the milky way and the massive cluster g1 in m31 on the size ( log @xmath9 ) versus luminosity ( @xmath41 diagram .",
    "all four of these objects have been suggested to be the stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies .",
    "so , we argue that 037-b327 may also be the core of a former dwarf spheroidal companion to m31 .",
    "we also compared the images of the f606w and f814w , and did not find any difference in the colors of the brightest incipiently resolved stars , where this term is used in the sense that the image is not clearly resolved into individual stars , but has a mottled or granular appearance , which was employed by @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the first anonymous referee for catching our error in the m31 image scale .",
    "we are also indebt to the second anonymous referee for his / her insightful comments and suggestions that improved this paper greatly .",
