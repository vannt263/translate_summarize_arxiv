    "inorganic fullerene - like ( if ) nanostructures have recently attracted attention due to their unique closed cage structures and outstanding solid - state lubricating behavior @xcite . just as carbon fullerenes are nanoscale analogs of layered graphite , if nanoparticles and nanotubes are curved analogs of the corresponding quasi - two - dimensional material .",
    "layered and nanoscale metal dichalcogenides are prototypes in this regard , and the discovery of the ws@xmath0-based family of if nanoparticles ( fig .  [ fig_ws2nanoparticleb ] ) provides the opportunity to investigate structure - property relations in bulk vs. nanoscale materials . at the same time , the if materials hold out the potential for important applications .",
    "in addition to use in rechargeable batteries , optical devices , and in impact - resistant nanocomposities , extensive mechanical properties testing demonstrates that the friction coefficient of if - ws@xmath0 nanoparticles is reduced up to 50% compared with the 2h - ws@xmath0 parent compound , maintaining excellent lubricating behavior even under very high loads , ultra - high vacuum , and in humid conditions @xcite . because of these observations ,",
    "major efforts have been directed at understanding the connection between bulk and microscopic properties and exploiting the commercial promise of these novel nanomaterials .",
    "2h - ws@xmath0 belongs to the space group p6@xmath2/mmc ( @xmath3 ) and contains two formula units per unit cell @xcite .",
    "the bonding is well - known to consist of strong covalent intralayer forces and weak van der waals interactions between adjacent layers @xcite .",
    "each mx@xmath0 layer ( m = group vib metal , x = group via element ) contains a layer of metal atoms , sandwiched between two chalcogen layers , with each metal atom bonded to six chalcogen atoms in a trigonal prismatic arrangement .",
    "a group theoretical analysis ( table  [ tab_ws2group ] , appendix ) gives a total of 18 normal modes @xcite .",
    "the doubly degenerate e@xmath1 and singly degenerate a@xmath4 vibrational modes are infrared active ; the conjugate gerade modes are raman active .",
    "figure [ fig_ws2mode ] displays the relevant displacement vectors .",
    "note that the infrared active _ xy_-polarized e@xmath1 and _",
    "z_-polarized a@xmath4 modes are associated with intralayer and interlayer motion , respectively .",
    "this directional selectivity provides a sensitive and microscopic probe of charge and bonding interactions that we will employ in this work to assess effective total and local charge differences between the bulk and nanoscale materials @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction reveals that the local structure of 2h - ws@xmath0 is preserved within the unit cell of an if nanoparticle with the exception of a 2% lattice expansion along the _ z_-axis @xcite .",
    "this lattice expansion is attributed to strain in the curved ws@xmath0 layers @xcite , each of which has a slightly different radius due to layer inhomogeneities ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ws2nanoparticleb](b ) ) .",
    "the lattice modes of 2h - ws@xmath0 were previously investigated using combined raman and inelastic neutron scattering , demonstrating that the two - phonon resonance raman effects are second - order processes involving the longitudinal acoustic mode at the k point of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "previous studies also indicate that the new raman peaks in spectra of if - ws@xmath0 nanotubes and nanoparticles should be assigned as disorder - induced zone edge phonons @xcite .",
    "more recent raman work demonstrates that the 33 @xmath5 e@xmath6 shearing or ",
    "rigid layer \" mode is almost completely blocked in if - ws@xmath0 due to surface strain hindering intralayer motion in the nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "extensive optical properties and stm work indicates that the indirect gap is smaller in the if nanoparticles compared to that in the bulk @xcite .",
    "a and b exciton positions are also sensitive to confinement and the number of layers in the nanoparticle @xcite .    in order to investigate structure - property relationships in these chemically identical but morphologically different metal dichalcogenides , we measured the infrared reflectance spectra of both 2h- and if - ws@xmath0 powders and performed a charge analysis to extract total and local effective charge from the oscillator parameters of the major infrared active phonon modes .",
    "we found an approximate 1.5:1 intralayer charge difference between the 2h- bulk and if - nanoparticle materials , respectively .",
    "the trend is different in the interlayer direction , reflecting a slightly enhanced @xmath7 interaction in the nanoparticles .",
    "we discuss how differences in both charge and strain may be connected to the macroscopic properties of these materials .",
    "if - ws@xmath0 was prepared from its oxide precursor , wo@xmath2 , following previously published procedures @xcite . the if nanoparticles of interest in this work range in size from @xmath8120 - 200 nm in diameter .",
    "the particle size , shape and distribution have been studied by x - ray powder diffraction @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , and high - resolution transmission electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "pressed isotropic pellets were prepared to investigate the dynamical properties .",
    "bulk 2h - ws@xmath0 was also measured for comparison ( alfa aesar , 99.8% ) .",
    "near - normal infrared reflectance was measured over a wide frequency range using a series of spectrometers including a bruker 113v fourier transform infrared spectrometer , an equinox 55 fourier transform instrument ( equipped with a microscope attachment ) , and a perkin elmer lambda 900 grating spectrometer , covering the frequency range from 25 - 52000 @xmath5 .",
    "a helium - cooled bolometer detector was employed in the far - infrared for added sensitivity .",
    "both 0.5 and 2 @xmath5 resolution were used in the infrared , whereas 3 nm resolution was used in the optical regime .",
    "variable temperature measurements were carried out with a continuous - flow helium cryostat and temperature controller .",
    "a kramers - kronig analysis was used to calculate the optical constants from the measured reflectance , yielding information on the dispersive and lossy response of each material @xcite .",
    "standard peak - fitting techniques were employed , where appropriate .",
    "figure  [ fig_ws2300kref ] displays a close - up view of the far infrared reflectance spectra of 2h- and if - ws@xmath0 at 300 k. we assign the major features in the reflectance ( at 356 and 437 @xmath5 ) as the e@xmath1 and a@xmath4 modes , respectively @xcite .",
    "these modes are strikingly different in the two materials .",
    "the e@xmath1 mode appears damped and suppressed in if - ws@xmath0 compared to the 2h- analog , whereas the a@xmath4 mode is slightly more pronounced in the if compound compared to that in the bulk .",
    "these differences can be quantified using traditional dielectric oscillator models and fitting techniques which , in combination with appropriate models , allow us to assess the charge characteristics of the nanomaterial as compared to the bulk .",
    "these optical constants include the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the energy loss function , @xmath12im(1/@xmath13(@xmath14 ) ) , and the optical conductivity , @xmath15 . in our analysis ,",

    "z_-polarized interlayer a@xmath4 mode .",
    "the model for localized charge is developed for studying only the intralayer e@xmath1 mode in the layered 2h bulk material @xcite . since the lorentz factor is negative for the a@xmath4 mode , no realistic charge values could be determined .",
    "formally , the local site symmetry of a curved sheet is c@xmath19 , and all a modes are active . but practically , the nanoparticle curvature is small , so it is useful to consider the additional spectral features as perturbations to the planar picture .        within the clusters centered at @xmath8347 , 379 , and 426 @xmath5",
